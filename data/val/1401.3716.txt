    "from the very beginning of condensed matter physics , solid state theory relied on two complementary approaches : model - building and the use of general principles .",
    "the atomistic model was invoked by early crystallographers to explain the laws of crystal habit @xcite ; more than 400 years ago , kepler speculated about the connection of the shape of a snowflake with the dense packing of spheres @xcite .",
    "the simple drude @xcite and sommerfeld @xcite models of metals were followed by a more realistic band theory of solids @xcite .",
    "later , improved models that incorporate electron interactions led to some of the greatest triumphs of condensed matter physics including the fermi - liquid theory @xcite and the explanation of superconductivity @xcite .",
    "any recent issue of this journal contains articles on the hubbard , tomonaga - luttinger , kondo or other models of materials .    in some cases it is possible to obtain nontrivial predictions without the use of models , solely from the basic principles of quantum and statistical mechanics .",
    "thermodynamics is a particularly powerful source of such predictions and einstein famously said @xcite : `` a theory is the more impressive the greater the simplicity of its premises is , the more different kinds of things it relates , and the more extended is its area of applicability .",
    "therefore the deep impression which classical thermodynamics made upon me . ''",
    "einstein himself made some of the most brilliant predictions from general principles by his masterful use of detailed balance @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation relations , addressed in this review , are a far - reaching development of his ideas .",
    "early milestones in the field , opened by einstein , included the nyquist formula @xcite and the onsager reciprocity relations @xcite .",
    "their generalization led to the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite ( fdt ) and the linear response theory @xcite .",
    "another breakthrough in the application of general principles to many - body systems came from the idea of universality @xcite .",
    "it allowed a precise quantitative description of critical phenomena from the symmetry considerations without any microscopic information @xcite .    these and other achievements greatly advanced the theory of condensed matter in and close to thermal equilibrium . on the other hand ,",
    "far from equilibrium , little could be told without the resort to microscopic models @xcite .",
    "that situation changed in the 1990s , when the discovery of fluctuation relations brought a powerful general principle to nonequilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "the key idea behind fluctuation relations is similar to the principle of detailed balance .",
    "consider a time - reversal - invariant system in an initial state @xmath0 .",
    "the system evolves during the time @xmath1 . from the unitarity of quantum mechanics ,",
    "the probability to find the system in the final state @xmath2 is exactly the same as the probability to find the system with the initial state @xmath3 in the final state @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the time - reversal operator .",
    "we now consider a process made of the following three steps :    \\1 ) the initial state of the system is measured ;    \\2 ) the system undergoes unitary evolution over the time interval @xmath1 ;    \\3 ) the final state is determined through measurement .",
    "the probability to observe the evolution from @xmath0 into @xmath2 is no longer the same as the probability to observe the evolution from @xmath6 to @xmath7 since the probabilities to find the system in the initial states @xmath0 and @xmath6 are not the same away from thermal equilibrium .",
    "however , it is often possible to write a simple relation between the two probabilities @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , allows a derivation of numerous relations between correlation functions of observables . in this review",
    "we will be particularly interested in the correlation functions of electric currents .",
    "one might think that all this is of no use in the absence of time - reversal symmetry , e.g. , when an external magnetic field is applied .",
    "indeed , most work on fluctuation relations assumes the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "however , it transpired recently that a number of nontrivial fluctuation relations hold even without such symmetry .",
    "one result @xcite connects systems that transform into each other under the action of the time - reversal operator .",
    "a family of relations has been found for nonlinear transport coefficients of a system , close to thermal equilibrium , at two opposite directions of the magnetic field .",
    "another result @xcite applies even far away from equilibrium and connects non - linear response and noise at a fixed direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the latter result holds in chiral systems .",
    "since the word `` chirality '' has all too many meanings , we need to explain ours .",
    "by chiral we mean systems , where excitations can propagate in one direction only , that is , either all excitations can propagate only clockwise or all excitations can only propagate counterclockwise . such transport is known to occur on the edges of certain quantum hall liquids and in some other systems .",
    "there has been much recent interest in chiral transport in the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) .",
    "the interest comes , in part , from the search for elusive neutral modes @xcite . besides",
    ", the question of chirality proved relevant for the ongoing search for non - abelian anyons @xcite in quantum hall states in the second landau level ( see section 4 ) .",
    "the more powerful fluctuation relations @xcite in chiral systems originate from a stronger form of the causality principle for chiral transport .",
    "the standard causality principle states that the past is not affected by the future events . in the chiral case , in addition , one of the following two alternatives holds : either what happens on the right is not affected by the past events on the left or what happens on the left is not affected by the past events on the right .    in this review",
    "we address theoretical and experimental work on fluctuation relations in the absence of the time - reversal symmetry in chiral and non - chiral systems .",
    "many questions remain open and we discuss future directions in section 6 .",
    "we also address the ongoing controversy about microreversibility without the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section",
    "we derive the quantum fluctuation theorem @xcite that serves as a foundation for all subsequent discussion . in section 3",
    ", we extract from that theorem the saito - utsumi relations @xcite for the nonlinear transport coefficients of identical systems in the opposite magnetic fields .",
    "we also address the verification of the saito - utsumi relations in microscopic models and the experimental results @xcite . in section 4",
    "we introduce chiral systems with the emphasis on qhe .",
    "we derive fluctuation relations @xcite for chiral systems in section 5 .",
    "finally , we address open problems and summarize in section 6 .",
    "equilibrium reservoirs . chemical potential difference or temperature difference between any two reservoirs will induce particle current and@xmath8or heat current . ]    in statistical mechanics , physical quantities of interest usually undergo random fluctuations .",
    "_ fluctuation theorems _ are a class of exact relations for the distribution functions of those random fluctuations , regardless whether the system under investigation is in an equilibrium or nonequilibrium state .",
    "there are fluctuation theorems for , e.g , entropy in driven isolated systems , work and heat in closed systems , _",
    "etc_. fluctuation theorems are typically of the form @xcite @xmath9 , \\label{ftgeneral}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the physical quantity or the collection of quantities under investigation , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the distribution functions of @xmath10 in the so - called _ forward _ and _ backward _ processes respectively , and the constants @xmath13 and @xmath14 are determined by the initial conditions of the two processes .",
    "the definitions of the forward and backward processes may differ slightly for different systems , but in general they follow these lines : 1 ) initially in both processes , the system obeys a gibbs distribution or can be factorized into several subsystems that obey gibbs distributions and 2 ) the dynamical equations ( e.g. , the schrdinger equation ) in the backward process is obtained from the dynamical equations in the forward process by the time - reversal operation . generally speaking , the system in the forward process and the system in the backward process should not be considered as the same system because they follow different microscopic dynamical equations . however , for a system with the time - reversal symmetry , the dynamical equation is the same in the forward and backward processes . hence , provided that the initial gibbs distributions in the two processes are the same , no difference exists between the two processes for a time - reversal invariant system , and thereby the subindices @xmath15 and @xmath16 in ( [ ftgeneral ] ) can be dropped .    in this review , we consider systems without the time - reversal symmetry , and focus on a particular fluctuation theorem for energy and particle transport in quantum open systems .",
    "this fluctuation theorem is very useful for studying transport phenomena in systems without the time - reversal symmetry , and , particularly , in systems with chirality ( see sections 4 and 5 ) . for a reader , interested in other fluctuation theorems ,",
    "many excellent reviews exist , for example , refs . .",
    "the approach of this section builds on refs . and closely follows supplementary information to ref . .",
    "let us discuss the specific fluctuation theorem that we are interested in .",
    "we consider a setup shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] : the system in the center is coupled to @xmath17 reservoirs , each being in equilibrium .",
    "the system serves as a bridge , so that energy and particles can be transported between the reservoirs .",
    "this setup is commonly used in transport experiments with mesoscopic systems , such as quantum dots , quantum hall bars , _ etc_. a _",
    "forward _ process can then be defined as follows .",
    "initially , at @xmath18 , the system and reservoirs are decoupled .",
    "an interaction @xmath19 that allows particle and energy exchange with the reservoirs is turned on at the times @xmath20 .",
    "the interaction is turned off at @xmath21 . at @xmath18 ,",
    "reservoir @xmath22 is at equilibrium with the inverse temperature @xmath23 and the chemical potential @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the charge of a charge carrier and @xmath26 the electric potential .",
    "we use only one set of chemical potentials and thus assume that only one carrier type is present which is usually electron .",
    "we assume that the size of the system is much smaller than that of the reservoirs , so its initial state is irrelevant in the @xmath27 limit which we will take .",
    "it is convenient to regroup the system with one of the reservoirs@xcite , for example , the @xmath17-th reservoir .",
    "the interaction @xmath19 becomes a constant @xmath28 when fully turned on during @xmath29 .",
    "we assume that @xmath30 and @xmath31 is much longer than the relaxation time so that the system remains in a steady state during most of the time interval @xmath31 .",
    "we now find the statistical distribution of the changes @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the particle number and @xmath35 is the energy of the @xmath22-th reservoir .",
    "let @xmath36 and @xmath37 be the hamiltonian and particle number operators of the @xmath22-th reservoir ( @xmath38 includes the system ) .",
    "the particle numbers conserve in the absence of @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath39=0 $ ] .",

    "an initial joint quantum measurement of @xmath36 and @xmath37 is performed at @xmath46 , so that the quantum state of the system collapses to a common eigenstate @xmath43 with the probability @xmath47 .",
    "the state @xmath43 then evolves according to the evolution operator @xmath48 , which satisfies @xmath49 where the hamiltonian @xmath50 , and the initial condition is @xmath51 . at @xmath52 , a second joint measurement is taken , leading to the collapse of the system to the state @xmath53 with the reservoir energies @xmath54 and particle numbers @xmath55 .",

    "the energy conservation is an approximation due to the time - dependent interaction @xmath19 .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath27 , the violation of the energy conservation is negligible since the time - dependence is relevant only during a short period of time @xmath63 .",
    "we now study the _ backward _ process . in that process , the initial temperatures and chemical potentials of the reservoirs are the same as those in the forward process .",

    "the crucial assumption behind our derivation is microreversibility : we assume that after the magnetic field , the velocities of all particles and their spins are reversed , the system traces its evolution backwards . as was pointed out in refs .",
    ", such assumption is counterintuitive in mesoscopic systems without time - reversal symmetry .        consider a mesoscopic conductor , connected to several infinite reservoirs , maintained at different voltages . a standard way to calculate currents and noises",

    "one first finds the self - consistent charge density @xmath152 as a function of the coordinates in the conductor .",
    "the charge distribution creates a self - consistent electrostatic potential .",
    "the currents and noises can be computed from the scattering theory for free particles , entering the mesoscopic conductor from the reservoirs , and moving in the self - consistent potential in the conductor .",

    "indeed , @xmath153 is not the same as the charge distribution @xmath154 in the opposite field . fig .",
    "[ ccc ] illustrates why . in that oversimplified example",
    ", charged particles can enter a square box through holes 1 and 3 only . at one direction of the magnetic field ,",
    "particles from hole 1 move into hole 2 and particles from hole 3 move into hole 4 . at the opposite field",
    "the particle trajectories connect hole 1 with 4 and 2 with 3 . since the charge density is nonzero only on those trajectories , @xmath155 .",
    "the self - consistent electrostatic potentials depend on @xmath156 and are different in the opposite magnetic fields .",
    "consider now a scattering process in which a particle with the momentum @xmath157 acquires the momentum @xmath158 at the magnetic field b. the scattering amplitude depends on the self - consistent electrostatic potential @xmath159 .",
    "the scattering probability for the time - reversed process at the field @xmath160 describes the transition form the state with the momentum @xmath161 into the state with the momentum @xmath162 .",
    "it depends on a different self - consistent potential @xmath163 and hence is different from the scattering probability @xmath164 in the field @xmath16",
    ". such asymmetry of the self - consistent potential is closely related to the physics of rectification in mesoscopic conductors @xcite .",
    "the above argument does not by itself disprove microreversibility .",
    "indeed , it is a mean - field argument which deals with single - particle states . on the other hand , the proof of the fluctuation theorem , section 2 , considers many - particle states .",
    "the unitarity of the evolution operator in quantum mechanics shows that the transition probability between the many - body states of the whole system , @xmath165 , always equals @xmath166 . in each point , the charge densities in the forward and backward processes remain exactly the same in the corresponding moments of time .",
    "hence , the electrostatic potentials do , in fact , remain the same . the mean - field argument is based on the different charge distributions in the steady states in the opposite magnetic fields . however , if one reverses time in a system in a steady state then the charge distribution does not change and hence does not become the steady state distribution of the electric charge in the opposite magnetic field .",
    "we would like to emphasize that time - reversal in an interacting macroscopic system is not mathematical fiction .",
    "it was demonstrated experimentally long ago in the context of nmr @xcite .",
    "several groups have verified the fluctuation relations at a finite magnetic field without the use of microreversibility .",
    "the saito - utsumi relations were confirmed by microscopic calculations beyond the landauer - bttiker formalism in two models @xcite .",

    "agrees with eq .",
    "( [ dima14 ] ) .",
    "the fluctuation relations for a general chiral system from section 5 below were derived both from microreversibility @xcite and without its use @xcite .",
    "recent experiments @xcite were interpreted as supporting the fluctuation relations @xcite ( see the next subsection ) .",
    "while all this gives credibility to the approach , based on microreversibility , one must remember some subtleties .",
    "all models in refs . assume a finite range of the electrostatic interaction .",
    "this implies the presence of screening gates .",
    "the gates are crucial for the fluctuation relations in chiral systems @xcite since it is meaningful to speak about chiral transport only in systems with short - range interactions ( section 4 ) . at the same time",
    ", the saito - utsumi relations do not make assumptions about the range of interactions .",
    "yet , our derivation of the fluctuation theorem , section 2 , implicitly assumes short - range forces .",
    "indeed , in the presence of the long - range coulomb interaction , the reservoirs are not independent even in the beginning of the forward and backward processes and can not be described by the gibbs distribution .",
    "certainly , this is a rather standard issue .",
    "it can be resolved by splitting the coulomb force into a finite - range part with some large but finite interaction radius and the long - range part which must be treated in the mean - field approximation .",
    "this allows using the gibbs distribution but returns the problem from the landauer - bttiker approach .",
    "indeed , the average charge densities are not the same at the opposite field orientations and hence the mean - field effective long - range potentials are not the same in the forward and backward process . fortunately ,",
    "if the reservoirs are sufficiently large and the radius of the finite - range interaction is selected large enough , one can see that the difference of the long - range potentials can be neglected .",
    "another issue equally affects systems with and without the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "our derivation , section 2 , assumes that the system is isolated .",
    "this may not be easy to accomplish in practice .",
    "moreover , if this has been accomplished then no experiments can be performed since any measurement device disturbs the system .",
    "fortunately , energy exchange with the outside world turns out not to be a problem provided the temperature of the environment is the same as the temperature of the system of interest .",

    "one just needs to include the qpc , connected to two reservoirs at different electrochemical potentials , into the system under consideration .",

    "this generality comes at a price .",

    "this was explained by kane , fisher and polchinsky @xcite who uncovered the nontrivial role of impurities which are inevitably present along qhe edges .",
    "impurities promote tunneling between the contra - propagating edge channels and change the nature of the edge modes : all charge excitations move in the same direction , called downstream ; in addition , a neutral excitation branch of the opposite , i.e. , upstream , chirality emerges .",
