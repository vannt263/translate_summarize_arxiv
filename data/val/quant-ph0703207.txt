    "recently much theoretical research work has been focused on the possibility to use systems of spins , coupled by ferromagnetic heisenberg interactions and arranged along chain structures , for transferring quantum information .",
    "the remarkable property of these systems is the capability of transmitting the qubit state along the chain with fidelity exceeding the classical threshold and by means only of their free dynamical evolution . after the seminal paper by bose @xcite , in which the potentialities of the so - called spin chains have been shown ,",
    "several strategies have been proposed to increase the transmission fidelity @xcite and even to achieve , under appropriate conditions , perfect state transfer @xcite .",
    "all these proposals refer to ideal spin chains in which only nearest - neighbor couplings are present . however , also",
    "the more realistic case of long range couplings , in particular magnetic dipole like couplings , has been studied @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that perfect state transfer or , at least , high transmission fidelity can be obtained by appropriately choosing the system parameters , such as local magnetic fields and inter - spin distances .",
    "moreover , even when no site specific locally - tunable fields are allowed , spin chains with dipolar couplings often perform better , in terms of transmission fidelity , than their nearest - neighbor coupled counterpart @xcite . hence , from these theoretical predictions",
    ", we expect that spin chains , also in the case of long range interactions , may represent a very promising system to achieve high fidelity quantum information transfer without requiring experimentally demanding gating operations .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that a linear array of electrons , confined in micro - penning traps , can implement an effective spin chain with magnetic dipole like spin coupling .",
    "the same system consisting of trapped electrons in vacuum has been already proposed as a valid and competitive candidate for universal quantum information processing @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the possibility of reliably transmitting the qubit state between different quantum registers , without applying gate operations , is highly desirable .",
    "in fact , the use of a quantum channel to transfer a qubit state in a quantum processor can be a valuable alternative to the repeated application of swapping gates .",
    "we have already proved in @xcite that the addition of a magnetic field gradient , together with the coulomb interaction between the particles , allows to obtain an effective nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr)-like coupling between the spins of the confined electrons . here",
    "we generalize this approach to encompass a variety of trap set up , also in connection with novel geometries of penning traps @xcite .",
    "indeed , by further investigating the interaction between the internal ( spin ) and external ( motional ) degrees of freedom of each particle , introduced by the applied local magnetic field gradient , we can mimic more general systems , with heisenberg ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic hamiltonian .",
    "this fact opens up the possibility to simulate quantum spin systems with tunable interactions , thanks to the experimental control over the different trap parameters .",
    "the ultimate goal may be the observation of quantum phase transitions , as proposed with trapped ions controlled by laser beams @xcite .    in our proposal ,",
    "we consider a linear array of electrons with inter - particle distance ranging from few microns to 50  @xmath0 m .",
    "we provide an analytical expression for the spin - spin coupling strength , which shows a dipolar decay law .",
    "we estimate the value of the spin - spin coupling , for different ranges of the system characteristic frequencies as well as of the intensity of the magnetic gradient , with the aim of optimizing the transfer time of our quantum channel .",
    "furthermore , we evaluate the fidelity of our system in reproducing an effective spin chain according to the heisenberg model . in particular , we calculate the probability to obtain a perfect spin state transfer in a chain consisting of just two electrons . this probability , equal to one in an ideal spin chain @xcite , in our system is less than one owing to the effects resulting from the interplay between the internal and the external degrees of freedom of the trapped particles .",
    "however , by an appropriate choice of the system parameters , especially the frequency and the amplitude of the spatial motions , we can obtain high fidelities and , at the same time , sufficiently large values of the spin - spin coupling .",
    "the electron trapping arrangement offers also the possibility to apply arbitrary site - specific changes in the system parameters in order to maximize , as outlined in @xcite , the efficiency of the quantum channel .",
    "our theoretical predictions suggest that a linear array of electrons is suitable to implement a spin chain with the present technology .",

    "[ system ] we describe the system and how the local magnetic field gradient couples the electron spin to the motional degrees of freedom .",

    "the first two effects are rather small and can be taken into account by redefining the trap center position and the corresponding axial frequency .",

    "( [ hc6 ] ) , this is , in general , no longer true . indeed , even though the leading terms are preserving the energy of the two coupled cyclotron oscillators , we also note the presence of rapidly rotating terms which involve the simultaneous creation and annihilation of two excitations .",

    "( [ hc5 ] ) and ( [ hc7 ] ) exhibit alternating signs in front of the coupling terms .",
    "as we will see in the next section , this results in a different kind , ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic , of the effective spin - spin interaction .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that the magnetic gradient induces , for each particle of the array , a coupling between the spatial and the spin motions .",
    "this interaction , mediated by the coulomb repulsion between the electrons , gives rise to an effective spin - spin coupling between different particles @xcite .",

    "this effect was already pointed out in ref .",
    "moreover , we note that the unitary transformation enforces a coupling between the axial motion of the @xmath8-th electron and the spin of the @xmath7-th electron .",
    "this effect is smaller of a factor @xmath63 than the corresponding coupling [ see eq .",
    "( [ h_nc_rwa ] ) ] between internal ( spin ) and external ( axial motion ) degrees of freedom of the same particle .",
    "the error introduced by neglecting these terms is estimated in the appendix .",
    "the remaining term in hamiltonian ( [ hc5 ] ) transforms into @xmath64 from eq .",
    "( [ hxij ] ) we see that the unitary transformation produces the term @xmath65 which represents a direct coupling between the spin motion of different particles .",
    "also in this case , there are additional terms in expression ( [ hxij ] ) , that couple the spin of an electron to the cyclotron motion of the other electrons in the chain . in comparison with the spin - cyclotron interaction for the same particle [",
    "( [ h_nc_rwa ] ) ] , this coupling is reduced of a factor @xmath66 , which , in the range of the parameters considered here , is typically much less than one . for an estimate of the errors introduced by these terms",
    "we refer to the appendix .",
    "hence , summarizing the results of our derivation , we have an effective spin - spin coupling between the electrons with the spatial dynamics substantially decoupled from the spin dynamics .",
    "consequently the spin part of the system hamiltonian can be written , in the case of a linear array of electrons along the @xmath2 axis , as @xmath67 where @xmath68 in eq .",
    "( [ jxy_bis ] ) we used the relations @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we obtain a spin - spin interaction that is antiferromagnetic ( ferromagnetic ) if it is transmitted by the cyclotron ( axial ) motion .",
    "the situation is completely different when the linear array of electrons is aligned along the @xmath3 axis @xmath71 in this case , the sign of the heisenberg like coupling is reversed .",
    "the ferromagnetic ( antiferromagnetic ) interaction is associated to the cyclotron ( axial ) motion .",
    "similar results were also found in the case of ions , in a paul trap , driven by six counterpropagating laser beams @xcite .",

    "the remarkable fact is that this quantum information transfer is realized only by means of the free dynamical evolution of the system , without requiring any external action by the experimenter during the transfer .",
    "therefore , let us analyze the potentialities of our system as a quantum communication channel . in our scheme , the dependence of the spin - spin coupling strength on the system parameters is shown in eqs .",

    "more specifically , the value of @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) depends on the cyclotron ( axial ) frequency @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) . as a consequence of this fact we can neglect @xmath75 with respect to @xmath76 when the value of the ratio @xmath79 is sufficiently large , as in the case considered in @xcite .",
    "differently , in this paper , we choose smaller values for the ratio @xmath79 ( generally about @xmath80 or less ) , so that @xmath75 is of the same order of magnitude of @xmath76 or even larger .",
    "indeed , one can easily check , from eqs .",
    "( [ jz ] ) and ( [ jxy_bis ] ) , that when @xmath81  @xmath82 it is possible to obtain an isotropic heisenberg - like interaction with @xmath83 .",
    "generally the time required to transfer a qubit , encoded in the spin state , along a heisenberg chain depends on the values of @xmath73 , so that the larger the value of @xmath73 the faster the transfer .",
    "indeed , the state transfer time @xmath84 in a heisenberg chain , consisting of just two spins , is equal to @xmath85 we assume that the particles in our linear array are equally spaced with @xmath86 and @xmath87 . from eq .",
    "( [ jxy_bis ] ) we see that @xmath88 . hence , to speed up the transfer process we have to miniaturize the system , to increase the strength of the magnetic field gradient and to reduce the cyclotron frequency",
    ". however , the value of the cyclotron frequency @xmath77 , depending on the confining magnetic field , can not be decreased at will , since it should be sufficiently large to cool the cyclotron motion to its ground state .",
    "for example , at the trap temperature of @xmath89  mk @xcite it is sufficient a cyclotron frequency of the order of @xmath90  ghz .",
    "the inter - particle distance @xmath91 depends on the level of miniaturization of the trap .",
