    "a long - standing question of microscopic description of nuclear collective motion belongs to the class of problems which are left behind by the advancing army that currently is mostly interested in new frontiers , in our case , in drip line physics .",
    "meanwhile , we still lack a systematic theory based on first principles and inter - nucleon interactions that would allow us to fully understand numerous collective phenomena in the low - energy region of medium and heavy nuclei and satisfactorily describe the data . in relatively light nuclei , the shell model ( what is nowadays called configuration interaction ) with effective nucleon - nucleon forces usually works well although even here the abundant numerical results sometimes require some kind of model interpretation . in heavier nuclei ,",
    "the necessary orbital space is too large for direct numerical diagonalization .",
    "phenomenological models frequently work well , first of all the geometric bohr hamiltonian @xcite and the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite . however , the relation between their parameters and the underlying microscopic structure remains uncertain .",
    "moreover , some assumptions of such models turn out to be unreliable . for example , the identification in the ibm of the prescribed boson number with the number of valence fermionic pairs breaks down in the attempt to explain very long  quasivibrational \" bands extended , without considerable changes in spacing , up to spin values much greater than the finite boson number would allow , see for example the ground state band in @xmath0cd close to the equidistant ladder up to @xmath1 .",
    "the microscopic theory is relatively successful in well deformed nuclei .",
    "various mean - field methods , including the modern energy density functional approach @xcite with pairing , indicate regions of nuclei with clearly pronounced deformed energy minima . with the microscopic definition of shape",
    ", one can calculate the moment of inertia by the cranking model and the generator coordinate method , construct rotational bands built on different intrinsic configurations and explain back - bending and similar phenomena @xcite .    in our opinion",
    ", the status of microscopic theory is still underdeveloped with respect to spherical nuclei , especially in the case of the presence of a low - lying collective mode .",
    "the standard way of defining such modes is based on the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) .",
    "this is essentially the harmonic approximation that determines the frequency and two - quasiparticle structure of the collective phonons .",
    "if the multipole coupling is strong , the collective mode has a large amplitude , the frequency falls down , and the qrpa reveals the instability .",
    "in reality , this is not necessarily a point of phase transition . rather , this is the region of strong anharmonicities outside of the reach of the qrpa .",
    "phenomenologically , this can be described by a special choice of potential and rotational parameters in the bohr hamiltonian which are close to the @xmath2 limit of the ibm with a gamma - unstable potential .",
    "currently we do not have a reliable microscopic approach to quantify collective behavior of this type .",
    "another practically important question related to anharmonicities is the mode - mode coupling .",
    "the coexistence and interaction of soft quadrupole and octupole modes are relevant , for example , to the search of mechanisms for many - body enhancement of the nuclear schiff moment and the atomic electric dipole moment @xcite .    instead of the direct diagonalization of the primary nucleon hamiltonian",
    ", it seems reasonable to work out a procedure for the microscopic derivation of the effective collective hamiltonian .",
    "typical collective states can usually be identified by their quantum numbers , low energies and large transition probabilities .",
    "being interconnected by large matrix elements of corresponding collective operators they form a collective subspace of the total hilbert space of the system . in the case of a soft multipole mode ,",
    "it is often possible to label the empirical levels by the phonon quantum numbers , even if their energies and transition rates noticeably differ from the predictions of the harmonic approximation .",
    "this difference results from anharmonic effects which still keep the geometric nature of the mode .",
    "therefore our approach will be to develop the road to a consistent mapping of the underlying nucleonic dynamics onto that inside the collective subspace .",
    "the idea of this approach goes back to the boson expansion technique suggested long ago @xcite ; a detailed review of work in this direction can be found in @xcite .",
    "the formalism of the generalized density matrix ( gdm ) reformulating earlier work @xcite by kerman and klein seems to be the most appropriate for our goal @xcite .",
    "this formalism was applied to collective rotation @xcite and large amplitude collective motion @xcite generalizing the time - dependent mean - field method @xcite .",
    "here we apply the gdm approach to collective vibrations in soft spherical nuclei .",
    "the generalized density matrix @xmath3 is the set of operators defined originally in the entire hilbert space [ _ 1 _ and _ 2 _ here represent a complete set of single - particle ( s.p . ) quantum numbers ] .",
    "the microscopic hamiltonian provides exact operator equations of motion ( e.o.m . ) for this set .",
    "taking matrix elements of these equations between the states of the collective family we map the equations onto the dynamics of the collective operators inside this family .",
    "the choice of the collective hamiltonian should be quite general dictated by the type and symmetries of collective motion under study .",
    "comparison with microscopic dynamics determines the collective parameters .",
    "the lowest orders give naturally the mean field [ hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) equation ] and the harmonic part ( qrpa ) .",
    "next orders determine anharmonicities .",
    "these higher order terms are not assumed to be perturbative , they are separated only by their operator structure in the collective space .",
    "simple estimates @xcite show that in many generic cases the quartic anharmonicity with respect to the quadrupole coordinate plays an important role .",
    "in fact , this was earlier confirmed by specific realistic applications @xcite of the phenomenological anharmonic hamiltonian ; @xmath4pd is probably the clean example of such dynamics .",
