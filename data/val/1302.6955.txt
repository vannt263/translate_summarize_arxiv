    "one of the major challenges in nuclear physics is to understand the interactions among hadrons from first principles . for more than twenty years",
    ", many research groups have directed their efforts to develop effective field theories ( eft ) , working with the idea of separating the nuclear force in long - range and short - range components .",
    "the underlying premise was that low - energy processes , as the ones encountered in nuclear physics , should not be affected by the specific details of the high - energy physics .",
    "the typical energies associated to nuclear phenomena suggest that the appropriate degrees of freedom are nucleons and pions ( or the ground state baryon and pseudo scalar octets for processes involving strangeness ) , interacting derivatively as it is dictated by the effective chiral lagrangian .",
    "the nuclear interaction is characterized by the presence of very different scales , going from the values of the masses of the light pseudo - scalar bosons to the ones of the ground - state octet baryons .",
    "the eft formalism makes use of this separation of scales to construct an expansion of the lagrangian in terms of a parameter built up from ratios of these scales .",
    "for example , in the study of the low - energy nucleon - nucleon interaction , a clear separation of scales is seen between the external momentum of the interacting nucleons , a soft scale which typically takes values up to the pion mass , and a hard scale corresponding to the nucleon mass . while the long - range part of this interaction is governed by the light scale through the pion - exchange mechanism ,",
    "short - range forces are accounted for by zero - range contact operators , organized according to an increasing number of derivatives .",
    "these contact terms , which respect chiral symmetry , have values which are not constrained by the chiral lagrangian , and therefore , their relative strength ( encapsulated in the size of the low - energy coefficients , lecs ) has to be obtained from a fit to nuclear observables .",
    "the large amount of experimental data for the interaction among pions and nucleons has made possible to perform successful eft calculations of the strong nucleon - nucleon interaction up to fourth order in the momentum expansion ( @xmath1 ) , at next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order ( n@xmath2lo ) in the heavy - baryon formalism  @xcite . in the weak sector , the study of nucleon - nucleon parity violation ( pv ) with an effective field theory at leading order has been undertaken in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors discuss existing and possible few - body measurements that can help in constraining the relevant ( five ) low - energy constants at order @xmath3 in the momentum expansion and the ones associated with dynamical pions .    in the strange sector ,",
    "the experimental situation is less favorable due to the short life - time of hyperons , unstable against the weak interaction .",
    "this fact complicates the extraction of information regarding the strong interaction among baryons in free space away from the nucleonic sector .",
    "nevertheless , su(3 ) extensions of the eft for nucleons and pions have been developed at leading order ( lo )  @xcite and next - to - leading ( nlo ) order  @xcite . in the present work we consider the weak four - body @xmath4 interaction , which is accessible experimentally by looking at the decay of @xmath5hypernuclei , bound systems composed by nucleons and one @xmath6 hyperon .",
    "these aggregates decay weakly through mesonic ( @xmath7 ) and non - mesonic ( @xmath4 ) modes , the former being suppressed for mass numbers of the order or larger than 5 , due to the pauli blocking effect acting on the outgoing nucleon .",
    "in contrast to the weak nn pv interaction , which is masked by the much stronger parity conserving ( pc ) strong nn signal , the weak @xmath8 interaction has the advantage of presenting a change of flavor as a signature , favoring its detection in the presence of the strong interaction .",
    "the first studies of the weak @xmath9 interaction using a lowest order effective theory were presented in refs .",
    "these works included the exchange of the lighter pseudoscalar mesons while parametrizing the short - range part of the interaction with contact terms at order @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the momentum exchanged between the interacting baryons . while the results of ref .",
    "@xcite show that it is possible to reproduce the hypernuclear decay data with the lowest order effective lagrangian , the stability of the momentum expansion has to be checked by including the next order in the eft .",
    "if an effective field theory can be built for the weak @xmath4 transition , the values for the lecs of the theory , which encode the high - energy components of the interaction , should vary within a reasonable and natural range when one includes higher orders in the calculation .",
    "compared to the lo calculation , which involves two lecs , the unknown baryon - baryon - kaon vertices and the pseudoscalar cut - off parameter in the form - factor , the nlo calculation introduces additional unknowns .",
    "namely , the parameters associated to the new contact terms ( three when one neglects the small value of the momentum of the initial particles , a nucleon and a hyperon bound in the hypernucleus , in front of the momentum of the two outgoing nucleons ) and the couplings appearing in the two - pion exchange diagrams .",
    "therefore , in order to constrain the eft at nlo , one needs to collect enough data , either through the accurate measure of hypernuclear decay observables , or through the measure of the inverse reaction in free space , @xmath12 .",
    "unfortunately , the small values of the cross - sections for the weak strangeness production mechanism , of the order of @xmath13 mb  @xcite , has prevented , for the time being , its consideration as part of the experimental data set , despite the effort invested in extracting different polarization observables for this process  @xcite . at present , quantitative experimental information on",
    "the @xmath14 weak interaction in the baryonic sector comes from the measure of the total and partial decay rates of hypernuclei , and an asymmetry in the number of protons detected parallel and antiparallel to the polarization axis , which comes from the interference between the pc and pv weak amplitudes .",
    "since observables from one hypernucleus to another can be related through hypernuclear structure coefficients , one has to be careful in selecting the data that can be used in the eft calculation .",
    "for example , while one may indeed expect measurements from different p - shell hypernuclei , say , a=12 and 16 , to provide with the same constraint , the situation is different when including data from s - shell hypernuclei like a=5 . for the latter",
    ", the initial @xmath9 pair can only be in a relative s - state , while for the former , relative p - states are allowed as well . in this paper",
    "we present the analytic expressions to be included at next - to - leading order in the effective theory for the weak @xmath9 interaction .",
    "these expressions have been derived by considering four - fermion contact terms with a derivative operator insertion together with the two - pion exchange mechanism .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the lagrangians and the power counting scheme we use to calculate the relevant feynman diagrams . in sections",
    "[ ss : loc ] and [ ss : nloc ] we present the lo and nlo potentials for the @xmath15 transition , and a comparison between both contributions is performed in section [ sec : bc ] .",
    "we conclude and summarize in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the non - mesonic weak decay of the @xmath6 involves both the strong and electroweak interactions .",
    "the @xmath6 decay is mediated by the presence of a nucleon which in the simplest meson - exchange picture , exchanges a meson , e.g. @xmath16 , @xmath17 , with the @xmath6 .",
    "thus , computing the transition requires the knowledge of the strong and weak lagrangians involving all the hadrons entering in the process . in this section",

    "nevertheless , the stability of the eft approach which has to be tested by looking at higher orders in the theory , could not be analyzed yet , mainly because of the very scarce world - database for such observables , a situation which should be improved in the near future .    in this article",
    "we have presented the one - loop contribution to the previously obtained lo eft for the weak @xmath106 @xmath9 transition .    as expected , the structure of the transition amplitude is considerably more involved than the corresponding lo amplitude and contains more low - energy coefficients which ought to be fitted to data . in the present formal work we have solely presented the calculation of the amplitude terms and have not attempted to make any comparison to experimental data , therefore ,",
    "no fit in order to extract the new unknowns has been performed .",
    "the different structures which appear in the obtained transition amplitude , involving spin , isospin and orbital degrees of freedom , produce sizable contributions to all relevant partial waves .",
    "to illustrate this fact , we have presented the potential in @xmath107 space corresponding to the different feynman diagrams for the @xmath108 partial wave .",
    "box and cross - box diagrams are found to produce substantial contributions at distances of the order of 1 fm , larger than the ones corresponding to the one - pion - exchange and one - kaon - exchange mechanisms . in view of this result",
    ", it would be interesting to see if one - loop contributions play an equivalent role in other partial wave transitions , testing possible cancellations or enhancements that would leave the results for the decay rates either unchanged or modified .",
    "a complete analysis of the higher order terms would require a larger set of independent hypernuclear decay measurements and a more accurate measure of some observables , specially those related to the parity violating asymmetry for s - shell and p - shell hypernuclei .",
    "moreover , it would be desirable to arrange for alternative experiments focused to obtain information on the weak @xmath106 interaction .",

    "unfortunately , the small value for the cross - section for this process precluded the compilation of new data .",
