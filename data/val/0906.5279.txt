    "the exponential growth of the state space with @xmath1 imposes a severe burden on resources for this type of simulation .",
    "finding classes of quantum computations that can be simulated efficiently is an active field of research  @xcite .    in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the qubits that comprise a composite system remain accessible , and it is through interactions with individual and pairs of qubits that computation is implemented .",
    "for example , a single - qubit transformation affects all @xmath0 computational basis states of an @xmath1-qubit system .",
    "it therefore seems that one of the features of quantum systems that enables more efficient computing is the ability to harness the degrees of freedom of a @xmath0d vector space by interacting with only @xmath1 qubits .",
    "here we present a classical model of discrete quantum systems that is based on representing individual qubits and transformations applied to them .",
    "this enables us to address specific qubits in a composite system , the state of which is represented as a complex function of a single variable , and thereby directly replicate the steps in an algorithm as they would be implemented in a quantum system . while the resources required to carry out a computation exactly are comparable to other methods , this model may be compatible with new approximations that would enable simulating more qubits than currently is feasible .",
    "furthermore , the approach of building a classical model based on imitating quantum systems could offer an opportunity to gain insight into the difference in computational power of classical and quantum architectures .",

    "uncoupled qubits , the state of the composite system is given by the tensor product of the individual states , and the number of computational basis states grows exponentially with the number of qubits .",
    "for example , the state of an @xmath1-qubit system , with each qubit in an equal superposition of computational basis states @xmath3 and @xmath4 , is given by the state vector , @xmath5 application of a unitary operation to a qubit that is part of a composite system , which constitutes a step in an algorithm , affects all states in the superposition simultaneously , illustrating the massive parallelism inherent in quantum computation .",
    "any quantum algorithm can be approximated arbitrarily closely using just single qubit operations and a generic two - qubit interaction , such as the controlled - not ( cnot ) gate  @xcite .",

    "realizable quantum computation relies on the ability to diminish the effects of these errors  quantum error correction and fault - tolerant quantum computation exploit entanglement and the discrete nature of quantum systems to make this possible .",

    "the function representing a qubit can be replaced with one or the other basis function according to these probabilities in order to represent the measurement process . the ability to determine both measurement probabilities for a given state",
    "eliminates the need to introduce and carry along normalization coefficients  the relative probabilities can be determined at the time of measurement .",
    "this model can be extended to composite systems by using a different frequency for the basis functions for each two - state system , creating a new 2d vector space for each qubit .",
    "the mapping of quantum states to functions for composite systems becomes @xmath18 refers to the @xmath19th qubit and @xmath1 is the total number in the system .    if @xmath1 single - qubit functions in equal superpositions are multiplied , the result is a linear combination of @xmath0 different products , @xmath20 this is analogous to the tensor - product state for a composite quantum system in eq .",

    "the fourier frequencies for these terms are also multiples of @xmath42the fundamental frequency is the greatest common divisor of the set of all qubit frequencies , and necessarily divides any subset of them .",
    "these terms therefore also vanish when integrated over an interval of @xmath46 .    finally , the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ e.ortho ] ) can have a term of unity ( times @xmath47 ) .",

    "_ i.e. _ @xmath49 .",
    "this argument is only valid if all of the fourier frequencies @xmath32 are unique .",

    ", these factors will be expressions involving other qubit basis functions .",
    "once isolated , they can be multiplied by the transformed basis functions and these recombined to generate the transformed composite function .",
    "consider a general @xmath59 , similar to eq .",
    "( [ e.multi-c-bit ] ) but with arbitrary coefficients for the @xmath26 .",

''    for small @xmath1 , a procedure similar to the one for a single qubit can be adapted .",

    "<S> individual qubits remain accessible in a composite system , which is represented as a complex function of a single variable , though entanglement imposes a demand on resources that scales exponentially with the number of entangled qubits . </S>",
