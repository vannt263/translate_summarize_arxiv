    "eruptive young stellar objects ( ysos ) are characterized by dramatically increased accretion from the circumstellar disk onto the star @xcite .",

    "* ) type stars , observations of the past decades revealed several embedded eruptive young stars whose classification is uncertain , and differ from both classical types in amplitude and time scale @xcite .",
    "although the outbursts in each class are powered by enhanced accretion from the disk onto the star , the spectroscopic properties of fuors and exors are radically different .",
    "exors keep the major spectroscopic signatures of magnetospheric accretion during the outburst , whereas fuor spectra indicate star ",
    "disk interaction zones substantially transformed by the outburst .",
    "the powerful winds , associated with the high accretion rate , produce herbig  haro ( hh ) objects , which may thus be important tracers of the accretion history @xcite .",
    "since a sizeable part of the stellar mass may build up during repeated outbursts @xcite , and the high accretion luminosity and associated outflows affect the structure and evolution of the protoplanetary disks , outbursting stars are key objects for understanding the formation of sun - like stars and their planetary systems . their extreme rarity and diversity , however , hinder the understanding of the origin and nature of the outbursts .",
    "the recent review by @xcite lists 26 fuors and fuor - like objects , and 18 exors can be found in the list of @xcite .",
    "new discoveries and their subsequent monitoring are thus relevant to a better understanding of the phenomenon of episodic accretion .",
    "the new candidate eruptive stars presented in this letter are found in lynds  1340 , an isolated dark cloud at ( _ l , b _ ) = ( 130.1,11.5 ) .",
    "the first large - scale studies of the region @xcite suggested that l1340 , located at 600pc from the sun , has formed a few mid - b , a and early f type , and some two dozens of low - mass stars .",
    "we conducted a comprehensive multi - wavelength study of l1340 , involving _ spitzer _ , _ wise _ , _ 2mass _ , and _ sdss _ photometric data , a search for  emission stars via slitless grism spectroscopy , long - slit optical spectroscopy , narrow - band optical and high angular resolution near infrared imaging observations ( m. kun et al .",

    "this work led to a revised distance of @xmath4pc for l1340 , and resulted in the discovery of some 250 candidate ysos . among them",

    "one of them is iras  02224 + 7227 , identified by @xcite as the probable exciting source of hh  487 , situated at 6.2  southwest of the star .",
    "the two others are 2mass  02263797 + 7304575 and 2mass  02325605 + 7246055 , neither of them was mentioned before as a young star .",

    "the south - western part of l1340 is outside the field of view of the 24 and 70  images .",
    "we performed aperture photometry on individual saturation corrected basic calibrated data ( cbcd ) irac images , produced by the s18.18.0 pipeline at the spitzer science center ( ssc ) , using a 2-pixel aperture radius , and a sky annulus between 2 and 6 pixels . an additional array - dependent photometric correction and a pixel - phase correction",

    "the final photometry and its uncertainty were estimated as the average and rms of the individual flux densities measured in different cbcd frames . for mips data we used mopex @xcite to create mosaic maps from the 24  enhanced bcd and 70  bcd products ( version s18.13.0 ) of ssc . following @xcite at 70   before mosaicing we made a column",

    "we estimated the spectral type , extinction , and luminosity of the star by comparing the short - wavelength ( _ bvrij _ ) side of the low - state sed with a grid of reddened photospheres , using the pre - main sequence colors and bolometric corrections tabulated by @xcite and the extinction law of @xcite , as well as the @xmath23mag ( foreground extinction toward l1340 , * ? ? ?",

    "detection of such events may be helpful in looking for the specialities of exor disks , distinguishing them from those of less violent pre - main sequence stars .",
    "such specialities may be the high @xmath30 , and the flattening of the sed between 24 and 70 , unlike typical t  tauri seds , and indicative of a remnant infalling envelope @xcite .",
    "a similar flattening can be seen in the sed of prototype exor , ex lupi @xcite , and the candidate exors identified by @xcite also exhibit flat seds near the classi / classii boundary , indicating that eruptive events occur at the earliest evolutionary phases of the protoplanetary disks .",
    "this star is invisible in the dss1 red image .",
