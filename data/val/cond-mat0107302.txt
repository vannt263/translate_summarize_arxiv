    "an understanding of quantum magnetism is important for a large number of phenomena in physics .",
    "three well - known examples are high - temperature superconductivity , quantum phase transitions and the quantum hall effect .",
    "moreover , it appears that magnetic properties are also very important in another area , namely bose - einstein condensation in trapped atomic gases .",
    "this has come about because of two independent experimental developments .",
    "the first development is the realization of an optical trap for atoms , whose operation no longer requires the gas to be doubly spin - polarized @xcite . the second development is the creation of a two - component bose - einstein condensate @xcite , which by means of rf - fields can be manipulated so as to make the two components essentially equivalent @xcite . as a result",
    "the behavior of both spin-1 and spin-1/2 bose gases can now be experimentally explored in detail .",
    "indeed , at present already such diverse phenomena as domain walls @xcite , macroscopic quantum tunneling @xcite , rabi oscillations and vortices @xcite have been observed .",
    "theoretically , the ground - state structure of these gases has recently been worked out by a number of authors @xcite and also the first studies of the line - like vortex excitations have appeared @xcite .",
    "however , an immediate question that comes to mind is whether the spin degrees of freedom allow for other topological excitations that do not have an analogy in the case of a single component or scalar bose condensate .",
    "it is one of the aims of this paper to show that the answer to this question is in general affirmative . in particular , we show that a ferromagnetic bose - einstein condensate has so - called skyrmion excitations , which are nonsingular but nevertheless topologically nontrivial point - like spin textures . roughly speaking",
    ", the skyrmion is an excitation that can be created out of the ground state , in which all the spins are aligned , by reversing the average spin in a finite region of space .",
    "skyrmions are also known from nuclear physics @xcite and the quantum hall effect @xcite , but to observe them in an atomic gas would be exciting since in that case a completely microscopic understanding of their behavior is possible . in nuclear physics and the quantum hall effect",
    "this is not true because of the nonperturbative nature of qcd and the presence of impurities that obstruct the center - of - mass motion of the skyrmions , respectively .",
    "having proven their existence , we then turn to the investigation of the precise texture , the energetic stability , and finally the dynamical behavior of skyrmions .",
    "some of the results of this analysis we have already reported in previous communications @xcite , but here we try to give a much more complete and detailed picture of the skyrmion physics in spinor bose - einstein condensates .    with this in mind , we would like to mention that we recently have also considered t hooft - polyakov monopoles @xcite in an antiferromagnetic bose - einstein condensate @xcite .",
    "these topological excitations are in fact singular skyrmions , but have quite different properties than the nonsingular skyrmions which are the object of study in this paper . in particular , due to the singular nature of the spin texture of the t hooft - polyakov monopole , the condensate density vanishes in the core and the monopole turns out to be thermodynamically stable .",
    "this is completely analogous to the case of a vortex in a scalar bose - einstein condensate .",
    "both these features are not shared by the nonsingular skyrmions , which complicates the analysis considerably .",
    "the most important problem in this respect is that for a nonsingular skyrmion the topology allows for a spin texture with an arbitrary intrinsic size . as a result",
    "the stability of the skyrmion is now determined by energetic arguments and not by topological arguments as in the case of the singular t hooft - polyakov monopole .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec . [ defining ]",
    ", we use the symmetry properties of the order parameter of a spinor bose - einstein condensate to show that quite generally skyrmion excitations indeed exist in such a condensate .",
    "we then turn our attention to the ferromagnetic case and discuss some general properties of these topological excitations , especially the spin texture , the superfluid velocity profile , and also the density profile . in sec .",
    "[ stability ] we investigate the energetic stability of the skyrmion and show that from a thermodynamic point of view they are always unstable and tend to shrink to microscopic sizes . as a result",
    "we then consider the dynamical stability of the skyrmion and in particular determine the rate at which they collapse .",
    "we find that under certain conditions this rate is actually much smaller than the decay rate of the condensate itself due to various inelastic processes .",
    "therefore , the skyrmion can for all practical purposes be considered as a ( meta)stable excitation and we are justified to look in sec .",
    "[ dynamicproperties ] also at other important dynamic properties of the skyrmion such as the `` spin '' and the center - of - mass motion .",
    "finally , we end in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] by a summary and some conclusions .",
    "in this section we discuss in detail the main static features of skyrmions .",
    "first of all , we show from the symmetry of the order - parameter space of the spinor condensate , that from a topological point of view point - like skyrmion excitations can indeed exist in both spin-1/2 and spin-1 bose - einstein condensates . focussing then on the ferromagnetic case",
    ", we introduce a convenient parameterization of the skyrmion texture , which allows us to incorporate most easily the nontrivial winding number associated with the skyrmion .",
    "next , we write down the energy functional for a ferromagnetic spinor condensate and , by substituting the above mentioned parametrization , derive the corresponding euler - lagrange equations for the density profile and the spin texture of the skyrmion . finally , to simplify the actual calculation of the skyrmion density profile and the spin texture , we propose a variational approach that automatically takes into account the desired overall features of the skyrmion texture .      to find all possible topological excitations of a spinor condensate",
    ", we need to know the full symmetry of the macroscopic wave function @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the total density of the gas , @xmath2 is a normalized spinor that determines the average local spin by means of @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are the usual spin matrices obeying the commutation relations @xmath5",
    "= i \\epsilon_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma } s_{\\gamma}$ ] . note that here , and in the following , summation over repeated indices is always implicitly implied . from the work of ho @xcite we know that in the case of spin-1 bosons we have to consider two possibilities , since the effective interaction between two spins can be either antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic . in the antiferromagnetic case",
    "the ground - state energy is minimized for @xmath6 , which implies that the parameter space for the spinor @xmath2 is only @xmath7 because we are free to choose both its overall phase and the spin quantization axis . in the ferromagnetic case",
    "the energy is minimized for @xmath8 and the parameter space corresponds to the full rotation group @xmath9 . using the same arguments , we find that for spin-1/2 bosons the order - parameter space of the ground state is always equivalent to @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "what do these results tell us about the possible topological excitations @xcite ?",
    "for line - like defects or vortices , we can assume @xmath2 to be independent of one direction and the spinor represents a mapping from a two - dimensional plane into the order - parameter space .",
    "if the vortex is singular this will be visible on the boundary of the two - dimensional plane and we need to investigate the properties of a continuous mapping from a circle @xmath11 into the order - parameter space @xmath12 , i.e. , of the first homotopy group @xmath13 . since @xmath14 and @xmath15 , we conclude that a spin-1/2 and a ferromagnetic spin-1 condensate can have only vortices with a winding number equal to 1 , whereas an antiferromagnetic spin-1 condensate can have vortices with winding numbers that are an arbitrary integer .",
    "physically , this means that by traversing the boundary of the plane , the spinor can wind around the order - parameter at most once or an arbitrary number of times , respectively .",
    "this conclusion is identical to the one obtained previously by ho @xcite .",
    "if the vortex is nonsingular , however , the spinor @xmath2 will be identical everywhere on the boundary of the two - dimensional plane and it effectively represents a mapping from the surface of a three - dimensional sphere @xmath16 into the order parameter space .",
    "we then need to consider the second homotopy group @xmath17 .",
    "for this we have that @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "hence nonsingular or coreless vortices are only possible for a spin-1 condensate with antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "it therefore appears that the nonsingular spin texture discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , is topologically unstable and can be continuously deformed into the ground state by `` local surgery '' @xcite .",
    "we are now in a position to discuss point - like defects .",
    "since the boundary of a three - dimensional gas is also the surface of a three - dimensional sphere , singular point - like defects are also determined by the second homotopy group @xmath17 .",
    "such topological excitations thus only exist in the case of a spin-1 bose gas with antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "we call these excitations t hooft and polyakov monopoles @xcite , although it would be justifiable to call them singular skyrmions . for nonsingular point - like defects the spinor @xmath2 will again be identical on the boundary of the three - dimensional gas . as a result ,",
    "the configurations space is compactified to the surface of a four - dimensional sphere @xmath20 and we need to determine the third homotopy group @xmath21 .",
    "for this we find @xmath22 .",
    "hence nonsingular skyrmion excitations exist in all three cases .",
    "we consider from now on only the case of a homogeneous and ferromagnetic spinor condensate . in the ground state",
    "all spins are aligned along the direction of a uniform and sufficiently weak magnetic field , which we take to be along the @xmath23-axis .",
    "the uniform magnetic field is needed only to direct the spins in the ground state , but it should not provide a substantial energy barrier for spin flips .",
    "the fact that we consider a homogeneous gas and not a confined one is only for simplicity and turns out not to be crucial for the practical applicability of our work .",
    "this is so because the , for our purposes relevant length scale over which the skyrmion spin deformations take place is always of the order of the correlation length , which under typical experimental conditions is much less than the length scale for density gradients due to the confining potential .",
    "the skyrmion excitation is a space - dependent spin deformation of the ground state and can thus be represented by a position - dependent spinor @xmath2 .",
    "a convenient way of introducing the position - dependence in the spinor is to write it in terms of a position - dependent rotation that acts on the constant spinor @xmath24 associated with the ferromagnetic groundstate . in this manner",
    "we have @xmath25 here , the constant spinor @xmath24 minimizes the zeeman energy and is given by @xmath26 in the usual basis that diagonalizes @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath28 is a real vector function of @xmath29 .",
    "it parametrizes the ferromagnetic order - parameter space , which due to our incorporation of the factor @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ spinor ] ) is always a sphere of radius @xmath31 .",
    "we point out that here and throughout the following @xmath32 can only take the values 1/2 or 1 . the significance of eq .",
    "( [ spinor ] ) is that at a point @xmath29 the spinor @xmath24 is rotated by an angle that equals @xmath33 around the direction of @xmath28 .",
    "there is no restriction on the generality of spin textures produced by this means ; it is merely a convenient parameterization of the order - parameter space in terms of @xmath28 .",
    "since we are mostly interested in the equilibrium properties , we assume here for simplicity the maximally symmetric shape of the skyrmion which is expected to have the smallest possible gradients .",
    "this means that we take @xmath34 where the function @xmath35 should obey the boundary conditions @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "thus , at these boundaries the rotation operator in eq .",
    "( [ spinor ] ) becomes the identity and gives rise to @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath35 should as a function of radius decrease monotonocally from @xmath39 to 0 , since this will correspond to the smallest gradient energy for the spin deformations . with this ansatz for @xmath40 and its boundary conditions",
    ", we see that by traversing the whole configuration space , we exactly cover the order - parameter space twice , which is required to avoid a singular behavior of the spinor at @xmath41 . indeed , the boundary condition @xmath42 , which in first instance appears to be the right one as it leads to a spin texture which covers the order - parameter space only once , is physically unacceptable because it results in a singular behaviour of the spinor @xmath2 and therefore in divergencies in the gradient energy .",
    "the reason for this singular behaviour is that , given the maximally symmetric shape of the skyrmion , the spinor @xmath2 is always equal to @xmath24 on the @xmath23-axis .",
    "note that apart from topological reasons , the condition @xmath37 also ensures that the spin deformations associated with the skyrmion have a finite range , so that only a finite amount of energy is required to excite the skyrmion from the ground state .",
    "thus , both on the @xmath23-axis and far away from the center of the skyrmion the spins are directed as in the ground state . from these general features we can now draw a qualitative picture of the skyrmion texture .",
    "suppose we approach the origin along a line through the origin , starting from a distance much larger than the range of the spin deformations .",
    "then how does the average local spin behave as a function of distance ? according to the above description of the rotation operator depicted in fig .",
    "[ schematic ] , the spin initially points up along the @xmath23-axis , but by approaching the origin it will start to rotate around the radial direction until we approach the origin and the spin points up again .",
    "it is essential that the spins complete an integer number of cycles equal to @xmath30 in order to have a nonzero topological winding number given by @xmath43 which in this case is equal to 1 .    summarizing ,",
    "we have obtained the desired position dependence of @xmath2 in terms of a single function @xmath35 that describes how the average local spin vector is tilted from its orientation in the ground state .",
    "this function and the local density @xmath1 represent the two degrees of freedom that describe the skyrmion and our next task is to determine their precise spacial dependence .      for a ferromagnetic spinor condensate , ho @xcite",
    "has shown that , within the mean - field approach , the energy functional in the absence of a magnetic field is given by @xmath44&\\equiv&\\int d{\\bf r}\\left [ { \\hbar^2\\over 2m}\\left(\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\nabla$}{\\sqrt{n({\\bf r})}}\\right)^2 -\\mu n({\\bf r})\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left.{\\hbar^2\\over 2m}n({\\bf r})|\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\nabla$ } \\zeta ( { \\bf   r})|^2 + { 1\\over2}t^{2b}n^2({\\bf r})\\right ] \\label{functional},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the mass of the atoms , @xmath46 is their chemical potential and @xmath47 is the appropriate coupling constant that represents the strength of the interatomic interactions in terms of the positive scattering length @xmath48 .",
    "the term @xmath49 represents the energy density associated with the gradients in the spin texture .",
    "it is this term that enforces the boundary condition @xmath36 , as discussed previously .    for sufficiently large distances",
    "the gradient terms vanish and we infer from eq .",
    "( [ functional ] ) that @xmath50 , where @xmath51 . using this , eq .",
    "( [ functional ] ) can be put in a dimensionless form by scaling the lengths to the correlation length @xmath52 , the density to @xmath53 , and the total energy to @xmath54 . in this manner",

    "the gradient term @xmath58 is calculated in appendix [ a ] explicitly as a function of @xmath59 .",

    "finally , the density profile @xmath63 and the function @xmath59 can be determined from the two coupled differential equations resulting from minimizing @xmath64 $ ] with respect to @xmath63 and @xmath59 , namely @xmath65 and @xmath66=0 \\label{omegaequation},\\ ] ] where @xmath67 and @xmath68 in the spin-1 case , eqs .",
    "( [ gradzeta2 ] ) and ( [ gp ] ) show that the density profile is in principle anisotropic . however , the anisotropy turns out to be rather small as we show explicitly in sec .",
    "[ stability ] .      [ profile ] in principle , to calculate the exact skyrmion texture and density profile , we should now solve the two coupled nonlinear differential equations that result from minimizing the energy functional with respect to @xmath63 and @xmath69 , namely eqs .",
    "( [ gp ] ) and ( [ omegaequation ] ) . as an alternative",
    ", we employ here a rather simpler , though less rigorous , approach .",
    "we simplify the calculations by introducing an ansatz for @xmath59 that takes explicitly into account the physical boundary conditions discussed in the previous section .",
    "our ansatz is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a parameter that determines the radius at which @xmath59 crosses over from @xmath39 to 0 and physically corresponds to the size of the skyrmion .",
    "we see that this ansatz automatically satisfies the boundary conditions @xmath36 and @xmath72 , as required .",
    "it should be noted here that the detailed functional behavior of @xmath59 will turn out not to be crucial for our results on the skyrmion stability as long as it satisfies the prescribed boundary conditions and falls of monotonically . to substantiate this remark ,",
    "we have performed also calculations using a number of different forms for @xmath59 that satisfy the desired boundary conditions such as @xmath73 .",
    "we found , as expected , that the skyrmion energy only differs slightly from one function to the other and , in particular , that the energy is minimized for the function given in eq .",
    "( [ omegaansatz ] ) .",
    "furtunately , this ansatz is also simpler to handle analytically .",
    "the most important question about the skyrmion excitation is whether it is energetically stable or not . in other words , how does the energy of the skyrmion depends on its size ? as we show next , the answer to this question is that the skyrmion always tends to shrink to microscopic sizes to minimize its energy .",
    "although this is an unfortunate result , it does not need to rule out an experimental observation of the skyrmion excitation as long as the typical time scale for this collapse is sufficiently long .",
    "therefore , we also consider this problem after we have discussed the thermodynamical stability of the skyrmion .    for sufficiently large skyrmions",
    "the gradients of the spinor @xmath2 are small and density fluctuations are therefore also small .",
    "the energy of the skyrmion can then be approximated by @xmath74 .",
    "if the size of the skyrmion is of order of @xmath71 , this energy scales as @xmath71 .",
    "this indicates that the skyrmion tends to shrink in order to minimize its energy .",
    "however , for smaller sizes the density fluctuations and their gradients start to grow and this simple argument no longer applies . for large skyrmions eq .",
    "( [ gp ] ) shows that the density fluctuations scale as @xmath75 and their energy contribution thus behaves as @xmath76 .",
    "approaching smaller values of @xmath71 , the kinetic energy term in eq .",
    "( [ gp ] ) increases and the density fluctuations will scale with a power of @xmath71 that is greater than @xmath77 , because otherwise the density would become negative at some point . as a result",
    "the energy will scale with a power of @xmath71 that is different from 1 .",
    "therefore , there is in principle a chance for stability if the energy associated with the density fluctuations is at some point increasing when @xmath71 becomes smaller . to investigate this possibility we need to calculate the energy as a function of @xmath71 exactly for all values of @xmath71 .",
    "if the energy function possesses a ( local ) global minimum for a finite @xmath71 , then the skyrmion is energetically ( meta)stable . we have indeed calculated this energy curve , the details can be found in sec .",
    "[ baby ] below , and it turns out that the skyrmion energy actually increases monotonically with @xmath71 .",
    "this means that a skyrmion of any finite size is energetically unstable and will tend to shrink to zero size .",
    "of course , this condition holds within the gross - pitaevskii theory which describes only the long - wavelength physics .",
    "corrections to this theory will lead to a finite , but microscopically small size of the skyrmion .",
    "however , as mentioned previously , for observing the skyrmion experimentally it is important to know the time scale for its collapse since it could be larger than the lifetime of the condensate itself due to various inelastic processes , such as two- and three - body collisions and , in an optical trap , photon absorption .    from our analysis of the skyrmion shrinking rate , it turns out that there are two size regimes with different shrinking mechanisms .",
    "the first is for skyrmions with a size @xmath71 that is much larger than the correlation length of the gas .",
    "we denote such large skyrmions as `` adult '' skyrmions .",
    "the second regime is for much smaller skyrmions with sizes of the order of the correlation length or less .",
    "we denote these small skyrmions as `` baby '' skyrmions . in the next two subsections",
    "we calculate the skyrmion energy and estimate its shrinking rate in these two regimes .",
    "as mentioned earlier , adult skyrmions are large skyrmions with a size @xmath71 that satisfies @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the correlation length of a homogeneous gas of average density @xmath53 and @xmath80-wave interatomic scattering length @xmath48 . in this section",
    "we express the lagrangian of the skyrmion in terms of a time - dependent skyrmion size @xmath81 .",
    "an equation of motion for @xmath81 is then derived .",
    "it should be noted here that comparison between our calculation in this section and experiment is only meaningful for skyrmion sizes much less than the condensate size since this calculation is for a homogeneous system and does not take into account the effect of the trap .",
    "the two conditions thus imply that the spinor condensate is deep in the thomas - fermi regime .    for adult skyrmions",

    "as already mentioned , it leads to a size dependence of the the skyrmion energy such that the skyrmion tends to shrink to zero size . the shrinking process , however , is now fundamentally different and more complicated than that for the adult skyrmions . in this case , while the skyrmion is shrinking the density becomes increasingly depleted in a region that forms a closed shell around the center of the skyrmion .",
    "for sufficiently small @xmath71 the depletion will be so large that the atoms inside the closed shell are essentially isolated from the atoms outside the shell .",
    "this will considerably slow down the collapse of the skyrmion since the atoms within the shell need to tunnel over a potential barrier to escape to the other side of the shell and to enable the skyrmion to shrink further .",

    "[ texturefig ] .",
    "these figures show clearly that the skyrmion corresponds to a torodial region . along the inner radius of the torus ,",
    "the direction of the average spin vectors is opposite to that in the ground state .",
    "an interesting property shows up when we calculate the associated superfluid velocity @xmath158 .",

    "this corresponds to a spiraling motion around the inner radius of the torus .",
    "the speed is maximum in the center of the torus .",
    "furthermore , the maximum depletion of the density takes place at the maximum of @xmath160 , which turns out to be in the center of the torus , where the spin vector is also completely flipped , i.e. , @xmath161 . in the case of a spin-1/2 condensate ,",
    "the spin texture consists of two torii .",
    "the velocity field in this case is such that atoms spiral around the center of one torus clock wise and along the center of the other torus counter clock wise , but for both torii the atoms rotate around the @xmath23-axis in the same direction . the spins are completely flipped along the inner radii of the two torii .",
    "the density is mostly depleted along a radius that is slightly smaller than the inner radius of the larger torus .",
    "the shift is only approximately 3 percent of the size of the skyrmion .",
    "the outcome of the calculation in the previous subsection is the skyrmion density profile as a function of @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , the energy of the skyrmion , determined from eq .",
    "( [ functional ] ) , is now also a function of @xmath71 .",
    "the skyrmion will be energetically stable if this energy @xmath162 $ ] has a local or global minimum and the equilibrium size of the skyrmion will be equal to the value of @xmath71 at that minimum .",
    "it should be noted that what we call the energy of the skyrmion is actually the grand - canonical energy .",
    "this implies that the density profile is solved by using a fixed chemical potential for all values of @xmath71 .",
    "consequently , the number of atoms associated with the skyrmion excitation , which equals @xmath163 , is also @xmath71-dependent .",
    "( the subtracted term is to cancel the divergent part coming from the fact that the system is infinite . in a confined system",
    "there is no need to make this subtraction . )",
    "it may therefore not be immediately clear that minimizing the grand - canonical energy is appropriate . in principle",
    ", we must minimize the true energy of the skyrmion at a fixed number of atoms .",
    "we now explicitly show though , that these procedures are equivalent .",
    "let us take the number of atoms in the system equal to @xmath164 .",
    "this means that in the absence of the skyrmion @xmath165 .",
    "suppose we now put in a skyrmion of size @xmath71 in the condensate without affecting the asymptotic density , i.e. , @xmath166 .",
    "due to the depletion of the density near the center of the skyrmion , the total number of atoms associated with this density profile is slightly less than @xmath164 by an amount @xmath167 .",
    "physically this means that to produce this skyrmion we have to remove @xmath168 atoms to the edge of the spinor condensate .",
    "if we , however , want to produce a skyrmion with the same number of atoms in the condensate , we have to adjust the asymptotic density .",
    "this implies that a reasonable approximation to the density profile is actually @xmath169 because then @xmath170 using this density profile to calculate the true energy of the skyrmion and expanding the various terms in it up to first order in @xmath171 , we reproduce exactly the grand - canonical energy @xmath162 $ ] .",
    "thus , we conclude that minimizing the canonical energy with a fixed number of atoms is indeed equivalent to minimizing the grand - canonical energy at a fixed chemical potential and thus with a changing number of atoms .",
    "the second method is clearly more convenient numerically since it is difficult to keep the number of atoms fixed for each value of @xmath71 .    in fig .",
    "[ energy ] we show our final result of this calculation , where we have taken @xmath1 to be isotropic , since in the previous section we saw that the angular - dependence of @xmath1 can indeed be neglected . in detail , we have plotted here @xmath172-\\mu n(r)-(e[n_{\\infty}]-\\mu n_{\\infty})$ ] against @xmath71 .",
    "again , we subtract the divergent part due to the infiniteness of the system .",
    "unfortunately , both of the two curves do not have a minimum for any finite @xmath71 and only contain a global minimum at @xmath173 .",
    "this means that , according to this figure , the skyrmion is energetically unstable , i.e. , if the skyrmion is created with a finite size it will ultimately shrink to zero size .",
    "this process is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ profilea ] where we plot the skyrmion density profile for different values of @xmath71 . in the next subsection",
    "we examine this shrinking process for the baby skyrmions more closely . in particular",
    ", we again look at the time scale over which this shrinking occures and find that for current experimental situations it is of the order of , or even longer than , the lifetime of the condensate itself .",
    "finally , we mention here some remarks about the effect of a homogeneous external magnetic field and the slight differences in the scattering lengths of the different hyperfine spin states . in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic field @xmath174",
    ", it will be energetically unfavorable to flip spins . therefore",
    ", this will lead to a further reduction in the spin of the skyrmion and , thus , not to a stabilization .",
    "a slight difference in the various scattering lengths @xmath175 , as appropriate for the spin-1/2 @xmath127rb condensate @xcite , leads to an additional term in the energy expression for the spinor condensate of the form @xmath176 , which has exactly the same effect as an external magnetic field .",
    "it can not stabilize the skyrmion either .",
    "the goal of this section is to estimate the time scale over which the skyrmion shrinks to zero size .",
    "a key element in understanding the dynamics of this process is the behavior of the potential barrier produced by the spin gradients @xmath160 when @xmath71 goes to zero .",
    "this potential is written down explicitly in eq .",
    "( [ gradzeta22 ] ) . when @xmath71 is decreasing the location of the off - centered peak of this potential is approaching the origin as @xmath71 and its height is increasing as @xmath177 .",
    "this potential is thus an isotropic three - dimensional repulsive shell that is increasing in strength as it becomes smaller .",
    "we denote from now on the atoms inside this shell by the `` core '' atoms and the ones outside by the `` external '' atoms .",
    "we have seen in the previous subsection that , in principle , the skyrmion is unstable and that it is energetically favorable for the skyrmion to shrink to zero size irrespective of the initial size .",
    "let us therefore consider a skyrmion of a large initial size such that the height of the corresponding potential barrier is less than the chemical potential @xmath50 of the system .",
    "the density distribution will be almost uniform everywhere except in the region where the barrier has its maximum height . in this region",
    "the density profile will be depleted only slightly .",
    "when the skyrmion starts to shrink the depletion of the density becomes larger , since the height of the barrier increases .",
    "this is achieved physically by transporting the core atoms over the potential barrier to the external region .",
    "so the central density @xmath178 decreases while the skyrmion is shrinking , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ profilea ] . at a certain size",
    "the height of the barrier becomes equal to the chemical potential of the atoms at large distances .",
    "as the skyrmion shrinks even further the barrier height actually exceeds the chemical potential . at this stage",
    "the shrinking process slows down significantly since the core atoms will now have to tunnel through a potential barrier .",
    "the rate of this process will be characterized by the usual wkb tunneling rate , which we calculate now .    to calculate this tunneling rate we assume that the skyrmion has shrunk to a size for which the barrier is so high that the overlap between the wave functions of the core atoms and the external atoms is exponentially small .",
    "the tunneling rate will then be determined by the chemical potential of the core atoms , as well as the barrier height .",
    "we consider the situation that there are @xmath179 core atoms with a chemical potential @xmath180 less than the height of the barrier .",
    "note that physically we must always have that @xmath181 since the collapse of the skyrmion will squeeze the atoms inside the core . for small @xmath182 we notice from eq .",
    "( [ gradzeta22 ] ) that the potential @xmath183 can be approximated by a harmonic potential well with a characteristic frequency @xmath184 that equals @xmath185 for @xmath103 and @xmath186 for @xmath104 .",
    "it thus has a characteristic length @xmath187 for @xmath103 and @xmath188 for @xmath104 .",
    "this allows us to use a thomas - fermi approximation , the validity of which will be discussed below , to calculate @xmath180 .",
    "moreover , the tunneling rate is calculated using the following wkb expression @xcite @xmath189 } \\label{tunneling}.\\ ] ] the radial points @xmath190 and @xmath191 are the points where @xmath183 and @xmath180 intersect .",
    "the use of a thomas - fermi approximation is justified when the mean - field interaction energy of the core atoms is larger than the spacing between the lowest energy levels of the harmonic potential well .",
    "specifically , the ratio @xmath192 should be bigger than 1 .",
    "figure [ rate_baby]a shows the equilibrium size of the baby skyrmion , which is calculated by minimizing the total energy while keeping the number of the core atoms constant , as a function of the number of the core atoms @xmath179 . from this figure",
    "we observe that the above ratio equals approximately 1 for @xmath193 and it increases for larger @xmath179 . for experimental situations , fig .",
    "[ rate_baby]b shows that the skyrmion can live for a time ranging from seconds to hundreds of seconds , which is long enough to be observed .",
    "it should be noted that the above expression , which is based on a variational approach , somewhat overestimates the lifetime of the skyrmion .",
    "however , this is not crucial for our purposes , since by shrinking slightly the lifetime of the skyrmion increases considerably .",
    "a very important dynamical variable of the skyrmion arises from the fact that the euler - lagrange equations for the skyrmion spin texture is invariant under a space independent rotation of the average local spin @xmath194 around the magnetic field direction @xmath195 @xcite .",
    "mathematically , this means that if the spinor @xmath196 describes a skyrmion , then @xmath197 describes also a skyrmion with the same winding number and energy .",
    "the dynamics of the variable @xmath198 associated with this symmetry is determined by the full action for the spin texture @xmath199 = \\int dt ( t[\\zeta ] - e[\\zeta])$ ] , where @xmath96 $ ] and @xmath100 $ ] are given by eqs . ( [ egrad ] ) and ( [ t ] ) with @xmath53 replaced by the density profile @xmath1 of the skyrmion and @xmath85 should now be interpreted as the exact density - density correlation function in the presence of the skyrmion .",
    "hence , substituting @xmath200 and making use of the conservation of total particle number @xmath164 to introduce the change of the average local spin projection on the magnetic field @xmath201 induced by the skyrmion , we obtain , apart from an unimportant boundary term , that the dynamics of the rotation angle @xmath198 is determined by the action @xmath202 = \\int dt~    \\left\\ { \\frac{\\partial \\vartheta(t)}{\\partial t }               \\hbar \\langle \\delta s^{\\rm tot}_{|| } \\rangle      + \\frac{1}{2 } i \\left ( \\frac{\\partial \\vartheta(t)}{\\partial t } \\right)^2    \\right\\}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath203 is the change of the total spin along the magnetic field direction and the `` moment of inertia '' of the skyrmion equals @xmath204 for an adult skyrmion this integral can be performed by substituting @xmath205 and using eq .",
    "( [ response ] ) for @xmath206 .",
    "the explicit expressions for @xmath156 can be found in appendix [ a ] .",
    "an even simpler expression for @xmath206 can be optained by neglecting the gradient terms in eq .",
    "( [ response ] ) . then @xmath207 using this approximation we find , @xmath208    the importance of this result is twofold .",
    "first , from the action in eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) we see that at the quantum level the hamiltonian for the dynamics of the wave function @xmath209 becomes @xmath210 therefore , the ground state wave function is given by @xmath211 , with @xmath212 an integer that is as close as possible to @xmath213 . in this way",
    "we thus recover the fact that according to quantum mechanics the total number of spin - flips associated with the skyrmion texture must be an integer .",
    "more precisely , we have actually shown that the many - body wave function describing the skyrmion is an eigenstate of the operator @xmath214 with eigenvalue @xmath215 .",
    "note that physically this is equivalent to the way in which `` diffusion '' of the overall phase of a bose - einstein condensate leads to the conservation of particle number @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the existence of this internal degree of freedom becomes especially important when we deal with more than one skyrmion in the condensate . in that case",
    "every skyrmion can have its own orientation and we expect the interaction between two skyrmions to have a josephson - like contribution proportional to @xmath216 . as a result",
    "the phase diagram of a gas of skyrmions can become extremely rich and contain both quantum as well as classical , i.e. , nonzero temperature , phase transitions @xcite . in this context",
    ", it is interesting to mention two important differences with the situation in the quantum hall effect .",
    "first , the fact that the spin projection @xmath212 of the skyrmion is an integer shows that these excitations have an integer spin and are therefore bosons @xcite . in the quantum hall case",
    "the skyrmions are fermions with half - integer spin , due to the presence of a topological term in the action @xmath199 $ ] for the spin texture @xcite .",
    "second , in a spinor bose - einstein condensate the skyrmions are not pinned by disorder and are in principle free to move .",
    "both differences will clearly have important consequences for the many - body physics of a skyrmion gas .",
    "focusing again on the single skyrmion dynamics , we can make the last remark more quantitative by using the ansatz @xmath217 for the texture of a moving skyrmion , which is expected to be accurate for small velocities @xmath218 .",
    "considering for illustrative purposes again only the isotropic approximation , we find in a similar way as before that the action for the center - of - mass motion of the skyrmion becomes @xmath219 = \\int dt~   \\frac{1}{2 } m \\left ( \\frac{\\partial { \\bf u}(t)}{\\partial t } \\right)^2~,\\ ] ] where the mass is now simply given by @xmath220 in terms of the superfluid velocity of the spinor condensate @xmath221 . note that in the anisotropic spin-1 case this mass is in principle a tensor , but with only very small nondiagonal components .",
    "similar to the moment of inertia , we can calculate this mass explicitly for adult skyrmions .",
    "the result is @xmath222 the skyrmions thus indeed behave in this respect as ordinary particles .",
    "in contrast to eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) there thus appears no term linear in @xmath218 in the action @xmath223 $ ] .",
    "this is a result of the fact that we have performed all our calculations at zero temperature . in the presence of a normal component",
    ", we anticipate the appearance of such a linear term with an imaginary coefficient .",
    "this will lead to damping of the center - of - mass motion of the skyrmion .",
    "it is interesting to note that if we perform the same analysis for a vortex in a scalar condensate , we find , due to the singular nature of the superfluid velocity field , even at zero temperature an additional term linear in the velocity of the vortex . in a quasi two - dimensional situation",
    ", it is in fact proportional to @xmath224 .",
    "this precisely results in the well - know euler dynamics of vortices .",
    "one important conclusion of this work is that skyrmions in a ferromagnetic bose - einstein condensate are energetically unstable .",
    "however , we have also shown that the time scale on which the skyrmion shrinks can be of the order of , or even larger , than the life time of the condensate .",
    "it turns out that there are two very different mechanisms for the shrinking of the skyrmion .",
    "the first occurs for skyrmions with sizes much larger than the correlation length of the gas . in this case",
    "the shrinking rate is of the order of seconds for realistic experimental parameters .",
    "the second case concerns smaller skyrmions with sizes of the order or less than the correlation length of the system . in this case the shrinking rate is determined by the tunneling rate from the core of the skyrmion to the uniform part of the system .",
    "the tunneling takes place through a potential barrier developed by spin deformations .",
    "the typical time scale for such a shrinking process is of the order of 10 - 100 s.    although we have considered a homogeneous discussion , the inclusion of a trap in the system will not change the main conclusions of this work .",
    "the presence of a trap will have the effect that the uniform density @xmath53 will be now a position - dependent quantity .",
    "therefore , for our calculations to be valid for a trapped gas , the size of the skyrmion must be much less than the typical length scale for the density gradients of the confined condensate .",
    "thus the condition @xmath225 must be met , where @xmath226 is the size of a spherical condensate . for typical experimental conditions we can use the thomas - fermi approximation to the size of the condensate@xcite , which reads @xmath227 where @xmath164 is the number of atoms in the condensate and @xmath228 is the characteristic length of a harmonic trap of frequency @xmath184 . scaling @xmath226 to the correlation length @xmath79 ,",
    "the former takes the form @xmath229 . for a @xmath127rb condensate with @xmath230 atoms and a trap frequency of the order of @xmath231 rad",
    "/ s this gives @xmath232 .",
    "this gives an estimate for the maximum size of a skyrmion such that the above condition remains valid .",
    "for example , our theory for adult skyrmions is applicable for the size range of @xmath233 up to say @xmath234 .",
    "another important remark about a confined gas is that skyrmions will tend to move towards the surface of the bose - einstein condensate since the density there is lower and thus their energy will be less .",
    "apparently , this leads to a decrease in the shrinking rate since for both adult and baby skyrmions the shrinking time is proportional to @xmath235 , see eq .",
    "( [ lambdasol ] ) and the discussion afterwards , and eq .",
    "( [ tunneling ] ) and the discussion before it .",
    "however , our theory for the shrinking rates of skyrmions clearly breaks down on the surface since there the typical length scale for the density gradients due to the trap are of the same order as the correlation length .",
    "although skyrmion - antiskyrmion pairs can be created by the kibble mechanism in a temperature quench or by sufficiently shaking up the condensate , a more controlled way of creating a skyrmion can be achieved by using a magnetic field configuration in which the fictitious magnetic field is always pointing radially outward and its magnitude increases monotonically from zero at the origin to a maximum value for large distances from the origin @xcite . applying this field configuration for such a long time that the spins at large distances have precessed exactly twice around the local magnetic field ,",
    "creates a single skyrmion .",
    "of course , for a real magnetic field the above configuration requires the use of magnetic monopoles , but for a fictitious magnetic field it can be achieved by appropriately tailoring the detuning , the polarization and the intensity of two pulsed raman lasers .",
    "the required spatial dependence of the detuning can be created experimentally by separating the centers of the magnetic traps for the two spin species along the @xmath23-axis @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the desired behavior of the rabi frequency can be achieved by making with the first raman laser two standing waves in the @xmath236 and @xmath237 directions that are both polarized perpendicular to the @xmath23-axis . for the other raman laser",
    "we only need to require that it produces a traveling wave with a polarization that has a nonzero projection on the @xmath23-axis , since we want to realize a @xmath238 transition in this case . in the above geometry",
    "the skyrmion is created exactly in the plane where the detuning vanishes and in the nodes of the first raman laser .",
    "note that since the distance between these nodes is generally much bigger than the correlation length , we create in this manner a large skyrmion that will start to shrink but ultimately selfstabilizes at a smaller size .",
    "once created , the skyrmion can be easily observed by the usual expansion experiments that have recently also been used to observe vortices @xcite .",
    "similar as with vortex rings , we then observe an almost complete depletion of the condensate in a ring around the position of the skyrmion .",
