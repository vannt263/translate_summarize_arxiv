    "typical elm signals are shown in fig.[fig1 ] . here",
    ", we try to model type - i and type - iii elm signals of @xmath0 .",
    "jet typical elm signals ( [ perez2004 , thesis]).,width=321 ]    we just focus on the signal itself and ignore all the other information behind , i.e. , we just discuss how to use ( as simple as possible ) equations or other approaches to reproduce the shape of these signals .",
    "it is qualitative or at most semi - quantitative .",
    "this is a wide used approach for modeling . for example , the famous prey - predator model for fishbone and drift wave - zonal flow system .",
    "one may also extend it to pde to contain the spatial information .",
    "indeed , this way has been used to model elm and l - h transit in literatures , e.g. , [ diamond1994 ] , [ itoh1991 , 1993 , 1999 ] .    if we assume that the dynamic of signal is not explicit depend on time @xmath1 , then one equation @xmath2 is not enough because that @xmath3 is not single valued with @xmath4 .",
    "so , at least , we must use second order equation or use two first order equations . while , one second order equation is just a special case of two first order equations .",
    "in this example , we use the second option , i.e. , two first order equations , which is also used in [ diamond1994 ] .",
    "the equations are @xmath5    a result is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : ode1 ] .",
    "ode for modeling elm , example 1.,width=321 ]    the physical explanations of the equations and parameters can be found in [ diamond1994 ] , however , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "using one second order equation , e.g. , @xmath8 which is modified from stiff system equation , a result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ode2 ] .",
    "the shape is very similar to the pde result in [ itoh1993 ] .",
    "but , an apparent drawback of ( [ eq : ode2 ] ) is that the signal @xmath4 is not always positive here .",
    "ode for modeling elm , example 2.,width=321 ]",
    "ddes contain derivatives which depend on previous time .",
    "we guess some equations here .",
    "the equations are from or modified from [ shampine2000 ] .",
    "there is also a type of dde has sawtooth solutions ( see e.g. , [ mallet - paret2011 ] ) , which may be also suitable for model the unsolved sawteeth phenomena in magnetic confined fusion study .",
    "the equation is @xmath9     dde for modeling elm , example 1.,width=321 ]    results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dde1 ] .",
    "equation is @xmath10 which is original to model four - year cycle of the population of lemmings .",
    "dde for modeling elm , example 2.,width=321 ]    the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dde2 ] .",
    "this is a more intuitive way to model elm , which combines different time scales using a more acceptable approach .",
    "the burst of elm signal is suggested related to peeling - ballooning mode in standard elm model ( [ connor1998 ] ) .",
    "so , we give two time scale : transport time scale and ballooning mode time scale .    to simplify the transport process , the transport time scale is modeled using @xmath11    when pressure gradient exceeds marginal value ( using @xmath12 to represent it ) , the ballooning mode occurs .",
    "the signals will grow exponentially @xmath13 with the characteristic time @xmath14 .    when @xmath15 exceeds a marginal value @xmath16 , the plasma crash .",
    "and then , go to next cycle .",
    "we also add some randomicities to @xmath12 and @xmath16 to make the whole signal more like the actual experimental signal . a result",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : demc ] .",
    "demc modeling for elm.,width=321 ]    this simple demc model captures some fundamental properties of integrated simulations , such as [ chang2008 ] and [ lonnroth2009 ] .",
    "which one is more reasonable ? at present , i choose demc @xmath17 ode @xmath17 dde . while , maybe none of them can be final explanation of elm or h - mode .",
    "there is another math tool called fractional differential equation ( fde ) , which has been used for anomalous transport / diffusion problems in some areas . for plasma community",
    ", fde is not wide accepted yet , but it is possible in the future .",
    "fde is hard to give periodic solutions as elm at present .",
    "so , i havent given examples .",
