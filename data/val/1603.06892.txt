    "although statistical mechanics has been firmly established more than hundred years ago  @xcite , simple liquids remain a persistent challenge when cooled to low temperatures . in particular the dramatic super - arrhenius increase of the relaxation time",
    "so far eludes a generally accepted explanation . a multitude of theoretical approaches has been advanced  @xcite , but obtaining data that enables discrimination between these is challenging , due not least to the difficulties in handling the huge timescales required to equilibrate such supercooled liquids . at some point",
    "( typically bypassing crystallization ) the relaxation time @xmath0 exceeds the experimentally or numerically accessible time scale @xmath1 and the liquid falls out of equilibrium into a dynamically arrested state called a glass .",
    "the idea that a true phase transition is controlling dynamic arrest has been around for a long time , starting with an observation by kauzmann  @xcite : extrapolating the configurational entropy of the liquid suggests that it should fall below that of the crystalline solid at a finite ( kauzmann ) temperature @xmath2 .",
    "one resolution of this apparent paradox is to posit a thermodynamic transition to an `` ideal glass '' with very low configurational entropy .",
    "more recent theories continue to use the language of phase transitions although they disagree on even the most basic assumptions . on one hand",
    "the emergence of criticality in a rugged free - energy landscape is anticipated through freezing , not to a single crystal but to a vast number of random , aperiodic states  @xcite ; a picture that finds justification from mean - field results obtained in higher dimension  @xcite .",
    "approaches based on replica symmetry breaking also imagine a phase transition to state where configurations are closely related to one another , i.e. they have high overlap  @xcite .",
    "another example , geometric frustration , posits that geometric motifs that minimise the local free energy ( locally favoured structures - lfs ) are favoured upon supercooling and that the arrest seen is a manifestation of an avoided phase transition .",
    "approaching the ideal glass transition , the system may seek to minimise its entropy , which can correspond to an increase in lfs  @xcite .",
    "quite in contrast , in dynamical facilitation theory  @xcite dynamical correlations are the fundamental mechanism for the slow - down with static correlations being absent or at least irrelevant . again",
    "the notion of a phase transition is pivotal , but now the transition is between two dynamic regimes : the supercooled liquid and a state with extremely slow dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the mathematical framework is that of statistical mechanics combined with large deviations  @xcite .",
    "the transition shares many similarities with the disorder - order transition of an ising magnet ; the main conceptual difference being that configurations are replaced by trajectories and the order parameter measures particle motion instead of magnetization .",
    "an intriguing prediction is the coexistence between the two dynamical regimes , which in lattice models is predicted to terminate in two critical points  @xcite .",
    "while numerical evidence supports coexistence and a first - order transition  @xcite , the putative lower critical point remains out of reach for direct numerical investigations in atomistic models .",
    "although structural changes appear to be minor when looking at two - point measures like the structure factor , the population of locally favoured structures and related structural motifs show a strong temperature - dependence  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the dynamical transition to a liquid with very low particle mobility can be driven by increasing the lfs population  @xcite , indicating that these structural changes are not only a byproduct of cooling but play a crucial role in the dynamic arrest .",
    "this finding is corroborated by simulations showing that single particle motion and lfs are correlated  @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations are an indispensable tool to gain microscopic insights . however , accessible time scales are still nine to ten decades away from the experimental glass transition temperature and more indirect methods have to be devised . for example , pinning ( or confinement ) of particles  @xcite shifts the putative thermodynamic transition into the time - window accessible to computer simulation , as has the observation of distributions of overlaps in configurations of particles  @xcite . a further method to generate deeply supercooled , equilibrated configurations",
    "is particle swaps  @xcite .",
    "here we tackle the challenge of determining the low - temperature equilibrium behavior of a popular atomistic glass former , the kob - andersen binary mixture  @xcite , which is loosely based on the metallic glass former ni@xmath3p@xmath4 . to this end",
    "we introduce a powerful numerical method that exploits three effects : first , the central configurations of biased trajectories contain many lfs .",
    "second , a higher population of lfs facilitates the sampling of configurations with low energies even at moderately supercooled temperatures . adapting existing methods to remove the simulation bias , not only the simulated state point but",
    "a region in its vicinity becomes accessible .",
    "the third effect is that the contribution to the total free energy from the local minima in the potential energy landscape and from the vibrational free energy decouple  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to access equilibrium properties at configurational temperatures @xmath5 ( as opposed to the `` vibrational '' temperature ) different from the sampling temperature @xmath6 .    using the described method",
    ", we perform extensive biased simulations for the kob - andersen mixture , from which we construct part of the phase diagram for the dynamic first - order transition from lfs - poor to lfs - rich .",
    "we find numerical evidence that coexistence is terminated at a finite temperature , which implies a lower critical point accessible by the equilibrium system  if it could be cooled sufficiently slowly .",
    "this scenario has significant consequences because the dynamical transition at a higher temperature thus probes the same glassy states while circumventing the prohibitive increase of equilibration times .",
    "the kob - andersen binary mixture  @xcite consists of 80% large particles and 20% small particles interacting through truncated and shifted lennard - jones pair potentials .",
    "we employ the original potential parameters .",
    "all numerical values are reported in lennard - jones units with respect to the large particles , and we set boltzmann s constant to unity .",

    "[ fig : basics]a ) has been shown to correlate well with the propensity of particle mobility on lowering the temperature  @xcite .",
    "steepest descent quenches of the central configurations @xmath23 to the local minima of the energy landscape yield the so - called inherent states  @xcite , which may be thought of as particle configurations with the thermal noise removed .",
    "these inherent states @xmath24 constitute the local minima in the energy landscape around which particles vibrate before reaching another local minimum .",
    "while in a perfect crystal there would be only one inherent state , in the liquid there are many different particle arrangements , and the number of these accessible amorphous inherent states defines the configurational entropy .",

    "ground states of equivalent energies have been obtained employing basin hopping techniques  @xcite confirming that the reported values for @xmath29 should be understood as upper ( although tight ) bounds to the true inherent state energies .",
    "we go beyond the temperature regime that is accessible in conventional molecular dynamics simulations . to this end",
    "biased simulations with @xmath30 and @xmath31 particles are run at a moderately supercooled sampling temperature @xmath6 to faster explore phase space while at the same time sampling configurations with very low potential energy and a high population of lfs . to improve the sampling we employ replica exchange  @xcite .",

    "transition path sampling @xcite is performed according to the structural bias in @xmath39 but any observable ( including both @xmath29 and @xmath39 ) can be simultaneously tracked and its correct probability distribution , and in particular its mean value , can be recovered reassigning the correct weight to each trajectory , as illustrated by eq .",

    "now , previous work @xcite has demonstrated via thermodynamic integration that for sufficiently low temperatures ( @xmath41 ) , the contribution of the inherent state energies to the free energy decouples from the vibrational contribution .    to show how it is possible to extract the equilibrium statistics of inherent state energies from the trajectory sampling , we split the total potential energy @xmath42 , leading to @xmath43 with partition sum @xmath44 and restricted partition sum @xmath45 sampling the fluctuations out of the inherent state @xmath28 .",

    "( iv )  finally , the same overlap order parameter  @xcite has been used to show that static fluctuations exist for @xmath96 , consistent with the existence of a random critical point predicted by effective field theories @xcite .    in our case ,",
    "the thermodynamic behaviour of the system follows from the more general and complex description of its non - equilibrium phase diagram , where the equilibrium limit corresponds to @xmath97 .",

    "our results support the idea that the low temperature fate of supercooled atomistic glass formers is determined by the fluctuations of the population of local structures .",
    "there is now ample numerical evidence that particle dynamics , at least for a class of strongly non - mean - field model glassformers  @xcite , is correlated with the presence of lfs .",
    "we attribute the emergence of slow dynamics , dynamical heterogeneities , and critical - like behaviour to a ( dynamical ) critical point that terminates non - equilibrium coexistence of two structural phases , lfs - poor and lfs - rich .",
