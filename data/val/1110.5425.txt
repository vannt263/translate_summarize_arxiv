    "the idea that the dimer and ising statistical models on finite graphs have , as a limit , the free fermion conformal field theory in dimension @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , has become a well established theme in mathematical physics ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) . yet",
    ", great challenges remain on the road to developing this into a mathematically rigorous theory . a part of the difficulty is in reconciling the languages and concepts of graph theory and conformal field theory : the structure of conformal field theory predicts many features which are not readily visible on graphs .",
    "one must develop mechanisms how such features originate on the graph level and will fully manifest themselves in the limit .",
    "the purpose of this paper is , in some sense , to begin this investigation in earnest .",
    "we record some of the phenomena which need to modelled .",
    "we also obtain concrete results as first steps in the desired direction .",
    "while conformal field theory was long considered a part of the domain of physics , rigorous mathematical approaches now do exist .",
    "perhaps most appealing is the `` naive '' approach due to graeme segal @xcite , which asks for a hilbert space @xmath2 , and for each riemann surface @xmath3 with analytically parametrized boundary components , an element @xmath4 ( defined up to scalar multiple ) of the hilbert tensor product of copies of @xmath2 and its dual indexed by the boundary components ( depending on orientation ) , satisfying appropriate `` gluing axioms '' .",
    "the paper @xcite is just an outline , and details have been since filled in , in part by kriz and his co - authors @xcite .",
    "a competing approach , starting with the notion of vertex algebra , was started by borcherds @xcite and frenkel - lepowsky - meurman @xcite ( see also beilinson - drinfeld @xcite ) .",
    "this approach models only a part of the gluing structure postulated by segal , but has the advantage that a vertex algebra is a completely algebraic concept , which does not require analysis . a vertex algebra , however , models only a part of conformal field theory , the `` chiral @xmath5-sector '' .",
    "an extension of the approach which models a whole conformal field theory , was developed by huang and lepowsky @xcite , but it does involve analysis , although not hilbert spaces . efforts to model the entire conformal field theory as a completely algebraic concept",
    "are underway @xcite .",
    "the mathematically richest case of conformal field theory is a _ rational conformal field theory _",
    ", when there is a finite set of _ labels _ @xmath6 with an involution @xmath7 and the hilbert space breaks up as @xmath8 the hilbert spaces @xmath9 are called _ chiral sectors _ and are subject to additional axioms .",
    "parallel to the formula ( [ echiral ] ) , there is a formula on graded dimensions , the _ partition function formula _ ( formula ( [ ecftfactor ] ) below ) .",
    "a major advantage of the vertex algebra approach is that it predicts from a vertex algebra alone ( i.e. algebraic data ) when we get a rational conformal field theory , and gives an algebraic formula for its sectors ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the free fermion is now completely described mathematically as a conformal field theory both in the segal and vertex algebra formalisms ( see @xcite ) . yet",
    ", the theory is more subtle than one might think .",
    "we describe some of the issues involved in section [ fcft ] below . for one thing , a rational conformal field theory in the precise sense outlined above actually describes the _ bosonisation _ of the free fermion .",
    "there is a variant of the above description , called a _ fermionic rational conformal field theory _ , which is more closely related to the topic of this paper .",
    "it is actually the fermionic rational conformal field theory analogue of the partition function formula ( formula ( [ ecftfactori ] ) , and its analogues for higher genus ) we are interested in . in the case of the free fermion ,",
    "this formula ( [ ed3 ] ) is precisely a sum over spin structures of a riemann surface of genus @xmath10 , with a factor @xmath11 , which matches the formula on graph dimer partition function found by cimasoni and reshetikhin @xcite .",
    "the present paper is mainly about graphs .",
    "how can we model the concepts mentioned discretely ?",
    "fortunately , great strides have already been made .",
    "mercat and kenyon @xcite defined critically embedded graphs on riemann surfaces , which give discrete models the conformal structure . a basic quantum field theory - like gluing property of the dimer model was observed by cimasoni and reshetikhyn @xcite .",
    "a large part of the present paper ( sections [ s.dg ] , [ sec.str ] ) consists of examining the gluing property in more detail , both for the ising and dimer models .",
    "our main new result in this direction is proving a gluing formula not just for the entire partition function , but for its summands , i.e. discrete analogues of ( [ ed3 ] ) , ( [ ecftfactori ] ) .",
    "more precisely , we consider _ arbitrary _ labellings , not only critical ones ; this generality , the formula is actually related to quantum field theory ( not conformal field theory ) . the conformal case , however , is the one we need to consider for taking scaling limits . for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict to the case of a double torus being cut into two surfaces of genus @xmath1 , but it is straightforward to generalize the formula to more general cuts along separating curves .",
    "our gluing formula is substantially more difficult to obtain than the formula of @xcite .",
    "instead of cutting along a system of edges of a graph embedded into a riemann surface by a separating curve , we consider a separating curve containing vertices only of the graph . to obtain a cutting ( gluing ) formula for partition functions",
    ", we must perform a certain graph - theoretical constrution on the graphs resulting from the cut ( introducing new subgraphs which we call _ core _ in the case of the dimer and _ target _ in the case of the ising model ) .",
    "our main gluing theorems are theorems [ thm.d1 ] and [ thm.d2 ] of section [ sec.str ] .    to work our way closer toward a limit formula , we need to understand how gluing works mathematically in the fermion conformal field theory .",
    "this is done in section [ fermion ] . even though there are both mathematical and physical approaches ( e.g. @xcite ) , as far as we know , there is no treatment in the literature which would include a mathematically precise definition of the data at a closed riemann surface in terms of the dirac operator , and the related cases of gluing .",
    "we write the dirac operator on a riemann surface in a conformally invariant form , and write down a definition and gluing properties of its determinant with respect to gluing along curves with antiperiodic spin structure .",
    "( the determinant is the square of the pfaffian : we restrict to the case of the determinant because it is much simpler technically . ) a rigorous discrete - to - continuous limit formula for one of the chiral partition functions of the chiral fermion on a torus is the topic of section [ slimit ] .",
    "previous work on this was done by cohn , kenyon and propp who work out a formula in the case of rectangular dominoes @xcite ( in fact , in the case of a parallelogram , it was worked out already by kasteleyn @xcite , see also ferdinand @xcite ) .",
    "a heuristic approach in a more general situation is done in @xcite . a general obstacle to deal with , which we havent mentioned above ,",
    "is the _ conformal anomaly _ , namely the fact that the elements @xmath4 are defined only up to scalar multiple .",
    "( in the chiral sector , this propagates into the elaborate structure of a _ modular functor _ , some of which is described in section [ fcft ] . ) to deal with this difficulty , one encounters a phenomenon in nearly all discrete - to - continuous limits in physics : _",
    "regularization_. typically , one encounters a limit which does not exist , and is `` regularized '' by replacing it with a somewhat different but compellingly similar expression . in the present setting ,",
    "we prove for arbitrary periodic critical embedding in a torus that the limit does not exist , and can be regularized by replacing , at one point , a set of parameters by their absolute values , after which the cft limit is obtained .",
    "there is yet another complication in a rigorous approach to discrete - to - continuous limits in the case of the ising model , which does not arise in the case of the dimer model : while in the case of the dimer model , the limit theory is the @xmath0-dimensional fermion cft , for the ising model , the limit theory should be the @xmath1-dimensional fermion @xcite , which , despite similar terminology , is considerably more subtle , and involves a construction of p. deligne using super - central simple algebras over @xmath12 .",
    "whether natural discrete versions of these concepts exist is an open problem , which we discuss at the end of section [ fcft ] .",
    "let @xmath13 be a finite unoriented graph consisting of vertices @xmath14 and edges @xmath15 , in which loop - edges and multiple edges are allowed .",

    "there are however two caveats to applying mercat s theorem : first of all , mercat is considering a slightly different setup , not assuming that the graph @xmath344 is bipartite .",
    "he works with tilings by rhomboids ; the graph made by the edges of the rhomboids is naturally bipartite , with the vertices of the graphs @xmath344 , @xmath350 being the vertices of the two different colors .",
    "second , mercat s result applies to tilings of simply connected subsets of @xmath12 , and he does not specify how many discrete exponentials are needed to get a basis of the space of discrete holomorphic functions ; in order for the formula ( [ ed * ] ) to be strictly correct , we would have to prove that discrete exponentials @xmath351 for such @xmath246 that @xmath352 precisely form a basis of discrete holomorphic functions on @xmath344 tiling @xmath353 twisted by the antiperiodic spin structure on @xmath346 $ ] , @xmath354 .",
    "one precise statement ( for the case of a rhomboid graph ) is as follows :    [ trace ] consider a bipartite graph @xmath344 critically embedded into the torus @xmath355 ( @xmath356 ) in such a way that there exist complex numbers @xmath357 , @xmath358 of equal absolute value such that @xmath359 , @xmath360 , and the corresponding rhomboid graph on @xmath361 has edges @xmath362 @xmath363 ( here we consider the subscripts as elements of @xmath364 , @xmath365 ) .",
    "assume further that the vertex @xmath5 is black , and assume that the spin structure of @xmath366 around @xmath346 $ ] is antiperiodic .",
    "then the kasteleyn matrix of @xmath344 satisfies @xmath367 where @xmath347 are kenyon exponentials @xcite , and @xmath368 ranges over all complex numbers for which @xmath369 and the sign depends on the spin structure of @xmath349 $ ] .    this is not as easy to generalize as one may think . in particular , in case of more general riemann surfaces , a straightforward generalization of this formula is false .",
    "a heuristic explanation may be extracted from section [ fermion ] above : in general , we are unable to identify functions with @xmath290-forms in boundary behavior , and transformation rules for @xmath290-forms would have to be modelled discretely .    because of continuity , it suffices to prove the formula for generic values of @xmath370 , @xmath371 . consider for @xmath372 the sets of black vertices of @xmath344 @xmath373 and the sets of white vertices of @xmath344 @xmath374 the kenyon exponential function @xmath347 with base point @xmath5 is on the black vertex @xmath375 equal to @xmath376 recall that we denoted by @xmath377 all numbers satisfying ( [ eantip ] ) .",
    "consider functions @xmath378 where @xmath379 we claim that for generic values of @xmath370 , @xmath371 , @xmath380 form a basis of the space of all functions @xmath381 . in effect , it is true for @xmath382 by direct computation , and hence it is true generically ( since non - degeneracy occurs on a zariski - open set ) .",
    "now by direct computation , @xmath383 where @xmath384 are functions defined as follows : @xmath385 note that for each @xmath46 , the matrix ( [ edebar+ ] ) in the basis @xmath386 is @xmath387 which has determinant @xmath388 but now the function @xmath389 which is defined by @xmath390 plays a symmetric role to @xmath391 which respect to exchanging @xmath335 for @xmath392 , and the base change between @xmath10 and @xmath393 is conjugate to the matrix @xmath394 which is @xmath0 .    to try to obtain a limit over tilings with decreasing length of rhomboid edge , it further seems natural to use a recipe of mercat @xcite how to take the limit in order to make discrete exponentials converge to ordinary continuous exponentials : subdivide each rhomboid into 4 equal rhomboids with parallel edges , and repeat this procedure . even in simple examples",
    ", however , we see that this procedure when applied to ( [ ed * ] ) , will _ not _ produce a convergent limit in the naive sense : the limit has to be `` regularized '' ( which is not surprising , given the usual physical context of lattice regularization ) .",
    "for example , if the segment @xmath346 $ ] is tiled into equal segments by the edges of @xmath344 , the equation ( [ egper ] ) becomes @xmath395 which implies that @xmath246 is on the imaginary line .",
    "then ( [ ed * ] ) becomes a product of quantities of the form @xmath396 so given @xmath356 , for @xmath397 , the second summand ( [ egper1 ] ) will have absolute value @xmath398 .",
    "the number of such terms will increase with @xmath399 , as solutions of ( [ egper ] ) in increasing bounded regions will approach @xmath400 , @xmath401 .",
    "therefore , the expression ( [ ed * ] ) in this case can not converge as @xmath402 .",
    "the `` limit '' has to be taken in the sense of @xmath403 @xmath404 ( the right hand side being the desired ratio of a theta function by @xmath405 ) , based on the  calculation \" @xmath406 @xmath407 in this special case , the regularization can be achieved by multiplying ( [ ed * ] ) by @xmath408 where the product is over solutions of ( [ egper ] ) with @xmath397 .",
    "this regularization indeed produces the desired ratio of @xmath409 and @xmath405 in the limit , multiplied by the factor @xmath410 .",
    "therefore , in some sense , for a general graph , the question entails finding a regularization procedure which would generalize ( [ egper2 ] ) . again",
    ", one precise statement can be obtained as follows .",
    "define @xmath411    [ plimit ] suppose graphs @xmath412 are as in proposition [ trace ] , and that the rhomboid graph of @xmath413 is obtained from the rhomboid graph of @xmath412 by subdividing each rhomboid into 4 congruent rhomboids with parallel edges .",
