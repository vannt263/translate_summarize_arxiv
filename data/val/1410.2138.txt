    "these experimental advancements and associated new possibilities for elucidating quantum motion on an ultrafast timescale challenge theory .",
    "clearly , approaches that treat electron correlation and at the same time are explicitly time - dependent are needed to fully exploit the potential of the experimental capabilities .",
    "the development and application of such a time - dependent ( td ) quantum theory for the many - electron problem ( mep ) including a possibly strong external field is the topic of the present work .    over the years",
    ", various approaches for the solution of the tdmep on a quantum - mechanical level have been proposed and applied . on the one hand",
    ", there exist approximative methods which consider a reduced number of electrons ( typically one or two ) in precalculated pseudo potentials created by frozen electrons that are assumed to be inactive in the considered dynamics , apart from contributing to the potential governing the motion of the active electrons .",
    "this approach results in the single- and two - active - electron approximations ( sae / tae ) for which the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) has been solved for photoionization , high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) and related phenomena since the late 80 s  @xcite .",
    "the appeal of these methods is their flexibility and numerical feasibility with respect to the considered systems .",
    "the dynamical effects of the frozen electrons , however , can not be tested within these sae and tae approximations , and likewise there is no explicit account of electron correlation in general . to this end",
    ", approaches have been developed where all electrons are treated simultaneously on different levels of `` activity '' .",
    "numerical tractable methods are either achieved by approximating the electron - electron ( e - e ) interactions or by reducing the configuration space . among these methods",
    "are the time - dependent configuration - interaction ( td - ci ) method and its truncations , where in particular the simplest td - ci - singles ( td - cis ) with only single - orbital excitation out of the hartree - fock ( hf ) ground state has been applied @xcite .",
    "in addition , we mention the time - dependent density functional theory  @xcite , time - dependent natural orbital theory  @xcite , time - dependent coupled - cluster theory  @xcite , the non - equilibrium green s functions approaches  @xcite , and the state - specific expansion approach  @xcite . up to now , in particular the time - dependent r - matrix theory  @xcite and the multi - configurational time - dependent hartree fock ( mctdhf ) method  @xcite have found applications in the photoionization community . in the perturbative regime for the matter - light interaction ,",
    "the mctdhf method has been applied to the determination of inner - shell photoionization cross sections for molecular hydrogen fluoride  @xcite .",
    "the number of configurations in the mctdhf method increases exponentially with respect to the number of electrons due to the full - ci expansion .",
    "this makes the method infeasible for systems having more than a few electrons interacting with a strong field . the td complete - active - space self - consistent - field method ( td - cascf )  @xcite , and the more general td restricted - active space scf ( td - rasscf )",
    "@xcite cure this scaling by imposing restrictions on the active orbital spaces , while keeping the attractive scf notion of the mctdhf approach , i.e. , the orbitals are time - dependent and optimally updated in each time - step .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the td generalized - active - space ( gas ) ci concept , which is based on a general ci truncation scheme adapted from ( time - independent ) quantum chemistry . in the gas / ras",
    "approach  @xcite the single - particle basis is partitioned into physically motivated subsets and only the configurations that are expected to be most relevant for the processes under consideration are included in the ci expansion , and thus reducing the number of configurations considerably . by specifying the gas , generalizations of the sae and tae approximations , without the need of contracting pseudo potentials ,",
    "are readily obtained as limiting cases . moreover ci truncations , such as cis , cis - doubles ( cisd ) , cisd - triples ( cisdt ) , etc . can be easily specified and the method , accordingly , allows a straightforward increase in the account of electron correlation within a specified active orbital space .",
    "the present method is similar to the time - dependent restricted - active - space ( td - ras ) ci scheme  @xcite , which was applied to calculate the photoionization cross sections of beryllium and neon  @xcite .",
    "a fundamental problem of any truncated ci method is the choice of a good orbital basis . in this work",
    ", we address this issue with the focus on time - dependent excitations and give a detailed analysis of different choices : pseudo - orbitals based on hf orbitals similar to  @xcite , an adapted version for larger systems and natural orbitals .",
    "further , we demonstrate in the limiting case of 4 electrons the convergence of the method by detailed comparison with fully - correlated tdse or equivalent calculations . in addition , we give details of the implementation and extend the approach to small molecules in strong external fields .",
    "in particular the approach allows us to uncover a strong effect of electron correlation on the preferred emission direction of photoelectrons .",
