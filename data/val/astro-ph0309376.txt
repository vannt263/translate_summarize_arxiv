    "in conventional cosmological scenario the universe has a beginning in time , so called big bang , associated with initial singularity of friedmann equations @xcite .",
    "singular state with infinite values of energy density and curvature is unacceptable from physical point of view and possibly marks the edge of applicability of general relativity ( gr ) . in spite of some progress in last decades , attempts to resolve this problem within gr had no success @xcite .",
    "correct description of the early universe when the energy density was very high should be given by particle physics @xcite .",
    "at the same time experimental and observational data are still insufficient to discriminate between different models of elementary particles physics .",
    "however in most models scalar fields play an important role .",
    "one of the main discovery in modern cosmology is a possibility to explain a number of puzzles of big bang model by inclusion of short stage of exponential expansion of the universe , so called inflation @xcite . during this stage the energy density of the universe is dominated by a scalar field ( or fields ) and transition to usual hot universe is achieved by creation of relativistic particles at the end of inflation @xcite .",
    "unfortunately even within inflationary models there is little chance to avoid cosmological singularity @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the universe is usually considered from the planckian moment when description in terms of classical theory of gravitation becomes possible . at contraction stage",
    "the singular state is unavoidable in most models @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , some nonsingular inflationary solutions exist @xcite .",
    "although generality of these solutions is known to be small @xcite , they are still of some interest in the literature @xcite .",
    "in fact , inflationary initial conditions for the scalar field are the same for bouncing inflationary models .",
    "it is known that in order to have nonsingular cosmological model with the scalar field the potential part of the energy density at the bounce must be larger than the kinetic part .",
    "these conditions lead automatically to subsequent inflation in the case when the scalar field exceeds the planckian value at the bounce .",
    "therefore it was expected that nonsingular inflationary models are also quite probable @xcite .",
    "generality of inflation was studied , for instance , in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was pointed out that although infinite number of nonsingular inflationary solutions exist within gr , exponential contraction stage of these solutions is unstable . by defining a measure on the phase plane where the hubble parameter equals zero ,",
    "the probability of bouncing inflationary solutions was estimated to be of order unity @xcite . at the same time ,",
    "probability of nonsingular solutions with massive scalar field was estimated @xcite to be @xmath0 .",
    "from the other hand , deviations from riemannian geometry can occur at very high energy density . in more general spacetimes gr",
    "should be replaced by gauge theories of gravity ( gtg ) that are natural generalizations of gr @xcite .",
    "it was shown that nonsingular cosmological solutions within gtg exist in the case of spinning matter @xcite , usual matter @xcite and matter in the form of scalar field @xcite .",
    "moreover , when energy density becomes small enough the deviation from gr becomes negligible and at late stages the universe can be described by friedmann equations .",

    "analytical solutions for functions @xmath94 and @xmath69 in the case @xmath95 can also be obtained after substitution of @xmath88 from ( [ psi1 ] ) but they look quite intricate . the most important point concerning these solutions is that both for contraction and expansion stages they can be represented as    @xmath96    where @xmath97 are constants and @xmath98 .",

    "again analytical and numerical results are in good agreement except for @xmath88 function at transition stage .",
    "this is in fact the most interesting case because perturbations in the hubble parameter and the scale factor diverge exponentially with time but there is an asymmetry so the hubble parameter tends to large _ negative _ values .    in realistic models approximation",
    "@xmath111 is satisfied during inflation and it is also valid during exponential contraction in nonsingular models . while the scalar field changes slightly , scalar field derivative grows exponentially and the kinetic part of the energy density soon starts to dominate over potential part",

    "therefore , conditions ( [ grbounce ] ) can not be satisfied for majority of solutions both within gr ( with minimal or nonminimal coupling ) and gtg at the bounce .",
