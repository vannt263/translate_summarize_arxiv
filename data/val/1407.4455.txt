    "the initial mass function ( imf ) dictates the distribution of stellar masses for any single star formation event in a galaxy .",
    "consequently , it determines the number of massive stars formed and being responsible for the feedback and chemical processes .",
    "the imf also fix the numbers of low - mass stars , which dominate the total stellar mass of a galaxy .    growing evidence support a non - universal imf in the nearby universe , where massive early - type galaxies ( etgs ) show an enhanced fraction of dwarf stars in the center compared to the milky way @xcite .",
    "moreover , the dwarf - to - giant ratio , i.e. , the imf slope , correlates with the central velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "these results challenge the existence of a universal imf inferred from resolved stellar population analysis in the local group @xcite .    to have a consistent picture of galaxy evolution , it is absolutely necessary to investigate the imf at different redshifts .",
    "so far , the imf of z@xmath111 galaxies has been studied indirectly using virial masses @xcite or elaborated dynamical models @xcite .",
    "these works point to a @xcite imf for massive galaxies at intermediate redshift .",
    "other indirect imf - sensitive observables have also been used in the topic .",
    "for instance , the consistency between the cosmic stellar mass and star formation rate densities @xcite and the luminosity evolution of massive etgs @xcite are better described by a flatter ( i.e. , with a relatively larger number of massive stars ) imf at higher look - back times . even in star - forming galaxies ,",
    "the constancy of the imf is in tension with observations @xcite    here we explore , for the first time , the imf slope at z@xmath121 using stellar populations synthesis models in massive quiescent galaxies ( mqgs ) . to achieve this goal ,",

    "the imf inference is explained in section  3 . in section  4",

    "we adopt a standard cosmology : h@xmath13= 70 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 , @xmath15= 0.3 , and @xmath16=0.7 .",
    "to facilitate the determination of the imf slope at high - z , we study galaxies with no signs of recent star formation ( quiescent galaxies ) .",
    "these objects have simpler star formation histories ( sfhs ) than star - forming galaxies and are sufficiently well represented by a single stellar population ( ssp ) model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "mqgs at 0.9@xmath0z@xmath01.5 were selected with two criteria : ( 1 ) the @xmath17 diagram complemented with fluxes in the mir / fir ; and ( 2 ) a ssfr vs. stellar mass plot .",

    "we selected all galaxies with @xmath30@xmath025.5  mag from the f160w imaging in candels @xcite and reduced the grism data to extract 2d spectra using the axe software ( version 2.3 ) .",

    "we dissected the sample to probe the lowest and highest mass regimes with two stacked spectra of similar snr ( figures  [ data],[data2 ] ) .",
    "the high - mass sample was composed by 7 galaxies with m@xmath310@xmath4  m@xmath5 ( @xmath30=19.7 - 21.3  mag ) , and the low - mass spectra by 50 galaxies with m@xmath0 2@xmath810@xmath9  m@xmath5 ( @xmath30=20.3 - 22.4  mag ) . to build the stacks , we first de - redshifted all individual observed spectra , then normalizing them to the tio@xmath1 continuum ( see next section ) .",
    "we calculated flux averages and errors in rest - frame wavelength bins of 10   .",
    "finally , we smoothed the stacks with a 20  boxcar kernel .",
    "the average snr per resolution element of the final stacked ( smoothed ) spectra is 70 ( 100 ) , 100 ( 140 ) around the tio@xmath1 absorption .",
    "the integrated spectral properties of a ssp are defined by four parameters : age , metallicity ( [ z / h ] ) , imf and @xmath36-elements over - abundance ( [ @xmath36/fe ] ) . in this letter , we analyze the tio@xmath1 absorption , an imf - sensitive feature which depends very weakly on [ z / h ] and [ @xmath36/fe ] @xcite .",
    "we present the age and imf constraints for z@xmath21 mqgs based on this tio@xmath1 spectral index as well as on the ultraviolet to near - infrared seds . in section  [ sec : dis ] , we discuss the impact of the unknown values of [ z / h ] and [ @xmath36/fe ] on our results . the tio@xmath1 absorption is wide and deep enough to be measured with wfc3 grism data .",
    "measurements for other imf - sensitive features ( see figures  [ data],[data2 ] ) would be compromised by low snr at @xmath37@xmath0500  nm , the low spectral resolution in the case of nad , or the proximity to emission features in the case of cah@xmath1 .",
    "thus , we concentrate our imf analysis on tio@xmath1 measurements .",
    "to constrain the age of the stellar population , we used three different methods .",
    "first , we fitted the g141 grism stacked spectra constrained to the rest - frame wavelength range 500@xmath0@xmath37@xmath0800  nm ( figures  [ data],[data2 ] ) .",
    "we used the ( * ? ? ? *",
    "hereafter bc03 ) models fed with the xmiles library ( charlot & bruzual , private communication ) .",
    "we assumed a ssp with solar and super - solar metallicities , and a @xcite attenuation law , and fitted the data to obtain ages , extinctions , and metallicities .",
    "we tested how the results were affected by : ( 1 ) using @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite imfs ; ( 2 ) different attenuation recipes , namely , @xcite , appropriate for starburst galaxies , and the more general law from @xcite ; and ( 3 ) different stellar population synthesis libraries and codes , namely , bc03 using xmiles and stelib@xcite libraries , and miuscat @xcite . in all cases , we found negligible differences in the estimated ages ( @xmath00.1  gyr ) and extinctions ( 0.1  mag ) .",
    "our fitting method included a montecarlo algorithm to analyze uncertainties and degeneracies ( see @xcite ) .",
    "given the short wavelength range probed by the grism data , the dust extinction was not well constrained .",
    "indeed , we found a strong age - extinction degeneracy .",
    "for example , for the high - mass stack , equally good fits were obtained for stellar populations with relatively young ages ( @xmath21 gyr ) and large extinctions ( a(v)@xmath31.5  mag ) and for older ages and lower extinctions ( 12  gyr and a(v)@xmath01  mag ) .",
    "constraining the extinction to a(v)@xmath01  mag , we found that the stacked high - mass spectrum was best fitted by a ssp with solar metallicity , t@xmath381.6@xmath60.2  gyr , and a(v)@xmath380.5@xmath60.3  mag .",
    "the low - mass stack was best fitted with solar metallicity , t@xmath381.0@xmath60.2  gyr , and a(v)@xmath380.7@xmath60.3  mag .",
    "our second age determination method used the whole uv - to - nir stacked sed ( figures  [ data ] , [ data2 ] ) .",
    "the shards medium - band and grism data allow accurate measurements of both the 4000   break and the mg@xmath39 absorption , two very good age estimators ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the wider spectral range resulted in better constraints on the age and the extinction .",
    "the best - fitting bc03/xmiles ssp model provided @xmath40@xmath381.77@xmath60.17  gyr , a(v)@xmath380.60@xmath60.06 , and @xmath40@xmath381.02@xmath60.15  gyr and a(v)@xmath380.70@xmath60.06 for the high - mass and low - mass samples , respectively ( solar metallicity in both cases ) .",
    "again , very similar results were obtained with other imfs , extinction recipes , and stellar population libraries . under an unrealistic assumption of a(v)@xmath380 ,",
    "the best - fitting ages were @xmath40@xmath381.5  gyr and @xmath40@xmath382.6  gyr for the low- and high - mass stacks , respectively .",
    "these solutions provide , based on the @xmath41 values , worse fits , and do not affect our main conclusions ( cf . section  [ sec : dis ] ) .    finally , we measured the stellar population ages fitting the whole uv - to - nir sed for each individual galaxy also using the montecarlo method , and calculating average properties for the low and high - mass sub - samples .",
    "these were remarkably and reassuringly similar ( within the uncertainties ) to the ones obtained with the other methods : t@xmath381.0@xmath60.2  gyr with a(v)@xmath380.9@xmath60.2  mag and t@xmath381.5@xmath60.3  gyr with a(v)@xmath380.9@xmath60.3  mag for the low - mass and high - mass samples , respectively .",
    "our age estimations are completely consistent with those obtained by @xcite using a stacked g141 grism spectrum around the h@xmath20 absorption also for @xmath17-selected mqgs , but at 1.4@xmath0z@xmath02.2 .",
    "they find ages between 0.9  gyr and 1.6  gyr for blue and red massive galaxies , very similar to the ranges we find for the our two sub - samples .",
    "consistent ages are also found for mqgs at z@xmath31 ( selected in a variety of ways and counting with heterogeneous data ) by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in summary , the ages of the @xmath17- and ssfr - selected z@xmath21 mqgs",
    "are confidently constrained to be  @xmath02  gyr .",
    "spectral region of the low- ( top ) and high - mass ( bottom ) stacks , as observed through the wfc3 g141 grism ( orange solid line ) .",
    "data points are compared to models ( smoothed to the same resolution ) with a bottom - heavy ( black histogram ) and a standard kroupa - like imfs ( gray ) .",
    "the observed spectra and models were normalized to the flux in the continuum bands ( gray shaded regions ) .",
    "ages were fixed to the results discussed in section  [ sec : age].,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    once average ages were determined , we proceeded to the imf analysis based on the tio@xmath1 absorption .",
    "given that this molecular band dominates the spectrum of cool - dwarf stars between 600 and 640  nm , it has been widely used to infer the imf slope in unresolved stellar systems @xcite .",
    "we used the miles ssp models @xcite , where the imf is parametrized as a single power law , truncated ( i.e. , flatted out ) for stellar masses below m@xmath00.6  m@xmath42 .",
    "this bimodal imf is completely described by a single parameter , @xmath43 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . under this parametrization , the kroupa ( 2001 ) imf",
    "is recovered for @xmath43@xmath381.3 .",
    "the main advantage of the bimodal imf , compared to a regular single power law ( salpeter - like ) imf , is the fact that , even when dealing with very high @xmath43 values , the @xmath44 ratio remains within the observational limits suggested by dynamical studies @xcite . from the point of view of the stellar population properties , both bimodal and uni - modal imf parametrizations are indistinguishable .",
    "miles models cover a range from @xmath45  dex to @xmath46  dex in metallicity , 0.06 gyr to 17  gyr in age , and @xmath43@xmath380.33.3 in imf slopes .",
    "given the weak dependence of the tio@xmath1 index with metallicity , we fixed it to solar ( as suggested by the sed fitting ) .",
    "the classical definition for the tio@xmath1 spectral index expands along @xmath2400   , making it extremely sensitive to the adopted flux calibration ( see section  5 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to improve the signal",
    ", we redefined the blue and red tio@xmath1 pseudo - continua , making them contiguous to the central bandpass .",
    "the adopted blue and red pseudo - continua are 613.0617.2  nm and 629.3634.5  nm , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : tio2 ] presents , for both stacks , the data and fits to the tio@xmath1 spectral region .",
    "the analysis of the tio@xmath1 absorption was based on fits to the six spectral elements ( p@xmath47 ) within the central band of our tio@xmath1 index definition , after removing the continuum .",
    "the models were degraded to the same spectral resolution ( p@xmath48 ) .",
    "the goodness of the fit was estimated with a @xmath41 function :    @xmath49 ^ 2}{\\sigma^2_\\mathrm{obs}(\\lambda ) } \\label{eq : chi}\\ ] ]    where @xmath50 represents the estimated error of the flux in each spectral bin .",
    "the @xmath41 maps in the age - imf slope plane for the low- and high - mass samples are shown in figure  [ fig : chi ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : chi ] shows our constraints on the stellar population age and imf slope for mqgs at z@xmath21 . as expected , there is a clear imf / age degeneracy : similar tio@xmath1 values are obtained by either an old population with a standard kroupa - like imf or with a steeper imf and younger ages . to further constrain the imf , we use the age determinations from the sed fitting .",
    "values in the imf slope vs. age plane for the low - mass ( top ) and the high - mass ( bottom ) samples .",
    "darker tones indicate more probable ssp solutions .",
    "the solid and dashed red lines enclose the 1- and 2-@xmath51 probability contours . dashed cyan regions mark the age range inferred from sed fitting .",
    "the combination of the tio@xmath1 index measurements and the stellar ages indicates that the imf of massive quiescent galaxies at z@xmath21 is bottom - heavy .",
    "for the low - mass galaxies , degeneracies are larger and the imf slope determination is significantly more uncertain.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    for the high - mass sample , figure  [ fig : chi ] shows that our age determination of 1.7@xmath60.3  gyr combined with the tio@xmath1 index measurements strongly suggest that the imf of m@xmath1210@xmath4  m@xmath5 mqgs at z@xmath21 is bottom - heavy .",
    "the imf slope is @xmath7=3.2@xmath60.2 , very similar to that measured for present - day early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "for the low - mass stack , considering a typical age of 1.0@xmath60.2  gyr , we find that the imf is flatter : @xmath10 .",
    "the uncertainty in this case is larger , mainly because the degeneracies between age and imf increase for younger ages and flatter imfs . using these imf values , and assuming a bimodal parametrization , the mass - limits of our stacks change to m@xmath310@xmath31m@xmath5 and 10@xmath52@xmath0m@xmath010@xmath31  m@xmath5 for the high- and low - mass stacks , respectively .",
    "although our age constraints are rather conservative ( see section  [ sec : age ] ) , an offset of 0.5  gyr in the lighter stack would leave the imf slope unconstrained below @xmath53 . such a large error in a 1  gyr old population is not expected , but the imf determination of this lighter stack should be considered more tentative than that for the massive stack . furthermore",
    ", low - mass galaxies tend to have more extended sfhs @xcite and therefore , their sed may be less well represented by a single ssp .",
    "note also that the departure from a ssp is expected to become larger if galaxies are observed closer to their formation age .",
    "this slightly extended star formation history in the lighter stack increases the scatter in the uv region , as shown in the upper left panel of figures  [ data],[data2 ] .",
    "in addition , at lower stellar masses the nature of galaxies becomes more heterogeneous , increasing the likelihood of having systems following different evolutionary tracks ( e.g. , disks and spheroids with different assembly histories maybe affecting the imf ) .",
    "two main caveats should be considered before further interpreting our data : the effect of @xmath36-element enhancement and metallicity .",
    "our fits do not account for non - solar @xmath36-elements abundances .",
    "massive galaxies exhibit an enhanced fraction of @xmath36-elements compared to the solar neighborhood , commonly interpreted as an imprint of a fast formation process @xcite .",
    "for a 1 - 2 gyr old population , an overabundance of @xmath21  dex in [ ti / fe ] would be needed to mimic the effect of a @xmath43@xmath383.2 imf @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite found an excess of only @xmath20.2  dex in [ ti / fe ] for massive galaxies at @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , unless the situation is totally different at high - z ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our tio@xmath1 measurement is unlikely to be explained with a standard imf plus a non - solar [ ti / fe ] abundance .",
    "the second caveat relates to the fact that we have used models with fixed solar metallicity .",
    "the effect of the metallicity on the tio@xmath1 line is very weak but not null . in this sense , we find steeper imfs when assuming larger metallicities .",
    "however , neither our sed fits , nor z@xmath20 massive galaxies @xcite suggest a strong departure from solar metallicity . on the contrary , an overestimation of the actual metallicity would weakly mimic the effect of a step imf slope on the tio@xmath1 feature .",
    "however , sub - solar metallicities can be ruled out considering that galaxies as massive as those in our sample , show almost no metallicity evolution since @xmath55 @xcite , being metal - rich at @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "thus , our results are robust against a poor metallicity determination .    in a more qualitative way , in figure",
    "[ fig : rela ] we compare our results with the imf slope vs. velocity dispersion relation found in the nearby universe @xcite .",
    "we have translated our stellar mass scale to velocity dispersion using individual measurements for our galaxies and statistical properties for samples at the same redshift and selected in similar way .",
    "based on measurements found in the literature ( mainly in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for galaxies with similar masses at similar redshifts , we obtain an average velocity dispersion of 252@xmath610  kms@xmath14 and 208@xmath68  kms@xmath14 for our high- and low - mass stacks , respectively .",
    "in addition , individual velocity dispersions have been measured for two galaxies contributing to our low - mass stacked spectrum @xcite .",
