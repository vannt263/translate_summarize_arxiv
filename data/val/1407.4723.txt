    "the task of keyword extraction is to automatically identify a set of terms that best describe the document @xcite .",
    "automatic keyword extraction establishes foundation for various natural language processing applications : information retrieval , automatic indexing and classification of documents , automatic summarization , high - level semantic description , etc .",
    "state - of - the - art keyword extraction approaches are based on statistical methods which require learning from hand - annotated data sets . in the last decade focus of research",
    "has shifted toward unsupervised methods , mainly toward network or graph enabled keyword extraction . in a network",
    "based keyword extraction the document representation may vary from very simple ( words are nodes and their co - occurrence is represented with links ) , or can incorporate very sophisticated linguistic knowledge like syntactic @xcite or semantic relations @xcite .",
    "typically , the source ( document , text , data ) for keyword extraction is modelled with one network . this way , both the statistical properties ( frequencies ) as well as the structure of source text",
    "are represented by unique formal representation , hence complex network .    network ( or graph , since the number of words in isolated documents is limited ) enabled keyword extraction exploits different measures for the task of identification and ranking of the most representative features of the source - the keywords .",
    "the keyword extraction powered by network measures can be on the node , network or subnetwork level .",
    "measures on the node level are : degree , strength , centrality @xcite ; on the network level : coreness , clustering coefficient , pagerank motivated ranking score or hits motivated hub and authority score @xcite@xcite@xcite ; on the subnetwork level : communities @xcite .",
    "majority of the research was motivated with various centrality measures : degree , betweenness , closeness and eigenvector centrality @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "our research aims at proposing an unsupervised method for keyword extraction in croatian language .",
    "since , croatian is a highly flective slavic language , usually source text needs a substantial preprocessing ( lemmatization  morphological normalization , stopwords removal , part - of - speech ( pos ) annotation , morphosyntactic descriptions ( msd)tagging , etc . )",
    ", we design our approach with light or no linguistic knowledge . a new network measure - the node selectivity , originally proposed by masucci and",
    "rodgers @xcite @xcite ( which that can distinguish a real from a shuffled network ) , is applied to automatic keyword extraction .",
    "selectivity is defined as the average weight distribution on the links of the single node . in our previous work , the node selectivity measure performed in favour of differentiation between original and shuffled croatian texts @xcite@xcite , and for differentiation of blog and literature text genres @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the node selectivity measure was not applied to keyword extraction task before .",

    "the set is divided : 960 annotated documents for learning of supervised methods , and 60 documents for testing .",
    "the test set of 60 documents is annotated by 8 different experts , where the inter - annotator agreement in terms of f2 scores ( see section 6 ) are in average 46% ( between 29.3% and 66.1% ) .",
    "we selected the first 30 texts from the hina collection for our preliminary experiment .",
    "the texts required some preprocessing : parsing only textual part and title part excluding annotations , cleaning of diacritics and symbols ( w instead vv , ! instead l , etc . ) and lemmatization .",
    "non - standard word forms numbers , dates , acronyms , abbreviations etc .",
    "remain in text , since the method is preferably resistant to the noise presented in the data source .",
    "the selected 30 texts varied in the length : from very short 60 tokens up to 800 tokens ( 318 tokens in average ) .",
    "text can be represented as a complex network of linked words : each individual word is a node and interactions amongst words are links .",
    "co - occurrence networks exploit simple neighbour relation , two words are linked if they are adjacent in the sentence @xcite .",
    "the weight of the link is proportional to the overall co - occurrence frequencies of the corresponding word pairs within a corpus . for each document in hina",
    "dataset we construct one directed and weighted co - occurence network , 30 in total .",
    "network construction and analysis was implemented with the python programming language using the networkx software package developed for the creation , manipulation , and study of the structure , dynamics , and functions of complex networks @xcite .",
    "selectivity is a local ( node level ) network measures . in weighted and directed co - occurrence networks one can consider the in- and out- links for obtaining in / out selectivity of the node ( eq.8 ) .    in the first part of our experiment we compute in / out selectivity for all nodes in all 30 networks .",
    "the nodes are ranked according to the highest in / out selectivity values above threshold value . preserving the same threshold value ( @xmath22 1 ) in all documents resulted in different number of nodes ( one word long keyword candidates ) extracted per each network . obtained set of one word long keyword candidates",
    "is noted as set1 .",
    "then , for every filtered node we detect neighbouring nodes : for the in - selecti - vity we isolate one neighbour node with the highest outgoing weight ; for the out - selectivity we isolate one neighbour node with the highest ingoing weight .",
    "the result of in / out selectivity extraction is a set of ranked words - tuples - set2 .",
    "words - tuples are two words long sequences of keyword candidates . from obtained tuples we filtered out those containing stopwords in order to compare with the manually annotated evaluation set .",
    "for the keyword extraction task the strategy `` more is better '' can be utilized , since there is no objective judgement on keywords .",
    "hence , it is preferable to extract more keywords which makes trade off between precision and recall of the methods . the second polemic issue of keyword extraction task is : shorter keywords are more general vs. longer which are more accurate .",
    "motivated by this open arguments , and by the approach of other authors , we decided to follow the same principle : to extract as many as possible keyword candidates and evaluate them on the basis of recall ( @xmath23 ) and @xmath1 score , beside the standard precision ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath0 score .",
    "@xmath0 score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall : @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath1 measure gives two times as much importance to recall as to precision : @xmath26 .",
    "evaluation is the final part of the experiment based on the intersection of the obtained sets set1 and set2 of keyword candidates with the union of all 8 annotators keywords .",
    "the results in terms of precision and recall are in figures 1 and 2 respectively , and in terms of @xmath0 and @xmath1 scores in figures 3 and 4 respectively .",
    "obtained average @xmath0 score for the set 1 is 24,63% , and average @xmath1 score is 21,19% .",
    "expansion of obtained candidates to set2 increased average @xmath0 score to 25,9% and @xmath1 score to 24,47% .",

    "the evaluation set was reduced to keywords suggested only by 3 top annotators ( have the highest inter - annotator agreement among all 8 annotators ) .",

    "our method achieved on a set1 average recall of 19,53% and precision of 39,1% .",
    "expansion to the words - tuples in set2 increased average recall to 23,87% and decreased precision to 32,23% .",
    "obtained results are comparable to @xcite and @xcite , but with slightly different evaluation set up .",
    "the preliminary results are promising and have potential to improve in several directions which is elaborated at the end of the next section .",
    "additional remark regarding results , is that beside keyword candidates our method captures personal names and entities , which were not marked as keyphrases and lowered the score .",
    "capturing names and entities can be of high relevance for the tasks like name - entity recognition , text summarization , etc .",
    "keyword annotation is an extremely subjective task as even human experts have difficulties to agree upon keyphrases ( inter - agreement around 40% ) .",
    "croatian is highly morphologically rich language , which puts another magnitude of challenge on the task , since annotators are freely choosing morphological word form as tag , which seems appropriate at the moment .",
    "additionally , there was no predefined set of index or keywords list , so annotators could make up their own , even worse in some cases it seemed appropriate to annotate with keywords , which were not present in the original article ( out - of - vocabulray words ) . in @xcite the number of out - of - vocabulary keywords on the whole hina dataset",
    "is estimated to high 57% . since our method",
    "is derived from purely text statistics , it is not capable to capture all possible subjective variations of annotators .",

    "the node selectivity value is used for extraction nad ranking of keyword candidates .",
    "furthermore , we expand extracted nodes to words - tuples with the highest in / out selectivity values .",
    "selectivity - based extraction does not require linguistic knowledge while it is purely derived from statistical and structural information encompassed in the source text which is reflected into the structure of the network .",
    "obtained average @xmath0 score for the set of extracted keyword candidates is 24,63% , and average @xmath1 score is 21,19% .",
    "expansion of obtained candidates to words - tuples increased average @xmath0 score to 25,9% and @xmath1 score to 24,47% , which is comparable to the results on the same dataset achieved by supervised and unsupervised methods .",
    "our results imply that the structure of the network can be applied on croatian keyword extraction task with many possible improvements .",
    "this should be thoroughly examined in the future work , which will cover : a ) evaluation - consider all flective word forms ; consider different matching strategies - exact , fuzzy , partof match ; b ) text types - consider texts of different length , genre and topics ; c ) multitopic - compare isolate document extraction vs. multitopic extraction ( one network constructed for the whole collection ) ; d ) other languages - test on standard english ( and other ) datasets ; e ) compare with other centrality motivated extraction approaches ; f ) longer keywords candidate sets - construct keyword sequences up to length 3 ; g ) entity extraction - test weather entities can be extracted from complex networks .",
