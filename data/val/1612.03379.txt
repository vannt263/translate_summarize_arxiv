    "the initial mark in the investigation of billiards theory is related to birkhoff @xcite in beginning of last century . since",
    "then this research area has developed significantly .",
    "birkoff considered the investigation of the motion of a free point - like particle  representing a billiard ball  in a bounded manifold .",
    "however the modern investigations of billiards are indeed related to the results of sinai @xcite and bunimovich @xcite who made rigorous demonstrations on the topic .",
    "a billiard is a dynamical system composed of a particle , or an ensemble of non interacting particles , moving confined to a domain with a piecewise - smooth boundary @xcite where they collide .",
    "the specular reflections occur under the condition the boundary is sufficiently smooth . in such case",
    "the tangent component of the velocity of the particle measured with respect to the border where collision happened is unchanged while the normal component reverses sign .",
    "there are many results nowadays considering either static @xcite and time dependent boundaries @xcite .",
    "a phenomenon well known in time dependent boundary is the fermi acceleration @xcite as well as the so called loskutov - ryabov - akinshin ( lra ) conjecture @xcite .",
    "fermi acceleration @xcite is a phenomenon where an ensemble of particles acquires unlimited energy from collisions with an infinitely heavy and moving wall .",
    "the conjecture itself claims that if chaos is present in the dynamics of a particle in a static version of the billiard , then this is a sufficient  but not necessary  condition to observe fermi acceleration when a time perturbation to the boundary is introduced .",
    "many different billiards exhibit fermi acceleration under time perturbation to the boundary including the lorentz gas @xcite , oval billiard @xcite , stadium @xcite and other shapes @xcite .",
    "the elliptical billiard is an exception and the lra conjecture does not apply to it . for the static boundary ,",
    "the elliptical billiard is integrable @xcite and the phase space is composed of rotating and librating orbits .",
    "a curve which separates these two different regimes is called as separatrix .",
    "lenz et al .",
    "@xcite shown that when the boundary of the billiard is allowed to be time dependent , the separatix curve is replaced by a stochastic layer allowing cross visitations from regions of libration and rotation .",
    "for the static case both energy , @xmath0 , and angular momenta about the two foci , @xmath1 , are constants of motion @xcite , leading the system to be integrable . however ,",
    "when time perturbation is introduced , the observable @xmath1 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) experiences strong and fast variations from the crossing of orbits coming from rotation and those leaving from libration .",
    "the successive crossings produce the stochasticity required in the lra conjecture , hence leading the time dependent elliptical billiard to exhibit fermi acceleration .",
    "this result is considered a counter example of the lra conjecture .",
    "latter on , investigations on different models have proved the fermi acceleration is not a robust phenomenon since a very small amount of dissipation is enough to suppress the phenomenon @xcite .",
    "consideration of inelastic collisions in the elliptical billiard @xcite has proved the successive crossings of orbits coming from rotation region and entering libration domain  and vice versa  are interrupted suppressing the fermi acceleration .",
    "the motion of the time dependent boundary can be related to a more physical situation . due to the thermal fluctuations",
    "the position of each atom that compose the boundary is allowed to move locally .",
    "such oscillation of the atoms , and hence of the boundary , can be brought to the context of billiard which allows connections of the observables obtained from the velocity of the particle  hence the kinetic energy  to the thermodynamics , particularly the temperature and entropy .    in this paper",
    "we investigate some dynamical properties for an ensemble of particles confined in an oval billiard whose boundary is moving in time .",
    "our main goal is to understand and describe the dynamics of the average squared velocity for a gas of noninteracting particles .",
    "we will do this by using two different procedures . because the boundary of the billiard is moving , as soon as the particles collide",
    ", there is a change of energy of the particle .",
    "therefore , the first procedure considered involves the heat transfer fourier equation .",
    "we write and solve the fourier equation considering the geometrical properties of the boundary .",
    "the resulting equation is that the temperature of the gas settles down for sufficiently long time as the temperature of the boundary , hence the average squared velocity , reaches the thermal equilibrium .",
    "the second one involves the formalism commonly used in billiard problems .",
    "we write down the equations of the mapping that describe the dynamics of the problem and extract some average properties for the squared velocity of the particles .",
    "the properties are obtained either by straightforward numerical simulations as well as analytically .",
    "the results obtained on the analytical approach are remarkable well fitted by the numerical simulations .",
    "the first approach however uses the time as the dynamical variable while the second one uses the number of collisions of the particles with the boundary .",
    "the two dynamical variables are not trivially connected among themselves .",
    "therefore , by the use of an empirical function , we find a straight relation between these two parameters .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we discuss the properties of the average squared velocity by the use of heat transfer fourier equation .",
    "we use some geometrical properties of the boundary to fit into the required parameters of the equation .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is devoted to construct the billiards approach of the problem .",
    "we them obtain the equations that describe the dynamics of the model and discuss the several types of characterization including steady state , dynamical regime , numerical simulations , critical exponents and the behavior of the probability distribution function for the velocity of the particles .",
    "the connection of the two parts is made in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] where a relation between the time and number of collisions is obtained . conclusions and discussions are made in sec .",
    "we discuss in this section the approach involving heat transfer . to start with",
    "we assume that there is a set of identical particles moving inside a closed boundary .",
    "the density of the particles is considered sufficiently small such that the particles are noninteracting .",
    "figure [ fig1](a ) shows an illustration of the system .",
    "we assume the boundary of the billiard is moving in time , therefore , this is the mechanism responsible for the exchange of energy with the particles : collisions !",
    "the boundary is at a temperature @xmath2 that is considered fixed and does not change with the dynamics of the particles . hence the boundary works as a thermal bath and two obvious conclusions can be extracted .",
    "if the temperature of the gas of particles is less than @xmath2 , then the boundary gives energy to the particles raising up the temperature of the gas .",
    "on the other hand , if the temperature of the particles is larger than @xmath2 , the heat bath absorbs energy from the particles and dissipate it along with the chain of nearby atoms of the boundary  hence reducing the temperature of the gas .",
    "there is a region near the border of the billiard where the particles can exchange energy which we denote as a collision region .",
    "the hamiltonian that describes the dynamics of each particle is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 corresponds to the momentum of the particle and @xmath5 is the potential energy which is written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the radius of the boundary written in polar coordinates , which assumes the following form in this work @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is any integer number .",
    "a non integer number leads to an open boundary to where the particles can escape .",
    "@xmath10 is a parameter which controls the circle perturbation . if @xmath11 , the boundary is a circle , that is integrable @xcite , in billiards terminology , due to the conservation of energy and angular momentum , while @xmath12 leads the phase space to be mixed when @xmath13 is a constant @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath13 leads to the time perturbation of the boundary and we consider in this work two different types of perturbation : ( i ) periodic oscillations and ; ( ii ) random oscillations . for case ( i )",
    "the function is written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the amplitude of oscillation and @xmath16 is the angular frequency , which we set it as fixed @xmath17 .",
    "for the random case ( ii ) , the function @xmath13 assumes the same expression as in the case ( i ) however , at the instant of the impact , we assume there is a random phase @xmath18 , given random numbers @xmath19 $ ] , such that the velocity of the moving boundary is given by @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "this choice is made in such a way to avoid the possibility of having the chance of the particles moving outside of the boundary , hence a non physical situation . at the same time , this is an easy way to introduce randomness in the model . in this section",
    "we discuss the thermodynamical properties based on the heat transfer equation  fourier law  and the geometrical parameters of the boundary will be used in the approach . in next section",
    "we describe the dynamics by using the billiards formalism hence writing the dynamical equations of the particle and averaging the velocity as a function of the number of collisions as well as along an ensemble of particles .",
    "the equation that governs the heat transference @xcite is written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 corresponds to the heat conductivity coefficient , @xmath23 is length along the boundary to where the heat can flow and is obtained from the geometrical properties of the boundary , @xmath24 denotes the flux of heat from a region where there is a temperature difference @xmath25 and @xmath26 corresponds to the temperature gradient .",
    "we present a short discussion of the fourier equation in appendix 1 and an interpretation of the heat conductivity coefficient @xmath22 for the one - dimensional case .",
    "the minus @xmath27 is related to the fact the heat flow from the region of higher to the lower temperature , hence opposite to the temperature gradient @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1](b ) illustrates schematically the collision zone and the region to where heat can flow .",
    "the effective length @xmath23 to where heat can flow is obtained from @xmath28\\cos(p\\theta)]d\\theta=2\\pi$ ] .",
    "the two steps we consider to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) is to obtain the corresponding expressions for : ( i ) @xmath24 and ; ( ii ) @xmath26 in such a way that its solution can be obtained .",
    "we know that the density of particles is considered sufficiently small so that each particle does not interact with any other . therefore , the energy of each particle is due to the energy associated to the state of its motion , hence kinetic energy . from the energy equipartition theorem",
    "we have that @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath31 corresponds to the squared average velocity averaged over the ensemble of particles .",
    "the knowledge of @xmath31 directly gives the temperature @xmath32 .",
    "we know from the thermodynamics @xcite that an amount of heat transferred in a process depends on the temperature @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is an infinitesimal amount of heat transferred at the price of an infinitesimal variation @xmath35 in the temperature .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 corresponds to the heat capacity of the gas of particles . for an ideal gas @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the total number of particles in the gas @xcite . with these we have the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) is written as @xmath39 .",
    "the next step is to obtain the expression of the right side of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "since the temperature gradient can only happen along the collision zone , we can consider an approximation that @xmath40 where @xmath41 is measured along the collision zone . to obtain @xmath41",
    "we note that the radius of the boundary can assume two extrema : @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 correspond to the maximum and minimum values of the radius when time varies .",
    "the collision zone then is a region given by @xmath46 .",
    "we see that @xmath47 is not constant being dependent directly on @xmath48 and has the property that @xmath49 .",
