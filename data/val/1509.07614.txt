    "modern quantum technologies harness characteristic features of quantum systems to gain performance that is otherwise unattainable through classical means .",
    "this progress ultimately relies on the ability to create , manipulate , and measure quantum states .",
    "all of these tasks require a step - by - step verification in the experimental procedures ; this is essentially the scope of quantum tomography  @xcite .    typically , a tomographic protocol attempts to infer the unknown quantum state from the distinct outcomes of a collection of measurements performed on a finite set of identical copies of the system . with these limited resources ,",
    "the choice of optimal measurements and the design of efficient reconstruction algorithms are crucial .",
    "when the measurement outcomes form an informationally complete set  @xcite , the data obtained contain maximal information and a unique state estimator can be inferred .",
    "unfortunately , as we probe more intricate quantum systems  @xcite , such an informationally complete set of measurements becomes extremely difficult to implement .",
    "in addition , the complete knowledge of the quantum state of a system with many degrees of freedom is usually not needed , as one could very well be interested in a few parameters only , such as the fidelity with respect a target state or a measure of entanglement .",
    "we are thus inevitably led to the consideration of alternative techniques . a promising class of new protocols are explicitly optimized for particular kinds of states .",
    "this includes states with low rank  @xcite , such as matrix product states @xcite , or multi - scale entanglement renormalization ansatz states  @xcite .",
    "the specific but pertinent example of permutation invariance was also examined  @xcite .    in the same spirit , several algorithms for estimating quantum states from incomplete measurement data have been reported recently  @xcite . here , we revisit the problem in the context of mutually unbiased ( mu ) measurements , which are known to be optimal for state reconstruction  @xcite if a complete set of bases is to be measured . at the fundamental level , mutually unbiased bases ( mub )",
    "are part of the mathematical framework for an explicit formalism of the complementarity principle .",
    "the idea emerged in the pioneering work of schwinger  @xcite , and has since been integrated into the foundation of quantum theory : apart from their role in tomography , mub are instrumental in addressing a number of enthralling questions  @xcite .    a first , self - suggesting , if naive , approach could be to assume a uniform distribution for the outcomes of the unmeasured bases from a set of mub , as this seems to be consistent with the very physical nature of mub , which minimize the statistical uncertainty hypervolumes .",
    "however , as we show here , this is often incompatible with the positivity required by quantum mechanics , and even when the resulting estimator is physical , it is usually not the estimator with the largest von neumann entropy  @xcite .",
    "the bases of eigenstates of complementary observables are called _ unbiased _ because we can not predict at all the outcome of a projective measurement in one basis if the system is prepared in a state from another basis  all outcomes are equally probable , there is no preference in our prediction .",
    "this notion of being unbiased must not be confused with other uses of the adjective .",
    "in fact , there are many different meanings and connotations associated with `` bias '' : statistical bias , bias in a sample , cultural bias , and media bias are but a few uses of the word .    in the context of state estimation ,",
    "_ statistical bias _ is of some importance ; an estimator has a statistical bias if its average over all thinkable compositions of a finite sample of measurement results deviates from the true value .",
    "this will be of no concern here because we shall take for granted that the measured sample is so large that statistical noise in the data can be safely ignored . also , we do not have to worry about a _ biased sample _ , a common problem when polls are taken .",
    "the simple `` estimators of unbiased linear inversion , '' which we shall introduce in sec .",
    "[ sec:2c ] , are unbiased in the sense that they assume equal probability for all outcomes of the unmeasured bases from a set of mub ; they are , however , estimators with a statistical bias ( for data from a finite sample ) , a property that can not be avoided  @xcite if one insists , as we do , that all permissible estimators are physical  they must be _ bona fide _ density operators . as noted in the preceding paragraph ,",
    "the statistical bias is irrelevant in the current context , and it is worth recalling that , despite the negative connotation of `` bias , '' a statistical bias is not only harmless , but can be rather beneficial ( see jaynes s discussion in sections 17.2 and 17.3 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    regarding _ cultural bias _ and _ media bias _ , we are confident that we do not suffer from the former and hope that we will not be a victim of the latter . may bias , melampus s brother and pero s and iphianassa s husband ( consecutively ) , guard this work against biased judgment .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . after introducing background material and notational conventions in sec .",
    "[ sec : background ] , we illustrate various aspects of the said self - suggesting approach in sec .",
    "[ sec : ulinexamples ] , with particular emphasis on unphysical properties of the resulting estimators .",
    "we conclude that the `` estimators of unbiased linear inversion '' are often unphysical  they are _ not _ estimators .",
    "then , in sec .  [ sec : least - bias ] , we introduce a natural alternative that keeps these estimators whenever they are physical and , when they are not , replaces them with physical estimators . rather than being unbiased about the probabilities of unmeasured bases , the physical estimators are minimally biased .",
    "in this alternative approach , we maximize the shannon entropy with due attention to the physical constraints and so minimize the bias .",
    "this entails a simple optimization algorithm over the state space , in which a single equation is iterated . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lbcomp ] , we consider alternatives to maximizing the shannon entropy . some of them minimize the bias with respect to another criterion , others are characterized in a different way .",
    "finally , we offer a summary and conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : con ] .",
    "the state of a @xmath0-dimensional quantum system is specified by a positive semidefinite , unit - trace density operator @xmath1 .",
    "carefully note that a different symbol @xmath2 is reserved for its @xmath3 matrix representation , which requires @xmath4 independent real parameters for its complete characterization .",
    "if a von neumann maximal test is chosen to fix @xmath5 of these parameters , then a total of @xmath6 tests is necessary to reconstruct the state .",
    "this strategy is optimal when the bases in which the measurements are carried out are `` as different as possible ; '' that is , when these bases are mu  @xcite .    throughout this paper , we take the dimension @xmath0 to be a prime or a prime - power integer .",
    "then , a maximal number of @xmath7 mub  @xcite exist and can be explicitly constructed  @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath8 the @xmath9th ket in the @xmath10th basis of the set of mub ; here and below , greek indices ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ,  ) label the @xmath12 distinct mub , whereas latin indices ( @xmath9 , @xmath13 ,  ) label the @xmath0 outcomes in each basis .",
    "we define mu projectors as @xmath14 .",
    "any two mu projectors satisfy the trace relation @xmath15 that states their orthonormality for @xmath16 and their mutual unbiasedness for @xmath17 .",
    "besides , these projectors constitute a complete set of projective measurements for each @xmath10 , @xmath18    to facilitate the discussion of the physics behind incomplete mub tomography , the number of copies of the system probed by the measurement apparatus is taken sufficiently large , so statistical fluctuations in the measurement data are negligible .    the problem we are studying here is , therefore , not one of state estimation _ sensu stricto _ , where the estimation of the probabilities from observed relative frequencies is the central theme .",
    "rather , we are dealing with the problem of converting the probabilities into a statistical operator , which requires a deliberate choice when the tomography is incomplete .",
    "the @xmath19 measured probabilities @xmath20 which obey the @xmath7 constraints @xmath21 , fully characterize the density operator @xmath1 of the system .",
    "first , if only one basis is measured ",
    "the @xmath10th basis , say  our state estimator is @xmath22 it is the most natural estimator , inasmuch as we estimate the probabilities of the unmeasured bases in the unbiased manner of @xmath23 for @xmath24 ; this is most adequate for mub if we are mindful of laplace s advice to assign equal probabilities to alternatives about which we have no information @xcite .",
    "second , after measuring all @xmath7 bases , we know the density operator completely , @xmath25 alternatively , we write @xmath26 while the mappings @xmath27 and @xmath28 are linear , the mappings @xmath29 in eqs .   or appear to be affine .",
    "in fact , these are linear mappings too , since we can make use of identities such as @xmath30    { w_{\\alpha k } } & = & { \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1}p_{\\alpha j }    \\left   ( \\delta_{jk}-\\frac{1}{d } \\right ) } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we wish .",
    "here is a caveat .",
    "the linear map @xmath31 in for a single basis continues to yield physical estimators if one replaces the probabilities @xmath32 by the corresponding relative frequencies from an experiment with a finite sample .",
    "the resulting single - basis estimators have no statistical bias .",
    "for the full tomography , however , one can not replace the probabilities in by relative frequencies .",
    "if one does , one gets mock estimators that have no statistical bias but are unphysical , whereas physical estimators are statistically biased since they require a suitable nonlinear mapping from the relative frequencies to estimated probabilities",
    ". see refs .",
    "@xcite for various aspects of these matters .",
    "the second version of eq .   exploits a well - known important geometrical property of density operators : the difference between any @xmath1 and the completely mixed state @xmath33 is a traceless hermitian operator , and these operators are elements of a @xmath34 real vector space .",
    "the sum over @xmath10 in eq .   or is a sum over hyperplanes in this vector space ; there are @xmath7 of them , each @xmath35-dimensional since @xmath36 .",
    "the hyperplanes are orthogonal in the sense of @xmath37 and in @xmath38 & = & \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{d+1}\\sum_{k=0}^{d-1 } ( w_{\\alpha k}-w_{\\alpha k}^{\\prime } ) ^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we recognize the euclidean metric of the vector space .",
    "the single - basis estimator in eq .   is obtained from the right - hand side of eq .   by setting @xmath39 for the basis indices @xmath11 that are different from the privileged index @xmath10",
    "now , if an intermediate number of bases from the set of mub has been measured  say , the first @xmath40 bases with @xmath41the unbiasedness of the bases and the linearity just noted suggest to set @xmath42 for the @xmath43 unmeasured bases , which yields the @xmath40th estimator of _ unbiased linear inversion _ ( ulin ) , @xmath44 we can also regard the truncation of the @xmath10 summation as effected by a replacement of the coefficients @xmath45 in eq .   in accordance with @xmath46    yet , irrespective of how we regard the map of the measured probabilities @xmath32 with @xmath47 onto the ulin estimator @xmath48 , the map simply amounts to estimating the probabilities of the unmeasured bases in the unbiased manner ",
    "faithful to laplace s advice , so to say : @xmath49 all other estimators are characterized by the non - zero operator they assign to the unmeasured part in @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the estimator for the contribution of the unmeasured bases to the sums in eqs .   and .",
    "before proceeding , six comments are in order .",
    "first , the map @xmath52 projects @xmath53 onto the span of the first @xmath40 hyperplanes in the vector space discussed above ; applying the map a second time has no effect .",
    "this projection property implies @xmath54 for any two density operators @xmath1 and @xmath55 .",
    "second , we note that , since eq .   involves only the measured bases , it is also well defined for systems where @xmath40 mub exist , but this set can not be extended to @xmath12 bases .",
    "this is the case , e.g. , for @xmath56 and @xmath57 where only sets of at most three mub have been found thus far  @xcite .",
    "there are also non - extendable sets for prime - power dimensions  @xcite , although ulin estimators for these sets suffer from the same problems as the ulin estimators for subsets of full sets ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : ulinexamples ] ) : they are often unphysical .    also , whether the unmeasured bases are pairwise unbiased among themselves , or unbiased with some of the measured bases , is not important for the maximum property of the following third comment , nor for the physical least - bias estimators of secs .",
    "[ sec : lbphilo ] and [ sec : lbcomp-1 ] .",
    "if one wishes , one can choose the unmeasured bases such that they have largest average distance ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , so that they resemble a set of mub as best as they can .",
    "third , it is also worth noting that , of all estimators consistent with the measured probabilities , the ulin estimator @xmath48 maximizes the shannon entropy @xmath58 associated with the unmeasured probabilities , which must be calculated according to eq .  .",
    "the ulin estimator has this property by construction , since it gives the uniform estimates of eq .   for the @xmath59s .    for simplicity",
    ", we are taking some liberties with the shannon entropy in : the probabilities are normalized to unit sum for each @xmath11 , rather than to total unit sum and we are using the natural rather than the binary logarithm .",
    "this betrayal of the pure doctrine is of no consequence , however .",
    "fourth , irrespective of the unbiased way of estimating the @xmath59s , the ulin estimator has a statistical bias ; recall the pertinent remarks in the introduction .",
    "fifth , as we shall see , after measuring @xmath40 bases , we actually have some information about the @xmath43 unmeasured bases .",
    "we are not really faithful to laplace s advice as long as we do not account for this information properly .",
    "for @xmath60 we recover the estimator  ( [ eq : bm-1 ] ) with @xmath61 , whereas @xmath62 is the full - tomography case of @xmath63 in eq .  .",
    "the reliability of @xmath48 for these limiting values of @xmath40 is , however , misleading , and so is the self - suggesting probability estimation  ( [ eq : bm-5 ] ) .",
    "as we shall see  and this is one main objective of this work ",
    "the ulin estimator is not assuredly physical for intermediate @xmath40 values , except in the qubit situation of @xmath64 .",
    "that is , @xmath65 is possible .",
    "the correct implementation of laplace s advice is not achieved by the simple - minded estimates in .",
    "sixth , there is no other linear map @xmath66 that could be used instead of @xmath67 if we require for consistency , as we must , that @xmath68 for the @xmath40 bases that have been measured .",
    "there are , of course , legitimate state estimators @xmath69 that are consistent with the known probabilities for bases @xmath70namely the physical `` other '' estimators of eq .",
    "and these estimators make up a convex set ; correspondingly , there is a convex set of estimated probabilities @xmath59 for @xmath71 .",
    "the ulin estimator of eq .   and the unbiasedly estimated probabilities @xmath72 may or may not be in the respective sets . when they are outside , we have to choose the best state estimator in accordance with a suitable optimality criterion .",
    "more about this in sec .",
    "[ sec : least - bias ] .",
    "as a first illustration , let us take the elementary example of a single qubit ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the three mub here are just the eigenstates of the standard pauli operators @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , so that @xmath77 ,  , @xmath78 and @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the three - dimensional bloch vector with , e.g. ,",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath1 are @xmath82 , and the von neumann entropy @xmath83 grows monotonously with shrinking bloch - vector length  @xmath84 .",
    "when a single basis is measured ( @xmath60 ) , say that of @xmath74 , only @xmath85 is known , and we have @xmath86 clearly , this physical estimator maximizes the von neumann entropy , since @xmath87 give the shortest bloch vector consistent with the known probabilities @xmath88 .",
    "likewise , the ulin estimator for two measured bases , @xmath89 which gives the estimated probabilities @xmath90 for the unmeasured @xmath76 , maximizes the von neumann entropy regardless of the values for the observed probabilities @xmath91 and  @xmath92 .",
    "these properties of the ulin estimators for a qubit are consequences of the simple spherical geometry of the bloch ball and the orthogonality of the planes corresponding to the distinct single - qubit mu pauli observables .",
    "such lines of argument were employed for justifying the optimality of mub tomography in higher dimensions  @xcite : when picturing the results obtained with a finite number of copies using `` fuzzy '' hyperplanes , their mutual orthogonality makes the uncertainty hypervolume particularly small .",
    "so , for a qubit , the unbiased unmeasured probabilities of the ulin estimator , as quantified by the shannon entropy , optimize ( maximize ) the von neumann entropy , much like the unbiased mu observables optimize ( minimize ) statistical uncertainty .",
    "these two properties complement each other .",
    "in fact , for any @xmath93 and @xmath40 , if @xmath1 is equal to a projector @xmath94 of one of the measured bases , then the ulin estimator is the state itself according to the defining relation  . in view of all this evidence , one might expect this mutual compatibility to extend to higher dimensions  and so arrive at the ulin estimator of eq .  .",
    "however , we shall see that this somewhat naive approach fails for @xmath95 .      for the @xmath96 case of a qutrit",
    ", we use this set of four mub : @xmath97 where the columns are the probability amplitudes of the basis kets with reference to the fourth basis , and @xmath98 is the basic cubic root of unity .",
    "the @xmath99 matrices that represent the respective single - basis estimators of eq .",
    "are @xmath100 where @xmath101 we have @xmath102 for the probabilities in terms of the @xmath103s , and the unitary @xmath99 matrices for the pairwise complementary observables @xmath104 are @xmath105 we note that @xmath106 , and the replacement @xmath107 for an unmeasured basis is here simply implemented by @xmath108 .",
    "consider now a qutrit state for which the density operator is an incoherent mixture of two projectors , one each from the first and the second bases , @xmath109 with @xmath110 . as an immediate consequence of @xmath111 , we have here @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 .",
    "it follows that @xmath115 , so that all ulin estimators are genuine density operators for this particular  @xmath1 .",
    "matters are quite different for @xmath116 for which @xmath117 and @xmath118 ; all @xmath119s have eigenvalues @xmath120 .",
    "while @xmath121 and @xmath122 are density operators , as they are always , here @xmath123 and @xmath124 are not acceptable estimators ; they have negative determinants of @xmath125 and @xmath126 , respectively .",
    "the last example illustrates the statement in sec .",
    "[ sec:2c ] that `` the ulin estimator is not assuredly physical for intermediate @xmath40 values , '' here for @xmath127 .",
    "analogous examples can be constructed for higher dimensions ; see sec .",
    "[ sec : qudit ] . regarding the other assertion in sec .",
    "[ sec:2c] that there is no consistent `` linear map @xmath128 that could be used instead of @xmath67''we shall now argue that one gets a contradiction when assuming that there is such a map .",
    "for this purpose , we look specifically at the case of @xmath129 , but the argument can clearly be modified for other dimensions @xmath95 and other intermediate @xmath40 values .",
    "suppose we have measured the probabilities of bases @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 but lack data for basis @xmath133 . then we know the values of @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 , which determine all off - diagonal elements in @xmath137 , and we need a linear ( or affine ) map @xmath138 for the estimation of the diagonal matrix elements . as an immediate consequence of the linearity",
    ", we note that convex sums of @xmath139 values yield respective convex sums of @xmath140 values , @xmath141 for @xmath142 .",
    "further , for @xmath143 with @xmath144 , we have @xmath145 with @xmath146 and @xmath147 , and the dots stand in for the yet - unknown diagonal entries . in the convex sum",

    "analogous arguments for @xmath152 and @xmath153 establish @xmath154 obviously , there is a contradiction for @xmath155 , as we can not have @xmath156 and @xmath157 and also @xmath158 for @xmath159",

    "is easily generalized to any dimension @xmath0 .",
    "the ulin estimator for @xmath160 , @xmath161 is unphysical for all @xmath95 because it has the negative eigenvalue @xmath162 .",
    "yet another example of unphysical ulin estimators for @xmath41 is provided by a projector to a superposition of two states from the first basis [ the @xmath1s of eqs .   and",

    "then , we have seen in so many examples that ulin estimators can be unphysical .",

    "since all these least - bias estimators are rank - deficient whenever they are different from the linear estimator of ideal laplace - type , we also took a look at three different estimators of full rank .",
    "as illustrated by examples , the full - rank estimators are indeed different from the least - bias estimators , but are certainly acceptable as consistent _ bona fide _ estimators .",
    "armed with these insights , one could now study questions such as _ after measuring in @xmath40 bases , which basis is optimal for the next von neumann test ?",
