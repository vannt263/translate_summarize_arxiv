    "thales of miletus ( 6th century b.c . ) made the first observations of electricity by rubbing pieces of amber being biological in origin , thanks to macroscopic charge separation .",
    "spontaneous charge separation appears also with ferroelectric materials , where at the molecular level the positive charge center is shifted relative to the negative charge distribution .",
    "the perfect alignment of these individual electric dipoles gives rise to the ferroelectricity .",
    "thus , the ferroelectric state exhibits spontaneously a macroscopic electric dipole moment even in the absence of an external electric field .",
    "this occurs below a characteristic temperature , the curie temperature t@xmath0 , where the individual electric dipoles of the molecules get spontaneously aligned ; for comparison , to polarize a dielectric material to a similar value , one needs electric fields of the order mv / cm to gv / cm , and this distinguishes ferroelectricity .",
    "the consequence of the coherent single dipole alignment is the appearance of unpaired positive and negative bound charges on the two end - faces along the direction of the spontaneous ferroelectric polarization @xmath1 . in the ideal case , a piece of ferroelectric material is equivalent to an empty capacitor of the same dimensions , each plate being charged with @xmath2 .",
    "assuming @xmath3 values by factor @xmath4 below those encountered often with crystals , the associated surface charge density ( @xmath5 ) can still be as much as @xmath6 charges/@xmath7 charges/@xmath8m@xmath9 .",
    "the maximum electric field strength inside matter is given by @xmath10 , with @xmath11 being the dielectric constant of the medium .",
    "for example , for @xmath12=1 mc / m@xmath9 only , the associated electric field is of the order of @xmath13mv / cm .",
    "such electric fields exist only transiently , and , they can give rise even to the self - emission of energetic electrons ( @xmath14 kev electrons have been measured ( s. gundel et al . , 1989 ) ) ; depending on the actual conditions those electrons might ionize the surrounding , or , they can cause other related effects .    in this section , we present in short the main properties of ferroelectricity ,",
    "a phenomenon which is also described in the text books , but we also refer to a few related articles , which can be read actually by non - specialists ( zioutas @xmath15 daskaloyannis , 1985 , gundel et al . , 1989 , riege , 1994 ) , or , modern theoretical ones ( resta , 1997 ) .",
    "it is worth remembering that ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism have at first sight many common properties . comparing both types of materials , the main difference comes from the ( at least practically ) non - existence of magnetic monopoles .",
    "the ubiquitous electric charges compensate the large polarization electric fields , and , they determine the transient ferroelectric behaviour during polarization change .",
    "thus , the ferroelectric state is completely described by its widely known static properties as well as its dynamical behaviour associated with a temperature change , or , applying externally pressure and/or electric pulses .",
    "in fact , every ferroelectric material is also piezoelectric and pyroelectric , but not _ vice versa_.    obviously , any change of the intrinsic spontaneous ferroelectric polarization ( @xmath16 is associated with a corresponding surface charge change ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "these bound polarization charges attract ( either from the surrounding or from the ferroelectric medium itself ) an equal number of charges , but opposite in sign , since no environment can stand those electric fields . in short , a ferroelectric in its static state",
    "consists of a polarized crystal or polycrystalline medium , and , quasi free screening surface charges , which partly migrate into the bulk of the ferroelectric .",
    "the time period needed , for this charge neutralization to be completed , defines the dynamical behaviour of ferroelectrics . in general , this transient time is much longer than the preceding switching time .",
    "depending on the applying electric field , temperature and the ferroelctric compound itself , transient times can be in the @xmath18sec to sec region .",
    "many ferroelectric properties during polarization change appear much more pronounced compared with those we know in the static case .",
    "for example , the dielectric constant takes enormous values around the phase transition temperature .",
    "in fact , a ferroelectric sample in its static state might remain unnoticed at first sight .",
    "it is only the change of its spontaneous polarization vector ( @xmath1 ) , which makes actually ferroelectricity visible .",
    "we mention here a few mostly encountered cases when working with such materials .",
    "* a ) *   let the temperature increase from the ferro- to the paraelectric state . during the phase transition ,",
    "the intrinsic polarization disappears , and , one is left suddenly with the unpaired screening charges on each end - surface , which must be screened so to say , because of the associated strong electric fields .",
    "since those charges are quasi - free , the result will be : either a current flow through the bulk of the ferroelectric material with both charge polarities compensating each other , or , for sufficient high intrinsic resistance of the sample , those almost unbound charges will be removed from each end - surface by their own repulsive coulomb force ( i.e. self - emission ) .  * b ) *   in the opposite process , i.e. by lowering the temperature from the paraelectric to the ferroelectric state , the onset of the spontaneous polarization attracts screening charges from the surrounding , because usually those transient electric fields are far above the electrical breakdown limit of any material , including the ferroelectric sample itself , if one should consider this to happen in space .  *",
    "c ) *   reversal of the spontaneous polarization takes place , for example , by applying an external electric field ( @xmath19kv / cm is usually sufficient ) , being either alternating or pulsed .",
    "thus , during a hysteresis loop measurement two polarization reversals occur per cycle . in a complete reversal of the intrinsic spontaneous polarization ,",
    "the new bound polarization charges on each end - face of the sample have the same polarity as the previous screening charges .",
    "this makes the associated transient electric fields even stronger than those appearing in the first two cases mentioned before .",
    "the result is finally a complete rearrangement of the old screening charges , giving rise to a more pronounced dynamical behaviour , depending on the conductivity of the sample and other factors .",
    "finally , we mention in short a few other known effects , which occur when changing the polarization vector by @xmath20 , or , much more enhanced during phase transition , which afterall can be of relevance for similar phenomena with the predicted _ biological _ ferroelectrics .",
    "these are : the flow of pyroelectric current through the sample , which occasionally takes the form of spikes ( barkhausen pulses ) , similarly to the self - emission of energetic electrons , or , bursts of microwave radiation ( caspers , riege @xmath15 zioutas , 1988 ) .",
    "we also like to mention here the antiferroelectric state , which is possibly of not minor importance .",
    "this is a peculiar polarized state , since it consists of quasi infinite many 180@xmath21 domains of opposite alignment each , which does not require screening charges .",
    "however , the transition ferroelectric@xmath22antiferroelectric gives also rise to a similar dynamical behaviour as for the mentioned paraelectric@xmath22ferroelectric phase transition .",
    "we like to focus now on a very specific family of hydrated ferroelectric crystals , with the widely investigated potassium ferrocyanide trihydrate ( k@xmath23fe(cn)@xmath243h@xmath25o ) , in short kfct ( helwig , klpperpieper , @xmath15 mser , 1978 ) , taken to be a representative case .",
    "we think that this type of ferroelectricity might serve as a model configuration in biology , with emphasis given to the microtubules , which no doubt play a fundamental rle in cell s functioning .",
    "in fact , these subcellular constituents have attracted the recent years the particular interest of biophysicists .",
    "microtubules have been predicted to posses oriented dipoles , assuming ferroelectric phase , which appears to be optimal for microtubule signaling and assembly / disassembly ( sataric et al . , 1993 , tuszynski et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "such processes are obviously of basic importance . in the light of previous work ( mavromatos and nanopoulos 1997,1998 ) , relating the ferroelectric properties to the appearance of mesoscopic quantum - coherent states in internal regions of the microtubule cylinders , playing the rle of ( thermally isolated ) electromagnetic cavities",
    ", ferroelectricity may also be important for quantum mechanical aspects of microtubular arrangements in the cell .",
    "specifically , it was suggested in [ mavromatos and nanopoulos 1998 ] that ferroelectricity in the dimer medium , strengthens isolation of the ` cavity regions ' , thereby leading to a larger probability for the coherent states to form and live long enough , so as to transport information and energy across the microtubular arrangement .",
    "the rle of the surrounding water molecules for the ferroelectricity in the dimer medium was emphasized .    in this latter respect",
    "we now mention that the interesting property of kfct is the origin of its ferroelectricty .",
    "in fact , the alignment of the water molecules by the surrounding crystalline structure ( @xmath26 ) causes the measured macroscopic spontaneous polarization @xmath27mc / m@xmath9 , which is compatible with the known microscopic water dipole configuration in kfct ( helwig , klpperpieper , @xmath15 mser , 1978 ) . to be more specific ,",
    "the onset of ferroelectric behaviour is connected with the ordering of the hydrogen - bonded water - molecules ( taylor , mller , hitterman , 1970 ) .",
    "thus , one is tempting to conclude from this particular ferroelectric crystal that a similar mechanism might be at work with the microtubules .",
    "indeed , a typical microtubular arrangement consists of a quasi solid cylinder of tubulin dimers , which are arranged in 13 arrays ( protofilaments ) .",
    "the interior of the microtubules , of cross - section diameter @xmath28 , is filled with water molecules , being ubiquitous in biology .",
    "the dimers ( of extent @xmath29 in the direction of the protofilament axis ) are believed to have unpaired ( mobile ) electric charges , which lead to electric dipole moments ( sataric _ et al .",
    "_ , 1993 , tuszynski _ et al .",
    "_ , 1995 ) .",
    "in ( mavromatos and nanopoulos , 1997 , 1998 ) it was further conjectured that there are thin layers in the interior of the cylinders , of a thickness ranging up to few atomic scales ( angstrms ) , fairly isolated from their environment , which operate as cavities sustaining mesoscopic quantum coherent modes . in this scenario ,",
    "the importance of the water molecules lies in the provision of the necessary coupling with the quantized elecgromagnetic radiation in the cavity , via their electric dipole moments , so that : ( i ) coherent modes appear in the interior of the cavity ( dipole quanta ) ( del giudice _ et al",
    ". _ 1988 ) , and ( ii ) a coupling exists between these coherent modes and the dimer dipole quantum oscillation modes ( mavromatos , nanopoulos , 1997 ) .",
    "the latter leads to coherent solitonic modes along the protofilament dimer chains , which have been argued to be responsible for dissipationless energy transfer across the microtubule .    in view of the existence of the afore - mentioned hydrated ferroelectric compounds",
    ", we may now conjecture that such configurations favour an alignment of the water molecules ( actually , not necessarily only those inside the tube ) .",
    "then , the sofar speculated polar properties of microtubules , and their connection to quantum physics , might exist in reality .",
    "because of the importance of such a ferroelectric property for these subcellular constituents , the next step is to establish or exclude it experimentally . a suggested sensitive experimental method to confirm the predicted ferroelectric behaviour of microtubules is via the four probe ac impedance spectroscopy ( z(@xmath30 ) )",
    ". this technique is based on the measuremnt of the ac voltage to current ratio using 4-electrodes ( figure 1a ) in a quite broad frequency interval ( the so called _ frequency domain technique _ ( figure 1b ) ) .",
    "the experimental set up for the ac impedance measurement of the microtubules in liquid suspension is shown in figure 2 .",
    "this method has been recognised already as a valuable tool in the study of similar electrochemical systems ( macdonald , 1987 ) .",
    "there are practical advantages of this technique compared to the more simple and old one working in the so called _ time domain _ , which applies either pulse or step source signals ( macdonald , 1987 , bottelberghs , 1978 ) .",
    "in fact , the expected ferroelectric contribution of the suspended microtubules to the measured impedance z(@xmath30 ) can only be observed in the higher frequency domain ( s. figure 1b ) .",
    "otherwise , low frequency electrochemical phenomena , being certainly present in such a liquid suspension of microtubules , complicate the whole measuring procedure , which will suppress the appearance of a ferroelectric component inside the sample .    in practice ,",
    "working with a suspension of microtubules additional experimental modifications might well become necessary .",
    "thus , in addition to a conventional dc polarization for the z(@xmath30 ) measurement one can also apply a pseudo - dc polarization , in order to avoid quasi - static complex electrochemical phenomena due to the electrode s polarization coming from slow and heavy ion transport inside the sample .",
    "the onset of ferroelectricity can be identified due to a resonance - like response in the phase and the amplitude diagram of the impedance ( s. figure 1b ) .",
