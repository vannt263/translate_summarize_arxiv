    "cold dust is thought to be generated by the collisional grinding of a planetesimal belt located between roughly 60 and 120  au  @xcite .",
    "the excess at @xmath8 is attributed to hot `` exozodiacal '' dust at @xmath9  au that is dominated by small grains and can not be in collisional equilibrium because of the too - short timescales  @xcite .",
    "the warm excess at @xmath5 is spatially distinct from the hot emission and may represent an asteroid belt at @xmath10  au  @xcite , although the flux is likely contaminated by the tail of the hot dust  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "planetesimals are transported inward by gravitational scattering by a system of planets .",
    "the outermost planet scatters planetesimals inward and passes them off to the next planet until they reach the inner system ; this is the same mechanism that delivers jupiter - family comets to the inner solar system  @xcite and is thought to be the main contributor to the solar system s zodiacal dust  @xcite .",
    "planets on static orbits can not sustain the inward - scattering rates needed to produce the observed exozodis because the outer planetesimal supply zones are depleted too rapidly  @xcite .",
    "the observed exozodis can also not be caused by dynamical instabilities among systems of giant planets  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because the pulse of inward scattering is too short in duration  @xcite .",
    "for hot inner dust to come from the outer planetesimal belt , planets must continually interact with new material .",
    "a solution is for the outermost planet to migrate outward . for a given range of planet masses and disk properties ,",
    "outward migration is naturally maintained by the gravitational back - reaction of inward - scattering of planetesimals  @xcite .",
    "planets that are too low - mass migrate rapidly but do not excite planetesimal eccentricities sufficiently to produce sufficient scattering .",

    "our goal was to produce the observed hot exozodiacal dust .",
    "but the simulations also needed to match vega s cold debris disk after 455 myr of evolution . to simplify things",

    "the initial planetesimal disks were therefore somewhat more massive than the current one .",
    "our setup was also designed to trigger outward planetesimal - driven migration of the outermost planet , which plays a role in sculpting the inner edge of the debris disk .",
    "we therefore started the planet significantly closer - in than the current planetesimal disk s inner edge .",
    "our fiducial setup had five planets placed between 5 and 30  au , evenly spaced in orbital period ratio ( @xmath14 ) .",

    "the details regarding the manner in which scattered planetesimals may evolve collisionally , or due to radiative forces and/or sublimation , potentially leading to a population of small dust grains similar to those thought to produce the exozodi emission , is a complex problem that we do not address here .",

    "figure  [ fig : jup ] shows the inward scattering rate in these systems .",
    "increasing the mass of the innermost or second - innermost planet did not have a large effect on the scattering rate . for a more distant jupiter the rate of inward - scattered planetesimals was significantly depressed .",
    "the rate was cut in half with a jupiter in the middle of the system ( at 12.2 au ) .",
    "the rate drops is borderline for a jupiter at 19.2 au and below the critical limit at 30 au .    with its high escape speed ( @xmath43 ) , a jupiter - mass planet ejects planetesimals more efficiently than it passes them inward .",
    "it disrupts the supply chain between the outer and inner planetary systems .",
    "the mechanism of inward scattering is thwarted by a gas giant planet beyond @xmath1  au .",
    "this is testable : no gas giant planet can exist beyond @xmath44  au for our mechanism to operate .",

    "= 8.5 cm      to show that the mechanism is robust we ran two additional sets of simulations with different planetesimal disk properties .",

    "the second set assumed a lower - mass and colder disk containing @xmath36 between 45 and 120 au .",
    "each disk contained 3000 planetesimals and the same orbital distribution as in the fiducial disk .",
    "for the lower - mass disk we ran simulations with planets with similar mass gradients to the most successful simulations in the fiducial disk as well as equal - mass planets with @xmath47 . for the cold disk we kept the innermost planet at 5 au while maintaining dynamical contact with the outer disk .",
    "we placed the planets between 5 and 45 au , again evenly spaced in orbital period ratio . in some simulations we included 5 planets with @xmath48 and in others 7 planets with @xmath49 .",
    "the simulations in cold disks produced inward scattering rates as high as @xmath50 .",
    "the most successful simulations had 7 planets including an jupiter - saturn like inner pair and outer planets with masses between @xmath51 and @xmath29 .",
    "although 5-planet systems generally had much lower inward scattering rates , the most successful 5 planet - system  with planet masses of 300 , 100 , 50 , 25 and @xmath29 from innermost to outermost  had a comparable scattering rate to the successful 7-planet systems .",
    "in the low - mass disk only two simulations had high enough inward scattering rates to match the @xmath52 needed to generate vega s exozodi .",
    "both successful simulations had negative radial mass gradients , with ( inner to outer ) planets masses of 300 , 100 , 50 , 25 , @xmath29 , and 100 , 50 , 25 , 10 , @xmath53 .",

    "we use a simplified approach .",
    "our goal is not to perfectly reproduce the observations but to verify that observations of our simulated planetary systems would not differ enormously from those of vega .",
    "we used the code from @xcite , which follows the procedure of @xcite , based on the model of @xcite .",
    "each simulated planetesimal was assumed to represent a distribution of objects following a collisional size - frequency with @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "each planetesimal is heated by the star and cools as a blackbody .",
    "we took into account vega s stellar properties  @xcite to derive an approximate blowout size of @xmath55 . the surface area per unit mass of our collisional distribution",
    "is @xmath56 ( assuming @xmath57  km ) .",
    "the collisional timescale @xmath58 of the largest bodies was calculated and the planetesimal mass was decreased in time as @xmath59 .",
    "this is not strictly consistent with the dynamical integration in which the planetesimal mass did not change , but the cumulative decrease in @xmath60 is relatively small ( typically 10 - 20% ) .",
    "we assumed a fixed value of @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "this does not take into account realistic dust emission , so fluxes are to be trusted within an order of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : sed ] shows that the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of our simulations provides a decent match to vega s dust flux in the mid - infrared .",
    "there is a small excess in the fiducial simulations ( the upper bound of the shaded area in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) at @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the excess comes from planetesimals scattered inward on centaur - like orbits .",
    "these planetesimals are hotter than those in the outer disk and contaminate the sed starting at slightly shorter wavelength than the observed infrared excess .",
    "they also generate warm dust at a similar level to the observations .",
    "inward - scattered planetesimals contribute a few to 10% of the stellar flux at @xmath5 , the same order of magnitude as @xcite s claimed asteroid belt . in - scattered planetesimals may account for both vega s warm and hot dust populations .",
    "however , we caution that the true dust production of these planetesimals is highly uncertain . as they may not be in collisional equilibrium as assumed ,",
    "inward - scattered planetesimals may produce less dust than in our simple calculations .",
    "in addition , any terrestrial planets inside 3  au would affect the long - term dynamics of both inward - scattered planetesimals and in - spiraling dust .",
    "the dust seds from the successful simulations in cold- and low - mass disks somewhat underestimated the flux at @xmath64 because the planetesimal mass was somewhat below the expected one ( the lower bound of the shaded region in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) .",
    "we have shown that vega s exozodi can be explained by a system of planets with orbital radii of roughly 5 - 60 au .",
    "planets scatter planetesimals from the outer planetesimal disk into the inner planetary system .",
    "the outermost planets undergo plantesimal - driven migration outward into the disk , continually encounter fresh material and can sustain a substantial inward - scattering rate for the age of the system and beyond  ( see * ? ? ? * for details of this process ) . for the mechanism to operate the system must meet the following requirements .",
    "first , the outermost 1 - 2 planets must have masses such that planetesimal - driven migration is triggered and sustained .",
    "successful simulations had @xmath65 .",
    "the inner planets masses have only a minor effect , although the highest scattering rates were for simulations with higher - mass ( saturn- to jupiter - mass ) planets closer - in .",
    "second , while the inner system may host a gas giant , a @xmath66jupiter - mass planet can not orbit beyond @xmath1  au as it too - efficiently ejects planetesimals from the system and breaks the inward - scattering chain ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : jup ] ) .",
    "this prediction does not violate current constraints  @xcite and may be tested with upcoming instruments .",
    "third , our model requires that a substantial fraction of the mass in planetesimals scattered within 3  au must end up as fine - grained dust .",
    "this fraction is @xmath6610 - 30% for the simulations we have deemed successful .",
    "if we take our simplified dust flux calculation at face value , our simulations provide a modestly good match to the observed sed ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sed ] ) .",
    "although our simulations somewhat overestimate the flux at @xmath67 , dust produced by in - scattered planetesimals may offer an alternate explanation for the @xmath11 excess detected by @xcite .",
    "planetesimal - driven migration of a system of 5 - 7 planets in a lower - mass disk and colder disk can also yield reasonable inward - scattering rates and seds .",
