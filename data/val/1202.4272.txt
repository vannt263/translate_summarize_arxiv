    "the @xmath4(1405 ) , a baryon resonance with @xmath5 , has intrigued theorists already for several decades .",
    "the proximity of its nominal mass @xcite to the @xmath6 threshold ( at around 1435 mev ) has led to speculations that this resonance is , in fact , a @xmath6 ( quasi ) bound state rather than a genuine 3-quark state as soon as it was experimentally identified in the early 1960s .",
    "a further and even more peculiar facet was added to this when it was suggested that the @xmath4(1405 ) could be actually a superposition of two resonance states @xcite .",
    "this conjecture emerged from model calculations performed within the so - called chiral unitary approach based on coupled channels ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , ... ) .",
    "subsequent investigations conducted within variants of that approach , utilizing the leading - order chiral lagrangian ( weinberg - tomozawa term ) as interaction potential but also higher - order contributions , supported the existence of two poles in the energy region of the @xmath4(1405 ) resonance @xcite .",
    "thereby it was found that typically one of the poles lies very close to the @xmath6 threshold , i.e. around 1420 - 1430 mev , and couples strongly to the @xmath6 system @xcite . the other pole exhibits a much larger variation from model to model , i.e.",
    "is usually located around 13401400 mev ( though even values around 1470 mev are reported @xcite ) and has usually a much larger width .",
    "furthermore , it couples more strongly to the @xmath2 system .    naturally , the prospect of finding two @xmath4(1405 ) resonances has trigged also an increased interest in performing corresponding experiments .",
    "these experiments are guided by the idea that reactions that are dominated by either the @xmath6 or the @xmath2 transition channels should then also provide evidence for the presence of either the one or the other corresponding pole .",
    "specifically , @xmath8 induced reactions should then be dominated by the pole around 1420 mev and , accordingly , show an enhancement in the distribution at the corresponding invariant mass @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we consider the reaction @xmath0 where the @xmath9 can be excited .",
    "our study is motivated by a corresponding proposal submitted to the j - parc 50-gev proton synchrotron .",
    "this proposal aims at a spectroscopic study of hyperon resonances below the @xmath10 threshold via the ( @xmath11 ) reaction on a deuteron target @xcite .",
    "the primary goal of the experiment is to study the position and width of the @xmath4(1405 ) resonance produced in the @xmath1 channel . for",
    "this reaction theoretical investigations were presented by jido et al . in @xcite and , with emphasis on the kinematical conditions of the dafne facility at frascati , in @xcite .",
    "their calculation is performed in impulse approximation and considers for the reaction mechanism single ( @xmath1 ) scattering but also the two - step process where the kaon first scatters off one of the nucleons and then undergoes the transition @xmath1 on the other nucleon .",
    "the required elementary @xmath12 and @xmath1 amplitudes are taken from the oset - ramos model @xcite that utilizes the weinberg - tomozawa term as interaction potential .",
    "the model calculation of @xcite yields results that are roughly in line with an old measurement of the @xmath13 invariant mass spectrum for the reaction in question from 1977 @xcite .",
    "indeed the data exhibit a peak around @xmath14 mev , i.e. at roughly the energy where all modern @xmath6 interactions cited above predict a pole so that everything seemed to match perfectly .",
    "however , because some approximations are applied in the study of @xcite this apparent success has to be taken with a grain of salt .",
    "our investigation intends to scrutinize the results of ref .",
    "@xcite in two aspects .",
    "first and most importantly , we want to avoid some of the approximations introduced in ref .",
    "for example , we do not use factorization , i.e. we do not pull out the ( @xmath12 and @xmath1 ) amplitudes from the loop integral that occurs in the calculation of the two - step process .",
    "also , and more importantly , we treat the kinematics in the green s function that appears in the loop integral properly .",
    "specifically we make sure that the three - body unitarity cut for the intermediate @xmath15 system occurs at the correct ( physical ) threshold . as we will see this has a decisive influence on the achieved results .",
    "in addition , we also consider different models for the elementary @xmath6-@xmath2 interaction .",
    "practically all the interactions in the literature are fitted to the near - threshold cross sections for @xmath10 elastic and charge - exchange scattering and for the @xmath16 and @xmath17 transitions . as a consequence ,",
    "the properties of these interactions in the @xmath10 threshold region are very similar , even down to the position of the ( nominal ) @xmath4(1405 ) resonance .",
    "however , for energies further away from the threshold there is a significant model dependence .",
    "this is reflected , for example , in the large variation of the position of the lower pole , already mentioned above , see also @xcite .",
    "indeed there are phenomenological models that describe the data around the @xmath10 threshold with comparable quality , but do not even have a second pole @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see whether and how these model differences are reflected in the results for @xmath0 .",
    "after all , the @xmath2 invariant mass spectrum samples the properties of the @xmath10-@xmath2 interaction down to the @xmath2 threshold .    in the present study we utilize the oset - ramos interaction",
    "@xcite so that we can compare our results directly with other ones that can be already found in the literature @xcite .",
    "the pole positions produced by this interaction in the isospin i=0 channel , which are associated with the @xmath4(1405 ) , are 1426 + @xmath1816 mev and 1390 + @xmath1866 mev @xcite , respectively .",
    "in addition we use a potential model that differs not only in the position of the lower pole from the oset - ramos interaction @xcite but also conceptually .",
    "in particular , we resort to a meson - exchange potential of the @xmath10-@xmath2 systems that was published by the jlich group more than 20 years ago @xcite , i.e. long before the chiral unitary approach became popular . as can be seen in the original paper @xcite , the jlich model describes the @xmath10 scattering data in the near - threshold region quite satisfactorily .",
    "other threshold quantities are fairly well reproduced too , as shown in a recent paper @xcite .",
    "of importance for the present study is also that the jlich model generates likewise two poles in the region of the @xmath4(1405 ) resonance .",
    "one pole , the @xmath6 `` bound state '' , is located fairly close to the @xmath6 threshold and to the physical real axis ( 1436 + @xmath1826 mev ) while the other one is close to the @xmath7 threshold and has a significantly larger imaginary part ( 1334 + @xmath1862 mev ) .",
    "in fact , this pole lies at the lower end of the  lower pole spectrum  mentioned above .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in the subsequent section we summarize shortly the salient features of the @xmath6 interaction of the jlich group . in sect .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] we describe in detail the formalism that is employed in our calculation of the reaction @xmath0 .",
    "the results of our calculation for the oset - ramos and the jlich @xmath6 interactions are presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "in particular , we discuss approximations applied in previous investigations and study their impact on the shape of the @xmath19 invariant mass spectrum .",
    "the manuscript closes with a summary .",
    "the jlich meson - exchange model of the @xmath20 and @xmath6 interactions has been described in detail in the literature @xcite and we refer the reader to those works .",
    "the interaction model was constructed along the lines of the ( full ) bonn @xmath21 model @xcite and its extension to the hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath22 ) system @xcite ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "specifically , this means that one has used the same scheme ( time - ordered perturbation theory ) , the same type of processes , and vertex parameters ( coupling constants , cut - off masses of the vertex form - factors ) fixed already by the study of these other reactions .",
    "the diagrams considered for the @xmath6 interaction are shown in fig .",
    "[ diakn ] .",
    "obviously the jlich model contains not only single - meson exchanges , but also higher - order box diagrams involving @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 intermediate states .",
    "most vertex parameters involving the nucleon and the @xmath27(1232 ) isobar are taken over from the ( full ) bonn @xmath21 potential .",
    "the coupling constants at vertices involving strange baryons are fixed from the @xmath22 model ( model b of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . those quantities ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 )",
    "have been related to the empirical @xmath31 coupling by the assumption of su(6 ) symmetry , cf .",
    "@xcite .    for the vertices involving mesons",
    "only , most coupling constants have been fixed by su(3 ) relating them to the empirical @xmath32 decay .",
    "an exception is the coupling constant @xmath33 , which has been adjusted to the @xmath20 data @xcite , for the following reason : the @xmath34 meson ( with a mass of about 600 mev ) is not considered as a genuine particle but as a simple parametrization of correlated @xmath35-exchange processes in the scalar - isoscalar channel .",
    "therefore , its coupling strength can not be taken from symmetry relations . concerning the @xmath36-exchange the coupling strengths for both @xmath37 and @xmath38 were kept at their su(6 ) values .",
    "at the same time a phenomenological , very short - ranged contribution was added , denoted as @xmath39 .",
    "this phenomenological piece has the same analytical form as @xmath34-exchange , but an exchange mass of 1200 mev and , most importantly , an opposite sign . such a short - range contribution was required in order to obtain sufficient repulsion for a reasonable description of the @xmath40-wave @xmath20 phase shifts @xcite .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this phenomenological piece can be explained dynamically , even on a quantitative level , by genuine quark - gluon exchange processes .",
    "the contributions to the @xmath6 interaction in @xcite are fixed from those of the @xmath20 model @xcite via a g - parity transformation .",
    "the only exception is the phenomenological @xmath39 whose strength is re - adjusted by a fit to @xmath6 data .",
    "its contribution required there was found to be considerably reduced as compared to @xmath20 .",
    "indeed , this is in line with the results of @xcite because the quark - gluon exchange processes that generate most of the repulsion simulated by the @xmath39 in case of @xmath20 are absent in the @xmath6 channel due to the different quark structure of the @xmath41 meson .    of course , in case of the @xmath6 system there are already open channels at the reaction threshold and the coupling to those channels ( @xmath42 , @xmath7 ) is taken into account explicitly .",
    "the diagrams considered for the @xmath43 transitions and the @xmath44 interactions are shown in fig .",
    "[ dialp ] . also here",
    "su(3 ) symmetry has been used for fixing the vertex parameters as far as possible .    with the @xmath6 potential and the @xmath43 and the @xmath44 transition interaction derived from the diagrams in figs .",

    "other 2-step processes in conjunction with process a in the form of a subsequent @xmath51 or @xmath52 final - state interaction ( fsi ) are neglected .",
    "this is done because , as will be demonstrated later , the contribution from the process a to the cross section is a factor @xmath53 smaller than the one from process b2 in the considered region of incident @xmath8 lab momenta around @xmath54 mev@xmath55 .",

    "one only has to take care that the bound state deuteron in the initial state is incorporated , which should be described as a state in the heisenberg representation ( see also , for example @xcite ) .",
    "since we will use different interaction models for generating the @xmath63-matrices , derived in different frameworks , and a nonrelativistic deuteron wave function , those equations are not written in invariant form .",

    "now let us reveal why no clear peaks are seen in our results of the cross sections , in contrast to what was shown in ref .",

    "results not least from the fact that their calculation is roughly in line with data of an old measurement of the @xmath13 invariant mass spectrum for the reaction in question from 1977 @xcite .",

    "based on two - step processes , the cross sections below the @xmath132 threshold turn out to be suppressed by the green s function , we refrain from discussing the results below the threshold , i.e. in the @xmath4(1405 ) resonance region , in detail .",
    "rather we focus on the differences in the predictions for the @xmath7 invariant mass spectra at @xmath129 mev/@xmath130 based on the jlich and the oset - ramos interactions , as seen in figs .",
    "[ f5_1 ] and [ f5_2 ] . to shed light on this difference",
    "let us compare the individual contributions from the processes b1 and b2 for the two interactions in question .",
    "this is done in figs .",
    "[ f5_8 ] and [ f5_9 ] , exemplary for the final states @xmath159 and @xmath134 . as is clear from fig .",
    "[ f5_8 ] , the contributions from the process b2 predicted by those two interactions are very similar above the @xmath132 threshold . on the other hand ,",
    "the cross section for the process b1 by the oset - ramos interaction is much smaller than that of the jlich potential and amounts to just about 40% as compared to the latter at the @xmath160 threshold , cf .",
    "[ f5_9 ] . these two processes ( b1 and b2 )",
    "interfere and produce the differences seen between figs .",
    "[ f5_1 ] and [ f5_2 ] .",
    "we have confirmed that the difference due to b1 above comes from the difference of the amplitude @xmath148 in the relevant @xmath161 wave .",
    "for example , the corresponding @xmath162 ( two - body ) cross section at @xmath163 mev/@xmath130 is 3.62  mb for the jlich interaction while it is just 1.57  mb for the oset - ramos interaction .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath164 elastic total cross sections at @xmath163 mev/@xmath130 based on the amplitude @xmath147 that enters into the process b2 are similar for the two interactions : 13.8  mb for the jlich and 13.5  mb for the oset - ramos interaction    0.2 cm    .various @xmath6 @xmath161-wave cross sections in @xmath165 for @xmath166 mev / c .",
    "results are given for the jlich @xcite and oset - ramos ( or ) @xcite @xmath6 interactions and two partial wave analyses @xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table1 ]    in table [ table1 ] we summarize the @xmath161-wave cross sections for various channels at @xmath167 mev/@xmath130 and compare them with results of two partial wave analyses from the 1970s @xcite .",
    "obviously the predictions of the jlich model agree well with the @xmath161-wave @xmath168 scattering cross section deduced from empirical information but overshoot the other channels , while the oset - ramos interaction is only in line with phenomenology in case of the charge - exchange reaction",
    ". this may be not too surprising in view of the fact that both models were primarily designed to reproduce the @xmath6 data near threshold . on the other hand",
    ", it is obvious that for a future quantitative analysis of the reaction @xmath48 , two - body amplitudes for @xmath169 and @xmath162 are required that are fully consistent with the available scattering data .",
    "furthermore , one should not forget that at momenta around @xmath170 mev/@xmath130 higher partial wave could already play a role , an issue which likewise has to be addressed in a quantitative analysis of upcoming experimental information .",
    "we investigated the reaction @xmath0 taking into account single scattering and the two - step process due to @xmath1 rescattering .",
    "this reaction is considered as a promising candidate for exploring the properties of the @xmath9 resonance .",
    "the main aim of our work was to examine the influence of some approximations applied in earlier studies of this reaction @xcite on the results for the @xmath2 invariant mass spectrum .",
    "in particular , in our study we did not use factorization , i.e. the @xmath12 and @xmath1 amplitudes that enter into the calculation of the two - step process are not pulled out of the loop integral , and , more importantly , we treated the kinematics in the green s function that appears in the loop integral properly .",
    "specifically we made sure that the three - body unitarity cut for the intermediate @xmath15 system occurs at the correct ( physical ) threshold .",
    "in addition we consider different models for the elementary @xmath6-@xmath2 interaction .",
    "we found that the factorization approximation leads to an overall reduction in the magnitude of the predicted invariant mass spectrum in the order of roughly 30% .",
    "however , the lineshape itself remains practically unchanged by this approximation . on the other hand ,",
    "the approximation in the kinematics of the green s function , also applied in the works of jido et al .",
    "@xcite , has a rather dramatic impact on the resulting lineshape .",
    "this approximation shifts the three - body cut due to the opening of the @xmath171 threshold down by roughly 14 mev from its physical value .",
    "it then coincides practically with the peak value of the elementary @xmath6-@xmath2 amplitude that corresponds to the @xmath4(1405 ) resonance and , consequently , the resulting lineshape exhibits a strong enhancement at a @xmath2 invariant mass of around 1426 mev .",
    "in contrast , a calculation where the @xmath171 cut is taken into account precisely leads to a @xmath2 invariant mass spectrum that has a pronounced peak around 1435 mev , i.e. at the opening of the @xmath171 channel . indeed",
    "the peak is nothing else than a threshold effect ( cusp ) . in that calculation",
    "the contribution of the rescattering process @xmath6-@xmath2 around 1426 mev , where this amplitude has its maximum , is already significantly suppressed by the deuteron wave function and the fall - off of the @xmath171 green s function .",
    "thus , only a rather broad structure is visible in the spectrum for the case of the @xmath6-@xmath2 generated from the oset - ramos interaction whereas for the jlich @xmath6 model there is no direct sign at all of the @xmath4(1405 ) resonance .",
    "interestingly , existing data on the @xmath13 invariant mass spectrum from the reaction @xmath0 @xcite seem to suggest a peak around @xmath14 mev - and not at the @xmath132 threshold ! should that be confirmed in the planned measurements at j - parc it would be certainly a sign for the inadequacy of the approach adopted so far in the pertinent investigations @xcite . and it would be a strong hint that one should rather rely on faddeev - type approaches where all rescattering processes can be summed up to infinite order .",
    "then the structure in the two - body amplitudes corresponding to the @xmath4(1405 ) resonance can be generated within the three - body context in a consistent way .",
    "moreover , exact three - body unitarity can be automatically fulfilled .",
    "such a calculation is beyond the scope of the present investigation but we intend to address this issue in a future study .",
