    "one major problem is that the electron is not isolated from its environment but interacts with the nuclei in the semiconductor it has been confined to .",
    "this interaction leads to relaxation of excited spin states , as well as to the decay of spin - state superpositions ( decoherence ) . for most quantum dots at low temperatures ,",
    "the main source of spin decoherence is the electron s interaction with a fluctuating magnetic field created by the randomly precessing nuclear spins . @xcite for iii - v semiconductor quantum dots , with their high abundance of spin - carrying nuclear isotopes , the associated decoherence times are quite short , usually of order nanoseconds , @xcite if no manipulations on the nuclear system are performed .    one way of overcoming the problem of short decoherence times is to build quantum dots from semiconductors with lower abundances of spin - carrying isotopes , potentially resulting in weaker nuclear - spin interactions .",
    "carbon structures naturally consist of 99% @xmath4 with nuclear spin @xmath5 and only of 1% @xmath2 with nuclear spin @xmath6 , and are therefore promising materials for building quantum dots featuring long spin decoherence times .",
    "this extraordinary property of carbon materials , as well as their comparatively weak spin - orbit interactions , has led to proposals of fabricating quantum dots in graphene ribbons with armchair boundaries @xcite and in carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) .",

    "the carbon atom features six electrons : two core electrons and four valence electrons . in a solid , the four valence electrons ( which are in @xmath8 and @xmath9 states ) form the bonds with the nearest - neighbor atoms . in two - dimensional graphite , or graphene , each atom has three nearest neighbors , and three of the four valence electrons form @xmath10-hybridized bonds ( called @xmath11-bonds ) with those neighbors , while the fourth electron is in a so - called @xmath12-state perpendicular to the @xmath11-bonds .",
    "@xcite the @xmath12-electrons in graphene determine the band structure near the fermi energy , while the @xmath11-electrons form more remote bands .",

    "the wavefunction of a conduction - band electron in a periodic crystal is given by bloch s theorem : @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the number of atomic sites in the crystal and the bloch amplitude @xmath32 has the periodicity of the lattice .",
    "following ref . , we approximate the bloch amplitude @xmath32 at the k and k points by a linear combination of hydrogenic orbitals , @xmath33 , where @xcite @xmath34 and the sum runs over all lattice sites in the cnt . in the above , @xmath35 represents a hydrogenic @xmath8 orbital , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are , respectively , the @xmath9 orbitals along the transverse , circumferential , and radial direction of the cnt , and @xmath39 normalizes the bloch amplitude to two atoms per unit cell . @xmath40 is the angle between @xmath13 and @xmath41 , and we can write @xmath42 and @xmath43 in terms of the chiral indices . @xcite the hydrogenic orbitals consist of a radial and an angular part , e.g. , @xmath44 .",
    "we will choose a local coordinate system at each lattice site , such that @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 correspond to hydrogenic @xmath9 orbitals in @xmath45- , @xmath46- , and @xmath47-direction , respectively ( see below ) .",

    ", we write the electron states as @xmath54 where , in the envelope - function approximation , @xmath55 . since we did not include spin - orbit interactions in our model , the orbital wavefunction is independent of the spin state , and we may omit the subscript @xmath11 : @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "there are three terms that couple the spin of the confined electron to the nuclear spins in the cnt : the fermi contact interaction , the anisotropic hyperfine interaction and the coupling of electron orbital angular momentum to the nuclear spins .",
    "these interactions are represented by the hamiltonians @xcite @xmath58 respectively , where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the bohr magneton , @xmath62 is the nuclear g - factor of isotopic species @xmath63 , @xmath64 is the nuclear magneton , @xmath65 is the vacuum permeability , @xmath66 is the electron - spin position operator relative to the nucleus , @xmath67 is a length of nuclear dimensions , @xmath68 is the charge of the nucleus , and @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath70 and @xmath71 denote the spin and orbital angular - momentum operators ( with respect to the @xmath72 nucleus ) of the electron , respectively .",
    "the cutoff @xmath73 comes from the dirac equation ( see , e.g. , ref . ) and avoids unphysical divergences from expectation values of the hamiltonians @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "in the problem considered here , this cutoff may be omitted for the following reasons : ( i ) the expectation values of @xmath74 and @xmath75 with respect to an @xmath76-state vanish identically due to the spherical symmetry of the wavefunction and the vanishing orbital angular momentum , respectively .",
    "the expectation values with respect to a @xmath0-state are non - zero , but the @xmath0-wavefunction goes to zero sufficiently fast at the position of each nucleus , thus avoiding a divergence .",
    "( ii ) as mentioned above , the electron wavefunction does not extend significantly to the nearest - neighbor lattice sites . hence , within our tight - binding approximation , the orbital @xmath49 centered around some nucleus can not cause a divergence at the position of a nearest neighbor .",
    "we note that the orbital angular momentum @xmath77 which appears in eq . is associated with the electronic motion around the @xmath72 nucleus and is described by the bloch part of the electron wavefunction .",
    "on the other hand , it has been shown in ref .",
    ", that interatomic currents can occur along the nanotube circumference to which another orbital angular momentum @xmath78 may be associated which is described by the envelope part of the electron wavefunction . however , the hyperfine coupling strength is defined via the bloch part of the electron wavefunction and therefore a consideration of the coupling between the valley degrees of freedom via envelope - function - associated angular momenta is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we will consider cnts and graphene with different abundances of the nuclear isotopes @xmath4 and @xmath2 .",
    "while @xmath4 does not carry a nuclear spin , the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio of @xmath2 is non - vanishing and given by @xmath79 .",
    "the fermi contact interaction yields a finite contribution for @xmath76-states , but vanishes for @xmath0-states . the anisotropic hyperfine interaction and the coupling of orbital angular momentum",
    "vanish for @xmath76-states because of their spherical symmetry and zero orbital angular momentum , but yield a finite contribution for @xmath0-states .",
    "therefore , when considering cnts , all three interactions - have to be taken into account because of the @xmath1-hybridized electron states , while for graphene , only the interactions and are relevant , due to the purely @xmath0-type wavefunction ( corresponding to the limit @xmath80 in eq . ) .",
    "we first calculate matrix elements of the interactions - with respect to the electron wavefunction , which will lead to effective spin hamiltonians and to the associated coupling strengths in the cnt case . throughout this section",
    ", we will consider a cnt that consists only of spin - carrying @xmath2 isotopes .",
    "the possibility of different nuclear isotope abundances will then be taken into account in sec .",
    "[ sec : dynamics ] . from the cnt results",
    ", it will be possible to perform the ` graphene limit ' , which we postpone to sec .",
    "[ sec : int_graphene ] .",
    "we start with the fermi contact interaction and calculate @xmath81 assuming that the electron - spin density does not depend on the lattice site , which is justified if , e.  g. , the envelope function @xmath82 describes the ground state of the quantum dot .",
    "the effects of a site dependence of the electron - spin density have been recently considered in ref . .",
    "evaluating the spin matrix elements leads to the following effective spin hamiltonian : @xmath83 with coupling constants @xmath84 ( where @xmath85 is the volume of a primitive unit cell ) and the associated coupling strength @xmath86 where we have introduced @xmath87 , and @xmath88 is the bohr radius .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath39 can be determined by normalizing eq . to two atoms per unit cell : @xmath89 we have evaluated eq .",
    "for cnts of different chiralities in table [ table : hyperfine ] .",
    "for typical cnts , the coupling strength @xmath90 is about three orders of magnitude smaller than that for an electron in a gaas quantum dot ( @xmath91 , see ref . ) , for two reasons : ( i ) the hybridization prefactor @xmath92 is on the order of @xmath93 and enters quadratically into @xmath90 .",
    "( ii ) the effective nuclear charge ( which enters in third power into @xmath90 ) is @xmath94 for carbon , but @xmath95 for gallium and @xmath96 for arsenic . @xcite",
    "the sign of the isotropic interaction is positive for all nanotube diameters , in contrast to results reported previously , @xcite where spin relaxation of conduction electrons has been calculated numerically and a sign change of the hyperfine coupling constant @xmath90 has been found for small nanotube diameters .",
    "this is due to the fact that in ref .",
    "the coupling of the @xmath97 core electrons to the nuclear spins is included , which , however , is irrelevant for the hyperfine interaction of a conduction electron and , hence , for the electron spin dephasing considered in this article .",
    "now we look at the anisotropic hyperfine interaction . due to symmetry , the @xmath76-part of the hybridized wavefunction does not contribute .",
    "taking matrix elements @xmath98 just like above , we arrive at an effective hamiltonian @xmath99 with coupling constants @xmath100 and the coupling strengths @xmath101 where @xmath102 we see that the coupling induced by the anisotropic hyperfine interaction is different in all three spatial directions . recall that we have labeled our axes such that @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 refer to the translational , circumferential , and radial directions , respectively .",
    "we show typical values for @xmath103 in table [ table : hyperfine ] .",
    "the direction of strongest hyperfine interaction is radial to the nanotube .",
    "for the cnts in table [ table : hyperfine ] comes directly from the angular integration in the expressions @xmath104 , leading to eq . :",
    "the admixture of @xmath36 and @xmath37 to the @xmath12-orbital in eq .",
    "is very small , such that the integration approximately reduces to the @xmath38 term ( the @xmath35 term does not contribute by symmetry ) . ]",
    "it is interesting to note the competing signs : the fermi contact interaction ( expressed via @xmath90 ) enhances the anisotropic hyperfine interaction along the radial direction , but reduces it along the circumferential and transverse directions .",
    "furthermore , the signs of the hyperfine coupling along different directions indicate ferro- and antiferromagnetic alignment of the nuclear spins with respect to the electron spin ( in the ground state ) . we will come back to this in sec .",

    ", curvature induces an @xmath1-hybridization of the electron orbital , opening a new channel of spin decoherence via the fermi contact interaction .",
    "however , for typical cnts , the fermi contact interaction is only a small correction to the anisotropic hyperfine interaction , the latter being the main source of nuclear - spin - induced decoherence of the electron spin .",
    "we found the total hyperfine coupling strength of an electron with the @xmath2 nuclei to be less than @xmath3 for both graphene and cnts quantum dots  about two orders of magnitude smaller than the hyperfine interaction of an electron in a gaas or inas quantum dot .",
    "we have used a simple model for the @xmath1-hybridization in cnts , from which we have derived the hyperfine interaction .",

    "we have found an interesting interplay of hyperfine couplings along different spatial directions , leading to a highly anisotropic knight shift and an alignment of the @xmath2 nuclear spins around the cnt in the ground state of the nuclear spins . this result is particularly interesting when viewed in context of the hyperfine - induced nuclear phase transition predicted in ref . for a luttinger liquid , which requires a non - vanishing mean value of the hyperfine field .",

    "we emphasize that this anisotropy is present in cnts of any chirality , in particular also in metallic cnts .",
