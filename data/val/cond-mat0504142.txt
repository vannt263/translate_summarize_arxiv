    "in the ten years since slonczewski@xcite and berger@xcite discovered the quantum mechanical phenomenon of spin - transfer torque,@xcite considerable evidence has accumulated that a spin - polarized current that passes through a thin ferromagnetic film can induce switching and/or precession of the film s magnetization .",
    "early experiments used multilayers,@xcite nanowires,@xcite small particle junctions,@xcite and point contacts@xcite to infer the presence of this effect .",

    "non - magnetic leads connect the spin valve to electron reservoirs .    due to the phenomenon of giant magnetoresistance,@xcite voltage measurements",
    "are sufficient to reveal that hysteretic switching of @xmath1 occurs as a function of the applied current density @xmath2 when a magnetic field @xmath3 smaller than the coercive field is applied along the easy axis of the free layer . for larger values of @xmath3",
    ", it is believed that @xmath1 exhibits one or more types of stable precession as a function of @xmath2 until the current density is large enough to induce switching .",
    "this conclusion@xcite is based on the experimental observation of narrow band microwave emission combined with calculations using a generalized landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation that predict precession of the free layer .",
    "other observed dynamical behavior includes telegraph noise that is interpreted as rapid switching between two distinct states of magnetization.@xcite    several experimental groups have used the macrospin ( single domain ) approximation to propose `` phase diagrams '' that identify the dynamical state of their spin valves as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath3.@xcite there have also been purely theoretical studies of the llg equation ( generalized to include spin - transfer torque ) using both macrospin models@xcite and micromagnetics simulations@xcite that do not make the single - domain approximation .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to extract a coherent picture from all this work because different authors make different choices for the physical effects they believe most affect the dynamics .",
    "there is not even unanimity amongst authors for the form of the spin - transfer torque itself .",

    "the corresponding @xmath46 approximation for the angular dependence of the magnetoresistance describes real spin valve data@xcite better than one would expect based on the transport theory predictions , to which we turn next .",

    "we draw special attention to the lower limit of the opp / ap phase field in the 3 k phase diagram .",
    "the perfectly horizontal portion of this phase boundary is an artifact of the current scanning mode used to generate the diagram .",
    "if we fix @xmath2 and scan the external field @xmath3 from large values to small values , the opp phase does not give way to the ap phase until the dashed line in the diagram is crossed .",
    "the exact shape of this boundary depends on the @xmath3-scan rate , but it is reasonable to suppose that the corresponding horizontal phase boundary found in ref .",

    "the effect of increasing temperature is very similar to the effect of decreasing the current density sweep rate in fig .",
    "[ fig : tendconverge ] . indeed , since our simulated current sweep rate is always much faster than experiment , the temperatures indicated on the phase diagrams in figure  [ fig : pd - contour ] must be regarded as nominal .",
    "the true phase diagram at each temperature we show would exhibit less hysteresis .",
    "equivalently , each panel actually corresponds to a lower physical temperature than the temperature we quote .",
    "thus , our @xmath91  3000  k diagram indicates ( qualitatively ) how the 300  k phase diagram might look if we could use current sweep rates comparable to those used experimentally .",
    "we note also that substantial joule heating occurs in real spin valve samples , perhaps 15  k to 20  k per 10@xmath92 a/@xmath93.@xcite    our highest temperature simulation shows p@xmath84ap hysteresis when @xmath3 is small and complete reversibility when @xmath3 is large .",
    "this resolves the disagreement between theory and experiment noted above .",
    "moreover , state - to - state switching characterizes every reversible phase boundary .",
    "[ fig : tele ] illustrates this for the dynamics of switching between the anti - parallel ap state and out - of - plane precession ( opp ) .",
    "the time - series data for the magnetoresistance was collected on the opp / ap phase boundary at 3000 k. clearly , the system switches back and forth between the ap state ( small fluctuations around unit normalized resistance ) and the opp state ( periodic oscillations of the normalized resistance between zero and one ) .",
    "experiments show precisely this sort of telegraph noise@xcite if we replace the full scale excursions of the opp resistance with small scale fluctuations around the average resistance of the opp state .",
    "we are not aware of experiments that study the telegraph noise at our 300 k ipp / opp boundary or our 3000 k p / opp boundary .",
    "indeed , at the latter , our simulations actually show random switching between _ three _ states : ap , ipp , and opp .",
    "the variations of the computed resistance near the 3000  k p / opp and opp / ap phase boundaries lead to two peaks in the differential resistance , @xmath94 .",
    "these agree well with the peaks in @xmath95 observed experimentally .",
    "on the other hand , kiselev _",
    "et al._@xcite identify a `` w''-phase that is completely absent from our 3000  k phase diagram .",
    "however , the experimental w - phase field appears exactly where our model predicts opp / ap phase bistability at 3 k and 300 k ( two left panels of fig .  [",
    "fig : pd - contour ] ) .",
    "the experimental w - phase is microwave quiet above the experimental low frequency cut - off ( 0.1  ghz ) and it exhibits a magnetoresistance that is slightly , but distinctly , smaller than that of the ap configuration .",
    "this would occur in our macrospin model if the free layer were frozen into a static configuration with @xmath1 neither parallel nor anti - parallel to @xmath0 .",
    "we will return to the w - phase when we discuss micromagnetic simulations in section  [ micromag ] .",
    "quantitatively , our calculated coercive field is about half the experimental value .",
    "this discrepancy may reflect an inaccurate description of the shape ( and therefore the magnetostatic anisotropies ) of the free layer .",
    "another contributory effect is our complete neglect of dipolar coupling to the fixed layer . at low @xmath37",

    "each centered on an out - of - plane axis not far from the @xmath118-axis.@xcite precessional states at higher current density correspond to one or the other of these out - of - plane ( opp ) trajectories , _",
    "e.g. _ , the as / ss orbit in fig .",

    "spin - transfer torque tends to push the orbit away from the easy plane in the northern unit hemisphere .",
    "the effect on the orbit in the southern unit hemisphere is more complex .",
    "the net result is that the `` center '' of the orbit moves away from the easy plane . in other words , as the current density increases , the component @xmath112 of @xmath107 increases , which increases @xmath111 , and thus increases the frequency @xmath117 of the orbit .    along the thick segment of the out - of - plane orbit , the spin - transfer torque and the torque from the demagnetization field point in ( nearly ) opposite directions .",
    "this means that the net torque , and thus the orbital speed along that segment , decreases as @xmath2 increases .",
    "eventually , this slowing down overwhelms the speeding up described just above and the total orbital period begins to increase .",
    "this is why @xmath105 decreases for the largest values of @xmath2 where precession occurs in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : freq_default ] .",
    "there are two major discrepancies between the cornell experiment@xcite and our minimal model results : the variation of the precession frequency @xmath106 with current density @xmath2 and the absence of a microwave quiet `` w - phase '' . within the context of the macrospin model",

    "several differences with the corresponding slonczewski torque phase diagram ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pd - contour ] ) should be noted .",
    "first , with a sine torque , the low - field p@xmath97ap transition is mediated by in - plane precession in the same way that precession mediates the ap@xmath97p transition for both the sine and slonczewski torques .",
    "this occurs because @xmath119 is symmetric around @xmath120 while the minimal model torque is not .",
    "second , the sine torque generates no hysteresis in the high - field transitions p@xmath84ipp and ipp@xmath84opp .",
    "third , the lower limit of the opp phase boundary determined by a field scan from large @xmath3 to small @xmath3 ( dashed curve ) greatly reduces the size of the ap phase field compared to the slonczewski case .",
    "this feature does not appear to have been noticed in previous discussions of this phase diagram.@xcite    unlike the slonczewski torque , increasing current or field eventually drives the sine torque model to a transition from out - of - plane precession ( opp ) to a static phase where the macrospin @xmath1 is `` fixed '' ( f ) at some angle between zero and @xmath121 .",
    "this is intriguing because the magnetoresistance and microwave power characteristics of this phase match exactly to those of the experimentally observed `` w - phase '' .",
    "unfortunately , the location of the f phase in the sine torque phase diagram does not agree with the location of the w - phase in the experimental phase diagram ( see the penultimate paragraph of sec .",
    "[ hjphase ] )    the bottom left panel in fig .  [",
    "fig : as_ss_sine_ef ] shows the 3000 k phase diagram for the sine torque macrospin model .",
    "compared to the corresponding diagram for the minimal model ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pd - contour ] ) , thermal effects eliminate opp / ap bistability only when @xmath2 is small .",
    "hysteresis between these phases remains when @xmath2 is large . in this sense ,",
    "the sine torque model is more resistant to thermal fluctuations than the slonczewski torque model .    finally , the out - of - plane precession frequency for the sine torque is a strictly increasing function of @xmath2 .",
    "the argument is similar to the one in sec .",
    "[ orbit ] for the slonczewski torque .",
    "however , as the current increases , the different angular dependence of the sine torque causes the orbit of @xmath107 to push steadily away from the easy plane everywhere and contract on the unit sphere ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : opp ] ) .",
    "the frequency @xmath117 increases monotonically because the demagnetization field @xmath111 increases .",
    "the outward motion and areal contraction of the orbit continues as the current increases until the orbit area shrinks to a single point on the unit sphere .",
    "this is the signature of the fixed ( f ) phase .      the as / ss curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : torque ] shows that the asymmetric slonczewski torque used in our minimal model is essentially identical to the symmetric slonczewski torque for the spin valve geometry of ref .  .",

    "et al._,@xcite a spin valve with film thicknesses , @xmath122 is very asymmetric .",
    "the cu / co bilayers on opposite sides of the spacer layer are very different : the left bilayer is mostly ferromagnet , the right bilayer is mostly non - magnet .",
    "the difference between the symmetric and asymmetric slonczewski torques for this geometry is still small ( compare the two dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : torque ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is large enough to produce small - angle , in - plane precession that `` rounds '' the low - to - high resistance jump in the as hysteresis curve at the p@xmath97ap transition in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : type_i_ii ] .",
    "the same panel shows similar precessional rounding for the sine - type spin - transfer torque .",

    "lower panel : @xmath123 t ; upper panel : @xmath124 t . ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : type_i_ii ] also shows that the critical current @xmath96 for the p@xmath97ap transition differs for all three spin - transfer torques while the critical current @xmath98 for the reverse ap@xmath97p transition distinguishes only the sine torque .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that @xmath96 ( @xmath98 ) is inversely proportional the slope of the torque function @xmath125 ( plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : torque ] ) at @xmath126 ( @xmath127).@xcite the fact that @xmath96 is smaller for the as torque than for the ss torque suggests that an asymmetric geometry like the one above may be desirable for some applications .",
    "we mentioned in sec .",

    "a recent experimental report@xcite has been interpreted by its authors to mean that the size of this torque  displayed in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : cief]) is much larger than theoretical estimates . accordingly ,",
    "[ fig : as_ss_sine_ef ] shows how the spin valve 3 k phase diagram changes if we augment the sine torque ( top middle panel ) and the minimal model torque ( top right panel ) by an effective field torque that is 20% of the spin - transfer torque , as suggested by this experiment . for comparison ,",
    "the bottom middle and bottom right panels respectively show the phase diagrams for these two situations at 3000 k. we find that the topology of the phase diagram does not change , although the precise positions of the phase boundaries do . the qualitative behavior of the precession frequencies is not affected .",
    "the original discussion of spin - pumping@xcite focused on the enhancement of gilbert damping that occurs when a normal metal is in intimate contact with a precessing thin film ferromagnet .",

    "the small differences we find between the two show that spin - pumping does not much affect the sort of precessional motion produced by our minimal model .",
    "there is also no qualitative change in the current dependence of the precession frequency .",
