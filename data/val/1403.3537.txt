    "the ads / cft correspondence relates a gravitational theory in @xmath1 dimensions to a cft in @xmath2 dimensions .",
    "various explicit solutions of the einstein equations with a negative cosmological constant have been studied in this context , for example stationary black hole solutions are known to describe thermal equilibrium states of the cft",
    ". an interesting class of solutions of the @xmath3 dimensional einstein equations are the solutions with an algebraically special weyl tensor .",
    "this includes black hole solutions such as kerr - ads but also much more general solutions which have free functional degrees of freedom and no isometries . in this paper",
    "we will study the ads / cft interpretation of such solutions .",
    "the goldberg - sachs theorem implies that the algebraically special property is equivalent to the existence of a null geodesic congruence with vanishing shear . in this paper",
    "we will focus on spacetimes for which this congruence also has vanishing rotation but non - vanishing expansion .",
    "this defines the _ robinson - trautman _ ( rt )",
    "family of algebraically special solutions @xcite",
    ". a general member of the rt family is a time - dependent deformation of the schwarzschild - ads solution . as we will explain in section [ rt - section ] , these solutions have a simple explicit form depending on one function @xmath4 of three coordinates .",
    "this function is constrained to satisfy a certain parabolic pde : the rt equation .",
    "the conformal boundary of a rt solution is a 2 + 1 dimensional spacetime with metric ds^2 = - t^2 + e^2(t , x ) |g_ij(x ) x^i x^j where @xmath5 is a two - dimensional metric of constant curvature and @xmath4 is the function mentioned above . in general",
    "this metric has no symmetries .",
    "one can regard it as an inhomogeneous cosmological spacetime .",
    "the cft lives in this spacetime .",
    "using ads / cft we determine the expectation value of the cft energy - momentum tensor in a state dual to a rt solution .",
    "we find that this can be written very simply as the sum of a perfect fluid part , with the fluid at rest in the above coordinates , and a 3-derivative term constructed from the curvature of the boundary metric .    from a cft perspective , this result is surprising because it is a _ local _ function of the boundary geometry , i.e. , @xmath6 depends only on the spacetime geometry at the point @xmath7 and not , as would generically be the case , on the geometry at other points e.g. those in the past light - cone of this point .",
    "this result can be attributed to the fact that the bulk spacetime contains only _ ingoing _ radiation : the algebraically special property implies that there is no scattering in the bulk and hence information does not propagate from the boundary at an early time back to the boundary at a later time .",
    "when the cft is in a state in which observables vary slowly compared to the microscopic scale of the theory ( e.g. set by the mean free path ) then it can be described by a hydrodynamic derivative expansion . in the simplest situation of an uncharged fluid",
    ", the fluid is described by slowly varying temperature and velocity fields .",
    "the fluid stress tensor is expressed as an expansion in derivatives of these quantities .",
    "the coefficients in this expansion are known as transport coefficients .",
    "the _ fluid / gravity correspondence _ of ref .",
    "@xcite ( for a recent review see @xcite ) postulates the form of the bulk metric dual to a general motion of the fluid .",
    "this metric takes the form of an infinite derivative expansion , whose form has been determined explicitly up to two derivatives .",
    "the bulk einstein equation and the ads / cft correspondence then determine the transport coefficients of the dual fluid .    the metric of the fluid / gravity correspondence is sufficiently complicated that it seems worth looking at particular cases in which it simplifies .",
    "one practical reason for doing this is that it might be possible to determine the derivative expansion explicitly to higher order in a particular case than has been achieved in the general case .",
    "if the particular case is `` sufficiently general '' , then it might be possible to determine some of the higher order transport coefficients this way .",
    "( this possibility was also discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which considered a class of stationary bulk solutions for which @xmath8 takes a perfect fluid form . )    in this paper , we will study the rt solution using the methods of the fluid / gravity correspondence . in this case",
    "we know the expectation value of the cft energy momentum tensor exactly so we can expand it in derivatives to an arbitrarily high order .",
    "since the solution contains free functional degrees of freedom , it seems likely that it is general enough for this procedure to determine certain higher order transport coefficients .    to define transport coefficients",
    ", one must write out the derivative expansion of the energy - momentum tensor including all possible terms that can arise at each order in derivatives , modulo lower - order equations of motion and geometrical identities .",
    "identifying all possible terms becomes complicated beyond second order . to simplify this problem",
    ", we introduce a new formalism for studying conformal relativistic fluid mechanics in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "this is inspired by the geroch - held - penrose formalism in general relativity @xcite . in our formalism , everything is reduced to the manipulation of scalar quantities .",
    "this makes the classification of higher derivative terms much more straightforward than in a tensorial approach .    applying this formalism to the energy - momentum tensor obtained from the rt solutions , we find that certain transport coefficients associated to four- and six - derivative terms are determined uniquely .",
    "however , somewhat disappointingly , it turns out that transport coefficients associated to three - derivative terms are not constrained .",
    "we also study the entropy current defined by these solutions , and find that some higher - order curvature terms have no contribution to the divergence of the entropy current .",
    "in addition , our formalism enables us to determine uniquely the coefficients of some higher - order terms in the entropy current .",
    "another nice example is the kerr - ads bulk metric . in this case , the cft lives in the einstein static universe @xmath9 . for a large black hole , the hydrodynamic description of the cft should be valid . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the cft energy - momentum tensor was determined .",
    "it was found to take the form of a perfect fluid rotating rigidly around the boundary sphere .",
    "the fluid has vanishing shear but non - vanishing rotation .",
    "this seems surprising : the perfect fluid form should be the leading order result but one would have expected higher derivative corrections to the energy - momentum tensor . in particular",
    "one might have expected terms constructed from the fluid rotation . using our formalism",
    ", we again find that this result does not constrain any three - derivative terms but it does constrain transport coefficients at four derivatives .",
    "the rt solutions have a null geodesic congruence with vanishing shear and rotation .",
    "there exists a larger family of algebraically special solutions for which the shear vanishes but not the rotation .",
    "the dependence of the bulk metric on a `` radial '' coordinate ( an affine parameter along the geodesics ) is known explicitly , with the einstein equation reducing to certain pdes constraining the dependence on the other coordinates ( i.e. the `` boundary '' coordinates ) .",
    "we briefly comment below on some results on the dual cft interpretation of this family of solutions . in this case ,",
    "the cft lives in a 2 + 1 dimensional spacetime which is rotating : ds^2 = -(t + a_i(t , x ) x^i)^2 + e^2(t , x )    can be written as the sum of a perfect fluid part , with the fluid at rest in the above coordinates , and the same three - derivative term constructed from the curvature of the boundary metric as we discussed above .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "we review some properties of rt spacetimes in section [ rt - section ] and study the energy - momentum tensor of their dual cft state .",
    "as we are interested in studying also the dual cft stress tensor in view of the fluid / gravity correspondence , in section [ section - conf - fluids-3-dim ] we introduce our aforemontioned formalism to study conformal fluids in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "we apply the formalism to the rt case in section [ section - rt - fluid - gravity ] and to the kerr - ads case in section [ kerr - ads - section ] . in section [ conclusions ]",
    "we discuss algebraically special solutions with non - vanishing rotation and suggest possible future directions for research .",
    "robinson - trautman spacetimes @xcite are an important class of exact solutions of the einstein equations .",
    "they are defined by the existence of a geodesic , shear - free , twist - free but expanding null congruence . according to the goldberg - sachs theorem ,",
    "all such spacetimes are algebraically special in the vacuum case , with the defining null congruence being a repeated principal null direction .    in standard form ,",
    "the metric satisfying the above properties with a negative cosmological constant @xmath10 can be written as @xcite ds^2 = - u^2 - 2 u r + r^2 g_(2 ) g_(2 ) = , [ rt - metric ] with = k - 2r _ u p - + . where @xmath11 is a constant , k = p = 2p^2 _ _ @xmath12 is the laplacian of a two - dimensional manifold with metric @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the gaussian curvature of this metric ( i.e. half the ricci scalar ) .",
    "the function @xmath15 , must obey the _ robinson - trautman equation _ ,",
    "_ u p = - k [ rt - eqn ] which guarantees that the metric ( [ rt - metric ] ) is a solution of the vacuum einstein equations g_ab = g_ab .",
    "note that the rt equation is independent of the cosmological constant . for simplicity , we will from now on choose units such that the ads scale is set to unity , @xmath16 .",
    "we will assume that the coordinates @xmath17 parameterize a compact two - dimensional manifold @xmath18 , e.g @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "the coordinates @xmath21 are analogous to outgoing eddington - finkelstein coordinates for the schwarzschild solution with @xmath22 tangent to the ( affinely parameterized ) outgoing null geodesics with vanishing shear and rotation , and positive expansion .",
    "there is a curvature singularity at @xmath23 .",
    "the above metric admits a timelike conformal boundary at @xmath24 with topology @xmath25 .",
    "the boundary metric can be chosen to be ds^2 = -u^2 + g_(2 ) which can be interpreted as an inhomogeneous cosmological spacetime . in general , the boundary metric is not conformally flat so the solution is not asymptotically ads in the usual sense .",
    "according to ads / cft , the dual cft lives in this 2 + 1 dimensional geometry .    the schwarzschild - ads solution is recovered from the rt metric by taking @xmath13 to be a time - independent metric of constant unit curvature : p = p_0 ( , ) 1 + . with @xmath26 corresponding to spherical , planar , or hyperbolic symmetry .",
    "in the general case it is convenient to write p = e^-(u , , ) p_0 ( , ) [ p - f - def ] so the rt equation becomes an equation for @xmath4 .",
    "the parabolic nature of the rt equation implies that it comes with a preferred direction of time @xcite .",
    "we assume that @xmath27 .",
    "then , given initial data specified by a smooth function @xmath28 , there exists a unique solution of the rt equation for @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , this solution is _ analytic _ in @xmath17 for all @xmath30 .",
    "then the solution is a real analytic function of @xmath31 . ] hence if we are given smooth but non - analytic data @xmath28 then there will exist no corresponding solution of the rt solution for @xmath32 .    given arbitrary smooth initial data @xmath28 , it has been shown that the corresponding solution @xmath33 converges exponentially fast to a constant @xmath34 as @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "this holds for @xmath18 of arbitrary genus .",
    "the rt equation is volume preserving , i.e. , the volume of @xmath18 with metric @xmath13 is constant .",
    "this determines the value of the constant @xmath34 . by a rescaling of the coordinates @xmath36",
    "one can arrange that @xmath37 .",
    "the rate of convergence is determined by the first non - zero eigenvalue @xmath38 of the laplacian of the metric corresponding to @xmath39 on @xmath18 : = o(e^-_1 u/(12 m ) ) .",
    "since @xmath40 corresponds to the schwarzschild - ads solution , we can say that rt solutions `` settle down '' to the schwarzschild - ads solution with mass parameter @xmath11 as @xmath35 . since @xmath41 corresponds to the future event horizon @xmath42 of the schwarzschild - ads solution , it is natural to try to extend the rt spacetime across the null hypersurface @xmath41 by gluing to it the part of the schwarzschild - ads solution that lies beyond @xmath42 .    in the case of vanishing cosmological constant",
    ", it has been shown @xcite ( cf . also @xcite ) that the resulting spacetime is not smooth at @xmath41 : the metric is @xmath43 but not @xmath44 there and , generically , this is the smoothest possible @xcite . ]",
    "this level of smoothness seems physically acceptable .",
    "a negative cosmological constant , however , reduces the smoothness of the extension . in particular , for @xmath45 , there exists no @xmath46 extension @xcite",
    ". we will be interested mainly in the case of large @xmath11 ( which is required for validity of the fluid / gravity correspondence ) so we will assume that no @xmath46 extension exists , i.e. , @xmath41 corresponds to a null singularity .",

    "we can circumvent this problem by applying time reversal : set @xmath49 to bring the metric to the form ds^2 = - t^2 + 2 t r + r^2 g_(2 ) g_(2 ) = , [ rt - metric2 ] = k + 2r _ t p - + r^2 . and the rt equation is _",

    "an extension could be constructed by specifying initial data in the bulk on the @xmath56 hypersurface to be that given by the rt solution .",

    "such a flow does not satisfy the equation of motion of a conformal perfect fluid except in the special case for which the boundary geometry is time - independent .",
    "however , the presence of the three - derivative curvature term in ( [ rt - stress - tensor ] ) ensures that the full energy - momentum tensor is conserved , @xmath72 , _ provided _ the function @xmath68 ( equivalently @xmath4 ) appearing in the boundary metric ( [ boundary ] ) satisfies the rt equation .    as @xmath62 ,",
    "@xmath58 so the boundary becomes conformally flat and hence the curvature term vanishes at early time . so in the far past , the energy - momentum tensor is that of a thermal state at temperature @xmath73 . at finite @xmath74 ,",
    "it becomes non - thermal because of the time - dependence of the spacetime .",
    "the surprising feature of the result ( [ rt - stress - tensor ] ) is that it depends _ locally _ on the metric . for a fixed `` in '' state",

    "/ cft perspective , this is because the boundary metric at a point @xmath76 in the past light cone of @xmath75 affects the bulk geometry near @xmath76 and bulk scattering leads to information from @xmath76 propagating to @xmath75 .",
    "however , this does not happen here .",
    "the reason is that the algebraically special property ensures that radiation in the bulk is purely ingoing : there is no reflection back to the boundary .",
    "this is obviously non - generic , i.e. , fine - tuned .",
    "this fine - tuning amounts to requiring that the function @xmath4 in the boundary metric should satisfy the rt equation .",

    "fluid dynamics is an effective description of an interacting field theory characterized by a simple set of variables . in the simplest , uncharged case , these variables are a temperature field @xmath77 and a velocity field @xmath78 which is unit - normalized , @xmath79 .",
    "these vary on a scale @xmath80 much larger than the characteristic interaction scale @xmath81 , set by the mean free path , for example . as a consequence",
    ", derivatives of @xmath82 and @xmath83 are increasingly smaller and fluid dynamics can be described in an expansion in derivatives of the dynamical variables .",

    "[ stress - tensor - conservation ] for an uncharged fluid , @xmath84 is completely determined by the @xmath2 degrees of freedom contained in @xmath82 and @xmath83 . supplementing ( [ stress - tensor - conservation ] ) with an expression for @xmath84 written in terms of the fluid variables thus constitutes a well - defined dynamical system , the relativistic fluid dynamical equations .",

    "for conformal fluids , the stress tensor must be traceless ( at all orders ) , which imposes that = 2 p and that all @xmath87 must be traceless .",
    "conformal covariance also dictates the form of the equation of state , which can be obtained by dimensional analysis : p t^3 .",

    "it is usually convenient to fix this ambiguity , and the standard and natural way of doing this for uncharged fluids is by working in _ landau frame _ , which aligns the fluid velocity with the energy flow .",
    "more precisely , the velocity is defined to be the unique ( future - directed , unit - normalized ) timelike eigenvector of the stress tensor , t_ab u^b = - u_a , and the temperature is defined by identifying the corresponding eigenvalue with the energy density .",
    "this implies that the dissipative part is then transverse to @xmath83 , and hence @xmath90 for all @xmath88 .    in landau frame , the form of @xmath87 is then restricted to be a linear combination of independent symmetric , traceless @xmath89 tensors that contain @xmath88 derivatives of the fluid variables , are transverse to @xmath83 and transform homogeneously under conformal transformations . by independent we mean those tensors that are not related to each other by geometric relations such as bianchi identities or by the equations of motion ( [ stress - tensor - conservation ] ) .",

    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    at first order",
    ", one finds that the equations of motion can be used to eliminate all derivatives of the temperature ( equivalently the pressure ) in terms of derivatives of the velocity .",

    "thus one deals only with scalars and partial derivatives , making the task of classifying the terms at high orders much simpler .    after projecting the relevant fluid dynamical and curvature tensor fields along the basis and using the ricci identities ( see appendix [ ghp - like - section ] for details )",
    ", one finds only seven independent scalars , summarized in table [ indep - scalars ] .",
    "apart from the pressure @xmath75 , the fluid data comprises three scalars built from the fluid velocity : @xmath114 correspond to the two independent components of the shear and @xmath115 corresponds to the single independent component of the vorticity .",
    "one can also build scalars from the curvature involve not just the riemann tensor of the metric , but also contributions from derivatives of the velocity . ] : the @xmath116 in table [ indep - scalars ] are three particular components of the weyl covariant ricci tensor @xmath117 defined in ref .",

    "( [ curly - ricci ] ) of appendix [ weyl - cov - formalism ] ) .",
    "not all the curvature scalars and the relevant connection components are independent , for they are related by bianchi identities and the analogs of the newman - penrose equations .",
    "the latter are obtained by considering the ricci identity ( d_c d_d - d_d d_c ) x_b = - _ abcd x^a - ( w f_cd + is h_cd ) x_b , putting @xmath118 and taking components along the basis vectors .",
    "one obtains & = & _ 2 , + & = & f_0 , + _0 & = & - 2 ( | - ^2 ) , + - i & = & _ 1 - f_1 , + h_1 & = & i ( _ 1 + f_1 ) , + h_0 & = & _ 0 + _0 + | - ^2 , together with the complex - conjugate relations , when appropriate .",
    "the first two of these are equations for the propagation of shear and rotation , respectively , whereas the third is equivalent to raychaudhuri s equation ( describing the propagation of the expansion ) in three dimensions .",
    "we can then see that all the @xmath119- and @xmath120-scalars , together with @xmath121 , can be eliminated in terms of other curvature and connection scalars .",
    "we can then consider the commutator of two derivatives acting on a scalar @xmath101 of weight @xmath104 , ( d_a d_b - d_b d_a ) q = - ( w f_ab + is h_ab ) q , and take the nontrivial components along the basis to find ( - ) q & = & i q - q - 2w ( _ 1 - + i ) q + s ( 2 _ 1 - + i ) q , + ( - ) q & = & - i q - | q - 2w ( |_1 - | - i ) q - s ( 2 |_1 - | - i ) q , + ( - ) q & = & -2i q + ( 2iw - s _ 0 ) q.    the relevant bianchi identities are d_[e _ |ab|cd ] = 0 , d_[a f_bc ] = 0 , d_[a h_bc ] = 0 .",
    "taking components gives the following equations : 0 & = & ( _ 1 - f_1 ) - ( _0 - if_0 ) - _ 2 + ( |_1 + |f_1 ) + i ( _ 1 + f_1 ) , + 0 & = & ( _ 0 + _0 ) - ( |_1 + |f_1 ) - ( _ 1 + f_1 ) + |_2 + | _ 2 - f_0 , + 0 & = & f_0",
    "-i |f_1 + i f_1 , + 0 & = & h_0 -i |h_1 + i h_1 . using the eliminations provided by the newman - penrose equations , one finds that the bianchi identities reduce to the following two non - redundant equations : 0 & = & _ 1 - |_1 + ^2 | - ^2 - i ( ^2 - - ) , + 0 & = & _ 0 - 2 |_1 - 2 _ 1 + ^2 | + ^2 + 4 .        veronika e. hubeny , shiraz minwalla and mukund rangamani , _ the fluid / gravity correspondence _ , in : _ black holes in higher dimensions _ , edited by gary t. horowitz , cambridge university press ( 2012 ) . arxiv:1107.5780    a.  mukhopadhyay , a.  c.  petkou , p.  m.  petropoulos , v.  pozzoli and k.  siampos , _ holographic perfect fluidity , cotton energy - momentum duality and transport properties , _",
