    "multipole moments play an important role in newtonian gravity and maxwellian electrodynamics . conceptually , there are two distinct notions of multipole moments source multipoles which encode the distribution of mass ( or charge - current ) , and field multipoles which arise as coefficients in the asymptotic expansions of fields . in newtonian gravity ,",
    "the first set is of direct interest to equations of motion of extended bodies while the second determines the gravitational potential outside sources .",
    "however , via field equations one can easily relate the two sets of multipoles . in the maxwell theory , the rate of change of the source dipole moment is directly related to the energy flux measured at infinity . because of such useful properties",
    ", there has been considerable interest in extending these notions to general relativity .",
    "results of the maxwell theory were extended to the weak field regime of general relativity i.e . , linearized gravity quite some time ago . already in 1916",
    "einstein obtained the celebrated formula relating the rate of change of the quadrupole moment of the source to the energy flux at infinity @xcite . in the fifties , sachs and bergmann extended the relation between the source multipoles and asymptotic fields @xcite .",
    "however , in the framework of _ exact _ general relativity , progress has been slow . in the seventies ,",
    "geroch , hansen and others @xcite restricted themselves to the stationary context and introduced field multipoles by analyzing the asymptotic structure of suitable geometric fields constructed from the metric and equations they satisfy near spatial infinity . as in electrodynamics",
    "and , in contrast to the situation in the newtonian theory they found that there are _ two _ sets of multipoles , the mass multipoles @xmath3 and the angular momentum multipoles @xmath4 . in static situations ,",
    "all the angular momentum multipoles @xmath4 vanish and the mass multipoles @xmath3 are constructed from the norm of the static killing field which , like the newtonian gravitational potential , satisfies a laplace - type equation outside sources .",
    "in the ( genuinely ) stationary context , the @xmath4 are non - zero and are analogous to the magnetic multipoles in the maxwell theory . in the newtonian theory ,",
    "since the field multipoles are defined as coefficients in the @xmath5 expansion of the gravitational potential , knowing all multipoles one can trivially reconstruct the potential outside sources . in general relativity , there are considerable coordinate ambiguities in performing asymptotic expansions of the metric .",
    "therefore , geroch and hansen were led to define their multipoles using other techniques .",
    "nonetheless , beig and simon @xcite have established that the knowledge of these multipoles does suffice to determine the space - time geometry near infinity .",
    "their construction also shows that , if two stationary space - times have the same multipoles , they are isometric in a neighborhood of infinity .    in the geroch - hansen framework ,",
    "one works on the 3-dimensional manifold of orbits of the stationary killing field and multipole moments @xmath3 and the @xmath4 arise as symmetric , trace - free tensors in the tangent space of the point @xmath6 at spatial infinity of this manifold .",
    "now , the vector space of n - th rank , symmetric traceless tensors on @xmath7 is naturally isomorphic with the vector space spanned by the linear combinations @xmath8 of spherical harmonics on the unit sphere @xmath9 in @xmath7",
    ". therefore , each @xmath3 and @xmath4 uniquely defines a set of numbers , @xmath10 and @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "finally , let us consider stationary space - times which are also axi - symmetric ( e.g. , the kerr space - time )",
    ". then @xmath13 and @xmath14 , whence multipoles are completely characterized by two sets of numbers , @xmath15 with @xmath16",
    ". this fact will be useful to us because most of our analysis will be restricted to axi - symmetric isolated horizons .    in stationary space - times , then , the situation with field multipoles is quite analogous to that in the newtonian theory .",
    "the status of source multipoles , on the other hand , has not been so satisfactory .",
    "dixon developed a framework to define source multipoles @xcite but the program did not reach the degree of maturity enjoyed by the field multipoles . on the other hand",
    ", it is the source multipoles , rather than the field multipoles defined at infinity , that appear to be more directly relevant to the motion of extended bodies in general relativity .",
    "( for recent discussions , see @xcite . ) in particular , it would be interesting to obtain useful generalizations of the quadrupole formula to fully relativistic objects such as neutron stars and black holes .",
    "is there , for example , a relation between the flux of energy falling across the horizon and the rate of change of the quadrupole moment of a black hole ? to analyze such issues",
    "one needs a reliable definition of the source quadrupole moment , and more generally , of source multipoles .    in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the problem of defining the analogs of source multipoles for black holes in equilibrium .",
    "the isolated horizon framework provides a suitable quasi - local arena for describing such black holes @xcite .",
    "thus , our task is to introduce an appropriate definition of multipoles which capture distortions of the horizon geometry and of the distribution of angular momentum currents on the horizon itself , and explore properties of these multipoles .",
    "do these multipoles provide a diffeomorphism invariant characterization of the horizon geometry ?",
    "if so , they may play a significant role in the analysis of equations of motion .",
    "do they suffice to determine space - time geometry in the neighborhood of the horizon in stationary space - times ?",
    "these are attractive possibilities .",
    "but since the horizon lies in a genuinely strong field region , a priori it is not obvious that a useful notion of multipoles can be introduced at all . indeed ,",
    "since the problem of defining and analyzing multipoles has turned out to be so difficult already for relativistic fluids , at first glance it may seem hopelessly difficult for black holes .",
    "however , a tremendous simplification occurs because black holes are purely geometric objects ; one does not have to resolve the messy and difficult issues related to the details of matter sources .",
    "we will see that this simplification makes it possible to carry out a detailed analysis and satisfactorily address the issues raised above .",
    "we will restrict our detailed analysis to axi - symmetric ( or type ii ) isolated horizons , where the symmetry restriction applies only to the horizon geometry ( and to the pull - back of the maxwell field to the horizon ) and not to the entire space - time .",
    "the material is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ s2 ] , we recall the relevant facts about isolated horizons and axi - symmetric geometric structures . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we define the multipoles @xmath0 and @xmath1 and show that these two sets of numbers provide a complete characterization of the isolated horizon geometry . for the specific case of maxwell sources ,",
    "we introduce another pair , @xmath17 of electromagnetic multipoles and show that they suffice to determine the pull - back of the maxwell tensor as well as that of its dual .",
    "finally , the initial value formulation based on two intersecting null surfaces @xcite implies that , if there is a stationary killing field in the neighborhood of the horizon , multipoles also suffice to determine the near horizon geometry @xcite . in section [ s4 ] , we discuss potential extensions and applications of the framework ranging from numerical relativity to quantum gravity .    unless otherwise stated , in this paper all manifolds and fields will be assumed to be smooth .",
    "in this sub - section we briefly recall the relevant notions pertaining to isolated horizons @xcite .",
    "this discussion will also serve to fix our notation .",
    "let us begin with the basic definitions @xcite .",
    "a _ non - expanding horizon _",
    "@xmath18 is a null , 3-dimensional sub - manifold of the 4-dimensional space - time @xmath19 , with topology @xmath20 , such that : + i ) the expansion @xmath21 of its null normal @xmath22 vanishes ; and , + ii ) field equations hold on @xmath18 with stress energy , @xmath23 , satisfying the very weak requirement that @xmath24 is a future - directed , causal vector .",
    "( throughout , @xmath25 will be assumed to be future pointing . )    before discussing their consequences , let us note two facts about these assumptions : i ) if the expansion vanishes for one null normal , it vanishes for all ; and , ii ) the condition on the stress energy is satisfied by all the standard matter fields provided they are minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "( non - minimally coupled matter can be incorporated by a small modification of this condition .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite . ) since @xmath18 is a null 3-surface , its intrinsic ` metric ' @xmath26 has signature 0,+,+ .",
    "the definition ensures that @xmath27 and @xmath28 , _ where @xmath29 denotes equality restricted to points of @xmath30_. in particular , the area of any 2-sphere cross - section is constant on @xmath18",
    ". we will denote it by @xmath31 .",
    "the definition also implies that the space - time derivative operator @xmath32 naturally induces a unique derivative operator @xmath33 on @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath34 for some globally defined 1-form @xmath35 on the horizon .",
    "this 1-form will play an important role .    the pair @xmath36 is referred to as the intrinsic _ geometry _ of @xmath18 .",
    "the notion that the black hole itself is in equilibrium is captured by requiring that this geometry is time independent : + an _ isolated horizon _",
    "@xmath37)$ ] is a non - expanding horizon @xmath18 equipped with an equivalence class of null normals @xmath25 , where @xmath38 if and only if @xmath39 for a positive constant @xmath40 , such that @xmath41 \\= 0 $ ] on @xmath18 .",
    ", one can show that , generically , there is an unique equivalence class @xmath42 $ ] of null normals such that @xmath43)$ ] is an isolated horizon .",
    "however , our analysis will not be restricted to this case . ] since @xmath30 is a null surface , given any one null normal @xmath25 in @xmath42 $ ] , we have @xmath44 for some @xmath45 .",
    "( thus , @xmath46 . )",
    "the requirement @xmath47 \\= 0 $ ] further implies that @xmath45 is constant on @xmath18 .",
    "it is referred to as the _ surface gravity _ of @xmath18 with respect to @xmath48 .",
    "note that if @xmath49 then @xmath50 .",
    "thus , the _ value _ of surface gravity refers to a specific null normal ; it is not a property of @xmath51)$ ] .",
    "however , one _ can _ unambiguously say whether the given isolated horizon is _ extremal _",
    "( i.e. , has @xmath52 ) or _ non - extremal _",
    "( i.e. , has @xmath53 ) .",
    "the isolated horizon definition extracts from the notion of the killing horizon just that ` tiny ' part which turns out to be essential for black hole mechanics @xcite and , more generally , to capture the notion that the horizon is in equilibrium , allowing for dynamical processes and radiation in the exterior region @xcite .",
    "indeed , einstein s equations admit solutions with isolated horizons in which there is radiation arbitrarily close to the horizons @xcite .",
    "finally , note that the definition uses conditions which are _ local _ to @xmath18 .",
    "hence , unlike event horizons one does not require the knowledge of full space - time ; the notion is not ` teleological ' .    of particular interest to our analysis",
    "is the case when the only matter present _ at _ the horizon is a maxwell field . in this case",
    ", only the _ pull - backs _ @xmath54 and @xmath55 to @xmath18 , respectively of the maxwell field @xmath56 and its dual @xmath57 are needed in the isolated horizon analysis .",

    "_ this is why the quadruplet @xmath63 , defined intrinsically on @xmath18 , was singled out to introduce the notion of einstein - maxwell horizon geometry . _",
    "all equations that are required in the derivation of the laws of mechanics of isolated horizons in einstein - maxwell theory @xcite as well as the main results of this paper refer just to these fields .",
    "next , let us examine symmetry groups of isolated horizons .",
    "a _ symmetry _ of @xmath64 is a diffeomorphism on @xmath18 which preserves @xmath65 and @xmath55 and at most rescales @xmath25 by a positive constant .",
    "it is clear that diffeomorphisms generated by @xmath25 are symmetries .",
    "so , the symmetry group @xmath66 is at least 1-dimensional .",
    "the question is : are there any other symmetries ? at infinity , we generally have a universal symmetry group ( such as the poincar or the anti - de sitter ) because all metrics under consideration approach a fixed metric ( minkowskian or anti - de sitter ) there . in the case of the isolated horizons ,",
    "generically we are in the strong field regime and space - time metrics do not approach a universal metric .",
    "therefore , the symmetry group is not universal .",
    "however , there are only three universality classes : + i ) type i : the isolated horizon geometry is spherical ; in this case , @xmath66 is four dimensional ; + ii ) type ii : the isolated horizon geometry is axi - symmetric ; in this case , @xmath66 is two dimensional ; + iii ) type iii : the diffeomorphisms generated by @xmath25 are the only symmetries ; @xmath66 is one dimensional .",
    "note that these symmetries refer _ only to _ the horizon geometry .",
    "the full space - time metric need not admit any isometries even in a neighborhood of the horizon .",
    "physically , type ii horizons are the most interesting ones .",
    "they include the kerr - newman horizons as well as their generalizations incorporating distortions ( due to exterior matter or other black holes ) and hair .",
    "our main results refer to the type ii case .",
    "finally , one can use the field equations to isolate the _",
    "freely specifiable data _ which determines the einstein - maxwell geometry of an isolated horizon @xcite . the analysis is naturally divided in to two cases : @xmath53 and @xmath67 .",
    "fix any 2-sphere cross - section @xmath68 of @xmath18 and denote by @xmath69 the natural projection operator on @xmath68 .",
    "then , on any type ii horizon , we have the following .. ]    * in the _ non - extremal case _ , the free data consists of the projections @xmath70 to @xmath68 ( using @xmath69 ) of @xmath71 on @xmath18 .",
    "( recall that @xmath35 is defined by @xmath72 . )",
    "that is , given the free data on @xmath68 , using the projections of the field equations on @xmath68 , one can reconstruct the full einstein - maxwell geometry @xmath73 on @xmath18 .",
    "* in the _ extremal _ case , remarkably , the fields @xmath74 and @xmath55 turn out to be all _ universal _ ; they are the same as those in the extremal kerr - newman geometry @xcite ! the free data consists of @xmath75 , a symmetric , second rank tensor on @xmath68 , determined by @xmath33 via @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the covariant normal to @xmath68 within @xmath18 , satisfying @xmath78 .",
    "( thus , @xmath79 is the analog of the  extrinsic curvature of @xmath68 within @xmath18 . )",
    "given a kerr - newman quadruplet @xmath74 and @xmath55 the only freedom in the einstein - maxwell horizon geometry lies in the part of @xmath33 which determines the ` extrinsic curvature ' @xmath79 of @xmath68",
    ".    these results will play an important role in section 3 . specifically",
    ", we will construct multipoles from the free data and show that they provide a diffeomorphism invariant characterization of the free data and hence , via field equations , of the horizon geometry .      in this sub - section",
    "we will recall a few facts about axi - symmetric geometries on @xmath9 .",
    "this discussion will also make our assumptions explicit .",
    "let @xmath80 be a manifold with the topology of a 2-sphere , equipped with a metric @xmath81 .",
    "we will denote by @xmath82 the alternating tensor on @xmath80 compatible with @xmath83 , by @xmath84 the area of @xmath80 and by @xmath85 its radius , defined by @xmath86 .",
    "we will say that @xmath87 is _ axi - symmetric _ if it admits a killing field @xmath88 with closed orbits which vanishes _ exactly _ at two points of @xmath80 .",
    "the two points will be referred to as _ poles_. we will now show that such metric manifolds carry invariantly defined coordinates and discuss properties of the metric coefficients in these coordinates .    since @xmath89",
    ", there exists a unique ( globally defined ) function @xmath90 on @xmath80 such that [ zeta]_a = _",
    "ba ^b _  = 0 .it is clear that @xmath91 and @xmath92 vanishes _ only _ at the poles .",
    "hence , @xmath90 is a monotonic function on the 1-dimensional manifold @xmath93 of orbits of @xmath88 .",
    "now @xmath94 is a closed interval and the end points correspond to the two poles .",
    "hence @xmath90 monotonically increases from one pole to another .",
    "we will say that @xmath90 assumes its minimum value at the _ south pole _ and the maximum at the _",
    "north pole_.    next , let us introduce a vector field @xmath95 on @xmath96 via : _",
    "ab ^a ^b = 0 ^a_a = 1then it follows that [ zetaa]^a = ^ab _ b , where @xmath97 is the squared norm of @xmath88 .",
    "hence integral curves of @xmath95 go from the south pole to the north ( and @xmath95 diverges as one approaches the poles ) . using @xmath95",
    ", we can define a preferred affine parameter @xmath98 of @xmath88 as follows : fix any one integral curve @xmath99 of @xmath95 in @xmath100 and set @xmath101 on @xmath99 .",
    "thus , on @xmath99 , we have @xmath102 .",
    "now , since @xmath88 is a killing field and @xmath95 is constructed uniquely from @xmath103 , it follows that @xmath104 .",
    "hence , we conclude : @xmath105 .",
    "since @xmath106 on @xmath99 , it now follows that @xmath107 on _ every _ orbit of @xmath95 .",
    "this now implies that the affine parameter @xmath98 of @xmath88 has the same range on every orbit of @xmath88 . on @xmath100 but",
    "the additional steps are straightforward . ] without loss of generality we will assume that @xmath88 is such that @xmath108 on @xmath80 .",
    "thus , starting from geometry , we have constructed two coordinates @xmath109 on @xmath80 such that @xmath110 and @xmath111 are orthogonal . eqs ( [ zeta ] ) and ( [ zetaa ] ) now imply that the metric has the form : [ q ] _ ab = r^2(f^-1 d_a d_b+ f d_a d_b ) ^ab = ( f ^a ^b + f^-1 ^a ^b ) where @xmath112 . the fact that the area of @xmath80 is @xmath113 now implies that the range of @xmath90 is necessarily @xmath114 $ ] .",
    "conversely , given any ` coordinates ' @xmath115 in @xmath114\\times \\r/2\\pi { \\mathbb z}$ ] in which the metric can be expressed in ( the primed version of ) the form ( [ q ] ) , it is easy to show that @xmath116 and @xmath117 is at most a rigid shift of @xmath98 .",
    "( for an analogous construction in newman - penrose notation , see @xcite . )",
    "functions @xmath118 serve as ` coordinates ' on @xmath80 modulo usual caveats : they are ill - defined at the poles and @xmath98 has a @xmath119 discontinuity on the integral curve @xmath99 of @xmath95 . we have to ensure that the metric @xmath83 is smooth in spite of these coordinate problems .",
    "the discontinuity at @xmath99 causes no problems .",
    "however , poles do require a careful treatment because the norm @xmath120 of @xmath88 and hence @xmath121 vanishes there .",
    "smoothness of @xmath83 at the poles ( i.e. absence of conical singularities ) imposes a non - trivial condition on @xmath121 : [ bc ] _ 1 f ( ) = 2",
    "where ` prime ' denotes derivative with respect to @xmath90 . on a metric 2-sphere",
    ", we have @xmath122 and we can bring the metric to the standard form simply by setting @xmath123 . in the general case , @xmath121 has the same values and first derivatives at the poles as on a metric 2-sphere . using lhopital s rule",
    ", one can show that this fact suffices to ensure that the metric ( [ q ] ) is smooth at the poles .",
    "finally , we note a property of these axi - symmetric metrics which will be useful in section [ s3.2 ] .",
    "a simple calculation shows that the scalar curvature @xmath124 of @xmath83 is given by : [ tr ] ( , ) = - f  ( ) . by integrating it twice with respect to @xmath90 _ and using the boundary conditions _ @xmath125 and @xmath126",
    ", one can reconstruct the function @xmath121 from the scalar curvature : f = - r^2 + 2(+1 ) thus , thanks to the preferred coordinates admitted by an axi - symmetric geometry on @xmath80 , given the area @xmath84 of @xmath80 and the scalar curvature @xmath124 , the metric @xmath83 is completely determined .",
    "_ remark : _ coordinates @xmath127 , determined by the axi - symmetry of @xmath83 , also enable us to define a _",

    "this round metric captures the extra structure made available by axi - symmetry in a coordinate invariant way .",
    "the availability of @xmath128 enables one to perform a natural spherical harmonic decomposition on @xmath80 .",
    "this fact will play a key role throughout section [ s3 ] .",
    "this section is divided into four parts . in the first three , we restrict ourselves to non - extremal , type ii isolated horizons with no matter fields on them .",
    "we begin in the first part by defining a set of multipoles , @xmath130 , starting from the horizon geometry .",

    "remark : _ if non - electromagnetic sources are also present , we can still define the gravitational ( and electromagnetic ) multipoles as above but the multipoles for other sources have to be defined case by case . gravitational multipoles again determine the ` free data ' for the horizon geometry @xmath36 .",
    "however , to reconstruct the horizon geometry from this data , one needs to know those matter fields which determine the components @xmath310 of the ricci tensor , evaluated at the horizon .",
    "let us now summarize the situation with extremal horizons . in this case ,",
    "important modifications are needed in the gravitational sector .",
    "as noted in section [ s2.1 ] , surprisingly , @xmath311 are now _ universal _ , determined by the kerr - newman family @xcite .",
    "however , they no longer suffice to determine the derivative operator @xmath33 on the horizon because the second rank , symmetric tensor field @xmath312 is now free @xcite ( see appendix a ) .",
    "therefore , multipole moments characterizing the free data in the geometry have to be constructed from components of @xmath313 . again , as with @xmath132 , there is a gauge freedom in @xmath313 associated with the choice of the cross - section @xmath68 used to evaluate it .",
    "this can be eliminated by fixing the trace of @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "then the gauge invariant information is coded in the two components of the trace - free part of @xmath79 .    of course , we can still use @xmath161 to introduce the geometric multipoles @xmath219 and electromagnetic multipoles @xmath314 .",
    "but they are universal ; the same as in the extremal kerr - newman case . however , now there are _ two additional sets of geometric multipoles _ obtained by integrating the two independent components of @xmath315 against @xmath316 .",
    "they capture the free data which can vary from one extremal isolated horizon to another .",
    "to our knowledge , they do not have a simple , direct physical interpretation .",
    "the notion of the horizon geometry and the calculations leading to the free data do not refer to the axial killing field at all @xcite ( see appendix a ) . in the above , we restricted ourselves to type ii horizons primarily because they are the ones which are physically most interesting . on a non - extremal type iii horizon",
    ", the complex - valued seed function @xmath161 again captures the gauge invariant part of the free data . which , in the type ii case led to the surprising result that these fields must coincide with those on an extremal kerr isolated horizon .",
    "] however , in absence of axi - symmetry , we no longer have the natural coordinate @xmath90 .",
    "@xmath161 is now a function of two coordinates on @xmath68 .",
    "nonetheless , we can use the laplacian operator @xmath317 on @xmath68 to decompose @xmath161 in to generalized spherical harmonics .",
    "thus , now the geometric multipoles @xmath318 are labelled by two integers where @xmath184 labels the discrete eigenvalue of the laplacian and @xmath319 is the degeneracy label of eigenvectors with same eigenvalue @xmath184 of the laplacian . should a physically interesting application of type iii horizons arise , it should not be difficult to extend this basic framework further",
    ".    there is , however , an important subtlety . in the type ii case ,",
    "the presence of axi - symmetry led us to single out a preferred function @xmath90 and our multipoles were defined using the @xmath197 associated with this @xmath90 . as noted in section [ s3 ] , these @xmath192 are spherical harmonics associated with the round 2-sphere metric @xmath128 of ( [ qo ] ) .",
    "in general , they are _ not _ eigenfunctions of the laplacian of the physical metric @xmath83 ! our procedure was essential to ensure that the angular momentum dipole @xmath273 agrees with the horizon angular momentum @xmath248 defined by hamiltonian methods @xcite .",
    "had we used multipoles through spherical harmonics associated with @xmath83 , this equality would not have held in general .",
    "thus the extra structure available on type ii horizons played an important role in our definition of multipoles in sections [ s3.1 ] and [ s3.3 ] .",
    "since it is absent on a general type iii horizon , multipoles defined using the physical laplacian will not have all the physically desirable properties discussed in section [ s3.3 ] .",
    "source multipoles in newtonian gravity characterize the way in which mass is distributed , higher multipoles providing a complete description of distortions , i.e. , departures from sphericity .",
    "multipole moments defined in this paper do the same for the horizon geometry . in this sense , they can be regarded as ` source multipoles ' associated with a black hole , distinct from the ` field multipoles ' defined at infinity . in newtonian gravity and maxwellian electrodynamics , there is a simple relation between the two because both these theories are ` abelian ' : the field does not serve as its own source . in",
    "non - abelian contexts such as yang - mills theory and general relativity , the field in the region between the source and infinity itself acts as an effective source .",
    "hence one would expect there to exist two _ distinct _ sets of multipoles , one associated with the central gravitating body and the other associated with the entire system .",
    "if space - time is stationary , one would expect a simple relation between mass monopoles , if it is axi - symmetric , between angular momentum dipoles and if in addition there is reflection symmetry , one would expect all odd mass multipoles and even angular momentum multipoles to vanish in _ both regimes_. however , in absence of symmetries , one does not expect a simple relation between the two sets in the fully relativistic regimes where post - newtonian and post - minkowskian approximations fail .",
    "this point seems to have been glossed over in the general relativity literature on applications of multipoles .",
    "since horizon multipoles were unavailable , one typically identified the field multipoles with the multipoles of the black hole and used them in _ all _ contexts .",
    "the horizon multipoles defined in this paper are likely to have three sets of applications which we now summarize .",
    "the first is to the problem of equations of motion . in the more recent literature on this subject",
    ", multipoles have been used in two different contexts .",
    "the first is illustrated by the problem of extreme mass - ratio binaries where a solar mass black hole orbits about a central supermassive one .",
    "for this case , there is an interesting framework @xcite enabling one to use gravitational wave observations to ` measure ' the gravitational multipole moments of the central object . in actual calculations",
    ", one typically assumes that the small hole is far from the supermassive one .",
    "one can then express the space - time metric at the position of the small hole as a series in inverse powers of distance from the central hole using the hansen field - multipoles as coefficients , and calculate quantities of physical interest . within the approximations inherent to these calculations , it is entirely appropriate to use the field multipoles and the framework provides a way of measuring _",
    "these _ multipoles from the gravitational wave data",
    ". however , the approximation will fail if the orbit lies in a genuinely strong field regime .",
    "in that case , one may be able to use the near horizon expansion of the metric @xcite . here",
    "expansion coefficients refer to the horizon geometry but it should be straightforward to recast them in terms of the horizon multipoles .",
    "the second context is illustrated in the study of how the gravitational field of _ other _ objects affects a given , small black hole ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "calculations of the resulting distortion , precession , spin - flips , etc . of the black hole require the knowledge of tidal forces and torques exerted by other bodies on the black hole .",
    "typically , these are calculated from interaction terms involving a coupling of black hole multipoles to perturbations in the weyl curvature caused by other objects ( at the location of the black hole ) . in these calculations",
    "it is inappropriate to use the _ field",
    "_ multipoles of the small black hole since the coupling occurs at the location of the black hole .",
    "what one needs is multipoles associated with the horizon , not coefficients in the asymptotic expansion of the metric produced by the small black hole alone .",
    "the horizon multipoles introduced here provide the appropriate notion .",
    "a second set of applications is to binary black hole simulations in numerical relativity . at very early times when the two black holes are widely separated and at late times when the single black hole has settled down ,",
    "the world tubes of apparent horizons are well approximated , within numerical errors , by isolated horizons .",
    "one often wants to compare results of two different numerical simulations , particularly at late times .",
    "these comparisons are generally difficult in the strong field regime because the results are tied to the coordinates used .",
    "our mass and angular momentum multipoles provide a diffeomorphism invariant method to compare such results . furthermore , when there are differences , they provide a tool to interpret them physically .",
    "a more interesting potential application is in the dynamical regimes , where the world tubes of apparent horizons can be modelled by dynamical horizons @xmath320 @xcite .",
    "these are naturally foliated by marginally trapped 2-spheres @xmath321 . on each @xmath321",
    ", there is an obvious , well - defined analog of @xmath161 .",
    "therefore , a natural strategy is to use it to define multipoles which would now be _ time - dependent_. it would be very interesting to analyze the evolution of these moments both analytically and numerically .",
    "for example , there is a well - defined notion of energy flux across any @xmath321 @xcite .",
    "is there then an analog of the quadrupole formula _ at the horizon _ ?",
    "from the knowledge of the horizon quadrupole and its relation to the kerr quadrupole , can one gain insight into the maximum amount of energy that can be emitted in gravitational radiation ? for non - rotating black holes , early numerical simulations",
    "@xcite introduced a notion of horizon multipoles , using tools then available .",
    "they then calculated a complex frequency describing the time evolution of the quadrupole , where the imaginary part of the frequency captures damping .",
    "they found that this frequency coincided with the quasi - normal frequency of the final black hole .",
    "although the calculation of multipoles was somewhat imprecise , the result is simple and intriguing .",
    "interestingly , our horizon multipoles provide a precise formulation of the physical ideas underlying those more intuitive notions of multipoles .",
    "one is therefore led to ask : can one analyze the final stages of mergers using the present , diffeomorphism invariant multipoles and show in detail that the complex frequency is the same as the quasi - normal one ?",
    "such a result would provide a deep insight in to the relation between the highly non - linear dynamics of the horizon and the quasi - normal ringing associated with the linear regime .",
    "again , the issue can be examined using analytical methods as well as numerical simulations .",
    "the final set of applications is to quantum gravity . to calculate black hole entropy from first principles",
    ", one needs to construct an ensemble , where the ` macroscopic parameters ' describing the system are fixed . to be physically meaningful",
    ", these parameters have to be diffeomorphism invariant . for type",
    "i horizons , this is straightforward : there is only one gravitational parameter , which can be taken to be the horizon area ( or mass ) . for type ii horizons , one can not just work with mass and angular momentum because the horizon may be distorted by various types of hair . even within the 4-dimensional einstein - maxwell theory where no - hair theorems hold ,",
    "distortions can be caused by matter rings and other black holes .",
    "even if the black hole itself is isolated , one can not automatically rely on uniqueness theorems and say that it must be a kerr hole because it is physically unreasonable to require that the whole space - time is stationary .",
    "since one wishes to calculate entropy of a black hole in equilibrium , one should only need to require that the horizon geometry is time independent , not the whole universe . to incorporate physically realistic situations ,",
    "then , one needs a diffeomorphism invariant characterization of the horizon fields .",
    "multipoles can now serve as the required parameters in the construction of the ensemble .",
    "it turns out that they can in fact be used to calculate entropy associated with type ii horizons @xcite .",

    "for convenience of the reader , in this appendix we will collect some results from @xcite which play an important role in this paper . specifically , we will show how the horizon geometry @xmath36 is determined by the free data via field equations .",
    "fix a 3-manifold @xmath18 , topologically @xmath20 and a 2-sphere cross - section @xmath68 thereon .",

    "( we will turn to the extremal case at the end . )",
    "introduce a function @xmath325 whose level surfaces provide a foliation of @xmath18 by a family of 2-spheres such that @xmath68 is a leaf .",
    "let @xmath326 and define a vector field @xmath25 such that @xmath327 .",
    "thus , @xmath25 is transversal to the foliation .",
    "now , given @xmath83 on @xmath68 , there is a unique tensor field @xmath26 on @xmath18 such that : q_ab ^b = 0,_q_ab = 0 , q_ab ^a ^b = _ ab ^a ^b for all vector fields @xmath328 tangential to @xmath68 .",
    "this is the required @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath33 we seek is to be the derivative operator on a non - extremal isolated horizon .",
    "so , it must satisfy : i ) @xmath329 , ii ) @xmath330 \\=0 $ ] , and iii ) @xmath331 for some 1-form @xmath35 where @xmath332 is non - zero .",
    "consider first torsion - free derivative operators @xmath33 on @xmath18 which are compatible with @xmath26 .",
    "they all have the same action on 1-forms @xmath333 satisfying @xmath334 , given by : _ a f_b = _",
    "|f q_ab + _ [ a f_b]where @xmath335 is any vector field on @xmath18 satisfying @xmath336 .",
    "( while @xmath335 is not unique , one can check that the first term on the right side is insensitive to this ambiguity . )",
    "what distinguishes these derivative operators is only their action on @xmath77 .",
    "set s_ab : = _ a n_b then , @xmath337 is symmetric and @xmath338 .",
    "thus , the freedom in the definition of @xmath33 is completely captured by the pair @xmath339 where @xmath313 is the projection of @xmath337 on the leaves of the foliation ( defined by the projection operator @xmath340 ) .",
    "we now bring in the pull - backs of the field equations to @xmath18 . a simple calculation yields : _ ab ^b = 2 ^a _ [ a _ b ] , where the underline denotes the pull - back to @xmath18 .",
    "now , conditions on the stress - energy tensor in the definition of a non - expanding horizon imply that @xmath341 whence @xmath342 . therefore , via the cartan identity , this part of the einstein equation is equivalent to : _ a ( _ b^b ) - _ _a 0 now , since @xmath343 \\=0 $ ] , it follows that @xmath344 , whence @xmath45 is constant on @xmath18 .",
    "the remaining projection of einstein s equations on @xmath18 determines how @xmath337 ` evolves ' along @xmath18 : [ ls ] _  _ ab = -_l _ ab + _ ( a _ b ) + _ a _ b - _ ab + _ a^c _ b^d r_cd where @xmath345 and @xmath346 denote the derivative operator and the ricci tensor on the leaves of the foliation and @xmath347 is the projection of @xmath35 on these cross - sections .",
    "however , since @xmath343 \\=0 $ ] , the left side vanishes .",
    "hence , _ if _ @xmath53 , we have : _ ab = .",
    "thus , given the part of the stress - tensor which determines the projection @xmath310 of the space - time ricci tensor on the leaves of the foliation , @xmath313 is completely determined by @xmath83 and @xmath132 . since @xmath348 and @xmath349 \\=0 $ ] , it follows that it suffices to specify @xmath131 only on one leaf of the foliation .    to summarize , in the non - extremal case , the field equations pulled - back to @xmath18 imply that @xmath33 is completely determined by @xmath350 and @xmath45 is a constant on @xmath18 .",
    "an examination of the other field equations shows that they do not constrain the horizon geometry ; rather , they provide evolution equations off @xmath18 .",

    "let us now turn to the extremal case .",
    "analysis is identical until ( [ ls ] ) .",
    "but , since @xmath352 vanishes , @xmath313 decouples from the equation and remains completely unconstrained .",
