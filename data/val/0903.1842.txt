    "low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes based on sparse graphs have emerged as a focal point in the theory of error correcting codes , used in noisy channel communication , largely because they are amenable to low complexity decoding and at the same time have a good performance ( measured as the gap to shannon s capacity ) .",
    "an important class of low complexity decoders are the message passing iterative decoders . in this framework , in order to decode a bit attached to a node of the graph , one unravels a computational tree ( or covering tree ) and iteratively updates messages ( suitable functions of the channel output observations ) passed along the edges of the computational tree .",
    "we refer to the recent book @xcite for the state of the art of this general theory .",
    "one would also like to be able to compare sub - optimal message passing decoders with the optimal or ideal decoder .",
    "the later is based on the posterior probability distribution supported on code - bits and is optimal in the sense that it is known to minimize the bit - error - rate among all decoders ( it is also called map decoder , and this is the terminology that we adopt in this paper ) .",
    "a priori the comparison of decoders is not easily done since the map decoder is in general computationaly complex .",
    "one of the most important low complexity message passing decoders is the belief propagation ( bp ) algorithm .",
    "it is well known that for a code whose graph is a tree , the bp algorithm has the same performance as the map decoder .",
    "this essentially comes from the fact that on a tree the computational graph of a node matches the original graph itself .",
    "however , codes based on tree graphs have poor performance and one needs to consider graphs with loops or cycles . with cycles in the original graph ,",
    "the messages on the computational tree are no longer independent , and it is not a priori clear , if and why , the bp algorithm should retain any close relationship to the map decoder .",
    "a fundamental theoretical tool that allows to analyze the bp algorithm is density evolution ( de ) first developed in @xcite . from de one",
    "can for example obtain a noise threshold above which reliable communication is not possible with bp decoding .",
    "the analysis proceeds by taking first a very large block length @xmath0 and looking at @xmath1 iterations of the bp decoder .",
    "eventualy one considers the asymptotics @xmath2 .",
    "however , in the practical use of the decoder one fixes @xmath0 ( large ) and the iterations @xmath3 are performed till one reaches an acceptably small bit - error - rate .",
    "this corresponds to the asymptotics @xmath4 .",
    "the practical success of density evolution relies on the equivalence of these two limiting procedures , an open problem in general .",
    "it is fair to say that these issues have been resolved over the binary erasure channel ( bec ) @xcite ( the analysis however has not proceeded from the point of view of the correlations of the map decoder ) .",
    "an important tool in the analysis over the bec has been the \" extended bp  extrinsic information transfer ( exit ) curve ( which is a suitable continuation of the bit - error - rate curve under bp decoding ) .",
    "recently it was shown that the bit - error - rate of the map decoder can be obtained from that of the extended bp exit curve by a maxwell construction just as in the theory of first order phase transitions @xcite , @xcite . this construction allows to compute the map noise threshold , and to compare it to the bp noise threshold .",
    "the validity of the exchange of limits @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( for the bp decoder ) can also be derived for the bec using natural monotonicity properties of the decoder @xcite .    for the case of transmission over more general channels",
    "very little is known about these issues .",
    "indeed there one lacks the combinatorial methods available for the bec , and radically new methods have to be used .",
    "convenient measures of the performance , which generalize the exit curves , are the so - called gexit curves @xcite ( see the next section for their precise definition ) .",
    "it is believed that in terms of these , the results obtained for the bec still hold .",
    "in particular , the gexit curves for the bp and the map decoder should match for high and low noise regimes away from the phase transition thresholds .",
    "such conjectures are supported by spin glass theory calculations ( e.g the replica and cavity methods ) which provide conjectural but analytic formulas .",
    "one - sided bounds have been derived for the gexit curves by the ( information theoretical ) method of physical degradation @xcite and also by using correlation inequalities valid for spin glasses @xcite .",
    "related bounds on the conditional input - output entropy have also been derived @xcite , @xcite by using `` interpolation methods '' first developed in the mathematical theory of spin glasses @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "as it turns out , all these bounds match the replica expressions and are therefore believed to be the best possible . in @xcite the interpolation method has been extended to obtain the converse bounds for a class of poissonian ldpc codes over the bec , thus recovering combinatorial results of @xcite in a completely different way . concerning the problem of exchanging the @xmath7 limits we refer to @xcite for recent progress that goes beyond the bec .",
    "in this work we will show that a good deal can be learned by looking at the correlations ( more precisely the covariance ) , averaged over the channel outputs , of the map decoder .",
    "we comment below about the methods used , but let us say at the outset that our aim is to cover a fairly general class of binary input memoryless symmetric channels , including the binary symmetric and gaussian ones .",
    "one of our main results is that for sufficiently low noise ( ldpc codes ) the correlations between two code - bits decay exponentially fast as a function of the graph distance between the two code - bits , uniformly in the block length size @xmath0 .",
    "the sparsity of the underlying graph then implies that , if furthermore the decay rate beats the local expansion of the graph , the map gexit curve can be computed by de .",
    "another interpretation of this result is that the solutions provided by the replica / cavity methods of spin glass theory are exact .",
    "low - density generator - matrix codes ( ldgm ) codes have a very clear relationship to spin glass models on random graphs and it is useful to study them before we can attack the harder case of ldpc codes .",
    "besides , the present analysis could potentially be useful in other contexts where they are used ( e.g. rateless codes , source coding ) . for high noise",
    "we prove the decay of correlations and that the map gexit curve can be computed by de .",
    "for that system , we can also show that the decay of correlations implies that the limits @xmath8 can be exchanged for the bp decoder , at least on the binary symmetric channel .",
    "the study of the behavior of correlations as a function of the distance between local degrees of freedom is one of the central aims of statistical physics . for lattice spin systems ( e.g. the ising model ) an important criterion that ensures correlation decay is dobrushin s criterion @xcite - which is of probabilistic nature - and its various improvements .",
    "the main other method - which is not necessarily of probabilistic nature - is based on suitable expansions in powers of `` the strength of interactions '' .",
    "there exists a host of such expansions collectively called `` cluster expansions '' , and the context of spin systems the first and simplest such expansion is the so - called `` polymer expansion '' @xcite .",
    "the main rule of thumb is that all these methods work if the degrees of freedom are weakly interacting , or if one can transform the original system into an effective one involving new weakly interacting degrees of freedom .",
    "it turns out that sophisticated forms of the cluster expansions can be carried out , for ldgm codes in a high noise regime , and for ldpc codes in a low noise regime , for a fairly general class of channels including the binary symmetric channel ( bsc ) as well as the binary input additive white gaussian noise channel ( biawgnc ) .",
    "as we will explain later it is necessary to use quite sophisticated cluster expansions for at least two reasons .",
    "concerning ldgm codes dobrushin s criterion and the polymer expansion require bounded channel outputs ( and thus do not covers the case of the biawgnc ) .",
    "concerning ldpc codes one has to transform the system to a dual one that involves `` negative gibbs weights '' and can not even be treated by probabilistic methods .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section-2 ]",
    "we formulate the models and give a unified view of the main results both for ldgm and ldpc codes .",
    "the main strategy of the proofs is also explained there .",
    "sections [ section-3 ] and [ section-4 ] contain the proofs of correlation decay and its consequences for the gexit curves .",
    "the problem of exchanging the limits of iteration number and block length size is addressed in section [ section-5 ] .",
    "we conclude by pointing out open problems and further connections to the recent literature .",
    "the appendix reviews in a streamlined form the two cluster expansions that are used in sections [ section-3 ] and [ section-4 ] .",
    "summaries of the present results have been reported for the special case of the biawgnc @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we consider binary - input memoryless output - symmetric channels defined by a transition p.d.f @xmath9 with inputs @xmath10 and outputs belonging to @xmath11 .",
