    "boron nitride nanotubes ( bnnt ) consist of hexagonal graphitic - like sheet of alternating boron and nitrogen atoms rolled into a tube @xcite .",
    "the structure of bnnts is analogous to the more well - known ( monatomic ) carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) , but their physical properties are quite different from those of their carbon counterpart .",
    "the mechanical and wear - resistant properties of both materials are of the same impressive order ( for example , the young s modulus is in the terapascal range @xcite ) , while the electronic properties of bnnts can be more attractive .",
    "cnts are either metals or semiconductors depending on their chirality , while bnnts are always semiconductors @xcite with the gap ( @xmath1 5.5 ev ) practically independent of the nanotube chirality and its diameter @xcite .",
    "as hexagonal boron nitride ( h - bn ) is very resistant to oxidation@xcite , bnnts which inherit these properties , are suitable for shielding and coating at the nanoscale . despite these prospects , bnnts have received very little attention compared to cnts due to various difficulties in their reproducible and efficient synthesis @xcite .",
    "the fact that the bnnt consists of two different atomic species implies that the synthesis of bnnts is more complicated than the synthesis of monatomic cnts , as additional chemical reactions are possible .",
    "cnts are typically synthesized from hydrocarbon precursors @xcite and according to current theoretical understanding of the cnt formation process , individual carbon atoms diffuse in or on a metal nanoparticle , forming graphitic networks that eventually gives rise to the appearance of a cnt ( see e.g. refs . [ ] ) .    assuming that these ideas are relevant to the growth of bnnts , it becomes important to understand the factors that determine whether individual nitrogen and boron atoms diffusing on a catalytic surface result in the formation of bn structures , or n@xmath0  molecules and b clusters .    in this paper , in an attempt to understand why catalytic methods for the growth of bnnts work much worse than for their carbon counterparts , we use first - principles calculations to study the behavior of n@xmath0 , b@xmath0  and bn molecules on an iron catalyst .",
    "such molecules are the simplest systems involved , and the complete understanding of their behavior on the catalyst surface is a prerequisite to understanding the whole process .",
    "we assume an ideal situation , where the precursors used for producing bnnts ( and similar structures ) , are decomposed into individual boron and nitrogen atoms and deposited on the catalyst .",
    "we chose iron as the typical catalyst used in chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) growth .",
    "we then investigate under which situations the bn formation becomes energetically favorable .",
    "we show that on a ( 110 ) close - packed surface of bcc iron , b@xmath0  formation will dominate while at step edge regions , bn formation will be the most favorable reaction .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec.([sec : bntsyn ] ) we first give a brief review of the synthesis methods of bnnts and similar structures .",
    "in sec.([sec : setup ] ) we explain the approximations and the computational approach we have chosen and how they can be justified . in sec.([sec : methods ] ) we discuss in detail the computational methods . in sec.([sec :",
    "results ] ) , we present our results and demonstrate how specific catalyst morphologies stabilize the bn bond . to better understand the underlying chemistry , in sec.([sec : ele ] ) we analyze the electronic structure of the adsorbed molecules . finally in ( sec.([sec : conclusions ] ) ) , we discuss how bn catalytic synthesis on iron might be spoiled and how the situation could be improved .",
    "bnnts have been synthesized with various methods and in a wide range of temperatures .",
    "nearly all the methods show traces of metal particles , but their role as a catalyst is far from clear . in this section",
    ", we give a brief overview of bnnt synthesis , with the emphasis on the role of catalysts if present in the synthesis method .",
    "bnnts were synthesized for the first time with the arc - discharge method , using bn - packed tungsten anode and copper cathode @xcite .",
    "successively various anode and cathode materials , including hafnium diboride@xcite , tantalum press - filled with boron nitride @xcite and a mixture of boron , nickel and cobalt @xcite have been used .",
    "typically , amorphous particles have been observed at the bnnt tips @xcite or encapsulated in bn cages @xcite .",
    "these particles could be metallic ( borides ) , implying a metal catalyzed synthesis @xcite , while the encapsulated material could also be bn and the synthesis would be non - catalytic @xcite . a non - catalytic open - ended growth ( involving no nanoparticles ) has also been proposed @xcite .    keeping in mind that temperatures in the arc - discharge method reach beyond 3000 c@xmath2 , it is probably not well - suited for mass production of bnnts .",
    "the laser ablation method is based on the vapour - liquid - solid ( vls ) model @xcite , in which the target material is evaporated and precipitated from the vapor - phase , eventually forming nanoparticles and solid , wire - like nanostructures .",
    "these are then carried by a gas flow to a collector @xcite .",
    "yu , zhou , _",
    "et al._@xcite used bn powder as the target ( t @xmath1  1200 c@xmath2 ) and observed that adding small amounts of catalyst ni and co into the target , resulted in longer nanotubes of better quality that were more often single - walled@xcite .",
    "metal particles were observed to encapsulate inside bn material and they were thought to play an important role in the synthesis @xcite .",
    "in other studies featuring higher temperatures@xcite ( 2400c@xmath2 - 3000c@xmath2 ) , pure bn targets were used and bnnt growth from pure boron nanoparticles was observed@xcite .    in other laser - based techniques used for synthesizing bnnts , the resulting product is typically collected directly from the target itself : laude et al .",
    "@xcite achieved bn dissociation by laser heating in low pressure nitrogen atmosphere .",
    "this resulted in bnnts and bn polyhedra that grew out of liquid boron @xcite .",
    "golberg et .",
    "@xcite heated cubic bn by laser @xcite in diamond anvil cell at high temperature and pressure , producing bnnts directly from the liquid phase @xcite .",
    "ablation of bn by high - frequency laser in low - pressure nitrogen atmosphere @xcite , produced bnnts and bn `` nanohorns '' .",
    "annealing methods have been used to produce bn nanowires , `` nanobamboos '' and bnnts .",
    "these methods produce tubular bn structures by first milling the boron containing starting material into a fine powder during long times ( typically @xmath1 24h ) and then annealing it at temperatures of @xmath1 1000 - 1200c@xmath2  in an inert @xcite or nitrogen containing @xcite atmosphere . as the starting material , h - bn @xcite or pure boron powder @xcite have been used . during the milling , the starting material can be activated @xcite , by performing the milling in reactive atmospheres .",
    "pressurized n@xmath0@xcite or ammonia gases@xcite have been used for this purpose .",
    "nanosized metal particles observed frequently in the samples come from the metal balls used in the milling process .",
    "there seems to be no generally accepted scheme how nanotubules form in this synthesis method .",
    "metallic nanoparticles were observed frequently in the samples , and it was argued that they facilitate the growth of nanotubules @xcite , while it was concluded in other works that they are not important @xcite .",
    "some authors simply state that their role is not clear@xcite . in general , the nanotubes synthesized by these methods are of poor quality and the yields are very small , so the methods are not , at least at the present stage , very suitable for mass - production of bnnts .    related to these methods",
    "is the work of koi , oku and co - workers @xcite in which either hematite@xcite or fe@xmath3n powder@xcite together with boron powder was annealed in nitrogen atmosphere at @xmath1 1000 c@xmath2 .",
    "iron particles coated in bn layers@xcite , bn nanowires@xcite , hollow cages @xcite , `` nanobamboo '' structures @xcite , nanotubes and `` cup - stacked '' nanotubes @xcite were synthesized . in these works ,",
    "the formation of bn layers in the reactions involving fe@xmath3n has been described in two different ways : either fe@xmath3n and fe@xmath0b become liquid , boron segregates on the nanoparticle surface and reacts with the n@xmath0 atmosphere@xcite , or an amorphous boron layer on the fe@xmath3n is converted to bn as the fe@xmath3n is reduced from nitrogen@xcite .      in a chemical vapour deposition ( cvd )",
    "method , one or more volatile precursors react and decompose on the catalyst to form the desired compound .",
    "cvd methods for producing bn filaments and bnnts have been utilized in several works @xcite .",
    "gleize _ et al._@xcite used diborane and ammonia or n@xmath0 gases as the boron and nitrogen containing precursors . these were deposited on various boride surfaces ( including zr , hf , ti , v , nb and ta borides ) at a temperature of 1100c@xmath2 .",
    "it was observed that diborane did not play any role in the tubule growth ( diborane and ammonia formed amorphous bn only ) , but the boron in the reaction came from the boride catalyst itself @xcite .",
    "the boride then acted both as a catalyst and as a reactant for the tubules .",
    "successive studies using similar temperatures have made the same observation .",
    "lourie _ et al._@xcite deposited borazine on cobalt , nickel , and nickel boride catalyst particles and concluded that the boride catalyst gave the best results .",
    "huo , fu , _",
    "et al._@xcite used for the nitrogen containing precursor a mixture of ammonia and nitrogen gas .",
    "the boron source was again the catalyst itself which consisted of iron boride nanoparticles .",
    "in another study @xcite nickel boride nanoparticles supported on alumina ( in order to avoid nanoparticle agglomeration ) with ammonia and nitrogen were used .",
    "bnnts were observed to grow out of the nickel boride nanoparticles at t=1100 - 1300 c@xmath2 , while no `` nanobamboo '' structures were observed ( anglomeration was avoided ) .",
    "ma _ et al .",
    "_  emphasized that cvd using metal catalysts must be difficult due to the poor wetting property of bn with metals @xcite .",
    "for this reason they used melamine diborate to create a metal - free b - n - o precursor @xcite .",
    "this precursor then reacted with n@xmath0 at 1200 - 1700 c@xmath2 .",
    "tip - growth of multi - walled bnnts from amorphous b - n - o clusters was observed@xcite .",
    "the synthesis was explained by condensation of bn from the vapor - phase into the b - n - o particles @xcite , or either by reduction of b@xmath0o@xmath4 vapor @xcite .",
    "borazine and similar molecules have been used in cvd to produce bn nanotubules .",
    "shelimov and moskovits @xcite created bn nanotubules by depositing 2,4,6-trichloroborazine on aluminum oxide at a temperature of 750 c@xmath2 .",
    "these kinds of methods are based on the thermal decomposition ( pyrolysis ) of borazine and similar molecules on surfaces @xcite and there is a direct connection to the cvd synthesis of h - bn thin films , a theme that has been reviewed by paine and narula@xcite .",
    "other methods include the substitution of carbon atoms in cnts by boron and nitrogen @xcite , reduction - nitridation reactions @xcite and boric - acid reacting with activated carbon @xcite .",
    "finally , the most succesful method up to date for synthesizing bnnts is by tang and co - workers @xcite .    in the method of tang",
    "@xcite , boric oxide vapour was created in situ and reacted with ammonia at temperatures t @xmath5 1100 c@xmath2 .",
    "boric oxide was created from magnesium oxide and boron powder .",
    "magnesium was also thought to act as a catalyst in the reduction of boric oxide into boron nitride @xcite .",
    "this method seems to be related to the `` classical high - temperature '' methods to produce bulk h - bn @xcite , where the formation of h - bn is attributed to the gas forming property of the undesired elements ( oxygen ) and the thermodynamical stability of h - bn @xcite .    by this method ,",
    "boron and nitrogen could be converted into bnnts by an efficiency of 40@xmath6 @xcite and hundreds of milligrams of bnnts were produced .",
    "most of the nanotubes were open - ended , although some encapsulated material was found in the samples @xcite .",
    "liquid - phase magnesium drops could have catalyzed the reaction , but in this case they were evaporated in the final process @xcite .",
    "the quantity and quality of bnnts depended strongly on the temperature : below 1100 c@xmath2 , quality was better , but yield was small @xcite .",
    "increasing the temperature , increased the yield , but tube diameter started to grow and bn flakes were formed when temperature was beyond 1250 c@xmath2@xcite .",
    "adding feo to the initial mgo powder , solved this problem and bnnts could be produced up to 1700 c@xmath2@xcite .",
    "the growth then seemed to be catalytic @xcite .",
    "as evident from this brief review , bnnt nanotubes can be synthesized by various methods , and in nearly all of them , metal particles which may have catalytic activity , are present .",
    "however , the role of metal catalysts in bnnt growth is not well understood . in the cvd methods and",
    "when metal catalysts are involved , it seems to be important to use borides instead of pure metals .",
    "borides are able to dissolve boron and nitrogen at the same time @xcite , while the solubility of boron for example in iron , is known to be very small @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "borides likely provide boron atoms during the bnnt growth@xcite , so they act both as the catalyst and the reactant itself , which is conceptually very different from the case of cnt synthesis .    in methods using borazine and similar molecules",
    ", we must keep in mind that these molecules already contain the desired boron nitride bonds .",
    "we can then imagine that the pyrolysis of these molecules in temperatures of t@xmath1800c@xmath2  is used rather to remove the hydrogen atoms , than breaking the boron nitride bonds .",
    "this synthesis can then be conceptually quite different from the other synthesis methods .",
    "finally , in the state of the art method ( tang , golberg , zhi and others ) , the catalytic role of iron and magnesium used in the process is not fully understood .",
    "all these synthesis methods pose interesting challenges for theoretical calculations . however , to our knowledge only a single _ ab initio _  study on bnnt synthesis has been published @xcite . in that study ,",
    "the non - catalytic growth of bnnts was considered and it was shown that open - ended growth of single - walled armchair bnnts is in principle possible @xcite .    modelling",
    "a catalytic process is a very challenging problem .",
    "many of the _ ab initio _  studies in this field concentrate in studying situations where the catalyst is reactive enough to dissociate a precursor , while not being too reactive to block the synthesis@xcite .",
    "a typical example of a thoroughly studied catalytic synthesis process is the ammonia synthesis and its rate limiting step , the n@xmath0  dissociation @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we study the adsorption energies , reaction energies and some reaction barriers for simple boron and nitrogen containing molecules on a catalyst .",
    "we are trying to find reasons why bnnt synthesis on transition metals has proven to be so difficult and if the boron nitride formation could be made energetically favorable .",
    "we do this by studying the stability of the boron nitride bond on iron .",
    "this can be seen as a natural first step before addressing more complicated issues and catalysts ( such as borides ) .",
    "our computational set up mimicks the cvd synthesis .",
    "we assume that the precursors ( not defining them ) have dissociated and donated b and n atoms on the catalyst . in the simulations , we then adsorb individual b and n atoms on the surface and calculate the reaction energetics when these adsorbed atoms ( x@xmath7 and y@xmath7 ) form adsorbed molecular species ( xy@xmath7 ) .",
    "thinking in terms of this simplified model of cvd synthesis it is easy to understand why boron nitride structures can be much more difficult to form than pure carbon structures ; in the carbon case and looking at the most simple molecules , we have only carbon atoms involved in the reactions i.e. xy@xmath7= c@xmath0@xmath7 , while in the boron nitride case we have several competing diatomic molecules , i.e. xy@xmath7= n@xmath0@xmath7 ,  b@xmath0@xmath7 ,  or bn@xmath7 .",
    "as the adsorbed boron and nitrogen atoms react on the catalyst surface , complicated surface species might form , for example , boron clusters , boron - iron clusters , bn molecules and chains and clusters consisting of both boron and nitrogen , etc . if our goal is to understand the problems in bnnt synthesis in such a complex situation , a good first step is to study the most simple surface species , i.e. the adsorbed diatomic molecules that can be formed with adsorbed b and n. if , by studying these simple diatomic molecules , we find situations where the catalyst `` promotes '' the formation of bn@xmath7  molecule instead of n@xmath0@xmath7  and b@xmath0@xmath7  molecules , this should have consequences in more realistic situations as well .",
    "finally , we emphasize that in this work we are interested in the theoretical aspect of the boron nitride bond stabilization .",
    "modelling realistic reaction conditions is out of the scope of the present work .",
    "this would typically call for the calculation of several adsorption and coadsorption configurations , coverages and reaction paths@xcite .",
    "we also concentrate in the small molecular species b@xmath8n@xmath9 , where x , y=\\{0,1}. considering bigger molecules at the dft level becomes computationally very difficult as the number of the possible molecules increases as 2@xmath10 ( n = x+y ) .",
    "in _ ab initio _  calculations , realistic catalyst nanoparticles are frequently modelled by slabs in supercell geometry , consisting of 3 - 6 atomic layers of catalyst and a sufficient amount of vacuum ( @xmath1110 ) between the slabs .",
    "the slab usually contains a step edge in order to model a realistic nanoparticle with active sites @xcite . in the following , we assume that two adsorbates , x@xmath7 and y@xmath7 , are far away from each other on the surface and we bring them together to form a new adsorbate species xy@xmath7 . the energy for this reaction x@xmath7+y@xmath7@xmath12xy@xmath7 can be calculated as follows : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the energy of the adsorbed surface species x@xmath7 and e@xmath15 is the energy of a surface unit cell without adsorbates .",
    "we manipulate eq.([surfreact ] ) as follows : @xmath16 in the last line of the equation , we have used energy values @xmath17 defined as : @xmath18 we observe from eq.([stage1 ] ) , that using `` shifted '' energy values @xmath17 defined in eq.([surfe ] ) , we can calculate the reaction energy for a reaction x@xmath7+y@xmath7@xmath12xy@xmath7 on the surface with the simple formula @xmath19 in the results section , we tabulate values of e@xmath20 in different parts of the catalyst surface ( terrace , edge ) and then use these tabulated values to calculate reaction energetics using eq.([surfreact2 ] ) .    using the same notation ,",
    "the adsorption energy can be written as follows : @xmath21 and the dissociative adsorption energy , i.e. energy for reaction xy(g)@xmath12x@xmath7+y@xmath7 as : @xmath22 where e(x ) is the energy of the molecular species in the gas phase .",
    "the calculations were performed with programs in the framework of the density functional theory ( dft ) , as implemented in two different codes , siesta and vasp .",
    "the siesta code @xcite uses pseudo - atomic orbitals as its basis set , while vasp @xcite is based on plane waves .",
    "siesta relies on the pseudopotential method to describe the core electrons , while projected augmented waves ( paws)@xcite can be used in vasp .",
    "all calculations were done with periodic boundary conditions , collinear spin and using the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) general gradient approximation ( gga)@xcite .",
    "we use the monkhorst - pack ( mp ) sampling@xcite of the brillouin zone in calculations involving the slab . as we are using different k - point samplings",
    ", we will indicate the fineness of the m@xmath23n brillouin zone sampling also with the area of the reciprocal space per one sampled k - point ( a@xmath24 ) . in this work ,",
    "preliminary calculations were typically done with siesta , while the final energies were always calculated with vasp . due to the more systematic control of accuracy in the vasp code ,",
    "we use it as a benchmark for the more computationally efficient siesta code .",
    "nudged elastic band ( neb ) calculations@xcite for reaction barriers were performed entirely with vasp .      in siesta calculations , troullier - martins",
    "@xcite scalar - relativistic pseudopotentials , with non - linear core - corrections were used .",
    "the density of the real space grid was defined by a corresponding plane wave cutoff of @xmath1 350 ry and the effective density of the grid was further increased using a grid cell sampling of 12 points . the basis set used by siesta consists of numerical pseudo - atomic orbitals @xcite .",
    "these orbitals are obtained from the same atomic calculation that is used to generate the pseudopotentials ( thus the name `` pseudo - atomic '' ) .",
    "the cutoff radii and the amount of confinement of these orbitals can be defined either by the cutoff radii ( r@xmath25 ) or by the `` energyshift '' parameter ( e@xmath26 ) , larger energyshift corresponding to increasingly confined orbitals and smaller cutoff radii @xcite . in siesta ,",
    "a typical basis set is the double-@xmath27 polarized ( dzp ) , that consists of doubled atomic orbitals and an extra set of polarization orbitals created using perturbation theory .",
    "a typical value for the e@xmath26 parameter in solids is @xmath1 200 mev .    for the molecular species in this study",
    ", we used the dzp basis set and e@xmath26=150 mev . in the case of boron",
    "this leads to a basis set with doubled 2s and 2p - orbitals , plus an additional set of 3d - orbitals .",
    "the total amount of orbitals is then 13 for one boron atom . the cutoff radii defined using the energyshift for boron are 2.7   ( 2s ) , 3.3   ( 2p ) and 3.3   ( 3d ) . for nitrogen",
    "the cutoff radii from the energyshift are 2.0   ( 2s ) , 2.5   ( 2p ) and 2.5 ",
    "( 3d ) .",
    "siesta has earlier been used to simulate iron nanoparticles @xcite using both the szsp and dzsp basis sets .",
    "the szsp consist of 3d , 4s and 4p orbitals while in dzsp 3d and 4s orbitals are doubled . in refs.@xcite an explicit confinement radius of r@xmath25=2.3    for both szsp and dzsp basis sets",
    "was used and it was demonstrated that these basis sets with r@xmath25=2.3    produced very well the properties of iron , including the magnetism @xcite .",
    "however , in the present case and while studying chemisorption of molecules on iron surface , we prefer longer cutoff radii and thus use a szsp basis with e@xmath26=150 mev to define the cutoff radii of the orbitals .",
    "this way , the cutoff radii for the iron orbitals are 2.41   ( 3d ) , 3.9   ( 4s ) and 3.9  ( 4p ) . in our basis set , all atoms have then basis orbitals that extend at least up to 2.5   and some of them up to 3.9  .",

    "the parameter adjusting the convergence of the self - consistency cycle is increased to 10@xmath28 .",

    ", we observed that neb calculations with large surface slabs can be tedious ; some configurations at the lowest energy path could bring down their total energies by shifting the iron layers in a collective movement and this way change the relative position of the adsorbant molecule to energetically more favorable site . to avoid this unphysical situation , we fixed the lowermost layers and relaxed only the topmost iron layer and the adsorbed molecule during the neb calculations .",

    "this is particularly true for geometry n-2 as it can easily have a 4-fold coordination with iron due to the step edge morphology .",

    "the bond order of n@xmath0  is 3 , and there is no net spin magnetic moment .",
    "when n@xmath0  is put in contact with an adsorbant , the bonding is likely dominated by the @xmath34 and @xmath35 states . from the electronegativity of nitrogen and iron , we could argue that n@xmath0  is likely to receive electrons and thus bond through the antibonding state @xmath35 ( lumo ) . to be more precise ,",

    "the stabilization of bn at the step edge can be explained in terms of atomic coordination : we observed that , within the computational unit cell we used , nitrogen preferred 3 - 4 , while boron 5 - 6 fold coordination with iron and the only morphology where these two coordinations are simultaneously available , is found at the step edge .    summarizing , according to our calculations , the bn bond is stabilized in step edge regions of the iron catalyst .",
    "this implies that the yield of bnnt in a cvd synthesis might be enhanced by altering the iron catalyst morphology to include more steps , instead of close - packed surface regions .",
    "simply having step edges is not enough ; having step edges , but long terraces , will result in more flat surface sites than step edge sites , lowering the free energy for flat surface sites . from the point of view of maximizing the bnnt yield , the terraces",
    "should then be very short . as creating a catalyst nanoparticle with a desired morphology",
    "is very difficult , the predictions on bn yield given in this theoretical work could be put to test in practice by using as a catalyst a high - index fe surface with very short steps .",
    "we wish to thank the center for scientific computing helsinki , for use of its computational resources .",

    "<S> in an attempt to understand why catalytic methods for the growth of boron nitride nanotubes work much worse than for their carbon counterparts , we use first - principles calculations to study the energetics of elemental reactions forming n@xmath0 , b@xmath0  and bn molecules on an iron catalyst . </S>",

    "<S> we also observe that the local morphology of a step edge present in our nanoparticle model stabilizes the boron nitride molecule with respect to b@xmath0  due to the ability of the step edge to offer sites with different coordination simultaneously for nitrogen and boron . </S>",
