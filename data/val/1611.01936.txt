    "graph isomorphism problem , or exact graph matching , which has numerous applications , is the problem of determining whether two given graphs are isomorphic .",
    "that is , there is a bijection between vertices of two graphs which preserves adjacency and non - adjacency of vertices . in order to solve this problem",
    ", one could consider each of the @xmath3 bijections between vertices of two graphs , and check whether it is an isomorphism between the two graphs .",
    "if they are not isomorphic , one would need to check all @xmath3 bijections to realize this fact .",
    "but , even for relatively small values of @xmath0 , the number @xmath3 is unmanageably large .",
    "hence , finding an effective method with tolerable computational complexity to distinguish the isomorphism or non - isomorphism of two graphs is very valuable .",
    "whilst polynomial - time isomorphism - testing algorithms have been found for special classes of graphs , such as trees@xcite , planner graphs@xcite , graphs of bounded degree@xcite and ordered graphs@xcite , but no polynomial runtime algorithm is known for this problem .",
    "that is , in the worst case the computational complexity of any available algorithm is exponential in the number of graph vertices @xcite .",
    "one approach to solve this problem is using graph spectrum , i.e. the eigenvalues of matrix representation of a graph , as a graph invariant . since",
    ", the matrix representation of a simple graph is symmetric , graph spectrum is computable in time @xmath1 .",
    "thus , a graph spectrum can be regarded as a fast graph invariant to distinguish graph isomorphism classes , provided that it has been chosen properly . from this point of view ,",
    "a good matrix representation for graphs is a matrix that produces minimum possible number of cospectral graphs .",
    "this idea widely has been used and investigated in several papers , such as spectral determination @xcite , spectral characterization @xcite , spectrum as a graph invariant @xcite , comparing graphs via graph spectrum @xcite , graph clustering @xcite .    until now",
    ", several alternative matrix representations for graphs have been proposed in the literatures , such as adjacency matrix , laplacian matrix , signless laplacian @xcite , normalized laplacian @xcite and heat kernel @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of all these representations may be used to characterize graphs .",
    "wilson and zue@xcite have compared these spectrums according to cospectrality . they have shown that there are some graphs which even the combination of these spectrums is not able to separate them .",
    "in other words , even the combination of these spectra is not sufficient to determine the graph isomorphism classes , uniquely . to avoid cospectral graphs , emms et al.@xcite",
    "have introduced a matrix representation inspired by the notion of coined quantum walk .",
    "they have shown the graph spectrum with respect to this matrix is successful to separate many known families of cospectral graphs .",
    "but , there are some non - isomorphic graphs , like a 14-vertex graphs pair , which are not distinguishable by their spectrum . in addition",
    ", the size of the matrix that they have proposed is in the order of @xmath4 .    here",
    ", we proposes a new matrix representation for graphs .",
    "the eigenvalues of this matrix , as a graph invariant , provides a simple polynomial - time algorithm to efficiently solve the graph isomorphism problem in practice .",
    "continuous spectrum and split technique which are defined in this paper , mutually , provide a fast computable graph invariant to solve some computationally hard problems , such as graph isomorphism and graph automorphism , in practice .",
    "the continuity matrix representation for graphs is defined in the next section .",
    "the eigenvalues of this matrix which is in terms of a variable is called continuous spectrum .",
    "this spectrum is equipped with split method in the third section to make it more efficient in separating non - isomorphic graphs .",
    "the paper is concluded in the fourth section .",
    "some derived relations and theorems about continuous spectrum are given in the appendix .",
    "in this section , we define continuity matrix representation of graphs . also , we describe why we expect the eigenvalues of such matrix to behave well in separating non - isomorphic graphs .",
    "+ at first , let us review some used definitions and notations .",
    "the adjacency matrix of a graph @xmath5 is a matrix @xmath6 $ ] where @xmath7 if @xmath8 is adjacent to @xmath9 and @xmath10 otherwise .",
    "the laplacian matrix of a graph is @xmath11 .",
    "matrix @xmath12 is diagonal degree matrix , whose diagonal elements are given by the vertex degrees @xmath13 .",
    "the sign - less laplacian and the normalized laplacian matrix , respectively , are @xmath14 and @xmath15 . + for a given spectrum , two graphs are cospectral if they share the same spectrum .",
    "a graph @xmath5 is said to be determined by its spectrum , or ds@xcite , if any graph @xmath16 that is cospectral with @xmath5 is also isomorphic to @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath17 be the adjacency matrix of an @xmath0-vertex graph @xmath5 and @xmath18 be a fixed non - negative integer .",
    "we define continuity matrix @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is a real variable .",
    "@xmath22 is a diagonal matrix with the diagonal entries of matrix @xmath23 .",
    "continuous spectrum of @xmath5 is the eigenvalues of @xmath24 .    clearly , the matrix @xmath24 is the same adjacency matrix , if @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "continuous spectrum is the eigenvalues of matrix @xmath24 and , consequently , is in terms of @xmath27 . to compute the continuous spectrum for a given graph , it is sufficient to assign an arbitrary value to @xmath27 .",
    "computer results show that small value of @xmath18 is enough to separate non - isomorphic graphs by the continuous spectrum .",
    "for instance , taking @xmath28 is enough to discriminate graph isomorphism classes for graphs with up to @xmath29 vertices . as an example , the continuity matrix representation of the graph fig.[graf ] is given ( for @xmath28 ) , here .    a sample graph and its continuity matrix , width=151 ]    @xmath30\\ ] ]    continuous spectrum digram in terms of @xmath27 , width=453 ]    figure [ diagram ] depicts the continuous spectrum of the mentioned graph in terms of @xmath27 .",
    "since this graph is bipartite , its diagram is symmetric about the origin .",
    "the proof of this property for bipartite graphs is given in the appendix .",
    "the aim of defining such spectrum is to enhance the ability of graph spectrum in distinguishing non - isomorphic graphs .",
    "we would like a graph spectrum to play the role of a fast computable invariant to discriminate non- isomorphic graphs .",
    "let us see why we expect continuous spectrum to be efficient in discriminating non - isomorphic graphs .",
    "let @xmath17 be the adjacency matrix of a graph @xmath5 and @xmath31 is an eigenvalue of @xmath17 with the corresponding eigenvector @xmath32 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath33 . in other words , @xmath34 the above system of equations says that the summation of the values of neighbors of a vertex should be the value of that vertex multiplied by @xmath35 . in this view",
    ", @xmath36 is a possible value under this condition that summation of neighbors values of each vertex should be the value of that vertex multiplied by @xmath31 .",
    "thus , only the neighbor vertices are regarded and other vertices are ignored in each equation .",
    "+ a natural question arises here .",
    "why only the direct neighbors are considered and other vertices which are two or more steps away are ignored ? how can we consider the effect of vertices which are not neighbors of vertex @xmath8 in the @xmath37-th equation of the above system of equations while preserving the importance of the neighbors ?",
    "+ therefore , we want to modify adjacency matrix to take into account the effect of non - neighbor vertices while preserving the importance of the neighbors .",
    "we use an attenuator factor , namely @xmath27 , to reduce the effect of far vertices .",
    "hence , in each equation we enter the effect of vertices which are @xmath38 steps away , by adding their corresponding entries multiplied by @xmath39 . also , if there are more than one way between @xmath8 and @xmath9 , we enumerate all of them .",
    "exactly speaking , we consider @xmath18-length walks and their numbers .",
    "we know that @xmath40-entry of @xmath41 indicates the number of @xmath18-length walks between @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "thus , we take into account the effect of vertex @xmath9 which is @xmath18 edges away from @xmath44 by @xmath40-entry of @xmath41 multiplied by @xmath45",
    ". then , we put zero on the diagonal .",
    "therefore , the desired matrix is what you see in the above definition .",
    "graphs which are determined by their spectrum , abbreviated by ds@xcite , are those that do not have any cospectral mate . in order to compare the successfulness of one spectrum in characterizing a set of graphs , we count the number of graphs which are determined by that spectrum .",
    "the distinguishing ability of adjacency spectrum , laplacian , signless laplacian and normalized laplacian spectrum are compared with continuous spectrum in table [ small ] .",
    "[ smallgraphs ]    .",
    "[ small ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have measured the distinguishing ability of split spectrum with respect to different graph spectra by the fraction of ds graphs that they produce in table [ srg ] . we know that the eigenvalues of all known graph representing matrices , such as adjacency matrix , laplacian matrix and even continuity matrix is the same for strongly regular graphs with the same parameters .",
    "but , as computer results show split continuous spectrum is able to easily distinguishes the isomorphism classes of such graphs . + in table",
    "[ srg ] , the results of using split spectrum for discriminating graph isomorphism classes of srgs are shown .",
    "this table shows that the split spectrum with respect to adjacency matrix is not able to successfully separate non - isomorphic classes of srg graphs .",
    "in contrast , the combination of continuous spectrum with split technique provides an efficient tool to distinguish graph isomorphism classes . as we see in the table , taking @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 is enough to discriminate all mentioned instances of strongly regular graphs with @xmath49 to @xmath50 vertices .    since the computational complexity of this method is @xmath2 for @xmath0-vertex graphs , it significantly outperforms to other methods which are exponential .",
    "thus , it is a valuable approach to solve graph isomorphism problem in practice , even for strongly regular graphs .",
    "the eigenvalue of a matrix representation of graphs , i.e. graph spectrum , is invariant to arrangement of graph vertices and is computable in @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , it is a good invariant to separate non - isomorphic graphs .",
    "but , usual spectrums such as adjacency spectrum , laplacian spectrum and even combination of them suffer from existing cospectral graphs .",
    "for example , for all strongly regular graphs with the same parameter , both adjacency and laplacian matrix produce the same eigenvalues .    in this paper , a new matrix representation for graphs , i.e. continuity matrix , is proposed .",
    "this representation has improved the ability of graph spectrum in recognizing non - isomorphic graphs .",
    "the definition of continuity matrix is based on the extension of the equations that eigenvalues satisfy in . in a graph adjacency matrix , each equation is established for a vertex and its neighbors , while in the new defined matrix each equation is written for all vertices .",
    "this fact makes the graph spectrum more engaged in graph structure and , consequently , enhances its ability in discrimination of non - isomorphic graphs .",
    "therefore , finding cospectral graphs with respect to this new matrix is difficult .    for discrimination of some special graphs such as strongly regular graphs , which have been known as hard cases of the isomorphism problem , continuous spectrum is not sufficient , alone .",
    "thus , split spectrum was proposed to improve continuous spectrum in separating non - isomorphic graphs .",
    "we have shown by computations that split continuous spectrum , which is computable in @xmath2 , successfully characterizes the isomorphism classes of many known families of strongly regular graphs up to 64 vertices .",
    "continuous spectrum and split method , mutually , provide an efficient invariant to discriminate non - isomorphic graphs .",
    "such graph spectrum which is highly entangled with graph structure benefits us in solving some computationally hard problems , such as graph isomorphism and graph automorphism problem , in practice .",
    "split continuous spectrum , which does not need any heuristic attempt , provides a simple , efficient and fast graph invariant to distinguish graph isomorphism classes in average time @xmath51 and @xmath2 in worst case .",
