    "in the recent years , a framework for multivariate wavelets was developed  @xcite , generalizing the one - dimensional periodic wavelets , which were developed in  @xcite , to the multivariate case . by introducing the possibility to use any integer matrix for the underlying patterns , this framework possesses anisotropic approximation properties  @xcite .",
    "the directional approach was also discussed in the case of wavelets on the @xmath0 recently , e.g. for the shearlets  @xcite in order to detect singularities  @xcite .",
    "for the one - dimensional case the de la valle poussin means and their corresponding periodic wavelets create a multiresolution analysis ( mra ) with a fast decomposition algorithm and provide good localization  @xcite .",
    "these de la valle poussin wavelets were used in @xcite in order to detect singularities of a function . in  @xcite an mra",
    "was constructed using dirichlet kernels and a certain set of dilation matrices . in  @xcite fast algorithms for both the fourier and wavelet transform",
    "were presented for any set of dilation matrices and corresponding scaling functions forming an mra .",
    "our main goal is the construction of multivariate trigonometric functions defined through their fourier coefficients by sampling a function @xmath1 of certain smoothness .",
    "this function @xmath1 can be of compact support and the sampling points vary for each space of the nested sequence of spaces that form the mra .",
    "we investigate , how to also obtain the coefficients of the two - scale relation from this construction . for a special case",
    ", @xmath1 resembles not only the de la valle poussin means of the one - dimensional case , but also the mentioned dirichlet kernels . choosing a smooth function @xmath2 follows the idea of obtaining well localized scaling functions which also lead to well localized periodic wavelets .",
    "this construction further introduces the possibility to use arbitrary dilation matrices , especially shearing matrices such as @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the presented approach does not only enable a construction for an arbitrary set of scaling functions , for the dyadic case we also obtain a similar construction for the corresponding wavelets .",
    "their analogues to the two - scale relation , i.e. the coefficients that characterize the wavelet in the scaling space they are nested in , is derived . both , the two - scale relation and these coefficients can be computed just using @xmath1 and the dilation matrix @xmath5 involved .",
    "we investigate for which functions @xmath1 we can derive a construction of a set of nested dyadic spaces where each scaling function @xmath6 together with its translates forms a basis for the corresponding space and depends on the next scaling function @xmath7 at most .",
    "on the one hand , the construction enables an explicit description of a complete mra using the function @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "it increases the flexibility of an adaptive mra , where the sequence of dilation matrices @xmath8 and hence their scaling functions @xmath6 and wavelets @xmath9 can be chosen adaptively .",
    "the scaling spaces obtained in this setting can also be used to construct and characterize anisotropic interpolation operators .",
    "corresponding error estimates and function spaces are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : mra ] we first introduce basic preliminaries in order to define the multiresolution analysis for an arbitrary sequence of dilation matrices @xmath10 .",

    "we obtain @xmath15 scaling functions .",
    "the spaces of their translates are characterized in theorem  [ thm : dlvp ] , especially the spaces are nested and the fourier coefficients of these scaling functions are sample values of a function that possesses the same smoothness properties as @xmath1 . for the dyadic case ,",
    "i.e. both the scaling space corresponding to @xmath16 and its orthogonal complement with respect to the next space @xmath17 are again a spaces of translates of just one function each , we obtain a wavelet of de la valle poussin type , which is investigated in theorem  [ thm : dlvpw ] .",
    "it inherits the properties from the corresponding scaling functions and is also given through fourier coefficients by sampling a smooth function , too .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : dlvp - mra ] we investigate for which functions @xmath1 the dyadic scaling functions @xmath18 do not depend on the complete vector of matrices @xmath19 , but only on the first matrix @xmath20 .",
    "this generalizes the one - dimensional case , where only the scaling factor @xmath21 was fixed .",
    "starting from the two - dimensional case , we also investigate the @xmath22-dimensional case .",

    "the dashed line marks the boundary of the support of @xmath645 , the dotted lines encircle the plateau of the wavelet . for both , the direction through the center of their plateaus is drawn as @xmath646 . if we sample @xmath647 on the pattern @xmath648 and use the fundamental interpolant of @xmath649 , we obtain an approximation @xmath650 in this space , cf . @xcite .    using the wavelet transform",

    "do posses less artifacts and their amplitude is higher .",
    "while the first decomposition in the mentioned section 6.2 of @xcite was only able to detect both diagonals at the same time with the one level of decomposition , this example also demonstrates the ability to look at the diagonal lines separately .",
    "we see that orthogonal to @xmath651 lie all 12 parallel lines of discontinuities in the third directional derivative .",
    "they are obtained when looking at @xmath652 , see figure  [ subfig : gm1 ] ) .",
    "the only discontinuities of the third directional derivative along @xmath653 are the 24 singular points at the ends of the lines from the previous case .",
    "the corresponding function is shown in figure  [ subfig : gm1 ] ) .",
    "in fact , both wavelets can also be obtained by choosing two different factorizations of the matrix @xmath654 , i.e. the idea of having an @xmath655 pixel image of the box spline @xmath656 .",
    "these factorizations are @xmath657 and @xmath658 .",
    "for the second decomposition in each of these factorizations , theorem [ thm : dlvp : unabhaengig ] can not be applied due to @xmath659 .",
    "though the following factors again yield , that just one dilation matrix @xmath325 is needed to construct the scaling function and wavelet of de la valle poussin type .",
    "in this paper , we examined a characterization of a periodic anisotropic multiresolution analysis @xmath660 in order to introduce and investigate multivariate scaling functions of de la valle poussin type @xmath6 that posses a certain decay in their fourier coefficients .",
    "the decay is given by an admissible function @xmath1 which can be chosen quite generally .",
    "especially for the one - dimensional case , certain functions @xmath1 resemble the dirichlet and fjer kernel and all de la valle poussin means . in the multivariate case ,",
    "the dirichlet kernels are also a special case of the presented construction .    with a set of regular matrices @xmath661 , these scaling functions of de la valle poussin type yield a finite sequence of nested shift - invariant spaces .",
    "for the dyadic case , i.e. where all dilation matrices @xmath325 are of determinant @xmath21 , the framework also yields a similar construction for the wavelets that form the orthogonal complements between the nested spaces by their shifts .",
    "when decomposing a single function @xmath101 into fractions in these wavelet spaces , we obtain directional information about @xmath101 .    in the construction , there are only a few restrictions on the function @xmath2 , the sequence of wavelets @xmath662 , @xmath326 , is based on .",
    "we introduced the notion of admissibility for @xmath2 , i.e. having compact support and being a partition of unity . extending the presented construction",
    ", one could also introduce a sequence @xmath663 of such admissible functions and perform the construction using a different admissible function for each scaling function .",
    "how smoothness properties of the function @xmath2 characterize the localization properties of the sequence of wavelets , is a topic for future research .    while in the general construction ,",
    "the scaling functions of de la valle poussin type @xmath18 , @xmath386 , depend on a complete vector @xmath664 of matrices , theorem [ thm : dlvp : unabhaengig ] and lemma  [ lem : dlvp : unabhaengigd ] examine this vector in more detail . in particular , for a further restriction to @xmath1 , i.e. having a certain compact support , we obtain the identity @xmath665 using the set of matrices from dirichlet case in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6 ) . for the dyadic case",
    "we also obtain the corresponding wavelets @xmath662 , @xmath326 . in this",

    "then , the matrix vector @xmath667 in each definition of a wavelet chain is longer than just @xmath279 , but still finite for any scaling function @xmath6 .",
    "these functions can now be used to examine a broad range of directional decompositions of a given function @xmath101 . on the one hand , for a given matrix @xmath60 on",

    "these decompositions are given by any factorization of @xmath60 into a product of matrices with determinant @xmath21 .",
    "on the other hand , for a given preference of one ore more directions , these functions of de la valle poussin type give rise to many mras that prefer this set of `` directions of interest '' in their wavelet spaces .",
