    "many problems in physics require understanding the stochastic dynamics of spatially extended objects .",
    "traditionally , the equilibrium and nonequilibrium dynamical properties of such systems have been described in terms of space- and time - dependent correlation functions . in recent years",
    ", there has been considerable interest in studies of first - passage properties  @xcite of the dynamical fluctuations of such objects , quantified in terms of _ persistence _ and _ survival _ probabilities . the first - passage problem for a temporally fluctuating quantity involves determining the distribution of times for the quantity to cross a specified reference value _ for the first time_. the persistence probability , defined as the probability of the stochastic variable _ not _ returning to its initial value in a specified time interval , is essentially an integral of the distribution of the corresponding first - passage time . a closely related quantity , the survival probability , measures the probability of not crossing some other reference point , such as the average value of the stochastic process , in a specified time interval .",
    "these probabilities depend on the whole history of the time evolution of the system in the specified time interval , and provide a characterization of the underlying stochastic dynamics that is complementary to , and in some sense more detailed than a description based on correlation functions .",
    "persistence and survival probabilities have been used in recent years to describe the statistics of first - passage events in a variety of spatially extended stochastic systems .",
    "examples of such applications range from the classical diffusion equation  @xcite to the zero - temperature dynamics of ferromagnetic ising and potts models  @xcite , nonequilibrium critical dynamics  @xcite , reaction - diffusion processes in disordered environments  @xcite , and volatility in stock market fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "an increasing number of experimental results are also available for persistence and survival in systems such as coalescence of droplets  @xcite , coarsening of two - dimensional soap froth  @xcite , twisted nematic liquid crystal  @xcite , nuclear spin distribution in laser - polarized atomic gas  @xcite , and slow combustion front in paper  @xcite .",
    "there also has been much recent interest in experimental and theoretical studies of the stochastic dynamics of growth and fluctuation of structures on surfaces  @xcite .",
    "the technique of imaging spatial distributions and temporal variations of structures on surfaces using scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) has made it possible to perform experiments in which theoretical predictions can be tested directly .",
    "equilibrium fluctuations of crystal layer boundaries or _ steps _ on a vicinal surface , obtained by cutting a crystal in a direction close to a high - symmetry plane , have been extensively studied  @xcite in this context .",
    "a vicinal surface consists of an array of monatomic steps separated by terraces of the high - symmetry plane . in thermal equilibrium , which can be achieved in experiments if the temperature is sufficiently high , the one - dimensional ( 1d ) steps roughen due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "the stochastic dynamics of these fluctuations is theoretically modeled by langevin equations  @xcite and atomistic , solid - on - solid models  @xcite .",
    "theoretical and experimental investigations  @xcite of various space- and time - dependent correlation functions of equilibrium step fluctuations have provided a wealth of information about the physical parameters that govern these fluctuations .    in this paper , we review the results of our recent analytic , numerical and experimental investigations  @xcite of various first - passage properties of equilibrium step fluctuations . in these studies , both temporal and spatial persistence and survival probabilities of different kinds",
    "are considered and the results of stm experiments on systems with different microscopic mechanisms of step - edge fluctuations are compared directly with the predictions of analytic and numerical calculations for appropriate models .",
    "the first studies of first - passage statistics of surface growth and fluctuations were carried out by krug and co - workers  @xcite who obtained analytic and numerical results for the persistence probability for several langevin equations for interface dynamics .",
    "our work addresses many other interesting questions about the first - passage statistics of interface fluctuations .",
    "the motivation for these studies arises partly from the possibility of making direct comparisons between experimental observations and theoretical predictions for various first - passage properties of these systems .",
    "such comparisons provide an opportunity to validate the theoretical models commonly used to describe step fluctuations . as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , a description of dynamical interface fluctuations in terms of persistence and survival probabilities is not just an equivalent alternative to the usual description  @xcite based on dynamical scaling : first - passage properties provide a richer characterization of the fully nonlocal and non - markovian ( both in space and time ) nature of interface fluctuations .",
    "this is reflected in the nontrivial behavior of some of the first - passage properties even for fluctuation processes described by linear dynamical equations for which dynamical scaling is rather trivial  @xcite .",
    "our studies are also motivated by the importance of step fluctuations in the practical problem of assessing the stability of nanoscale structures .",
    "this is a fundamental and challenging issue that will become increasingly important as the length scale of devices approaches the atomic limit  @xcite . in this context",
    ", it is important to address questions such as what is the distribution of the time for a nanoscale structure to fluctuate _ for the first time _ to a point of encounter at which a change in properties or some other switching behavior may occur .",
    "studies of first - passage properties of fluctuating steps and similar atomic - scale structures on surfaces are relevant for answering such questions .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . various persistence and survival properties studied by us",
    "are defined in section  [ def ] .",
    "the models used in our analytic and numerical studies are defined in section  [ models ] .",
    "the methods used in our numerical studies are also summarized in this section .",
    "section  [ expt ] contains a brief account of our experimental methods .",
    "the results of our analytic , numerical and experimental studies of first - passage properties of equilibrium fluctuations of isolated steps with different microscopic kinetics are described in detail in section  [ results ] .",
    "section  [ summ ] contains a summary of our main results and a few concluding remarks .",
    "we consider an isolated 1d step whose position at time @xmath0 is described by the function @xmath1 where the @xmath2-axis is taken to be along the average step position . in temporal persistence and survival , we consider the temporal fluctuations of @xmath1 at a fixed position @xmath2 . the temporal persistence probability @xmath3 is defined as the probability that the sign of @xmath4 $ ] _ does not change _ for _ all _ @xmath5 . clearly , this is the probability that the step - edge position does not return to its initial value ( at time @xmath6 ) during its stochastic time evolution over the period from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "averaging @xmath3 over the coordinate @xmath2 and the initial time @xmath6 in the equilibrium state of the step , one obtains the temporal persistence probability @xmath8 considered in our work .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath8 is closely related to the zero - crossing statistics of the stochastic variable @xmath9 $ ] . in particular , if @xmath10 is the distribution of the time interval between two successive zero crossings of this quantity , then @xmath11 .",
    "the probability of _ persistent large deviations _ , introduced by dornic and godreche  @xcite , provides a more detailed characterization of stochastic processes . a closely related idea , that of sign - time distribution , was developed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "this involves the variable @xmath12 $ ] that takes the values @xmath13 .",
    "the average sign variable @xmath14 is defined as @xmath15 .",
    "clearly , the values of @xmath14 lie between @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "then , the probability of persistent large deviations , @xmath18 , is defined as the probability for the average sign @xmath19 to remain above a certain pre - assigned value @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , up to time @xmath0 : @xmath22 . averages over the initial time @xmath6 and the coordinate @xmath2",
    "are implied in the above definition . also , we assume , without any loss of generality , that the initial deviation of the step position is in the `` positive '' direction , i.e. @xmath23 for @xmath24 . then , the initial value of @xmath14 is equal to unity and @xmath25 is identical to the temporal persistence probability @xmath8 defined above . also , @xmath26 is trivially equal to unity for all @xmath0 .",
    "the time - dependence of @xmath18 for @xmath27 is quite nontrivial and its dependence on @xmath20 provides a convenient way of characterizing the underlying stochastic dynamics .    the temporal survival probability @xmath28 is defined as the probability that the sign of @xmath29 $ ] _ does not change _ for _ all _ @xmath5 . here",
    ", @xmath30 is the _ thermodynamic average _ value of the step position which does not depend on the coordinate @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the temporal survival probability @xmath31 , obtained by averaging @xmath28 over @xmath6 and @xmath2 , measures the probability of the step position not crossing its average value during its evolution over time @xmath0 .",
    "this quantity is clearly related to the zero crossing statistics of the deviation of the step position from its average value .",
    "although the definition of @xmath31 is rather similar to that of the persistence probability @xmath8 , the time - dependences of these two quantities turn out to be quite different .",
    "we have also considered a generalization of the survival probability in which the `` return position '' is shifted from the average step position @xmath30 to an arbitrary reference position @xmath32 .",
    "the generalized ( temporal ) survival probability @xmath33 is defined as the probability that the step position @xmath34 is initially beyond the pre - assigned reference position , @xmath35 ( or @xmath36 , for fluctuations that are symmetric about the average value , @xmath37 ) , and remains there over a given time interval @xmath0 . clearly , @xmath38 , but the time - dependence of @xmath33 for other values of @xmath32 depends on the choice of @xmath32 .",
    "another generalization , the generalized inside survival probability @xmath39 , is defined as the probability of the step position remaining between the pre - assigned reference positions @xmath32 and @xmath40 ( assuming the fluctuations to be symmetric about the average value , @xmath37 ) over time @xmath0 .",
    "spatial persistence and survival probabilities are defined in the same way as the temporal quantities mentioned above , but considering the step position @xmath1 to be a function of the coordinate @xmath2 for fixed @xmath0 .",
    "for example , the spatial persistence probability @xmath41 is defined as the probability that the step position at a fixed time @xmath0 does not return to its `` initial '' value @xmath42 as one moves from the point @xmath43 to the point @xmath44 along the average step direction ( averages over @xmath43 and @xmath0 are implied ) .",
    "if the separation between adjacent steps is sufficiently large , the entropic and elastic interactions  @xcite between different steps may be neglected .",
    "we consider here this simple situation where the dynamics of a step is not affected by other steps on the surface .",
    "the energy of an isolated step is then simply proportional to the total length measured along its fluctuating edge . in a continuum description where the step - edge position is denoted by the function @xmath1 , the hamiltonian of an isolated step",
    "is then given by @xmath45 & = & \\tilde{\\beta }   \\int_0^l [ 1+|\\partial h/\\partial x|^2]^{1/2 } dx \\nonumber \\\\ & \\simeq & \\frac{\\tilde{\\beta}}{2 } \\int_0^l |\\partial h/\\partial x|^2 dx   + \\hbox{constant } , \\label{hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the `` step - edge stiffness '' ( energy per unit length ) , @xmath47 is the step size , and we have used a small - gradient expansion . at relatively high temperatures , fluctuations in the step position are known  @xcite to be dominated by random attachment and detachment ( ad ) of atoms at the step edge .",
    "the `` noise '' arising from these microscopic processes is clearly non - conserving : the total number of atoms in the crystal layer that terminates at the step edge does not remain constant when the ad mechanism is present . under these conditions ,",
    "the dynamics of step fluctuations is described by the second - order non - conserved linear langevin equation @xmath48 here , @xmath49 is the `` step mobility '' and and @xmath50 is a non - conserved gaussian noise satisfying @xmath51 .",
    "this equation is known in the literature as the edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) equation  @xcite . in the dynamics governed by this equation ,",
    "the spatial average of the step position exhibits a random walk in time . in order to eliminate spurious effects of this random - walk behavior ,",
    "we adopt the convention of measuring the step position from its instantaneous spatial average .",
    "thus , from now on , the variable @xmath1 will be used to denote the deviation of the step position at point @xmath2 and time @xmath0 from its spatial average at that time .",
    "the ad mechanism freezes out at low temperatures and the primary mechanism of fluctuations in this regime is the step - edge diffusion ( sed ) of atoms  @xcite .",
    "the noise is clearly conserving in this case : the integral of @xmath1 over the length of the step does not change as atoms diffuse along the step edge .",
    "step edge fluctuations under these conditions are described by the fourth - order conserved langevin equation @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "it is easy to check that eqs.([eweqn ] ) and ( [ conseqn ] ) lead to the same equilibrium behavior at long times , but due to the conserved nature of the noise , the dynamics governed by eq.([conseqn ] ) strictly conserves the integral of @xmath1 over @xmath2 .",
    "the deterministic part of the langevin equation ( [ conseqn ] ) is the same as that in the so - called mullins - herring equation for surface growth  @xcite , but the noise in the mullins - herring equation is non - conserving . in a general situation ,",
    "both ad and sed may be present .",
    "however , theoretical studies  @xcite suggest that a single mass transport mechanism will be dominant for most physical systems .",
    "therefore , we can make the simplifying assumption of considering each mechanism separately , and study the dynamics governed by one of the two langevin equations , ( [ eweqn ] ) and ( [ conseqn ] ) .    all space and time - dependent correlation functions for these two linear langevin equations can be calculated analytically .",
    "the equilibrium distribution of @xmath1 is gaussian with zero mean and width equal to the root - mean - square width of the step , @xmath54 , with @xmath55 .",
    "the mean - square difference in the step positions at two different points along the step at the same time is given by @xmath56 ^ 2",
    "\\rangle \\propto x^{2\\alpha } , \\label{gx}\\ ] ] at equilibrium for @xmath57 .",
    "note that this dependence on @xmath2 is the same as the dependence of the mean - square displacement on time in a 1d random walk .",
    "in fact , the spatial statistics of @xmath34 in the equilibrium state is identical to the temporal statistics of the displacement in brownian motion in one dimension .",
    "although the two langevin equations considered here lead to the same equilibrium behavior , time - dependent correlations are different in the two cases .",
    "the equilibrium temporal correlation function of height fluctuations at the same point decays exponentially at long times , @xmath58 , \\label{ct}\\ ] ] where the correlation time @xmath59 is proportional to @xmath60 , with @xmath61 for the ew equation and @xmath62 for the conserved fourth - order equation .",
    "also , the mean - square difference in the step positions at the same point at two different times is given by @xmath63 ^ 2 \\rangle \\propto t^{2 \\beta } , \\label{gt}\\ ] ] for @xmath64 , with @xmath65 , so that @xmath66 for the ew equation and @xmath67 for the conserved fourth - order equation .",
    "although the step fluctuation @xmath1 is a gaussian stochastic variable , its non - markovian nature makes analytic calculations of some of its first - passage properties difficult . in our studies , we used numerical integrations of the langevin equations ( [ eweqn ] ) and ( [ conseqn ] ) to evaluate some of their temporal and spatial first - passage properties . in these numerical calculations ,",
    "we used spatially discretized , dimensionless forms of the langevin equations which were integrated forward in time using a simple euler scheme .",
    "the dynamical equations considered in the numerical work are @xmath68 for the ew equation and @xmath69 for the conserved fourth - order equation . here",
    ", @xmath70 represents the step position at lattice site @xmath71 at time @xmath0 , @xmath72 are uncorrelated random variables with zero mean and unit variance , and and @xmath73 are the conserved version of such noise .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were used in these calculations and results for different system sizes were obtained from averages over a large number of independent realizations of the stochastic time evolution .    in some of our numerical studies",
    ", we also used monte carlo simulations of the dynamics of 1d atomistic solid - on - solid models that are known to belong in the same dynamical `` universality class '' as the two langevin equations mentioned above . for ew dynamics",
    ", we simulated the well - known family model  @xcite in which atoms deposited randomly , one at a time , at the latices sites are allowed to explore within a fixed diffusion length to find the lattice site with the smallest `` height '' @xmath74 where it gets incorporated .",
    "if the diffusion length is one lattice constant ( this is the value used in our simulations ) , the application of this deposition rule to a randomly selected site @xmath75 involves finding the minimum value among the set @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the height of the site with the minimum height is then increased by one . since the average height continues to grow in time in this model ,",
    "the fluctuations of interest in the present context are obtained by subtracting the instantaneous spatial average from the variables @xmath78 . an atomistic model proposed by racz _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite provides a discrete realization of the conserved dynamics of eq.([conseqn ] ) . in this model ,",
    "the nearest - neighbor height differences are restricted to @xmath79 . in one simulation step , a site @xmath75 is randomly chosen . a diffusion move to",
    "a randomly chosen neighbor takes place if the above restrictive condition is satisfied after the move ; otherwise a new random site is selected and the procedure follows in the same way . in these atomistic simulations , `` time '' is measured in units of attempted depositions or moves per lattice site .",
    "the experimental results reviewed here were all extracted from variable - temperature scanning tunneling microscope ( vt - stm ) measurements of monatomic steps on solid surfaces . in this section ,",
    "experimental concerns generic to all stm - based measurements of first - passage statistics are addressed .",
    "more specific details such as surface preparation and characterization can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "first passage measurements for surface steps have been performed under ultra - high vacuum conditions to allow for the preparation of surfaces with well - defined and reproducible structure and chemical composition .",
    "this level of control is crucial to the interpretation of experimental results in terms of theoretical models of interface fluctuations and also allows the use of repeated measurements on identically - prepared samples to reduce fluctuations in first - passage statistics .",
    "an important experimental demonstration that the surfaces are well - enough controlled is the measurement of the distribution ( either temporal or spatial ) of displacements of the step - edge . for an equilibrium system",
    ", the distribution must be gaussian .",
    "while stm is an obvious choice for real - space imaging experiments due to its remarkable spatial resolution , it is limited as a probe of dynamics by a relatively low data acquisition rate . for most surfaces with step edges that fluctuate",
    "rapidly enough to generate useful temporal statistics , it is not possible to obtain an stm image that corresponds to a snapshot of step configurations at a single instant of time .",
    "therefore , the study of temporal step edge fluctuations often involves the use of so - called `` line - scan '' stm imaging . in this measurement ,",
    "the stm tip is fixed at a point @xmath43 and scanned in one direction perpendicular to a step edge repeatedly for a fixed measurement time .",
    "an example of a resulting line - scan pseudo - image is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and represents a time series of the evolution of the step position at @xmath43 . from this time series , @xmath80",
    ", temporal first passage statistics can be extracted as described below .",
    "example of line - scan pseudo - image of step fluctuations . in this figure , the step - edge position",
    "is denoted by @xmath34 and @xmath43 denotes the coordinate in the average step direction.,width=226,height=226 ]    the low speed of the stm creates different difficulties for the measurement of spatial first - passage statistics where snapshots corresponding to a given instant of time are required . to obtain these snapshots",
    "it is necessary to measure stm images at relatively low temperatures , where step fluctuations are slower than the rate of image acquisition , or to rapidly quench a surface from high temperature so that its step configuration is kinetically frozen  @xcite . once obtained",
    ", spatial stm images provide the step configuration at fixed time , @xmath81 , from which first - passage statistics may be extracted as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "experimentally determined spatial first - passage statistics have been found  @xcite to be noisier than the analogous temporal quantities .",
    "this arises partially due to the fact that , at large enough length scales along a step edge , there usually exist nonequilibrium features such as forced kinks due to small azimuthal crystal miscut or pinning sites due to trace contamination .",
    "therefore , the fraction of a spatial image that can be considered for quantitative analysis is usually smaller than the fraction of a temporal pseudo - image .",
    "the calculation of temporal persistence and survival from line - scan stm images proceeds differently than the calculation of these quantities from spatial images or from numerical simulations . in the latter two cases ,",
    "probabilities are computed by calculating the fraction of all step sites that have not returned to the specified configuration ( either as a function of time or of distance along the step ) . for line - scan stm data that is obtained at a single point on the step edge , however ,",
    "probabilities must be computed by calculating the fraction of all time intervals for which the given step position has not returned to the specified configuration . for the measurements presented in the following sections , persistence and survival probabilities ( as well as their generalizations )",
    "are computed from different stm images and averaged to obtain smooth curves that can be fit to theoretical predictions .",
    "parameters from these fits , such as persistence exponents and survival decay constants , are quoted as the average obtained from the different measurements and the experimental error in the parameter is taken as the standard deviation ( one @xmath82 ) of the different measurements .",
    "in this section , we present our results for various temporal and spatial first - passage properties of equilibrium step fluctuations quantified in terms of the persistence and survival probabilities defined in section  [ def ] . in each case , theoretical predictions ( analytic when available and numerical ) are compared with the results obtained from stm - based experiments for systems with different microscopic mechanisms of mass transport along the step edge .      for dynamics described by the linear langevin equations ( [ eweqn ] ) and ( [ conseqn ] ) , the step - edge fluctuation @xmath1 at a fixed position @xmath2 as a function of time @xmath0 is a gaussian stochastic process , but it is not markovian .",
    "the non - markovian property arises from the presence of the spatial derivatives that generate `` interactions '' between height fluctuations at different space points .",
    "an exact analytic calculation of the persistence probability for a gaussian but non - markovian stochastic process is known  @xcite to be very difficult . in fact , the persistence probability @xmath8 can not be meanighfully defined for the langevin equations considered here if the time @xmath0 is considered to be a truly continuous variable with no short - time cutoff . as discussed in section  [ def ] , @xmath8 is defined in terms of the distribution of the time intervals between successive zero - crossings of the stochastic variable @xmath83 , with @xmath84 .",
    "time - displaced correlation functions of this quantity , which may be obtained from eq.([gt ] ) , involve the exponent @xmath85 .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that for @xmath86 , which is the case for the langevin equations considered here , the density of zero crossings is infinite  once the process crosses zero , it immediately crosses zero again many times before making a long excursion to the next zero crossing . in this case , the persistence probability can be meaningfully defined only if a short - time cutoff is imposed .",
    "this , however , is not a serious problem because langevin equations such as the ones considered here are to be understood as coarse - grained descriptions with naturally occurring short - time and short - distance cutoffs .",
    "also , in experiments and simulations , the step position is measured at discrete time intervals , so that the smallest value of @xmath0 for which @xmath8 needs to be defined is the sampling interval @xmath87 . for this reason , there is no practical difficulty in measuring @xmath8 in experiments and simulations , although the mathematical problem mentioned above implies that an exact analytic calculation of @xmath8 for the models considered here is not possible .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that for linear langevin equation of the type being considered here , the persistence probability @xmath8 decreases in time as a power law , @xmath88 , for @xmath89 where @xmath90 is short - time cutoff .",
    "it was also shown that the _ persistence exponent _ @xmath91 , where @xmath85 is the exponent defined in eq.([gt ] ) .",
    "this result was obtained from a scaling argument and confirmed by simulations .",
    "the scaling argument is based on the observation that the incremental autocorrelation function of the variable @xmath92 defined above has a power - law form with exponent @xmath85 , @xmath93 ^ 2\\rangle \\propto |t_1-t_2|^{2\\beta } , \\label{fbm}\\ ] ] in the equilibrium state .",
    "this implies that the stochastic process @xmath92 is a _ fractional brownian motion _",
    "@xcite with hurst exponent @xmath85 .",
    "for such a process , it is known that the probability that , given it has crossed zero at time @xmath94 , it returns to zero after time @xmath95 is proportional to @xmath96 , and @xmath97 , the total number of zero - crossings up to time @xmath98 is proportional to @xmath99 . also , from the definition of the persistence exponent @xmath100",
    ", it is clear that the number of zero - crossing intervals of length between @xmath95 and @xmath101 in the total interval @xmath98 is given by @xmath102 using the relation , @xmath103 and equating powers of @xmath98 on both sides of this equation , one then obtains the result , @xmath91 .",
    "simulations carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite and also by us have established the validity of this relation for the langevin equations for step fluctuation .",

    "previous experiments  @xcite lead to the conclusion that the fluctuations in this system arise from the random exchange of mass between the step and the terrace and that the interface should therefore be modeled using the ew equation .",
    "experimental persistence probabilities measured at three different temperatures for the al / si(111 ) surface steps are shown in fig .",
    "it is apparent from the linear behavior of the double - logarithmic plots that the persistence probability scales with time as a power law .",
    "the average persistence exponent for the al / si(111 ) surface is @xmath107 , in good agreement with the prediction of @xmath104 for the ew equation .",
    "temporal persistence probabilities have also been extracted for metal surfaces of pb(111 ) and ag(111 ) where steps are known to fluctuate due to the sed mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the persistence probability has been found  @xcite to decay in time as a power law in these cases too . for steps on pb(111 ) , the persistence exponent is @xmath108 and for steps on ag(111 ) , the persistence exponent is @xmath109 .",
    "these exponents are in agreement with the value of 7/8 predicted for the conserved fourth - order langevin equation ( [ conseqn ] ) .",

    "fluctuations are essentially absent over time intervals of several minutes for temperatures below 770 k  @xcite , while at 1020 k steps fluctuate with times scales of the order of seconds  @xcite .",
    "therefore , to obtain viable information above 870 k , samples were prepared at elevated temperatures and were then quenched at an initial cooling rate of over 200 k / s to room temperature in order to capture and preserve the step - edge displacements  @xcite . in measurements of spatial first - passage properties , the spatial separation between adjacent measured points ( or pixel size ) plays the role of the sampling distance @xmath188 mentioned above .",

    "solid diamonds , squares , and circles are from ( 500 nm)@xmath204 images and have system lengths of l = 98.9 nm , 170 nm , and 162 nm respectively .",
    "open diamonds , squares , and circles are from ( 300 nm)@xmath204 images and have system lengths of l = 65.8 nm , 154 nm , and 87 nm respectively .",

    "@xcite).,width=453,height=302 ]    spatial persistence and survival probabilities were measured for al / si(111 ) surfaces representing spatial equilibrium over temperatures of 7201070 k. the images used in these measurements were of two sizes , ( 300 nm)@xmath204 and ( 500 nm)@xmath204 , measured with pixel sizes 0.586 nm and 0.977 nm respectively .",
    "each step image used for this analysis was cropped from a larger original stm image , yielding a distribution of effective system sizes @xmath47 but the same value of the pixel size @xmath188 .",
    "experimental data were analyzed to determine both the spatial persistence and survival probabilities versus distance @xmath2 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] . the same persistence curve is shown in the inset using logarithmic axes to illustrate more clearly the power - law behavior .",
    "deviations from the power - law fit at large distances stem from limited statistics at large @xmath2 , as well as possible effects of finite measurement size issues .",
    "the average of the persistence curves for all the steps in each image was fit to a power law to extract the persistence exponent @xmath179 .",
    "no systematic dependence on temperature was observed , similar to the lack of temperature - dependence observed for the temporal persistence .",
    "an analysis of the averaged persistence probabilities over all the temperatures results in a persistence exponent of @xmath205 , in excellent agreement with the theoretical value of 1/2 .",
    "the measured survival curves @xmath198 showed a great deal of variability , but scaling the distance @xmath2 by the length @xmath47 of the step caused the curves to collapse onto one another , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "no systematic effect of the ratio @xmath206 on the linear region of the semi - logarithmic plots in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] was observed .",
    "fits of the scaled survival probabilities to an exponential form gave good results for short distances ( @xmath207 ) , with an average value of the scaled decay length @xmath208 with a temperature - dependence smaller in magnitude than the experimental uncertainty in the data .",
    "the fit of the short - distance survival data to an exponential form with a fixed decay length is , in fact , consistent with the short - distance form of the theoretical prediction  @xcite for the spatial survival probability of 1d ew interfaces .",
    "the theoretically predicted survival probability , shown as the solid line plotted in fig .  [ fig12 ] , reproduces the rapid fall - off of the survival probability at larger distances .",
    "consistent with the experimental observation , the functional form is indistinguishable from an exponential for @xmath207 , except very close to @xmath200 where the theoretical result predicts a cusp of the form @xmath209 with @xmath210 .",
    "the empirical survival length constant @xmath211 extracted from exponential fits is a useful experimental rule of thumb that provides a measure of the characteristic fluctuation length scales relative to the system size .",
    "the theoretical and experimental results summarized above provide a fairly complete description of temporal and spatial first - passage properties of the equilibrium fluctuations of isolated steps on a surface .",
    "the close agreement between theoretical ( analytic when available and numerical ) and experimental results in nearly all the cases studied provides a confirmation of several theoretical ideas about first - passage properties of dynamical fluctuations of spatially extended objects , validates the simple theoretical models used to describe these fluctuations , and establishes the usefulness of first - passage statistics in characterizing the nature of these fluctuations . due to the non - markovian nature of these fluctuations , it is difficult to carry out analytic calculations of some of the first - passage probabilities considered here . in particular ,",
    "no analytic theory is available at present for the family of persistent large deviations exponents @xmath115 and the time scales for the decay of the generalized survival probability @xmath33 and the generalized inside survival probability @xmath39 .",
    "the development of analytic theories for these quantities would be very interesting and useful .",
    "the results reviewed above also indicate that in general , the issues of discrete sampling , finite measurement time , and finite effective step length make the interpretation of non - universal aspects of persistence and survival data for step fluctuations a difficult prospect . these difficulties do not detract from the remarkably successful interplay between experiment and theory that has enhanced fundamental understanding of the statistical physics of model 1d interfaces .",
    "nevertheless , since first - passage statistics speaks to eminently practical concerns related to structural stability , the interpretation of measurements in a material and temperature dependent context is crucial .",
    "we have shown that the dependence of first - passage probabilities on sampling parameters and effective step length can be quantified in terms of phenomenological scaling relations obtained using plausible arguments and confirmed from numerical studies .",
    "the development of a deeper ( analytic if possible ) understanding of these scaling relations would be very useful in extracting quantitative information from experimental studies of first - passage properties .",
    "the studies described here may be extended in several directions .",
    "most nonlinear models  @xcite used to describe the nonequilibrium kinetics of surface growth do not have the @xmath212 symmetry of the linear models considered here .",
    "this lack of symmetry translates into a difference between the exponents  @xcite that describe the decay of steady - state temporal persistence probabilities for positive and negative displacements of the interface from its initial position .",
    "the smaller of these two persistence exponents is known  @xcite to be equal to @xmath213 where @xmath85 is the dynamical growth exponent of the nonlinear model , but no analytic result is available for the other exponent .",
    "also , it has been found in simulations  @xcite that `` transient '' persistence exponents that describe the temporal first - passage statistics in the initial regime of interface growth from a flat initial state are different from the steady - state persistence exponents .",
    "studies of some of the other first - passage properties considered in our work for these situations would be interesting .",
    "other interesting questions that deserve attention include the effects of step - step interactions on the first - passage properties of step fluctuations and persistence and survival properties of higher - dimensional interfaces such as fluctuating membranes and growing surfaces in two dimensions .",
