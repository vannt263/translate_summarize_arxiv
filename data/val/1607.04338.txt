    "one of the most interesting avenues in the study of stellar models lies in understanding the physics of objects at the bottom of and below the hydrogen burning main sequence stars .",
    "the main obstacle in the study of very low mass ( vlm ) stars and substellar objects is their low luminosity , typically of order @xmath7 , which makes them difficult to detect .",
    "there is also a degeneracy between mass and age for these objects , which have a luminosity that decreases with time .",
    "this makes a determination of the initial mass function ( imf ) difficult in this mass regime .",
    "however in the last two decades there has been substantial observational evidence that supports the existence of faint substellar objects . since the first discovery of a brown dwarf @xcite several similar objects were identified in young clusters @xcite and galactic fields @xcite and have generated great interest among theorists and observational astronomers .",
    "the field has matured remarkably in recent years and recent summaries of the observational situation can be found in @xcite and @xcite .    in two consecutive papers , @xcite and",
    "@xcite revolutionized the understanding of low mass objects by studying the kelvin - helmholtz time scale and structure of very low mass stars .",
    "he successfully estimated that stars below about @xmath8 contract to a radius of about @xmath9 in about @xmath10 years , which was a correction to the earlier estimate of @xmath11 years .",
    "the earlier calculation was based on the understanding that low mass stars evolve horizontally in the h - r diagram and thus evolve with a low luminosity for a long period of time .",
    "however , @xcite showed that such low mass stars remain fully convective during the pre - main sequence evolution and are much more luminous than the previously accepted model based on radiative equilibrium .",
    "kumar s analysis showed that for a critical mass of @xmath12 , the time scale has a maximum value that decreases on either side .",
    "although this crude model neglected any nuclear reactions , it did give a very close estimate of the time scale .",
    "the second paper @xcite gave more detailed insight on the structure of the interior of low mass stars .",
    "this model was based on the non - relativistic degeneracy of electrons in the stellar interior .",
    "kumar s extensive numerical analysis for a particular abundance of hydrogen , helium and other chemical compositions yielded a limiting mass below which the central temperature and density are never high enough to fuse hydrogen . a more exact analysis required a detailed understanding of the atmosphere and surface luminosity of such contracting stars .",
    "the next major breakthrough in theoretical understanding came from the work of @xcite , who studied the pre - main sequence evolution of low mass stars in the degenerate limit . although it was predicted that there exist low mass objects that can not fuse hydrogen , the internal structure of these objects remained a mystery .",
    "a complete theory demanded a better understanding of the physical mechanisms which govern the evolution of these objects .",
    "it became essential to develop a complete equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "@xcite used numerical simulations to study the evolution of vlm stars and brown dwarfs for population i chemical composition ( @xmath13 ) and different opacities .",
    "their model showed that for the same central condition ( nuclear output ) an increasing opacity reduces the surface luminosity .",
    "thus , a lower opacity causes a greater surface luminosity and subsequent cooling of the object .",
    "their results implied that the hydrogen burning minimum mass is @xmath14 for opacities considered in their model .",
    "furthermore , they showed that objects with mass close to @xmath14 spend more than a billion years at a luminosity of @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite modeled the structure of stars in the mass range @xmath16 .",
    "they used a detailed numerical model to study the effects of varying opacity , helium fraction , and the mixing length parameter , and compared their results with the existing data .",
    "their important modification was that they considered thermonuclear burning at temperatures and densities relevant for low masses .",
    "a detailed analysis of the equation of state was performed in order to study the thermodynamics of the deep interior , which contained a combination of pressure ionized hydrogen , helium nuclei , and degenerate electrons .",
    "this analysis clearly expressed the transition from brown dwarfs to very low mass stars .",
    "these two families are connected by a steep luminosity jump of two orders of magnitude for masses in the range of @xmath17 .",
    "there was a clear indication that masses in that intermediate regime do ignite hydrogen but that it eventually subsides to yield a brown dwarf .",
    "@xcite proposed a new eos for fluid hydrogen that , in particular , connects the low density limit of molecular and atomic hydrogen to the high density fully pressure - ionized plasma .",
    "they used the consistent free energy model but with the added prediction of a first order  plasma phase transition \" ( ppt ) @xcite in the intermediate regime of the molecular and the metallic hydrogen .",
    "as an application of this eos , they modelled the evolution of a hydrogen and helium mixture in the interior of jupiter , saturn , and a brown dwarf .",
    "they adopted a compositional interpolation between the pure hydrogen eos and a pure helium eos to obtain a h / he mixed eos .",
    "this was based on the additive volume rule for an extensive variable @xcite and allowed calculations of the h / he eos for any mixing ratio of hydrogen and helium .",
    "their analysis suggested that the cooling of a brown dwarf with a ppt proceeds much more slowly than in previous models @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented a detailed theoretical review of brown dwarfs .",
    "his simplified eos related pressure and density for degenerate electrons and for ions in the ideal gas approximation .",
    "although corrections due to coulomb pressure and exchange pressure are of physical relevance , they together contribute less than @xmath18 in comparison to the other dominant term in the pressure - density relationship for massive brown dwarfs ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the theoretical analysis gave a very good understanding of the behavior of the central temperature @xmath20 as a function of radius and degeneracy parameter @xmath21 .",
    "@xcite discussed the thermal properties of the interior of brown dwarfs and provided an approximate expression for the entropy in the interior and in the atmosphere of a brown dwarf .",
    "he also derived an expression for the effective temperature as a function of mass .    a method to use the surface lithium abundance as a test for brown dwarf candidates",
    "was proposed by @xcite .",
    "lithium fusion occurs at a temperature of about @xmath22 , which is easily attainable in the interior of the low mass stars .",
    "however brown dwarfs below the mass of @xmath23 never develop this core temperature .",
    "they will then have the same lithium abundance as the interstellar medium independent of their age .",
    "however , for objects slightly more massive than @xmath24 , the core temperature can eventually reach @xmath25 .",
    "they deplete lithium in the core and the entire lithium content gets exhausted rapidly due to the convection .",
    "this causes significant change in the observable photospheric spectra . thus lithium can act as a brown dwarf diagnostic @xcite as well as a good age detector @xcite .",
    "following this , an extensive review on the analytic model of brown dwarfs was presented by @xcite .",
    "they presented an elaborate discussion on the atmosphere and the interior of brown dwarfs and the lower edge of the hydrogen burning main sequence .",
    "based on the convective nature of these low mass objects , they modelled them as polytropes of order @xmath26 .",
    "once again the atmospheric model was approximated based on a matching entropy condition of the plasma phase transition between molecular hydrogen at low density and ionized hydrogen at high density .",
    "the polytropic approximation enabled the calculation of the nuclear burning luminosity within the core adiabatic density profile @xcite .",
    "while the luminosity did diminish with time in the substellar limit , the model did show that brown dwarfs can undergo hydrogen burning for a substantial period of time before it eventually ceases .",
    "the critical mass deduced from this model did indeed match that obtained from more sophisticated numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "in this work we give a general outline of the analytic model of the structure and the evolution of brown dwarfs .",
    "we advance some aspects of the existing analytic model by introducing a modification to the equation of state .",
    "we also discuss some of the unresolved problems like estimation of the surface temperature and the existence of ppt in the brown dwarf environment .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the derivation of a more accurate equation of state for a partially degenerate fermi gas .",
    "we incorporates a finite temperature correction to the expression for the fermi pressure to give a more general solution to the fermi integral . in section 3",
    "we discuss the scaling laws for various thermodynamic quantities for an analytic polytrope model of index @xmath26 . in section 4",
    "we discuss the derivation of the equations @xcite connecting the photospheric ( surface ) temperature with density , where the entropies at the interior and the exterior are matched using the first order phase transition . in the spirit of an analytic model we derive simplified analytic expressions for the specific entropies above and below the ppt .",
    "we also highlight the need to seek alternate methods given current concerns about the relevance of the ppt in bd interiors .",
    "we discuss the nuclear burning rates for low mass objects in section 5 and determine the nuclear luminosity @xmath27 @xcite . in section 6",
    "we estimate the range of minimum mass required for stable sustainable nuclear burning . in section 7 , we discuss a cooling model and examine the evolution of photospheric properties over time . in section 8 , we estimate the number fraction of stars that enters the main sequence after more than a million years . in the concluding section ,",
    "we discuss further possibilities for an improved and generalized theoretical model of brown dwarfs .",
    "in main sequence stars , the thermal pressure due to nuclear burning balances the gravitational pressure and the star can sustain a large radius and nondegenerate interior for a long period of time .",
    "however substellar objects like brown dwarfs fail to have a stable hydrogen burning sequence and instead derive their stability from electron degeneracy pressure .",
    "a simple but accurate model needs to have a good equation of state that incorporates the degeneracy effect and the ideal gas behaviour at a relative higher temperature . @xcite",
    "give a pressure law that applies to both the extremes but has a poor connection in the intermediate zone .",
    "@xcite also gives an empirical relation for the pressure that does include an approximate correction term to connect the two extremes . here",
    ", in order to obtain a more accurate analytic expression for the pressure , we integrate the fermi - dirac integral exactly using the polylogarithm functions @xmath28 .",
    "the most general expression for the pressure is    @xmath29     + @xcite , where @xmath30 for the fermi gas and @xmath31 and the other variables are the standard constants . for substellar objects ,",

    "hence the exponential goes to zero as @xmath40 .",
    "thus the integral reduces to the fermi pressure at zero temperature .",
    "however in a physical situation at finite temperature , the integral can be solved analytically using the polylogs .",
    "the details of the exact derivation for a general fermi integral are shown in appendix a. the expression for the pressure of a degenerate fermi gas at finite temperature is @xmath41 the above expression for pressure is the most general analytic relation for the pressure of a degenerate fermi gas at a finite temperature .",

    "the development of a theoretical model for studying the variation of surface luminosity over time for low mass stars ( lms ) and brown dwarfs is a great challenge .",
    "there is no stable phase of nuclear burning for brown dwarfs and the luminosity gradually decreases with time .",
    "this leads to an age - mass degeneracy in observational determinations .",
    "our lack of knowledge in understanding the physics of the interior of brown dwarfs restricts the development of a comprehensive model .",
    "however , extensive simulations were done on the molecular - metallic transition of hydrogen for lms and planets .",

    "this new temperature regime is certainly too low for brown dwarfs .",

    "<S> we present the current status of the analytic theory of brown dwarf evolution and the lower mass limit of the hydrogen burning main sequence stars . in the spirit of a simplified analytic theory </S>",
    "<S> we also introduce some modifications to the existing models . </S>",
    "<S> we give an exact expression for the pressure of an ideal non - relativistic fermi gas at a finite temperature , therefore allowing for non - zero values of the degeneracy parameter ( @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the fermi energy ) . </S>",
    "<S> we review the derivation of surface luminosity using an entropy matching condition and the first - order phase transition between the molecular hydrogen in the outer envelope and the partially - ionized hydrogen in the inner region . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the results of modern simulations of the plasma phase transition , which illustrate the uncertainties in determining its critical temperature . </S>",
    "<S> based on the existing models and with some simple modification we find the maximum mass for a brown dwarf to be in the range @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> an analytic formula for the luminosity evolution allows us to estimate the time period of the non - steady state ( i.e. , non - main sequence ) nuclear burning for substellar objects . standard models also predict that stars that are just above the substellar mass limit can reach an extremely low luminosity main sequence after at least a few million years of evolution , and sometimes much longer . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that @xmath3 of stars take longer than @xmath4 yr to reach the main - sequence , and @xmath5 of stars take longer than @xmath6 yr . </S>"
