    "a periodically bent crystal together with a bunch of ultra - relativistic charged particles which undergo planar channeling constitute a crystalline undulator , see fig .",
    "[ figure1.fig ] . in such a system there appears , in addition to the well - known channeling radiation , the undulator type radiation which is due to the periodic motion of channeling particles which follow the bending of the crystallographic planes@xcite .",
    "the intensity and characteristic frequencies of this radiation can be varied by changing the beam energy and the parameters of the bending . in the cited papers as well as in subsequent publications ( see the review ref .   and the references therein ) we proved a feasibility to create a short - wave crystalline undulator that will emit high - intensity , highly monochromatic radiation when pulses of ultra - relativistic positrons are passed through its channels@xcite .",
    "a number of corresponding novel numerical results were presented to illustrate the developed theory , including , in particular , the calculation of the spectral and angular characteristics of the new type of radiation .",
    "later the importance of the novel concept of a crystalline undulator has been realized by other authors .",
    "the scheme presented in fig .",
    "[ figure1.fig ] leads also to the possibility of generating a stimulated emission of a free - electron laser type .",
    "the estimates carried out in refs",
    ".   showed that it is feasible to consider emission stimulation within the range of photon energies @xmath2 kev ( a gamma - laser ) .",
    "it was demonstrated@xcite also that the brilliance of radiation from a positron - based undulator in the energy range from hundreds of kev up to tens of mev is comparable to that of conventional light sources ( both existing and proposed ) operating for much lower photon energies .    ) which are periodically bent .",
    "the wavy line represents the trajectory of a positron which channels in between two planes , the profile of periodic bending is given by @xmath3 , where the period @xmath4 and amplitude @xmath5 satisfy the condition @xmath6 . other conditions - see eqs .",

    "once the feasibility of a positron - based crystalline undulator had been established theoretically , it has become clear that further joint theoretical and experimental efforts are needed to actually create this powerful source of radiation , the parameters of which can be easily tuned by varying the energy of the beam particles , by using different crystals and by changing the parameters of the crystal bending .",
    "all this constitute a complex , highly interdisciplinary , absolutely new and very promising field of research .",

    "the pecu project aims to develop in full the theory of of spontaneous and stimulated emission of radiation in crystalline undulator , to use both theory and experiment to investigate the best methods and materials for constructing the crystals , to carry out the experiments with the crystalline undulators .",
    "the european researchers , involved in the project , are among the world leaders in various fields of research",
    ". theoretical support of the activities within the project will be carried out by researches from frankfurt institute for advanced studies and institut fr theoretische physik ( univestitt frankfurt am main ) , whose pioneering works initiated the worldwide activity in the field . the key role in channeling experiments",

    "stable channeling of an ultra - relativistic positron in a periodically bent channel is possible if the maximum centrifugal force @xmath8 is less than the maximal interplanar force @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath10 . expressing @xmath8 through the energy @xmath11 of the projectile , the period and amplitude of the bending one formulates this condition as it is written in ( [ allconditions.5 ] ) .",
    "the operation of a crystalline undulator should be considered in the large - amplitude regime . omitting the discussion ( see ref .  )",
    ", we note that the limit @xmath12 accompanied by the condition @xmath13 is mostly advantageous , since in this case the characteristic frequencies of undulator and channeling radiation ( see , e.g. , ref .  )",
    "are well separated , so that the latter does not affect the parameters of the former , whereas the intensity of undulator radiation becomes comparable or higher than that of the channeling one@xcite .",
    "a strong inequality @xmath14 , resulting in elastic deformation of the crystal , leads to moderate values of the undulator parameter @xmath15 ( here @xmath16 ) which ensure that the emitted radiation is of the undulator type rather than of the synchrotron one@xcite .",
    "the term undulator implies that the number of periods @xmath17 is large ( here @xmath18 denotes the crystal length ) . in this case",
    "the emitted radiation bears the features of the undulator one , i.e. narrow , well - separated peaks , - harmonics , in spectral - angular distribution .",
    "therefore , the stronger the third inequality is the more pronounced the features are .",
    "the essential difference between a crystalline undulator and a conventional one , based on the action of a magnetic ( or electric ) field@xcite , is that in the latter the beams of particles and photons move in vacuum whereas in the former    in a crystalline medium , where they are affected by _",
    "the dechanneling and the photon attenuation_. the dechanneling effect stands for a gradual increase in the transverse energy of a channeled particle due to inelastic collisions with the crystal constituents@xcite . at some point",
    "the particle gains a transverse energy higher than the planar potential barrier and leaves the channel . the average interval for a particle to penetrate into a crystal until it dechannels",
    "is called the dechanneling length , @xmath19 . in a straight channel",
    "this quantity depends on the crystal , on the energy and the type of a projectile . in a periodically bent channel",
    "there appears an additional dependence on the parameter @xmath20 .",
    "the intensity of the photon flux , which propagates through a crystal , decreases due to the processes of absorption and scattering .",
    "the interval within which the intensity decreases by a factor of @xmath21 is called the attenuation length , @xmath22 .",
    "this quantity is tabulated for a number of elements and for a wide range of photon frequencies ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "the forth condition in ( [ allconditions.5 ] ) takes into account severe limitation of the allowed values of the length @xmath18 of a crystalline undulator due to the dechanneling and the attenuation .",
    "finally , let us comment on the last condition in ( [ allconditions.5 ] ) . for sufficiently large photon energies ( @xmath23 kev ) the restriction due to the attenuation becomes less severe than due to the dechanneling effect@xcite .",
    "then , @xmath24 introduces an upper limit on the length of a crystalline undulator .",
    "indeed , it was demonstrated@xcite that in the limit @xmath25 the intensity of radiation is not defined by the expected number of undulator periods @xmath26 but rather is formed in the undulator of the effective length @xmath27 . since for an ultra - relativistic particle @xmath28@xcite , it seems natural that to increase the effective length one can consider higher energies .",
    "however , at this point another limitation manifests itself@xcite .",
    "the coherence of an undulator radiation is only possible when the energy loss @xmath29 of the particle during its passage through the undulator is small , @xmath30 .",
    "this statement together with the fact , that for an ultra - relativistic projectile @xmath29 is mainly due to the photon emission@xcite , leads to the conclusion that @xmath18 must be much smaller than the radiation length @xmath31 , - the distance over which a particle converts its energy into radiation .    for a positron - based crystalline undulator a thorough analysis of the system ( [ allconditions.5 ] )",
    "was carried out for the first time in refs .  .",
    "for a number of crystals the ranges of @xmath11 , @xmath5 , @xmath4 and @xmath32 were established within which the operation of the crystalline undulator is possible .",
    "these ranges include @xmath33 gev , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 kev and are common for all the investigated crystals . the importance of exactly this regime of operation of the positron - based crystalline undulator was later realized by other authors@xcite .",
    "at the initial stage of the pecu project@xcite two experiments on the measurement of the photon yield from positron - based crystalline undulators are planned to be carried out at cern and infn laboratories . due to",
    "the experimental conditions and methods of preparations of periodically bent crystalline structures several parameters of the crystalline undulator are pre - set .",
    "these parameters include@xcite :    * the positron beam energy is fixed at @xmath37 mev in the infn experiment and at @xmath38 gev in the cern one . *",
    "the crystalline undulators are to be produced by two methods .",
    "the first method utilizes the technology of growing si@xmath0ge@xmath1 structures . in this case , by varying the ge content @xmath39 one can obtain periodically bent crystalline structure @xcite .",
    "the technological restrictions imposed by this method on the crystalline undulator length is that @xmath40 m .",
    "+ the periodic bending can also be achieved by making regularly spaced grooves on the crystal surface@xcite . in this case , the crystalline planes in the vicinity of the defects become periodically bent . for the experiment within pecu a number of si crystals prepared by laser - ablation method",
    "are available@xcite .",
    "the length of such crystalline undulators is @xmath41 or 4 mm , and the period of the structure is 50 , 100 and 200 @xmath42 m . * a severe restriction on the emitted photon energy",
    "is anticipated in the infn experiment where the experimental setup allows to register only @xmath43 kev photons .",
    "theoretical support for these experiments implied to provide an initial analysis of other parameters which can be varied in the crystalline undulators described above , and , as a final result , to establish the ranges of parameters which lead to the highest yield of the undulator radiation .",
    "partly , the results of such analysis we present in sections [ undulator1 ] and [ undulator2 ] for the following two cases ( labeled below in the paper as undulator 1 and undulator 2 ) : @xmath44",
    "for the sake of reference let us outline the basic formulae which we used in our calculations . a more detailed description of the formalism one can find in refs .  .",
    "the spectral distribution of the energy @xmath45 of radiation emitted in a crystalline undulator in the forward direction ( i.e. , @xmath46 with respect to the @xmath47 axis , see fig .",
    "[ figure1.fig ] ) can be written in the following form@xcite : @xmath48 ^ 2 { { \\cal d}}_n(\\eta ) , \\label{dechannelingandattenuation.1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the fine structure constant , @xmath16 , @xmath50 is the anger s",

    "the parameter @xmath53 is related to the frequency @xmath32 of the emitted radiation as follows @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the undulator frequency .",
    "the integer values of @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath56 define the frequencies @xmath57 of harmonics .",
    "the factor @xmath58 on the right - hand side of ( [ dechannelingandattenuation.1 ] ) ensures that only odd harmonics are emitted in the forward direction .",
    "we also note that in this case the anger s functions @xmath59 reduce to the bessel functions @xmath60",
    "( e.g. , ref .  ) , so that the expression in the square brackets acquires the form known in the theory of undulator radiation@xcite .",
    "a peculiar feature of the undulator radiation , which clearly distinguishes it from other types of electromagnetic radiation by a charge moving in external fields , is that for each value of the emission angle ( and , in particular , for @xmath61 ) the spectral distribution consists of a set of narrow and equally spaced peaks corresponding to different harmonics . in an ideal undulator ( i.e. , in which positrons and photons propagate in vacuum ) the peak intensity is proportional to the squared number of periods .",
    "formally , it follows from the fact that @xmath62 is proportional to @xmath63 which behaves as @xmath64 for @xmath65@xcite .",
    "this factor reflects the constructive interference of radiation emitted from each of the undulator periods and is typical for any system which contains @xmath66 coherent emitters .",
    "consequently , in an ideal undulator one can , in principle , increase unrestrictedly the radiated intensity by increasing of the undulator length @xmath18 which , for a fixed @xmath4 , defines the number of undulator periods .",
    "the situation is different for a crystalline undulator , where the number of channeling particles and the number of photons which can emerge from the crystal decrease with the growth of @xmath18 . in ref .",
    "we analyzed quantitatively the influence of the dechanneling and the photon attenuation on the spectral - angular distribution .",
    "the main result of these studies reads that the peak intensity of the radiation is no longer proportional to @xmath64 . omitting the discussion , which can be found in the cited papers , we mention that in a crystalline undulator the factor @xmath67 must be substituted with @xmath68 , which depends not only on @xmath66 and @xmath53 but also on the ratios @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",

    "its main features can be easily understood .",
    "the most important is that , as in the case of an ideal undulator ( to which @xmath68 reduces in the limit @xmath76 ) the main maxima of @xmath68 correspond to the integer values of @xmath53 , and , therefore , the harmonic frequencies are still defined by ( [ dspectral.4 ] ) with @xmath77 . for finite @xmath24 and @xmath78 the maximum value of @xmath68 is smaller than @xmath64 whereas the width of the peak is larger than that in the corresponding ideal undulator .    to complete the descriptive part of the paper",
    "let us mention the method used to calculate the dechanneling and the attenuation length .",
    "the dechanneling length @xmath79 in a periodically bent crystal is expressed via the dechanneling length @xmath80 in the straight crystal as follows@xcite : @xmath81 here @xmath82 is the interplanar distance , @xmath83 is the thomas - fermi radius of the crystal atom .",
