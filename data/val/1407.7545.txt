    "one of the paramount problems in modern cosmology is to elucidate how the first generation of luminous objects , stars , accreting black holes ( bhs ) and galaxies , shaped the early universe at the end of the cosmic dark ages @xcite .",
    "a key driver of this grand cosmic transformation was the gradual enrichment of the pristine universe with heavy chemical elements in the wake of the first supernova ( sn ) explosions ( reviewed in * ? ? ? * ) . according to the modern theory of cosmological structure formation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , the hierarchical assembly of dark matter ( dm ) halos provided the gravitational potential wells that allowed gas to form stars and galaxies inside them . extending this model to the highest redshifts , one can determine the sites where the first stars , the so - called population  iii ( pop  iii ) , formed out of the pure h / he gas created in the big bang . within this framework ,",
    "pop  iii stars are predicted to form inside of dm minihalos with total masses ( dm and gas ) of about @xmath8 at redshifts of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the first stars affected the early universe in several different ways .",
    "massive pop  iii stars were strong emitters of hydrogen and helium ionizing photons that built up extensive h  ii , he  ii , and he  iii regions @xcite .",
    "the metals forged in pop  iii stars later were dispersed into the intergalactic medium ( igm ) when they died as sne , thus quickly polluting the primordial gas such that the second generation of ( population  ii ) stars could emerge .",
    "it is convenient to classify pop  iii feedback mechanisms into different classes ( ciardi & ferrara 2005 ) , specifically radiative feedback @xcite , mechanical and chemical feedback due to sne @xcite , and x - ray feedback from accreting bh remnants @xcite .    in the pop",
    "iii star - forming regions , metal cooling was absent because the primordial gas consisted almost exclusively of hydrogen ( @xmath10 by mass ) and helium ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "molecular hydrogen was thus the dominant coolant , but owing to its quantum - mechanical structure , it was unable to cool the gas to the low temperatures typically encountered in star forming clouds today .",
    "the primordial gas , therefore , remained relatively warm , with typical temperatures of several hundred kelvin .",
    "hence the jeans mass was correspondingly larger , as well , leading to the expectation that pop  iii stars might have been more massive than stars formed today , with a predicted mass scale of @xmath12 @xcite . because of their high surface temperatures @xcite , pop  iii stars could effectively produce copious amounts of ionizing uv photons .",
    "extended h  ii regions with size of several kpc were created before the stars died .",
    "given the shallowness of the gravitational potential well of the host dm halos , the surrounding gas was subject to strong photo - heating , thus being able to easily escape the host minihalos @xcite .",
    "this photo - evaporation suppressed further star formation inside the minihalos , thus delaying further star formation until more massive host halos emerged @xcite .",
    "the character of pop  iii feedback sensitively depends on the fate encountered by massive pop  iii stars when they die after their short lifetime of a few million years to trigger a sn explosion , or directly collapse into black holes . those pop  iii stars with masses of @xmath13 - @xmath14",
    "are thought to die as pair - instability supernovae ( psne ) @xcite , although this mass range may have to be revised in the case of rapidly rotating progenitors @xcite .",
    "unlike gravitationally - powered core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) , psne are hyper - energetic thermonuclear explosions , not leaving any compact remnant behind .",
    "because vast amounts of metals are ejected during a psn explosion , even a single event could enrich about @xmath15 of primordial gas up to @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "even such a trace amount of metals could change the subsequent star formation process and might cause a transition of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) from the top - heavy mode predicted for pop  iii stars to the standard imf for later ( pop  i and pop  ii ) generations with typical masses comparable to that of our sun @xcite .",
    "results from stellar archaeology @xcite , which studies the most metal - poor stars in the local group that retained the imprints from nucleosynthesis in the early universe , possibly including those from pop  iii stars , in general do not support the chemical abundance pattern predicted for psn enrichment @xcite .",
    "theoretical psn yields exhibit a pronounced odd - even effect resulting from a low neutron excess @xcite .",
    "in addition , the lack of any neutron capture process results in the absence of all elements heavier than the fe peak ( no r- or s - process ) .",
    "the pop  iii ccsn models @xcite , however , can produce abundance patterns in good accord with the observation of metal poor stars .",
    "recent simulations of pop  iii star formation that take into account the radiation - hydrodynamical feedback from the growing central protostar have shown that accretion can be halted , thus preventing the formation of stars more massive than 50 @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "that implies that pop  iii stars typically might die in a ccsn , instead of a psn , in agreement with the observations .",
    "furthermore , recent cosmological simulations with extremely high resolution have shown that the primordial gas cloud is able to fragment and produce stars of relatively lower mass of tens of solar masses @xcite , organized in binaries or multiple stellar systems .",
    "these simulations suggest that binary systems may be the typical channel for primordial star formation in minihalos @xcite .",
    "since these simulations only follow the protostellar assembly process for at most @xmath18yr , it is not yet clear how the final mass spectrum will look like @xcite .",
    "one key uncertainty is the degree of merging of neighboring protostars @xcite .",
    "however , it appears likely that the first stars in minihalos typically formed in binary or small multiple systems .",
    "since the evolution of binary systems and their final fate are very different from those of single stars , it is worthwhile to investigate whether binary pop  iii stars lead to significantly altered feedback effects .",
    "since their evolution is quite different from a single star , it is worth investigating how the pop  iii binary systems affected the igm and their host halos that later merged into the first galaxies @xcite .",
    "the evolving binaries might exert different feedback mechanisms , through the emission of uv and x - ray ionizing photons , and sn explosions , all of which may be quite different from the feedback of the single stars which has been well documented in the literature .",
    "therefore , we first study the impact of the first massive stars of masses @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 on their parent halos .",
    "we study the possible impacts of the first binary systems on the igm and present the results of cosmological simulations by considering possible outcomes of the pop  iii binary models with stars of @xmath2+@xmath3 ( s45+s15 ) and @xmath1+@xmath1 ( s30+s30 ) .",
    "our binary models consider the non - interacting binaries during their stellar evolution .",
    "however , more realistic binary models might have a much wider range of outcomes @xcite .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section  2 , we describe our initial setup , as well as our numerical methods .",
    "a discussion of our protostellar evolution models , both for single and binary stars , follows in section  3 .",
    "the simulation results are presented in section  [ results ] , and we conclude by discussing the broader implications in section  [ flms_discussion ] .",
    "all of the results presented in this paper use physical coordinates instead of comoving coordinates .",
    "the primary code used for our simulations is the well - tested , massively - parallel cosmological code ` gadget ` @xcite , which computes gravitational forces with a hierarchical tree algorithm and represents fluids by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) . in order to simulate the feedback exerted by the first stars , additional physical processes , such as cooling and chemistry of the primordial gas , radiative transfer of ionizing photons , and sn explosions , are required and have been implemented in `",
    "gadget ` .",
    "our simulations employ the same initial conditions as in @xcite , starting at @xmath19 in a periodic box of linear size of @xmath20 ( co - moving ) .",
    "we choose @xmath21cdm cosmological parameters with matter density @xmath22 , baryon density @xmath23 , hubble constant @xmath24@xmath25 , spectral index @xmath26 , and normalization @xmath27 , based on the wmap cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) measurement @xcite .",
    "@xcite used a standard hierarchical zoom - in technique , generating the highest mass resolution covering the lagrangian region where the first galaxy is destined to form .",
    "that way , all the relevant fine - structure , specifically the minihalo progenitors of the first galaxy , can be resolved .",
    "the resulting mass of the dm and gas particles in the highest resolution region is @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively . because the molecular hydrogen cooling in primordial gas imprints a characteristic density of @xmath30 and temperature of @xmath31 @xcite",
    ", our simulations marginally resolve the corresponding jeans mass of @xmath32 .",
    "our cooling module and chemistry network are based on @xcite , and include all relevant cooling mechanisms of primordial gas , such as h and he collisional ionization , excitation and recombination cooling , bremsstrahlung , and inverse compton cooling ; in addition , the collisional excitation cooling via @xmath33 and hd is also taken into account . for @xmath33 cooling ,",
    "collisions with protons and electrons are explicitly included .",
    "the chemical network includes @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , d , @xmath36 , and hd .",
    "state - of - the - art cosmological simulations can potentially use billions of particles to model the formation of the universe .",
    "however , it is still extremely challenging to resolve mass scales from galaxies ( 10@xmath37 ) to individual stars ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "for example , the resolution length in our simulation is about @xmath39 , many orders of magnitude removed from truly stellar scales .",
    "hence , modeling the process of star formation on cosmological scales from first principles is currently still out of reach . a viable strategy to treat star formation and",
    "its feedback is to employ sub - grid models , where sink particles approximately represent unresolved single stars , or clusters thereof .",
    "the sinks can then act as sources of radiation , with luminosities and spectra chosen in accordance with stellar structure and evolution models , and eventually as sites for sn explosions .",
    "another reason to use sink particles is to overcome the so - called ` courant myopia ' . when the gas density somewhere inside the computational box becomes increasingly high , the sph smoothing length decreases , in turn enforcing the adoption of smaller and smaller timesteps , according to the courant condition .",
    "when encountering a runaway collapse , the simulation would effectively grind to a halt or fail .",
    "creating sink particles allows us to bypass this numerical bottleneck , such that the simulations can be followed beyond the initial collapse , where much of the interesting physics , related to the stellar feedback , occurs .",
    "we here apply the sink particle algorithm of @xcite .",
    "the key criterion for sink creation , and subsequent accretion of further sph particles , is that the gas density exceeds a pre - specified density threshold , @xmath40 , but we also test for gravitational boundedness , and whether the gas is part of a converging flow , where @xmath41 .",
    "the sink particles provide markers for the position of a pop  iii star and its remnants , such as a black hole or sn , to which detailed sub - grid physics can be supplied .      when a pop  iii star has formed inside the minihalo , the sink particle representing it immediately turns into a point source of ionizing photons to mimic the birth of a star .",
    "the rate of ionizing photons emitted depends on the physical size of the star and its surface temperature based on our stellar subgrid models . instead of simply assuming constant rates of emission",
    ", we use the results of one - dimensional stellar evolution calculations from @xcite to construct the luminosity history of pop  iii stars .",
    "indeed , luminosities exhibit considerable time variability when taking the evolution off the main sequence into account .",
    "the photons streaming from the star then establish an ionization front and build up h  ii regions . to trace the propagation of photons and the ionization front , we use the ray - tracing algorithm from @xcite , which solves the ionization front equation in a spherical grid by tracking @xmath42 rays",
    "with 500 logarithmically spaced radial bins around the photon source .",
    "the radiation transport is coupled to the hydrodynamics of the gas through its chemical and thermal evolution .",
    "the transfer of the @xmath43-dissociating photons in the lyman ",
    "werner ( lw ) band ( @xmath44 ) is also included .    for completeness",
    ", we here briefly present the key features of the ray - tracing algorithm , and refer the reader to @xcite for details and tests . to begin with",
    ", particle positions are transformed from cartesian to spherical coordinates , i.e. radius ( @xmath45 ) , zenith angle ( @xmath46 ) , and azimuth angle ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the effective volume of each particle is @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the sph smoothing length .",
    "the corresponding sizes in spherical coordinates are @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "using spherical coordinates facilitates the convenient calculation of the ionization front around the star , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the position of the ionization front , @xmath55 represents the number of ionizing photons emitted from the star per second , @xmath56 is the case b recombination coefficient , and @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 are the number densities of neutral particles , electrons , and positively charged ions , respectively .",
    "the recombination coefficient is assumed to be constant at temperatures around @xmath60 .",
    "the ionizing photon rates are @xmath61 where @xmath62 is planck s constant , @xmath63 the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath64 the relevant photo - ionization cross section , and @xmath65 the ionization threshold for h  i , he  i , and he  ii . by assuming a blackbody spectrum with effective temperature , @xmath66 , the flux of a pop  iii star",
    "can be written @xmath67 the size of the h  ii region is determined by solving equation  [ rad1 ] .",
    "the particles within the h  ii regions store information about their distance from the star , which is used to calculate the ionization and heating rates ,    @xmath68    @xmath69     @xmath70 is the most important coolant for cooling the primordial gas , which leads to formation of the first stars . however , its hydrogen bond is weak and can be easily broken by photons in the lw bands between 11.2 and 13.6 ev .",
    "the small @xmath33 fraction in the igm creates only a little optical depth for lw photons , allowing them to propagate a much larger distance than ionizing photons . in our algorithm ,",
    "self - shielding of h@xmath71 is not included because it is only important when h@xmath71 column densities are high .",
    "here we treat the photodissociation of @xmath33 in the optically thin limit and the dissociation rate in a volume constrained by causality within a radius , @xmath72 .",
    "the dissociation rate is given by @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the flux within lw bands @xcite .",
    "a compact binary may be able to produce radiative feedback in the form of x - rays . in this section",
    ", we describe the treatment of the radiation from such an x - ray binary source , if present .",
    "our methodology is based on @xcite . in the local universe ,",
    "the non - thermal emission spectrum from accreting back holes or neutron stars can be expressed as @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the spectral index .",
    "more precisely , the full spectrum is a combination of a power - law component , representing non - thermal synchrotron radiation with the luminosity formula @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the bondi - holye accretion model @xcite , and a thermal multi - color disk component .",
    "we here ignore the latter , as we are only interested in the x - ray feedback on the general igm , where only the optically - thin , non - thermal photons contribute .",
    "we conservatively assume that the bh emission physics in the early universe is identical to the local case , and we therefore apply the same spectra for the black holes originating from the first stars .",
    "the propagation of high - energy photons is assumed to result in an isotropic radiation field , @xmath79 , which only depends on the distance from the bh .",
    "the corresponding photo - ionization and photo - heating rates can be written as @xcite : @xmath80 where @xmath81 \\times 10^{-11 } \\hspace{0.5 cm } \\quad{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{s}}}^{-1 } .\\ ] ] and @xmath82 here @xmath83 \\times 10^{-21 } \\hspace{0.3 cm } \\quad{{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{erg}}}}\\,{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}}}\\,{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{s}}}^{-1}\\ ] ] for h  i , he  i , he  ii , respectively .",
    "@xmath84 is the corresponding number density , @xmath85 the distance from the star in units of @xmath86 , and @xmath87 the mass accretion rate .",
    "finally , @xmath88 are the fractions of the total photon energy expended in secondary ionizations @xcite .",
    "after several million years , the massive pop  iii stars eventually exhaust their fuel , and many of them might have died as supernovae or black holes . as we discussed above , the first sn explosions may be extremely powerful , accompanied by huge outputs of energy and metals . here",
    ", we briefly discuss how we model sn explosions in our cosmological simulations .",
    "when the star reaches the end of its lifetime , we initialize a sn blast wave by distributing the explosion energy among the sph particles surrounding the sink that had marked the location of the pop  iii star .",
    "because the resolution of the simulation is about 1  pc , we can not resolve individual sne in both mass and space .",
    "instead , we here select the particles within a region of 10  pc to share the supernova s thermal energy and metal yield .",
    "the gas within this region has mean temperatures about several million kelvin . on this scale ,",
    "the blast wave is still close to its energy - conserving phase .",
    "the explosion energy of hypernovae and pair - instability sne can be up to @xmath89 , whereas a conventional core - collapse sn has about @xmath90 .    mixing plays a crucial role in the transport of metals , which could be the most important coolant for subsequent star formation .",
    "we here can not resolve the fine - grained mixing due to fluid instabilities in the early sn ejecta , developing on a scale far below 1  pc .",
    "however , we approximately model the coarse - grain mixing on cosmologically relevant timescales by applying the sph diffusion scheme from @xcite .",
    "a precise treatment of the mixing of metals in cosmological simulations is not available so far because the turbulent motions responsible for mixing can cascade down to very small scales , far beyond the resolutions we can achieve now .",
    "we here , therefore , approximately model the effect of unresolved , sub - grid turbulence as a diffusion process , linking the corresponding transport coefficients to the local physical conditions at the grid scale . for further algorithmic details ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "after the sn explosion , metal cooling must be considered in the cooling network .",
    "we assume that c , o , and si are produced with solar relative abundances , which are the dominant coolants for the gas contaminated by the first sne .",
    "there are two distinct temperature regimes for these species .",
    "in low temperature gas , @xmath91 , we use a chemical network presented in @xcite , which follows the chemistry of c , c@xmath92 , o , o@xmath92 , si , si@xmath92 , and si@xmath93 , supplemental to the primordial species discussed above .",
    "this module considers the fine structure cooling of c , c@xmath92 , o , si , and si@xmath92 , whereas molecular cooling is not taken into account . at high temperatures , @xmath94 , due to the increasing number of ionization states , a full non - equilibrium treatment of metal chemistry becomes computationally prohibitive . instead of directly solving the cooling network",
    ", we use the cooling rate table based on @xcite , which gives effective cooling rates for hydrogen and helium line cooling , as well as bremsstrahlung , at different metallicities .",
    "dust cooling is not included because it would only become important at densities much higher than what is reached in our simulations .",
    "we use the pop  iii stellar models of @xmath3 ( s15 ) , @xmath1 ( s30 ) , @xmath2 ( s45 ) , and @xmath0 ( s60 ) stars from the library of @xcite . these models are non - rotating stars and we assume no mass loss during the stellar evolution .",
    "we summarize key model characteristics in table  [ flms_1ife_models ] , where we distinguish the life span of main - sequence ( ms ; central hydrogen burning ) and post - ms ( until supernova ) evolution .",
    "the s15 model evolves in total for about @xmath95 before encountering an iron core - collapse supernova with an explosion energy of @xmath96 and a metal yield of @xmath97 .",
    "similarly , the s30 , s45 , and s60 models evolve for @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , respectively . in assigning the final fate of our three most massive models ,",
    "current understanding is still quite uncertain , and we here focus on a few illustrative possibilities .",
    "specifically , in the cases of stars with masses of @xmath1 and above , we assume that they do not die as conventional iron core - collapse sne . instead , we assume that each of them either collapses into a black hole ( bh ) , triggering no explosion , or explodes as a hypernova ( hn ) with @xmath101 explosion energy , based on the collapsar model @xcite .",
    "when the star dies as a bh , all metals within the star fall back into the bh , such that no enriched material is ejected . in the hn case ,",
    "the s30 , s45 , and s60 models synthesized about @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 of heavy elements , and disperse them into the primordial igm .",
    "we summarize the possible stellar fates in table  [ flms_fate ] . for simplicity and to limit the number of cases in this study , we focus only on these simplified , limiting cases , and refer the reader to @xcite for an extended discussion of pop  iii sn models .",
    "massive pop  iii stars are strong sources of uv radiation .",
    "because of the predicted weak stellar winds from pop  iii stars @xcite , there is no notable x - ray source contributing to the ionizing photon budget resulting from such winds .",
    "the uv radiation thus exclusively emerges from the hot stellar surface .",
    "ionizing photon fluxes for all stellar models are given in figure  [ flms_photons ] , where evolutionary effects are evident .",
    "specifically , fluxes exhibit a gradual increase in the lower energy bands ( lw and h  i ) , and a decrease in the higher energy band ( he  ii ) .",
    "the hydrogen ionizing flux in the s60 model is about 10 times larger than for s15 .",
    "the flux of more energetic photons is highly sensitive to stellar mass , such that for photons capable of ionizing he  ii , their ratio is 100:10:1 for s60:s30:s15 . because the life span of each star is different , we evaluate the overall ionizing power of an individual star by calculating the total amount of ionizing photons emitted before the star dies . as shown in table  [ flms_flux ] , the s60 model produces about 2 , 3 , and 6 times more h  i , he  i , he  ii ionizing photons than s30 .",
    "the cumulative ionizing power of s60 is also much stronger than the production from four s15 models combined .",
    "this implies that the overall radiative feedback of pop  iii stars becomes weaker if their mass scale shrinks due to fragmentation .",
    "since our ray - tracing scheme can not resolve a time scale less than a year , the radiation flash from the sn itself is not included here because the sn transit only lasts for about a few weeks to months . in principle , there could be a flash of hard radiation from the shock breakout that may eventually be observable @xcite , but the total energy in this flash is small , due largely to the typically small radii of the pop  iii stars at the time of death . besides , the radiation from the subsequent main part of the supernova light curve is largely at longer wavelengths and does not contribute much to the ionization .",
    "our calculation shows that the total ionizing photon production during the sn is about @xmath105 that of the ms phase .",
    "furthermore , most of the sn explosion energy goes into the thermal and kinetic energy of the ejecta @xcite .",
    "the ubiquitous fragmentation of primordial star forming clouds allows the widespread formation of binary stars .",
    "we consider binary stars with a total mass of @xmath0 , specifically a system with two stars of equal mass ( mass ratio 1:1 ) and another one with a mass ratio of 3:1 , in accordance with current theoretical understanding . @xcite and @xcite suggest that binary stars with ( close to ) equal mass are common in the local universe .",
    "our binary models thus contain both asymmetric cases of @xmath106 pop  iii stars and symmetric ones of @xmath107 pop  iii stars . to keep the binary models simple",
    ", we do not consider binary star mergers , and neglect any mass ejection as an idealized approximation .",
    "we are aware of and advise the reader of the shortcomings of these simplifications , compared to more realistic binary models @xcite .",
    "below , we discuss the select binary scenarios considered here ( see table  [ binaryfate ] ) .    1 .",
    "* s30+s30 ( hn ) * : this model contains two @xmath1 pop  iii stars , each represented by our s30 model . we assume both stars form at the same time and evolve together for about @xmath108 , after which they both die as a hn .",
    "2 .   * s30+s30 ( bh ) * : this scenario is very similar to s30+s30 ( hn ) , but now both stars directly collapse into bhs , without triggering a sn .",
    "* s45+s15 ( bh ) * : the binary contains two stars , represented by s45 and s15 models .",
    "both of them form at the same time and evolve together for @xmath109 .",
    "subsequently , the s45 component dies as a bh , and the system becomes an x - ray binary source due to the transfer of mass from the s15 companion onto the bh .",
    "we approximately assume that the entire mass of the primary collapses into the bh , and that the system remains bound . we employ a mass transfer rate of @xmath110/yr , active for about @xmath111 . because the s15 secondary would lose much of its mass during this x - ray binary phase , we assume a white dwarf ( wd ) death , without a sn explosion .",
    "s45+s15 ( hn ) * : both stars again form at the same time and evolve together for @xmath109 , then the s45 primary dies as a hn .",
    "the s15 component evolves for another @xmath112 , then dies as a ccsn . for a wide binary ,",
    "the kick velocity is small , and the star will die essentially at the location of the original binary . however , in a close binary situation , the orbital velocity is high , and the s15 secondary would acquire a kick of about @xmath113 , assuming a binary separation of about 1  au .",
    "such a velocity might allow the star to travel close to 1  kpc before dying as a sn .",
    "in this case , the ejected s15 model could become a moving radiation source and disperse its metal production from a site quite remote from where it formed .",
    "@xcite suggested that the runaway massive stars could also contribute to the reionization of the universe . for simplicity",
    ", we do not explore this intriguing scenario in this paper .",
    "since we are considering only non - interacting cases , their resulting uv flux can easily be obtained by summing over the individual contributions from the two component stars .",
    "figure  [ fbn_photons ] shows the ionizing photon flux of the s45+s15 , s30+s30 and s60 models , respectively , and table  [ ion.binary ] lists the total number of ionizing photons emitted .",
    "the uv fluxes of the three models are comparable within a factor of 2 .",
    "however , a single star , s60 , still produces stronger flux than binary systems with the same overall mass .",
    "differences are largest in the amount of ionizing he  ii photons , as this rate is extremely sensitive to the mass of the primary .",
    "the impact of the first binary stars on the early universe can be divided into three different classes ; uv - radiation , supernova , and x - ray .",
    "the uv - radiative feedback here refers to the soft ( lw ) and hard ( ionizing ) photons produced by the binaries during their stellar evolution . to facilitate convenient comparison",
    ", we also briefly discuss the feedback from single pop  iii stars , referring the reader to the extensive literature on this topic for further detail .",
    "we note that our single star models improve on earlier treatments by including some key features , such as the realistic modeling of the time dependence of the uv fluxes in response to the underlying stellar evolution .",
    "we present the results from our cosmological simulations following the chronologically order of how the first single or binary stars evolve : birth , evolution , and demise . because the results contain many cosmological simulations of different feedback models , we summarize the stellar models , their feedbacks , and associated results in table  [ crossref ] .      the first stellar system forms inside a minihalo , with a total mass of about @xmath114 and a virial radius of @xmath115pc , located in the region with the highest mass resolution at @xmath116 .",
    "this allows us to resolve key small - scale features of the ensuing stellar feedback .",
    "once the gas density inside the star - forming cloud exceeds the threshold for sink creation , either a single star or a binary system is assumed to promptly form . by using sink particles , the realistic assembly history of a protostar via an extended phase of accretion",
    "is not modelled , which still is computationally prohibitive . instead",
    ", we assume that the sink particles immediately represent fully developed pop  iii stars , acting as sources of uv radiation .",
    "the gas inside the halo is rapidly photo - heated up to temperatures of @xmath117 .",
    "this drives the sound speed up to @xmath118 , whereas the escape velocity of the host halo is only about @xmath119 . the photo - heated gas is thus blown out of the shallow potential well of the minihalo .",
    "uv photons not only heat up the gas but also ionize the neutral hydrogen and helium . the ionization - front",
    "( i - front ) propagation begins with a short supersonic phase ( r - type ) , then switches to a subsonic phase ( d - type ) , because the i - front is trapped behind a hydrodynamical shock ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the i - front eventually breaks out , jumping ahead of the shock , and supersonically propagates into the low - density igm .",
    "since the lifetime of the individual stars is different , we compare their radiative feedback when they die and their uv radiation is terminated .",
    "we first show the resulting gas temperatures around the host minihalo in figure  [ flms_2d_rad ] . a giant bubble of hot , ionized",

    "specifically , our s60 model creates the largest bubble with a size of about @xmath121 .",
    "the s15 model , on the other hand , only gives rise to an ionized region with a size of @xmath7 , and a much cooler gas temperature .    for binary stars ,",

    "overall bubble sizes for the equal - mass models are comparable . however , there is a significant difference in the resulting he@xmath93 regions .",

    ", it greatly matters how the available stellar mass is divided among the individual components , such that the s60 model exhibits significantly larger he@xmath92 ionizing rates than the binary models of equal mass , s30+s30 , and s45+s15 .",
    "this difference may be reflected in the strength of the he@xmath4 recombination line at @xmath123 , providing a distinctive signature to distinguish between pop  iii single and binary systems , since the latter create much smaller he@xmath93 regions , for a fixed total stellar mass .    to better evaluate the impact of the radiative feedback",
    ", we map the 3d structure of the hot bubbles onto 1d radial profiles in figure  [ flms_1d_h2 ] .",
    "we first discuss the gas density profile . due to the uv photoheating",
    ", the gas density in the center of the minihalo has dropped to @xmath124 at the end of star s lifetime .",
    "the baryonic outflow extends to a radius of @xmath125 , slightly larger than the virial radius of the host halo , such that any subsequent star formation is suppressed by expelling the gas through this photo - evaporation .",
    "besides their hydrodynamic feedback , uv photons also affect the chemistry of the primordial gas by changing its ionization state , and releasing free electrons which can catalyze h@xmath71 formation .",
    "the weaker uv emission of the s15 model results in a relatively smaller h@xmath4 region , whereas those of s60 , s45 , and s30 have radii close to @xmath126 .",
    "the difference in the central gas density profile is mainly due to the duration over which photo - heating is active",
    ". binary models exhibit longer overall lifetimes , allowing the gas to escape farther into the igm , such that the resulting gas densities within the halo are lower .",
    "it is not clear whether the uv radiation can penetrate into nearby minihalos and affect their star formation or not .",
    "when the stars die , and if there are no additional heating sources , the ionized gas will cool and then recombine , eventually extinguishing the fossil h@xmath4 regions . the relevant timescales can be estimated as follows @xcite .",
    "the cooling time of primordial gas is approximately @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the cooling rate , and @xmath129 the boltzmann constant . for the recombination timescale",
    ", we estimate @xmath130 , where the recombination coefficient is @xmath131 , and the igm densities @xmath132",
    ".      the majority of pop  iii stars may finally die as supernovae or directly collapse into black holes . in this section",
    ", we discuss the supernova feedback from single and binary stars . when the stars die , we assume for simplicity that their uv radiation is immediately shut off .",
    "we employ the sn explosion energies and metal yields discussed in section  3 , depending on the properties of the progenitor star .",
    "the sn explosion creates a strong shock wave , traveling with a velocity of @xmath133 .",
    "the energy carried by the shock is able to reheat the relic h  ii region for an additional @xmath134 , assuming h  ii region radii of @xmath135 .",
    "the shock heating in the simulation is roughly about @xmath136 because the shock velocity is slowed down due to radiative cooling . after the shock dissipates ,",
    "a hot and metal - rich bubble is left behind in the igm .",
    "this bubble continues to expand for about another 5 million years , with an increasingly ill - defined boundary .",
    "eventually , the thermal energy of the initial ejecta is radiated away , and the expansion stalls .",
    "the mixing of the metals with primordial gas predominantly occurs before stalling . on the other hand ,",
    "if a single star directly dies as a black hole , no feedback is taken into account ( but see section  4.3 ) .",
    "we first discuss the combined feedback from uv radiation and supernovae / black holes , evaluated @xmath137 after the birth of the stars , in figure  [ flms_2d_all ] . at this moment",
    ", the sn blastwave has stalled .",
    "the heating from the hot sn ejecta maintains elevated ionization in the central part of the h  ii region .",
    "the chemical feedback of the s15 model is initiated by a ccsn with explosion energy of about @xmath138 and an ejected metal mass of @xmath97 .",
    "these metals are dispersed out to a radius of @xmath139 , resulting in an average metallicity of @xmath140 . according to our stellar model assumptions , the s30 , s45 , and s60 cases all die as a hypernova , dispersing 6.9 , 13.3 , and 20.7 @xmath17 of heavy elements , respectively . for the hypernova cases ,",
    "the metal - enriched bubbles have reached radial sizes of @xmath141 with corresponding metallicities of @xmath142 .",
    "although all hypernova cases exhibit a similar overall range of chemical enrichment , there are noticeable differences in the detailed distribution of metals .",
    "these differences in turn may reflect how the preceeding radiative feedback from the different model stars has shaped the gas distribution inside the igm , which could affect the transport of metals later on . to further facilitate the comparison between the single - star cases , we present 1d profiles of gas density and metallicity in figure  [ flms_1d_metal ] .",
    "the strong sn blast waves in all cases substantially suppress the gas density in the host halo , resulting in @xmath143 , similar to that of the background igm at this redshift of @xmath144 .",
    "the extent of the central void is about @xmath145 for the ccsn case ( s15 ) , and @xmath146 for the hn cases , respectively .",
    "the metallicity profiles for the hn cases are quite similar , but the s30 model enriches the igm out to a slightly larger radius in response to its higher blast wave velocity .",
    "finally , instead of sn explosions , the stars may directly collapse into a bh , a possibility which becomes increasingly likely with increasing progenitor mass .",
    "for such a bh fate , the relic h  ii regions would quickly begin to cool to about @xmath147 , and recombination would suppress the abundance of free electrons .",
    "we now discuss the sn feedback from binary stars . to enable a meaningful comparison , we fix the total mass in pop  iii stars , here @xmath0 , either locked up in a single star or distributed among binary partners ( s30+s30 or s45+s15 ) .",
    "the key question then is whether there are significant differences or not .",
    "stellar evolution models strongly suggest that @xmath148 pop  iii stars are likely to die as bhs , possibly accompanied by very weak sn explosions .",
    "hence , we also consider the case of a @xmath0 star dying as such a weak sn with an explosion energy of @xmath149b and a metal yield of @xmath150 , due to strong fallback during the bh - forming explosion .",
    "the basic trends can be gleaned from figure  [ fbn_metal ] and figure  [ fbn_1d_metal ] . as long as at least one component explodes as a hn",
    ", the resulting metal enrichment is very similar .",
    "however , the enrichment from the binary systems is more robust , in the sense that the single s60 star is likely to experience only a weak explosion accompanied by much reduced heavy element production and dispersal .",
    "thus , the recent revision of the pop  iii star formation paradigm away from a single - star outcome to ubiquitous binarity in effect enhances chemical feedback in the early universe .",
    "one particularly interesting variant of the s45+s15 model is the presence of long - lived x - ray feedback . because of the uncertainty in the stellar evolution model",
    ", the @xmath2 star can possibly collapse into a bh instead of blowing up as a sn . in the case of a close binary , mass transfer from the @xmath3 companion , still alive at this time , becomes possible .",
    "mass accretion onto the compact object can efficiently extract the gravitational energy of the infalling material , converting it into the thermal energy within the accretion disk that leads to x - ray emission .",
    "unlike the ionizing photons from stars , the x - rays can more easily penetrate the igm because of the much reduced opacity at high energies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ", we assume a constant accretion rate onto the central bh of about @xmath151 , which lasts for about 10 million years . for simplicity",
    ", we further assume that the @xmath3 companion star eventually dies as a white dwarf without a sn explosion , and neglect its uv radiation during the accretion phase .",
    "we show the impact of such a pop  iii x - ray binary , comparing it with the non x - ray case , in figure  [ fbn_xray ] . in the absence of x - ray emission ,",
    "the temperature of the the relic h  ii region quickly declines and the ionized hydrogen recombines .",
    "an active x - ray binary , on the other hand , provides a prolonged heating source , maintaining the temperature and ionization inside the relic h  ii region , and further heating up the gas beyond its boundary , up to several hundred kelvin .",
    "more importantly , the x - ray emission can change the free electron fraction in the igm which is critical for h@xmath71 formation . because the igm is optically thin to x - ray photons , the resulting heating is quite homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "we also find that the x - ray photons may penetrate the gas of nearby halos , thus affecting their star formation properties .",
    "we have presented the results from cosmological simulations of the impact of pop  iii stars , specifically focusing on the new effects arising from the presence of binaries .",
    "we improve on earlier simulations by using updated pop  iii stellar models . in ascertaining the cosmological impact of the first binaries , we consider their radiative , sn , and x - ray feedback . by comparing a single @xmath0 star and the corresponding binary systems with equal total mass",
    ", we find that the resulting numbers of hydrogen - ionizing photons are very similar . however , for he@xmath92 ionizing radiation , the binary stars are significantly weaker than the single star , because the more energetic uv photon production is strongly reduced in the less massive stars . if binary stars thus were the typical outcome of pop  iii star formation in minihalos , detection of the distinct emission lines from he@xmath93 recombination , most prominently the 1640 @xmath5 line , would be very challenging . because the x - ray feedback strongly depends on the spectrum of x - ray binaries which is uncertain in the high redshifts , its observational signature is more difficult to predict .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite suggested that the x - ray feedback of the pop iii binaries can be examined by the 21 cm observations .",
    "we here explore cases where the stars die as core - collapse sne or as hypernovae . in all cases ,",
    "the mechanical feedback from the explosions expels the gas from the host systems , thus suppressing any subsequent star formation in the same halo , at least for of order 10myr . to trigger any further star formation , the expelled gas needs to be driven back to high density , possibly as a result of halo mergers within bottom - up structure formation later on . for a @xmath3 star ,",
    "the expected final fate is a core - collapse sn , whereas the fate of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 pop  iii stars is still poorly understood . to bracket parameter space",
    ", we here assume that they die as energetic hypernovae , weak sne , or directly collapse into bhs .",
    "it is evident that for such more massive progenitors , chemical feedback can span a broad range of possibilities .",
    "the most effective feedback is provided by the hypernova models , where the nearby igm is typically enriched to average metallicities of @xmath152 , out to @xmath7 .",
    "even single , energetic sne can impact the early universe on cosmological scales .",
    "we demonstrate this in figure  [ impacts_den_temp ] , showing the feedback from a single @xmath0 star , undergoing a hn explosion .",
    "the resulting feedback significantly enhances the igm temperature , smoothes out density structures in nearby halos , and enriches the primordial gas over regions of @xmath7 .",
    "however , the formation of a single massive star inside a minihalo increases the probability of collapsing into a bh without any chemical enrichment . on the other hand",
    ", binary star formation greatly buttresses the likelihood that metal enrichment will occur . in effect ,",
    "binary formation is much less likely to keep the early universe metal free , with consequences for the prompt transition in star formation mode to the low - mass dominated population  ii .",
    "realistic binary stellar models could introduce a very rich phenomenology of evolutionary pathways . among them are ejection scenarios , where one component is flung out , such that it may explode in the outskirts of its host halo , as opposed to the location of its birth , as implicitly assumed here .",
    "there is also rich physics related to the early evolution of the sn remnant , when shock break - out occurs , and hydrodynamical mixing takes place .",
    "all of these intriguing aspects of binary progenitors will be explored in future simulations , with greatly improved spatial and temporal resolution .",
    "the exploratory models presented here , however , already clearly indicate the importance of studying binary - related feedback in the early universe .",
    "the imprint from the violent death of pop  iii stars , in all its variety , might soon be amenable to empirical testing with the _ james webb space telescope ( jwst ) _ , to be launched around 2018 .",
