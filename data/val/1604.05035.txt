    "detection of the gravitational waves ( gws ) is one of the most promising tools to probe the early universe as well as astrophysical dynamics .",
    "possible gw sources in the early universe include for example inflationary quantum fluctuations  @xcite , preheating  @xcite , cosmic strings  @xcite and cosmic phase transitions  @xcite . especially , the last possibility has been extensively studied in the context of the electroweak transition triggered by the standard model ( sm ) higgs field . though the electroweak transition within the sm was found to be too weak to produce an observable amplitude of gws  @xcite ,",
    "various extensions of the sm predict first order phase transitions with a large amplitude of gws  @xcite .    in considering physics beyond the sm",
    ", the higgs sector may provide us some important clue .",
    "especially , the smallness of the electroweak scale , compared to the planck scale or grand unification scale ( if it is realized in nature ) , has long been considered as unnatural , and puzzled people as  naturalness problem \" or more specifically  gauge hierarchy problem \" .",
    "one of the most popular ways to solve this problem is to impose supersymmetry ( susy ) on the theory .",
    "this additional symmetry introduces so - called superpartners with opposite statistics to each particle content in the sm , and the higgs mass is protected from the quadratic divergence because of the cancellation with bosonic and fermionic loops .",
    "as long as the soft - breaking scale of susy is close to the electroweak scale , this provides a convincing solution to the naturalness problem .",
    "however , despite all the efforts made by the high - energy community , the current data at large hadron collider ( lhc ) suggest no traces of superpartners . therefore , while susy remains to be an attractive solution to the naturalness problem , this situation leads us to look for other possibilities .    here",
    "let us recall the argument by bardeen  @xcite that the sm itself has no gauge hierarchy problem as long as we consider perturbative region .",
    "this is because the sm has an approximate scale symmetry which is broken only logarithmically , and therefore the seemingly quadratic dependence on the cutoff regulator @xmath5 must be canceled out in the higgs mass .",
    "no fine - tuning is required in this cancellation , because it is protected from this quadratic divergence by the approximate scale symmetry .",
    "the gauge hierarchy problem appears only when nonperturbative effects such as landau pole appear , or when we consider some uv completion of the theory . whether the higgs mass is protected by the approximate scale symmetry when we take these into account",
    "depends on the formulation of the theory in the uv .    given this",
    ", it might be interesting to consider the possibility that the uv completion is such that it leaves no tree masses in its low energy effective action , rather than leaving a small portion as the ew scale .",
    "in such cases , all the mass scales must be generated by dimensional transmutation such as coleman - weinberg mechanism  @xcite .",
    "though it was found that this mechanism can not be applied directly to the sm higgs sector since the predicted higgs mass @xmath6 gev is experimentally excluded , phenomenologically viable models still exist if one includes an additional scalar to the model so that the mass scale comes from the breaking of the conformal invariance of that field  @xcite ( see also @xcite for @xcite ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , meissner and nicoli called the property free from tree - level masses ( though somewhat misleading )  classically conformal \" .    in this paper , we study the cosmological history of the classically conformal @xmath0 model proposed in refs .",
    "especially we are interested in gw production during the phase transition of the @xmath0 breaking field .",
    "as we see later , the  classical conformal \" property is the key to the large energy density released during the phase transition and the resulting large amplitude of gws , and these features are considered to be shared in many classical conformal models . since now ground - based detectors such as kagra  @xcite , virgo  @xcite and advanced ligo  @xcite are in operation , and space interferometer experiments elisa  @xcite , big - bang observer ( bbo )  @xcite and deci - hertz interferometer observatory ( decigo )  @xcite have been proposed , it would be interesting to study the gw production in these classically conformal models .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_setup ] we first write down the model and see its finite - temperature behavior .",
    "then in sec .",
    "[ sec_history ] we study the cosmic history it follows . since gw production occurs at the time of phase transition , we elaborate the criteria for the transition in this section . in sec .",
    "[ sec_gw ] we discuss gw production in this model and study the detectability of these gws by future interferometer experiments .",
    "we summarize in sec .",
    "[ sec_conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we first write down the setup of the model , and then see the finite - temperature behavior of the effective potential .      the minimal @xmath0 extension of the standard model with classical conformal symmetry , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , is based on the argument that once the classical conformal invariance and its violation by quantum anomalies are imposed on sm , the model becomes free from the gauge hierarchy problem  @xcite .",
    "this model has the gauge symmetry su@xmath7su@xmath8u@xmath9u@xmath1 , and introduces three generations of right handed neutrinos @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "in addition , it contains a complex scalar field @xmath12 , in order to break the u@xmath1 gauge symmetry by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) and to induce the masses of right handed neutrinos .",
    "the matter contents of the model are listed in table  [ table_matcon ] .",
    ".matter contents of the classically conformal @xmath0 model .",
    "in addition to the standard model matters , three generations of right - handed neutrinos @xmath10 and a @xmath0 charged complex scalar field @xmath12 are introduced . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     ) is satisfied .",

    "in this paper , we have studied the cosmological histories realized in the classically conformal @xmath0 gauge extension of the standard model , and discussed the possibility of probing it using gravitational waves . because of the classical conformal invariance of the model , the thermal trap persists at the origin of the effective potential .",
    "this makes the ultra - supercooling @xmath14 possible , where @xmath15 is the typical symmetry breaking scale .",
    "in addition , the dependence of the nucleation rate to the temperature is suppressed because of the classical conformal invariance , which makes the bubbles produced in the transition and the resulting gw amplitude larger . as a result , requiring ( 1 )",
    "u@xmath1 is broken after the reheating , ( 2 ) the @xmath0 gauge coupling does not blow up below the planck scale , ( 3 ) the thermal phase transition completes , the gravitational wave amplitude can be as large as @xmath2 for some model parameters , and a vast parameter region can be tested by future interferometer experiments . at the same time , our result of the large amount of gw production is supposed to hold for other classically conformal models .",
    "rj and mt are thankful to k.  nakayama for comments and discussions on the manuscript .",
    "both authors are also grateful to k.  kohri , who gave helpful comments to improve the manuscript .",
    "they also appreciate the discussion with s. iso .",
    "the work of rj and mt is supported by jsps research fellowships for young scientists .",
    "in this appendix we discuss the fate of the false vacuum region which exists with a finite volume even when the condition for the thermal phase transition ( [ eq_ic ] ) is satisfied .",
    "the reason for the existence of the false vacuum region is that , due to the behavior of the nucleation rate @xmath16 , or its exponent @xmath17 , a spacial point in the false vacuum is less and less likely to experience the transition after @xmath17 hits the minimum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_st ] ) . in such regions",
    "@xmath18 continues to be trapped at the origin of the effective potential , until it comes out by the de sitter quantum fluctuations after the universe cools down to @xmath19 . even though such false vacuum region is very rare",
    ", we must take into account the exponential expansion of that region .",
    "especially , the cosmological history realized in the present model significantly depends on whether eternal inflation occurs or not .",
    "eternal inflation occurs when de sitter fluctuation dominates over the classical motion of the field , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the amount of @xmath18 motion during one hubble time , and the labels @xmath22 and @xmath23 stand for quantum and classical , respectively .",
    "evaluating at @xmath24 , one has @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the value of @xmath27 at @xmath28 . because @xmath29 in the parameter region shown in sec .",
    "[ sec_results ] , eternal inflation occurs in the false vacuum .",
    "( the effective potential can be approximated by the hilltop inflation type around the origin , in which case the condition for the eternal inflation is studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) in those patches where @xmath18 starts classical rolling towards the true vacuum , no observers are expected to exist . however , some patches of the universe where the inflation finishes may produce observers with a quite small but finite probability .",
    "( of course , even if the inflation ends in one hubble patch , the isotropic and homogeneous cmb spectrum with @xmath30-folding @xmath31@xmath32 can not be realized in that single patch .",
    "however , there seems to exist a tiny probability with which a large number of hubble patches experience the transition at the same time and observers are born inside . ) because eternal inflation produces infinite number of such patches , typical observers realized in this model may find themselves not in the patch where the thermal phase transition is successfully completed , but in the one which experienced an inflating phase at @xmath33 and then happened to escape .",
    "if one finds this situation problematic , the setup can be modified so that a typical observer lives in the patch where the thermal phase transition is completed .",
    "one way of doing this is to modify the potential so that the phase transition is completed at all the spacial points , which is realized for example by introducing a nonminimal coupling @xmath34 with a negative coefficient of @xmath35 or larger , which induces a negative mass squared @xmath36 at the origin of the potential and makes @xmath18 roll down to the symmetry breaking minimum at all the spacial points . forbidding the production of some inevitable components such as baryon asymmetry or dark matter in the patches where the phase transition occurs after the eternal inflation phase may be another solution .",
