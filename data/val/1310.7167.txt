    "scalar fields are assumed to play a fundamental role in cosmology , where one of the first major mechanisms for which scalar fields are thought to be responsible is the inflationary scenario @xcite . although originally inflationary models were proposed in cosmology to provide solutions to the issues of the singularity , flat space , horizon , homogeneity problems and absence of magnetic monopoles , as well as to the problem of large numbers of particles @xcite ,",
    "by far the most useful property of inflation is that it generates both density perturbations and gravitational waves .",
    "these can be measured in a variety of different ways including the analysis of microwave background anisotropies , velocity flows in the universe , clustering of galaxies and the abundance of gravitationally bound objects of various types @xcite .",
    "the possibility that a canonical scalar field with a potential , dubbed _ quintessence _ , may be responsible for the late - time cosmic acceleration , was also explored @xcite .",
    "contrary to the cosmological constant , the quintessence equation of state changes dynamically with time @xcite .",
    "in fact , a plethora of exotic fluids have been proposed to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe , which include amongst many others @xmath2essence models , in which the late - time can be driven by the kinetic energy of the scalar field @xcite ; coupled models where dark energy interacts with dark matter @xcite ; and unified models of dark matter and dark energy @xcite .    in a wide range of inflationary models",
    "the underlying dynamics is that of a single scalar field , with the inflaton rolling in some underlying potential @xcite . in order to study the inflationary dynamics",
    ", the usual strategy is an expansion in the deviation from the scale invariance , formally expressed as the slow - roll approximation , which arises in two separate contexts .",
    "the first is in simplifying the classical inflationary dynamics of expansion and the lowest order approximation ignores the contribution of the kinetic energy of the inflation to the expansion rate .",
    "the second is in the calculation of the perturbation spectra , where the standard expressions are valid to lower order in the slow roll approximation @xcite .",
    "exact inflationary solutions have also been found for a large number of inflationary potentials , and the respective potentials allowing a graceful exit have been classified @xcite .",
    "in fact , many quintessential potentials have been proposed in the literature , which may be crudely classified as `` freezing '' models and `` thawing '' models caldwell:2005tm .",
    "note that in the former class @xcite , the field rolls along the potential in the past , and the movement gradually slowing down as the system enters the phase of cosmic acceleration . in the latter ,",
    "`` thawing '' models , the scalar field , possessing a mass of @xmath3 , has been frozen by the hubble friction term @xmath4 until recently , and eventually starts to evolve as @xmath5 drops below @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "another interesting model involves a double exponential potential , which requires that the potential becomes shallow , or has a minimum in order to slow the movement of the scalar field @xcite ; the latter behavior has also been exhibited by more general potentials general_pot .",
    "more recently , the released planck data of the 2.7 full sky survey p1,p2 have shown a number of novel and unexpected features , whose explanation will certainly require a deep change in our standard understanding of the universe .",
    "these recent observations have measured the cosmic microwave background to an unprecedented precision .",
    "even though generally the planck data confirm the foundations of the @xmath6cdm model , the observational data show some tension between the fundamental principle of the model and observations .",
    "for example , the planck data combined with the wmap polarization data show that the index of the power spectrum is given by @xmath7 @xcite , which rules out the exact scale - invariance ( @xmath8 ) at more than @xmath9 level . hence planck data `` severely limits the extensions of the simplest paradigm '' p1 . on the other hand planck data",
    "do not require the consideration of inflationary models beyond the simplest canonical single field scenarios @xcite .",
    "more specifically , a chaotic inflationary model , based on a quartic potential , is highly disfavored by the observations . the inflationary model based on a quadratic potential is marginally consistent with the observation at 2@xmath10 level , and models with a linear or fractional power potential lie outside the 1@xmath10 , but within the 2@xmath11 allowed region @xcite .",
    "the observations of high redshift supernovae , and the wmap / planck data , showing that the location of the first acoustic peak in the power spectrum of the microwave background radiation is consistent with the inflationary prediction @xmath12 , have provided compelling evidence for a net equation of state of the cosmic fluid lying in the range @xmath13 acc .",
    "to explain these observations , two dark components are invoked : pressureless cold dark matter ( cdm ) , and dark energy ( de ) with negative pressure .",
    "cdm contributes @xmath14 @xcite , and is mainly motivated by the theoretical interpretation of the galactic rotation curves and large scale structure formation .",
    "de is assumed to provide @xmath15 , and is responsible for the acceleration of the distant type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "there are a huge number of proposed candidates for de ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "one possibility is cosmologies based on a mixture of cold dark matter and quintessence , a slowly - varying , spatially inhomogeneous component @xcite .",
    "an example of implementation of the idea of quintessence is the suggestion that it is the energy associated with a scalar field @xmath16 , with a self - interaction potential @xmath17 .",
    "if the potential energy density is greater than the kinetic one , then the pressure @xmath18 associated to the @xmath16-field is negative .",
    "quintessential cosmological models have been intensively investigated in the physical literature ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "the interaction between dark energy and dark matter in the framework of irreversible thermodynamics of open systems with matter creation / annihilation has also been recently explored @xcite , where dark energy and dark matter are considered as an interacting two component ( scalar field and `` ordinary '' dark matter ) cosmological fluid in a homogeneous spatially flat and isotropic friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe .",
    "the possibility of cosmological anisotropy from non - comoving dark matter and dark energy have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "models with nonstandard scalar fields , such as phantom scalar fields and galileons , which can have bounce solutions and dark energy solutions with @xmath19 have also been extensively investigated in the literature . in the galileon theory",
    "one imposes an internal galilean invariance , under which the gradient of the relativistic scalar field @xmath20 , with peculiar derivative self - interactions , and universally coupled to matter , is shifted by a constant term @xcite .",
    "the galilean symmetry constrains the structure of the lagrangian of the scalar field so that in four dimensions only five terms that can yield sizable non - linearities without introducing ghosts do exist .",
    "different extensions of the galileon models were considered in @xcite . in gal3 a new class of inflationary models was proposed , in which the standard model higgs boson can act as an inflaton due to galileon - like non - linear derivative interaction .",
    "the generated primordial density perturbation is consistent with the present observational data .",
    "generalized galileons as a framework to develop the most general single - field inflation models , i.e. , generalized g - inflation , were studied in @xcite . as special cases",
    "this model contains k - inflation , extended inflation , and new higgs inflation .",
    "the background and perturbation evolution in this model were investigated , and the most general quadratic actions for tensor and scalar cosmological perturbations was obtained . the stability criteria and the power spectra of primordial fluctuations were also presented .",
    "for a recent review of scalar field theories with second - derivative lagrangians , whose field equations are second order see @xcite .",
    "some of these theories admit solutions violating the null energy condition and have no obvious pathologies .    in order to explain the recent acceleration of the universe , in which @xmath21 , scalar fields @xmath0",
    "that are minimally coupled to gravity with a negative kinetic energy , and which are known as `` phantom fields '' , have been introduced in @xcite .",
    "the energy density and pressure of a phantom scalar field are given by @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the properties of phantom cosmological models have been investigated in phan2 .",
    "the phenomenon of the phantom divide line crossing in the scalar field models with cusped potentials was considered in @xcite .",
    "cosmological observations show that at some moment in the past the value of the parameter @xmath24 of the dark energy equation of state may have crossed the value @xmath25 , corresponding to the cosmological constant @xmath6 .",
    "this phenomenon is called phantom divide line crossing @xcite .",
    "non - phantom dark energy is described by a minimally coupled scalar field , having a kinetic term with the positive sign .",
    "therefore in order to describe the phantom divide line crossing it seems natural to use two scalar fields , a phantom field with the negative kinetic term , and a standard one @xcite .",
    "another possible way of explaining the phantom divide line crossing is to use a scalar field nonminimally coupled to gravity @xcite .",
    "the mathematical properties of the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmological models with a scalar field as matter source have also been intensively investigated . in @xcite",
    "a simple way of reducing the system of the gravitational field equations to one first order equation was proposed , namely , to the hamilton - jacobi - like equation for the hubble parameter @xmath5considered as a function of the scalar field @xmath0 , @xmath26 .",
    "the gravitational collapse and the dynamical properties of scalar field models were considered in @xcite .",
    "the solution of the field equations for a cosine hyperbolic type scalar field potential for the case of an equation of state equivalent to the nonrelativistic matter plus a cosmological term was derived in @xcite .",
    "the relation between the inflationary potential and the spectra of density ( scalar ) perturbations and gravitational waves ( tensor perturbations ) produced during inflation , and the possibility of reconstructing the inflaton potential from observations , was considered in @xcite .",
    "if inflation passes a consistency test , one can use observational information to constrain the inflationary potential .",
    "the key point in the reconstruction procedure is that the hubble parameter is considered as a function of the scalar field , and this allows to reconstruct the scalar field potential , and determine the dynamics of the field itself , without a priori knowing the hubble parameter as a function of time or of the scale factor @xcite .",
    "general solutions for flat friedmann universes filled with a scalar field in induced gravity models and models including the hilbert - einstein curvature term plus a scalar field conformally coupled to gravity were also derived in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding models are connected with minimally coupled solutions through the combination of a conformal transformation and a transformation of the scalar field .",
    "the explicit forms of the self - interaction potentials for six exactly solvable models was also obtained . in @xcite ,",
    "a phase - plane analysis was performed of the complete dynamical system corresponding to a flat frw cosmological models with a perfect fluid and a self - interacting scalar field and it was shown that every positive and monotonous potential which is asymptotically exponential yields a scaling solution as a global attractor .",
    "the dynamics of models of warm inflation with general dissipative effects , was also extensively analyzed mimoso:2005bv , and a mechanism that generates the exact solutions of scalar field cosmologies in a unified way was also investigated .",
    "the connections between the korteweg - de vries equation and inflationary cosmological models were explored in @xcite .",
    "the relation between the non - linear schrdinger equation and the cosmological friedmann equations for a spatially flat and isotropic universe in the presence of a self - interacting scalar field has been considered in @xcite .",
    "a hamiltonian formalism for the study of scalar fields coupled to gravity in a cosmological background was developed in @xcite . a number of integrable one  scalar spatially flat cosmologies , which play a natural role in the inflationary scenarios , were studied in @xcite .",
    "systems with potentials involving combinations of exponential functions , and similar non ",
    "integrable cases were also studied in detail .",
    "it was shown that the scalar field emerges from the initial singularity while climbing up sufficiently steep exponential potentials ( `` climbing phenomenon '' ) , and that it inevitably collapses in a big crunch , whenever the scalar field tries to settle at the negative extremals of the potential .",
    "the question whether the integrable one scalar - field cosmologies can be embedded as consistent one - field truncations into extended gauged supergravity or in @xmath27supergravity gauged by a superpotential without the use of @xmath28terms was considered in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the theoretical investigation of scalar field models is an essential task in cosmology .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to consider a systematic analysis of scalar field cosmologies , and to derive a basic evolution equation describing flat , isotropic and homogeneous scalar field cosmological models .",
    "the evolution equation is a first order , strongly non - linear differential equation , which , however , allows the possibility of considering analytical solutions in both the asymptotic limits of scalar field kinetic or potential energy dominance and in the intermediate domain , respectively .",
    "moreover , a large number of exact solutions can also be obtained .",
    "the cases of the exponential , hyperbolic cosine , and power law potentials are explicitly considered .",

    "<S> the mechanism of the initial inflationary scenario of the universe and of its late - time acceleration can be described by assuming the existence of some gravitationally coupled scalar fields @xmath0 , with the inflaton field generating inflation and the quintessence field being responsible for the late accelerated expansion . </S>",
    "<S> various inflationary and late - time accelerated scenarios are distinguished by the choice of an effective self - interaction potential @xmath1 , which simulates a temporarily non - vanishing cosmological term . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we present a new formalism for the analysis of scalar fields in flat isotropic and homogeneous cosmological models . </S>",
    "<S> the basic evolution equation of the models can be reduced to a first order non - linear differential equation . </S>",
    "<S> approximate solutions of this equation can be constructed in the limiting cases of the scalar field kinetic energy and potential energy dominance , respectively , as well as in the intermediate regime . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we present several new accelerating and decelerating exact cosmological solutions , based on the exact integration of the basic evolution equation for scalar field cosmologies . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , exact solutions are obtained for exponential , generalized cosine hyperbolic , and power law potentials , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> cosmological models with power law scalar field potentials are also analyzed in detail . </S>"
