    "the geometric nature of the thermodynamics has been considered as an important question since the pioneering works of gibbs @xcite and caratheodory @xcite . however , it was the development of differential geometry and einstein s theory of general relativity which increased the interest to extend and develop the geometric approach to other branches of physics . particularly , in thermodynamics ,",
    "the work of hermann and mrugala @xcite set up the manifold called _ thermodynamic phase space _",
    ", where the `` contact geometry '' approached by gibbs and caratheodory becomes meaningful .",
    "riemannian geometry was first introduced in the _ space of equilibrium states _ by rao @xcite , in 1945 , by means of a metric whose components in local coordinates coincide with fisher s information matrix . in fact , the fisher - rao metric can be considered as an element of the class of so - called hessian metrics whose local components coincide with the hessian of any arbitrarily chosen thermodynamic potential .",
    "rao s original work has been followed up and extended by a number of authors ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the proposal coined by quevedo @xcite as geometrothermodynamics ( gtd ) was essential to unify both approaches and to endow the equilibrium states manifold with a legendre invariant metric .",
    "the importance of legendre invariance lies in the thermodynamics itself , meaning that once a representation is chosen to describe the system ( for instance , the internal energy or entropy ) , its legendre transform ( e.g. , the gibbs free energy or the massieu - planck potential ) contains the same information as the original representation .",
    "therefore , legendre invariance should be an essential ingredient of a geometric construction .",
    "basically , in the gtd approach , the thermodynamic phase space is endowed with a legendre invariant metric , and its maximally integral submanifold , that inherits its metric structure , is identified with the space of equilibrium states .",
    "in essence , a point of this space corresponds to an equilibrium state and , therefore , the thermodynamic processes take place in the equilibrium manifold . consequently",
    ", one expects the geometric properties of the equilibrium manifold to be related to the macroscopic physical properties .",
    "the details of this relation can be summarized in three points :    * the curvature of the equilibrium manifold reflects the thermodynamical interaction . *",
    "the phase transitions correspond to curvature singularities .",
    "* there exists a correspondence between quasi - static thermodynamic processes and certain geodesics of the equilibrium manifold .",
    "the geometrothermodynamic approach has been applied to classical systems such as the ideal gas @xcite and the van der waals gas @xcite , to more exotic systems such as black holes @xcite , and also in the context of relativistic cosmology to describe the evolution of our universe @xcite . in all the cases ,",
    "in which the analysis have been performed completely , the summarized items have been confirmed and the results have been shown to be legendre invariant .    in this paper , we aim to describe the geometry behind a chemical reaction .",
    "first , we will consider the case of a reaction with only two species , and then we will show that results can be generalized to include any arbitrary finite number of species .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ theory ] , we present a review of the geometrothermodynamic structures and the classical thermodynamics approach to chemical reactions ; particularly , we analyze the reaction in the context of classical thermodynamics . in sections [ sec : ig ] and [ sec :",
    "vdw ] , we consider the case of a reaction with two species corresponding to ideal gases and van der waals gases , respectively . in both cases , we present the thermodynamic analysis of the reaction to find the final state of equilibrium , and analyze the same situation from the point of view of gtd .",
    "it is shown that each reaction can be represented by a geodesic in the equilibrium manifold .",
    "then , in section [ sec : gtdcr ] , we show the applicability of gtd to a general chemical reaction .",
    "finally , section [ sec : con ] is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "the idea behind the geometrization of a thermodynamic system is simple : to build a space where each point corresponds to an equilibrium state .",
    "the physics behind the equilibrium thermodynamics allows us to say that this space is an @xmath1-dimensional manifold with the dimension corresponding to the number of thermodynamic degrees of freedom of the system . in consequence",
    ", one needs only @xmath1 independent variables to coordinatize the manifold .    in standard equilibrium thermodynamics , to a system with @xmath1 degrees of freedom",
    "it is possible to associate @xmath1 extensive variables @xmath2 , @xmath1 intensive variables @xmath3 , where the index @xmath4 runs from 1 to @xmath1 , and a thermodynamic potential @xmath5 , relating them . in this context , the terms extensive and intensive are general concepts that refer to the independence or dependency of the variables associated to a given potential . for example , for a closed simple system with two degrees of freedom , the independent variables are @xmath6 and @xmath7 , if the potential chosen to describe the system is @xmath8 , or @xmath9 and @xmath10 , if the fundamental potential is @xmath11 .",
    "recall that @xmath12 .",
    "consequently , from the point of view of thermodynamics , to a system with @xmath1 degrees of freedom we associate @xmath13 variables , @xmath1 of them being independent .",
    "geometrically , this idea corresponds to an embedding @xmath14 of an @xmath1-dimensional manifold @xmath15 into a @xmath16-dimensional manifold @xmath17 given by [ gtd.emb ] : , or , in coordinates , : \\{e^a } \\{(e^a),i^b(e^a),e^a }  , where @xmath18 also goes from @xmath19 to @xmath1 .",
    "the manifold @xmath17 is a contact manifold @xcite .",
    "this means that @xmath20 is endowed with a family of tangent hyperplanes ( contact structure ) defined by the so - called fundamental 1-form @xmath21 that satisfies the non - integrability condition [ gtd.ni ] ( ) ^n 0  .",
    "the manifold @xmath17 is called the _ thermoynamic phase space_. it can be coordinatized by the @xmath13 variables @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "its existence is relevant because it results adequate to perform legendre transformations ( as in thermodynamics ) as a change of coordinates .",
    "formally , a legendre transformation is a contact transformation , i.e. , a transformation which leaves the contact structure unchanged ; in coordinates @xmath24 , it is defined as @xcite @xmath25 = - _ kl ^k^l , e^i = -^i , e^j = ^j ,   i^i = ^i ,  i^j = ^j  , where @xmath26 is any disjoint decomposition of the set of indices @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "according to the darboux theorem @xcite , the 1-form @xmath21 of equation can be given in the coordinates @xmath24 as : [ gtd.local ] = - i_a e^a where we use einstein s summation convention for repeated indices .",
    "it can easily be seen that after a legendre transformation , the new 1-form @xmath29 in coordinates @xmath30 reads [ gtdlegendre ] = - _ a ^a  .",
    "this proves that the contact structure remains unchanged .",
    "on other hand , the manifold @xmath15 is the maximally integral submanifold of @xmath17 , and is defined in such a way that the properties of the thermodynamic systems are encoded in it .",
    "so far , we have seen that @xmath15 is specified through the embedding , which is equivalent to specifying the fundamental equation of the system @xmath31 .",
    "the next step is to introduce the relations of standard equilibrium thermodynamics into the definition of the manifold . to this end",
    ", we demand that the embedding satisfies the condition [ gtd.01 ] ^ * ( ) = 0  , where @xmath32 is the pullback of @xmath14 . in coordinates",
    ", it takes the form [ gtd.02 ] ^ * ( ) = ^*(- i_a e^a ) = ( - i_a)e^a = 0 .",
    "it follows immediately that [ gtd.03 ] = ( e^a ) = i_a  .",
    "equations and constitute the standard gibbs relations of equilibrium thermodynamics in @xmath15 , namely , = i_a e^a  .",
    "the manifold @xmath15 defined in this way is called the _ space of equilibrium states_.    in addition to the geometric description of thermodynamics in terms of a contact structure , the gtd program promotes the contact manifold @xmath33 into a riemannian contact manifold @xmath34 , where @xmath8 is a metric sharing the symmetries of @xmath21 .",
    "the most general metric invariant under total and partial legendre transformations that has been found so far is given by @xcite [ quevedogiii ] g = + ( z^a ) _",
    "a=1^n , where @xmath35 is an arbitrary legendre invariant function of the coordinates @xmath36 and @xmath37 is an integer .",
    "the corresponding induced metric in the space of equilibrium states is given by @xmath38\\ .\\ ] ] as suggested in @xcite , this metric could be useful to analyze multicomponent systems , particularly systems where chemical reactions take place .",
    "we will show in the next sections that , in fact , chemical reactions can be represented as geodesics of the equilibrium manifold described by the metric ( [ quevedogii ] ) .",
    "notice that to compute the explicit components of this metric , it is necessary to specify only the fundamental equation @xmath39 .",
    "thus , all the geometric properties of the equilibrium space are determined by the fundamental equation .",
    "this is similar to the situation in classical thermodynamics where the fundamental equation is used to determine all the equations of state and thermodynamic properties of the system .",
    "notice that the metric @xmath8 contains the arbitrary parameter @xmath37 which , however , can be absorbed by renaming the coordinates as @xmath40 and @xmath41 . then , [ giiixy ] g = + ( z^a ) _ a=1^n ( x^a y_a )  .",
    "furthermore , the arbitrary function @xmath35 can be fixed by demanding invariance with respect to changes of representation , an issue which is outside of the scope of the present work @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible to perform the entire analysis with an arbitrary function @xmath35 in coordinates @xmath42 ; however , the physical interpretation of these coordinates becomes cumbersome and makes it difficult the physical interpretation of the results . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we will use in this work the particular choice @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which has been shown to be useful also to describe geometrically systems like the ideal gas or van der waals gas @xcite . then , in the particular case @xmath45 , the metric of the equilibrium manifold reduces to @xmath46 \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial e^1",
    "\\partial e^2 } d e^1   \\otimes d e^2 \\ . \\label{metrica}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to analyze the geometric properties of the equilibrium manifold , we will consider the connection and the curvature .",
    "in particular , the connection is used to represent the geodesic equations in a given coordinate system + ^a _  bc = 0  , ^a _  bc = g^ad ( + - ) where @xmath47 are the christoffel symbols .",
    "the solutions of these equations are the geodesics @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is an affine parameter along the trajectory .",
    "one of the main goals of the present work is to show that a given chemical reaction can be represented geometrically as a family of geodesics of the equilibrium manifold , which is determined by the fundamental equation of the chemical system .",
    "the curvature tensor is defined as [ curvature ] r^a _  bcd = - + ^a _  e c^e _  bd - ^a _  e d^e _  bc  . in gtd , the curvature tensor of the equilibrium manifold is expected to be a measure of the interaction between the components of the thermodynamic system .",
    "furthermore , from the curvature tensor one can define the ricci tensor @xmath50 and the curvature scalar @xmath51 .",
    "notice that in the case of a two - dimensional space , the curvature tensor has only one independent component , say @xmath52 and , therefore , the ricci tensor and the curvature scalar are proportional to @xmath52 .",
    "consider the general chemical reaction  , [ cr ] in which the @xmath53 are the stoichiometric numbers of the reactants @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are the stoichiometric coefficients of the products @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "notice that the species need not all to occur in the same phase .",
    "the main condition for the chemical - reaction equilibrium in a closed system is that @xcite [ equilib ] _ i _ i_i = 0  , where the coefficients @xmath57 refer to the stoichiometric numbers and @xmath58 represents the chemical potential of the @xmath59species .",
    "notice that the condition ( [ equilib ] ) holds no matter how the closed system reaches its final equilibrium state . during a reaction , the change of numbers of moles of the species @xmath60 , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the number of moles of species @xmath60 at the beginning of the reaction , is proportional to the stoichiometric number @xmath63 with the extent of reaction @xmath64 as the proportionality factor , @xmath65 . for an infinitesimal extent of reaction @xmath66",
    ", it holds that @xmath67 .",
    "the fact that the extent of reaction can be treated as an infinitesimal quantity is essential for the geometric description we will present below .",
    "the main premise to apply classical thermodynamics in closed systems , where chemical reactions can occur , is that we can use thermodynamic variables to describe the system even if it is not in material equilibrium .",
    "it means that variables such as @xmath9 , @xmath11 , @xmath6 , @xmath10 , etc .",
    ", are completely defined at any extent of reaction .    though is useful for practical situations",
    ", it does not contain information about the behavior of the different thermodynamic potentials from initial conditions to equilibrium . to obtain this information",
    ", we will use the fundamental equation of the chemical system .",
    "let @xmath68 represents the fundamental equation of the species @xmath69 .",
    "then , the fundamental equation for the general reaction ( [ cr ] ) can be constructed as follows @xmath70 notice that in this expression we are taking into account all possible interactions between all the species .",
    "the only assumption is that the interaction between the species @xmath69 and @xmath71 depends on the variables @xmath72 and @xmath73 , only .",
    "it seems that this condition is not very restrictive in realistic situations .    in the last subsection",
    ", we emphasized the role of the legendre transformations from the geometrical point of view .",
    "now , we will mention their importance from the thermodynamic point of view .    1 .   it does not matter which potential @xmath31 is chosen to describe a particular system ,",
    "all of them will contain the same thermodynamic information .",
    "the prediction of the final equilibrium state is made in accordance with the  extremum principles \" ; these principles could be different for different potentials .",
    "the importance of the legendre transformations is that they always can be used to find a potential in which the extremum principles hold for the experimental working conditions .    for later use ,",
    "we summarize here the `` extremum principles '' @xcite :    * _ entropy maximum principle .",
    "_ the equilibrium value of any internal unconstrained parameter is such as to maximize the entropy for the given value of the total internal energy . * _ energy minimum principle . _",
    "the equilibrium value of any internal unconstrained parameter is such as to minimize the energy for the given value of the total entropy .",
    "* _ general minimum principle for the legendre transforms of the energy . _",
    "the equilibrium value of any unconstrained internal parameter is such as to minimize the legendre transform of the internal energy for a constant value of the transformed variable(s ) . * _ general maximum principle for the legendre transforms of the entropy . _",
    "the equilibrium value of any unconstrained internal parameter is such as to maximize the legendre transform of the entropy for a constant value of the transformed variable(s ) .",
    "consequently , we can talk about legendre invariance in two senses .",
    "firstly , in the sense that the thermodynamic information remains conserved under a legendre transformation and , secondly , in the sense that the same equilibrium value for one or several internal unconstrained parameters will be obtained , independently of the thermodynamic potential @xmath5 , under the condition that the experimental restrictions are according to the particular restrictions contained in the `` extremum principle '' for @xmath5 .    in the following sections , we will study the chemical reaction considering @xmath74 and @xmath75 either as ideal monoatomic gases or as van der waals monoatomic gases .",

    "@xmath145 generates a @xmath151dimensional equilibrium space @xmath152 for the @xmath59species . according to eq.([total ] ) , the fundamental equation of the chemical system @xmath153 will depend on @xmath154 variables .",
    "then , the total equilibrium space @xmath143 has @xmath154 dimensions . in general , the level of computational difficulty in geometry increases with the number of dimensions , so that for large @xmath144 the calculations could easily be outside the reach of computational capability .",
    "however , we can use the conditions of the reaction to reduce the number of dimensions .",
    "a common condition for reactions involving gases is that the reaction occurs at constant volume so that the functional dependence of the fundamental equation can be reduce to @xmath155 , i.e. , @xmath156 .",
    "furthermore , using the definition of the extent of reaction parameter , @xmath65 , we can replace all the @xmath148 s variables by @xmath64 , according to @xmath157 .",
    "since @xmath62 and @xmath63 are constants , the functional dependence of the fundamental equation reduces to @xmath158 . using the equations of state for each species",
    ", we can express each @xmath146 in terms of @xmath9 , @xmath148 and other constants .",
    "for instance , in the case of ideal gases we have that u= _",
    "i u_i = _ i c_i n_i r t = rt _ i c_i ( n_i,0 + _ i )  .",
    "then , we can express each @xmath146 as u_i(u , ) = u  , so that the fundamental equation becomes @xmath159 .",
    "consequently , the corresponding equilibrium manifold is 2-dimensional , independently of the number of species .    in the case of more complicated fundamental equations",
    ", it is always possible to express each @xmath146 in terms ofu and the extent of reaction in such a way that the resulting equilibrium manifold has only two dimensions .",
    "for instance , in the case of van der waals gases , we obtain u_i(u , ) = ( u + _ j ( n_j,0+_j ) ^2 ) - ( n_i,0+_i ) ^2  . [ redvdw ]",
    "let us now investigate the geodesic equations . to construct the metric @xmath160 of the equilibrium manifold @xmath143 , we can use the thermodynamic potential @xmath161 or any other potential that can be obtained from @xmath161 by means of a legendre transformation ( basically , @xmath162 ) .",
    "the results do not depend on the choice of @xmath5 , because the geometric properties of @xmath143 in gtd are legendre invariant .",
    "if we take the potential @xmath161 , the geodesic equations can be written in general as @xmath163    according to the picard - lindelf theorem @xcite , given an initial value , i.e. , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 , if @xmath143 is smooth -as in the preceding cases- , the solution to this equation exists and is unique . in the case of a chemical reaction , the value of @xmath164 is fixed by the initial equilibrium state of the reaction , but the value of @xmath168 remains free . in the case of ideal gases , in which @xmath9 is proportional to @xmath6 , the initial values of the second variable @xmath166 and @xmath167 are fixed by the conditions of the chemical reaction . in the case of more general species ,",
    "a legendre transformation must be performed such that @xmath6 becomes the second independent variable and the initial values are @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "we have seen in the examples above that the final equilibrium state of the reaction does not depend on @xmath168 and that the numerical integrator detects a  singularity \" at that point .",
    "it turns out that this corresponds to a coordinate singularity of the metric . to see this",
    ", we calculate the component @xmath171 of the general metric , and obtain [ componente ] g _ = ( ) ^-1 = ( _ i ) ^-1 ( _ i )  .",
    "this expression is valid for @xmath112 and all the thermodynamic potentials that can be obtained from @xmath11 by means of any legendre transformations -except those which change the role of @xmath64- .",
    "it is easily seen that as soon as the chemical - reaction equilibrium condition is satisfied , the denominator goes to zero and , thus , the metric is not well defined .",
    "this means that at the final equilibrium point the coordinates are not appropriate to describe the equilibrium manifold .",
    "notice that this result is completely general since it does not depend on the particular reaction that determines the potential @xmath5 .",
    "the fact that the final equilibrium state is characterized by a coordinate singularity allows us to perform an analytical investigation of that particular point .",
    "consider , for instance , the metric ( [ gig ] ) for two ideal gases in the @xmath132representation .",
    "the component @xmath172 presents a physical divergence when @xmath173 .",
    "the solution of this equation _",
    "f= with @xmath174 gives @xmath175 which is exactly the value obtained in the numerical investigating of the geodesic equations for this metric .    finally , let us mention an additional invariance property of the gtd approach . to reduce the number of independent variables of the fundamental equation in the case of van der waals gases , we used the relationship ( [ redvdw ] ) for @xmath176 with @xmath177 .",
    "however , due to the invariance of the metric @xmath160 under changes of coordinates , we can also use the same relationship as @xmath178 .",
    "then , the resulting fundamental equation becomes @xmath179 , once @xmath99 is fixed in accordance with the conditions of the reaction .",
    "the corresponding metric can be computed and the geodesic equations can be integrated numerically for @xmath10 and @xmath64 with the same initial conditions for @xmath64 , and @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "the resulting geodesics are exactly the same as the ones we obtained with @xmath161 .",
    "in this work , we used the formalism of gtd to present a geometric representation of chemical reactions in closed systems . in gtd , all the information about a thermodynamic system is encoded in its equilibrium manifold determined by a metric which is invariant under legendre transformations , i.e , its properties do not depend on the choice of thermodynamic potential .",
    "first , we consider the case of a chemical reaction with only two species corresponding either to ideal gases or to van der waals gases . in the case of ideal gases",
    ", we found that the equilibrium manifold is flat , independently of the thermodynamic potential . in gtd",
    ", a vanishing curvature means that there is no thermodynamic interaction .",
    "this agrees with the interpretation from the point of view of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics : with the statistical point of view , because the molecules of each ideal gas behave as  free particles \" since the hamiltonian contains exclusively the kinetic part ; and with the thermodynamic point of view , because there are no coupling terms in the fundamental equation . in the case of van der waals gases ,",
    "the curvature is different from zero , indicating the presence of thermodynamic interaction .",
    "this is also in accordance with the statistical approach to the van der waals system , because the hamiltonian contains a potential term which is responsible for the interaction between the molecules of the system .",
    "the thermodynamic analysis of the chemical reactions in both cases shows that the final equilibrium state is reached at a particular value of the extent of reaction parameter .",
    "the numerical analysis of the geodesics in the corresponding equilibrium manifolds provides exactly the same value of the extent of reaction for the final equilibrium state .",
    "it is evident that all the geodesics follow a path pattern that ends at the same equilibrium state , independently of the initial values of @xmath164 and @xmath140 .",
    "moreover , the final equilibrium state is always denoted as a singularity by the numerical integrator .    in order to understand our results in a more general fashion",
    ", we analyzed a general reaction in the context of gtd .",
    "we showed that using the conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium and the laboratory conditions of the reaction , it is always possible to reduce to two the number of dimensions of the equilibrium manifold .",
    "this is an interesting result that allows us to describe any chemical reaction as a geodesic curve on a @xmath0dimensional space .",
    "finally , it was shown that the metric of the equilibrium manifold possesses a coordinate singularity exactly at that point where the condition for the reaction equilibrium is satisfied .",
    "the examples of chemical reactions presented in this work involve only gases .",
    "nevertheless , the generalization to include reactions involving solids or liquids is straightforward .",
    "indeed , once the fundamental equations of the species are given , we can construct the corresponding massieu - planck potential of the reaction which allows us to consider @xmath7 and @xmath6 as constants .",
    "the main conclusions of this work is that to any chemical reaction in a closed system we can associate a @xmath0dimensional equilibrium manifold , and that any chemical reaction can be represented as a geodesic in which the initial state is determined by the initial conditions of the reaction and the final state corresponds to a coordinate singularity of the thermodynamic metric .",
