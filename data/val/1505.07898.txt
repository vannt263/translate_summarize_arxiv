    "the stability of thin films on substrates has been for a long time a basic subject of research , not only because of the numerous technological applications , including coatings , adhesives , lubricants , and dielectric layers , but also because of their fundamental interest  @xcite .",
    "the dewetting of thin liquid films is the process of destabilization of such films which leads to the formation of drops .",
    "it is generally observed when the supported liquid film is placed on a substrate under partial wetting conditions , and subject to destabilizing intermolecular forces . for a homogeneous isotropic liquid on a uniform solid substrate ,",
    "two main dewetting processes are known : ( i ) the nucleation of holes at defects or dust particles , and ( ii ) the amplification of perturbations at the free surface ( e.g. , capillary waves ) under the destabilizing effect of long - range intermolecular forces in the so - called spinodal dewetting  @xcite .",
    "although the distinction between these two dewetting processes is well established in the literature , there is still a lot of debate about which of these mechanisms is actually observed in a given experiment .    in this context ,",
    "lubrication approximations to the full navier - stokes equations have shown to be extremely useful for investigating the dynamics and instability of thin liquid films on substrates , including the motion and instabilities of their contact lines  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical treatment of the coating problem is greatly simplified if the film is so thin that the lubrication approximation can be employed . when this modeling is valid , it is possible to determine the velocity field of the liquid as a function of the film thickness , and the problem reduces to the solution of a nonlinear evolution equation for the thickness profile of the film . to leading order , at low speeds , the dynamics",
    "is controlled by a balance among capillarity , viscosity , and intermolecular forces , without inertia playing a role .",
    "this approach has achieved considerable success in dealing with the solution of this class of problems  @xcite .",
    "however , in some applications such as the dewetting of nano - scale thin metallic films on hydrophobic substrates , the effects related to inertia and the shortcomings of the lubrication approximation assumptions ( requiring small slopes and consequently small contact angles ) appear to have a crucial influence on the dynamics and morphology of the film  @xcite .",
    "experimental studies of unstable thin films coating solids have shown significant differences in the patterns that develop when fluid instabilities lead to the formation of growing _ dry regions _ on the solid .",
    "the effects of inertia on the instability have been studied previously in other problems , for example for a film flowing down an incline  @xcite , the breakup of a liquid filament sitting on a substrate  @xcite , and several other configurations  @xcite .",
    "however , these problems do not include explicitly the effects of the intermolecular interaction between the molecules of the liquid and those of the solid . here , we consider it by using integrated lennard - jones forces , which lead to the disjoining pressure that entails the power dependence on the fluid thickness  @xcite . in the present context ,",
    "the occurrence and nature of both inertia and bidimensional effects in the liquid film on the solid substrate is of interest , not only for fundamental research , but also for technological applications .    the solutions of problems under the lubrication approximation",
    "is usually limited to speeds low enough to give small capillary and reynolds numbers .",
    "the extension of the theory to higher speeds introduces inertia into the problem , and , even in the case of thin films , the analysis may become much more difficult .",
    "the great simplification previously found by the application of the lubrication theory no longer exists ; instead , the system is governed by the coupling of a nonlinear partial differential equation for the velocity field , and an evolution equation for the thickness profile .",
    "it is possible , however , to find a class of problems in which inertial effects can be assessed within the long wave framework . in this work",
    "we are concerned with the instability of a flat liquid film extended over a solid plane , and subject to intermolecular forces between the liquid and the solid substrate .",
    "then , the film evolution is studied by considering viscous , surface tension , and intermolecular forces , with special emphasis on the effect of inertia in the development of the instability .",
    "we consider a thin liquid film of thickness @xmath2 , which spans infinitely in the @xmath3-direction ( the system is invariant in the @xmath4-direction , i.e. plane flow conditions prevail ) , and rests on a solid plane at @xmath5 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sketch_lam]a ) . here , we will consider the instability of this initially flat film under the action of surface tension and intermolecular forces , acting both at the free surface of the film with instantaneous thickness @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the hydrodynamic evolution is governed by the navier - stokes equation and the incompressibility condition , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the liquid density , @xmath9 its viscosity , @xmath10 the pressure and @xmath11 the velocity field . at the substrate ( @xmath5 )",
    ", we apply the no - slip and non - penetration conditions . at the free surface , @xmath12",
    ", we have the usual kinematic condition and normal stress equilibrium given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the surface tension , @xmath15 the curvature of the surface , and @xmath16 ,      \\label{eq : pih}\\ ] ] is the disjoining pressure . here , @xmath17 is a constant with units of pressure ( related to the hamaker constant of the system ) , the exponents satisfy @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the equilibrium thickness ( of the order of some nanometers ) .",
    "this surface force is a consequence of the interaction among the molecules in the three phases present in the problem , namely the liquid of the film , the solid substrate and the surrounding gas .",
    "note that at equilibrium , i.e. when @xmath20 , the film has a uniform pressure @xmath21 , since @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "in this approximation it is assumed that the film thickness , @xmath2 , is much smaller than the characteristic horizontal length of the problem .",
    "since the film extends to infinity , we assume that there exists a typical length associated with the wavelength of the perturbations , namely @xmath24 . the definition of @xmath24 will be made more precise below .",
    "subsequently , for @xmath25 , we can simplify eq .",
    "( [ eq : ns_dim ] ) under the long wave approximation assumptions retaining inertial terms in the form @xmath26    the boundary conditions for these equations are as follows . at @xmath5 ,",
    "we impose no penetration and no slip at the substrate , @xmath27 at the liquid - gas interface ( @xmath28 ) , we have zero shear stress , @xmath29 as well as the kinematic condtion , @xmath30 and the laplace relation for the capillary pressure @xmath31 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dpdz ] ) we see that the pressure , @xmath10 , is @xmath32-independent , and then @xmath10 is only a function of @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "thus , we have that the @xmath3-derivative of @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mov ] ) is given by @xmath35    the continuity equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : cont ] ) , is conveniently satisfied by introducing the stream function @xmath36 defined by @xmath37 therefore , eqs .  ( [ eq : mov ] ) and ( [ eq : kin ] ) in terms of @xmath38 are given by @xmath39 @xmath40 the boundary conditions , given by eqs .",

    "( [ eq : lin ] ) into eqs .",
    "( [ eq : psi3_h ] ) and ( [ eq : psi_h ] ) , and retaining terms up to order one in @xmath47 , we have @xmath48 with the boundary conditions @xmath49    now , we define the horizontal length scale , @xmath24 , by choosing @xmath50 , so that it turns out @xmath51 where @xmath52 since @xmath53 and @xmath54 , we have @xmath55 .",
    "note that we are here including in @xmath24 all the effects related with the magnitude of the intermolecular forces given by @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , this constant is usually related in the literature with the contact angle , @xmath56 , which appears at the contact regions formed when the film thins up to @xmath19 , and characterizes the partial wetting of the substrate . it is found that the following simple relationship holds  @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "thus , the characteristic length scale becomes @xmath59 so that this length includes all the parameters determining the problem , except for @xmath14 and @xmath9 which yield the time scale ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) below ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch_lam]b , we show how the dimensionless combination @xmath60 depends on the ratio @xmath61 for two fixed values of the exponents pair @xmath62 .",
    "interestingly , very small values of @xmath19 as well as @xmath19 close to @xmath63 yield very large values of @xmath64 for given contact angle , @xmath65 .",
    "consequently , a convenient non - dimensional version of the problem for the long wave approximation is given by the following scaling @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the time scale .",

    "the main advantage of this technique compared to others such as the level set of phase field techniques is that the fluid interface is and remains sharp .",
    "the main drawback , on the other hand , is that the mesh connectivity must remain the same , which precludes the modelling of situations for which the topology might change .",

    "the 1d model is not a good approximation , except for very small @xmath47 , as expected . for both models ,",
    "we use @xmath257 since the behavior of @xmath248 and @xmath249 is of the exponential type from the very beginning .",

    "this effect is still more pronounced for @xmath196 as large as @xmath260 . in these cases , where there is still an acceptable agreement between the 2d model and the numerics for relatively large @xmath47",
    "however , for this very large value of @xmath196 , as @xmath47 is decreased neither 1d nor 2d models are able to capture the actual evolution of the complete nonlinear problem .",

    ". clearly , both cases are practically coincident in the linear stage , and are in agreement with the linear 2d model . for larger times , the corresponding non - linear regimes strongly differ , thus leading to different breakup times , so that the effect of the exponents is limited to the short final non - linear stage . similarly , fig .",

    "for @xmath245 as small as @xmath264 , no difference is observed neither in the linear nor in the nonlinear stages .",
    "this so because @xmath245 becomes negligible with respect to @xmath265 .",
    "in this work , we have developed three different approaches to study the instability of a flat liquid thin film under partial wetting conditions , and subject to intermolecular forces ( disjoining pressure ) : long wave 1d model ( with inertia ) , liner 2d model , and fully nonlinear numerical simulations .",
    "firstly , we have extended the purely viscous analysis within the lubrication approximation to one where inertial effects are taken into account , which we call for brevity 1d model .",
    "the lsa of this model shows that inertia does not lead to new regions of instability compared with the purely viscous case .",
    "instead , it adds new stable modes : some which are exponentially decaying , and others which are damped oscillations .",
    "the former extend over the same range of the unstable modes and even beyond , while the latter appear for larger wavenumbers . in the unstable region of most interest here",
    ", we find that both the marginal wavenumber and that of the maximum growth rate do not change at all with the addition of inertia .",
    "however , the results clearly show that the growth rates of the instability decrease as inertial effects are stronger .",
    "the intensity of these effects is here quantified by a single parameter , namely the modified laplace number , @xmath266 .",
    "therefore , the approximation can be applied only for large @xmath196 , since @xmath204 is required for the approach to be valid .",
    "secondly , we develop a lsa of the navier  stokes equation , so that the restriction of small aspect ratio , @xmath47 , is no longer required .",
    "this calculation , called for brevity 2d model , is particularly useful to assess the accuracy of the 1d model predictions .",
    "the main difference between these models is the way that inertia is treated . in linear 1d model , the convective terms for the horizontal direction",
    "are still taken into account , while horizontal and vertical convective terms are neglected in the linear 2d model , but the viscous laplacian term is now fully conserved for both directions .",
    "thus , we have now two independent parameters to characterize the flow , namely @xmath196 and @xmath47 .",
    "the 2d model shows that the marginal wavenumber remains the same as 1d model , and does not depend on @xmath196 .",
    "however , unlike 1d model , 2d model shows that @xmath220 is not constant , and decreases as @xmath196 increases .",
    "this is an important result , since it shows that inertia can modify the distance between the final drops , which must be more separated with respect to the purely viscous case .",
    "with respect to the dependence of the growth rates with @xmath196 , 2d model also shows that they decrease for increasing @xmath196 , but the strength of the effect is greater than what is predicted by 1d model .",
    "interestingly , the discrepancies between both models decrease as @xmath196 increases , i.e. for larger inertial effects .",
    "note also that both models capture the main scaling of the dimensional growth rate , @xmath198 , with the aspect ratio @xmath47 .",
    "thus , we can write , @xmath267 where the subscripts @xmath256 and @xmath268 correspond to 1d and 2d models , respectively .     that determines the influence of @xmath19 on the characteristic length scale , @xmath24 .",
    "]    finally , we are concerned now with obtaining a prediction of the both @xmath269 and @xmath1 as a function of the film thickness , @xmath2 , for a given experimental configuration . in order to do so , we recall that  @xcite @xmath270 where @xmath44 is the hamaker constant . thus , the characteristic length , @xmath24 , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ell ] ) can be written as @xmath271 where @xmath272 being @xmath273 . the function @xmath274 , which describes the effects of @xmath19 , is shown in fig .",

    ", we notice that @xmath277 , thus @xmath278 and @xmath279 .",
    "instead , if @xmath280 , say @xmath281 , the behaviour is different since @xmath282 for decreasing @xmath19 . for @xmath283 , we have @xmath284 , thus @xmath285 and @xmath286 .",
    "these results shoud be taken into account when analyzing experimental data within a given hydrodynamic model .",
    "for instance , the lubrication approximation would not become more valid as @xmath2 decreases ( as it could be expected _ a priori _ ) since @xmath47 increases for thinner films .",
    "in fact , let us consider the data from the experiments with melted copper films on a @xmath287 substrate reported in  @xcite . in this case , we have @xmath288 , @xmath289 , and the experiments",
    "could be fitted with a purely viscous lubrication model using @xmath290 , @xmath291 and @xmath243 .",
    "thus , we calculate the corresponding values of @xmath47 and @xmath196 for film thickness , @xmath2 , in the interval @xmath292 , as shown fig .  [",
    "fig : param]a .",
    "note that even if inertial effects increase as @xmath2 increases , @xmath47 decreases even faster , so that lubrication approximation assumptions apply for larger @xmath2 s ( see also @xmath125 in fig .",
    "[ fig : param]b ) .",
    "consistently , fig .",
    "[ fig : param]b indicates that the length @xmath24 ( proportional to the critical wavelength ) increases with @xmath2 , so that wavelengths of some hundreds of nanometers should be expected for these film thicknesses .    .",
