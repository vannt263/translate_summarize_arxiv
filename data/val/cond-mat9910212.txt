    "the option pricing formula of black - scholes is arguably one of the most successful modern applications of quantitative mathematical analysis . despite its great simplicity",
    "it gives prices of the most actively traded options on leading markets which are typically not off by more than a few percent .",
    "this has paved the way for an influx of advanced ideas from the theory of stochastic processes into finance . in the most general formulation of the no - arbitrage argument of black - scholes  @xcite and cox et al  @xcite it was established by harrison - kreps  @xcite that a price system ( under certain restrictions such as no trading costs ) admits no arbitrage opportunities if and only if there exists an equivalent probability measure , with respect to which all discounted price processes of underlying and derivative securities are martingales .",
    "this theory is presented in several excellent monographs , see  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these developments do not yield a fully general solution to the derivative pricing problem , since the equivalent martingale measure is not uniquely defined , except if the market is complete . if the market is incomplete",
    "there are many possible equivalent martingale measures , and each of these specifies a price system without arbitrage opportunities .    in the lognormal model of black - scholes",
    "the market of one share and one bond is already complete .",
    "one can thus test its predictions by computing the volatility of the price process of the underlying security , plugging that into the black - scholes formula , and then comparing with observed market prices of a derivative : such tests were initiated already by black - scholes  @xcite and black  @xcite .",
    "the volatility from historical data is obviously subject to measurement errors and statistical fluctuations .",
    "a more robust test is therefore if observed option prices can be fitted by a black - scholes formula with volatility treated as a free parameter .",
    "there are several recent reports that this is not so , see rubinstein  @xcite , and earlier investigations  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the lognormal model there exists a wider class of it processes in continuous time for which the market is also complete , and the derivative pricing problem can be solved only by no - arbitrage conditions . to distinguish which model in this class",
    "is the best approximation to observed data , and then to use it , is however already not a trivial task , see e.g  @xcite .    for the rest of this paper we will consider the general case of an incomplete market , but we do keep the standard assumption of no market friction .",
    "we introduce a criterion to price derivatives in this situation .",
    "stated differently , we advance an argument as to which out of many possible equivalent martingale measures is the appropriate one .",
    "we refer to this criterion as the principle of no almost sure arbitrage  @xcite : it is based on the theory of optimal gambling of kelly  @xcite .",
    "we will consider an investor that gambles on investing in an underlying and a derivative security , and who looks for the growth - optimal investment strategies among such combinations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ s : kelly ] we summarize and discuss the kelly theory in a version appropriate for our purposes .",
    "we discuss also here the papers of samuelson  @xcite and merton - samuelson  @xcite . in section  [",
    "s : principle - nasa ] , the technical core of the paper , we apply the kelly theory to derivative pricing , and in section  [ s : remarks ] we discuss the relations and differences to other proposed alternative derivative pricing procedures .",
    "it is straight - forward to see that in complete markets our procedure agrees with the standard ones , e.g. with the models of cox - ross - rubinstein and black - scholes . in section  [ s : lognormal ] we discuss the lognormal limit of our procedure , the limits of its applicability , and that it is not exactly equivalent to the black - scholes formula . in section  [ s : error ] we study the expected scatter of the optimal investment fraction and report a small - scale empirical test of pricing options on the swedish omx index . in section  [ s : multiasset ] we generalize the method to a market with correlated stocks . in section  [ s : conclusion ] we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "an earlier version of this paper was circulated in 1998  @xcite .",
    "a longer sequel was also made available in the electronic archive  @xcite , lacking however in the version accepted for publication , material corresponding to sections  [ s : error ] and  [ s : multiasset ] below .",
    "the presentation in the present paper is significally different from  @xcite and contains a fuller discussion of the implementation of the model and the economic background .",
    "the theory to be exposed in this section is due to kelly  @xcite , who was looking for an interpretation of information theory of shannon @xcite outside of the context of communication , and to the treatment of the st .",

    "for a recent review of growth - optimal investment strategies , see hakanson - ziemba  @xcite .",
    "consider a price movement of stock or some other security which is described by @xmath0 where time is discrete , @xmath1 is the price at time @xmath2 and the @xmath3 s are independent , identically distributed random variables .",
    "the assumptions on the @xmath3 s can be relaxed .",
    "consider now an investor which starts at time @xmath4 with a wealth @xmath5 , and who decides to gamble on this stock repeatedly .",
    "suppose that the investor chooses to commit at each time a fraction @xmath6 of his capital in stock , and the rest in a risk - less security .",
    "we set the risk - less rate to zero .",
    "a non - zero risk - less rate corresponds to a discount factor in the definition of the share prices , and can be accounted for by a redefinition of the @xmath3 s .",
    "the investor will hence hold at time @xmath2 a number @xmath7 of shares , and his wealth at successive instants of time follows a multiplicative random process @xmath8 in the large time limit we have by the law of large numbers that the exponential growth rate of the wealth tends with probability one to a constant .",
    "that is , @xmath9 .",
    "\\label{eq : lambda - definition}\\ ] ]    the optimal gambling strategy in the sense of kelly consists in maximizing @xmath10 in ( [ eq : lambda - definition ] ) by varying @xmath6 .",
    "the solution must be unique because the logarithm is a concave function of its argument .",
    "which values of @xmath6 are reasonable in our problem ?",
    "first , the optimum @xmath6 must be such that @xmath11 is positive on the support of @xmath12 .",
    "second , we must decide if the investor is allowed to borrow money . in the original formulation of kelly he is not ,",
    "but here it is useful to assume that the investor may do so at a risk - less rate .",
    "furthermore we also assume that the investor can go short i.e. , it is possible to borrow stocks .",
    "hence we allow @xmath6 to take any finite positive or negative value , and look for the maximum of @xmath10 .",
    "the desired strategy is hence the only finite @xmath6 which solves @xmath13=0 \\label{eq : l - star - definition}\\ ] ] and the maximum realized growth rate is @xmath14 \\label{eq : lambda - star - definition}\\ ] ] let us look more closely at ( [ eq : l - star - definition ] ) if @xmath12 can take the values @xmath15 with probabilities @xmath16 .",
    "let us write @xmath17 such that ( [ eq : l - star - definition ] ) reads @xmath18    from @xmath19 being positive it follows that the @xmath20 s are all positive , and from ( [ eq : q - equation ] ) it follows that the sum of the @xmath20 s is one .",
    "the @xmath20 s thus form a new set of probabilities , and , again by ( [ eq : q - equation ] ) , with respect to these the stock price process is a martingale .",
    "it is worthwhile to discuss this point at some length in light of the well - known papers of samuelson  @xcite and merton - samuelson  @xcite .",
    "these authors demonstrated that if the risk / return preferences of an agent is described by an expected utility , then the growth - optimal strategy does not maximize that utility , except if the utility is logarithmic , and the price process is similar to  ( [ eq : u_i - definition ] ) .",
    "it is a mathematical fact that the growth rate  ( [ eq : lambda - definition ] ) holds with probability one . if a gambler would choose any other strategy in @xmath6 but that which maximizes @xmath21 then he would in the large time limit almost surely end up with an exponentially smaller capital .    in the counter - examples of samuelson - merton",
    "the dominant contribution to non - logarithmic utility comes from events with asymptotically ( in time ) vanishing probability .",
    "when sets of measure zero are involved , the relation between sample and ensemble averages becomes delicate .",
    "suppose some agents want to maximize a non - logarithmic utility , and that they choose strategies accordingly .",
    "if they do so , and we compare with them using the growth - optimal strategy , they would almost surely end up with less utility according to their own criterion .",
    "only if there would be an ensemble of infinitely many agents , all using this same strategy , then some few would actually end up with higher utility . and",
    ", in fact , so much higher that the averaged utility over the ensemble would be increased .",
    "this is the sense in which other strategies can be ` better ' than the growth - optimal strategies .",
    "therefore , merton - samuelson give preference to ensemble averages over sample average .",
    "this is a problematic point , which has apparently not received much attention in the economic literature .",
    "a simple counter - argument against the growth - optimal criterion is that time in economical problems , in the sense considered here , is perhaps often not very long .",
    "however , this is essentially a quantitive question , which has to be decided case - by - case . for recent discussions of characteristic times in the kelly problem with transaction costs ,",
    "see  @xcite",
    "let us now consider the stock of section  [ s : kelly ] and one derivative security on the same stock .",
    "the argument generalizes at every step in an obvious way to an arbitrary number of derivatives , but to keep the notation simple we will write out the formulae for one derivative . to begin , let us write the present share price at the time @xmath2 @xmath22 , and let us assume that the realized value of the derivate at the next future instant of time is @xmath23 .",
    "the unknown parameter is the present price of derivative , which we will write @xmath24 .",
    "we will further suppose that this situation is repeated over and over again .",
    "that is , we assume that the investor finds himself many times in the situation that if he keeps some money @xmath25 in stock it will be worth @xmath26 , while if he keeps the same money in the derivative it will be worth @xmath27 , with the same random variable @xmath28 entering into both expressions .",
    "the simplest example is one time step before expiration time of a call option with a present share price @xmath29 and a strike price @xmath30 ; in this case one has @xmath31 .",
    "if at the @xmath2th stage in this gamble the investor commits a fraction @xmath6 of his wealth in shares and a fraction @xmath32 in the derivative , this means @xmath33 shares and @xmath34 derivatives .",
    "after the random variable @xmath3 has taken a value , the wealth is changed to @xmath35 if the investor plays this game many times , his wealth will almost surely grow at an exponential rate ( over these games ) which is @xmath36 \\label{eq : double - lyapunov - exponent}\\ ] ]    let us now assume that we compute ( [ eq : double - lyapunov - exponent ] ) and that we find an optimal growth rate @xmath37 \\label{eq : double - lyapunov - exponent - optimal}\\ ] ] and that this is realized at fractions @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "if @xmath39 is larger than zero , then all operators would like to buy the derivative . hence its present price @xmath40 would tend to rise , and its rate of return would fall . the fraction @xmath39 would thus tend to fall . if , on the other hand , @xmath39 would be less than zero , then all operators would want to go short on the derivative , its present price would fall , its rate of return would rise and @xmath39 would tend to rise .",
    "the only value of @xmath24 in which the market can be in equilibrium is therefore the one such that @xmath41 is zero .",
    "this statement was referred to as the principle of no almost sure arbitrage in @xcite .",
    "we remark that from the technical point of view , this procedure , where @xmath39 is taken to vanish , is closely similar to the samuelson s",
    "@xcite methodology of warrant pricing in the ` incipient case ' , see merton  @xcite .",
    "@xmath40 and the fractions @xmath6 and @xmath32 thus satisfy two equations .",
    "one is @xmath42 \\label{eq : l_s - star - definition}\\ ] ] which is identical to ( [ eq : l - star - definition ] ) of the kelly model , and therefore determines @xmath38 .",
    "the other is @xmath43 \\label{eq : c_0-star - definition}\\ ] ] if we now compare with ( [ eq : q - definition ] ) and ( [ eq : q - equation ] ) we see that ( [ eq : c_0-star - definition ] ) can be written @xmath44 which states that the derivative price process is a martingale with respect to @xmath45 .",
    "we have constructed the equivalent martingale measure @xmath45 over one elementary time - step . by compounding",
    "we can construct , from @xmath46 convolutions of @xmath45 distribution , the price distributions over many time - steps @xmath47 .",
    "the price of , say , a european call option with expiration time @xmath46 at time @xmath48 , can thus be written in the standard manner as @xmath49 \\quad c(t , s_t ) = max ( s_t - k,0 ) \\label{eq : equivalent - martingale - pricing - t}\\ ] ] where the expectation value is taken with respect to the many time - steps distribution @xmath50 over share prices @xmath51 at time @xmath46 , conditioned by the share price having been @xmath1 at time @xmath2 .",
    "we have taken the risk - less rate to be zero .",
    "a non - zero risk - less rate can be put back in as a discount factor in the share prices , which leads to a different definition of the @xmath12 s , the returns over elementary periods of time , and hence to different @xmath45 s .",
    "the pricing procedure proposed in section  [ s : principle - nasa ] is based on a particular choice of an equivalent martingale measure .",
    "it therefore follows that this procedure is arbitrage - free .",
    "it also follows that it must agree with no - arbitrage pricing in complete markets",
    ".    it may nevertheless be instructive to carry through the calculations of section  [ s : principle - nasa ] explicitly for the cox - ross - rubinstein model .",
    "we hence assume that the discounted share price can go up by a fraction @xmath52 with probability @xmath53 , down by @xmath54 with probability @xmath55 , and that @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the risk - free interest rate .",
    "equation  [ eq : l_s - star - definition ] is then solved for @xmath38 as @xmath58 and this reproduces the cox - ross - rubinstein measure @xmath45 , independent of @xmath53 .",
    "the maximum growth rate however still depends on @xmath53 , and is @xmath59 the black - scholes model can now be derived as the continuous - time limit of the cox - ross - rubinstein model .",
    "the growth rate ( [ eq : crr - kullback - contrast ] ) is the kullback contrast of the measure @xmath45 with respect to the measure @xmath53 in the dichotomic case .",
    "it is easy to see that this is the general form of the solution , and that the measure @xmath45 can be obtained as follows : consider a security with price process determined by a measure @xmath53 , and consider all measures @xmath45 with respect to which the price process of the security is a martingale",
    ". then the particular measure @xmath45 which we compute from ( [ eq : l_s - star - definition ] ) ( see also equations  ( [ eq : q - definition ] ) and  ( [ eq : q - equation ] ) ) is the one that minimizes the kullback contrast @xmath60 =   -\\sum_n   p_n \\log\\frac{p_n}{q_n }   \\label{eq : kullback - contrast}\\ ] ] our proposal therefore coincides , over one time step , with one of the two proposals recently put forward by stutzer  @xcite .",
    "stutzer s formulae differ from ours in that we posit the minimization of ( [ eq : kullback - contrast ] ) under the martingale constraint for the elementary process over each time - step , while stutzer applies ( [ eq : kullback - contrast ] ) directly on the probability distribution over a finite time interval .",
    "a similar approach minimizing the relative entropy distance to calibrate a pricing model has been suggested by avellaneda et al @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to remark that if we perform the quadratic approximation of the logarithm in ( [ eq : lambda - definition ] ) around the expected return on capital , @xmath61 $ ] , and then look for the optimal portfolio , we obtain @xmath62 } ( u-1-\\mu)\\right ) p(u ) \\quad ; \\quad \\mu = e^p[u-1 ] \\label{eq : quadratic - expansion}\\ ] ] equation ( [ eq : quadratic - expansion ] ) reproduces the least - square option pricing procedure of follmer - sondermann  @xcite , schl@xcite and schweizer  @xcite .",
    "another approach to option pricing based on global least - square minimization was recently proposed by bouchaud - sornette  @xcite , see also  @xcite , but has now been proven by wolczynska @xcite and hammarlid  @xcite to give the same least - square solution , see also schweizer  @xcite . the empirical tests of  @xcite and  @xcite , which pertain mainly to the case of small @xmath63 , hence also validate our theory .",
    "a conceptual problem of least - square option pricing , first shown by dybvig - ingersoll  @xcite , is that it can assign negative prices of some state - contingent claims .",
    "this may lead to negative prices of derivatives with strictly non - negative pay - off , and hence to arbitrage opportunities . in ( [ eq :",
    "quadratic - expansion ] ) this happens when @xmath12 is sufficiently large , provided @xmath63 is positive . from our point of view",
    "this result is clear .",
    "negative prices appear only at capital values for which the quadratic approximation is a decreasing function .",
    "it is precisely because quadratic utility is not monotonically increasing that its maximization only gives a pseudo - martingale measure , which can take both positive and negative values .",
    "our theory is practically equivalent to the least - square method when that one has no problems , i.e. , when we look at small deviations from the most probable realizations of the capital returns and when @xmath63 is small . in the opposite",
    "limits our theory deviates from least - square minimization , always prices derivatives by a proper equivalent martingale measure , and the problem of possible negative prices does not appear .",
    "the distribution @xmath47 is constructed by compounding the measure @xmath45 of one time - step .",
    "if @xmath12 only takes only a finite number of values , then @xmath47 can be written as a multinomial expansion . however ,",
    "if the number of time steps is large , then the multinomial expansion is unwieldy , and some other approach must be found for analytic and numerical work .",
    "the asymptotic price distribution is of course determined by the behavior of aggregated logarithmic returns , and this is intimately linked to the lognormal distribution , its applicability and its limits .",
    "let us assume that @xmath64 $ ] is finite .",
    "then , for the most probable realizations , @xmath47 is well approximated by a lognormal distribution , i.e. @xmath65    where    @xmath66 \\quad ;   \\quad \\delta^2= e^q[(\\log u)^2]-(e^q[\\log u])^2 \\label{eq : lambda - delta - definitions}\\ ] ]    for large @xmath46 only low - probability events are not distributed according to  ( [ eq : lognormal - approximation ] ) .",
    "for the treatment of such large , but very rare , events the proper mathematical setting is the theory of large deviations , see varadhan  @xcite . in",
    "@xcite we discuss the use of large deviations theory to price derivatives related to rare events .",

    "that is , in the lognormal approximation one looses the martingale property .",
    "our lognormal approximation does not agree with a straight - forward application of the black - scholes formula .",
    "we recall that the black - scholes theory also involves lognormal distribution . in the parameterization of ( [ eq : lognormal - approximation ] ) it is characterized by drift coefficient @xmath70 and volatility @xmath71 , related through @xmath72-(e^p[\\log u])^2\\ ] ] it is easy to understand that if @xmath12 has support concentrated around one , then the difference between @xmath73 and @xmath74 is small . in the continuous limit",

    "the distribution @xmath75 has been computed by a monte carlo procedure .",
    "here it is obvious that one has to consider the corrections to the lognormal to get a good approximation to @xmath75 .",
    "we observe that if @xmath12 has support around one the predictions of the black - scholes theory and the lognormal approximation are both rather close to the exact formula : this is the case in figure  [ f : prices - narrow ] . in figure",

    "this result is a consequence of the property @xmath147 where @xmath148 and @xmath149 are the martingale measures of one and two shares respectively .    in the case of a complete market",
    "it is a known fact that the martingale measure @xmath148 is unique  @xcite , then it can not be anything else but the measure  ( [ eq : q - definition ] ) found by optimizing the growth rate for just that particular stock @xmath150 the property  ( [ eq : property ] ) is also preserved in the risk minimization pricing procedure but not in the general case of an incomplete market . in this situation the associated martingale measure  ( [ eq : generalq ] ) depend on the number of stocks traded in the market @xmath151 in figure  [ fig : multiasset ] we show this difference on the option prices for the trichotomic case .",

    "we have in this paper introduced a new criterion to price derivatives in incomplete markets derived from the theory of optimal gambling strategies in repeated games .",
    "the criterion say that one should not be able to construct a portfolio using derivatives that grows almost surely at a faster exponential rate than using only the underlying security .",
    "a corner - stone in modern derivative pricing theory is that discounted prices ( in friction - less markets ) can be expressed as expected pay - off , expectations taken with respect to equivalent martingale measures .",
    "we use the criterion to decide which out of many possible measures to choose .",
    "we therefore do not need to assume a complete market to fix unambiguously a price .    in section  [ s :",
    "remarks ] we compared our approach to other procedures proposed in the literature , and in section  [ s : lognormal ] we discussed the lognormal limit . in our construction",
    "we determined first the equivalent martingale measure over one elementary time - step . by composition",
    "we can then get the risk - neutral distribution at finite times . in a large class of models",
    "this compounded probability tends to the lognormal form , at the points close to the maximum , where probability is high .",
    "one could then conclude that we just rederive the black - scholes model , except for rare events .",
    "this is however not true , because , for us , the condition that the risk - neutral distribution is a martingale involves also the distribution of rare and large events .",
    "these are not lognormal .",
    "in fact , the best lognormal approximation does not by itself have to be a martingale , and in general differs from black - scholes .",
