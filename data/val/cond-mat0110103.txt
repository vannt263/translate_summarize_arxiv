    "modern magnetic recording technologies involve particles that are near the _ superparamagnetic limit_. in this limit , the energy barrier separating the two energetically degenerate magnetic orientations is small enough that thermal fluctuations frequently lead to spontaneous switching of the orientation . as a result , the magnetic coercivity decreases with decreasing particle size for particles below the superparamagnetic size limit .",

    "degrade recorded information , the engineering challenge has been to keep the energy barrier in the individual particles high enough to make spontaneous switching infrequent while keeping the material magnetically soft enough to facilitate recording . as the volumes of the magnetic particles have shrunk to reach recording densities on the order of 100  gb / in@xmath0 or more @xcite , materials with higher coercivities due to strong crystalline anisotropies",

    "the domains control switching through the field - driven motion of preexisting domain walls @xcite .",
    "however , if the anisotropy is largely crystalline , there exists a range of single - domain particle sizes that are larger than @xmath10 but smaller than the size at which the particle becomes multidomain ( often the case in ultrathin films @xcite ) .    in anisotropic",

    "metastable phase_. this nonequilibrium phase decays by thermally assisted nucleation and subsequent growth of localized regions , inside which the magnetization is parallel with the field @xcite .",
    "these growing regions are referred to as _ droplets _ to distinguish them from equilibrium domains .",
    "this mechanism yields results very similar to recent experiments on single - domain nanoscale ferromagnets @xcite .      here",
    "we present a short summary of homogeneous nucleation theory as it applies to uniaxial magnets .",
    "this theory covers situations in which the switching events are nucleated by thermal fluctuations , without the influence of defects .",
    "further details are available in @xcite .",
    "the central problems in nucleation theory are to identify the fluctuations that lead to the decay of the metastable phase and to obtain their free - energy cost relative to the metastable phase . for anisotropic systems dominated by short - range interactions , these fluctuations are compact droplets of radius @xmath11 .",

    "thus , one would expect the loop area to show this logarithmic frequency dependence in the asymptotic low - frequency limit .",
    "analytic calculations have confirmed this asymptotic result .",
    "however , for higher , but still low , frequencies they show a very slow crossover to the asymptotic behavior , which is confirmed by monte carlo simulations .",
    "such a slow crossover could easily be mistaken for a power law , even when observed over several decades in frequency @xcite .",
    "this result was shown to hold , both when the magnetization reversal occurs via the single - droplet mechanism @xcite and the multidroplet mechanism @xcite , even though the details are different .",
    "the behavior is illustrated in the top part of fig .",

    ", the transition from symmetric to asymmetric hysteresis loops becomes a genuine critical phenomenon at a sharply defined critical frequency .",
    "the transition is essentially due to a competition between two time scales : the metastable lifetime , @xmath150 , and the frequency of the applied field , @xmath151 . as a result ,",
    "the critical value of the reduced frequency @xmath137 is on the order of unity .",
    "this nonequilibrium phase transition was first observed in numerical solutions of mean - field equations of motion for ferromagnets in oscillating fields @xcite .",
    "subsequently it has been observed in numerous monte carlo simulations of kinetic ising systems @xcite and in further mean - field studies @xcite .",
    "it may also have been experimentally observed in ultrathin films of co on cu(100 ) @xcite .    in this far - from - equilibrium phase transition the role of order parameter is played by the period - averaged magnetization , @xmath152 .",

    "[ fig : dpt](*b * ) . both the order parameter and its fluctuations depend on @xmath28 in a way very similar to data from simulations of _ equilibrium _ phase transitions . and ,",
    "indeed , formal finite - size scaling analysis of the monte carlo data @xcite , as well as analytical arguments @xcite , have shown that this far - from - equilibrium phase transition belongs to the same universality class as the equilibrium phase transition in the ising model in zero field .",
    "this is a quite remarkable result , as it extends the scope of an equilibrium universality class to a far - from equilibrium system .",
    "in this article we have presented numerical and theoretical results on magnetization reversal and hysteresis in models of magnetic nanoparticles and ultrathin films .",
    "models that were explicitly considered are kinetic ising and classical heisenberg models , which were studied by dynamic monte carlo simulations , and continuum - spin micromagnetics models , which were studied by finite - temperature langevin - equation methods .",
    "the simulation results were interpreted within the context of nucleation theory , and it was shown how the reversal modes change from single - droplet to multidroplet upon increasing the strength of the applied field or the size of the system .",
    "computer simulations of model systems such as those presented here enable one to study in detail the statistical properties of the reversal processes , as well as the time dependent internal magnetization structure .",
