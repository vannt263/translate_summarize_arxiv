    "the increasing observational evidences that the expansion of the universe is accelerating ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and reference therein ) has stimulated a rising interest to the reconstruction of its expansion history .",
    "an important outcome of these theoretical studies is to clarify the sensitivity of observational tests to dark energy properties and to assess how each could be corrupted by extra - noise from other cosmological effects .",
    "comprehensive investigations of these nuisances have been carried out on  standard \" tests , like snia , weak lensing , bao , cmb , isw or clusters of galaxies .",
    "in contrast , very few focussed on the time drift effect that changes the observed redshift of an object as function of time .",
    "the recent claim that it may drive the conceptual design of instrument for next generation giant telescopes raised the need that similar attention should be paid to the theoretical ground of this novel technique .",
    "interestingly , such an observation may lead to a better understanding of the physical origin of the recent acceleration  @xcite and to a determination of the dark energy equation of states  @xcite as well as constraints on dark energy models  @xcite or tests of the variation of fundamental constants  @xcite .",
    "as first pointed out by sandage  @xcite , in a homogeneous and isotropic spacetime , the time drift of the observed redshift is directly related to the hubble function by @xmath1 given the most likely ranges of cosmological parameter values derived from observations , in a @xmath2cdm model the typical amplitude of the redshift drift is of order @xmath3 on a time scale of @xmath4  yr , for a source at redshift @xmath5 .",
    "this corresponds to a spectroscopic tiny velocity shift , @xmath6 , of @xmath7 .",
    "[ amperror ] ( left panel ) shows the time drift as function of redshift for the standard @xmath2cdm model and a dark energy models with an equation of state changed by only 10% ( @xmath8 ) , all other parameters being kept constant .",

    "[ amperror ] ( right panel ) depicts this difference for two models with either @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "the feasibility of this measurement is most challenging and impossible with present - day astronomical facilities .",
    "however , it was recently revisited  @xcite in the context of the new generation of extremely large telescopes ( elt ) , arguing that with such outstanding collecting areas one could measure velocity shifts of order @xmath11 over a 10 year period from the observation of the lyman - alpha forest on qso absorption spectra . in particular",
    ", it is one of the main science driver to design the cosmic dynamics experiment ( codex ) spectrograph  @xcite for the future european elt ( e - elt ) .",
    "the performances of codex and its capability to measure a time drift of very distant objects were estimated using monte - carlo simulations of quasar absorption spectra .",
    "the expected velocity accuracy of this experiment can be written as follows ( see ref .",

    "@xmath13 denotes the signal - to - noise ratio , for a pixel scale of @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the number of quasars .",

    "this is within the reach of a codex instrument mounted on a @xmath18 meter elt by observing a 16.5@xmath19 magnitude qso during 2000 hrs  @xcite .",
    "many systematic effects that may spoil the time drift signal , such as earth rotation , proper motion of the source , relativistic corrections etc . , are discussed in ref .",
    "the acceleration of the sun in the galaxy seems more a serious problem because its amplitude may be of the same order than the cosmic signal .",
    "however , it has not been measured yet , so its nuisance is still unknown . on the other hand ,",
    "subtle contaminations like accelerations produced by large scale structures have never been estimated in the error budget .",

    ", it appears that , in the standard model of cosmology with a primordial spectrum of index @xmath57 , the amplitude of the potential fluctuations is ir divergent .",
    "however , since the previous calculation is only valid for sub - horizon modes , it is necessary to introduce a cut - off for modes typically beyond the hubble scale .",
    "the expected potential fluctuations then drop to more realistic amplitudes of @xmath58 .",

    "both terms have similar behaviour and are basically unchanged for any realistic flat cosmology having and effective @xmath78 close to @xmath79 , but note that this is _ a priori _ not the case for any model .",
    "assuming the cosmological time drift derived from qso absorption lines by the lyman - alpha forest may be contaminated by extra - acceleration of clouds by massive structures , it is legitimate to question the validity of the linear regime approximation used throughout this work .",
    "let us first consider the acceleration of an absorbing lyman - alpha cloud . on large scales , clouds are located inside filaments infalling towards massive clusters or super - clusters of galaxies .",
    "assume , then , the acceleration is due to the gravitational attraction of a super - cluster with typical mass of order @xmath80 , localized at 10  mpc from the cloud .",
    "the newtonian acceleration is about @xmath81 . in comparison ,",
    "the hubble acceleration @xmath82 is @xmath83 so that @xmath84 .",
    "this ratio may change by one order of magnitude , depending on the mass and length scales one may consider for clusters , super - clusters or filaments , but is always sufficiently small to keep the linear approximation valid .",
    "it is also worth noticing its amplitude is close to theoretical expectations derived in the previous section .",
    "we therefore speculate the simple interpretation of our theoretical estimate as being primarily due to the acceleration of the nearest rich cluster is pertinent . to confirm this and get more sophisticated description of accelerations",
    "the use of numerical simulations is indeed necessary . + in practice , a time drift is not measured from a single absorption line but by averaging several lines spread over a spectral range @xmath85 defined by the spectrograph .",
    "if the acceleration of lyman - alpha clouds is primarily driven by clusters of galaxies located around their neighborhood , then clouds are not dynamically independent and accelerations of closeby clouds are correlated .",
    "we are thus interested in the variance of @xmath20 , averaged over a bound comoving distance @xmath86 along the line of sight , @xmath87 it is related to the variance from correlations obtained on a single line by @xmath88 where the coefficient @xmath89 depends on the physical size over which the average is performed .",
    "@xmath90 is the redshift range explored by the spectrograph at the mean redshift @xmath91 : @xmath92 . for a @xmath2cdm universe",

    "@xmath95 can be computed from the correlation of the acceleration field , @xmath96 as @xmath97 where @xmath86 is the size of the comoving radial distance over which the average is performed .",
    "if we could naively split the lyman - alpha forest along a line if sight into radial bunches of physically decoupled cloud systems , without correlated accelerations , @xmath98 would provide an estimate of the number of bunches . from an observational point of view",
    ", @xmath98 expresses the effective number of absorption line systems without correlated acceleration probed by a spectrograph covering a wavelength range @xmath85 around the mean redshift @xmath91 .",
    "it increases when the spectral coverage of the spectrograph increases ( see fig .",
    "for example , if @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , that is @xmath101 ( see fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) respectively , then @xmath95 is 0.69 , 0.55 , and 0.38 , and @xmath102 2.1 , 3.3 and 6.9 .",
    "however , @xmath98 only takes into account one light of sight .",
    "if we average over @xmath15 randomly selected lines of sight , then we expect that @xmath103 hence , the spectral range of the spectrograph together with the number of lines of sight can easily drop the contribution of cosmological perturbation to the variance budget below a @xmath104 level .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the theoretical values of @xmath98 derived in the previous paragraph can easily be interpreted and predicted from simple physical arguments .",
    "the spectral range of a codex - like spectrograph as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , is @xmath105 . at a redshift of @xmath106",
    ", it corresponds to @xmath107 and to a comoving length of @xmath108  mpc .",
    "if we assume that the coherence scale of the velocity field is the typical size of the super - cluster ( @xmath10930  mpc ) , then codex can probe about 10 independent systems per line of sight .",
    "this is of the same order as @xmath110 for @xmath111 discussed above , which confirms its interpretation as an effective number of uncorrelated cloud systems .",
    "it also simply explains why @xmath112 , which is nothing but the inverse square root of this number .",
    "in order to measure the cosmological time drift of the redshift , many systematic effects will have to be understood .",
    "besides the systematic errors of astrophysical origin that may affect the observation of the lyman - alpha forest , large scale structures will induce a dispersion of @xmath20 .",
    "this work addresses this issue .",
    "first , we have derived the expression of the time drift of cosmological redshift at first order in the perturbation .",
    "this was then used to estimate its variance and then to demonstrate it depends on two main effects , the accelerations and the local gravitational potential at both the source and observer positions .",
    "the contributions at the observer position have not been discussed further .",
    "high precision astrometric observations with gaia will soon provide exquisite knowledge of the motion of the earth in the milky way .",
    "it will pinpoint all local acceleration terms with enough accuracy to remove this contribution easily  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the contributions at the source position are much more difficult to subtract . in the linear regime",
    ", we have shown that the gravitational potential contribution is negligible while the acceleration of the source is typically of the order of 1% at @xmath0 .",
    "we argue a dominant contribution to this term is the acceleration of galaxy clusters near the source .    in order to understand whether the amplitude of this variance can be reduced ,",
    "we have estimated the effect of averaging the signal over several absorption lines .",
    "one can either profit from the total spectral range covered by the spectrograph to measure the drift from all lines detected along a line of sight , provided correlated acceleration contributions are taken into account , or use the mean drift over many randomly selected lines of sight .",
    "the first option reduces the variance by the square root of the number of uncorrelated clouds systems along a line of sight , the second by the square root of the number of independent lines of sight . for an instrument having the current specifications of the codex spectrograph , it is then easy to drop the contribution of large - scale structures to the total variance of the time drift down to a 0.1% level .",
