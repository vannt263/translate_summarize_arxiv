    "observations of the temporal and spectral evolution of the non - thermal emission from the system provide a unique opportunity to probe the physics of the pulsar winds ( pw ) which is , in spite of the wealth of observational phenomena , and a 40-year old observation history , remains a matter of debate .",

    "rapid growth of the x - ray flux found in observations of 2004 is correlated with the rapid growth of the unpulsed radio emission from the system .",
    "the growth of radio and x - ray flux at these phases can be attributed to the pulsar entering the be star disk .    unfortunately , tev observations start somewhat later and it is not possible to see whether the tev flux grows during the pre - periastron disk crossing .",

    "taking into account that the seed photons for the ic scattering have energies of about 10  ev ( assuming the temperature of be star @xmath29  k ) , one can find that the ic emission from electrons of the energy @xmath61 peaks at @xmath62 ^ 2\\mbox { kev}\\ ] ] the energy of the upscattered photons becomes approximately equal to the energy of electrons at @xmath63 ( the transition to the klein - nishina regime ) . if the spectrum of electrons is a simple powerlaw with the spectral index @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) , the ic spectrum below and above the thompson  klein - nishina break is , respectively , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the ic emission in the 10 - 100  gev energy band is characterized by one more spectral feature .",

    "taking into account the coincidence of the cooling break energy with the energy of transition to the klein - nishina regime one can not expect to detect the conventional steepening of the ic spectrum above the cooling break because of the reduced efficiency of the ic scattering in the klein - nishina regime .",
    "one more complication of the detailed calculation of the ic emission spectrum in the gev - tev energy band is that in order to explain the observed behaviour of the tev lightcurve during the periastron passage within the ic model one has to assume that either additional non - radiative cooling mechanism dominates electron energy loss close to the periastron , or a cut - off in the electron spectrum at sub - tev energies is present @xcite .",
    "the combined effect of the above mentioned difficulties makes the detailed predictions for the ic spectrum in the gev - tev band quite uncertain and we do not attempt the detailed fit of the observed spectrum in this band .",
    "instead we concentrate of the attempt to fit the general shape of the spectral energy distribution in the x - ray to tev band within the ic model .",
    "[ fig : sec ] shows an example of the fit the the spectrum of  in ic model for x - ray to tev emission .",

    "it is clear that the overall shape of the ic spectrum in the kev to tev energy band agrees well with the data .",
    "the energy of the break in the electron spectrum ( @xmath74  mev ) is close to the energy of the coulomb break given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : coul ] ) . as it was discussed above , electrons with energies below @xmath55 loose all their energy via the severe coulomb loss before they are able to escape from the dense equatorial disk of",
    "be star to the less dense pwn . as a result ,",
    "regardless of the initial injection spectrum of electrons from the pw , the spectrum of electrons injected in the compact pwn has a low - energy cut - off at the energy @xmath75 .",
    "the ic cooling of electrons in the pwn leads to the formation of the characteristic powerlaw tail of electron distribution below @xmath55 with @xmath72 . the electron spectrum above the energy @xmath55 ( assumed to be a powerlaw with the spectral index @xmath76 in the model fit of fig .",
    "[ fig : sec ] ) is determined by the balance of acceleration and energy losses in the pulsar / stellar wind shock region .",
    "electrons responsible for the x - ray ic emission produce synchrotron radiation in radio band at the characteristic frequency @xmath77\\left[e_e/30\\mbox { mev}\\right]^2 \\mbox { ghz}\\ ] ] the ratio of the synchrotron to ic luminosity is given by the ratio of the energy densities of the magnetic field and radiation , @xmath78 ^ 2\\left[r_{\\rm pwn}/10^{13}\\mbox { cm}\\right]^2\\ ] ] the radio luminosity of the system is some 4 orders of magnitude lower than the x - ray luminosity .",
    "this imposes a restriction on the possible strength of magnetic field in the x - ray emission region , @xmath79^{-1}\\mbox { g}\\ ] ] in the model fit of fig .",
    "[ fig : sec ] we have chosen the magnetic field strength @xmath80  g and assumed the size of x - ray / radio emission region @xmath81  cm .",
    "the ic model for the kev - to - tev spectrum has a difficulty to explain the observed correlation of the radio , x - ray and tev emission because the cooling and escape times of electrons emitting ic radiation in x - ray and tev bands are different .",
    "since the non - pulsed radio emission from the system is most probably related to the passage of the pulsar through the disk of be star , an explanation of the observed correlation requires a physical mechanism which would explain the increase of the tev flux during the disk passage .",
    "at least two mechanisms of interaction of the pulsar wind with the be star disk can lead to the increase of tev emission : bremsstrahlung and proton - proton interactions .",
    "as it is discussed above , the bremsstrahlung cooling time in the dense be star disk ( [ eq : brems ] ) can be comparable to the ic cooling time both for the highest energy electrons above tev and for electrons with energies below 1  gev ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tic ] ) , ( [ eq : tickn ] ) ) .",
    "the bremsstrahlung cooling time can be comparable to the escape time from the compact equatorial disk so that up to 10% of the power of the pulsar wind can be emitted in the form of bremsstrahlung radiation .",
    "[ fig : brems ] shows the fit for the @xmath32-ray spectrum of the system with a combination of ic and bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "the electron spectrum is supposed to be a cut - off powerlaw with the spectral index @xmath82 and cut - off energy @xmath83  tev .",
    "note that the egret upper limit imposes a restriction on the spectrum of electrons because the bremsstrahlung spectrum has the photon index @xmath84 .",
    "assuming that the electron spectrum continues to lower energies without a break would violate the egret bound on the flux .",
    "a break at the energy @xmath85  mev was assumed in the electron spectrum in the model fit of fig .",
    "[ fig : brems ] .",
    "the break at this particular energy is naturally expected in the bremsstrahlung scenario , because below this energy the ionization loss dominates over the bremsstrahlung loss , which leads to the hardening of the electron spectrum by @xmath86 at low energies .",
    "if the pulsar wind is proton - loaded , interactions of the pulsar wind protons with the protons from the dense be star disk provide an additional source the tev  emission . as is is discussed above , the ``  efficiency '' of @xmath56 interactions is a factor of several lower than that of bremsstrahlung , but the relative contributions of bremsstrahlung and @xmath56 interactions into the  emission depend on the proton - to - electron ratio of the pw .",
    "if the pulsar wind is mostly proton loaded , the @xmath59 decay emission can dominate over the @xmath32-ray emission from the pulsar wind electrons .",
    "an example of the fit to the tev spectrum within the @xmath56 model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp ] . we have assumed a powerlaw spectrum of protons with the spectral index @xmath87 for the model fit .",
    "similarly to the case of bremsstrahlung , the egret upper limit on the flux imposes a restriction on the spectrum of the protons at several gev energies .",
    "however , contrary to the bremsstrahlung case , the spectrum of @xmath59 decays emission has a low energy cut off below gev energy and the restriction on the spectrum of the protons is rather weak .",
    "in fact , in the model fit of fig . [",
    "fig : pp ] the proton spectrum is described by a single powerlaw from gev to tev energies .",
    "it is important to note that in this case the luminosity of the source in the 10  gev energy band is higher than in the tev band .     model .",
    "emission is produced via neutral pion decays ( red line ) while radio and x - ray emission are , respectively , synchrotron and ic radiation from electrons / positrons produced in the charged pion decays . ]",
    "if bremsstrahlung or pion decay emission dominate the tev flux , the tev luminosity is just proportional to the density of the be star disk at the location of the pulsar .",
    "this means that in this case the parameters of the gaussian that approximately fits the tev lightcurve ( fig .",
    "[ gauss ] ) should be identified with the equatorial plane position ( @xmath8 ) and width ( @xmath16 ) of the disk . within such interpretation",
    "the disk appears to be `` thick '' and the calculation of the phases of disappearance / reappearance of the pulsed emission has to be done by calculating the column density of the disk along the line of sight for different positions of the pulsar .",
    "fixing the phases of disappearance / reappearance of the pulsed emission to the known values , one can obtain a constraint on the radial density profile of the disk and/or inclination of the disk w.r.t . the line of sight .",
    "however , if inverse compton emission gives a contribution comparable to the pion decay or bremsstrahlung , the derivation of the disk parameters from the shape of the tev lightcurve is not possible .",
    "the most important feature of the model with @xmath56 interactions is that it can explain the broad band spectrum of the system from radio to tev energy band .",
    "the idea is that the synchrotron and ic emission from the secondary electrons produced in the decays on charged pions is emitted in the radio and x - ray bands , respectively , while the bremsstrahlung emission from the secondary electrons , emitted in the @xmath32-ray band gives a sub - dominant contribution , compared to the @xmath59 decay emission .",
    "[ fig : pp ] shows an example of the fit to the broad band spectrum of the system within the @xmath56 interactions model . since the emission in radio , x - ray and tev bands is produced via one and the same process ( @xmath56 interactions ) ,",
    "the observed correlation of the radio , x - ray and tev flux is naturally explained .",
    "besides , the observed hardening of the x - ray spectrum during a several - day period following the moment of the entrance of the pulsar to the disk of be star is explained by the low energy cut - off at @xmath74  mev in the spectrum of secondary electrons .",
    "such a cut off arises ( a ) because of the kinematics of the pion decays and ( b ) because of the efficient coulomb cooling of electrons with energies below 100  mev during the escape from the be star disk .",
    "the @xmath56 interaction scenario is attractive because of one more reason : in this model the overall energy balance of the system is evident .",
    "indeed , in the `` purely electronic '' models it is not clear why the system is `` radiatively inefficient '' : the spin - down luminosity of the pulsar is @xmath88  erg / s , but the bolometric luminosity is just @xmath89  erg / s , which accounts for no more than one percent of the spin - down luminosity . to the contrary , within `` protonic '' model one has to assume that proton - loaded pw carries a significant fraction of the spin - down power . as it is explained above , in the @xmath56 model",
    "the efficiency of conversion of the power contained in the protons into the @xmath32-ray emission is several percents , ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : pp_eff ] ) ) which explains the luminosity @xmath90 erg / s .",
    "the @xmath56 model can be readily tested with the future observations of the system in the 10  gev energy band with _",
    "glast_. indeed , from fig .",
    "[ fig : pp ] one can see that in the @xmath56 model the egret upper limit on the flux at 10  gev should be close to the actual level of the @xmath32-ray flux from the system .",
    "this means that the detection of the system during the periastron passage with a more sensitive instrument , like glast should not be a problem ."
