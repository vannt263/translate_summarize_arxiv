    "the lattice boltzmann method ( lbm ) is a discrete velocity method primarily used in the numerical simulation of complex fluid problems .",
    "the essence of the method is that a finite number of populations stream and collide on a fixed computational lattice in such a manner that their populations velocity moments obey the navier  stokes equations .",
    "there are a number of ways to derive the method  @xcite .",
    "historically , the method comes from lattice gas automata theory but it can also be derived directly by the overrelaxation discretization of boltzmann s kinetic transport equation .",
    "we prefer to describe the lbm without direct reference to boltzmann s equation .",
    "indeed , we prefer to describe the lbm as being generated wholly by the mechanical motion , of a single - particle distribution function , by free - flight and entropic involution . in this",
    "setting , the lbm is the discrete dynamical system which arises by discretizing this motion in a particular manner .",
    "the discrete velocity set arises as approximation nodes of certain cubature in velocity space  @xcite , where these nodes are automorphisms of some underlying lattice .",
    "a consequence of this realisation is that the stability analysis ( and analysis of conservation laws ) of the lbm is more natural .",
    "one is able to clearly identify the main instability mechanisms of the lbm ( sect .",
    "[ sec2 ] ) , which are triggered when the continuous mechanical motion of free - flight and entopic involution is discretized .    a further consequence of viewing the lbm in this setting ( also in sect .  [ sec2",
    "] ) is that a prescription of coupled steps is suggested to stabilise the method . after proceeding for one step of the usual overrelaxation lbm scheme ( lbgk ) ,",
    "populations are streamed and then replaced with their local equilibrium distribution .",
    "additional dissipation results but the scheme retains the second - order in time accuracy of lbgk . compared with the standard lbm , the proposed scheme of coupled steps constitutes no additional computational cost .",
    "each cubature rule gives rise to its own lbm , and multispeed lattice schemes can be readily concocted ( sect .",
    "[ sec3b ] ) .",
    "multispeed lattices are an attractive prospect because they promise greater flexibility in the attainable sound speed provided by the model , allow for the modelling of nonisothermic flows and the dynamics of higher moments as well .",
    "the literature sometimes contains statements whose sentiment is that some multispeed lattice lbm schemes are inherently numerically unstable ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . on the contrary ,",
    "we observe that the aforementioned lbm of coupled steps is stable for a variety of multispeed lattices and we demonstrate this through the numerical simulation of a one - dimensional isothermal shock tube ( sect .  [ sec4 ] ) .",
    "to describe the lbm as being generated by free - flight and entropic involution requires a certain amount of background knowledge and terminology which we now briefly introduce . for proofs and further justification of any statements ,",
    "the reader should consult  @xcite .",
    "the free - flight equation is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a single - particle distribution function , @xmath2 is the space vector , @xmath3 is velocity .",
    "this equation preserves the value of a strictly concave entropy functional , @xmath4 .",
    "the default choice of entropy is @xmath5    in addition , we have a fixed linear mapping @xmath6 to some macroscopic variables . for example , in hydrodynamic applications @xmath7 is the vector of five hydrodynamic fields ( @xmath8,@xmath9,@xmath10 ) ( density  momentum  energy ) : @xmath11    for each @xmath7 , the _ quasiequilibrium state _",

    ", a corresponding quasiequilibrium state @xmath20 is defined .",
    "the set of all quasiequilibrium states is parameterised by the macroscopic variables , @xmath7 , and defines the _ quasiequilibrium manifold _ , which we denote by @xmath21 .",
    "the quasiequilibrium approximation for the free - flight equation   is the following evolution equation for the macroscopic variables @xmath22 for the hydrodynamics fields   the system   is the compressible euler equations .",
    "we denote by @xmath23 the projector of a point @xmath19 onto @xmath21 : @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath25 be the time shift transformation for the free - flight equation  : @xmath26 .",

    "now , the _ partial entropic involution _",

    "the point @xmath51 , @xmath47 , is closer to the quasiequilibrium point @xmath52 ( with respect to entropy ) than @xmath53 .    if @xmath54 , then , after some initial steps , the following sequence gives a second - order in time step @xmath27 approximation of the compressible navier ",

    "finally , to generate the standard lbm we must perform three tasks :    1 .",

    "transfer from space to a lattice , where these velocities are automorphisms ; 3 .",
    "transfer from dynamics and involution on @xmath34 to the whole space of states .",

    "[ sec3a ] and sect .",

    "there are a number of sources of instability which are triggered when the operator @xmath61 is replaced with @xmath62  .",
    "indeed , we identify three main instability mechanisms .",
    "firstly , a small shift in @xmath19 in the direction of the vector @xmath63 does not relax back for @xmath49 , and its relaxation is very slow for @xmath64 ( i.e. , for small viscosity ) .",
    "this effect is most easily illustrated by fig .",
    "[ nstab ] , where a perturbed chain of entropic involutions is shown .",
    "this instability , which we refer to as _ neutral instability _",
    ", causes one step oscillations to be triggered .",
    "neutral stability and one - step oscillations in a sequence successive entropic involutions .",
    "bold dotted line  a perturbed motion , @xmath65  direction of neutral stability.[fig1],width=264,height=132 ]    secondly , there is a _ nonlinear instability _ due to the nonlinear nature of the projector @xmath23 .",
    "more specifically , for all of the accuracy estimates in the previous section , we implicitly use the assumption that @xmath19 is sufficiently close to @xmath21 .",
    "the sequences   and   give the same accuracy as one another , but a long chain of steps with the linearised operator @xmath62   can lead far from the quasiequilibrium manifold @xmath21 and even from @xmath34 itself .    finally , there is a _ directional instability _ that can affect accuracy .",
    "there can be large deviation in the angle the vector @xmath63 makes with the tangent space to @xmath34 .",
    "the directional instability changes the structure of dissipation terms in the target macroscopic equations : accuracy is decreased to the first - order in @xmath27 and significant fluctuations of the prandtl number and viscosity coefficient may occur .      there is a strikingly simple prescription that simultaneously alleviates the effect of all three instabilities identified in the previous section .",
    "consider starting from a point @xmath66 , then evolve the state by @xmath67 and apply the operator @xmath68  , as is usual .",
    "then , evolve by @xmath67 again and project back on to @xmath21 using @xmath23 : @xmath69 this _ coupled step _ with quasiequilibrium ends is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ coupledstep ] and gives a second - order in time @xmath27 approximation , to the shift in time @xmath58 , for the target macroscopic equations with @xmath70 , @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "the procedure of periodically restarting from the quasiequilibrium manifold introduces additional dissipation of order @xmath72 , and the perturbation of accuracy is of order @xmath73 .",
    "hence , the method has the second - order accuracy .",
    "the user should take into account that @xmath74 significantly depends on the chain construction .",
    "for the sequence   we have @xmath75 , and for the sequence of steps we have @xmath70 .",
    "the viscosity coefficient is proportional to @xmath74 .",
    "if @xmath76 is small , the coupled step   gives around two times larger viscosity than  .",
    "the scheme of coupled steps with quasiequilibrium ends  .[fig2],width=264,height=132 ]    the result of restarting from @xmath21 is that the aforementioned neutral instability is obliterated and the effects of nonlinear and directional instabilities are entirely marginalised .",
    "many specific forms of entropy for lbms have been discussed in the literature .",
    "there exist two methods of construction : from the boltzmann entropy approximation to equilibrium ( for given macroscopic variables ) , and from the equilibrium approximation to the boltzmann entropy approximation . for the latter ,",
    "the universal entropy formula for a discrete distribution @xmath77 is the kullback entropy @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the quasiequilibrium distribution parameterised by @xmath7 .",
    "it is trivial to check that @xmath80 .",
    "the entropic involution conserves the values of all elements of @xmath7 .",
    "hence , for energy conservation it is sufficient to have energy inside @xmath7 ( the distributions @xmath19 and @xmath20 should have the same energy ) . in this sense",
    ", the long standing problem of energy conservation in lbms has an obvious and physically meaningful solution ( see an example of such a solution in  @xcite ) .",
    "the classical physical sense of   is a nonequilibrium extension of a massieu ",
    "kramers function ( or grand canonical potential ) for a given set of macroscopic variables @xmath7 .",
    "a constructive approach to choose discrete @xmath81 and @xmath12 is : we use the classical ( continuous ) quasi - equilibrium distributions and cubature rules to get the appropriate discrete approximation . then , the entropy that we need for self - consistency of our construction is given by  .",
    "to complete the realisation of the lbm , configuration space is discretized by selecting a finite number of velocities @xmath82 . more specifically , for a fixed time step @xmath27 , the space discretization will consist of a lattice @xmath83 for which the velocities @xmath84 are automorphisms .",
    "choosing to discretize in this manner means that no spatial discretization error is committed when the continuous free - flight equations @xmath85 are integrated for time @xmath27 and evaluated on @xmath83 . here",
    ", @xmath86 denotes a single - particle distribution function associated with the velocity @xmath87 .",
    "note that all of the discretization error is contained in the selection of the discrete velocities .    for hydrodynamics",
    "it remains to evaluate the integral moments  . by construction ,",
    "the integrals   remain unchanged under the substitution of @xmath19 with the quasiequilibrium state @xmath12  .",
    "our approach will be to construct cubature rules based upon reproduction of low degree polynomials using the discrete velocities , @xmath87 , as abscissas .",
    "we replace the quasiequilibrium state   with its second - order taylor expansion in @xmath88 with terms involving @xmath89 and higher disregarded .",
    "we denote this polynomial by @xmath90 , and demand that its first few moments are evaluated exactly by the cubature rule .",
    "another approach , which we do not pursue here , is to employ a discrete version of the entropy   from the outset ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "let us concern ourselves with modelling the isothermal navier ",
    "stokes equations for the remainder of the paper and set @xmath91 .",
    "the `` sound speed '' of the model is @xmath92 where @xmath93 . for the isothermal model we should at least consider all moments up to the third - order , which is equivalent to finding the cubature weights @xmath94 such that @xmath95 for @xmath96 . using this cubature ,",
    "the discrete hydrodynamic moments are given by the expressions @xmath97 where @xmath98 .",

    "the prescribed scheme of coupled steps   is : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the cumulative number of time steps taken in the simulation .",
    "clearly , each set @xmath103 of velocities and associated cubature weights will define its own lbm .    one way to handle",
    "the multivariate case is to use tensor and algebraic products of one - dimensional velocities and weights , respectively .",
    "let us therefore restrict our discussion to one space dimension .",
    "one particular choice of quadrature is gauss  hermite quadrature . indeed , the three - point gauss  hermite rule ( which exactly evaluates the fifth order moment ) is popular  @xcite .",
    "however , the use of multispeed lattices ( lattices with more then two non - zero speeds in one - dimension ) using higher - order gauss ",
    "hermite quadrature is precluded because the zeros of the hermite polynomials , for degree greater than @xmath104 , can not be aligned with any regular lattice .",
    "an alternative to gauss ",
    "hermite is to use newton  cotes quadrature which has the advantage that the velocities can be aligned with a lattice before determining the quadrature weights .",

    "the scheme quickly becomes meaningless . in comparison , we find that the proposed scheme of coupled steps   gives stable behaviour on all tested lattices , by which we mean no blow - up and spurious post - shock oscillations are observed . in all cases",
    "we do observe a small deviation near the shock front which may be an unavoidable gibbs effect .",

    "by considering a realisation in which the lbm is wholly generated by free - flight and entropic involution , we have suggested a simple stabilisation procedure of coupled steps   which retains the second - order accuracy of the method without artificial viscosity at that order .",
    "the procedure effectively constitutes no additional computational cost and can be implemented in any existing lbm code with just a few changes .",
    "we have demonstrated that the oscillatory pattern of the lbm in the vicinity of shocks is not due to a lack of artificial diffusivity and are not pertinent to proper lattice boltzmann schemes . on the other hand",
    ", there exists a gibbs effect that we can not fully suppress without artificial viscosity or special ad hoc approximation schemes .",
    "the role of gauss  hermite quadratures in lbm constructions is now overestimated ( here we fully agree with  @xcite ) .",
    "other quadratures require slightly more points for the same degree of accuracy , but can be realised on integer nodes ( and , more generally , are flexible with regards to the choice of nodes ) , which is more convenient for lbm needs .",

    "finally , with the advent of stable multispeed lattice formulations comes the prospect of stable nonisothermic lbm realisations .",
