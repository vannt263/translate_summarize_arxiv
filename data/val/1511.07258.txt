    "the standard evolutionary paradigm for cvs proposes that as these systems evolve to shorter and shorter periods , they eventually reach a period minimum somewhere between 70 and 80 minutes ( kolb & baraffe 1999 , howell et al .",

    "wz sge is short period cv that exhibits infrequent , but large amplitude dwarf novae outbursts ( patterson et al .",

    "we attempted to use a cross - correlation technique using the l2 dwarf kelu 1 ( obtained from the irtf spectral libraryspex / irtf_spectral_library/ ] ; cushing 2005 ) , as our template .",
    "unfortunately , that effort was unsuccessful .",
    "we next decided to doppler - correct the entire data set until these continuum features were at their sharpest .",

    "this amount of `` dilution '' is consistent with that found in the light curve modeling of wz sge by harrison et al .",
    "( 2013 ) .      in the mean of the full data set",
    ", the first overtone co feature in wz sge certainly appears to be much weaker than that seen in kelu 1 .",
    "as noted in harrison et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , light curve modeling indicates irradiation of the donor star near @xmath26 = 0.5 . in fig .",
    "[ ldwarf ] we also plot a portion of the doppler - corrected data set centered on @xmath26 = 0.0 .",
    "the co features are considerably stronger at inferior conjunction perhaps partly due to the lack of irradiation at this phase , but mostly due to the dramatic decrease in the dilution from the partial eclipse of the accretion disk and hotspot .",
    "the light curve modeling in harrison et al .",
    "( 2013 ) can provide insight on the level of irradiation . in their ellipsoidal models , the secondary minimum ( @xmath26 = 0.5 ) in the model @xmath0-band light curve ( their fig .",
    "12 ) is 0.2 mag less deep than it would be if there was no irradiation .",
    "if there is no irradiation , and the secondary dominated the @xmath0-band luminosity , the secondary minimum would be slightly deeper than the primary minimum ( c.f .",
    "14 in harrison & campbell 2015 ) .",
    "thus , if the secondary minimum is weaker than the primary minimum , it is an indication of irradiation .",
    "the change in temperature required to create the observed 0.2 mag difference , however , is very small ( @xmath195% ) .",
    "this is insufficient to significantly change the spectral type of the donor and thus alter the strength of the co feature .",
    "we believe that there are two plausible scenarios that might explain why the co absorption feature in the donor is especially weak near @xmath26 = 0.5 .",
    "the first is that the co emission appears to be strongest at this phase . if one compares the entire set of co emission features they are all strongest at this phase .",
    "why does this happen ?",
    "it could be that irradiation from the hotspot is suppressing co emission from nearby regions in the accretion disk .",
    "since the hotspot leads the secondary by @xmath330.05 , if there is a decrease of co emission near the hotspot , the red wing of the co emission features on the receding side of the disk near the hotspot would be diminished , and the blue wing would be lessened on the approaching part of its orbit . near phase 0.5 , there would be no significant affect , and the profiles would be at their strongest , and most symmetric .",
    "the morphology of the co emission features shown in fig .",
    "2 are certainly consistent with this scenario .",
    "note also that the center of the first overtone emission feature suggests that it is slightly redshifted at phase 0.5 , and that the red wing of the same feature is weaker at phase 0 .",
    "the small offset in phase of the hotspot certainly could explain the changing morphologies of the emission features .",
    "this phasing offset would also produce an asymmetric irradiation of the secondary star . there might be evidence for this in the infrared light curves of wz sge .",
    "there is a weak excess in the @xmath0-band and @xmath34 irac 4.5 @xmath24 m bandpass light curves of wz sge at @xmath26 = 0.7 ( vs. 0.2 ) , suggesting a tiny bit of additional irradiation of the hemisphere facing the observer at this time .",
    "this amount of irradiation appears to be much too small , however , to impart a significant change on the spectral properties of the secondary .",
    "secondly , it might be possible for the hotspot to obscure the secondary near superior conjunction . as noted by a number of authors",
    "( see mason et al . 2000 and references therein ) , the hotspot in wz sge has considerable optical depth .",
    "if we assume this remains true in the @xmath0-band , and that the hotspot has sufficient vertical extent , it might be able to obscure a small portion of the secondary star near @xmath26 = 0.5 .",
    "the @xmath0-band light curve in harrison et al .",
    "( 2013 ) does show a sharper than expected secondary minimum .",
    "the presence of strong co emission and a small amount of obscuration could combine to create the weaker than expected co absorption features near superior conjunction .",
    "we can attempt to model the depth of the co absorption feature seen in the medianed full data set by adding a co emission spectrum to the l2 data following the procedure used in harrison & hamilton ( 2015 , see their fig .",
    "21 ) . in the case of wz sge",
    ", there is the expectation that the co features will have a double - peaked profile similar to the h i and he i lines .",
    "since it is impossible to know the exact splitting a priori , we model several cases .",
    "the two peaks of the h i lines ( see fig . 1 ) are separated by 105  .",
    "if the co emission comes from an outer , cooler region of the disk , the splitting should be less than this .",
    "a single gaussian fit to the co@xmath2 feature leads to an estimate of the velocity broadening of @xmath19 1300 km s@xmath5 . in fig .",
    "[ cocomp ] , we have added a co emission line spectrum with this amount of velocity broadening to the irtf spectrum of kelu 1 .",
    "next we add two velocity - broadened co emission spectra shifted by @xmath4 25   ( total @xmath35  ) to the l2 dwarf spectrum , and plot it just below the single co emission line spectrum .",
    "below that is a co emission spectrum also shifted by @xmath4 25  , but with each emission component broadened by 650 km s@xmath5 . as shown in harrison & hamilton ( 2015 ) , as the gaussian profile of the co emission narrows , the observed depth of the co feature decreases due to the emission feature contributing more flux into the deepest parts of the absorption bandhead of the secondary star .",
    "note that at this velocity , the blue wing does not match the observations . below this spectrum in fig .",
    "[ cocomp ] we plot the sum of a co emission spectrum and the l2 dwarf where the separation between the two peaks is @xmath36 = @xmath4 50  , and below that , one with @xmath4 75   separation . at a velocity broadening of 1300 km",
    "s@xmath5 , splittings of @xmath11 @xmath4 50    are too small to actually affect the co emission profile .",
    "as we move to larger shifts between the co emission peaks , the bandhead minima absorb the peak of the redshifted emission components .",
    "the sum result of this modeling process is that we can reproduce the observed co absorption feature , and that the two peaks of the co feature must be shifted by less than @xmath36 = @xmath4 50  .",
    "unfortunately , the large and uncertain velocity broadening does not allow us to put useful constraints on the location of the co emission region .",
    "as shown in harrison & hamilton ( 2015 ) , carbon is highly deficient in the long period cvs ss cyg , ru peg , and gk per ( and by inference , the numerous other cvs with weak co features seen in the @xmath0-band spectroscopic surveys of harrison et al . 2004b , 2005 ) .",
    "in contrast , hamilton et al . (",
    "2011 ) found that the secondary stars in several cvs with short orbital periods similar to that of wz sge appeared to have normal co absorption strengths .",
