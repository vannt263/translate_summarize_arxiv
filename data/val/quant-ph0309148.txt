    "entanglement is a fragile feature of composite quantum systems that can easily diminish by uncontrollable interactions with the environment . at the same time",
    "however carefully crafted entangled states can protect quantum coherence from the deleterious effects of those random interactions .",
    "this idea underlies the principles of quantum error correcting codes that strengthen the optimism regarding the feasibility of implementing in practice complex quantum information processing tasks @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate how quantum entanglement can help in the task of classical communication . to this end",
    ", we develop a simple model of a noisy communication channel , where the noise affecting consecutive transmissions is correlated . within this model ,",
    "we derive bounds on the classical channel capacity assuming either separable or entangled input states , and we show that using collective entangled states of transmitted particles leads to an enhanced capacity of the channel .",
    "the motivation for our model comes from classical fiber optic communications @xcite . in practice ,",
    "light transmitted through a fiber optic link undergoes a random change of polarization induced by the birefringence of the fiber .",
    "the fiber birefringence usually fluctuates depending on the environmental conditions such as temperature and mechanical strain . at first sight , this makes the polarization degree of freedom unsuitable for encoding information , as the input polarization state gets scrambled on average to a completely mixed state .",
    "however , the birefringence fluctuations have a certain time constant which means that the transformation of the polarization state , though random , remains nearly the same on short time scales .",
    "consider now sending a pair of photons whose temporal separation lies well within this time scale .",
    "although the polarization state of each one of the photons when looked at separately becomes randomized , certain properties of the joint state remain preserved .",
    "for example , this is the case of the relative polarization of the second photon with respect to the first one .",
    "we can therefore try to decode from the output whether the input polarizations were mutually parallel or orthogonal .",
    "this property can not be determined perfectly , as in general we can not tell whether two general quantum states are identical or orthogonal if we do not know anything else about them @xcite , but even the ability of providing a partial answer establishes correlations between the channel input and output that can be used to encode information into the polarization degree of freedom . the situation becomes even more interesting when we allow for entangled quantum states .",
    "then the singlet polarization state of the two photons , when sent as the input , remains invariant under such perfectly correlated depolarization , and it can be discriminated unambiguously against the triplet subspace .",
    "therefore we can encode one bit of information into the polarization state of two photons by sending either a singlet state or any of the triplet states .",
    "we shall see that these simple observations will also emerge from our general analysis of the channel capacity .",
    "the first example of entanglement - enhanced information transmission over a quantum channel with correlated noise has been recently analyzed by macchiavello and palma @xcite .",
    "our model assumes a different form of correlations , and its high degree of symmetries has allowed us to perform optimization of the channel capacity over arbitrary input ensembles .",
    "although we analyze only zero- and one - photon signals , we define the action of the channel in terms of the transformations of the bosonic annihilation operators , which sets up a framework for possible generalizations , such as use of multiphoton signals .",
    "this application of entanglement in classical communication is a distinct problem from entanglement - assisted classical capacity of noisy quantum channels studied by bennett _",
    "_ in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it has been shown that prior entanglement shared between sender and receiver can increase the classical capacity .",
    "we also note that the non - zero time constant of phase and polarization fluctuations can be used in robust protocols for long - haul quantum key distribution @xcite .    before passing on to a detailed discussion of the problem in the subsequent sections ,",
    "let us introduce some basic notation .",
    "the action of a channel is described by a completely positive map @xcite that we will denote by @xmath0 .",
    "the sender selects messages from an input ensemble @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the probability of sending the state @xmath3 through the channel .",
    "the capacity of the channel is a function of the mutual information between the input ensemble and measurement outcomes at the receiving stations : it characterizes the strength of correlations between these two that are preserved by the channel .",
    "the mutual information itself involves a specific measurement scheme ; however , it has a very useful upper bound in the form of the holevo quantity that depends only on the output ensemble of states @xmath4 emerging from the channel @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the von neumann entropy @xmath7 .",
    "as we will see , in our model the holevo quantity will provide a tight bound on the mutual information that could be achieved in practice using a simple measurement scheme .",
    "the classical channel capacity is obtained by assuming arbitrarily long sequences of possibly entangled input systems , and calculating the average capacity per single use of the channel . in our analysis",
    ", we will perform a restricted optimization by considering only two consecutive uses of the channel .",
    "we will start our discussion by proving a rather general lemma about channels that can be decomposed into a direct sum of maps acting on subspaces of the hilbert space of the input systems . in physical terms ,",
    "such channels remove quantum coherence between the components of the input state that belong to different subspaces , by zeroing the respective off - diagonal blocks of the density matrix characterizing the input state .",
    "this lemma will greatly simplify our further calculations .",
    "_ lemma 1 : _ suppose that we can decompose the hilbert space @xmath8 of the system into a direct sum of subspaces @xmath9 such that for an arbitrary input state @xmath10 the state emerging from the channel @xmath11 can be represented as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the input state @xmath10 truncated to the subspace @xmath14 , and each @xmath15 is a certain trace - preserving completely positive map acting in the corresponding subspace @xmath16 .",
    "then the optimal channel capacity can be attained with an ensemble in which each state belongs to one of the subspaces @xmath16 .    _",
    "proof : _ indeed , suppose that there is a state @xmath10 that does not satisfy the above condition , i.e.  it is defined on more that one subspace @xmath16",
    ". we can replace it by a sub - ensemble @xmath17 , obtained by truncating the state @xmath10 to the subspaces @xmath16 and normalizing the resulting density matrices .",
    "in other words , whenever the sender is supposed to transmit @xmath10 , she replaces it by one of the normalized truncated states @xmath18 with the corresponding probability @xmath19 .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that the average state obtained from such a subensemble is identical with @xmath11 .",
    "the above observation has a useful consequence when optimizing the holevo bound on channel capacity .",
    "if the input ensemble is of the form discussed above , then it can be split into subensembles of states that belong to separate subspaces @xmath16 , with the probability distributions normalized to one within each subensemble , and @xmath20 denoting the probability of sending a state from the @xmath21th subensemble .",
    "it is then easy to check that the holevo quantity is given by the following expression : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the holevo quantity for the @xmath21th subensemble .",
    "therefore , the maximization of the holevo quantity can be performed in two steps .",
    "the first one is the optimization of each of @xmath23 separately , assuming an input ensemble restricted to the subspace @xmath16 .",
    "the second step consists of optimizing the probability distribution @xmath20 with the normalization constraint @xmath24 , and it can be performed explicitly using the method of lagrange multipliers .",
    "indeed , if we denote the lagrange multiplier as @xmath25 , then differentiation over @xmath26 yields : @xmath27 this formula allows us to express the probabilities @xmath26 in terms of the lagrange multiplier @xmath25 as : @xmath28 and furthermore summation over @xmath29 and using the fact that @xmath30 gives the value of the lagrange multiplier as : @xmath31 finally , inserting eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pl ] ) and ( [ eq : mu ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi = sumpkchik ] ) yields the maximum value of the holevo quantity equal to : @xmath32 we will later find this expression useful in calculating the channel capacity in our model .",
    "the physical reason for this is that we will be able to decompose the set of states used for communication into subensembles with a fixed number of photons , and then optimize the holevo quantity separately in each subspace .",
    "let us now introduce a mathematical model for the random transformation of polarization during transmission through the channel .",
    "a general linear transformation between two annihilation operators corresponding to a pair of orthogonal modes is given by @xmath33 unitary matrices @xcite that form the lie group u(2 ) . in situations",
    "when only the relative phase between the two polarization modes is relevant , the overall phase of the transformation can be assumed to be fixed , which reduces the group of transformations to su(2 ) .",
    "however , in our case the overall phase shift can vary between the consecutive temporal slots , and therefore we need to keep it as an independent parameter .",
    "we note that any u(2 ) matrix can be mapped onto a rotation in the three dimensional physical space .",
    "such a rotation describes the corresponding transformation of the poincar sphere used to represent the polarization state of light in classical optics @xcite .",
    "we will label elements of u(2 ) as @xmath34 and use a dot to denote the multiplication within the group .",
    "the u(2 ) group has a natural invariant integration measure which we assume is normalized to one @xmath35 .",
    "this measure defines a uniformly randomized distribution of polarization transformations that scrambles an arbitrary input polarization to a completely mixed one .",
    "suppose now that two consecutive temporal slots labelled by @xmath36 and @xmath37 , each comprising two orthogonal polarizations , are occupied by a joint state of radiation @xmath38 , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : tempslots ] .",
    "we will assume that the polarization transformation @xmath39 affecting the slot @xmath36 is completely random , but that the transformation @xmath40 is correlated with the first one through a conditional probability distribution @xmath41 .",
    "the resulting transformation of the joint two - slot state is therefore given by the following completely positive map : @xmath42 here @xmath43 is a unitary matrix acting in the hilbert space of one of the slots that represents the polarization transformation @xmath34 .",
    "we will now assume that the conditional probability @xmath44 depends only on the relative transformation between the slots @xmath36 and @xmath37 and that it can consequently be represented as @xmath45 .",
    "in such a case , we can substitute the integration variables in the second integral according to @xmath46 , and make use of the invariance of the integration measure @xmath47 .",
    "this procedure shows that the map @xmath48 can be represented as a composition of two maps : @xmath49 . the first one of them , @xmath50 , acts on both the temporal slots and it depolarizes them in exactly the same way : @xmath51 the second map , @xmath52 , acts only on the slot @xmath37 , and it introduces additional depolarization relative to the slot @xmath36 according to the probability distribution @xmath53 : @xmath54 we will assume later that the distribution @xmath53 has sufficient symmetry to describe the action of the map @xmath52 in the relevant hilbert space with the help of two simple parameters .",
    "we now introduce a further simplification by imposing a condition that each temporal slot may contain at most one photon .",
    "therefore the relevant hilbert space for each slot is spanned by three states : the zero - photon state @xmath55 , and horizontally and vertically polarized one - photon states @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we can conveniently write the explicit form of the unitary transformation @xmath43 using the irreducible unitary representations of the group su(2 ) .",
    "we will denote by @xmath58 a @xmath59 matrix that is a @xmath60-dimensional representation of an su(2 ) element obtained from @xmath34 by fixing the overall phase factor to one .",
    "these matrices are well known in the quantum theory of angular momentum as describing transformations of a spin-@xmath61 particle under the rotation group @xcite .",
    "we will also denote by @xmath62 the overall phase of the element @xmath34 .",
    "then the unitary transformation of the input state corresponding to the polarization rotation @xmath34 is given by the matrix : @xmath63 in this formula , the one - dimensional representation @xmath64 is identically equal to one , and @xmath65 is a @xmath33 unitary matrix itself ; however , we will keep this more general notation in order to be able to use results from the theory of group representations .",
    "in particular , the following property of the rotation matrix elements will allow us to evaluate directly a number of expressions : @xmath66^{\\ast } { \\cal d}^{j'}_{m'n'}({\\bf\\omega } ) = \\frac{1}{2j+1 } \\delta_{jj ' } \\delta_{mm ' } \\delta_{nn'}.\\ ] ]    the action of the map @xmath50 on a joint two - slot state can be analyzed most easily if we decompose the complete hilbert space into a direct sum of subspaces with a fixed number of photons : @xmath67 , where the upper index labels the number of photons .",
    "the zero - photon subspace is spanned by a single state @xmath68 .",
    "the one - photon space has a basis formed by four vectors : @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "finally , in the two - photon subspace @xmath73 we will introduce a basis that consists of the singlet state @xmath74 and the three triplet states @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "the reason for this choice is that then the action of the tensor product @xmath78 on a two - photon state can be decomposed into the sum : @xmath79 where @xmath80 acts on the singlet state @xmath81 , and @xmath82 is a three - dimensional matrix acting in the triplet subspace .",
    "using our decomposition of the complete hilbert space , the action of the tensor product @xmath83 on a general two - slot state in the basis specified above is given by :    @xmath84    if we now insert this fomula into eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambdaperf ] ) , it can be easily seen that the invariant integration over the overall phase factor @xmath62 kills all the off - block diagonal elements of the density matrix that link different subspaces @xmath16 . in other words ,",
    "all the coherence between states with different photon numbers is completely removed by the phase fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , the operation @xmath52 , acting only on the second slot , does not mix subspaces with different photon numbers . therefore the conditions of our lemma are satisfied and we can consider only states with a definite number of photons as elements of the input ensemble .",
    "thus we need to calculate are three corresponding holevo quantities @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 that can be combined into a holevo bound for the overall channel capacity according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : chisum ] ) .",
    "this calculation forms the contents of the next section .",
    "the communication capacity @xmath85 of the zero - photon subspace itself @xmath88 is naturally zero , as we have only a single state @xmath89 at our disposal .",
    "this state can of course be used as an element of a larger ensemble thus contributing to the overall capacity .",
    "this fact is reflected in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : chisum ] ) , where @xmath90 indeed does increase the total value of @xmath91 .",
    "a less trivial problem to calculate is the capacity of the one - photon subspace . if we assume a normalized input state @xmath92 from the subspace @xmath93 , then the action of the channel @xmath50 restricted to this subspace is given by : @xmath94 where the parameters @xmath95 and @xmath96 are defined in terms if the input density matrix as : @xmath97 for the form of density matrix given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda(1)perfrhoin ] ) , the depolarizing channel @xmath52 affects only the off - diagonal elements @xmath96 and @xmath98 .",
    "we will assume that the symmetry of the distribution @xmath53 is such that the effect of @xmath52 is a rescaling of these elements by a real parameter @xmath99 bounded between @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "it is now easy to check that the entropy of the one - photon state emerging from the channel can be written as @xmath102 where the @xmath33 matrix appearing in the second term can be interpreted as a state of a qubit .",
    "therefore , the second term is bounded by @xmath100 and @xmath101 , and consequently @xmath103 .",
    "it is a straightforward observation that the holevo quantity is bound from above by the difference between the maximum and the minimum possible entropies of states emerging from the channel .",
    "therefore we obtain that @xmath104 .",
    "this inequality can be saturated simply by taking a one - photon state confined either to the first or to the second temporal slot , with an arbitrary polarization .",
    "thus , the channel capacity is not enhanced in the one - photon sector .",
    "the most interesting regime is when both the temporal slots are occupied by photons . as we will see below , in this case quantum correlations",
    "can then enhance the capacity of the channel .",
    "if we take a normalized input state @xmath92 from the two - photon subspace @xmath73 , then the map @xmath50 produces a werner state @xcite : @xmath105 where we have introduced the following notation : @xmath106 and we will use for @xmath107 the name of the werner parameter of the input state @xmath92 , defined as : @xmath108 ) .",

    "we will assume that the action of the map @xmath52 acting on the photon in the second temporal slot is simply isotropic depolarization shrinking the length of the bloch vector by a factor @xmath110 satisfying @xmath111 .",
    "such an operation preserves the werner form of the transmitted state , and its only effect is the multiplication of the parameter @xmath107 by the factor @xmath110 .",

    "we note that the measurement discriminating between the singlet and the triplet subspaces can be implemented using the braunstein - mann scheme based on linear optics @xcite , as we do not have to distinguish between all four bell states . after overlapping temporally the received photons and interfering them on a 50:50 non - polarizing beam splitter",
    ", their detection in the same output port corresponds to a projection onto the triplet subspace , whereas measuring them in the separate output ports of the beam splitter identifies the singlet state .",
    "we have introduced a model of a communication channel with correlated noise motivated by random birefringence fluctuations in a fiber optic link . within this model , we have demonstrated that introducing quantum correlations between consecutive uses of the channel increases its capacity .",

    "making use of entanglement requires more complex preparation procedures that provide joint input states extending over a number of temporal slots .",
    "a related question is the role of collective quantum measurements on the output of the channel rather than detecting radiation in each of the slots individually and combining classical outcomes of separate measurements .",
    "the action of the channel has been defined in terms of transformations of the bosonic field operators .",
    "this opens up a route towards interesting generalizations of the present work , for example including arbitrary multiphoton states .",
    "another direction would be extending the model to an arbitrary number of temporal slots rather than just allowing for correlations between pairs of consecutive slots as in our example .",
    "it is easy to give a simple protocol showing that in this case the channel capacity can be enhanced even further .",
    "suppose that the sender generates a train of zero- and one - photon states with the same probabilities equal to one half .",
    "the first time she is to transmit a photon , she sends half of maximally entangled pair . in the second instance when a one photon should be transmitted",
    ", she sends the remaining member of the pair transforming it in such a way that the joint two - photon polarization state belongs either to the singlet or the triplet subspace .",
    "the receiver implements a polarization - independent quantum non - demolition measurement on each temporal slot .",
    "when a photon is detected , it needs to be stored until the arrival of the second member of a pair , when the discrimination between the singlet and the triplet subspaces can be performed with the help of a joint measurement .",
    "if the fluctuations in random birefringence can be neglected over the temporal separation between the photons in a pair , this procedure allows one to encode one extra bit of information into each pair of transmitted photons .",
