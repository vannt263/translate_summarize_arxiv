    "the study of the dynamic behavior of elastic media in the presence of different static potentials has been center of attention in the recent years .",
    "superconducting vortices are almost ideal systems for the study of the phenomenology of these systems because relevant properties such as density , interactions and external force can be easily controlled .",
    "much work has been done on the problem of moving vortex systems .",
    "depending on the velocity and type of static potential it is expected to arise different dynamical phases . in the elastic regime ,",
    "giarmarchi and le doussal@xcite have predicted the existence of a moving - bragg - glass phase for high driving currents and a weak disordered static potential . this is a phase free of dislocations , with a power law decay of the positional correlations which are anisotropic with respect to flow direction . on another hand , balents , marchetti and radzihovsky@xcite",
    "have argued for the existence of a smectic phase . in this phase , vortices move along well defined static channels , holding correlation perpendicular to the channels , but uncorrelated along them . on increasing disorder plastic motion",
    "is expected close to the depinning force showing a mixture of moving and fixed vortices@xcite . in the later case",
    "the vortex motion is also through meandered static flow patterns .",
    "a common expected feature of all these dynamical states is the anisotropic response of the moving structure to perturbations parallel or perpendicular to the vortex motion .",
    "a number of experimental works have been done investigating these phenomena .",
    "transport measurements report changes in the dynamical properties of the vortex matter close to the peak effect @xcite that were attributed to a crossover from plastic to ordered motion .",
    "more recently kokubo and coworkers@xcite have proven this dynamical ordering from mode locking experiments .",
    "snapshots of moving vortex structures have been obtained in decoration experiments@xcite that have shown evidence for these smectic and moving glass phases of vortices .",
    "however one of the most striking properties of these quasi - ordered driven phases is the existence of barriers to a small force transverse to the direction of motion .",
    "these barriers would originate an effective transverse critical current@xcite or a change in the hall noise spectrum@xcite .",
    "although the numerical results present a clear evidence of these effects the experimental confirmation is evasive .",
    "recently lefebvre , hilke and altounian@xcite have shown transport measurements in superconducting metallic amorphous tapes that reveal the existence of a transverse critical current although these results show big quantitative discrepancies with numerical simulations .",
    "mutual inductance techniques have proven to be a valuable tool for measuring superconducting characteristics of two dimensional systems@xcite . in previous works",
    "it was shown that a variation of this technique based in special shaped coils is capable of detecting the anisotropic character of dynamical phases@xcite . in this work",
    "we extend these susceptibility measurements to mo@xmath2ge@xmath1 amorphous films that reveal the anisotropic characteristic of dynamical vortex phases .",
    "this technique allows the measurement of susceptibility and transport at the same time obtaining susceptibility information with applied current to the sample .",
    "mutual inductance measurements were performed using planar serpentine coils of geometry similar to those described in a previous paper@xcite .",
    "it was showed that the implementation of rectangular coils with high aspect ratio allow the direct measurement of the anisotropy .",
    "shielding currents are induced in the sample by the primary coils and therefore they are predominantly parallel to the long side of the coil , as it is shown in figure  1d . as a consequence",
    "the voltage generated in the reception coil is originated by the sample currents flowing in that direction .",
    "for the experiments reported in this work the coils were batch fabricated on silicon substrates and later the superconducting film was deposited on top of them .",
    "coils with different geometries have been build using 0.5 micron thick aluminum as conducting material and sio@xmath3 as insulator .",
    "the fabrication process started from a 8 \" silicon wafer covered with 650 nm of low stress silicon nitrate .",
    "aluminum wiring of the primary coil was defined by optical lithography and lift - off .",
    "deposition of sio@xmath3 by chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) with a nominal thickness of @xmath4 m was used as a first isolation layer . a second lithography step , with the same mask used previously but rotated 180 degrees defined the secondary coil .",
    "a final sio@xmath3 @xmath4 m layer was deposited to provide a second isolation layer between the coils and the superconducting film .",
    "a planarization with a chemical mechanical polishing ( cpm ) was performed afterward .",
    "finally vias in the sio@xmath3 were defined by lithography and hf etching to allow direct bonding of au wires to each coil . in figure  1a",
    "we show a photograph of one of the microfabricated coils .",
    "all the results presented in this work correspond to coils with al wires of @xmath5 m in width separated by @xmath6 m and with 30 turns .    on top of the coils the superconducting mo@xmath2ge@xmath1 500",
    "nm amorphous films were deposited by rf ",
    "sputtering at room temperature by water cooling of the sample holder .",
    "a cross shaped geometry was defined in the superconducting film by lithography and lift - off which allow the dc current injection in the film parallel and perpendicular to the coil direction . in figure  1b we show photograph of the sample and a scheme of the electrical contacts .",
    "figure  1c presents a sketch of the experimental configuration .",
    "the critical temperature of the films determined as the onset of resistance at zero magnetic field was @xmath7 .",
    "the field and temperature dependence of the susceptibility were acquired for different applied currents to the sample for both directions : current parallel ( @xmath8 direction ) and perpendicular ( @xmath9 direction ) to the long strips of the coils . the voltage drop in the film",
    "was simultaneously measured using a nanovoltmeter that allows the detection of the vortex motion induced by the external current .",
    "the protocol utilized was the following : for a fixed external applied field the temperature of the sample was varied and regulated at fixed setpoints .",
    "for each of these temperature steps the current in the sample was swept in magnitude and orientation while the susceptibility and voltage drop in the sample were acquired .",
    "all measurements presented here were performed in the linear regime of the susceptibility and for a driving frequency and amplitude of @xmath10 khz and @xmath11 ma , respectively .",
    "the principal result of this paper is represented in figure  2 where the susceptibility of the sample is plotted as a function of temperature , on measuring it with an electrical current through the sample for the two current orientations and an applied magnetic field perpendicular to the film . in the following",
    "we define @xmath12 as the susceptibility data taken where the bias current is parallel to the long side of the coils ( * @xmath13 * , @xmath8 direction ) , and @xmath14 where the bias current on the sample is perpendicular to them ( * @xmath15 * , @xmath9 direction).the data indicate that once the vortex motion is induced by the external current the response obtained for currents parallel and perpendicular to the coils are notably different . at currents lower than",
    "0.1 ma the magnetic response is the same to both currents orientation .",
    "thus , this magnetic response can be taken as the reference response , @xmath16 . at currents greater than 0.1 ma",
    "the shielding capability , @xmath17 , is lower in the case where the external current is parallel to the long side of the coils respect to the perpendicular configuration . a lower value of the @xmath17 data is an indication of an increase in the vortex mobility .",
    "taking into account that the shielding currents induced in the sample basically mimic the geometry of the primary coil @xcite , the parallel configuration corresponds to the case that these shielding and external currents are collinear .",
    "this means that when the bias current is parallel to the long side of the coils the _ dc _ force and the alternate testing force generated by the currents induced in the sample by the primary coil are almost collinear . as a consequence",
    ", the results of these experiments are evidencing that the vortex mobility is greater along the vortex motion direction than perpendicular to it .",
    "an isotropic response is recovered at high temperatures where the data for both current orientations merge together and with that taken at zero current on the sample .",
    "the observed anisotropy occurs in a region where the susceptibility of reference @xmath16 indicates an increase in the shielding capability . in figure 2",
    "we can see this increment from t@xmath187.73k , which is an evidence of the peak effect@xcite where the vortex ensemble softens to accommodate to the weak pinning potential increasing the critical current .",
    "and @xmath14 fits to the reference @xmath19 fit ( green and purple line respectively ) showing the first three phases found . ]    in figure 3 we plot the susceptibility data for fixed temperature and magnetic field as a function of applied external current in the sample for both current orientations .",
    "the temperature , @xmath20 was chosen as that where the susceptibility of reference ( @xmath21 ) is minimum ( peak of the peak effect ) , see figure 2 .",
    "it is clear that the anisotropic response persists in the whole range of currents investigated . at this temperature and field the longitudinal response ( or parallel configuration ) reaches a steady state for current values around 3.5 ma .",
    "we were nt able to detect this saturation in the perpendicular configuration up to 5 ma , the maximum current up to which we were able to measure without overheating the sample .",
    "this effect ( difference between parallel and perpendicular directions ) could be in principle explained by an intrinsic anisotropy of the sample .",
    "however this can be discarded after observing that i ",
    "v characteristics coincide for both current directions .    , indicated with an arrow in figure  2 . ]",
    "more insight of the anisotropic behavior can be extracted from the analysis of the data through a subtraction of the susceptibility at a given current to a reference measurement at zero current for both current orientations , see top panel of figure  2 . based on this figure ( and equivalent for other biasing currents )",
    ", we were able to construct the i ",
    "t phase diagram shown in figure  4 . at low temperatures the susceptibility for both current directions coincides with the measurement at zero applied current .",
    "this region i corresponds to the response of a fully pinned vortex lattice . at certain value of the external current we observe that the susceptibility measured when the current direction is along the coils long direction starts to deviate from the zero current behavior but not for the measurement in the perpendicular configuration .",
    "this result indicates that the sample is in a regime ( region ii ) that the vortex ensemble started to move and is locked to move in the perpendicular direction proving the existence of a finite transverse critical current .",
    "rising temperature the perpendicular susceptibility becomes different from the zero current measurement but with greater shielding capability than in the parallel measurement ( region iii ) .",
    "these results imply that this is a region of the phase diagram where the dynamical vortex structure has an anisotropic mobility . at even higher temperatures and currents an isotropic response",
    "is recovered where all susceptibilities coincide ( region iv ) before reaching the normal state region ( v ) .",
    "region iv could be assigned as a moving vortex liquid phase where pinning becomes negligible on the vortex dynamics .    , @xmath22 .",
    "region ii : transversally pinned state , @xmath23 .",
    "region iii : anisotropic dynamical state , @xmath24 .",
    "region iv : isotropic moving phase : @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "region v : normal state .",
    "the phase diagram is relevant only for currents above @xmath27 ma , the minimum applied current for which anisotropy is detected . ]",
    "our results clearly indicate that the response of the moving vortex lattice in @xmath28-moge have an anisotropic characteristic in the region close to the depinning transition .",
    "our results show the existence of two different regimes of anisotropic behavior . at lower temperatures",
    "there is a finite response in the @xmath8 direction and the response in the perpendicular direction is current independent .",
    "this is a region where there is a transverse critical current .",
    "rising temperature and/or the magnitude of the current , the perpendicular component _ becomes depinned _ but the response is still anisotropic .",
    "this anisotropic behavior coincides in the phase diagram where the peak effect in the critical current is observed .",
