    "a significant goal of plasma physics research is the characterization of mass , momentum , and energy transport in a wide variety of complex systems . in particular ,",
    "the question of what mechanisms mediate the transfer of energy between turbulent fields and distributions of plasma particles , leading to the eventual damping and dissipation of turbulence , is open .",
    "one system which displays turbulent behavior is the solar wind , a hot , diffuse emanation from the sun s surface that fills the heliosphere . while lacking the precise control over conditions afforded in a laboratory setting , the large volume of in situ measurements of the solar wind over the last half century has led to the accrual of observations of turbulence with a wide variety of plasma parameters .",
    "such measurements have proven useful to the study of phenomena in magnetized turbulence.@xcite    a limitation of these in situ observations is that they are taken at a single - point in space at a given time .",
    "this raises at least two significant complications ; one must disentangle the dynamics associated with spatial and temporal variation , and track the evolution of spatially integrated quantities , such as the energy content of a field or distribution of charged particles , given only single - point measurements .",
    "the first of these complications is addressed by invoking taylor s hypothesis,@xcite the conjecture that for single - point measurements of sufficiently fast flows , the time evolution is essentially frozen and the measurement traces out the spatial structure of the turbulence ; a review of the application of taylor s hypothesis to solar wind observations can be found in klein et al 2014.@xcite    to address the second complication of inaccessible spatially integrated quantities , one may consider the dynamics of the phase - space energy density rather than the total energy . a technique has been recently proposed to measure the local - in - phase - space energy transfer between fields and plasma distributions using single - point time series of simple plasma systems.@xcite by correlating the product of the electric field and velocity derivative of the particle distribution measured at a single point in space , the velocity structure of the transfer of energy between fields and particles is obtained . by averaging this correlation over a selected time interval , the oscillatory energy transfer between the fields and particles is removed , leaving only the secular energy transfer .",
    "the mechanisms responsible for this energy transfer can be identified by the velocity space structure of the field - particle correlation .",
    "initial work applied this correlation to systems that damp via the landau resonance.@xcite here , we consider the transfer of energy in linearly unstable systems , and show that field - particle correlations are able to identify the presence of both fluid and kinetic instabilities in such systems .",

    ", we see that there does not exist a single value of @xmath53 for which the oscillatory energy transfer is completely removed .",
    "this due to the fact that the system supports both a weakly damped langmuir wave as well as a finite - frequency unstable acoustic mode .",
    "correlating over the langmuir period retains some of the acoustic oscillations , while correlating over the acoustic period retains some of the langmuir oscillations .",

    "we are able to address the question of where the energy transfer occurs in phase space , and use the structure of this energy transfer to characterize the nature of the underlying instability .        for the stable , counter - streaming electron case , run 1",

    "we note that the resonant structure is maintained for other choices of @xmath53 , including an interval corresponding to the langmuir wave period , not shown .",
    "the velocity - integrated correlation confirms that the core population has a net gain of energy , and as expected for this instability , we see that the electrons that receive the energy are near the resonant velocities .",
