    "star forming regions are often interpreted in a picture that consists of an ensemble of discrete regions of gas .",
    "existence of these au - scale condensations in the clumps of the molecular clouds , may be a motivation to investigate the hierarchy down - up structure of the clouds .",
    "various authors , such as kwan  ( 1997 ) and silk & takahashi  ( 1997 ) , have cited coagulation processes as an origin for the form of the initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "for example , murray & lin  ( 1996 ) have argued that in protoglobular clusters , gas is fragmented onto sub - jeans - mass clumps by a variety of hydrodynamical instabilities , and that eventual star formation ensues when enough clumps have merged to form jeans unstable objects .",
    "pringle et al .  ( 2001 ) have considered a similar process in the assembly of giant molecular clouds in the spiral arms of disc galaxies .",
    "thus , the condensations appear , as a possible scenario , to be precursors of large - scale cores ( dense cores with significant jeans mass ) via merging and collisions ; they constitute the initial conditions for star formation .",
    "this idea is largely an attempt to characterize the observed structure of molecular cloud complexes- see , e.g. the review by williams et al .",
    "( 2000)- but is likely to be applicable in many situations .",
    "it is well known that molecular clouds are turbulent which triggers the formation of structures .",
    "a recent literature has suggested that the clumpiness in clouds arises naturally from their formation through thermal instability , which acts on time - scales that can be much shorter than the duration of the turbulent motions .",
    "this suggests that molecular clouds may be already fragmented when they form ( koyama & inutsuka  2002 , audit & hennebelle  2005 , heitsch et al .",

    "we make the assumption that the molecular cloud is initially an uniform ensemble which then fragments due to thermal instability .",

    "they propose a mechanism based on magnetic tension to explain the thermal collapse in a magnetized flow and argue that the magnetic intensity in the wnm and in the cnm should not be very different .",
    "the effect of alfvn waves on thermal instability was studied by hennebelle & passot  ( 2006 ) .",
    "inoue et al .  ( 2007 ) performed one - dimensional two - fluid numerical simulations that describe the neutral and ionized components in the interstellar medium with purely transverse magnetic fields .",

    "  4 allocates to a gathering summary with conclusion .",
    "we consider the evolution of a plane - parallel self - gravitating magnetized slab of lightly ionized molecular gas ( see , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . in this geometry ,",
    "all variables are functions of distance @xmath16 to the central plane and time @xmath17 only .",
    "the magnetic field is frozen only to the ions , so that diffusion of the field relative to the neutral gas must continuously insert a drag force ( per unit volume ) @xmath18 where @xmath19 represents the collision drag coefficient and @xmath20 is the ion density . in ionization equilibrium state @xmath21 and @xmath22 is valid , and @xmath23 represents a deviation from equilibrium state ( shu  1992 ) .",
    "the drift velocity is given by @xmath24 which is obtained by assumption that the pressure and gravitational force on the charged fluid component are negligible compared to the lorentz force because of the low ionization fraction .",
    "in this way , the magnetic fields are directly evolved by charged fluid component , as follows : @xmath25    since the ion density is negligible in comparison to the neutral density , the mass conservation is given by @xmath26 the momentum equation then becomes @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the isothermal sound speed and the gravitational acceleration @xmath29 obeys the poisson s equation @xmath30    following the many previous treatments , a further simplification is possible if we introduce the surface density between mid - plane and @xmath31 as @xmath32 the usual defined surface density from @xmath33 to @xmath34 has twice the value of @xmath35 . by transformation from @xmath36 to @xmath37 , @xmath38 the drift velocity is @xmath39 and the equation ( [ magcon ] ) becomes @xmath40 with the above , field equation ( [ poisson ] ) can be integrated to give @xmath41 while the equation of continuity ( [ mascon ] ) and the equation of motion ( [ momcon ] ) take the form @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively . the slab is assumed to be in quasi - magnetohydrostatic equilibrium at all time , supported against its own self - gravity by the magnetic nd gas pressure .",
    "the loss of flux from ambipolar diffusion is exactly compensated for by the compression of the slab which is necessary to maintain equilibrium . in this approximation ,",
    "the left - hand side of equation ( [ momcon2 ] ) is zero , and we may integrate the force balance to obtain @xmath44 where integration constant @xmath45 is the value of @xmath35 at @xmath46 ( where @xmath47 is zero ) .    in a sense , our goal is to obtain the variation of drift velocity as a function of density at initial time .",
    "evolution of the slab is beyond the scope of this paper . for this purpose",
    ", we follow the work of shu  ( 1983 ) to introduce the non - dimension quantities @xmath48 so that we rewrite the basic equations ( [ magcon2 ] ) , ( [ mascon2 ] ) and ( [ momcon3 ] ) as follows : @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 in this way , a natural family of initial states is generated by assuming that the initial ratio of magnetic to gas pressure is everywhere a constant , @xmath52 , i.e. , @xmath53 at @xmath54 .",
    "then one finds from equations ( [ momcon4 ] ) , ( [ mascon4 ] ) and ( [ drift2 ] ) that @xmath55 @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the central density of the slab at @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is a length - scale parameter .    the interior magnetic field of a molecular cloud acts only on the ions and electrons , so that the tendency for the field lines to straighten out is impeded by collisions of charged particles with the neutral particles .",
    "a simple physical derivation of the ambipolar drift heating rate ( @xmath60 ) is given by considering the drag force ( [ dforce ] ) as follows @xmath61 substituting the equations ( [ dens ] ) and ( [ drift3 ] ) into equation ( [ heatad ] ) , the ambipolar drift heating rate of a molecular slab is given by @xmath62 which can be compared to the heating of cosmic rays ( e.g. , goldsmith  2001 ) , @xmath63 as follows ( @xmath21 ) @xmath64 that is shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] for typical values of @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "we have chosen to plot the density profile ( [ dens ] ) , because this makes it easy to compare the relative magnitude of ambipolar drift heating at different regions of the slab . since the drift velocity is inversely proportional to the density ( e.g. , eq.[drift3 ] ) , it is clear that the ambipolar drift heating rate is predominated in the outer regions of the slab .",
    "it would also be interesting to derive a rough estimate of heating due to the drift induced by turbulent motions and to compare its order of magnitude with the heating of cosmic rays .",
    "following black  ( 1987 ) the turbulence dissipation heating rate can be estimated as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the turbulent velocity and @xmath70 is the dissipation length scale . with @xmath71 and @xmath72 , we calculate @xmath73 , comparable to half of the heating rate of cosmic rays ( i.e. , eq .  [ heatcr ] ) .",
    "the cooling rate for molecular gas that is used in this work is based on the `` standard abundances '' adopted by g01 .",
    "i will briefly review here the important aspects of its construction .",
    "calculation of thermal balance in molecular clouds by goldsmith & langer  ( 1978 ) , neufeld et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and g01 have shown that the various isotopic variants of the carbon mooxide molecule are certainly important coolants at high densities ( i.e. @xmath74 ) .",
    "this is because the transitions that contribute to the cooling are thermalized due to the combination of higher collision rate and radiative trapping .",
    "the `` standard abundances '' for @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 was adopted by g01 based on the observational data equal to @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 relative to that of @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "neutral carbon is an important coolant since although it has only two fine structure transitions available , they have modest energies , and the abundance of this atom is relatively large .",
    "the fractional abundances of ortho and para water vapor in molecular clouds are surprisingly low , so that g01 adopted a number density of ortho-@xmath82 relative to that of @xmath81 equal to @xmath83 .",
    "he have also doubled the ortho-@xmath82 cooling rate to account approximately for contribution of para-@xmath82 .",
    "there is a large number of molecular species , including @xmath9 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 , that have low fractional abundances . to simplify the cooling calculation , g01 proposed the @xmath85 molecule as representative and multiplied its cooling by a factor of @xmath6 to include the contribution of the other species in this category .",
    "the velocity field in molecular clouds is not well understood in detail .",
    "we can assume that the large velocity gradient approximation is valid for the radiative transfer calculations necessary to compute the molecular cooling when the optical depths are not small .",
    "a critical input to the large velocity gradient calculation is the molecular abundance per unit velocity gradient , which is equivalent to the column density per unit line width .",
    "comparing the sizes and line widths for many clouds gives a characteristic value of @xmath89 that was used by g01 .",
    "the use of the large velocity gradient model introduces some uncertainty , but , do not significantly alter the total cooling rate .    in this way",
    ", the total cooling has a complicated dependence on the temperature and density of molecular hydrogen , parameterized by g01 as @xmath90 where @xmath91 and the values of @xmath92 and @xmath93 are given in table  1 for standard abundances and velocity gradient of @xmath94 . here",
    ", we use the polynomial fitting functions as follows @xmath95 @xmath96 where @xmath97 .",
    "another expression for the parameter @xmath98 is @xmath99 which was used by nejad - asghar & ghanbari  ( 2003 , 2006 ) and slh , for linear investigation of thermal instability in a narrow range of density . in this formalism , the approximate values of @xmath100 and @xmath101 between neighbor densities are given in table  1 .",
    "there is observational evidences that a variety of molecular species are depleted on the surface of dust grains ( e.g. , tielen & whittet  1997 ) .",
    "the observational results on depletion of different species are relatively limited and are certainly compromised by blending of emission from different regions along the line of sight .",
    "it is quite difficult to know exactly how the column densities or abundances of species observed on dust grain surfaces are related to the abundances in the gas phase .",
    "there also have not been systematic studies of the depletion of a wide range of molecular species in a set of sources . in this way ,",
    "g01 used the fragmentary data from a selection of clouds to analyze the effects of molecular depletion on the standard values of the cooling function parameters @xmath92 and @xmath102 .",
    "because of the above mentioned uncertainties , we should treat the cooling function in a parametric fashion with @xmath92 and @xmath102 approximately near the standard values of table  1 .",
    "the cooling function was constructed assuming that statistical steady - state equilibrium is valid , so that the chemical times are very short with respect to dynamical and cooling times .",
    "for all of the trace coolants this is reasonable except @xmath81 molecule that the collision time ( time to reach statistical steady - state equilibrium ) is necessarily of order the cooling time ( gilden  1984 ) .",
    "the @xmath81 is the main coolant at higher temperatures ( the temperature where the carbon monoxide and @xmath81 contribute equally is slowly increasing function of density ) . at the very low temperatures of interest considered by g01 in the molecular clouds ,",
    "@xmath81 do not play a significant role as a major coolant because of its low - lying energy levels .",
    "thus , the standard values of the cooling function parameters @xmath92 and @xmath102 ( as mentioned in table  1 ) based on the statistical steady - state equilibrium are approximately appropriate for our analysis .",
    "models of the molecular clouds identify several different heating mechanisms . here , we use the heating of cosmic ray ( [ heatcr ] ) and the ion - neutral slip heating rate as described by equation ( [ adtocr ] ) . the isobaric instability mode in a thermal equilibrium gas can be discussed in relation to the two - phase model in the same way as described in figure  3 of gilden  ( 1984 ) .",

    "[ fig3 ] shows the equilibrium state without magnetic field ( i.e. , @xmath108 ) in comparison with considering of the ambipolar drift heating rate with @xmath109 .",
    "this figure suggests that without ambipolar diffusion friction , there would not be isobaric thermal instability .",
    "this is not what has been found by gilden  ( 1984 ) , because as we known the thermal instability is very sensitive to the net cooling function .",
    "here we use the approximately most accurate cooling function which is evaluated by g0 .",
    "an equilibrium state is specified by the intersection of a thermal equilibrium curve and a constant pressure line .",
    "the two curves in fig .  [ fig3 ]",
    "display that considering of ambipolar drift heating rate causes to bifurcate the slab into two phases , with individual gas elements going into that phase corresponding to the sign of the initial fluctuation",

    "this range of values should be compared to equation ( 10 ) of nejad - asghar & ghanbari  ( 2006 ) , where @xmath115 was used .",
    "the heating due to ion - neutral friction is spatially dependent ( because it depends on gas density and gas density varies with position ) .",

    "depending on the chosen density range , the values of @xmath126 and @xmath101 can differ , but we can only expect the isobaric thermal instability mode . the isentropic regime can not be fulfilled in the molecular slab .",
    "therefore , we only consider the nonlinear isobaric thermal instability mode .",
    "to give a complete description of the nonlinear thermal runaway , one needs to solve the nonlinear fluid equations .",
    "the energy equation follows from the use of the first law of thermodynamics , that is @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the polytropic index , @xmath129 is the net cooling function @xmath130 and the pressure @xmath131 is given by the ideal gas equation of state @xmath132 where @xmath15 is the mean atomic mass per particle and @xmath133 is the universal gas constant .",

    "<S> the frictional heating by ion - neutral drift is calculated and its effect on isobaric thermal instability is carried out . </S>",
    "<S> ambipolar drift heating of one - dimensional self - gravitating magnetized molecular slab is used under the assumptions of quasi - magnetohydrostatic and local ionization equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> we see that ambipolar drift heating is inversely proportional to density and its value in some regions of the slab can be significantly larger than the average heating rates of cosmic rays and turbulent motions . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that the isobaric thermal instability can occur in some regions of the slab ; therefore it may produce the slab fragmentation and formation of the au - scale condensations . </S>"
