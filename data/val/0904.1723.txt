    "quantum correlations can be used to identify and study interesting quantum phases and regimes in ultracold atomic systems .",
    "recent experimental advances include detection of the mott insulator phase of bosonic  @xcite and fermionic   @xcite atoms in optical lattices , production of correlated atom pairs in spontaneous four - wave mixing of two colliding bose - einstein condensates  @xcite , studies of dephasing @xcite and interference distribution functions @xcite in coherently split one - dimensional ( 1d ) atomic quasicondensates ( qc ) , observation of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition  @xcite in two - dimensional ( 2d ) quasicondensates  @xcite , and hanbury - brown - twiss correlation measurements for nondegenerate ( nd ) metastable @xmath0he @xcite and @xmath1he atoms  @xcite , bosonic  @xcite and fermionic  @xcite atoms in optical lattices , and in atom lasers  @xcite .",
    "in one - dimensional atomic gases  @xcite , in situ measurements of correlations have been attained by means of photoassociation spectroscopy @xcite or by measuring the three - body inelastic decay @xcite , using the proportionality of the corresponding rates to the zero - distance two - particle and three - particle correlation functions , respectively @xcite .",
    "recently it was demonstrated that one can detect single neutral atoms in a tight trap or guide  @xcite .",
    "however , direct ( not inferred from any kind of atomic loss rate  @xcite ) observation of interatomic correlations at short distances in trapped ultracold atomic gases is hindered in many cases by either the finite spatial resolution of the optical detection technique or the very low detection efficiency of the scanning electron microscope  @xcite .",
    "therefore one needs to release ultracold atoms from the trap , diluting the atomic cloud in the course of expansion .    in this paper",
    "we address the question of how the correlations in the low - dimensional system evolve during the time - of - flight expansion , and discuss how the density variations in the time - of - flight images relate to the properties of the original trapped quantum gas .",
    "these `` density ripples '' in the expanding gas reflect the original thermal or quantum phase fluctuations existing in the cloud under confinement .",
    "such phase fluctuations are already present in three - dimensional ( 3d ) bose - condensed clouds under an external confinement with large aspect ratio  @xcite .",
    "their effect on density ripples of expanding clouds has been observed  @xcite , but quantitative analysis of such experiments was complicated since one had to take into account interactions in the course of expansion .",
    "however , for sufficiently strong transverse confinement reached in current experiments with low - dimensional gases ( chemical potential of the order of the transverse confinement frequency ) , the gas expands rapidly in the transverse direction so interactions during the expansion stage can be safely neglected .",
    "then one can develop a simple analytical theory , which directly relates the spectrum of the density ripples after the expansion to the correlation functions of the original fluctuating condensates .",
    "similar question has been considered for 3d clouds expanding in the gravitational field but only for noninteracting atoms  @xcite .",
    "we also note the density ripples we discuss are different from the density modulations which appear due to interactions during expansion and have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "we consider one- or two - dimensional atomic gases released from a tight trap formed by a scalar potential as realized on atom chips or in optical lattice experiments .",
    "we consider the situation when free expansion takes place in all three dimensions .",
    "this should be contrasted to the expansion of such a gas inside a waveguide @xcite , with the transverse confinement being permanently maintained . in the latter case ,",
    "the nonlinear atomic coupling constant g_1d= 2_a_s , where @xmath2 is the transverse trapping frequency and @xmath3 is the atomic @xmath4-wave scattering length , remains the same . while a bosonic gas rarifies during such expansion , collisions remain important .",
    "for example , in the 1d case dynamics asymptotically reaches the limiting tonks - girardeau ( tg )  @xcite regime of impenetrable bosons . in our case , if the fundamental frequency of the potential of the transverse confinement is much larger than the initial chemical potential of the atoms , the expansion in the transverse directions is determined mainly by the kinetic energy stored in the initial localized state of the transverse motion .",
    "interatomic collisions play almost no role in the expansion .",
    "moreover tight transverse confinement decouples the motion of trapped atoms in the longitudinal and transverse directions .",
    "thus when analyzing density ripples we can reduce the problem to the same number of dimensions as the initial trap ( see discussion below in sec .",
    "[ freeexp ] ) . for a 1d trap",
    "we consider a one - dimensional spectrum of density ripples , and for atoms which were originally confined in a pancake trap we analyze two - dimensional density ripples .    before we consider a general formalism , it is useful to present the analysis for the simplest situation",
    ". let us assume that the initial state can be described using the mean - field bogoliubov approach  @xcite .",

    "it is applicable for weakly interacting 3d bose condensates if the interactions during expansion are switched off using feshbach resonances  @xcite . in lower dimensions ,",

    "we show how the analysis of the density ripples can be extended to more complicated but experimentally relevant situations when the mean - field approach breaks down .",
    "we will find a similar structure to eq .",
    "( [ mean_field_final ] ) : positions of maxima and minima of the spectrum are given by the same approximate universal conditions on the momenta .",
    "however explicit expressions for the strength of individual maxima will be very different .",
    "they will contain rich information about fluctuations of low - dimensional condensates .      conceptually , the question we consider in this paper is somewhat similar to the interpretation of cosmological observations . in the latter case ,",
    "quantum fluctuations present in the early universe after its expansion result in observable anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background radiation  @xcite , and in the density ripples of matter which eventually evolve into galaxies  @xcite . in our case ,",
    "density ripples of the expanding clouds contain important information about correlations present in the trapped state .",
    "analogies between properties of condensates and cosmology have attracted significant attention recently  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the mentioned approaches , several other techniques have been used to experimentally study correlations of low - dimensional gases .",
    "some of them rely on creation of two copies of the same cloud  @xcite , while others require analysis of noise correlations  @xcite or in situ density - fluctuation statistics  @xcite .",

    "this is particularly important for weakly interacting 1d bose quasicondensates  @xcite , for which the standard approach to measuring temperature by fitting density profiles can not be extended to temperatures of the order of the chemical potential . in this regime ,",
