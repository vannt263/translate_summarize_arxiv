    "tailoring magnetic anisotropy at the atomic scale in a magnetic nanostructures is one of the most important challenges in spintronics  @xcite .",
    "systems with alternating ferromagnetic and noble metal layers have been studied intensely , as these structures may exhibit strong perpendicular anisotropy  @xcite .",
    "this is usually achieved by electronic hybridization between the valence levels of 3d transition metals ( fe , co ) with large magnetic moments , but relatively small spin - orbit coupling , and the valence level of 4d , 5d noble metals ( pd or pt ) with small magnetic moments , but large spin - orbit coupling .",
    "a layered sample structure of this composition can induce a preferential spin orientation perpendicular to the layers  @xcite .",
    "co / pd and co / pt multilayers have received considerable attention as promising candidates for perpendicular magnetic storage and patterned media  @xcite .",
    "while a precise control of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy has been achieved at the atomic thickness level , a corresponding tuning of the in - plane magnetic anisotropy has not been developed yet  @xcite .",
    "the effect of quantum well states ( qws ) on magnetic phenomena in layered magnetic structures has been studied before  @xcite .",
    "qws may arise when at lest one of the spatial dimensions of the sample has a distinct ratio with the electron wavelength , which is given by the inverse of the electron wave number @xmath3 .",
    "qws are often discussed in the language of electron confinement .",
    "this alludes to the physically appealing picture of electrons being trapped , _ confined _ , between potential barriers .",
    "this situation may give rise to a standing wave pattern of the electron density with pronounced spatial oscillations in the direction of confinement  @xcite .",
    "electron confinement within a nonmagnetic overlayer ( nm ) on a magnetic substrate is a spin - dependent phenomenon due to the action of the exchange interaction of the substrate .",
    "electron confinement leads to discrete energy levels in the electronic density of states , and these levels shift in energy with a variation of the relevant spatial dimension , _",
    "e.g. _ layer thickness .",
    "the resulting shifting in energy of qws also leads to a modulation of the electronic density of states near the fermi level ( e@xmath4 ) .",
    "this induces an oscillatory variation of physical properties such as inter - layer - exchange coupling , magnetic anisotropy and superconductivity as a function of film thickness  @xcite .",
    "while numerous studies report spin - dependent electron confinement of nearly free _ sp _ electrons  @xcite , qws from d electrons are still poorly explored  @xcite .",
    "the short lifetime and small mean - free path of d - states render them elusive to experimental detection  @xcite .",
    "however the confinement of d - electrons is particularly interesting in transition metal films , where the d - electrons largely govern the magnetic properties  @xcite .",
    "there is evidence for d - like qws from spin - resolved photoemission spectroscopy  @xcite in pd(111 ) films with a thickness of up to 3 atomic layers on ferromagnetic co. since these photoemission experiments average laterally over the photon interaction area , they require highly homogeneous films with a constant thickness over the sample area of @xmath5 0.1 mm . a complementary approach , including spatial resolution on the atomic scale , is provided by scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) , where both occupied and unoccupied states can be probed  @xcite .",
    "two concepts have been proposed to manipulate the magnetic anisotropy ( ma ) of a ferromagnet ( fm ) by qws .",
    "one concept exploits qws formed in the fm itself  @xcite , while the other exploits qws formed in the metallic layer adjacent to the fm film  @xcite .",
    "this metallic layer is often loosely classified as non - magnetic ( nm ) , indicating that the metallic film itself has a vanishing magnetic moment . while numerous theoretical and experimental studies  @xcite confirmed the effect of qws in ferromagnetic films on the magnetic anisotropy ,",
    "the role of qws in the metallic layer on the fm is still poorly explored .",
    "an oscillatory variation of the ma of fe and co films upon a variation of the cu metallic film thickness has been reported  @xcite .",
    "this effect has been attributed to _",
    "sp_-qws formed in the cu overlayer .",
    "the impact on the magnetic anisotropy results from spin - orbit ( so ) coupling  @xcite , which is affected by the qws - driven change of the electronic density of states of the adjacent nm .",
    "the electronic band structure of the magnetic layer responds by hybridization at the interface or by confinement of electronic states within the potential barriers at the surface or interface .",
    "hence one can anticipate that the evolution of qws in the nm with increasing layer thickness of a nm material with large spin - orbit coupling leads to stronger changes in the magnetic anisotropy of the adjacent ferromagnetic film , as compared to a nm material with small spin - orbit coupling ( cu ) .",
    "theoretically , a periodic variation of the magnetic anisotropy energy ( mae ) in pd / co bi - layers has been predicted  @xcite .",
    "these calculations suggest that the mae of ferromagnetic co is also influenced by spin - polarized qws formed in the adjacent pd layers .",
    "the pd / co system is a promising candidates to elucidate the electronic origin of mae oscillations due to large so coupling of pd .",
    "a word of caution on the term non - magnetic is appropriate in this respect .",
    "pd is at the verge of being a fm .",
    "theory predicts  @xcite a small induced magnetic moment in pd in close proximity to a fm .",
    "this induced fm in pd affects only the first pd layers near the interface , and we still regard the majority of the pd film , which is studied for a thickness of up to 21 ml here , as non - magnetic .",
    "clear mae oscillations , driven by qws in pd , have been predicted for the pd / co system in theory  @xcite .",
    "this prediction of large mae oscillations in the pd - co system has been made nearly 15 years ago , but it still awaits its experimental scrutinization .",
    "the following study provides experimental evidence in support of this model .    in this article",
    ", we experimentally demonstrate the direct correlation between oscillations of the in - plane magnetic anisotropy of co films and quantum well states formed in pd in the pd / co / cu(001 ) system . scanning tunneling spectroscopy identifies d - band qws in pd .",
    "our moke study on pd / co / cu(1,1,13 ) reveals pronounced pd thickness dependent variations of the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of co , which we ascribe to periodic changes in the density of states at the fermi level induced by qws in pd .",
    "our study reveals the effect of electron confinement in pd on the magnetic anisotropy of the adjacent ferromagnetic co film in the pd / co / cu(001 ) system .",
    "this is experimentally challenging , as the expected change of magnetic anisotropy due to pd qws is small  @xcite . to observe this effect two prerequisites need to be fulfilled : ( a ) in order to form distinct qws , the pd films should ideally be grown in a layer - by - layer manner , resulting in the most homogenous film thickness over the moke probing area ( @xmath6  mm@xmath7 ) ; ( b ) the interface between the fm co film and pd needs to be atomically sharp . in particular ,",
    "interface roughness needs to be low to ensure pronounced qws  @xcite .",
    "the pd / co / cu(001 ) system ( see inset of figure 1a ) fulfills both requirements .",
    "this is also due to its low lattice misfit , enabling epitaxial growth  @xcite of face - centered cubic ( fcc ) co(001 ) on cu(001 ) .",
    "the fcc phase of co has a lattice parameter at room temperature of 3.54 @xmath8  @xcite .",

    "pd was deposited at 300 k with a wedge - like spatial thickness variation ( see inset of fig .",
    "thus , the pd thickness increases along the [ -110 ] direction of the cu substrate by 3 ml per mm .",
    "the chemical cleanliness , the surface structure , and the surface morphology were investigated _ in - situ _ by auger electron spectroscopy ( aes ) , low energy electron diffraction ( leed ) , reflection high energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) and scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) .",
    "all stm / sts measurements were done at 4.7 k. stm tips were prepared from polycrystalline tungsten ( w ) wire , chemically etched and flashed to 2200 k. sts data were obtained using a lock - in technique to record the differential tunneling conductance ( di / dv ) by adding an ac ( frequency = 3.6 khz ) modulation voltage v@xmath12= 10 mv to the bias voltage , while ramping the applied bias v.    magnetic properties were probed by _ in - situ _ longitudinal moke .",

    "this has been observed before for co / cu(1,1,13 )  @xcite , and the larger moke signal for measurements perpendicular to the step edge is ascribed to an effective polar moke signal component .",
    "it can be ascribed to the macroscopically inclined surface of the stepped sample in the direction perpendicular to the step edge .",

    "this relation has been shown to be a reliable approximation , particularly for small variations of k@xmath44  @xcite .    a detailed description of the magnetization reversal  @xcite , however , is more complex .",
    "it demands taking into account the domain wall energy and avoiding the separation of the in - plane fourfold and in - plane twofold anisotropies  @xcite .",
    "still , the value of h@xmath27 is a measure of the in - plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy induced by the steps  @xcite .",

    "intriguingly , the shift field h@xmath27 changes pronouncedly with pd film thickness .",
    "this result reflects a pd - driven variation of the step - induced anisotropy of co. the h@xmath27 value decreases up to 6 ml pd coverage , and it stays constant above 18 ml pd . for a pd coverage above 6 ml , the characteristic easy axis of the 10 ml co films switches from along the steps to perpendicular to steps , and",
    "this is reflected in the h@xmath27 plot as zero transition with a corresponding change of sign .",
    "the split hysteresis loop of the perpendicular direction is replaced by the rectangular loop of an easy magnetization axis , where the parallel(@xmath45)-direction looses its easy character , see fig .",
    "how can the pd coverage modify the magnetic anisotropy of the co film ? at first sight one might speculate that the electronic structure and the structurally relaxation at step edges gets modified upon pd coverage  @xcite .",
    "it is plausible to assume that a strong change of the magnetic anisotropy at the step site results , changing the uniaxial anisotropy .",
    "however , the observed periodic change of the magnetic anisotropy remains mysterious in this picture .",
    "the complex hysteresis loops observed ( see fig.5c ) for higher pd coverage ( h @xmath45 to the step ) can be explained as the superposition of the split loops with the reverse hysteresis loops ( at low field )  @xcite .",
    "comparable effects of a change of anisotropy have been previously observed for different adsorbates such as cu , ag and o  @xcite .",
    "they were strong enough to change the easy magnetization axis by 90@xmath10 in - plane .",
    "this scenario would correspond to an interfacial effect .",
    "an interfacial effect would also result from periodic electronic changes near the pd / co interface , which modulate the anisotropy of the co through spin - orbit coupling and exchange interaction between co and pd . but",
    "according to the calculation by cinal  @xcite , we are not dealing with an interface effect . instead",
    ", the magnetic anisotropy oscillations originate almost entirely within the pd overlayer , and they are transferred through the co - pd interface into the co system . therefore , an important question is whether the period of magnetic anisotropy oscillations depends on the thickness of the co film or not . to tackle this experimentally we repeated the measurement for two samples with different co film thickness ( 10 and 14 ml ) , where two different strengths of uniaxial anisotropy are expected .",
    "qws related effects are usually strongest and best observed at low temperature  @xcite .",
    "consequently , we investigate the dependence of the switching field h@xmath27 on the pd thickness(n ) for pd(n)/10ml",
    "co / cu(1,1,13 ) at low temperature .",
    "figure 6 shows the stunning result .",
    "the switching field h@xmath27 shows periodic maxima ( n=3 , 19 , 15 ml ) and minima(n=6 , 12 , 18 ml ) as a function of pd thickness .",
    "the period of this oscillation is @xmath56 ml . the same periodicity is observed for measurements at 50 and 5 k. the perodicity also remains constant for a different co thickness of 14 ml , as revealed by the top and bottom panel of fig .",
    "6 , respectively .",
    "the shift field itself depends on the co thickness .",
    "this reflects that h@xmath27 itself is modified by qws formed in co. but the periodicity of the in - plane magnetic anisotropy variation remains constant at 6 ml pd .",
    "interestingly , the amplitude of the magnetic anisotropy oscillation are very similar for both co film thicknesses .",
    "all these results point at the importance of the pd layer and its thickness for the observed variation of the in - plane anisotropy , and this diminishes the importance of interface effects .",
    "the oscillation amplitude(@xmath5150 oe ) is almost three times larger than the anisotropy oscillation caused by qws in cu in the cu / co / cu(001 ) system  @xcite .",
    "this large amplitude of magnetic anisotropy oscillation is comparable to the previously observed effect of qws on the magnetic anisotropy of co films grown on vicinal cu(001 )  @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , qws formed in the pd overlayer offer a natural driving force for modifying the ma of the pd / co / cu system .",
    "qws modulate the density of states near the fermi level .",
    "the magnetic anisotropy is largely determined by states in proximity to the fermi energy  @xcite , and hence a modification of the magnetic anisotropy is expected .",
    "a more thorough analysis of the origin of the change of ma is given below .    both , the changes of magnetic anisotropy with increasing thickness of pd and the sts studies on qws in pd identify the same characteristic periodicity of 6 ml pd .",
    "this clearly suggests that the qws in pd are a key aspect for the oscillatory magnetic anisotropy of co. from the sts analysis we showed that the pd qws have predominantly d character ( @xmath0@xmath1 a - like ) . in principle",
    ", theses qws should therefore affect the anisotropy significantly , as the magnetic anisotropy of transition metals such as co is mainly governed by d - bands .",
    "cinal has studied the impact of a pd coverage on the magnetic anisotropy of co  @xcite .",
    "the author suggests that the magnetic anisotropy oscillations in the pd / co system are induced by pairs of spin - polarized qws in pd , where each pair is degenerate at the @xmath2 point of the two - dimensional surface brillouin zone .",
    "the majority spin qws , forming the pairs , were derived from bulk pd electronic states , whose three - dimensional wave - vector were quantized in the direction perpendicular to the surface  @xcite .",
    "an experimental support for this comes from our sts studies which identify corresponding qwss .",
    "minority spin qws in pd hybridize with co d states and form a resonance . as a result",
    "a periodic change of the electronic structure of the ferromagnetic co leads to the oscillation of the magnetic anisotropy , which is mediated by the large spin - orbit coupling of pd . note that the magnetic anisotropy is a quadratic form of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the large amplitude of ma oscillations in pd / co as compared to the cu / co system is a cnsequence of the larger spin - orbit interaction in pd as compared to cu .",
    "theory also predicts that the anisotropy oscillation period is governed by the extremal dimension of the bulk pd fermi surface .",
    "our experimental results corroborate this prediction .",
    "the observed damping of ma oscillations at room temperature speaks in favor of an effect driven by electronic states near the fermi level .",
    "thus , our experiments support fully the theoretical prediction of the dominant role of qws in pd for the magnetic anisotropy of co in the pd / co / cu system .",
    "our combined stm and moke studies reveal the effect of electron confinement and qws in pd on the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of ferromagnetic co in pd / co / cu .",
    "pseudomorphic growth , well - defined interfaces , and sts with single layer thickness resolution allow us to probe occupied and unoccupied qws and extract an accurate dispersion of the pd electronic d - band .",
    "the magnetic anisotropy is found to oscillate as a function of pd thickness with a period of 6 atomic layers at low temperature .",
    "we ascribe the modulation of the magnetic anisotropy in co to thickness dependent crossing of states of the fermi energy due to qws in pd .",
    "we observe larger amplitude oscillations of the ma in pd / co as compared to the cu / co system .",
    "these results are additional ingredients for the understanding of electron confinement effects in spin - polarized systems and for tuning magnetic anisotropy in magnetic multilayers at the nanoscale .",
    "further experiments on systems with even larger spin - orbit coupling of the non - ferromagnetic component , such as pt , would be interesting , as possibly even larger anisotropy oscillations could be induced .",
    "the authors deeply acknowledge marek cinal ( pan , warsaw , poland ) and eric montoya ( uc , riverside ) for fruitful discussion . we thank w. greie , f. weiss and h. menge for their technical support .",
