    "although the standard @xmath3 electroweak gauge theory successfully explains all current electroweak data , the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking has been tested only partially . since in the standard model spontaneous symmetry breaking",
    "is due to the higgs mechanism , the search for a higgs particle will be one of the main tasks of future colliders . + at present , lep gives a lower limit of 114.4 gev / c@xmath4 @xcite for the higgs boson mass .",
    "there is also an indirect upper limit from electroweak precision measurements of 219 gev / c@xmath4 at a 95% confidence level @xcite which is valid in the minimal standard model .",
    "however , this limit is still preliminary and the quality of the sm fit , when including all ew measurements from both low and high energy experiments , is still an object of discussion amongst experts @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a heavier higgs boson would be consistent with the electroweak precision measurements in models more general than the minimal standard model @xcite . in this first analysis",
    "we will therefore also consider higher higgs masses well above this limit , as can be produced at high energy hadron colliders such as the lhc ( pp collisions at 14 tev ) .",
    "a standard model higgs boson lying below the @xmath5 threshold will mainly decay into a @xmath6 pair . in this case",
    ", there is an overwhelming direct qcd background which dominates the signal .",
    "therefore , the higgs boson is difficult to study in detail in this mass region , even though one can use rare decays as a signal .",
    "rare decays considered in the literature include , for example , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "all of these signals are rather difficult to see , but can eventually be used to establish the existence of the higgs boson @xcite . while these decay modes can be used to discover the higgs boson , a detailed study of its properties will be difficult .",
    "+ the situation is much better for a heavy higgs boson ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "for such a higgs boson the main decay products are vector boson pairs , @xmath13 or @xmath14 . for the latter decay mode , a clear signal for the higgs",
    "consists of a peak in the invariant mass spectrum of the produced vector bosons .",
    "the double leptonic decay of the @xmath15 boson , @xmath16 , leads to a particularly clean signal .",
    "+ in this case , the basic strategy for discovering a higgs boson in a clean mode is to select events with 4 high p@xmath17 leptons that can be combined to form two z - bosons . here , an exposure of 30 fb@xmath2 is already sufficient .",
    "if one finds such a signal one might be tempted to assume this to be the standard model higgs boson . however , given the fact that the higgs sector is not fully prescribed , one has to allow for other possibilities . in strongly interacting models , for instance , low lying ( pseudo-)vector resonances are possible@xcite",
    ". also , pseudoscalar particles are present in a variety of models @xcite . therefore , the first priority after finding a signal is to establish the nature of the resonance , in particular its spin and cp - eigenvalue .",
    "this can be done by studying angular distributions and correlations among the decay leptons . in the following",
    ", we will make this study .",
    "we will limit ourselves to ( pseudo-)vector and ( pseudo-)scalar particles . to demonstrate consistency with a spin 0 , cp even hypothesis , we will compare the angular distributions , to those produced by different particles , always assuming the production rate of a standard model higgs boson .",
    "this is the right assumption to make because , in order to be recognized as a candidate for a standard model like higgs , the detected signal must be a resonance with the appropriate width and branching ratios . since the production mechanism - gluon - fusion rules out spin 1 particles , due to yang s theorem@xcite - can not be seen , the only way to prove that the spin and cp nature of the new particle is standard model like is to study the decay angles of the leptons .",
    "+ theoretical studies of angular distributions have been performed in the literature [ 9 - 15 ] .",
    "so far , such studies have been limited to theoretical discussions .",
    "however , it was shown in @xcite that acceptance and efficiencies of the detector can play a role since they can generate correlations , mimicking physical ones .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to use a detector simulation in order to establish how well one can do in practice .",
    "+ the complete triple differential cross - sections for a higgs - boson decaying into two onshell z - bosons which subsequently decay into fermion pairs can be calculated at tree level .",
    "the angular dependence of this cross section is given in the appendix together with the most important integrated angular distributions .",
    "for the definition of the angles see figure 1 .",
    "+    we study essentially two distributions .",
    "one is the distribution of the cosine of the polar angle , @xmath18 , of the decay leptons relative to the @xmath15 boson .",
    "because the heavy higgs decays mainly into longitudinally polarised vector bosons the cross section @xmath19 should show a maximum around @xmath20)=0 .",
    "the other is the distribution of the angle @xmath21 between the decay planes of the two @xmath15 bosons in the rest frame of the higgs boson .",
    "this distribution depends on the details of the higgs decay mechanism . within the standard model ,",
    "a behaviour roughly like @xmath22 is expected .",
    "this last distribution is flattened in the decay chain @xmath23 , because of the small vector coupling of the leptons , in contrast to the decay of the higgs boson into w s or decay of the z into quarks .",
    "also , cuts can significantly affect the correlations .",
    "therefore one needs a precise measurement of the momenta of the outgoing leptons",
    ". the atlas - detector should be well - suited to measure these distributions , since the muon and electron reconstruction is very precise over a large solid angle .",
    "a detector monte - carlo is however needed in order to determine whether the angular distributions can be measured sufficiently well in order to determine the quantum numbers of the higgs particle .",
    "+ the present paper is organized as follows . in chapter 2 the generator",
    "is described , in chapter 3 detector simulation and reconstruction are given . in chapter 4",
    "we define quantities that can be used to characterize the different distributions .",
    "in chapter 5 we present the results , concluding that the quantum numbers of the higgs particle can indeed be determined . in the appendix",
    "we give formulae for the complete differential and integrated distributions for the decay of the resonance assuming arbitrary couplings computed in tree level and narrow width approximation .",
    "in order to distinguish between different and/or cp - eigenvalues @xmath24 one needs to study four different distributions : that resulting from the decay of the standard model higgs boson , and the three distributions that would result from hypothetical particles with spin and cp - eigenvalue combinations ( 0 , 1 ) , ( 1 , 1 ) , ( 1 , -1 ) .",
    "the feasibility of using angular correlations in the decay of the z bosons in order to distinguish between these particles has been evaluated using two different monte - carlo generators .",
    "one was written for the standard model higgs ( @xmath25 ) and the irreducible zz - background.@xcite the latter includes contributions from both gluons and quarks to the zz production ( and ) , whereas all higgs production mechanisms other than the gluon fusion are neglected .",
    "this generator keeps all polarisations of the z - boson for the quark initiated as well as for the gluon initiated processes .",
    "this allows for an analysis of the angular distributions of the leptons .",
    "the gluonic production of z - boson pairs is only about 30% of the total background .",
    "however , one should not ignore its contribution , since it has different angular distributions from the other backgrounds and its presence can affect measured correlations .",
    "the programme contains no k - factors , therefore our conclusions regarding the feasibility of the determination of higgs quantum numbers are conservative .",
    "indeed , k - factors are expected to be larger for gluon - induced processes ( such as the signal ) than for quark - induced processes ( 70% of the background ) . since the narrow width approximation is used , the results are only valid for higgs masses above the zz threshold . + for the alternative particles , a new generator was written based on an article by c. a. nelson and j. r. dell aquilla @xcite .",
    "the programmes for the production of background , the standard model higgs and all alternative particles use cteq4 m structure functions @xcite and hdecay @xcite for branching - ratio and width of the higgs , and all use the narrow width approximation .",
    "the background as well as all cross sections for the four simulations are taken from the first generator .",
    "thus , all cases show identical distributions of invariant mass of the z - pairs and transverse momentum @xmath26 of z - bosons and leptons and have the same width and cross sections .",
    "the only difference lies in the angular distributions of the leptons . for the alternative particles",
    "no special assumption concerning the coupling has to be made ; only cp - invariance is assumed .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the angular correlations are completely independent of the production mechanism .",
    "the detector response is simulated using atlfast @xcite , a software - package for particle level simulation of the atlas detector .",
    "it is used for fast event - simulation including the most crucial detector aspects .",
    "starting from a list of particles in the event , it provides a list of reconstructed jets , isolated leptons and photons and expected missing transverse energy .",
    "it applies momentum- and energy- smearing to all reconstructed particles .",
    "the values of the detector - dependent parameters are chosen to match the expected performance that was evaluated mostly by full simulations using geant3@xcite .",
    "+ the event selection is modeled exactly after the event selection in the atlas - physics - tdr @xcite .",
    "four leptons ( electrons or muons ) are required in the pseudorapidity range ( @xmath27 being the angle to the beam axis ) .",
    "two of the leptons are required to have transverse momenta greater than 20 gev / c and the two other leptons must have transverse momenta greater than 7 gev / c each . a lepton identification efficiency of 90% per lepton was assumed .",
    "two z bosons are reconstructed by choosing lepton - pairs of matching flavour and opposite sign .",
    "if the flavours of all four leptons are equal , the combination is chosen , which minimizes the sum of the squared deviation of the invariant mass of the pairs with opposite sign from the z mass ( i.e. choose combination ab / cd that minimizes ( m@xmath28-m@xmath29)@xmath4 + ( m@xmath30-m@xmath29)@xmath4 ) .",
    "the reconstructed invariant mass of the two reconstructed z bosons has to lie within two times the width of the reconstructed mass peak of the higgs resonance around the centre of the peak . for high higgs masses ( @xmath31 300gev / c@xmath4 )",
    "this is only little more than two times the decay width , while for smaller masses the experimental resolution dominates .",
    "+ throughout this paper , we use the term signal for distributions where the background has been statistically subtracted .",
    "the only background considered is the z pair production .",
    "other possible backgrounds like top pair production or zbb are negligible for masses of the higgs boson above 200 gev / c@xmath4 .",
    "systematic uncertainties due to the simulation of the background could be studied by comparing distributions from the sidebins of the higgs signal with the results of the generator .",
    "a proper treatment of the background is very important , since the angular distributions of the background itself and correlations introduced by detector effects have a large impact on the shape of the distributions discussed .",
    "these effects are detailed below .",
    "+    for high invariant masses , the z bosons from the background processes are mainly transversely polarised leading to a polar angle distribution of the form @xmath32 .",
    "this distribution flattens the @xmath33 distribution expected for the higgs decay .",
    "figure [ figpolar1 ] shows the polar angle distributions of the signal ( left ) and the background ( right ) .",
    "the dashed line shows the shape of the distribution expected when no cuts are applied and the detector response is not taken into account .",
    "it has just been scaled by the overall acceptance of the cuts , so that the shape can be compared .",
    "the expected distribution with all cuts and smearing applied is drawn as a solid line .",
    "figures [ figpolar1 ] and [ figplane1 ] are produced assuming a higgs mass of 200gev / c@xmath4 and z decaying to muons only .",
    "for the decay zz @xmath0 e@xmath34e@xmath35e@xmath34e@xmath35 or zz",
    "@xmath0 @xmath36e@xmath34e@xmath35 the graphs look similar .",
    "the smearing effects are largely independent of the higgs mass .",
    "+    the effect of the detector acceptance and isolation cuts on the decay plane angle distribution is shown in figure [ figplane1 ] .",
    "again , the distribution of the signal is shown left and the background right .",
    "the dashed histogrammes are scaled to have the same integral as the solid histogrammes , and zero is suppresssed in order to facilitate the comparison of the shape .",
    "the definition of the line styles are the same as above . for the decay plane angle ,",
    "the background shows an almost flat distribution before applying selection cuts . but a minor correlation is introduced by detector effects .",
    "this has been simulated and taken into account for the analysis of decay plane angle distributions . in conclusion ,",
    "the isolation cuts lead to a small distortion of the angular distributions as discussed in @xcite , but these effects are almost negligible for the atlas detector .",
    "the cut on @xmath37 enhances the decay plane correlation a little , but the smearing and the @xmath26 requirements reduce this effect .",
    "altogether , there is a small enhancement of the correlation of almost the same amount for all four particles .",
    "+ a further cut on the transverse momentum of the z bosons @xmath38 is known to additionally reduce the background , but it also affects the correlation . since an optimisation of the signal - to - background ratio is not crucial to this analysis , this cut has not been applied , rendering the analysis less dependent on the details of the production mechanism like initial @xmath39 of the higgs boson . +",
    "the differential cross sections for the different models can be computed directly or can be derived from the formulae given in @xcite .",
    "the explicit distributions are given in the appendix . from the article",

    "this error is not considered in the rest of the analysis .",
    "furthermore , the effects will be even smaller when considering k - factors .",
    "any k greater than 1 will give better conditions to check the background distributions . and",
    ", since the k - factor of the gluonic higgs production is higher than the k - factor of the main zz production process by quark antiquark pairs , the signal to background ratio will be even higher than predicted here .",
    "in chapter 4 , the exact results for the signal were given .",
    "however , in practice one needs a procedure to separate signal from background , which will lead to uncertainties in the distributions .",
    "the expected errors have been calculated by generating a large number of events and scaling the distributions to the expected number of events , since the expected values of the parameters follow a gaussian distribution .",
    "the background was statistically subtracted after applying the same cuts to it as were applied to the signal .",
    "the error reflects the statistical error from the number of the signal events , the statistical error from the number of background events subtracted and the error made by the estimation of the number of background events as described in chapter 5 .",
    "no error from a possibly different angular distribution of background events has been taken into acount , but we have shown that the effect is small .",

    "nevertheless , @xmath64 can be useful to rule out a cp odd spin 0 particle .",
    "+ the values of @xmath63 get more widely separated when the correlation between the sign of @xmath67 for the two z bosons and @xmath21 is exploited . in figure",
