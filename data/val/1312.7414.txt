    "bag - of - words ( bow ) was originally proposed for document retrieval . in recent years , the method has been successfully applied to image retrieval tasks in computer vision community @xcite .",
    "the method is attractive because of its efficient image representation and retrieval .",
    "bow represents an image as a sparse vector of visual words , and thus images can be searched efficiently using an inverted index file system .",
    "other major application areas of the bow method are appearance - based mobile robot localization and slam problems .",
    "the fundamental issue involved with the appearance - based approach to both visual slam and global localization is the place recognition .",
    "robot should be able to recognize the places it has visited before to localise itself or refine the map of the environment .",
    "this task is performed by matching the current view of the robot to the existing map that contains the images of the previously visited locations . in this paper",
    "we consider the problem of appearance - based localization in which the map is known _ a priori_.    in large - scale environments maps contain too many images to match .",
    "the image search in such a large map is still a challenging and open problem .",
    "matching images by comparing the local features of each image directly to the local features of all other images in the map is not practical .",
    "bag - of - words proposes a more efficient approach ; first , rather than matching with a pool of million visual features extracted from many thousands of images , the local features are mapped to a smaller number of vocabulary words that are built in an offline phase . this process is called vector - quantization .",
    "once the visual words are identified in the query image , they are used as indices into the image database , to directly retrieve the images that share the same words .",
    "when the vocabulary is large , the vector - quantization process can be a computationally expensive task in real - time localization .",
    "considerable research has been done to speed up the search ; some papers @xcite do approximate nearest - neighbor search using structures like vocabulary trees @xcite ; some methods reduce the number of local image features by selecting only a fraction of features that are highly discriminative @xcite ; another group makes use of more compact feature descriptors like @xcite . in this paper , we first show that some image retrieval tasks are _ easier _ for bow method .",
    "the hardness criteria , defined later , concerns how distinctive the image query is among all images in the dataset . given this criteria ,",
    "we show that the bow search can be terminated earlier for easier queries .",
    "this means , in such queries , mapping only a portion of features can be sufficient to yield a relatively good result .",
    "the stopping rule saves considerable amount of computational resources .",
    "the intuition behind this is that when there are many similar images to the query image , in terms of the number of common words they share , the search becomes more difficult as more processing is required to find the closest match candidate .",
    "whereas when the query image has only a few match candidates , i.e. , it shares its visual words with only a few images , the search becomes easy as vector - quantizing only a small number of features is sufficient to find the closest match to the query . by exploiting this fact",
    ", we can stop the vector - quantization when the search is easy and the nearest neighbor to the query is easy to find .",
    "our method acts as an approximate image search algorithm .",
    "our experimental results show that the accuracy decreases only slightly while the computational cost decreases dramatically",
    ".    our approach can be best compared with the approach of cummins and newman @xcite who use concentration inequalities ( bennett s inequality in their case ) for early bail - out in multi - hypothesis testing that excludes unlikely location hypotheses from further evaluation .",
    "however , we use a different bail - out strategy for the process of vector - quantization . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the image representation and the inverted - index search algorithm used in bow framework .",
    "this is followed by a review of the localization algorithms that employ bow for the image search .",
    "our proposed method to improve the efficiency of bow is described in section  [ sec : method ] .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] presents the experimental results and the evaluation criteria , and the result of our comparisons .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper in section  [ sec : conclud ] .",
    "bag - of - words is a popular model that has been used in image classification , objection recognition , and appearance - based navigation . because of its simplicity and search efficiency",
    "it has been used as a successful method in web search engines for large - scale image and document retrieval @xcite .",
    "bag - of - words model represents an image by a sparse vector of visual words .",
    "image features , e.g. , sifts @xcite , are sampled and clustered ( e.g. , using k - means ) in order to quantize the space into a discrete set of visual words .",
    "the centroids of clusters are then considered as visual words which form the visual vocabulary .",
    "once a new image arrives , its local features are extracted and vector - quantized into the visual words .",
    "each word might be weighed by some score which is either the word frequency in the image ( i.e. , _ tf _ ) or the `` term frequency - inverse document frequency '' or _",
    "tf - idf _ @xcite .",
    "a histogram of weighted visual words , which is typically sparse , is then built and used to represent the image .",
    "an inverted index file , used in the bow framework , is an efficient image search tool in which the visual words are mapped to the database images .",
    "each visual word serves as a table index and points to the indices of the database images in which the word occurs .",
    "since not every image contains every word and also each word does not occur in every image , the retrieval through inverted - index file is fast .",
    "bag - of - words model has been extensively used as the basis of the image search in appearance - based localization or slam algorithms @xcite .",
    "cummins and newman @xcite propose a probabilistic framework over the bag - of - words representation of locations , for the appearance - based place recognition . along with the visual vocabulary they also learn the chow liu tree to capture the co - occurrences of visual words .",
    "similarly , angeli _ et al . _",
    "@xcite develop a probabilistic approach for place recognition in slam .",
    "they build two visual vocabularies incrementally and use two bow representations as an input of a bayesian filtering framework to estimate the likelihood of loop closures .    assuming each image has hundreds of sift features , mapping the features to the visual words , using a linear search method , is computationally expensive and not practical for real - time localization .",
    "researchers have tackled this problem with different approaches that speeds up the search but at the expense of accuracy .",
    "a number of papers have employed compact feature descriptors that speeds up the search .",
    "glvez - lpez and tards in @xcite propose to use fast @xcite and breif @xcite binary features and introduce a bow model that descritizes a binary space .",
    "similarly , @xcite use surf @xcite to have a more compact feature descriptor .",
    "another approach is to use approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms , like hierarchical k - means @xcite , kd - trees @xcite or graph - based search methods @xcite and @xcite , to speed up the quantization process .",
    "achar _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and zhang @xcite propose reducing the number of features in each image , thereby reducing ( removing ) the vector - quantization process .",
    "they keep track of the features that are repeatable over time . however , these approaches are more specific to the navigation problems where the data is sequential and there exists considerable overlaps between consecutive images .",
    "our approach is more similar to this group as we also reduce the amount of feature mapping .",
    "however rather than only selecting a small set of features , we use all features but we stop the mapping process when necessary . our approach is also more general as it does not depend on the sequential property of the data .",
    "vector - quantization ( vq ) is an expensive process when the bow - based image retrieval is performed in large - scale environments , in which hundreds of features extracted from an image need to be matched against hundreds of thousands of visual words .",
    "the question is if we really need to vector - quantize all features ?",
    "depending on the difficulty level of the search , the number of features to be converted to visual words may vary .",
    "we call a search difficult when there are many similar images to the query and thus finding the nearest neighbor among all those candidates requires more computations",
    ". whereas in an easy search , the query image is similar to only a few images in the database and it can find its true match after processing only a small percentage of features .",
    "figure  [ diff_search ] and figure  [ easy_search ] show examples of easy and difficult searches .",
    "the histograms show the similarity of each database image to the query based on the _ tf - idf _ score .",
    "the difficult search needs to process at least @xmath0 of features to find the closest match to the query ( indicated by the peak of the histogram ) , however the easy search can stop the search after processing only @xmath1 of features as the peak does not change until the end of the search . comparing the distance between the peak and average of the histograms , it can be seen that in difficult search this distance is smaller than that in easy search , which is expected .",
    "initially each image starts with no vote . in original bow",
    ", image features are converted to visual words one by one and the histogram ( of images scores ) is built incrementally .",
    "each bin of the histogram corresponds to one of the database images and indicates the score of that image .",
    "each visual word will cast a distance - weighted vote for multiple images , i.e. , histogram bins .",
    "this process continues until all words cast their votes and then the peak of the histogram ( the bin with the highest score ) determines the nearest neighbor to the query .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the experimental results shown in tables [ exp1:city1 ] to [ exp1:newcol2 ] have been performed by rule 1 .",
    "figures  [ fig : rules ] and [ fig : rules2 ] show the result of applying different rules to the bow search on the new college ( right - side sequence ) and city center ( right - side sequence ) datasets , respectively .",
    "the graphs have been generated by varying the stopping thresholds . as can be seen ,",
    "stopping rules # 1 and # 3 generate better results . by reducing the number of processed features to half the accuracy only decreases slightly .    figure  [ fig : feat_im ] shows another experiment that validates our proposed stopping method .",
    "figure shows the relation between the number of images and the percentage of features they need to process to obtain the same result as that of the original bow .",
    "the experiment has been done on city center dataset ( left - side sequence ) with the stopping rule # 1 used .",
    "we set the threshold to @xmath2 to get exactly the same accuracy of original bow .",
    "as can be seen , only @xmath3 images need to process @xmath4@xmath5 of their features , another @xmath6 only need to vector - quantize smaller percentages of features .",
    "we observed that the computational requirements of the bow method can be significantly reduced by allocating less computations to easier search queries .",
    "deciding when to terminate the search is treated as a stopping problem .",
    "we proposed several stopping rules and showed their effectiveness on an appearance - based localization problem .",
