    "very nice and effective procedures have been devised , like isomorphism pruning @xcite and orbital branching  @xcite .",
    "there has also been progress in understanding linear inequalities to be added to certain integer programs in order to remove symmetry . towards this end , orbitopes have been introduced in  @xcite .    the _ packing orbitope _ @xmath1 and the _ partitioning orbitope _",

    "complete descriptions with linear inequalities have been derived for these polytopes ( see thm .",
    "16 and  17 in  @xcite ) .",
    "knowledge on orbitopes turns out to be quite useful in practical symmetry reduction for certain integer programming models .",
    "for instance , in a well - known formulation of the graph partitioning problem ( for graphs having  @xmath4 nodes to be partitioned into  @xmath5 parts ) the symmetry on the 0/1-variables @xmath6 indicating whether node  @xmath7 is put into part  @xmath8 of the partitioning the symmetry arising from permuting the parts can be removed by requiring  @xmath9 .",
    "we refer to  @xcite and  @xcite for a more detailed discussion of the practical use of orbitopes .",
    "the topic of this paper are extended formulations for these orbitopes , i.e. , ( simple ) linear descriptions of higher dimensional polytopes which can be projected to  @xmath1 and  @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , such extended formulations play important roles in polyhedral combinatorics and integer programming in general , because rather than solving a linear optimization problem over a polyhedron in the original space , one may solve it over a ( hopefully simpler described ) polyhedron of which the first one is a linear projection .",
    "for instance , the lift - and - project approach  @xcite and other general reformulation schemes ( e.g. , the ones due to lovsz and schrijver  @xcite as well as adams and sherali  @xcite ) are based on extended formulations .",

    "more classical is the general theory on extended formulations obtained from ( certain ) dynamic programming algorithms  @xcite .",
    "the results of this paper are much in the spirit of the latter work .    in order to give an overview on the contributions of this paper",

    "[ sec : setup ] . in  @xcite it",
    "is also proved that , up to a few exceptions , these exponentially many scis define facets of the orbitopes . the proof given in  @xcite of the fact that the sci - system completely describes these orbitopes is rather lengthy and somewhat technical .",
    "extending over pages @xmath16 to @xmath17 , it hardly leaves ( not only ) the reader with a good idea of the reasons for the sci - system being sufficient to describe the orbitopes .",
    "in contrast to this , the contributions of the present work are the following : we provide a quite simple extended formulation for  @xmath1 ( along with a rather short proof establishing this ) and , moreover , we show by some simple and natural ( not technical ) arguments that the sci - system describes the projection of the feasible region of that extended formulation to the original space , thus providing a new proof showing that the sci - system describes  @xmath1 .",
    "this latter proof is much shorter than the original one , and it seems to provide much better insight into the reasons for the sci - system to describe the orbitopes .",
    "clearly , as @xmath2 is a face of  @xmath1 , the results for the latter polytope immediately yield corresponding results for the first one .",
    "however , besides leading to that simpler proof , we believe that our extended formulation for @xmath1 is interesting itself .",
    "it provides a description of a quite natural polytope ( the orbitope  @xmath1 ) by a system of constraints in a space whose dimension is roughly twice the original dimension  @xmath18 with only linearly ( in  @xmath18 ) many nonzero coefficients , while every linear description of the orbitope in the original space requires exponentially many inequalities .",
    "this may also turn out to be computationally attractive .",

    "due to remark  [ rem : cuts ] , we only need to prove @xmath238    we construct a directed @xmath60-@xmath56-path  @xmath35 in the residual network with respect to the flow  @xmath124 ( containing only those arcs of  @xmath24 that are not saturated by  @xmath124 ) with @xmath239 or @xmath63 in the following way : starting from the trivial ( length zero ) @xmath217-@xmath56-path with @xmath240 , in each step we extend the path at its current start node  @xmath217 by the diagonal arc entering  @xmath217 if this arc is part of the residual network , and by the vertical arc entering  @xmath217 otherwise .",
    "as the residual network contains all vertical arcs , we clearly can proceed this way until the start node of the current path is some node @xmath60 with @xmath239 or with @xmath63 .",
    "since  @xmath35 is a path in the residual network and due to  , we have @xmath241    if @xmath63 , part  ( 2 ) of lemma  [ lem : cuts ] together with   yields @xmath242 , from which   follows since  @xmath175 satisfies the row - sum inequality @xmath13 and the nonnegativity constraints .    if @xmath243 , then @xmath61 .",
    "thus , according to part  ( 1 ) of lemma  [ lem : cuts ] and due to  , we have @xmath244 since we preferred diagonal arcs from the residual network in our backwards construction of  @xmath35 , we find that all arcs from @xmath71 are saturated by the flow  @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , for the shifted column @xmath41 , we have ( using  ) @xmath245 let @xmath246 be the arc in  @xmath35 entering  @xmath56 , and denote by  @xmath247 the path arising from  @xmath35 by removing  @xmath248 .",
    "if  @xmath248 is diagonal , then the @xmath42-@xmath43-path  @xmath247 satisfies @xmath249 , and the shifted - column inequality @xmath46 ( satisfied by  @xmath175 ) establishes   via  .    if  @xmath248 is vertical , by construction of  @xmath35 , we have @xmath250 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath42-@xmath251-path  @xmath247 satisfies @xmath252 . thus using the shifted - column inequality @xmath253 one obtains from   the inequality @xmath254 thus , is established also in this case , which finally proves theorem  [ thm : liftscipoly ] .",
    "in our view , the extended formulations for the orbitopes  @xmath1 and @xmath2 presented in this paper once more demonstrate the power that lies in the concept of extended formulations . not only do the extended formulations provide a very compact way of describing the orbitopes , but",
    "also do they allow to derive rather simple proofs of the fact that nonnegativity constraints , row - sum inequalities / equations , and scis suffice in order to linearly describe  @xmath1 and  @xmath2 .    to us",
    "it seems that these proofs better reveal the reason why scis are necessary and ( basically ) sufficient in these descriptions . the construction of the flow in the proof of thm .",
    "[ thm : liftscipoly ] is quite natural .",
    "the rest of the proof ( i.e. , the backwards construction of the path  @xmath35 ) one may also have done without knowing the scis in advance .",
    "thus , knowing the extended formulation , one possibly could also have _ detected _ scis on the way trying to do this proof .",
    "an interesting practical question is whether the very sparse and compact extended formulations for orbitopes lead to performance gains in branch - and - cut algorithms compared to versions that dynamically add scis via the linear time separation algorithm ( described in  @xcite ) .",
