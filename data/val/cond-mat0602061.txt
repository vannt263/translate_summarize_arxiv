    "in the same way as a classical electromagnetic field obeying maxwell s equations arises as an assembly of photons all in the same quantum state , a bose - einstein condensate , composed of bosonic atoms all in the same quantum state , behaves very much like a classical field @xmath0 , whose equation of motion is the gross - pitaevskii equation@xmath1   \\psi \\left ( \\mathbf{x},t\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the gross - pitaevskii equation  has been extraordinarily successful in describing a wide range of the phenomena associated with bose - einstein condensates  nevertheless , there are phenomena in which the quantized nature of this field is important . for example , when two bose - einstein condensates collide at a sufficiently high velocity , a _",
    "halo _ of elastically scattered atoms is produced @xcite .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii equation  with initial conditions corresponding to two bose - einstein condensates does not predict this scattering  it is a direct effect of the fact that the quantized field consists of interacting particles , and at its most elementary level , this halo is simply the result of elastic scattering of the constituent particles in the bose - einstein condensate .",
    "a description of this phenomenon by means of the phenomenological inclusion of loss terms @xcite , in a way reminiscent of the boltzmann equation , was successful for collisions of smaller condensates , but seriously under - estimated the scattering for higher condensate densities .",
    "this underestimation arises because at high condensate densities , the final states into which the scattering occurs can become sufficiently highly occupied to cause _ bosonic stimulation _ , which a simple boltzmann treatment can not produce .",
    "on the other hand , a treatment in terms of linearized quantum field theory @xcite can deal with the bosonic stimulation effects of highly occupied final states , but , being linearized , can treat neither the effects of large depletion , nor the essentially classical nonlinearity effects so well handled by the gross - pitaevskii equation .    an alternative method is the _ truncated wigner method_. this is a treatment of quantum field theory in which quantum mechanics is simulated by a classical random process .",
    "the method is approximate , but nevertheless very useful , both for quantum optical systems , where the field under consideration is the electromagnetic field , and for bose - einstein condensates , where the matter - wave field is under consideration , and reproduces many quantum mechanical features , such as quantum correlation functions , of these systems .",
    "the application to bose - einstein condensates has been developed by several groups @xcite with considerable success .    in qualitative terms , the truncated wigner method provides a description of quantum field theory based on the gross - pitaevskii equationin which quantum mechanical vacuum fluctuations are simulated by by adding appropriate classical fluctuations in addition to the coherent field of the _ initial state _ of the bose - einstein condensate . these amount",
    "to half a quantum per degree of freedom , corresponding to the zero point energy of the harmonic oscillator which represents each mode of the field  the precise way in which this is done is presented in sect.[sssection : initial states ] .",
    "the elastic scattering effects which are not produced directly by a solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation  for a coherent initial condensate field now appear as four - wave mixing between the coherent condensate field and the simulated vacuum fluctuations .    since the number of modes in a _",
    "quantum field theory is infinite , the addition of a half a quantum per mode does in principle introduce a infinite density of vacuum fluctuations . nevertheless , this does not invalidate the method . in practice",
    "what is used for the description of a bose - einstein condensate  is an _ _ effective field theory__@xcite , valid only on a rather coarse spatial scale . because of this , one can use a quantum field theory which contains only modes up to a certain cutoff value of the momentum , with an appropriately renormalized interaction . in a practical implementation of a cutoff field theory",
    ", one uses the standard contact interaction , with strength proportional to the scattering length , with corrections which depend on the size of the momentum cutoff .",
    "the density of added vacuum fluctuations is then quite finite , but cutoff dependent .",
    "the cutoff dependent effects of the vacuum fluctuations are then compensated by the cutoff dependent interaction strength . in simulations",
    "we must introduce this cutoff explicitly  in practice , for the choices of parameters we make , the cutoff corrections are 0.5% see sects.[sssection : validity of the effective field theory ] , [ ssection : truncated wigner method validity criteria ] .    a related approach , the _ positive - p _",
    "method @xcite , ( and its generalization , the _ gauge positive - p _ method ) has also proven useful in describing bose - condensed systems .",
    "both the truncated wigner and positive - p methods are examples of the general class of `` classical field methods '' well known in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "the positive - p methods are in principle exact , but are still difficult to implement for the kind of system we are considering here .",
    "however , technical progress is currently being made @xcite , and there does seem to be real promise that these exact methods will become practical .",
    "we recently applied the truncated wigner method to the problem of colliding condensates @xcite , showing that it was feasible to simulate a realistic three - dimensional system and produce quantitative results .",
    "the aim of this paper is to expand upon and extend the treatment presented in there . to this end",
    "we provide here :    * a detailed derivation of the truncated wigner method for colliding condensates , including a heuristic demonstration of how we can justify the neglect of terms arising in a wigner function treatment of the problem , setting up the foundation of the method .",
    "we show in sects.[validity][critique ] that for this kind of problem , the validity criterion for the method is that the density of the condensate ( in co - ordinate space ) must be very large compared with the density of the added quantum fluctuations .",

    "the main feature to note is that the cutoff necessary in the effective field theory can not be simply provided by the fineness of the spatial grid used for computations .",

    "the action of the mode operators @xmath45 on the density operator can be expressed as the action of differential operators on the wigner function using the _ operator correspondences _ , which follow from eq .",
    "( [ wig1 ] )    @xmath46    the extension to many modes is straightforward .    for the restricted basis von neumann equation , eq .",
    "( [ von neumann equation ] ) , we find using these operator correspondences that the evolution of the multimode wigner function @xmath47 is given by @xmath48    this wigner function evolution is exactly equivalent to the von neumann equation , eq .",
    "( [ von neumann equation ] ) .",
    "equations of motion for the wigner function of the form given by eq .",
    "( [ wigner function evolution full ] ) are well known , particularly in quantum optics @xcite , and even in the case of a few variables are not easy to solve numerically . the _ wigner truncation _ , in which the third - order derivative terms are dropped , has often been made , since the resulting equation of motion , having only first - order derivatives on the right , is of the form of a liouville equation .",
    "it thus describes an ensemble of trajectories obeying an equation of motion which is essentially classical , and which can be simulated relatively straightforwardly .",
    "the justification for this truncation is intuitively reasonable ; if the quantum state of the system is such that it is `` almost classical '' , then the classical equation should prevail .",
    "one can present scaling arguments , in which it is assumed that the wigner function behaves like a sharply peaked probability distribution centered around a _ macroscopic _",
    "mean value of the parameters @xmath49 .",
    "these arguments can then be used to show that the contribution from the third - order derivative terms is negligible provided the mean values of _ all _ of the @xmath50 are large .",
    "this kind of argument has been made relatively rigorously by polkovnikov @xcite , who has shown how the third - order derivative terms give a correction to the classical trajectories .    in the case of colliding condensates",
    "this criterion is not valid .",
    "the initial state of the system is only highly occupied in the modes in the vicinity of the two incoming momenta , and we want to consider the evolution into a large number of initially unoccupied modes .",
    "however , experience in quantum optics shows that the wigner truncation can be valid for such a system ; the prime example is the _ degenerate parametric oscillator _ , in which two modes of the electromagnetic field are made to interact by means of a nonlinear crystal to give a hamiltonian of the form @xmath51 here @xmath52 and @xmath53 are destruction operators for field modes with frequencies @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "a wigner function treatment soon reveals an equation of motion with first- and third - order derivatives with respect to corresponding wigner function variables @xmath56 .    in the relevant physical situation ,",
    "the mode @xmath52 is initially unpopulated and the mode @xmath53 is derived from an intense laser , and as such is essentially a classical field  thus one makes the replacement @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a classical amplitude , and thus @xmath59 this approximate hamiltonian produces a wigner function equation of motion with only first - order derivatives with respect to @xmath60 , and is well verified to give accurate physical predictions for the production of quanta in the mode @xmath52 .",
    "alternatively , one could simply drop the third - order terms in the wigner function equation of motion , and one would get equivalent results in the limit that one could neglect depletion of the field @xmath53 .",
    "this is in spite of the fact that the occupation of the mode @xmath52 is not large  thus it appears that it is sufficient for only some of the modes to be highly occupied for it to be valid to drop the third - order derivative terms .",
    "the case of colliding condensates is analogous to that just discussed .",
    "there are a number of highly occupied modes  those corresponding to the original condensate packets , and a larger number of unoccupied modes . in the following we give a heuristic analysis of why the wigner truncation should be acceptable for this system .",

    "these widths reflect the asymmetry of the initial condensate wavepackets ( in velocity space ) , and are approximately 1.5 times as large as the velocity radii of the condensate wavepackets in the thomas - fermi approximation ( being 0.19  mms@xmath137 in the @xmath162 and @xmath229 directions and 0.54  mms@xmath137 in the @xmath230 direction ) . at later times , the fitted widths are found to increase anisotropically , so that by 40  ms the fitted widths are approximately 0.3  mms@xmath137 , 0.6  mms@xmath137 and 0.9  mms@xmath137 .",
    "these increases are driven by scattering events , and reflect the inverse extent of the colliding system in coordinate space ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : single run x slices ] ) .      in this section",
    "we explore the dependence of the coherent and incoherent populations on the initial condensate number and on the initial relative wavepacket speed .",
    "these parameters , which are relatively easily adjusted experimentally , are the only ones we change  all other simulation parameters , including @xmath231 , @xmath232 and the details of the simulation grids , are held fixed .",
    "we obtain the time - dependent total coherent and incoherent populations for each parameter set using the extrapolation method outlined in section  [ sssection : total populations ] . for all parameter sets two trajectories were simulated .      in fig .",
    "[ figure : populations varying parameters ]  ( a , b ) we plot the total coherent and incoherent populations for collisions at @xmath233  mms@xmath137 with total initial condensate numbers of @xmath234 . from these curves",
    "we can see that by increasing the total number of particles within the system , the amount of incoherent population generated by the collision also increases .",
    "we find that the peak rate of incoherent particle formation increases roughly linearly with @xmath235 , and that the time that this peak occurs decreases , with increasing particle number .",
    "the dashed parts of the curves for @xmath236 indicate results where the real particle density has begun to exit the simulation volume .      in fig .",
    "[ figure : populations varying parameters ]  ( c , d ) we plot the total coherent and incoherent populations for collisions with @xmath237 and @xmath238  mms@xmath137 .",
    "these curves show that the rate of incoherent population scattering increases ( again found to be roughly linearly ) with increasing relative wavepacket speed , a result which is expected from classical collisional theory @xmath239 .",
    "however , as can be seen for the curves with @xmath240  mms@xmath137 , the total amount of incoherent population generated is less strongly dependent upon @xmath241 , as the overlap time of the condensate wavepackets , and hence the period over which the major mechanism of incoherent particle formation acts , scales as @xmath242 . for the lower values of @xmath241 , broadening of the condensate wavepackets",
    "leads to the population exiting the simulation volume before packet separation .",
    "note that the the speed of sound for this system ( taken as for a homogeneous system at the peak density of the condensate at @xmath132 ) is 1.5  mms@xmath137 .",
    "the basic mechanism of halo formation is pairwise scattering of condensate particles into two distinct halo modes , which can be viewed as a four - wave mixing process .",
    "however , not all modes within the halo region exhibit population growth , a feature that can be understood in terms of the phase relationships required for growth . for plane wave modes ,",
    "the nonlinear portion of the mode amplitude evolution is @xmath243 representing a process where @xmath244 . writing the mode amplitudes as @xmath245 $ ] , the rate of population change for a single mode ( in the absence of external potentials ) is @xmath246 where @xmath247 . the phase evolution corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ population change from sde ] ) is @xmath248 at early times , the evolution of the halo modes is driven almost entirely by the condensate wavepackets , with the dominant processes being scattering events involving the destruction of one quanta from each wavepacket .",
    "the role of the phase @xmath249 is critical , as can be understood from a simplified model of four modes only , two highly occupied modes @xmath22 and @xmath250 representing the two condensate packets , and a pair of scattered modes @xmath13 and @xmath251 of lower occupation , for which @xmath252 ( in the centre of mass frame ) .",
    "initially the phase @xmath249 is randomly set , and if @xmath253 , population transfers from the pair @xmath254 into the pair @xmath255 while if @xmath256 the population transfer is in the opposite direction .",
    "the phase @xmath249 evolves towards either @xmath257 ( maximum gain for scattered modes ) or @xmath258 ( maximum loss ) , where it stabilizes while population is still available for transfer .",
    "thus some pairs @xmath259 will grow , while others will decrease in size .",
    "if @xmath260 , the phase @xmath261 can change rapidly ( see eq .",
    "( [ phase change from sde ] ) ) , possibly leading to a change in the direction of population transfer .    for the multimode case ,",
    "the main additional feature is that the scattered modes no longer need be precise momentum opposites , because of the range of momentum modes available in the condensate packets .",
    "thus for a particular scattered mode @xmath13 there is a range of possible modes near its conjugate momentum mode @xmath251 which can be convolved with the condensate packets to contribute to the growth ( or loss ) in @xmath13 , ( see eq .",
    "( [ nonlinear sde portion 1 ] ) ) .",
    "labelling this set of modes about @xmath251 as @xmath262 , then from the properties of convolution , the size of @xmath262 is about twice that of a condensate packet .",
    "there is of course a corresponding set of modes @xmath263 about @xmath13 , and if the phases and populations for a pair of modes from @xmath262 and @xmath263 are favorable for growth , these phases can quickly be locked across the regions @xmath262 and @xmath263 ( see fig  [ figure : single run phase only ] ) .",
    "population growth is a stimulated process , so while @xmath262 and @xmath263 will now grow rapidly , regions which have not established a favorable phase are left behind .",
    "we note that this discussion helps explain the incomplete pair correlation observed for halo modes @xmath13 and @xmath251 , because the scattered pair are not required to have exactly opposite momentum , due to the range of momentum modes available in the condensate packets .",
    "in this paper we have presented a complete derivation of the truncated wigner method , paying particular attention to the limits of validity of the wigner truncation . using this formalism , we have presented simulation results , both from a single trajectory and from ensembles of trajectories , of collisions between distinct bose - einstein condensate wavepackets .",
    "this formalism includes both stimulated _ and _ spontaneous processes , allowing for a complete treatment of system dynamics . in particular",
    "we have observed the generation of highly populated @xmath22-wave scattering haloes .",
    "previous treatments of similar collisional systems have been restricted to the low - scattering limit , and have not provided a complete description of the field .",
    "the most significant process not included in our treatment of these collisions is three - body recombination @xcite . in a further paper @xcite",
    "we extend the truncated wigner method to include this process , and investigate its effect on a simple system . for the colliding systems considered in this paper",
    "we have found using this extended formalism that three - body recombination has a negligible effect on the dynamics .",
    "the various forms of the truncated wigner differential equation , eqs .",
    "( [ mode space sde],[hybrid sde],[coordinate space sde ] ) , are functionally identical to the projected gross - pitaevskii equation  of davis _ et al .",
    ". however the projected gross - pitaevskii equation  treatment has been used only for relatively high temperature situations , in which the thermal fluctuations are much larger than the quantum fluctuations , whereas in the truncated wigner method the quantum mechanical nature of the system is still largely present in the form of mode amplitude fluctuations in the initial state ( see below ) .",
    "the initial state of the gross - pitaevskii equation  system would represent the limit , in the truncated wigner function method , in which the size of the quantum fluctuations becomes negligible in comparison with the size of the order parameter of the field , while keeping the number of particles in the field constant .",
    "thus the gross - pitaevskii equation  can be considered to represent the thermodynamic limit of the truncated wigner approach where spontaneous , and spontaneously initiated , processes are far less important than stimulated processes .",
    "of course the alternate approach is then simply to take the gross - pitaevskii equation , and `` seed '' each mode with a certain amount of noise , such that previously unavailable spontaneous processes become possible . while this approach would avoid some of the more complicated aspects of the truncated wigner method",
    ", one could not then make the unambiguous connections to the underlying quantum nature of the system which the truncated wigner method allows .",
