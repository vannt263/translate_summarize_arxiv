    "recent infrared measurements of dust extinction , as well as co and @xmath0 maps of the filaments in molecular clouds reveal a population of embedded cores mostly confined by the global external pressure from the inter - core gas .",
    "these cores are closely associated with the progenitors of young stellar objects . in such filaments there are gravitationally bound cores ( or pre - stellar cores ) , and embedded protostars @xcite .",
    "but , in the pipe nebula nearly all the cores are starless @xcite .",
    "only the most massive cores in pipe are gravitationally bound and might collapse .",
    "the shape of the cmf of these dense cores @xcite appears to be qualitatively similar to the broken power - law of the stellar imf @xcite .",
    "an in - depth analysis of their structure and evolution may be useful for the construction of a star formation theory .",
    "one noticeable difference between the cmf and the imf is an offset between the two distributions .",
    "the ratio of the characteristic mass of the imf over the characteristic mass of the cmf is generally smaller than unity .",
    "this ratio ranges from @xmath1 in the pipe nebula @xcite to @xmath2 in the orion @xcite and aquila nebulae @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that this offset is due to a direct one - to - one mapping from the cores to the stars with sufficient amount of mass loss during the star formation process .",
    "it is hard to explain in this scenario how the low - mass stars are produced by the originally stable low - mass cores .",
    "many studies modeling the origin of imf highlight factors such as the accretion rate of protostars , turbulent fragmentation and accretion of cores ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the meantime , constraints such as the small age spread of stars in young clusters are inconsistent in these models .",
    "we propose a scenario to explain the transition from the cmf to the imf as well as a synchronized star formation , triggered by a few first formed o / b stars in the nebula .",
    "many authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) studied the effects of uv radiation from massive stars onto the surrounding regions .",
    "the uv radiation generates a hot ionized region ( strmgren sphere ) , increasing the ambient pressure .",
    "consequently , an isothermal shock is driven through the nebula . influenced by the strmgren sphere ,",
    "denser sub - structures are rapidly enhanced and most of the pre - existing pressure confined cores are compressed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the ionization timescale is generally short compared to the hydrodynamical timescales , such that the increase in the background pressure and temperature can be considered instant in most cases .    in this work ,",
    "we develop a quantitative understanding of the consequences of this sudden change in the ambient pressure and temperature in the context of the transition from the cmf to the imf .",
    "a direct result is the reduction of the critical bonnor - ebert mass @xcite , making previous unbound cores gravitationally unstable .",
    "therefore , the whole region experiences a rapid star burst , synchronizing star formation .",
    "the shifted bonnor - ebert mass also naturally leads to the transition from the cmf distribution to the imf distribution .",
    "we base our calculations on a pipe - like cloud , with a starless cmf as the starting point of the evolution .",
    "we investigated the formation of a starless cmf in our previous work ( @xcite , hereafter h13 ) .",
    "in h13 , we suggest that , prior to the onset of global star formation , the cores and the inter - core gas are two separate phases in pressure equilibrium , which possibly result from thermal instability @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of coagulation @xcite and ablation @xcite dominate the evolution of the system and the star formation timescale is prolonged by the turbulent pressure or magnetic pressure inside the cloud @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the consequences of the ignition of the first massive stars in a starless nebula . in  2 , we suggest that the photoionization of the inter - cloud gas leads to a decrease in the critical bonnor - ebert mass and triggers a global burst of star formation .",
    "we use this reduced critical mass and the starless cmf from the pipe to obtain the transition to a stellar imf in  3 .",
    "we assume different star formation statistics , showing that uncertainties such as binary mass ratio distribution do not affect the imf shape in a certain parameter range .",
    "the discussion and conclusions are presented in  4 .",
    "after the formation of the first massive stars , their stellar luminosity has a significant influence on the subsequent evolution of the surrounding media . in the presence of a strong uv flux from nearby o / b stars , the diffuse neutral medium , originally at 100  k , hereafter referred to as the warm medium , would be ionized and heated up , while the dense molecular region , originally at 10  k , hereafter referred to as the cold medium , would still be mostly shielded .",
    "the resulting increase in the external pressure leads to a reduction in the bonnor - ebert mass of the cold cores and a decrease in the star formation timescale .",
    "the ionizing photons from the native stars create strmgren spheres in the surrounding warm medium . for a typical o / b star with an effective uv photon ( @xmath3 ) emission rate of @xmath4 ,",
    "the strmgren radius @xmath5 is determined by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the recombination coefficient @xcite .",
    "we define @xmath8 as the temperature of the warm medium in units of @xmath9k , @xmath10 as the number of uv photons in units of @xmath11 , and @xmath12 as the warm medium hydrogen number density in units of @xmath13 . within @xmath14 of the ionizing sources ,",
    "the warm medium is nearly fully ionized , with @xmath15 .",
    "this new temperature corresponds to an increase by a factor of 10@xmath16100 .",
    "more realistic calculations of equilibrium temperature have been performed with version 08.00 of cloudy ( last described by @xcite ) .",
    "the effective temperature of the central star is taken to be 34,700  k with a surface luminosity of log@xmath17 .",
    "this is a typical value for a main sequence star with a mass of @xmath18 , produced with the cambridge stellar evolution code stars @xcite . assuming a blackbody",
    ", the star emits @xmath19 of its power in hydrogen ionization photons , corresponding to @xmath20 .",
    "we assume a solar metallicity for the gas and a standard dust composition .",
    "we use a constant hydrogen density of @xmath21 to simulate the warm medium in pipe nebula , to be consistent with the values in @xcite .",
    "the results show that there is a sharp temperature dropoff from several thousand degrees to several hundred degrees at a particular depth of the cloud .",
    "the solid line in figure [ fig : cloudy(a ) ] shows the temperature of the warm medium versus the distance from the star .",
    "this indicates the strmgren radius is @xmath22 and the temperature inside the ionized sphere is around @xmath23 .",
    "given the typical size of a nebula , which is usually a few pc , only a few massive stars are needed to ionize most of the inter - core media , leading to a much higher exterior pressure .",
    "the ionizing uv flux can also penetrate into dense cores .",
    "we first consider the heating from the radiation which balances the cooling from recombination .",
    "we denote @xmath24 to be the distance from an o / b star at which a typical cold core is heated by the external radiation to 100  k. by neglecting the loss of ionizing photons from the star through the warm medium , we estimate @xmath24 from :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 with @xmath27 here is the same as in section  [ sec : ionization of warm media ] . more realistically , we compute the ionization in the cold core with cloudy , using the same setup as in  2.1 , but this time with an initial hydrogen density @xmath21 in the range of @xmath28 , while @xmath29 from @xmath30 to faraway , corresponding to the cold medium placed @xmath30 from the central star , and the warm medium filling the space in between .",
    "then instead of keeping constant density , we keep the two media in pressure equilibrium , as the central star illuminates its surroundings . in this case",
    ", the density of the cold medium is enhanced rapidly , due to the sudden increase of warm medium temperature and pressure . after the attenuation of the warm medium ,",
    "the typical photon penetration depth inside the cold medium is only about @xmath31 .",
    "this is much smaller than the typical core radius @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , only cores very near the massive star or very small cores are subjected to this effect .",
    "the temperature inside the cores further away is limited by the cooling process to be around 1520 k , which is two times higher than before the ignition of the uv flux ( see figure [ fig : cloudy(b ) ] , for @xmath33 ) .",
    "in addition , we also investigate the classical evaporation of cores due to the high temperature environment . using the formula for the evaporation rate of clouds embedded in a @xmath9  k gas @xcite , with the limitations that the background gas is either fully ionized or neutral , @xmath34 here",
    ", @xmath35 is the environment temperature , @xmath36 is the boltzmann s constant , @xmath37 is the radius of the core in units of pc , @xmath38 is the neutral conductivity , @xmath39 is the classical conductivity for a fully ionized gas .",
    "is used for the two cases . ] for a typical core with mass @xmath40 , the evaporation timescale therefore is @xmath41 in the neutral case and @xmath42 in the fully ionized case .",
    "based on these calculations , the classical evaporation only affects cores with radius as small as @xmath43 .",
    "we conclude from the above calculation that the evaporation effect is negligible .",
    "this is understandable as both the recombination timescale and cooling timescale inside the cold medium are much shorter than these timescales inside the warm gas due to their density contrast .",
    "therefore , the ionization fraction and temperature of the cold medium can be maintained at low levels .",
    "we do not include the change of the imf due to the evaporation in the calculation below .",
    "the star formation timescale in general can be as long as @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "however , the collapse process is speeded up considerably by the compression of the dense cores due to the uv feedback @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the enhancement of the external pressure reduces the bonnor - ebert mass and induces the formation of low - mass stars .",
    "the bonnor - ebert mass of a cold core can be expressed as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the external pressure ( see also equation(4 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "prior to the formation of a massive star , the temperature of the warm medium is @xmath47 , and the cores temperature is @xmath48 . in a pressure equilibrium ,",
    "the density contrast between the cores and medium is @xmath49 .",
    "the influx of the uv photons from an emerging massive star ionizes the tenuous warm medium within a pc from the star and raises the medium s temperature to @xmath50 .",
    "in contrast , the temperature within the cores remains at @xmath51 ( see fig [ fig : cloudy ] ) .",
    "the ionization front propagates through the warm medium more rapidly than the sound speed .",
    "consequently , the increase in @xmath52 leads to an increase in @xmath46 by a similar factor before the medium s density can readjust to a new pressure equilibrium . due to the combined effect of the temperature and pressure increase in both the warm medium and the cold medium ,",
    "the bonnor - ebert mass decreases by a factor of 2.38 , shifting from around @xmath53 @xcite to @xmath54 in our model .    due to this sudden increase of the external pressure , global , coordinated star formation",
    "is induced , leading to a star burst .",
    "several factors may introduce some dispersions in the value of the modified @xmath55 .",
    "for example , the flux of ionizing photons emitted by the first o / b star would be reduced by an order of magnitude if its mass is halved ( the one we have considered in figure [ fig : cloudy ] is @xmath56 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the final temperature of the ionized region and the core only change slightly .",
    "the bonnor - ebert mass associated with slightly lower @xmath52 ( @xmath57 ) and @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) would reduce @xmath55 to @xmath60 . in this case , the strmgren sphere around the star will be much smaller , which would slow down the global star formation process and extend the age spread in this nebula .",
    "if the global star formation timescale is comparable or longer than the timescale of core coagulation , the dynamics of cores may affect the imf further . here",
    ", we neglect this effect on the age spread and the effect from the evolution of cores .",

    "<S> the origin of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is a fundamental issue in the theory of star formation . </S>",
    "<S> it is generally fitted with a composite power - law . </S>",
    "<S> some clues on the progenitors can be found in dense starless cores which have a core mass function ( cmf ) with similar shape . in the low - mass end </S>",
    "<S> , these mass functions increase with mass , albeit the sample may be somewhat incomplete , whereas they decrease with mass in the high - mass end . </S>",
    "<S> there is an offset in the turn - over mass between the two mass distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the stellar mass for the imf peak is lower than the corresponding core mass for the cmf peak in the pipe nebula by about a factor of three . </S>",
    "<S> smaller offsets are found between the imf and the cmfs in other nebulae . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the offset is likely to be induced during a star - burst episode of global star formation which is triggered by the formation of a few o / b stars in the multi - phase media , which is naturally emerged by the onset of a thermal instability in the cloud - core formation process . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the scenario that the ignition of a few massive stars photoionizes the warm medium between the cores , increases the external pressure , reduces their bonnor - ebert mass and triggers the collapse of some previously stable cores . </S>",
    "<S> we quantitatively reproduce the imf in the low - mass end with the assumption of additional rotational fragmentation . </S>"
