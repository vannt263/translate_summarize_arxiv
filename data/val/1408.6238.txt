    "the latter approach is available only for particular types of topologically ordered systems with non - abelian anyonic excitations .",

    "the qubit color code  @xcite is defined on a trivalent lattice whose plaquettes are 3-colorable ( see for example fig .  [ f:2colexes ] ) .",
    "such lattices are called 2-colexes  @xcite .",
    "qubits are placed on vertices of the 2-colex , and each plaquette has two associated projectors , defined as @xmath2 such that @xmath3 runs over vertices bounding the plaquette @xmath4 , and where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the pauli matrices acting on vertex @xmath7 .",
    "2-colexes are always bipartite , which means that all cycles of the lattice are even in length , and so @xmath8 and @xmath9 commute with each other for the same @xmath4 . it can also be seen that @xmath10=0\\;\\forall p , p'$ ] .",
    "the model is then defined by the hamiltonian @xmath11      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] such that the ground space of the code is the common @xmath12 eigenspace of each of the @xmath13 operators .",
    "we will therefore refer to the @xmath14 and @xmath15 as @xmath16- and @xmath17-type stabilizers .",
    "plaquettes of the 2-colex are colored red , green , and blue , and similarly each link has an associated color , such that it connects two plaquettes of its own color .",
    "the elementary excitations of this model can be thought of as ( abelian ) anyonic quasiparticles , corresponding to stabilizer operators that are frustrated .",
    "anyon species can be labelled by the color of the plaquette on which they live and the type of stabilizer they frustrate ( i.e. @xmath16 or @xmath17 ) , or can be a composite of these generating anyons .    on a torus the qubit color codes are @xmath18-fold degenerate , and alternative boundary conditions for these codes are discussed further in sec .",
    "[ s : boundary ] .",
    "logical operators in these codes consist of homologically non - trivial strings of @xmath16 or @xmath17 operators running along edges of a particular color , and can branch if strings along edges of all three colors meet .",
    "a @xmath16 string running along red links will anticommute with a @xmath17 string running along blue links , for example , and these string operators will form a pauli algebra acting on the degenerate codespace .",
    "we can think of the qubit color code as being based on the group @xmath1 .",
    "the qubits on each link have a natural basis labelled by elements of @xmath19 ( with @xmath20 the identity element ) and we can consider the @xmath16 operator to act on these states as group multiplication by the @xmath21 element , i.e. @xmath22 where of course addition modulo 2 is the relevant group multiplication operation for this group .",
    "the @xmath16 operator can also be labelled with a group element superscript such that @xmath23 and see that @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "let us also introduce operators @xmath26 for each @xmath27 .",
    "this allows us to write @xmath28    in particular , this allows us to rewrite @xmath29 where we use notation such that @xmath30 runs over all sets of @xmath31 such that @xmath32 .",
    "when written in this form , these operators bear a close resemblance to the @xmath33 and @xmath34 projectors used to define the quantum double models  @xcite ( in this case for the group @xmath1 ) .      given our interpretation of the qubit color code in terms of the group structure of @xmath1 , we now define a generalized color code .",
    "the desirable characteristics of this code are that its hamiltonian can be expressed as a ( negative ) sum of commuting local projectors , and that its excitation spectra includes non - abelian anyons for sufficiently complicated group @xmath0 .",
    "the models we present will satisfy both of these conditions .",
    "it is worth noting that our models defined for the ( abelian ) cyclic groups @xmath35 will correspond precisely to the known generalizations of color codes to higher - dimensional spins  @xcite .",
    "a @xmath0-color code is defined uniquely by the following set of data :    * a finite group @xmath0 * a 2-colex @xmath36 * a parity function @xmath37 at each site @xmath7 of @xmath36 * a choice of privileged color ( conventionally red ) , and a choice of `` clockwise '' and `` anti - clockwise '' for the remaining colors ( conventionally green and blue respectively )    here we will begin by defining the model for the special case @xmath38 , and subsequently describe how to relate models with different parity functions @xmath39 . to each vertex of the 2-colex @xmath36 ,",
    "we associate a qudit with dimension @xmath40 and an orthonormal basis labelled by elements @xmath41 .",
    "define operators corresponding to group multiplication and projection that act at a site as follows @xmath42    as compared to the qubit case , a general group requires a distinction between left and right multiplication , hence we have introduced both @xmath43 and @xmath44 to distinguish these two operations .",
    "note that @xmath45=0 $ ] , though @xmath46\\neq 0\\neq [ x_-^g , x_-^h]$ ] in general .",
    "a further group theoretic concept that will be useful is the commutator subgroup @xmath47 = \\left<[g , h]:g , h\\in g\\right>$ ] where @xmath48 = g^{-1}h^{-1}gh$ ] .",
    "this subgroup is normal , and the quotient group @xmath49 $ ] is the abelianization of @xmath0 .",
    "a particularly useful property of @xmath47 $ ] is that it can alternatively be defined as the set of elements in @xmath0 which can be written as some product @xmath50 that may be reordered such that it evaluates to identity .    in analogy to the qubit color code ,",
    "the @xmath0-color codes are specified by a number of stabilizer operators . as in the qubit case",
    ", each plaquette will have an associated @xmath16- and @xmath17-type stabilizer .",
    "however , in general , the form of these stabilizers will depend on the color of the plaquette under consideration . with this in mind",
    ", we can define @xmath16-type stabilizers for a plaquette as follows @xmath51 where in eq .",
    "( [ e : rightleftchoice ] ) the @xmath52 operator acts either as left ( @xmath53 ) or right ( @xmath54 ) multiplication depending on the relative orientation of the three colors at a given site .",
    "explicitly , when considering the @xmath16-type stabilizer corresponding to a blue or green plaquette , if the colors of plaquettes around a vertex are ordered @xmath55 when traversed clockwise , then the operator appearing at that vertex will be of the form @xmath43 . similarly ,",
    "if the plaquette colors around the vertex are ordered @xmath56 when traversed clockwise , then the operator appearing at that vertex will take the form @xmath44 .",
    "when considering red plaquettes , these conventions are reversed , so that @xmath55 clockwise ordering corresponds to @xmath44 and @xmath56 corresponds to @xmath43 .",
    "concrete examples of these conventions are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : stabconvention ] .",
    "these conventions are chosen so that the @xmath14 operators corresponding to plaquettes of the privileged color ( red ) commute with the @xmath14 for both blue and green plaquettes .",
    "making all three colored @xmath16-type stabilizers commute pairwise is impossible , and so the blue and green @xmath14 will not generally commute with each other for neighbouring plaquettes .",
    "although this may seem at first glance to be a severe problem , it so happens that there exists a common @xmath12 eigenspace of all @xmath14 regardless .",
    "the @xmath17-type stabilizers for each of the three plaquette color are then defined as @xmath57}\\prod_{i\\in p } t^{g_i}(i)\\label{e : szdefr}\\\\              s^z_{p,\\mathrm{blue}}&=\\sum_{\\prod_{\\mathrm{acw } } g_i = e}\\prod_{i\\in p } t^{g_i}(i)\\\\              s^z_{p,\\mathrm{green}}&=\\sum_{\\prod_{\\mathrm{cw } } g_i = e}\\prod_{i\\in p } t^{g_i}(i)\\label{e : szdefg }          \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the acw or cw denotes the product being taken anti - clockwise or clockwise around the plaquette , respectively .",
    "the origin of the product can easily be seen not to affect these operators .",
    "additionally , the order of multiplication in @xmath58 does not affect the outcome . since @xmath47 $ ] can be defined as the set of elements that can be decomposed into a product @xmath59 such that it can be rearranged to evaluate to identity , whether or not some product of elements @xmath60 is in @xmath47 $ ] will be independent of the order of multiplication .",
    "when considering these @xmath17-type stabilizers , it is clear the sense in which the red plaquettes are privileged .",
    "their structure is not related to the full group @xmath0 .",
    "rather , we can consider @xmath47 $ ] as the preimage of the identity element of @xmath49 $ ] under the quotient map .",
    "thus the structure of the red @xmath17-type stabilizer is derived from that of the abelianization of @xmath0 , as opposed to @xmath0 itself .",
    "for this reason , we will sometimes refer to red plaquettes as `` abelianized '' .",
    "it should also be clear why we identified blue and green plaquettes as `` anticlockwise '' and `` clockwise '' respectively .",
    "the reason that we have defined the orderings of products in @xmath15 operators as above is that this allows these operators to commute with all the @xmath14 , as can easily be verified .",
    "that we are unable to preserve this commutativity without abelianizing the red plaquettes can be seen as a consequence of the fact that the blue and green @xmath14 fail to commute .",
    "it is impossible to preserve the full group structure of the red plaquette and have its @xmath15 commute with both the blue and green @xmath14 . in order to avoid this non - commutativity ,",
    "we have reverted to the simpler structure of the abelianization of @xmath0 , where no such problems exist , for the red plaquettes .    in abelianizing the red plaquette @xmath17-stabilizers , we have introduced an additional extensive degeneracy to the system .",
    "this degeneracy is local in the sense that it can be lifted through the addition of an extra class of local stabilizer operator that has no counterpart in the qubit case ( or in fact for any abelian @xmath0-color code ) , where @xmath47=\\{e\\}$ ] .",
    "we call these @xmath61-type stabilizers , and they are defined for each red link as @xmath62|}\\sum_{n\\in [ g , g]}c_{l,\\mathrm{red}}(n)\\\\              c_{l,\\mathrm{red}}(n ) & = x_+^n(l,\\uparrow)\\otimes x_-^n(l,\\downarrow )          \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 acts on the upper ( @xmath64 ) or lower ( @xmath65 ) qudit of the red link @xmath66 after it has been oriented such that the blue plaquette ( acw ) is on the left of the link and the green plaquette ( cw ) on the right",
    ". it can be seen that the @xmath67 will commute with all @xmath15 and @xmath14 . by requiring the ground space to be in the @xmath12 eigenspace of the @xmath67 as well as the @xmath15 and @xmath14 ,",
    "the local degeneracies caused by abelianization of the red plaquettes are lifted .    as noted ,",
    "the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath67 stabilizers as written do not commute ( as the @xmath14 do not in general commute ) .",
    "they nonetheless can be cast in the monomial stabilizer framework  @xcite , and have an associated frustration free ground space .",
    "however , commutativity can be restored by restricting the @xmath14 stabilizers for green and blue plaquettes to the @xmath12 eigenspace of the @xmath67 .",
    "these modified stabilizers take the form @xmath68 where @xmath69 denotes all red links bounding the plaquette @xmath4 .",
    "this will then give a set of commutative stabilizer operators generated by the @xmath15 , @xmath70 and @xmath67 operators , allowing us to write the hamiltonian of a @xmath0-color code as @xmath71    the ground space will be the common @xmath12 eigenspace of all the stabilizer operators , and will be protected from excited states by a constant gap .",
    "this completes the definition of the @xmath0-color code for the special case that the parity function is set to @xmath72 at every site @xmath7 of the lattice .",
    "the parity at a given site may be reversed by making the unitary transformation @xmath73 at that site .",
    "this completely exhausts the freedom we have in choosing the @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath67 consistently . when viewed in this way",
    ", we can see the parity function as being analogous to the edge direction in the quantum double models , where reversing an edge is equivalent to applying the unitary taking @xmath74 on that edge .",
    "we will henceforth restrict to the @xmath72 parity case , with the understanding that all results will hold for any possible alternative parity choice .",
    "a property of the qubit color code that will be particularly useful to us in understanding the @xmath0-color code is that it is locally equivalent to 2 copies of the toric code  @xcite .",
    "we will now sketch an alternative proof of this fact ( for a particular 2-colex ) and demonstrate how it generalizes to a general @xmath0-color code .",
    "before we present the mapping between the color code and the toric code , we first briefly review the toric code  @xcite . for our purposes , it is sufficient to define the toric code on a square lattice , with qubits on edges . as in the color code",
    ", this model is defined by a number of stabilizer operators .",
    "explicitly , for each vertex @xmath76 and plaquette @xmath4 of the lattice , we have @xmath77 where we use notation such that @xmath78 runs over all qubits incident to @xmath76 , and @xmath79 runs over all qubits bordering @xmath4 . the toric code hamiltonian is then given by @xmath80 in a very similar fashion to the color code .    for simplicity , we present a mapping between the color code and two copies of the toric code on a particular 2-colex .",
    "specifically , we consider the 4.8.8 lattice , where the square plaquettes are colored green and the octagonal plaquettes blue and red in such a way as to satisfy 3-colorability ( fig .",
    "[ f:488lattice ] ) .",
    "we will show how to interpret a qubit color code on this 2-colex as 2 copies of the toric code .",
    "that is , we will find a local unitary map that transforms color code stabilizers to toric code stabilizers or actions on uncoupled ancilla systems .",
    "intuitively , the mapping we present treats each green plaquette as 2 encoded qubits , one belonging to each copy of the toric code .",
    "the blue plaquettes will correspond to vertices ( plaquettes ) of the first ( second ) copy of the toric code , while the red plaquettes will correspond to plaquettes ( vertices ) of the first ( second ) copy of the toric code ( see fig .",
    "[ f : toriccolorcorrespond ] ) .",
    "consider the 4 qubits belonging to each green plaquettes as a stabilizer code with a 4-fold degenerate codespace .",
    "the stabilizers of this code are simply the green face stabilizers of the color code , i.e. @xmath81 where we use a graphical notation for the 4 operators acting on the vertices of the green plaquette , so that @xmath82 on the 4 relevant qubits .",
    "this 4-dimensional codespace corresponding to each green plaquette can be considered as 2 encoded qubits , one for each copy of the toric code . in this way",
    ", the qubits of the new toric code lattices have a direct correspondence to the green plaquettes of the color code lattice .",
    "it will now be convenient to bipartition these green plaquettes into those with red plaquettes on their right and left ( @xmath83-type ) and those with red plaquettes above and below them ( @xmath76-type ) .",
    "on @xmath83-type green plaquettes , encoded pauli algebras can be defined for each of the 2 encoded qubits as @xmath84 where @xmath85 acts as pauli @xmath16 on the @xmath86 encoded qubit for the @xmath83-type green plaquette under consideration .    for @xmath76-type green plaquettes ,",
    "the encoded operators can be defined by @xmath87 that is , on @xmath76-type plaquettes , the definitions of the first and second encoded qubits are exchanged .",
    "note that these definitions are not unique .",
    "in particular , because the codespace is the @xmath12 eigenspace of @xmath88 and @xmath89 , multiplying any operator by @xmath90 or @xmath91 is a trivial operation , and so the encoded operators are invariant under @xmath92 rotations .",
    "one could more rigorously define the unitary enacting this encoding as a function from operators on the 4 qubits of each green plaquette to the 2 encoded ( toric code ) qubits , as well as 2 ancilla qubits .",
    "notably , this transformation would take green color code stabilizers to an action on the ancilla space , and so they become `` trivial '' in the sense of ref .",

    "the action of the color code stabilizers for blue and red plaquettes is @xmath93 if we interpret the lattices of the two toric codes as in fig .",
    "[ f : toriccolorcorrespond ] .",
    "thus the unitary we have described maps all the stabilizers of the original color code model to stabilizers of the toric code model , or operators on uncoupled ancilla qubits .",
    "this completes the demonstration of equivalence .",
    "the equivalence between the qubit color code and the toric code on the 4.8.8 lattice shown above can be generalized to an equivalence between the @xmath0-color code and 2 quantum double models .",
    "however , as compared to the qubit case ( which corresponds to @xmath94 ) , the two quantum double models will in general be different .",
    "one will be based on the group @xmath0 , while the other will be based on the abelianization of the group @xmath49 $ ] .    before we continue , we briefly review the quantum double models  @xcite . conventionally , these models are defined on a directed lattice , with edge direction playing a similar role to our parity function .",

    "notably , this includes non - abelian anyons for non - abelian @xmath0 .    in general , since the anyons of a quantum double model for group @xmath0 are given by the irreducible representations of the drinfeld double of @xmath0 , @xmath115 , we would expect from this line of reasoning that the anyonic content of a @xmath0-color code is given by @xmath116))$ ] .",
    "anyonic charges of the quantum double models can be created and moved by ribbon operators  @xcite .",
    "each of these ribbon operators must have a corresponding ribbon operator creating or moving the analogous charges on the @xmath0-color code . given these operators",
    ", we could imagine braiding charges in the @xmath0-color code corresponding to any desired braiding in a quantum double model .",
    "in particular , we could perform braiding of a non - abelian anyons that implements universal quantum computation in @xmath0-color codes for @xmath0 non - nilpotent  @xcite .",
    "a concrete motivation for demonstrating equivalence between two topological models is that it allows decoding or error correcting routines for one model to apply to a broader class of models  @xcite . in our case , this amounts to the observation that a @xmath0-color code can be decoded if an equivalent procedure for decoding the quantum double model for group @xmath0 is known .",
    "although decoding for these non - abelian anyon models has yet to be explicitly demonstrated ( though related work has been shown  @xcite ) , by equating our @xmath0-color codes to the well established quantum double models , we can exploit any results in terms of decoding that are available for them .",
    "@xcite shows that all pauli stabilizer codes are equivalent to copies of the toric code .",
    "the fact that we are able to demonstrate equivalence between quantum double models and our @xmath0-color codes suggests that a more general equivalence may hold whenever the models are constructed from commuting projectors based on the @xmath16 and @xmath96 operator algebra for a group @xmath0 .",
    "this may also point to a useful restriction of the monomial stabilizer formalism  @xcite when the desired algebra structure is related to a particular group .",
    "note that we have technically not demonstrated equivalence between an arbitrary @xmath0-color code and quantum double models , as our mapping is specifically tailored to the 4.8.8 lattice .",
    "this was sufficient to prove that the @xmath0-color codes are capable in principle of supporting quantum double anyons , but we have not shown that this is true for a general lattice .",
    "however , the general principles of topologically ordered systems suggest that the microscopic lattice details should not affect global properties of the system such as its anyon spectrum , and so we feel confident in taking this correspondence to hold in general .",
    "as is generic for topological codes , the degeneracy of a particular code is highly dependent on the topology of the surface in which it is embedded , or , in the planar case , the particular choice of boundary conditions . on",
    "closed ( orientable ) manifolds , this degeneracy is independent of the microscopic details and can be derived from the anyon spectrum  @xcite .",
    "this means that the degeneracy of the @xmath0-color codes on closed manifold can directly be calculated as the degeneracy of the quantum double model for @xmath114 $ ] .",
    "similarly , characterization of the possible gapped boundaries for topologically ordered models is based on the anyon spectrum rather than microscopic details .",
    "possible boundary types and their properties can thus be found by appealing to the known results for the quantum double models  @xcite .",
    "since this theory is already well established in general , there is no reason to delve into it here .",
    "however , before moving on we will briefly discuss some special boundary types that are natural in the context of the color codes , and planar codes that can be constructed from them .    the most common planar qubit color codes are triangular  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ f : cctribound ] ) .",
    "each side of the triangle is associated with the color not appearing in plaquettes on that boundary .",
    "these triangular color codes encode one qubit .",
    "small triangular color codes have been experimentally prepared and manipulated  @xcite .",
    "another common form of planar color code is rectangular , as in fig .",
    "[ f : ccrectbound ] . in this case , two logical qubits are encoded .",
    "more generally , a natural boundary for the color code is labelled by a color according to the color not appearing on plaquettes at that boundary .",
    "degeneracy is introduced to the system when the lattice boundary consists of several different colored segments .",
    "although these boundaries arise naturally in the study of color codes , they are not the only boundary types that can occur . in particular , note that the number of boundary types we have just described is 3 ( labelled by colors ) , while a topologically ordered model equivalent to two copies of the toric code can give rise to 6 types of boundary  @xcite ) .",
    "the reason that the boundaries we described are particularly natural is that they require no special modification to the stabilizer operators ( only the 2-colex on which the model is defined ) .    in the general case of a @xmath0-color code ,",
    "the effect of boundaries is a little more complicated due to the asymmetry between the three colors ( and of course the more complicated algebraic structure ) .",
    "as before , degeneracy is introduced to the codespace when more than two distinct boundaries exist , but the counting of this degeneracy depends on the color ( or type ) of the boundaries . since the general case can be determined by appealing to results for the quantum double models , we will simply describe the logical operators and degeneracy of three distinct planar @xmath0-color codes : the blue - green rectangular codes ( i.e.  one with alternating blue and green boundaries as shown in fig .  [",
    "f : ccrectbound ] ) , the blue - red rectangular codes , and the triangular codes . up to the equivalence between the blue - red rectangular code and a green - red rectangular code",
    ", this exhausts all possible rectangular and triangular codes .    in order to describe the logical operators in these codes explicitly",
    ", it would be necessary to construct ribbon operators as in the quantum double models  @xcite , which is straightforward but tedious .",
    "instead , we will simply state the types of logical operators that arise and their relationships in order to calculate the degeneracy of these codes .      before discussing the logical operators of these codes ,",
    "we should quickly note a subtlety in their definition . at each corner between a blue and green edge",
    ", there is a red plaquette with one qudit that touches neither green nor blue plaquettes .",
    "this qudit should be understood to have a @xmath61-type stabilizer associated with it , as would be the case if there were an edge emanating from this qudit .    between the two blue boundaries of this code ,",
    "it is possible to construct a set of @xmath16-type operators labelled by group elements in @xmath0 that we call @xmath117 .",
    "these would ( largely ) run along blue links of the lattice .",
    "however , note that along a green boundary , the distinction between blue links and red links disappears . thus along this boundary , we can construct a family of operators from @xmath61-type stabilizers , each labelled by @xmath108 $ ] that runs along blue links connecting the blue boundaries .",
    "after accounting for equivalence up to these operators , only blue @xmath16-type logical operators labelled by @xmath105 $ ] are independent .",
    "similarly we can construct a set of independent green logical @xmath16 operators labelled by @xmath105 $ ] , @xmath118 .",
    "these operators will commute pairwise .",
    "we can also construct @xmath17- ( or @xmath96)-type logical operators between the blue boundaries .",
    "however , if we were to construct an entire set @xmath119 labelled by each @xmath41 , these would not commute with the stabilizers .",
    "instead , we can only construct independent representatives labelled by each @xmath105 $ ] .",
    "similar considerations apply to the @xmath120 .",
    "we can then form two pairs of logical qudit algebras generated by @xmath118 with @xmath121 and @xmath122 with @xmath120 for @xmath105 $ ] .",
    "we thus say the logical qudits associated with each of these sets of operators are abelianized .",
    "the total degeneracy is @xmath106|^2 $ ] .      as in the blue - green rectangular code",
    ", we can define @xmath117",
    ". however , since there is no green boundary , these are now independent for all @xmath41 .",
    "in contrast , red @xmath16-type logical operators are only defined for each @xmath105 $ ] ( again due to equivalence under @xmath61-type stabilizers ) .",
    "conversely , the red @xmath17-type operators are defined for each @xmath41 , while the blue @xmath17-type operators are only independently defined for each @xmath105 $ ] .",
    "this leads to logical qudit algebras generated by @xmath117 with @xmath123 for each @xmath41 and @xmath124 with @xmath121 for each @xmath105 $ ] . in this case",

    "topological defects can play an important role in topological systems .",
    "in particular , braiding of certain types of defects can implement quantum computation ( through code deformation ) in much the same way as braiding of anyons .",
    "particular types of topological defects such as holes  @xcite and twists  @xcite have been developed for this purpose in simple models such as the toric codes or qubit color codes .",
    "as with our discussion of the anyon spectrum of @xmath0-color codes , we can import many known results from quantum double models into our study of topological defects in these models , taking the equivalence between quantum doubles and @xmath0-color codes to be general ( i.e.  independent of the details of the lattice ) .",
    "the theory of topological defects is closely related to the theory of boundaries .",

    "finally , condensation is a mechanism via which the topological order in an anyonic model can be changed . in a condensed phase",
    ", the anyon density for a particular species is given a non - trivial value in the ground space , and this can lead to interesting effects , e.g.  confinement of other anyon species .",
    "condensation amounts to a deformation in the bulk of the model under consideration and again an analogy can be drawn to equivalent processes in quantum double models as studied in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these kinds of effects may also be used to perform quantum computation by manipulating the regions of condensed phases  @xcite .",
    "one feature of the qubit color codes that is particularly appealing is its large set of transversal gates  @xcite ( in comparison to the toric code , for example ) .",
    "in fact , this feature is inherited for the color codes based on abelian groups  @xcite .",
    "the most important transversal gate that these abelian color codes possess is the hadamard gate .",
    "however , as discussed in  @xcite , operator algebras based on finite non - abelian groups will not have a counterpart to the hadamard gate , due to the inequivalence of the group algebra and the corresponding representation algebra .    in a similar vein , logical operators for codes with similar algebraic structure to the @xmath0-color codes ( significantly the quantum double models )",
    "do not generally have large transversal gate sets .",
    "the transversal `` string''-like logical operators that appear for abelian groups generally become non - transversal `` ribbon '' operators in this context  @xcite when the topological charges of the model become non - abelian ( and thus able to perform quantum computation by braiding ) . for these reasons",
