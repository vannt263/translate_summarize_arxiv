    "one important quantity controlling the physics of dislocations is their elastic energy .",
    "it is defined as the integral of the elastic energy density over the whole volume except a small core region surrounding the dislocation line .",
    "this excludes the region around the dislocation core where elasticity does not apply because of the too high strains . using gauss theorem ,",
    "the elastic energy can be decomposed in two contributions :    * the one corresponding to an integration along the dislocation cut of the work necessary to create the dislocation .",
    "as it is well known , this contribution varies with the logarithm of a characteristic distance of the dislocation microstructure . * the contribution arising from the work done by the tractions exerted on the tube which isolates the dislocation core .",
    "the corresponding contribution to the elastic energy is known as the contribution of the core tractions .",
    "this last contribution is sometimes forgotten .",
    "indeed , the cut contribution is usually the dominant one .",
    "moreover , the core traction contribution disappears when one tries to define the elastic energy of an isolated infinite straight dislocation because of the external cylinder that has to be introduced to prevent the elastic energy from diverging . nevertheless , if one wants the dislocation elastic energy to be a state variable , _",
    "i.e._a variable that only depends on the current state and not on the transformation path used to reach this state , both contributions need to be taken into account .",
    "bullough and foreman @xcite already showed that the elastic energy of a dislocation loop does not depend on the hypothetical creation mechanism only when both contributions are considered .",
    "lothe and hirth @xcite also noticed that the definition of the elastic energy of a straight dislocation could not be consistent with the work of the peach - koehler forces if the contribution of the core tractions was not included in the elastic energy .",
    "finally , gavazza and barnett @xcite showed that the dislocation elastic energy part associated with the core tractions leads to a contribution to the self - force acting on a dislocation loop .    despite its importance ,",
    "no analytical expressions of the core traction contribution to the elastic energy seems to exist in the literature when the elastic anisotropy is considered .",
    "the anisotropic linear elasticity theory of dislocations has been developed in the past sixty years .",
    "eshelby , read and shockley @xcite were the first to express the anisotropic elastic field created by a straight infinite dislocation .",
    "their formalism was then enriched by stroh @xcite , leading to what is known as the sextic formalism .",
    "latter , it was shown that the elastic field of a dislocation of arbitrary shape can be obtained from the fields of straight infinite dislocations .",
    "but no expression of the contribution of the core tractions to the elastic energy has been obtained until now .",
    "the variation of this contribution with a rotation of the dislocation cut is known @xcite .",
    "it actually corresponds to the angular dependence of the interaction energy between two dislocations derived by stroh @xcite .",
    "but an expression of the absolute value of this contribution is not available .",
    "such an analytical expression exists under the assumption that the elastic constants are isotropic @xcite . the few studies that considered the elastic anisotropy as well as the contribution of the core tractions @xcite calculated this contribution with a numerical integration along the surface of the core cylinder .",
    "it is the purpose of this article to obtain an analytical expression of this contribution in the framework of the sextic formalism .",
    "such an expression could be used then in further studies .",
    "potential applications are the extraction from atomic simulations of dislocation energy properties like core energies @xcite , calculations of dislocation loop self energy @xcite , or computation of the self - force acting on a dislocation loop @xcite .",
    "such an application is presented in this article where core energies of edge dislocation in @xmath0-iron are determined .    in the first section",
    ", we define the elastic energy of a straight dislocation so as to clearly make appear the contribution of the core tractions .",
    "we then use isotropic elasticity to illustrate this definition and highlight the importance of this contribution for the coherency of the elastic energy definition .",
    "the analytical expression of the core traction contribution within anisotropic linear elasticity is obtained in the following section using the sextic formalism .",
    "we finally illustrate the consistency of our results by studying edge dislocations in @xmath0-iron and calculating their core energies with different simulation methods .",
    "we assume in this article that the elastic field created by a dislocation can be reduced to the volterra solution .",
    "et al_.@xcite have indeed shown that a straight dislocation in an infinite elastic medium creates in a point defined by its cylindrical coordinates @xmath1 and @xmath2 a displacement given by the laurent series @xmath3 the two first terms of this series , @xmath4 correspond to the volterra solution : this describes the elastic field of the dislocation far enough from its core .",
    "the remaining terms of the series ( @xmath5 ) are the dislocation core field @xcite , which arises from non - linearities in the crystal elastic behavior and from perturbations due to the atomic nature of the core .",
    "we do not consider this part of the elastic field in our definition of the dislocation elastic energy ( @xmath6 @xmath7 ) and take only the volterra solution .",
    "the elastic field creates nevertheless tractions on the surface which isolates the dislocation core . as a consequence , a contribution of the core tractions to the dislocation elastic energy exists even when the dislocation core field is neglected .",
    "as it will be shown below , this contribution needs to be considered so as to obtain an unambiguous definition of the dislocation elastic energy .",
    "we first consider an isolated dislocation .",
    "two cylinders centered on the dislocation need to be introduced so as to define the elastic energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dislo]a ) .",
    "the inner cylinder of surface @xmath8 isolates the dislocation core .",
    "strains are much too high close to the dislocation core to be described by elasticity theory . as a consequence",
    ", elastic fields are diverging at the origin and one needs to exclude the core region from the elastic description . as the elastic energy integrated on an infinite volume tends to infinity , one also needs the external cylinder to prevent the elastic energy from diverging .",
    "the dislocation elastic energy per unit - length of dislocation is thus defined in the volume @xmath9 comprised between both cylinders @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are respectively the stress and strain created by the dislocation .",
    "the use of gauss theorem allows to transform this volume integral into a surface integral : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a surface enclosing the volume @xmath9 and isolating any discontinuity of the elastic displacement @xmath15 generated by the dislocation .",
    "a dislocation is by definition the frontier of a surface that has been sheared by the burgers vector @xmath16 .",
    "a displacement discontinuity therefore occurs on the dislocation cut which needs to be isolated by the surfaces @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dislo]a ) .",
    "we would like to stress that this cut does not necessary correspond to the dislocation glide plane .",
    "the surface appearing in the integral [ eq : elas_energy_s ] is then composed of @xmath8 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the integrals along the surfaces @xmath20 and @xmath19 cancel because the resultant of forces located in the core is null , and the normals to the surfaces @xmath20 and @xmath19 have an opposite orientation @xcite . as a consequence , the elastic energy of an isolated dislocation integrated between the cylinders of radii @xmath21 and @xmath22 is limited to the contribution corresponding to the dislocation cut , leading to the the well - known result @xmath23 where the tensor @xmath24 only depends on the elastic constants , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are respectively the radii of the inner and external cylinders .",
    "we consider then an isolated dislocation dipole",
    ". the first dislocation of burgers vector @xmath16 is located at the origin and the second one of burgers vector @xmath25 at the point defined by its cylindrical coordinates @xmath26 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dislo]b ) .",
    "the two dislocation cuts need to be orientated so that the displacement discontinuity cancel except in the surface bounded by both dislocations .",
    "this ensures that no displacement discontinuity occurs far from the dipole and allows the dipole to be mechanically isolated .",
    "the elastic energy created by the dipole in the infinite volume is then @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the stresses created by each dislocation , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 the corresponding elastic displacements .",
    "the integration surface is composed of the two cylinders @xmath32 and @xmath33 of radii @xmath21 removing the elastic divergence at the dislocation cores , and of the two surfaces @xmath18 and @xmath17 removing the displacement discontinuity along the dislocation cut ( fig .  [",
    "fig : dislo]b ) .",
    "one does not need to introduce an external surface like for the isolated dislocation because the elastic energy integrated on the infinite volume now converges .",
    "the integration on both core cylinders leads to the same contribution @xmath34 the elastic energy of the dislocation dipole is then @xmath35    we will show in the following that the contribution @xmath36 of the core tractions only depends on the angle @xmath37 defining the azimuthal position of the dislocation dipole .",
    "it does not depend on the core radius @xmath21 nor on the separation distance @xmath38 .",
    "this contribution is not present in the elastic energy of an isolated dislocation ( eq .",
    "[ eq : eelas_dislo ] ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the introduction of an external cylinder to prevent the elastic energy from diverging .",
    "but an isolated dislocation can not exist : another defect , like a dislocation with opposite burgers vector or a surface , is always needed to close the dislocation cut and allows mechanical equilibrium . therefore , one has to use the `` trick '' of the external cylinder so as to define the elastic energy of an isolated dislocation .",
    "this gives birth to an artefact as the core traction contribution @xmath36 then disappears .",
    "we first consider that the elastic constants are isotropic . this allows to obtain simple expressions of the elastic energy which can be easily manipulated so as to illustrate the importance of the core traction contribution .",
    "we assume that the crystal is oriented in such a way that @xmath39 corresponds to the dislocation axis and @xmath40 is collinear with the edge component of the burgers vector ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "with such an orientation , the tensor @xmath24 appearing in the elastic energy of an isolated dislocation ( eq .",

( 3 - 53 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath49 as poisson s ratio is smaller than @xmath50 , this shows that the core traction contribution reduces the dislocation elastic energy when the dislocation cut corresponds to its glide plane .        to understand the importance of the core traction contribution",

    "[ fig : dipole_cycle ] .",
    "this cycle has been proposed by hirth and lothe ( ref .",

    "the variation of energy through the complete cycle is then @xmath56 .",
    "if one had neglected the core traction contribution to the dipole elastic energy , the energy variation would have been non - null which violates the law of thermodynamics .",
    "the proper consideration of all energy contributions in the volterra elastic field thus allows a coherent definition of dislocation energetics .",
    "such a coherency does not require more complex descriptions which assume a spreading of the dislocation like in the peierls - nabarro model or in the standard core model proposed by lothe @xcite .",

    "the core energy is a dislocation intrinsic property which takes into account the fact that atomic interactions can not be described by elasticity close to the dislocation core . on the other hand ,",
    "the core traction contribution is a part of the elastic energy and depends on the positions of other dislocations through the angle @xmath37 defining the dislocation cut .",
    "the application to edge dislocations in iron showed that dislocation core energies could be obtained consistently from different simulation approaches , _",
    "i.e._the cluster or the dipole approaches .",
    "both approaches lead to the same core energy when one does not forget to take into account the energy contribution of core tractions in the dipole approach .",
    "this allowed us to conclude that @xmath119 edge dislocations are more stable than @xmath120 ones .",
    "the contribution of core tractions is also important when defining the elastic energy of a dislocation loop as pointed by bullough and foreman @xcite . for a glissile loop",
    ", this contribution generally reduces the elastic energy of edge segments : this is true at least for an isotropic crystal ( eq .  [ eq : ec_iso_edge ] ) . as a consequence",
    ", this would lead to loop shapes which are more rounded than with a simple line tension model where this contribution is omitted @xcite . as this contribution does not depend on the loop size",
    ", smaller loops should be more rounded than larger ones , in agreement with experimental observations @xcite .",
    "this energy contribution could therefore explain some discrepancies obtained between a simple line tension model and , either experimental observations @xcite , or results deduced from simulations of the loop self stress @xcite .",
    "gavazza and barnett @xcite showed that part of the self - force acting on a loop is associated with the core traction contribution to the elastic energy .",
    "the obtained expression of this contribution to the elastic energy ( eq .  [ eq : energy_dislo_core ] ) could therefore be used in dislocation dynamics simulations to compute the self - force acting on a dislocation segment .    to conclude",
    ", we would like to stress that we obtained the expression of the core traction contribution to the elastic energy within the framework of the sextic formalism .",
    "anisotropic linear elasticity of line defects can also be handled within the integral formalism@xcite . in the integral method",
    ", all quantities defining the elastic fields are obtained from angular integrals , so that one does not need to look for the solutions of the sextic equations .",
    "the recasting of our result within the integral formalism stills needs to be done . but this may not be possible as the expression [ eq : energy_dislo_core ] we obtained does not make appear any known integral . getting an expression of the core traction contribution to the elastic energy within the integral formalism may be therefore a challenge .",
    "the author is grateful to v. bulatov , l. ventelon , and f. willaime for stimulating discussions , as well as to b. lemoine for his help with the atomic simulations .",
