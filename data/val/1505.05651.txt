    "coherent control of the electron spins of paramagnetic point defects makes it possible to control and manipulate other spins in the vicinity of the point defect .",
    "for instance , the proximate nuclear spins of the nv center in diamond can be polarized  @xcite , which can be a basis for quantum memories @xcite , entanglement - based metrological devices@xcite , and solid - state nuclear gyroscopes @xcite .",
    "a recent demonstration has shown that nuclear spins proximate to divacancies and related defects in 4h- and 6h - sic can be effectively polarized  @xcite , an important step towards enabling long - lived quantum - information processing in this technologically mature semiconductor material .",
    "the transfer of the point defects electron spin polarization can also lead to hyperpolarization of the host material , thereby enabling sensitivity - enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance and spintronic applications@xcite    many of these applications rely on dynamic nuclear spin polarization ( dnp ) to mediate polarization transfer from the electron spin to neighboring nuclear spins through the hyperfine interaction .",

    "<S> dynamic nuclear spin polarization ( dnp ) mediated by paramagnetic point defects in semiconductors is a key resource for both initializing nuclear quantum memories and producing nuclear hyperpolarization . </S>",
    "<S> dnp is therefore an important process in the field of quantum - information processing , sensitivity - enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance , and nuclear - spin - based spintronics . </S>",
    "<S> dnp based on optical pumping of point defects has been demonstrated by using the electron spin of nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) center in diamond , and more recently , by using divacancy and related defect spins in hexagonal silicon carbide ( sic ) . here </S>",
    "<S> , we describe a general model for these optical dnp processes that allows the effects of many microscopic processes to be integrated . </S>",
    "<S> applying this theory , we gain a deeper insight into dynamic nuclear spin polarization and the physics of diamond and sic defects . </S>",
    "<S> our results are in good agreement with experimental observations and provide a detailed and unified understanding . in particular , our findings show that the defects electron spin coherence times and excited state lifetimes are crucial factors in the entire dnp process .    </S>",
