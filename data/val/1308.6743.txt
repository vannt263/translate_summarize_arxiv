    "the standard - model extension ( sme ) seeks to provide relevant experimental guidance in addressing this issue by introducing a framework of all possible lorentz - violating terms.@xcite the quest to experimentally detect or constrain the lorentz - violating terms in the sme requires the ability to detect the impact of these terms at scales reasonable for experiment .",
    "one way to search for relativity violations is to study the effects of these couplings on macroscopic objects at low energies .",
