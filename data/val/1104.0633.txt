    "ever since the discovery of the non - centrosymmetric heavy fermion superconductor cept@xmath3si @xcite , there is widespread research activity to understand the nature of superconductivity in such unconventional superconductors .",
    "the term  non - centrosymmetric  characterizes the symmetry of a crystal lattice without inversion center . in such materials",
    "the standard classification in even - parity spin - singlet and odd - parity spin triplet superconducting phases is obsolete , because the electrons are exposed to antisymmetric spin - orbit coupling , e.g. rashba - type of coupling @xcite which arises due to electric field gradient in the crystal which has no inversion symmetry .",
    "an inherent feature is then the mixing of spin - singlet and spin - triplet cooper pairing channels which are otherwise distinguished by parity .",
    "this mixing of pairing states is expected to cause a two - component order parameter .",
    "new forms of pairing appear giving rise to unusual temperature / field dependence of the superconducting parameters . during recent years",
    "we have witnessed rapid developments on the side of experiments and synthesis of novel materials as well as in the theoretical understanding of this type of superconductors . indeed many new materials have been found , in particular , among the heavy fermions for which unconventional cooper pairing is expected .",
    "exotic mixed - state phases ( vortex matter ) have been predicted in theory and are under experimental investigations .",
    "for example in the case of cept@xmath3si where superconductivity occurs at ambient pressure , whereas , transition to such a state happens in uir @xcite , cerhsi@xmath3 @xcite and ceirsi@xmath3@xcite only under pressure . however , the study of superconductivity in non - centrosymmetric materials which do not exhibit heavy fermion features is also important since it avoids additional complication that arises due strong f - electron correlations .",
    "discovery of such materials also continues to increase , starting from binary carbides ( r@xmath4c@xmath5 with r = la or y ) @xcite , cd@xmath4re@xmath4o@xmath6@xcite , li@xmath4(pd , pt)@xmath3b @xcite , mg@xmath4al@xmath3 @xcite and the recently found baptsi@xmath3 @xcite . however , many of them ( except li@xmath4pt@xmath3b ) exhibit conventional bcs - like superconductivity due to small spin - orbit scattering .",
    "one of the common features in these compounds which show conventional superconductivity with small spin - orbit scattering is the absence of the large density of states at the fermi level .",
    "hence , it will be of interest to study a superconducting material which have conduction electrons with high density of states at the fermi level ( not from high f - electron correlations ) but has no inversion symmetry . in this work",
    "we report our investigations in one such material , namely @xmath0-bipd , that shows bulk superconductivity below 3.87 k via , resistivity , magnetization and heat capacity studies .",
    "@xmath0-bipd has no inversion symmetry in its monoclinic crystal structure ( space group p2@xmath1 ) .",
    "one of the important features of the structure is that the presence of short pd - pd bonds ( shorter than those present in pure pd metal ) .",
    "this could results in conduction electrons with large density of states at the fermi level which is suggested in an earlier study @xcite .",
    "the compound bipd undergoes polymorphic transformation from @xmath7bipd ( monoclinic , p2@xmath1 ) @xcite to @xmath8-bipd ( orthorhombic , cmc2@xmath1 ) above 210@xmath9c .",
    "we have synthesized phase pure @xmath0-bipd which has a monoclinic structure with the space group p2@xmath1 with b as its unique axis . due to its low melting point ( @xmath10650@xmath9c )",
    ", we have chosen to make the sample using a modified bridgeman technique .",
    "the sample was made by control heating the individual components ( bi , 99.999% pure and pd , 99.99% pure ) in a high purity alumina crucible with a pointed bottom which is kept in a quartz tube that is sealed under a vacuum of 10@xmath11 mbar .",
    "initially the contents were heated upto 650@xmath9c ( melting point of bipd ) in 12 hrs and then kept at 650@xmath9c for 12 hrs .",
    "thereafter it was slow cooled to 590@xmath9c with a rate of 1@xmath9c / hr and finally the furnace was switched off .",
    "we obtained high quality poly and single crystals of few mm size with mass ranging from 10 to 50 mgm .",

    "this t@xmath24 dependence of the resistivity is interpreted by the wilson s theory @xcite which takes into account the interband s - d phonon induced scattering within the debye approximation . however , the same theory predicts a linear temperature dependence for the resistivity at higher temperatures ( t@xmath25@xmath26 , where @xmath26 is the debye temperature ) which is not observed in @xmath0-bipd ( see fig .",
    "3(c ) ) . the wilson s theory neither considers the actual structure of the density of states of the electrons at the fermi level nor the effect of unharmonicity of the phonon mode .",
    "but the contribution from these effects in the case of @xmath0-bipd are small .",
    "there is yet another mechanism ( parallel resistor model ) suggested by fisk and webb @xcite and later by wisemann et al @xcite which accounts for the significant deviation of the resistivity from the linear temperature dependence at high temperatures ( 100  k@xmath27t@xmath27300  k ) .",
    "this has been seen in many other compounds where the @xmath15 value is rather high ( @xmath28100 @xmath19@xmath20 cm ) .",
    "the strong deviation from linearity and possible tendency towards saturation occur because the mean free path becomes short , of the order of few atomic spacings .",
    "when that happens , the scattering cross section will no longer be linear in the scattering perturbation .",
    "since the dominant temperature - dependent scattering mechanism is electron - phonon interaction here , the @xmath15 will no longer be proportional to the mean square atomic displacement , which is proportional to t for a harmonic potential .",
    "instead , the resistance will rise less rapidly than linearly in t and will show negative curvature ( d@xmath29@xmath15/dt@xmath29  @xmath270 ) .",
    "this behavior is also seen in our previous studies on silicides and germanides @xcite .",
    "wisemann _ et al _ @xcite describe the @xmath15(t ) of these compounds ( which is known as the parallel resistor model ) where the expression of @xmath15(t ) is given by , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the saturation resistivity which is independent of temperature and @xmath32(t ) is the ideal temperature - dependent resistivity .",
    "further , the ideal resistivity is given by the following expression , @xmath33 where @xmath21 is the residual resistivity and the second term is due to phonon - assisted electron scattering similar to the s - d scattering in transition metal compounds .",
    "@xmath26 is the debye temperature and @xmath34 is a numerical constant .",
    "eqn.(2 ) can be derived if we assume that the electron mean free path @xmath35 is replaced by @xmath36 ( @xmath37 being an average interatomic spacing ) .",
    "such an assumption is reasonable , since infinitely strong scattering can only reduce the electron mean free path to @xmath37 .",
    "chakraborty and allen @xcite have made a detailed investigation of the effect of strong electron - phonon scattering within the framework of the boltzmann transport equation .",
    "they find that the interband scattering opens up new _ nonclassical channels _ which account for the parallel resistor model .",
    "the high temperature resistivity fit ( 50  k@xmath27t@xmath27310  k ) shown in the fig .",
    "3(c ) yields a value of 164  @xmath19@xmath20  cm for @xmath31 , 0.33  @xmath19@xmath20  cm for @xmath21 , 76.3  @xmath19@xmath20  cm / k@xmath24 for c@xmath38 and 168.6  k for @xmath26 .",
    "this value to @xmath26 is close to the value obtained from the heat capacity data ( described later ) which suggests that the parallel resistor model can successfully explain the high temperature dependence of @xmath15(t ) of @xmath0-bipd .",

    "we believe that the observed diamagnetism in @xmath0-bipd is due to the large core diamagnetism of bi . in general , the observed value of the susceptibility can be written as , @xmath39 @xmath40 is the core diamagnetism , @xmath41 is the landau diamagnetism and @xmath42 is the pauli paramagnetism .",

    "a weak temperature dependence of @xmath14(t ) could arise due to two reasons .",

    "however , we believe that impurity concentration of this amount either in bi or in pd is unlikely ( given that the limit of the impurities both in bi and pd elements imposed by the manufacturer is @xmath5010 ppm ) .",
    "the second reason could be the temperature variation of the density of states at the fermi level which results in a temperature - dependent pauli spin susceptibility as seen in some of the a-15 compounds .",

    "<S> in this work , we establish the bulk superconductivity of a high quality sample of monoclinic bipd ( @xmath0-bipd , space group p2@xmath1 ) below 3.87  k by studying its electrical resistivity , magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity . </S>",
    "<S> we show that it is clean type - ii superconductor with moderate electron - phonon coupling and determine its superconducitng and normal state parameters . </S>",
    "<S> although @xmath0-bipd is a noncentrosymmetric superconductor with large electronic heat capacity ( therefore , large @xmath2 ) , the effect of spin - orbit splitting of the electronic bands at the fermi level is small . </S>",
    "<S> this makes little influence on the superconducting properties of @xmath0-bipd . </S>",
