    "classical be  stars @xcite are rapidly rotating early - type stars that exhibit balmer emission lines .",
    "it is widely agreed that these lines , which are generally double - peaked , originate in a relatively thin circumstellar disc that is in approximately keplerian rotation ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "while the precise mechanism by which the disc is formed remains controversial , it is likely to resemble a viscous decretion disc that is expelled by the action of a torque at its inner boundary @xcite .    many be  stars show cyclical variations in their double - peaked emission lines over years or decades , with the red and blue peaks alternately becoming more prominent .",
    "an explanation of this phenomenon was given by @xcite , who proposed that a low - frequency , one - armed oscillation mode @xcite occurs in the disc .",
    "this is equivalently to saying that the disc becomes eccentric and the slow precession of its elliptical shape gives rise to the cyclical changes in the observed emission lines .",
    "eccentric discs , in which fluid elements , solid particles or stars follow elliptical orbits of variable eccentricity around a central mass , have further applications in systems as diverse as planetary rings , protoplanetary systems , close binary stars and galactic nuclei .",
    "a detailed understanding of the origin of eccentricity and the rates of precession in the circumstellar discs of be  stars would therefore be of general interest .",
    "@xcite originally considered a disc that orbits in a point - mass potential and obtained a sequence of retrograde modes in which the precession of the disc is in a direction opposite to its rotation .",
    "retrograde precession is a natural consequence of the pressure forces in the disc , which cause a small departure from keplerian rotation and allow the eccentricity to propagate in a wavelike manner .",
    "the global modes found by @xcite are weighted towards the outer part of the disc and their periods become extremely long as the outer radius of the disc is increased to realistic values .    and considered the effect of the quadrupole gravitational potential associated with the rotational deformation of the star , which tends to cause a prograde precession of elliptical orbits .",
    "they showed that , when the quadrupole effect is taken into account , prograde modes can be obtained that are naturally confined in the inner part of the disc and are insensitive to the outer boundary condition .",
    "subsequent observations confirmed that the precession is indeed prograde .",
    "however , found that confined prograde modes can be obtained only when the disc is sufficiently cool , so that the quadrupole effect dominates over the tendency of pressure to produce retrograde precession and extended modes .",
    "he concluded that a different mechanism is required in the hotter discs of early - type be  stars such as the prototype @xmath0  cas , and proposed that radiative line forces could explain the required prograde precession .",
    "unfortunately the modelling of radiative forces is subject to considerable uncertainty",
    ". found that the resulting model has little predictive power owing to the sensitivity of the results to the parameters .",
    "more recently , investigated an alternative way to obtain prograde modes in hotter discs .",
    "this involves replacing the rigid inner boundary condition at the stellar surface with a free boundary condition , on the basis that a gap is formed between the star and the disc .",
    "such a gap is not generally expected in the scenario of the viscous decretion disc but might be possible in alternative models .",
    "all of the treatments described so far are based on two - dimensional models of the disc that neglect aspects of its vertical structure and motion . at first sight",
    ", such an approach seems reasonable for studying eccentric modes in thin discs , where the motion might be assumed to be purely horizontal and independent of height .",
    "however , in presenting a three - dimensional , non - linear theory of eccentric discs , we have previously argued that three - dimensional effects are of considerable importance @xcite . in particular , the variation of the vertical gravitational acceleration around an elliptical orbit excites an oscillatory vertical motion in an eccentric disc that should not be neglected .    in this paper",
    "we show that , in fact , three - dimensional effects are essential to understanding the precession of eccentric discs around be  stars .",
    "they allow confined prograde modes to be obtained even when the stellar quadrupole moment is negligible and when the inner boundary is rigid .",
    "this property allows us to give a unified description of eccentric discs of be  stars of all stellar types without introducing uncertain radiative forces or modifying the inner boundary condition . while we do not deny that in some cases radiative forces might be important , or that the inner boundary condition might differ from a rigid one ,",
    "we show that these innovations are unnecessary .",
    "most previous analyses have not discussed the processes that could cause eccentric modes to grow or decay , and which are therefore relevant to explaining the occurrence of eccentric discs around be  stars .",
    "viscous overstability @xcite provides a possible explanation ; have applied this idea to be  stars and estimated the associated growth rate .",
    "we defer to a future investigation a detailed analysis of the effects of viscous or turbulent stresses . a non - linear treatment , which could address the saturation of the growth mechanism and attempt to predict the observed amplitudes and precession rates of the eccentric modes , also remains to be undertaken .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section  [ s : basic ]",
    "we describe the basic state of the disc .",
    "we then discuss an approximate , secular theory of three - dimensional eccentric discs in section  [ s : secular ] , comparing it with the two - dimensional theories used by other authors . in section  [ s : full ] we solve the full linearized equations accurately using a spectral method , including some effects of viscosity , and compare the results with those of the secular theory .",
    "conclusions are given in section  [ s : conc ] .",
    "we consider a basic state consisting of a steady , axisymmetric disc around a rotating star .",
    "adopting cylindrical polar coordinates @xmath1 , we write the gravitational potential of the star as @xmath2,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are its mass and ( equatorial ) radius .",
    "this potential consists of monopole and quadrupole components , the latter being of dimensionless strength @xmath5 and arising from the rotational deformation of the star .",
    "( the parameter @xmath5 is related to the gravitational moment @xmath6 used in planetary science by @xmath7 . ) for a star with uniform angular velocity @xmath8 , we have @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the apsidal motion constant .",
    "we neglect higher - order multipole components as well as the self - gravitation of the disc .    in common with most other treatments , we assume that the stellar radiation maintains the disc at a constant temperature @xmath11 , slightly less than the effective temperature @xmath12 of the star .",
    "the isothermal sound speed @xmath13 is therefore constant , both in the equilibrium state and for the perturbations .",
    "we neglect any viscous or turbulent stresses and any resulting meridional motions in the disc .",
    "the basic state then has velocity @xmath14 .",

    "the surface density is @xmath33 .",

    "@xmath37 that is of interest here , @xmath36 is also the angular pattern speed of the mode in an inertial frame of reference .",
    "this can be identified with the precession rate of the eccentric disc , which is positive if the precession is prograde ( i.e.  in the same direction as the rotation of the disc ) .",
    "an approximate theory can be derived in which the disc is assumed to be nearly keplerian and the frequency @xmath36 of the wave is much less than the orbital frequency @xmath15 of the disc .",
    "this type of approximation , which is related to the secular theory of celestial mechanics , has been discussed in the two - dimensional linear case by @xcite , and @xcite , and in the three - dimensional non - linear case by @xcite .",
    "the derivation of this theory in the case of a three - dimensional isothermal disc around a be  star is presented in appendix  [ s : appendix ] , which draws on the analysis of section  [ s : full ] below .",

    "we refer to the three theories described above as ` 2ds ' , ` 2do ' and ` 3d ' ( equation  [ 3d ] ) .",
    "note , however , that the secular approximations were usually not employed in the cited papers .",
    "the 3d  secular theory is based on similar assumptions and approximations to the non - linear analysis of @xcite .",
    "in particular , some viscous or other stress is required to couple different layers in the disc so that they tend to adopt the same eccentricity . in the absence of",
    "such stresses the eccentricity may vary significantly with @xmath16 and the results can differ .",
    "this complication is discussed in section  [ s : full ] , where the full linearized equations are solved .",
    "it is consistent with the spirit of the secular approximation to neglect the differences between @xmath15 , @xmath58 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 except where essential ( i.e.  in the quantity @xmath64 ) .",
    "accordingly , we may take @xmath65 and @xmath66 . for a surface density profile @xmath67",

    "for prograde modes ( @xmath83 ) , one solution of this equation decays exponentially as @xmath84 , while the other solution grows exponentially .",

    "coupling of these motions occurs because of the variation of the vertical gravitational acceleration ( or , equivalently , the vertical frequency @xmath62 , or the scaleheight @xmath186 ) with radius .",
    "vertical hydrostatic equilibrium can not be maintained in an eccentric disc because a fluid element in an elliptical orbit experiences a vertical gravitational acceleration that oscillates with the orbital frequency .",

    "we parametrize them as @xmath225    a full treatment of the effects of viscosity is complicated , not only because the above expression for the viscous force must be evaluated in cylindrical polar coordinates and then projected on to the basis of hermite polynomials , but also because the basic state is modified to include a meridional flow driven by viscous stresses , which should be considered in the linearized equations .",
    "this problem is therefore deferred to a future investigation .    in the present paper",
    "we adopt a simpler approach in which only selected viscous effects are included .",
    "we consider what might be assumed to be the dominant viscous terms , i.e.  those involving two derivatives with respect to  @xmath16 .",
    "since @xmath226=-{\\frac}{n}{h^2}\\,{\\mathrm{he}}_n(\\zeta),\\ ] ] the inviscid perturbation equations ( [ un])([wn ] ) are modified by the addition of the viscous terms @xmath227 @xmath228 @xmath229 while equation  ( [ hn ] ) is unchanged .",
    "these terms act to damp the mode , but have most effect on components of large @xmath121 .",
    "they have no effect on @xmath230 and @xmath231 , which represent horizontal motions independent of @xmath16 .",
    "these viscous terms can also be thought of as providing a coupling between different layers of the disc and thereby encouraging it to adopt a horizontal motion independent of @xmath16 .",
    "we show below that this effect is of considerable importance .",
    "we solve the system of ordinary differential equations in @xmath212 for modes with @xmath37 using a chebyshev collocation ( i.e.  pseudospectral ) method .",
    "this approach converts the differential equations and boundary conditions into an algebraic generalized eigenvalue problem for the frequency @xmath36 , which we solve using a standard direct method .",
    "specifically , equations  ( [ un])([hn ] ) , supplemented by the viscous terms ( [ unviscous])([wnviscous ] ) , are solved for @xmath232 with @xmath218 , etc . ,",
    "set to zero for @xmath219 .",
    "rigid boundary conditions @xmath233 are adopted at both inner and outer boundaries , but it is ensured that the modes obtained are completely insensitive to the value of the outer radius and therefore to the choice of outer boundary condition .    for comparison with the results in section  [",
    "s : powerlaw ] , we consider a disc with a midplane density profile @xmath234 .",
    "we also include a shear viscosity corresponding to a constant @xmath235 parameter , but no bulk viscosity .",
    "sample results are shown in table  [ t : ot ] .",
    "the convergence of the eigenfrequency with increasing truncation order @xmath220 of the hermite polynomial basis is remarkable .",
    "the case @xmath221 corresponds exactly to the two - dimensional theory considered by @xcite , and therefore agrees well with the 2do  secular approximation . here",
    "@xmath236 is large enough to support a confined prograde mode .",
    "the precession rate is much larger in the case @xmath237 and hardly varies as further hermite polynomials are included .",
    "it agrees reasonably well with the 3d  secular theory for an inviscid disc .",
    "the slight offset of the precession frequency is attributable partly to errors in the secular approximation , which is valid only to leading order in @xmath82 , and partly to the effects of viscosity .",
    "as described in appendix  [ s : appendix ] , the viscous damping of vertical motions considered in the full model can be represented within the 3d  secular theory by multiplying the coefficient @xmath238 in the three - dimensional expression  ( [ f3d ] ) for @xmath48 by @xmath239 , where @xmath240 .",
    "table  [ t : ot ] shows that this viscous secular theory gives good agreement with the full model for @xmath241 .",

    "this damping must be overcome .",
    "viscous overstability may be able to do this , but detailed calculations are required and there is uncertainty in the applicability of a navier  stokes viscosity to turbulent stresses in the disc . a simple estimate can be made as follows . in a two - dimensional , isothermal , keplerian shearing sheet with constant kinematic shear viscosity @xmath102 and no bulk viscosity ,",
    "the maximum local growth rate of the overstability is @xmath246 and occurs for a radial wavelength @xmath247 @xcite .",
    "although our eigenfunctions do not have an obviously wavelike form , this suggests that overstability may be able to compensate for the damping rate found in table  [ t : ot ] , which corresponds to only @xmath248 for the parameters adopted there .",
    "a sufficiently large viscosity is required to couple different layers in the disc effectively . if the viscosity is reduced to @xmath249 , with other parameters as in table  [ t : ot ] , a frequency eigenvalue of @xmath250 is obtained , and a slightly larger value of @xmath220 is required to obtain the same convergence . while the precession rate agrees well with the case of @xmath241 , the damping rate is now larger than predicted by the viscous secular 3d  theory .",
    "this happens because of the increasing @xmath16-dependence of the horizontal motion in the absence of a strong coupling between layers ; although @xmath251 is still much smaller than @xmath230 for @xmath249 , the ratio @xmath252 is several times larger than in the case @xmath241 .",
    "the viscous damping of this shearing motion is more important , for @xmath249 , than that of the vertical motion considered in the viscous secular theory .",
    "if @xmath235 is reduced further , the precession rate starts to deviate from the 3d  secular theory and more vertical structure develops in the eigenfunction , requiring a larger value of @xmath220 for convergence .",
    "similar behaviour was found by @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of a three - dimensional inviscid eccentric disc could be very difficult to describe .",
    "we also note that the stresses associated with tangled magnetic fields in a disc in which the magnetorotational instability occurs may provide an elastic , or viscoelastic , coupling between different layers @xcite",
    ". the associated damping rate may be smaller than that estimated on the basis of a navier  stokes viscosity .",
    "in this paper we have examined the linear dynamics of one - armed oscillation modes in the circumstellar discs of be  stars .",
    "a three - dimensional effect , first identified by @xcite but neglected in previous treatments of be  stars , makes a crucial positive contribution to the precession rates of such modes .",
    "it allows confined prograde modes to be obtained for all reasonable disc temperatures and stellar rotation rates .",
    "this property allows us to give a unified description of eccentric discs of be  stars of all stellar types without introducing uncertain radiative forces or modifying the inner boundary condition . while we do not deny that in some cases radiative forces might be important , or that the inner boundary condition might differ from a rigid one , we have shown that these innovations are unnecessary .",
    "we obtained these results using a secular theory of eccentric discs and confirmed them using a spectral treatment of the full linearized equations for three - dimensional isothermal discs including viscous terms that couple the horizontal motions at different altitudes . in order to make these modes grow , viscous damping",
    "must be overcome by an excitation mechanism such as viscous overstability , which will be investigated in a subsequent paper .",
    "the three - dimensional dynamics that we have described may also have important consequences for the behaviour of eccentric discs in other circumstances .",
    "for example , in cataclysmic variable stars exhibiting superhumps , the relation between the precession rate of the disc and the binary mass ratio is an important observational property that is not fully explained by current theoretical models @xcite .",
    "the physical model adopted in this paper is idealized .",
    "to explain in detail the observed cyclical behaviour of the emission lines of be  stars within this theoretical framework is likely to require a treatment of non - isothermal and non - linear effects as well as a better understanding of the time - dependent behaviour of the density distribution of the circumstellar disc .",
    "in addition , future work should attempt to identify and assess mechanisms , such as viscous overstability , by which one - armed oscillation modes may be excited in circumstellar discs .",
    "nevertheless , the effect investigated in this paper enhances the credibility of the one - armed oscillation model by providing a natural explanation of confined prograde modes .",
    "i thank atsuo okazaki , john papaloizou and an anonymous referee for useful comments .",
    "we consider equations  ( [ un])([hn ] ) together with the viscous effects described in section  [ s : viscous ] .",
    "when @xmath253 and @xmath254 are eliminated , we have @xmath255 , \\label{unelim}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath256 where @xmath257 and @xmath258 are the doppler - shifted wave frequency modified to allow for the viscous damping of horizontal and vertical motions , respectively .",
    "we are interested in the case @xmath37 .",
    "this system of equations is not closed because the @xmath230 equation refers to @xmath259 , which depends on @xmath251 . in turn",
    ", the @xmath251 equation refers to @xmath260 , which depends on @xmath261 , and so on .",
    "however , suppose for the time being that @xmath251 can be neglected in the @xmath259 equation ( i.e.  equation  [ hnelim ] with @xmath184 ) .",
    "then we have a closed system @xmath262 @xmath263 @xmath264 these equations agree with a two - dimensional theory except for the additional @xmath259 term in equation  ( [ closed1 ] ) , which can be related to @xmath230 through the approximate equation  ( [ closed3 ] ) .    in the secular approximation",
    "we neglect the differences between @xmath15 , @xmath58 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 except where essential , so that @xmath265 and @xmath66 , and we assume a low frequency @xmath266 .",
    "the leading approximations to the above equations in the inviscid case are then @xmath267 @xmath268 @xmath269 these combine to give equation  ( [ secular ] ) for @xmath270 , with the three - dimensional expression  ( [ f3d ] ) for @xmath48 . if @xmath259 is neglected altogether , equation  ( [ secular ] ) is obtained , but with the two - dimensional expression  ( [ f2d ] ) for @xmath48 .",
    "it can be seen from the above equations that @xmath259 always makes a positive contribution to the precession rate @xmath36 .",
    "neglecting @xmath251 compared to @xmath230 is equivalent to assuming that the eccentricity is independent of @xmath16 , since @xmath204 and @xmath206 . under what conditions",
    "is this assumption reasonable ?",
    "rough estimates based on equations  ( [ unelim ] ) and  ( [ hnelim ] ) show that @xmath251 can be neglected in the @xmath259 equation if @xmath271 is much larger than the precession frequencies @xmath36 or @xmath48 , meaning that the shear viscosity prevents the significant development of a @xmath16-dependent horizontal motion .",
    "this condition is readily satisfied in the circumstellar discs of be  stars for reasonable values of @xmath235 .",
    "ultimately , however , the validation of this approximation comes from the numerical solution of the full system of linearized equations .    if viscosity is retained in this analysis , within the secular approximation , then the coefficient of @xmath259 in equation  ( [ h2 ] ) is multiplied by @xmath272 , where @xmath240 . in this case ,",
    "equation  ( [ secular ] ) is again obtained , but in expression  ( [ f3d ] ) for @xmath48 the coefficient @xmath238 of the three - dimensional term is multiplied by @xmath239 . in this case",
    "the mode decays because of the viscous damping of the vertical motion .",
    "for sufficiently small @xmath235 , however , the decay rate is enhanced by the viscous damping of the @xmath16-dependent horizontal motion .",
