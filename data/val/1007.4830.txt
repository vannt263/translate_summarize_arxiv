    ", regulatory rnas ( termed `` regrnas '' in this paper ) have emerged as key regulators in virtually all the cellular processes studied to date .",

    "such pairs of target and regulatory rna transcripts are found to be co  regulated , co  expressed or inversely expressed more frequently than expected by chance , presumably due to sharing of common transcription factors @xcite . in particular , some transcription factors have been found to bind to overlapping transcript pairs , thus potentially coupling the regulation of a coding gene and its regulatory rna @xcite .",

    "hence , the protein levels showed very uniform patterns with only small deviations around the deterministic steady state .",
    "the protein levels were also characterized by a very small coefficient of variation .",
    "the latter is in agreement with the experimental evidence that when the contribution of external factor affecting cell  to  cell variability is substracted , noise in protein expression is dominated by the stochastic production and destruction of mrnas @xcite .",
    "we stress that both networks were simulated with the same algorithm , kinetic parameters , and initial conditions .    an additional difference between both models",
    "was given by the average of the stochastic simulations .",

    "the fact that the divergence appeared at low transcription rates , and that it was absent in the reduced model , hints at the mrna stochastic dynamics as the source of this divergence .",

    "such deviations are commonly expected in non  linear systems and/or systems containing a small number of molecules , although more generic systems can also present large deviations @xcite .      to achieve a given protein concentration an organism can adopt diverse strategies characterized by different transcription and translation rates .",
    "one strategy consists of producing a few mrna transcripts and translating them efficiently .",
    "alternatively , the organism can transcribe a larger number of transcripts and translate each one of them inefficiently .",
    "the former strategy is energetically favorable since a lower number of transcripts has to be produced ; however it was suggested that it may lead to a noisier pattern of protein expression @xcite .    in order to determine the influence of these two strategies on noise , we ran simulations for different transcription and translation rates in the base model .",

    "our results show a general agreement with the previous observation ; at a fixed transcription rate , the noise increases with the expression level . however",
    ", our results also show that noise fundamentally depends on the interplay between the transcription and translation rates .",
    "for instance , along the lines of constant protein levels the coefficient of variation reaches a maximum at low transcription and high translation rates .",
    "this suggests that the variability in protein expression depends not only on the average expression level , but also on the ratio of transcription versus translation efficiency .",
    "additional factors such as non  linear regulatory loops ( as in our model system ) may also lead to deviations from the scaling rule .",

    "while none of the systems was correctly described by the deterministic solution , the departure from the deterministic dynamics was smaller in the model with regrna .",
    "this suggests that , in the presence of a regulatory rna molecule , the individual cell s dynamics is more robust to transcript fluctuations , hence leading to a reduced cell  to  cell variability .    to verify that the reduced excitability in the extended model is due to the action of the regrna , we tested the dynamics of the extended model at different regrna transcription rates and compared it with the base model dynamics . if our hypothesis is correct , the two systems should show differences in their excitatory dynamics as the amount of regrna increases .",

    "the coefficient of variation was maximized at low sense transcription rate , in agreement with the qualitative behavior of the base model .",
    "however , at high regrna copy number ( above @xmath41 transcripts ) , the coefficient of variation became independent of the sense transcription rate .",

    "[ fig : buffering](c ) , reveals a completely different dynamics .",

    "we conclude that the regrna is able to filter out some of the stochastic fluctuations and induce a smoother protein expression pattern .",
    "such noise dampening capacity was predicted before in a circuit in which a shared transcription factor regulates a pair of sense and a highly expressed antisense transcript @xcite .",

    "was reached as a trade  off between having fast binding and unbinding dynamics , and having the highest number of regrna molecules ( magenta line ) .",

    "we have analyzed the response of three different network architectures of a feedback loop and we have observed remarkable differences among them that emerge from the rna dynamical description .",
    "the fluctuations inherited from the transcription process can be amplified during translation and produce pulses of protein expression .",

    "if this process is repeated sufficient times during a typical mrna half  life , then the memory of previous states inherited from the transcription process can be erased and , therefore , noise can be partially buffered . in this way , regrna contributes to reduce the temporal variability at the single  cell level and , consequently , also the cell  to  cell variability . a requisite for this mechanism to work efficiently is fast binding and unbinding ( compared to the typical rna life ",
    "time ) between the regulatory rna and its target mrna , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : buffering ] . as a result of this buffering ,",
    "the extended model is less excitable .",
    "the circuit still shows pulses , yet compared to the base model where there is no regrna , the pulses are broader and with smaller amplitude , and they appear at a lower frequency .",
    "a prime example of an oscillating negative feedback loop is provided by the p53mdm2 regulatory network .",
    "this system has been shown to oscillate at the single and cell population levels ( sustained oscillations versus damped oscillations respectively ) @xcite .",
    "the maintenance and shape of the oscillations have been linked to two upstream signaling kinases as well as to an additional negative feedback loop @xcite .",
    "interestingly however , a single nucleotide polymorphism ( snp309 ) found in the mdm2 promoter that results in higher levels of mdm2 mrna and protein @xcite has been shown to disrupt the oscillations of p53 and mdm2 protein @xcite .",
    "this finding supports the idea that rnas could play an important role in the oscillatory dynamics in this network , as a high number of mdm2 mrnas would minimize the importance of the intrinsic stochastic fluctuations , and thus attenuate the pulses of protein expression .    while this work has considered a negative feedback loop , the mechanism that we have described is more general and apply to a wide variety of regulatory networks .",
    "we have shown that the rna dynamics is a fundamental source of intrinsic noise , suggesting that a realistic description of genetic networks requires the stochastic modeling of the transcription stages of protein expression .",
