    "the characterization of density fluctuations in many - body systems is a problem of great interest in the physical , mathematical and biological sciences .",
    "a _ hyperuniform _",
    "many - particle system is one in which density fluctuations are anomalously suppressed at long - wavelengths , compared to those occurring in the poisson point process and typical correlated disordered point processes .",
    "the hyperuniformity concept provides a new way to classify crystals , certain quasiperiodic systems , and special disordered systems @xcite .",
    "a theory for understanding hyperuniformity in terms of the number variance of point processes has been developed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the theory characterizes hyperuniform point process in @xmath0-dimensions with the property that the variance in the number of points in an observation window of radius @xmath1 grows at a rate slower than @xmath2 , which is the growth rate for a poisson point process .",
    "it is known that some determinantal point processes are disordered and hyperuniform @xcite .",
    "_ weyl - heisenberg ensembles _ are a very general class of determinantal point processes on @xmath3 , with @xmath4 an even number .",
    "they are defined in terms of the schrdinger representation of the heisenberg group acting on a vector @xmath5 . for choices of @xmath6 in the hermite function basis of @xmath7 ,",
    "they reduce to extensions of the two - dimensional one - component plasma and the ginibre ensemble to higher landau levels . in this paper",
    ", we will show that weyl - heisenberg ensembles are hyperuniform .",
    "actually , a bit more is true : the variance of the number of points in an observation window of radius @xmath1 grows at a rate proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "this was already known to happen in the two - dimensional one - component plasma .",
    "our results about the weyl - heisenberg ensembles show that the same happens with the distribution of electrons when higher landau levels are formed under strong magnetic fields .",
    "higher landau levels lead to the macroscopic effect known as the quantum - hall effect @xcite .",
    "there are several ways of randomly distributing points on the euclidean space . under mild assumptions ,",
    "a point process is completely specified by the countably infinite set of generic @xmath9-particle probability density functions , denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "these are proportional to the probability density of finding @xmath9 particles in volume elements around the given positions @xmath11 , irrespective of the remaining particles .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath12 is a simple process defined on the euclidean space - so that points do not have multiplicities , then @xmath13 is characterized by the properties that ( i ) @xmath14 , whenever the positions of two of the points @xmath15 are equal , and ( ii ) for every family of disjoint measurable sets @xmath16 , @xmath17 = \\int_{\\prod_j d_j } \\rho_{k}(\\mathbf{r}_{1}, ... ,\\mathbf{r}_{k } ) d\\mathbf{r}_{1 } \\ldots d\\mathbf{r}_{k},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 denotes the number of points to be found in @xmath19 .",
    "for instance , poisson processes distribute points randomly but in a completely uncorrelated way .",
    "indeed , in this case , the @xmath9-particle probability density reduces to constants easy to compute . since the single - particle density function can be obtained from the thermodynamical limit @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the strength of the magnetic field and grows together with the number of points @xmath22 : @xmath23 the @xmath9-particle probability densities for poisson processes are given by @xmath24 however , in several many - body systems and other physical models , one has to take into account particle - particle interactions , requiring more sophisticated probabilistic models . in studies of the statistical mechanics of point - like particles one is usually interested in a handful of quantities such as @xmath9-particle correlations .",
    "it is then of paramount importance to study point processes for which the properties of such correlations have convenient analytic descriptions as , for instance , in the so - called ghost random sequential addition processes @xcite .",
    "but such exactly solvable models are not so common , leading to widespread use of poisson processes instead of more sophisticated probability models , because simple analytic expressions for the @xmath9-particle correlations are available .",
    "facing such a gap between the physical model and its mathematical description , one may be led to think that the possibility of using probabilistic models describing interacting particles , with @xmath9-particle correlations written in analytic form , is a hopeless mathematical chimera . however , using determinantal point processes , it is possible to construct such probabilistic models .",
    "determinantal point processes ( dpp s ) are defined in terms of a kernel where the negative correlation between points is built in . because of the repulsion inherent of the model , they are convenient to describe physical systems with charged - liked particles , where the confinement to a bounded region is controlled by a weight function involving the external field .",
    "unlike other non - trivial statistical models , the @xmath9-particle correlations of dpp s admit an analytic expression as determinants whose entries are defined using the correlation kernel . moreover , dpp s enjoy a remarkable property which allows one to derive the macroscopic laws of physical systems constituted by interacting particles which display chaotic random behavior at small scales : for very large systems of points confined to bounded regions , the distribution patterns begin to look less chaotic and start to organize themselves in an almost uniform way .",
    "in several cases , in the proper scaled thermodynamical limit , the distributions are either uniform or given by analytic expressions .",
    "this phenomenon is related to a property of physical and mathematical systems known as _ universality _",
    "@xcite .",
    "the present paper explores a link between the theory of dpp s and the schrdinger representation of the heisenberg group .",
    "this link is important because it allows one to deal with problems involving non - analytic functions of complex variables using real - variable methods .",
    "it has also been used in @xcite to obtain analytic and probabilistic results for a large class of planar ensembles , building on previous work on time - frequency analysis and approximation theory @xcite .",
    "while the papers @xcite are concerned with universality - type limit distribution laws and with probabilistic aspects of finite - dimensional weyl - heisenberg ensembles , in this paper we will focus on _ infinite weyl - heisenberg ensembles_.    the article is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec_dpp ] introduces planar dpp s and our model process , the ginibre ensemble .",
    "the notion of hyperuniformity is introduced in section [ sec_hy ] .",
    "section [ sec_poly ] presents higher landau levels and the polyanalytic ensembles , that describe them mathematically .",
    "section [ sec_wh ] presents weyl - heisenberg ensembles and the main results on hyperuniformity , which are then applied to the polyanalytic ensemble and higher landau levels .",
    "we also discuss and analyze the total correlation function and the structure factor associated with these point processes , and provide explicit formulae whenever possible .",
    "finally section [ sec_con ] summarizes the results .",
    "determinantal point processes are defined using an ambient space @xmath25 and a radon measure @xmath26 defined on @xmath25 @xcite . in our case , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is an even number , and",
    "we use the identification @xmath29 , since several of the examples of interest are best described in terms of complex variables . for this reason , we sometimes denote points in @xmath29 by @xmath30 , instead of the usual @xmath31 . the important object is the hilbert space @xmath32 , with the lebesgue measure in @xmath33 . if @xmath34 is an orthogonal sequence of @xmath35 , one can define a reproducing kernel @xmath36 by writing @xmath37 the kernel @xmath36 will be the correlation kernel of the point process @xmath12 , whose @xmath9-point intensities are given by @xmath38 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath39 , selecting @xmath40 for @xmath41 in ( [ kernel ] ) , we obtain @xmath42 which is the correlation kernel of the _ ginibre ensemble _ of dimension @xmath22 .",
    "if we take @xmath43 , we obtain the correlation kernel of the infinite ginibre ensemble : @xmath44 the infinite ginibre ensemble is _ translationally invariant _ ; this means that the intensity functions satisfy : @xmath45 , for all @xmath46 .",
    "it is well known that the ginibre ensemble is equivalent to a model for the probability distribution of electrons in one component plasmas @xcite .",
    "it also provides a model for the statistical quantum dynamics of a charged particle evolving in a euclidean space under the action of a constant homogeneous magnetic field in the first landau level .",
    "the ginibre ensemble can also be seen as a 2d electrostatic model with @xmath22 unit charges interacting in a two dimensional space , which is taken as the complex plane of the variable @xmath30 . indeed ,",
    "if the potential energy of the system is given as @xmath47 the corresponding probability distribution of the positions @xmath48 when the charges are in thermodynamical equilibrium , is proportional to the measure @xmath49 = \\exp \\left [ -\\pi \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\\left\\vert z_{k}\\right\\vert ^{2}\\right ] \\prod_{0\\leq i < j\\leq n-1}\\left\\vert z_{i}-z_{j}\\right\\vert ^{2}.   \\label{vandermond}\\ ] ] it has been shown by jean ginibre @xcite that the distribution associated with the measure ( [ vandermond ] ) is proportional to the one obtained from the @xmath22-point intensities associated with the ginibre ensemble of dimension @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the ginibre ensemble provides a model for the distribution of charged - like particles in the first landau level . until recently",
    ", there was no similar ginibre type model for higher landau levels , but this gap in the statistical physics literature is being filled thanks to recent work concerning the _ polyanalytic ginibre ensembles _ @xcite - see also section [ sec_poly ] .",

    ", it can be obtained from the @xmath52-point intensity @xmath20 , which is simply defined as the diagonal of the correlation kernel of the process : @xmath53 the expected number of points @xmath18 to be found in @xmath54 is then given as @xmath55 = \\int_{d}\\rho ( \\mathrm{r})d\\mathrm{r}.\\ ] ] the @xmath52-point intensity @xmath20 is also called the single particle probability density .      in @xcite , it has been discovered that a hyperuniform many - particle system modeled by a point process @xmath12 in a euclidean space of dimension @xmath0  ( not necessarily determinantal ) is one in which the number variance @xmath56 -\\mathbb{e } \\left [ \\mathcal{x}(d_{r})\\right ] ^{2},\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is a @xmath0-dimensional ball of radius @xmath1 , satisfies @xmath58      we will be mostly interested in a translationally invariant point process of intensity 1 , i.e. , the intensity functions satisfy @xmath59 , for all @xmath60 , and @xmath61 . for such processes ,",

    "<S> weyl - heisenberg ensembles include as a special case a multi - layer extension of the ginibre ensemble modeling the distribution of electrons in higher landau levels , which has recently been object of study in the realm of the ginibre - type ensembles associated with polyanalytic functions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the family of weyl - heisenberg ensembles includes new structurally anisotropic processes , where point - statistics depend on the different spatial directions , and thus provide a first means to study directional hyperuniformity . </S>"
