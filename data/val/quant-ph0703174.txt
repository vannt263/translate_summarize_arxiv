    "in recent years there has been a lively discussion about the thermodynamic consistency of the expression for the casimir pressure at finite temperature @xmath4 .",
    "the problem gets accentuated at low values of @xmath4 , where one has to satisfy the nernst theorem saying that @xmath5 goes to zero as @xmath6 .",
    "( here @xmath7 is the entropy and @xmath8 the free energy , both referring to unit plate area . )",
    "what we shall consider in the following is the standard casimir configuration , implying two semi - infinite homogeneous metallic media separated by a vacuum gap of width @xmath9 .",
    "we take the two media to be identical , and assume that they are nonmagnetic with a frequency dependent relative permittivity @xmath10 .",
    "spatial dispersion is neglected .",
    "the two surfaces lying at @xmath11 and @xmath12 are assumed to be perfectly plane , and to be of infinite extent .",
    "a central ingredient in the discussion of the thermodynamic consistency of calculated results for the casimir attractive force between real materials is the form of dispersion relation used as input in the conventional lifshitz formula .",
    "a very useful dispersion relation - the one that in our opinion is by far the most preferable one amongst simple dispersion relations for real systems at arbitrary frequencies - is the drude expression @xmath13 here @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the plasma frequency , and @xmath16 is the relaxation frequency ( we use the same notation as in ref .",
    "the plasma wavelength is @xmath17 . for gold ,",
    "the substance that we shall focus on in the following , we use @xmath18 in ref .",
    "@xcite , we employed the values @xmath19 ev , @xmath20 mev , what amounts roughly to a difference on the 1% level .",
    "the exact determination of drude parameters is a non - trivial matter as discussed in @xcite .",
    "using a slightly different set of drude parameters will shift our numerical results slightly , but does not alter any of our conclusions .",
    "when comparing with experimental values it turns out that the drude relation fits optical data very accurately for @xmath21 rad / s @xcite . in this connection",
    "we should bear in mind the following fact ( cf . also the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) : there exist no measurements of the permittivity at very low frequencies . what is available , is a series of measurements of the imaginary part @xmath22 of the complex permittivity @xmath23 .",
    "the kramers - kronig relations then permit us to calculate the real part @xmath24 , and thus the complete @xmath10 is known .",
    "permittivity data kindly supplied by astrid lambrecht cover a very large frequency region , from @xmath25 rad / s to @xmath26 rad / s . from these data ,",
    "the relaxation frequency @xmath16 can be derived .",
    "as mentioned , from comparison with experimental data it turns out that @xmath16 can be taken to be constant to a good accuracy , up to about @xmath27 rad / s . for low frequencies the drude relation yields the proper extrapolation down to @xmath28 .",
    "a word of caution is called for , as regards the circumstance that permittivity measurements are done at _ room temperature _ in practice .",
    "the frequency @xmath16 is in principle temperature dependent , and we do not know the value of @xmath29 very accurately .",
    "it might seem natural here to invoke the bloch - grneisen formula for the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity ( cf .",

    "there are always impurities present , which make the value of @xmath16 finite at @xmath0 @xcite . the bloch - grneisen formula , thus ,",

    "strictly , the drude parameters of eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) are valid at room - temperature , and @xmath16 will take significantly smaller values for low temperatures .",
    "this affects our numerical results quantitatively , but not qualitatively ; as long as @xmath16 is nonzero , the te part of the free energy vanishes at zero frequency which is the central point .",
    "the recent series of works on the casimir effect by the present group of authors @xcite - built upon the lifshitz formula and the measured values of @xmath10 in combination with the drude relation - have nowhere been found to run into conflict with basic thermodynamic principles .",
    "and there are other papers in agreement with ours : for instance , jancovici and amaj @xcite , and buenzli and martin @xcite considered the casimir force between two plates in the high - temperature limit .",
    "they found that the linear dependence in @xmath4 for the casimir force to be reduced by a factor of two from the behavior of of an _ ideal _ metal , this being a signal of the vanishing influence from the zero - frequency te mode .",
    "( the first observation of the vanishing influence from this particular mode was made by bostrm and sernelius @xcite . )",
    "further support is found in the paper of sernelius @xcite , who calculates the casimir force taking spatial dispersion into account as well .",
    "it is found that at high temperatures and/or at large separations the force is reduced by the same factor of two compared with the ideal - metal result .",
    "there is no universal agreement on these issues , however . in a series of recent papers - cf .",
    ", for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite - it is argued that the drude dispersion relation runs into trouble explaining recent experiments , and moreover comes into conflict with the nernst theorem .",

    "an argument of the latter references is that omission of a zero frequency te - mode would add a term linear in @xmath4 to the free energy .",
    "this would violate the nernst theorem as it would give a non - zero contribution to the entropy at @xmath0 . however , this argument is based upon use of the i m ( idealized metal ) model where @xmath34 for all @xmath35 , or use of the plasma model ( [ 4 ] ) where no relaxation is present . with @xmath36 the term in question",

    "this was not verified in utmost detail , however ; the numerical results of ref .",
    "@xcite did not go sufficiently close to @xmath0 to show the behavior very distinctly , and the previous discussion and disagreement about violation of the nernst theorem has accordingly continued . the main purpose of the present work is to investigate the issue more closely : we will show in detail , both analytically and numerically , how the casimir energy behaves close to @xmath0 and by that show how it is consistent with the nernst theorem .",
    "we shall not go into a study of experimental aspects in this paper .",
    "rather , the objections referred to above makes it mandatory to reconsider the thermodynamics associated with the drude relation anew , which brings us to the central theme of this paper .",
    "we will aim at showing , via a combination of analytical and numerical methods , how the basic theory sketched above ( essentially the drude theory ) satisfies the nernst theorem to a very high accuracy .",
    "we consider this point to be important ; a simple physical model of course can not be permitted to run into conflict with thermodynamics .    in the next section",
    "we show analytically , by using the euler - maclaurin formula , that the dominant contribution to the free casimir energy @xmath8 near @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "we evaluate both this term and the leading correction term , which is proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "this implies that the entropy @xmath5 tends to zero as @xmath6 , in accordance with the nernst theorem . in sect .",
    "3 we calculate @xmath8 numerically , and find agreement with the previous analytical result to a very high degree of accuracy . the results are illustrated in various figures .",
