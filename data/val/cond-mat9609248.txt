    "et al._@xcite have shown that the inclusion of higher - order d - wave gradients in the gl free energy can give rise to a fourfold - symmetric current distribution around a vortex even in the absence of an induced s - wave component .",
    "one of the objectives of the present work is the clarification of this issue .",
    "indeed , we find that the contributions to anisotropy of a fourth - order gradient term and the s - wave component are comparable , and tend to compete .    while phenomenological gl theory has been highly successful in predicting many interesting properties of d - wave superconductors in external fields , the relative magnitudes of the various coefficients appearing in the free energy and their dependence on temperature , filling , and field are presently unknown .",

    "high transition temperatures are obtained in the model due to the presence of a van hove singularity in the hole density of states near the fermi energy .",
    "an extended , flat band near @xmath9 in momentum space is consistent with numerical investigations of a single hole propagating through an antiferromagnetic background@xcite , and with experimental evidence.@xcite in the avh model , holes are constrained to move within a single sublattice of a uniform antiferromagnetic background in order to minimize frustration .",
    "the hopping parameters are chosen to best fit the quasiparticle dispersion for ybco measured using arpes.@xcite    in section ii , the ginzburg - landau equations for the gap functions and supercurrent are derived microscopically for both the eh and avh lattice models using a finite - temperature green function method .",
    "the relations defining the transition temperatures are investigated in section iii .",
    "it is found that only a d - wave transition is favoured for the avh model ; the d - wave transition temperature @xmath10 k is consistent with the high - temperature ( high-@xmath8 ) oxides .",

    "<S> the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) equations for a @xmath0 superconductor are derived within the context of two microscopic lattice models used to describe the cuprates : the extended hubbard model and the antiferromagnetic - van hove model . </S>",
    "<S> both models have pairing on nearest - neighbour links , consistent with theories for d - wave superconductivity mediated by spin fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> analytical results obtained for the extended hubbard model at low electron densities and weak - coupling are compared to results reported previously for a d - wave superconductor in the continuum . </S>",
    "<S> the variation of the coefficients in the gl equations with carrier density , temperature , and coupling constants are calculated numerically for both models . the relative importance of anisotropic higher - order terms in the gl free energy is investigated , and the implications for experimental observations of the vortex lattice are considered . </S>"
