    "a liquid metallic hydrogen represents one of possible realizations of two - component superconductor medium where the existence of non - abrikosov vortices and their characteristics can be verified in experiment .",
    "another attractive feature of the lmh is that it could be an alternative candidate for the high temperature superconductor with coexistence phase of electron - electron and proton - proton cooper pairs@xcite .",
    "such a multi - component superconductor dresses novel features that do not appear in the normal superconductor .    in the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory of superconductivity , the gl parameter @xmath0 defined as a ratio of the penetration length @xmath1 to the coherence length @xmath2 divides the superconductor into two classes , type - i and type - ii superconductor with the parameter values @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "since the two - component superconductor has two independent gl parameters , @xmath5 , a new type of superconductivity appears in the regime @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( assuming @xmath8 ) which is coined as a type-1.5 superconductivity @xcite .",
    "another interesting issue is that there are different types of topologically stable non - abrikosov vortex solutions in lmh . except the d - type and n - type vortices discussed in @xcite ,",
    "a new gp - type vortex has been found in lmh .",
    "a main purpose of the present paper is to study these new vortex solutions and their properties in lmh .",
    "it has been shown that type - ii and type-1.5 superconductivity may exist in lmh@xcite , and for each type of superconductivity there are three types of non - abrikosov vortex solutions .",
    "we consider the following properties of the vortices related to the presence of the fractional magnetic flux , non - vanishing condensate at the core of the vortex , magnetic flux inversion and a neutral vortex .",
    "an extended gl theory has been studied in @xcite which has advantages in studying of electronic , magnetic , calorimetric , and other properties of twoband superconductors . and the gl theory for multiband superconductors from multiband bcs hamiltonian",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the two - component ginzburg - landau theory for lmh . in section 3",
    "we present numerical vortex solutions of lmh with two condensates having only one effective complex phase factor . the d - type and n - type vortices with unusual properties",
    "are described as well .",
    "section 4 deals with the case of both condensates with non - zero complex phases .",
    "we demonstrate that there exist three types of vortex solutions , d - type , n - type and gp - type vortices , determined by different boundary conditions at the core .",
    "we have found a neutral vortex in lmh which has no magnetic field .",
    "conclusions and discussions are given in the last section .",
    "let us start with a free energy of lmh described by two - component ginzburg - landau model@xcite    @xmath9    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are two complex fields corresponding to the order parameters of electron and proton condensates , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are absolute values of the cooper pair s charge , @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the masses of electronic and protonic cooper pairs , respectively .    in lmh the both , electron and proton ,",
    "condensates are conserved independently since the electronic cooper pairs can not convert to protonic cooper pairs .",
    "therefore , there is no intrinsic josephson interband interaction@xmath16 in lmh@xcite .",
    "moreover , there is no interband interaction @xmath17 in two - gap metallic superconductors@xcite . in this weak - coupling approximation",
    "the effective potential for lmh can be expressed as follows @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the quartic coupling constants and @xmath20 are chemical potentials .",
