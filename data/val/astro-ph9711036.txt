    "gravitational interactions between galaxies are believed to play a major role in determining galaxy physical properties ( spitzer & baade 1951 ; toomre & toomre 1972 ; toomre 1974 ; schweizer 1996 ; schweizer & seitzer 1992 ; cole 1994 ) .",
    "for example , galactic interactions are likely to enhance star formation rates and could explain the intense star formation seen in iras galaxies . indeed , these highly luminous infrared galaxies often show evidence of undergoing tidal interactions or mergers ( clements 1996 ; leech 1994 ) .    on theoretical grounds , models have shown that close encounters of galaxies stimulate cloud growth and star formation .",
    "stellar and mass distributions in galaxies are likely to be altered by tidal collisions , and , as a result , the morphology of a galaxy may evolve .",
    "for example , the disks of spiral galaxies might be puffed up by such tidal encounters , and it has been suggested ( richstone 1976 ) that spiral galaxies might be converted into s0 or elliptical galaxies by such a mechanism .",
    "following this idea , galaxy morphologies might be largely determined by the local properties of the environment in which they form and evolve , since tidal collisions between galaxies occur more frequently in denser regions of the universe .",
    "alternatively , galaxy morphologies may be related to intrinsic properties of the primordial fluctuation field . in the cold dark matter ( cdm )",
    "theory in which the density parameter @xmath0 , a bias must be invoked whereby the overdense regions contain galaxies , and the underdense regions ( voids ) are deficient in luminous galaxies , so that the luminous matter has stronger density correlations than the underlying dark matter .",
    "early discussions of cdm used gaussian fluctuations as described by the peaks formalism ( bardeen 1986 ) and introduced a bias of the galaxy types with respect to mass by identifying 3@xmath3 primordial fluctuations with protoelliptical galaxies and @xmath4 fluctuations with protospirals in order to match the observed frequency and clustering of luminous galaxies ( blumenthal 1984 ; evrard 1989 ; evrard , silk & szalay 1990 ) .",
    "though this approach offered the advantage of reproducing several observed correlations , no physical mechanism was proposed to explain this intrinsic biasing until dekel & silk ( 1986 ) argued that 1@xmath3 fluctuations that satisfy the cooling criterion for galaxy formation ( rees & ostriker 1977 ; silk 1977 ) would be systematically of low - mass and shallow gravitational potential wells so that the rms density fluctuations should be especially vulnerable to disruption by supernovae explosions .",
    "a prediction of this model is that an extensive distribution of failed galaxies , identified as dwarf elliptical galaxies , would populate the low - density regions of the universe .",
    "however , it has been argued that observations strongly constrain the hypothesis that dwarf ellipticals can account for biasing ( bingelli 1989 ) , the more luminous , observed dwarf ellipticals clustering together with the bright galaxies .",
    "an alternative physical bias mechanism may naturally involve galaxy interactions as far as these interactions are assumed to trigger star formation . according to this approach",
    ", low - density regions of the universe should contain nascent or unborn galaxies , essentially gas clouds , since collisions are much less frequent in underdense regions .",
    "conversely , in denser regions , substantial interactions at the epoch of formation would induce early star formation and subsequent collisions may redistribute the galactic stellar content and alter the galaxy morphology .    in this paper",
    ", we build a simple semi - analytical model of galaxy interactions to understand galaxy morphologies and how they relate to the properties of the environment and the fluctuation field at the epoch of formation .",
    "we shall show that simple collision rules provide an explanation of the morphological distribution of galaxies with respect to environment , as well as of fundamental correlations in their structural properties .",
    "moreover , biasing of galaxies of different morphological types with respect to mass originates naturally in our scenario .",
    "the model is based on the results of n - body simulations of tidal collisions ( aguilar & white 1985 ; ag85 hereafter ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we first describe our model .",
    "galaxy collisions are characterized in terms of the rate of change of binding energy induced in a given galaxy , at a given epoch , by tidal encounters with a set of background galaxies (  2 ) .",
    "the cases for field and cluster galaxies are treated separately as the physics of collisions is quite different in these two environments . in  3 , the total change of binding energy in a galaxy that went through a series of tidal collisions since its formation ( we shall refer to this quantity as the collision factor ) is computed and characterizes the collision history of the galaxy .",
    "scalings of the collision factor with local galaxy density are obtained . in  4 , we propose a phenomenological definition of galaxy morphological types that can be easily expressed as conditions on the collision factor (  4.2 ) .",
    "we show (  4.3 ) that these conditions are in turn conditions on the formation redshift of galaxies , and we define redshift cuts , in the space of formation redshifts , that delineate spiral , s0 and elliptical galaxies .",
    "sections 5 and 6 are devoted to normalizing our model to various sets of observations , assuming cdm initial conditions .",
    "predictions of the model are given in the remaining sections .",
    "the model predicts the redshift of formation (  7 ) as well as the relative bias between galaxies of various morphological types (  8 ) in the field .",
    "the morphology - density relation is well reproduced by the model (  9 ) .",
    "the predictive power of the model is illustrated in  10 , where the evolution of the morphological populations with redshift is predicted , under cdm initial conditions , in the field as well as in denser environments . throughout the paper ,",
    "the case for an einstein - de sitter ( @xmath0 ) with a hubble constant @xmath5 km / s / mpc is assumed .",
    "we characterize galaxy collisions in terms of the rate of change of binding energy @xmath6 of a galaxy colliding with an other .",
    "this can be expressed in a general form for a test galaxy ( of mass @xmath7 and radius @xmath8 ) interacting with a set of background galaxies ( of mass @xmath9 and radius @xmath10 ) with relative velocity @xmath11 as ( richstone 1975 ; ag85 ) : @xmath12 where @xmath13 stands for @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is the number density of background galaxies , and @xmath16 the internal velocity dispersion of the test galaxy . the dimensionless function @xmath17 is plotted in figure 8 of ag85 for equal masses galaxies .",
    "it is easy to see from this figure that @xmath17 scales roughly as the square of the ratio @xmath18 so that equation ( [ eq1 ] ) simply reads as : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the slope of the function @xmath17 and is equal to @xmath21 ( ag85 ; figure 8) . for unequal galaxy masses , two modifications of ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "may be anticipated : 1 ) @xmath8 should be replaced by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , and 2 ) powers of the mass ratio @xmath24 may appear . for a test galaxy @xmath25 perturbed by a set of background galaxies",
    "@xmath26 with distribution @xmath27 , the perturbation @xmath28 on the stellar velocity field can be estimated from the impulse approximation ( spitzer 1958 ) and straight line trajectories ( provided @xmath29 ) to be : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the impact parameter which for the dominant contribution to the rate of energy exchange can be taken to approximately equal @xmath22 . using",
    "the virial theorem for the test galaxy , equation ( [ eq3 ] ) becomes : @xmath32 for equal mass galaxies , we have from ( [ eq4 ] ) that @xmath33 so that @xmath13 scales as @xmath34 - equation ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "we assume this still holds for unequal masses with @xmath35 given by ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "the rate for energy exchange now reads as : @xmath36 where the integral is performed over the masses of background galaxies . as equation ( [ eq5 ] ) relies on the impulse approximation and straight line trajectories , it is valid only for @xmath29",
    ". this latter condition is fulfilled in galaxy clusters , for example , as the relative velocity between galaxies is expected to be of the order of the cluster velocity dispersion @xmath37 km / s , whereas the internal velocity dispersion of galaxies is of the order of @xmath38 km / s . in the field ,",
    "the relative velocity of colliding galaxies may be of the same order as their internal velocity dispersion and the relative trajectories can not be approximated by straight lines .",
    "the focusing due to mutual attraction can be easily incorporated into equation ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath31 and @xmath11 are the initial impact parameter and relative velocity , energy conservation during the collision implies that , in the frame of the reduced particle of mass @xmath39 : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the relative velocity at closest approach @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the gravitational constant .",
    "conservation of momentum per unit mass @xmath44 implies @xmath45 from which we get : @xmath46\\approx r_{col}^2[1+\\frac{2g(m_>)}{r_{col}v^2}]\\ ] ] using the virial theorem for the largest of the two colliding galaxies ( of mass @xmath47 and internal velocity dispersion @xmath48 ) , we have : @xmath49\\ ] ] taking @xmath50 , gravitational focusing roughly amounts to multiplying @xmath51 in equation ( [ eq5 ] ) by the factor @xmath52 for a similar reason , the relative velocity entering equation ( [ eq3 ] ) is increased by the square root of ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "however , the energy taken out of the relative motion to be injected into the internal stellar motions lowers the relative motion in a similar way . if @xmath53 , the two effects nearly cancel each other . we do not attempt to model these fairly complex processes , but simply use the rate ( [ eq5 ] ) modified by the factor ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "the scaling with mass of the latter is needed in order to take into account the strong attraction produced by large galaxies , and will be important for the scaling of the rate of change of energy with mass and redshift .",
    "we now integrate ( [ eq5 ] ) over the masses of the background galaxies .",
    "we use @xmath54 , the radius of the test galaxy , so that the test galaxy is larger , on average , than the background galaxies .",
    "we define @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the mean density in the universe and @xmath57 is the mass fraction in galaxies , so that we get : @xmath58 and @xmath59 where @xmath60 in equation ( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq11 ] ) is defined by : @xmath61 @xmath60 is dominated by the larger masses due to the @xmath9 factors : hence , we expect @xmath60 to be close to the mass of the larger galaxies .    to summarize this section , we have obtained scaling relations for the rate of change of binding energy as a function of the various parameters characterizing the colliding galaxies .",
    "table 1 gives a list of the names and meaning of the parameters used so far .",
    "table 2 summarizes the results we shall build our model on in the next sections , and the various assumptions used . +",
    "the rate of change of binding energy for a galaxy interacting with surrounding galaxies , between redshift @xmath62 and @xmath63 is @xmath64 where @xmath13 has been given by ( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq11 ] ) in the previous section . integrating ( [ eq13 ] ) over time from the redshift of formation @xmath65 of the galaxy up to redshift @xmath62 yields the total increase of binding energy due to a series of collisions experienced by the galaxy during its lifetime .",
    "this integrated quantity characterizes what we shall call the collision history of a galaxy .",
    "to evaluate this quantity , we need to use the relevant scaling with redshift of the various quantities entering equations ( [ eq10 ] ) , ( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) , which have been listed in table 1 .",
    "these scalings will be different in cluster and field environments .",
    "we shall therefore distinguish from now on the cases for cluster and field galaxies .",

    "this is important for evaluating the number density of background galaxies , as only a subset of all mass condensations counted for by the press & schechter prescription ( [ eq13a ] ) are actual galaxies .",
    "the condition for cooling to be effective is a condition on the relative importance of the cooling time - scale and the dynamical time - scale .",
    "various processes contribute to gas cooling . assuming that during the collapse , the gas is shock heated and reaches virial temperature before settling into a disk , we are led to consider only those cooling processes that are efficient at temperatures of the order of the virial temperature . for simplicity , we assume that line cooling is the dominant mechanism , and shall adopt the following cooling function for gas temperatures of the order @xmath82 k ( e.g. , sutherland & dopita 1993 ) : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the particle density of the gas within a galaxy and @xmath85 the virial temperature . zero metallicity has been assumed .",

    "similarly , we expect little effect in the lower density regions of clusters . in the very high density regions of rich clusters , however , the energy exchange due to collisions is high and is given by equation ( [ eq10 ] ) with @xmath120 replaced by the local density @xmath121 and @xmath11 by the local galaxy velocity dispersion of the cluster .",

    "by use of the virial theorem and ( [ eq25 ] ) , the velocity dispersion @xmath11 can be expressed as a function of the cluster density @xmath121 : @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the cluster velocity dispersion at radius @xmath129 . as expected for @xmath132 ,",
    "the velocity dispersion of a given cluster is constant and independent of the density @xmath121 .",
    "this velocity , however , is not the same for all clusters since it depends on @xmath128 : @xmath133 the collision factor ( [ eq23 ] ) scales , in this simple case , as @xmath134 we can relate the cluster density @xmath121 to the local galaxy number density @xmath84 by assuming that galaxies trace mass , that is @xmath135 .",
    "we shall however adopt a somewhat more realistic model for the cluster density profile , namely an isothermal @xmath136 model ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 ) in which the galaxy number density in the cluster is related to the gas density profile @xmath137 by : @xmath138 where @xmath136 is a fitting parameter to the projected x - ray surface brightness of the cluster ( jones & forman 1984 ) .",

    "the scaling with density of the collision factor ( [ eq31 ] ) will be quite different in these two cases .",
    "it is of interest of considering case 2 ) for the purpose of comparing the predictions of our model to observations , which we will present later in this paper .",
    "for example , ( [ eq31 ] ) can be averaged , at a fixed galaxy number density @xmath84 , over a set of clusters with varying central density @xmath143 .",
    "bahcall ( 1979 ) shows that the distribution of abell clusters decreases as a function of luminosity @xmath44 according to a schechter law @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the cluster optical luminosity within the abell radius @xmath146 . assuming that the cluster optical luminosity is proportional to the galaxy number density",
    ", the central density distribution of abell clusters is @xmath147 with @xmath148 .",
    "the collision factor ( [ eq31 ] ) averaged at fixed @xmath84 over the distribution ( [ eq33 ] ) for @xmath149 is then @xmath150 where @xmath151 denotes average over ( [ eq33 ] ) : @xmath152 where the function @xmath153 is defined by : @xmath154.\\ ] ] @xmath155 is dominated by the contribution of densities @xmath156 and behaves roughly as @xmath157 .",
    "thus , ( [ eq34 ] ) becomes @xmath158 in the following , we will use equation ( [ eq37 ] ) for the purpose of evaluating the morphology - density relation in our model .",
    "several differences in the collision factor in the two environments considered originate from the different scalings used in these two cases :    * in the field , the collision factor depends essentially on the present day density of the universe , whereas in clusters , @xmath114 is a function of the local density @xmath121 . as a consequence , the energy exchange in clusters are generally much more important than in the field , and depend on the environment , since they increase with increasing density .",
    "* in the field , collisions at high redshift are more efficient ( in terms of the fractional rate of change of binding energy per collision ( [ eq18 ] ) ) than recent collisions .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the strong increase of the average density of the universe with redshift .",
    "this effect overseeds the fact that collisions for galaxies with small radii ( that is , at a given mass , those formed at high @xmath65 - equation ( [ eq15 ] ) ) , are less efficient than for large galaxies .",
    "thus , at a given mass , ( [ eq20 ] ) implies that the higher the redshift of formation of a galaxy , the higher the collision factor . on the contrary , in a given cluster ,",
    "the fractional rate of change of binding energy per collision ( [ eq22 ] ) is constant in time , as soon as the cluster has virialized . at a given mass , the higher the redshift of formation of the galaxy , the lower the galaxy radius ( [ eq15 ] ) , and the lower the collision factor ( [ eq23 ] )",
    "a key phenomenon to understand when elaborating a consistent picture of galaxy formation is the angular momentum history of galaxies of various hubble types .",
    "it is believed that the angular momentum of primeval galaxies originates from tidal torques induced by the presence of neighboring galaxies ( doroshkevich 1970 ; white 1984 ) . at the early epochs of galaxy formation , protogalaxies",
    "indeed interact strongly with their surroundings .",
    "the angular momentum acquired at that time may have a definitive impact on galaxy morphologies .",
    "it would be however misleading to associate isolated structures , i.e. , objects that are less subject to tidal torquing , with elliptical galaxies . following this argument",
    ", one would then expect to find fewer low - spin galaxies in high density environments , a prediction in disagreement with the observation of an increasing fraction of early - types when one goes towards richer clusters ( dressler 1980 ) .",
    "it is unlikely that the large amount of spin needed to rotationally support fully grown disk galaxies may be explained solely by the primordial angular momentum ( e.g. , barnes & efstathiou 1987 ) .",
    "dissipative collapse of the radiatively cooled gas in a dark halo must be invoked .",
    "assuming that the gas angular momentum is conserved during the collapse phase , one needs a collapse by a factor 10 to achieve rotational support ( fall & efstathiou 1980 ) .",
    "a large initial angular momentum is not a sufficient condition for the formation of disk galaxies , as various processes , such as tidal interactions occurring during the lifetime of a galaxy , may induce angular momentum transport from the galaxy center to the outer parts .",
    "thus an initially rapidly rotating protogalaxy could end up as an elliptical galaxy .",
    "recent simulations indeed find an extremely high efficiency of angular momentum transfer resulting in disks that are far too small .",
    "even if the gas starts to sink towards the galactic center , the settlement into a disk structure requires a gentle infall that could be perturbed by the tidal field .",
    "indeed , modeling of disk formation as well as chemical evolution models ( lacey & fall 1983 ; rocca - volmerange & schaeffer 1990 ) supports slow disk formation via gas infall from a pre - existing halo .",
    "spirals are found to have a relatively constant rate of star formation over the past 10 gyr , and infall provides a possible means of regulating the gas supply and maintaining the disk in a state of marginal gravitational instability ( sellwood & carlberg 1984 ) .",
    "however , as soon as a protogalactic cloud collapses and decouples from the universal expansion , collisions are expected to occur due to its relative velocity with respect to other clouds .",
    "virialization should be effective within one or a few hubble times after formation and collisions during this period are not expected to greatly modify the final structure .",
    "more recent collisions , however , would inhibit the gentle infall of the gas needed to allow for the formation of a disk .",
    "clearly , the collision history over the whole life of a galaxy since its epoch of formation should be taken into account if one wants to predict its morphological type .",
    "the previous discussion leads us to define , in the framework of our model , the morphological types as follows : the condition for a spiral galaxy to form out of a cloud that first became non - linear at a redshift @xmath65 is to experience few , if any , collisions between the epoch of its formation and the epoch under consideration .",
    "strong collisions will , on the contrary , prevent the gas from settling into a disk and allow for tidal exchanges that average out angular momentum .",
    "we shall consequently assume that a sizeable number of collisions between @xmath65 and the epoch characterized by @xmath62 leads to the formation of elliptical galaxies .",
    "these rules for the formation of morphological types can be expressed in terms of conditions on the collision factor @xmath114 , for field and/or cluster galaxies . at any redshift @xmath62 , the collision factor for a spiral galaxy",
    "is assumed to satisfy the following condition : @xmath159 where @xmath160 is a redshift independent threshold on the collision factor and is a free parameter in this model .",

    "competing theories have been developed by the advocates of the nature hypothesis ( evrard 1990 ) .",
    "these various approaches suffer however from a number of problems : while the evrard ( 1990 ) model fails to reproduce the observed morphology - density relation for s0 and spiral galaxies , the result of removing the gas content of spiral galaxies by stripping would lead to s0-like galaxies , but not ellipticals , as stripping should not affect the stellar content of the stripped galaxy . besides , burstein ( 1979 ) observed that s0s seem to have thicker disks than spirals , which is difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis that spiral galaxies evolved into s0 by gas stripping .",
    "the present model lies somewhat in between the nature and nurture hypothesis .",
    "it is of interest to test its predictions for the morphology - density relation .",
    "we undertake this task in this section .    in order to evaluate the local morphology - density relation in our model ,",

    "observationally ( postman & geller 1984 ) , the morphological populations are rather constant up to @xmath247 mpc@xmath191 ( @xmath67=0.5 ) .",
    "accordingly , we fix the value of @xmath246 so that @xmath126 starts to dominate over @xmath245 at @xmath247 mpc@xmath191 .",

    "a typical 1-@xmath3 error bar is shown for reference in the top panel ( from postman & geller 1984 ) .",
    "the model reproduces qualitatively the main features observed in the evolution with density of the proportions of morphological types : the spiral population decreases quite strongly in higher density environments , while this decrease is compensated by a corresponding increase of the elliptical and s0 populations .",
    "the agreement is actually rather good quantitatively also , at least for low and intermediate densities . at high densities ( @xmath255 mpc@xmath191 ) ,",
    "the model overestimates slightly the fraction of spirals , while the predicted fraction of ellipticals is somewhat lower than observed .    reproducing the observed morphology - density relation",

    "the values of these parameters and the method used to determine them is summarized in table 4 .",
    "the predictions of the model are quite sensitive to @xmath136 and @xmath246 .",
    "for example , if we use the assumption that mass traces light in clusters , i.e. @xmath256 , the model yields a decrease ( an increase ) of the spiral ( elliptical ) population at high density _ sharper _ than the ones observed . if we vary the value of @xmath246 , the density at which @xmath126 starts to dominate over @xmath245 is different from the observed value @xmath257 mpc@xmath191 .",
    "it is however remarkable that the model simultaneously reproduces the morphology - density for the three hubble types considered .",

    "is that the redshift cut @xmath252 is lower in a high density environment than in the field , implying that cluster ellipticals form at a lower redshift than in the field , as tidal collisions in clusters are more efficient than in the field at converting disks into ellipticals .      at any redshift",

    "all the results presented below assume the cdm spectrum ( [ eq13c ] ) normalized to @xmath269 .",
    "so far , we have considered only three morphological types .",
    "however , observations at high redshift show the existence of a large population of so - called irregular galaxies ( brinchmann 1997 ) . these galaxies are morphologically perturbed , gas - rich , star forming galaxies with blue colors .",
    "there is a simple way to define irregular galaxies in our model . among all galaxies",
    "having experienced substantial energy exchanges during tidal collisions ( essentially those that are ellipticals today ) , we can differentiate between those galaxies that have relaxed by the time characterized by redshift @xmath62 and those that have not .",
    "the motivation for such a distinction is that unrelaxed galaxies may exhibit the disturbed morphology of observed irregulars , while relaxed galaxies are expected to show a smoother stellar distribution , as in ellipticals .",
    "moreover , tidal collisions are likely to induce star formation in the interacting galaxies , and we can anticipate that the irregulars of our model should be star - forming galaxies and have blue colors , in qualitative agreement with observations . however , part of the galactic gas is likely to be removed during collisions , and it is not clear whether irregulars in our model will have retained enough gas to form stars .",
    "clearly , modeling of the effect of collisions on star formation and the physics of the gas is required .",
    "such models are beyond the scope of the present paper and we shall restrict ourselves to the present definition .",
    "our definition of irregular galaxies thus amounts to introduction of a new redshift cut , @xmath270 .",
    "it is fixed by requiring that the elapsed time between the epoch of the last collision and the epoch characterized by @xmath62 equals a typical time - scale for relaxation .",
    "those galaxies that were formed at redshift higher than @xmath270 will have relaxed by redshift @xmath62 and will be identified as ellipticals . in the opposite case , these galaxies will be irregulars. in practice , we assume that relaxation occurs on a time - scale @xmath271 typically of the order of a dynamical time - scale @xmath272 , that is @xmath273 where @xmath121 is the density of the universe at the time of formation @xmath65 .",
    "the epoch of the last collision is more problematic to evaluate .",
    "actually , in our picture , they may not be any _ epoch of a last collision _ as collisions continuously occur over the lifetime of a galaxy .",
    "however , the bulk of collisions must occur at high redshift when the density of the universe is high .",
    "the redshift @xmath252 ( or a fraction of it ) may be taken as the redshift of last collision , though more minor collisions may occur at lower redshift .",
    "there is some freedom in the choice of this epoch so that the definition of irregulars in our scenario is somewhat loose .",
    "figure 6 shows the evolution of the population content for field galaxies .",
    "the main observed trends in the evolution of the galactic content of the universe are reproduced by our model : the fraction of field spirals decreases with increasing redshift as collisions in the past were more efficient at disrupting disk - forming galaxies .",
    "they make up 65% of the galaxy population today and only about 15% at redshift 3 .",
    "the fraction of ellipticals rises smoothly from about 10% today to about 20% at redshift @xmath274 , then starts decreasing while the fraction of irregulars takes over rapidly and starts to dominate at redshift @xmath275 .",
    "we note that the substantial rise of the irregular fraction at redshift @xmath276 is , at least qualitatively , consistent with a recent analysis of the peculiar / irregular populations of the cfrs and ldss redshift surveys ( brinchmann 1997 ) .",
    "figures 7 and 8 show the evolution of the galaxy population with increasing density of the environment .",
    "we take @xmath277 mpc@xmath191 in figure 7 and @xmath266 mpc@xmath191 in figure 8 . at high redshift , where @xmath245 dominates over @xmath126 in equation ( [ eq65 ] ) , the fractions of galaxy types",
    "are essentially the same as in the field .",
    "going towards lower redshifts , the fraction of spiral galaxies increases less rapidly than in the field , peaks around @xmath278 ( figure 7 ) and steadily drops from 55% to 50% at the present time .",
    "this decrease is compensated by a corresponding increase of the s0 and elliptical fractions , while the irregular population is quite unaffected .",
    "thus , the cluster core is depleted from its spiral population as a direct consequence of the high density in the core , while it is populated by s0 and ellipticals . in figure 8 ,",
    "similar behavior is noticed : the predicted fractions start to depart from the field fractions at redshift @xmath279 , as expected from inspection of figure 5 , with the peak in the spiral fraction occurring at a somewhat larger redshift than in figure 7 .",
    "the drop of the fraction of spirals is more pronounced and goes from 45% at redshift @xmath280 to 25% at the present time .",
    "it is temptative to associate the decrease of the fraction of spirals from intermediate redshift to the present with the well known butcher - oemler effect ( butcher & oemler 1978 ; dressler 1994 ) .",
    "indeed , tidal collisions occurring shortly after cluster formation might induce star formation in spirals , that then would appear similar to the blue butcher - oemler galaxies , while exhaustion and/or stripping of the gas content during subsequent collisions would transform spirals into s0s and ellipticals .",
    "clearly , inclusion of collision induced star formation and gas physics in our model is needed for any detailed investigation of its predictions with respect to the butcher - oemler effect .",
    "we have argued that galaxy collisions play a fundamental role in galaxy formation .",
    "we have built a model in which galaxy morphological types originate as a result of gravitational interactions with surrounding galaxies .",
    "simple rules for energy exchange during collisions have been proposed that allow us to discriminate between different hubble types : efficient collisions result in the disruption of disks and substantial star formation , leading to the formation of ellipticals ; few or inefficient collisions in the past allowed a large gas reservoir to survive and form disks",
    ". quantitative analysis of energy exchanges in the field and cluster environments have been presented .",
    "these analyses are based on the simulation results of aguilar & white ( 1985 ) .",
    "assuming that galaxy formation proceeds in a @xmath0 cold dark matter universe , our model both reproduces a number of observations and makes various predictions , among which are the redshifts of formation of the different hubble types in the field . when the model is normalized to the present day abundance of x - ray clusters , we find that the amount of energy exchange needed to produce ellipticals implies that they formed by @xmath281 while spirals formed at @xmath282 .",
    "the model also provides a natural basis for biasing between field spirals and ellipticals without requiring an _ ad - hoc _ identification of morphological types to peaks of different height in the initial density field .",
    "field elliptical galaxies are found to be more biased with respect to mass than spiral galaxies by a factor @xmath283 .",
    "they preferentially form out of @xmath284 peaks , whereas spiral galaxies condense out of @xmath285 peaks .",
    "our formalism allows us to study galactic evolution in clusters . with the same collision rules as in the field , the model satisfactorily reproduces the morphology - density relation which spans a range of densities from 10@xmath286 to 10@xmath287 galaxies per mpc@xmath288 .",
    "finally , the predictive power of the model is exploited to predict the evolution of galaxy populations with redshift .",
    "the predicted trends are in good qualitative agreement with observations , both in the field and in clusters .",
    "our modeling of collisions in clusters naturally gives rise to a butcher - oemler - like effect , observed in the predicted spiral population .",
    "however , inclusion in our model of gas physics and collision induced star formation is required for any detailed quantitative comparison of the predictions of our model to observations .",
    "such a comparison will be undertaken in a forthcoming paper .",

    "<S> we present a semi - analytical model in which galaxy collisions and strong tidal interactions , both in the field and during the collapse phase of groups and clusters help determine galaxy morphology . from a semi - analytical analysis based on simulation results of tidal collisions </S>",
    "<S> ( aguilar & white 1985 ) , we propose simple rules for energy exchanges during collisions that allow to discriminate between different hubble types : efficient collisions result in the disruption of disks and substantial star formation , leading to the formation of elliptical galaxies ; inefficient collisions allow a large gas reservoir to survive and form disks . assuming that galaxy formation proceeds in a @xmath0 cold dark matter universe , the model both reproduces a number of observations and makes predictions , among which are the redshifts of formation of the different hubble types in the field . </S>",
    "<S> when the model is normalized to the present day abundance of x - ray clusters , the amount of energy exchange needed to produce elliptical galaxies in the field implies that they formed at @xmath1 while spiral galaxies formed at @xmath2 . </S>",

    "<S> we find that the present day morphology - density relation in the field is well reproduced under the collision hypothesis . </S>",
