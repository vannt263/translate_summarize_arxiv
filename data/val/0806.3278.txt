    "however , the size of wu05 s sample is a little small ( only have @xmath42 80 galaxies ) and the mir luminosities of their sample galaxies only cover a range of two orders of magnitude . in this work , we construct a large sample of @xmath87 star - forming galaxies with the mir luminosities range of three orders of magnitude . besides correlating well with h@xmath0 luminosities , the mir luminosities of our sample galaxies",
    "are also found to have tight correlations with tir and fuv luminosities .",

    "although the correlations between l(mir ) with l(h@xmath0 ) & l(tir ) are somewhat nonlinear , the nonlinearities of the above two correlations are generally less than 10% .",
    "therefore , we can adopt linear correlations for calibrating sfrs ( sfrs derived from non - linear correlations between l(mir ) with other luminosities also were illustrated in figure  [ fig13 ] ) . based on the three linear correlations of l(mir)-l(h@xmath0 ) , l(mir)-l(tir ) and l(mir)-l(fuv )",

    "these factors are in good agreement with those of l(mir)-l(h@xmath0 ) and l(mir)-l(radio ) correlations by wu05 with differences less than 10% ( figure  [ fig13 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the differences in l(8@xmath3m[dust])-l(h@xmath0 ) correlations between wu05 s sample and ours are mainly because of the galaxies with very low mir luminosities .",
    "however , it must be noted that the mir sfr formulae ( especially for 8@xmath3m(dust ) ) derived above can not be applied to dwarf galaxies ( and other galaxies with low metallicity ; @xcite ) , since they deviate much from the linear correlations for normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "however , the deviation of dwarfs to normal star - forming galaxies in figure  [ fig5 ] is apparently smaller than in figure  [ fig4 ]",
    ". therefore , it may be a simple and feasible method of using the combined observed h@xmath0 + mir luminosities to compute sfrs .",
    "the black solid line in figure  [ fig13 ] show the equation to compute sfr based on 24@xmath3 m luminosity given by @xcite ( their equation 3 ) , which was derived from the correlation between 24@xmath3 m and h@xmath0 luminosities for 30 lirgs in the local universe , and this equation is similar to the one by @xcite except for different imfs .",
    "we should keep in mind such large differences for infrared luminous galaxies .    for tir emission ,",
    "the contribution from dust heating by the old stellar population could not be ignored ( @xmath1130% for normal galaxies , @xcite ) ; while for uv emission , except for the pollution from old star , the effect of intrinsic extinction is even stronger than that for h@xmath0 emission . although the standard deviations of the fitting residuals from tir ( 0.07 for 24@xmath3 m , 0.06 for 8@xmath3m(dust ) ) are smaller than from h@xmath0 ( 0.16 , 0.18 respectively ) , the h@xmath0 emission trace the hii region surrounded massive star more directly .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the mir - derived sfr based on the mir vs. h@xmath0 correlation is `` better '' than those derived from other correlations .",
    "the mir luminosities l(mir ) are mainly from pah and warm dust ( vsgs ) emissions , while fir luminosities l(fir ) are dominated by cold dust emissions from large grains . from figure  [ fig6 ] , and comparing with the correlations between l(mir ) and l(h@xmath0 ) shown in figure  [ fig4 ] and table  [ tab3 ] , we find that the mir luminosities correlate better with l(fir ) than l(h@xmath0 ) , and this result is consistent with that from @xcite for late - type galaxies observed by @xmath9 .",
    "however , correlations shown in figures  [ fig4 ] and  [ fig6 ] are on the basis of two different ( mir & fir ) samples .",
    "therefore , we firstly checked the distributions of absolute b - band magnitude , redshift , @xmath45 color , and ew(h@xmath0 ) for both mir and fir sample galaxies ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) , and found the two samples have similar distributions . to avoid possible selection effect , the l(mir)-l(h@xmath0 ) correlations for fir sample galaxies",
    "are also shown in figure  [ fig14 ] .",
    "the best fits for galaxies in the fir sample are consistent with those for wu05 and mir sample galaxies .",
    "the standard deviations for the fir sample are about 0.15 , a little smaller than those for the mir sample , since the fir sample do not include galaxies with l(mir ) @xmath42 10@xmath89@xmath90 ; while their spearman rank - order correlation analysis coefficients are similar to those of the mir sample . from the comparison described above , we confirm that the mir luminosities are better correlated with fir than h@xmath0 luminosities for star - forming galaxies .",
    "as described in @xmath134.3 and shown in figure  [ fig6 ] , among the four l(mir)-l(fir ) correlations , l(24@xmath3m)-l(70@xmath3 m ) and l(8@xmath3m[dust])-l(160@xmath3 m ) have much smaller scatters ( the standard deviation of the fitting residuals are both 0.07 ) than the rest two correlations of l(24@xmath3m)-l(160@xmath3 m ) and l(8@xmath3m[dust])-l(70@xmath3 m ) ( the standard deviation of the fitting residuals are 0.12 and 0.10 respectively ) .",
    "furthermore , the slopes of both l(24@xmath3m)-l(70@xmath3 m ) and l(8@xmath3m[dust])-l(160@xmath3 m ) correlations are close to unity , which indicates that such correlations are almost linear . the above results hint that the 24@xmath3 m vs. 70@xmath3 m , and 8@xmath3 m vs. 160@xmath3 m emissions may have similar physical origins : + @xmath91(a ) the 24@xmath3 m emission is known to be dominated by warm dust emissions from vsgs , which are mainly heated by young massive stars .",
    "recent results by @xmath1 @xcite have shown that the 24@xmath3 m luminosity is one of the best sfr indicators .",
    "previous works based on @xmath7 and @xmath9 observations have proved that the fir luminosity is also a good sfr tracer because of the emission peak around 60@xmath3 m of dust heated by star formation , thus the 70@xmath3 m emission must be closely related to star formation activities and should have tight and linear correlation with 24@xmath3 m warm dust emission .",
    "+ @xmath91(b ) the 8@xmath3m(dust ) luminosity was also thought to be a sfr tracer by some authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "8@xmath3 m dust emissions include emissions from both pahs and vsgs . in star - forming galaxies ,",
    "the 7.7@xmath3 m pah emission dominates the 8@xmath3 m band @xcite and its strength is likely to be affected by many factors , such as the radiation field and metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , pah emissions trace b star better than young o stars @xcite .",
    "therefore , the 8@xmath3m(dust ) luminosity may not be an optimal sfr tracer , and this could explain why the 70@xmath3 m luminosities have better correlation with 24@xmath3 m rather than 8@xmath3m(dust ) luminosities .",
    "+ @xmath91(c ) the 160@xmath3 m emission is mainly from cold dust heated by old stars and is thought to locate in the diffuse regions of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the tight l(8@xmath3m[dust])-l(160@xmath3 m ) correlation indicates that the 8@xmath3m(dust ) and 160@xmath3 m emissions might be from the same regions of galaxies , i.e. , cold dust emission could exists in pdrs and it is also possible that there exists pah emission in the diffuse regions because pahs can be pumped by cool stars with less uv radiation @xcite . due to the low spatial resolution and shallowness of @xmath1 160@xmath3",
    "m observations , firm conclusions on the physical connection between 8@xmath3m(dust ) and 160@xmath3 m emissions and their distributions in galaxies must await high quality fir data from future space telescopes ( e.g. , @xmath92 ) .",

    "<S> correlations for star - forming galaxies , the l(24@xmath3 m ) vs. l(70@xmath3 m ) and l(8@xmath3m[dust ] ) vs. l(160@xmath3 m ) are the tightest and also nearly linear . </S>",
    "<S> the former could be related to young massive star formation , while the latter might be relevant to diffuse dust emissions heated by old stellar populations . </S>",
    "<S> composite galaxies and agns have higher mir - to - h@xmath0/mir - to - fuv luminosity ratios than star - forming galaxies , nevertheless their correlations among mir , fir and tir luminosities are completely following those of star - forming galaxies . </S>"
