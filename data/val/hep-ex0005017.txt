    "the first work to search for the decay @xmath5 was performed in 1987 @xcite .",
    "the observation of this decay based on analysis of the data of the phi96 experiment @xcite was reported in 1997 @xcite by the snd detector @xcite .",
    "observed decay rate of about @xmath6 was unexpectedly high and it was also shown that @xmath3 intermediate state dominates in this decay . later these results were confirmed by the cmd-2 experiment @xcite .    in this work results",
    "are presented of a new experimental study of the process @xmath7 based on complete snd statistics of about @xmath8 produced @xmath9 mesons .",
    "the experiments were carried out at vepp-2 m @xmath0 collider in novosibirsk .",
    "the total integrated luminosity collected in phi96 @xcite and phi98 @xcite experiments was @xmath10 in 20 energy points and @xmath11 in the 16 energy points respectively .",
    "main resonant background to the reaction ( [ eq0 ] ) comes from the process @xmath12 due to the merging of photons and/or loss of photons through the openings in the calorimeter .",
    "a smaller background comes from the decay mode @xcite @xmath13 copiously produced @xmath14 events may contribute to the background but this decay is almost completely rejected by our cuts .",
    "the main source of non - resonant background is the process @xmath15 the qed background from @xmath0 annihilation into @xmath16 was found negligible .",
    "the data analysis was described in detail in our previous publications @xcite . in this work",
    "basically the same selection cuts were used requiring five isolated photons in the calorimeter with good shower profiles and event kinematics consistent with the @xmath17 hypothesis ( 93  % c.l . ) . to suppress spurious photons from beams background all photons with energies less than @xmath18 at angles with respect to the beams",
    "less than 36 degrees were excluded from further analysis .",
    "the rate of events with spurious photons was about 4  % in phi96 experiment and 8  % in phi98 . to account for this effect during processing of simulated events spurious hits , taken from the experiment ,",
    "were admixed to monte carlo ones .    after applying cuts the sample of the @xmath17 candidates",
    "was selected ( fig.[fig6]a ) .",
    "the main background is due to the process ( [ eq3 ] ) but processes ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq1a ] ) contribute to this event sample also .",
    "the estimated number of events of the reaction ( [ eq0 ] ) in fig.[fig6]a is @xmath19 .",
    "the detection efficiency ( fig.[fig6]b ) for the process ( [ eq0 ] ) as a function of @xmath20 invariant mass was determined using simulation of the process @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a scalar state with a mass ranging from 300 to @xmath23 .",
    "the whole mass range was divided into 19 bins and within each bin simulation with uniform @xmath24 distribution was performed .",
    "this simulation was used for determination of the @xmath20 invariant mass resolution and event misidentification probabilities as well .    for the background process ( [ eq3 ] )",
    "the @xmath25 invariant mass distribution is peaked at @xmath26-meson mass .",
    "the @xmath27 parameter is an invariant mass of the recoil photon and one of @xmath28 mesons , closest to the @xmath26-meson mass ( fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "events with @xmath29 are mainly ones of the process ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "moreover in the energy range of the experiment @xmath20 invariant mass in the process ( [ eq3 ] ) must be lower than @xmath30 . for further analysis",
    "the selected @xmath17 events were divided into three classes :    1 .",
    "@xmath31 and not ( [ op ] ) ; 2 .",
    "@xmath32 and not ( [ op ] ) ; 3 .",
    "@xmath31 and ( [ op ] ) .    in the second class the @xmath33 mechanism dominates , in the third",
    " the process ( [ eq3 ] ) .    for events of the second and third classes the experimental and simulated distributions in @xmath34 and @xmath35 angles",
    "were compared .",
    "the @xmath34 is an angle of the recoil photon with respect to pion direction in the @xmath20 center of mass reference frame .",
    "the @xmath35 is an angle between recoil photon and the beam .",
    "it can be seen in fig.[fig5]a , c that in the second class the distribution well matches one expected for the intermediate scalar state .",
    "corresponding distributions in the third class agree with ones expected for the intermediate @xmath36 state ( fig.[fig5]b , d ) .",
    "the visible cross sections @xmath37 were measured for each energy point in both phi96 and phi98 experiments , here @xmath38 and @xmath39 is a class number ( @xmath39=1,2,3 ) defined above .",
    "these cross sections were fitted according to the following formulae : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a cross section for the @xmath42-th @xmath24 interval ( @xmath43 for @xmath44 , @xmath45 for @xmath46 ) , @xmath47 are probabilities for the @xmath17 events belonging to @xmath42-th @xmath24 interval to be detected as the class @xmath39 events ( tabl.[t96],[t98 ] ) , @xmath48 are production cross sections of the final state @xmath49 ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath36 ) , @xmath52 are detection efficiencies of the state @xmath49 in the class @xmath39 , @xmath53  radiative corrections and corrections to the energy spread in the beam @xcite .",
    "the expression for the @xmath54 was taken from ref.@xcite , the values of the @xmath55 as well as @xmath56 were taken from our previous work @xcite .",
    "the efficiencies @xmath47 were estimated using the experimental mass spectrum and the simulation of @xmath57 events described in the previous section . for the cross sections @xmath58 ( f is @xmath17 or @xmath59 ) the following expression",
    "was used : @xmath60 here the inverse propagator of @xmath9 was written according to ref.@xcite : @xmath61 and the energy dependence of partial widths @xmath62 was taken from ref.@xcite .",
    "the branching ratio of the decay ( [ eq1a ] ) was obtained in snd work @xcite .",
    "note , that there is a dip in the cross section ( [ eq3 ] ) at the @xmath9-meson mass , due to destructive interference between the main non - resonance process , the @xmath63 decay , and the process @xmath64    to check the accuracy of the detection efficiency , obtained by simulation , fully reconstructed events of the process ( [ eq1 ] ) with 7 photons in the final state were analyzed . since this process is similar to ( [ eq0 ] ) ,",
    "the energy , invariant mass , and angular cuts were the same as in @xmath17 analysis , while threshold values for kinematic fitting parameters were scaled to provide same confidence level .",
    "obtained branching ratio of the decay ( [ eq1 ] ) was smaller than that from the snd experiment @xcite @xmath65 by a factor of @xmath66 .",
    "this value was taken as a correction factor for both effect and background .",
    "this correction accounts for imprecise simulation of tails of distributions of parameters used in the cuts .",
    "free parameters of the fit were the branching ratios in the @xmath9-meson peak @xmath67 in two intervals of @xmath24 ( tabl.[t96],[t98 ] ) .",
    "uncertainties in the values of @xmath68 , detection efficiencies , integrated luminosity , and energy spread of the beam were taken into account .",
    "the value of @xmath69 was fixed to its snd value , so our results are normalized to the branching ratio of the decay @xmath70 .",
    "the fitting results for both experiments are shown in the table  [ tf ] , corresponding curves for phi98 are shown in fig.[figsigma ] . because the most of @xmath17 events concentrate at high @xmath24 similar analysis",
    "was performed for the mass range @xmath71 .",
    "because the fitting results for the phi96 and phi98 experiments are in a good agreement with each other ( tabl .",
    "[ tf ] ) they was combined : @xmath72 in ( [ eq60][eq61 ] ) the first error is statistical and the second one is systematic , which is determined mainly by current accuracy of @xmath69 ( 4  % ) and model uncertainty ( 2  % ) of @xmath73 in the formula ( [ eqppg ] ) . from the data ( [ eq60 ] ) and ( [ eq61 ] ) one can evaluate the total value @xmath74 which is the total branching ratio excluding @xmath63 contribution , because the kinematic region of this decay is excluded by our cuts .",
    "it was studied in the snd work @xcite , from which one can obtain the branching ratio to the @xmath36 region @xmath75 and add it to ( [ eq62 ] ) to find the total branching ratio @xmath76 in this work the branching ratios were measured relatively to @xmath69 . in such approach some systematic errors cancel allowing smaller total systematic uncertainties : @xmath77    to investigate the dynamics of the reaction ( [ eq0 ] ) the @xmath20 invariant mass spectrum ( fig.[fig6]a ) was studied in a narrower energy interval @xmath78 containing almost all @xmath9-meson events and smaller @xmath36 background .",
    "the estimated background from the processes ( [ eq1][eq3 ] ) was subtracted using snd data @xcite .",
    "resulting raw mass spectrum is distorted due to finite detector resolution and misidentification of recoil photon in some @xmath17 events . in order to obtain",
    "corrected spectrum the matrix @xmath79 was constructed , where each @xmath79 is a probability to get a reconstructed @xmath24 value within the invariant mass bin @xmath39 for an simulated event with actual @xmath24 uniformly distributed in the bin @xmath42 .",
    "note , that in the two highest bins the simulated mass distribution were subdivided into smaller bins to take into account rapid decrease of the mass spectrum .",
    "the diagonal elements of the matrix and their immediate neighbors describe detector resolution .",
    "they turned out to be much larger than others which are due to misidentification of the recoil photon . using this matrix and the experimental mass spectrum the number of events with misidentification",
    "were estimated and subtracted from each bin .",
    "this procedure does not affect the diagonal elements of the matrix and their immediate neighbors but zeroes all others .",
    "after normalization to the total integrated luminosity and detection efficiency the differential branching ratios @xmath80 for both experiments were obtained .",
    "they are in a good agreement and thus can be combined together ( tabl.[t0 ] ) .",
    "using the matrix of efficiencies it is possible to restore the physical mass spectrum but such a procedure makes the values of corrected spectrum strongly correlated . to compare these results with model predictions one has to deal with a cumbersome covariance matrix . to simplify the analysis we instead transformed bare theory predictions @xmath81 using the values of efficiencies from table  [ t0 ] : @xmath82 here @xmath83 is a corrected for the detector response theoretical mass spectrum , which should be used for approximation of the experimental spectrum @xmath84 by the least squares method",
    "this approach is used in our fits , which are discussed in the next section .",
    "the @xmath20 invariant mass spectrum ( fig.[fig8 ] ) was approximated by the following function : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the contribution of the @xmath33 and @xmath87 decays , @xmath88 is the contribution of the process ( [ eq2 ] ) , and @xmath35 is an interference phase .",
    "this formula is exact only in case of identical angular distributions in @xmath57 and @xmath89 intermediate states .",
    "provided small @xmath89 contribution , the difference in the angular distributions for the @xmath17 final state can be approximately accounted for by fitting of @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath88 dependence was taken from @xcite .",
    "corresponding branching ratio is @xmath90 @xcite . for @xmath86",
    "the expression from ref.@xcite was used @xmath91 where @xmath92 is @xmath93 or @xmath94 inverse propagator , @xmath95 takes into account finite width corrections @xcite , @xmath96 is a complex parameter taking into account difference in coupling constants of @xmath93 and @xmath94 mesons .    in the kaon loop model of the @xmath97 transition",
    "@xcite @xmath98 is proportional to the product @xmath99 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath98 on @xmath100 in this model is different from the model with the point - like @xmath101 transition and can be interpreted as a form factor , which stops the @xmath98 growth at higher photon energies .",
    "the free parameters of the fit were @xmath35 , @xmath96 , @xmath102 , and coupling constants @xmath103 and @xmath104 while the width and mass of the @xmath94 meson were fixed at @xmath105 and @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath94 meson the breit - wigner propagator with @xmath107 and @xmath108 was used .",
    "the fitting result is @xmath109 , indicating that @xmath87 contribution is compatible with zero .",
    "this allows to reduce the number of free fitting parameters by fixing @xmath110 . for the remaining free parameters",
    "the following values were obtained : @xmath111 note , that although contribution from the process ( [ eq2 ] ) is small , and fitting with this contribution set to zero still gives high confidence level ( @xmath112 ) , but corresponding fitting curve ( fig.[fig8 ] ) shows visible systematic deviations from the observed mass spectrum .    the fitting results ( [ fits ] )",
    "demonstrate that the @xmath33 mechanism dominates in the decay ( [ eq0 ] ) , and contributions from @xmath87 and @xmath89 are small .",
    "neglecting these contributions and assuming natural isotopic ratio @xmath113 one can obtain from ( [ eq62 ] ) @xmath114 where the second errors are systematic which includes uncertainty in the interference terms .",
    "these errors were estimated by summation of systematic uncertainty from ( [ eq62 ] ) and the difference between ( [ eq86 ] ) and the value @xmath115 calculated from ( [ fits ] ) with @xmath87 and @xmath89 contributions taken into account .",
    "the @xmath93-meson width in the model @xcite is a rapid function of @xmath100 . at the resonance pole",
    "it is equal to @xmath116 . due to its close proximity to @xmath117 threshold",
    "this value is significantly larger than visible in fig.[fig8 ] @xmath93 width @xmath118 .",
    "note , that if the width corrections to the real part of @xmath93 propagator are set to zero the values of fitting parameters including @xmath93 mass and width change significantly : @xmath119 , @xmath120 , but such assumption looks much less attractive from the theoretical point of view .",
    "the model dependence of the @xmath93 mass and width explains disagreement between ( [ fits ] ) and some data from pdg @xcite .",
    "the model of ref.@xcite which takes into account the kaon loop contribution in the decay under study fits well the experimental spectrum . on the contrary ,",
    "it is not possible to describe the data using the model with point - like transition mechanism , in which the transition form factor is equal to unity and @xmath121 is proportional to @xmath122 , where @xmath26 is the photon energy . in this case",
    "the fitting curve does not follow the experimental spectrum and the @xmath123 ( fig.[fig8 ] ) .",
    "so , kaon loop contribution , which provides non point - like transition @xmath101 is confirmed by the our data .",
    "the values of coupling constants ( [ fits ] ) are in a good agreement with the 4-quark mit bag model predictions @xcite .",
    "new theoretical studies @xcite were performed after first observation in order to explain the data .",
    "it was shown that it is possible to describe experimental results using different theoretical approaches . in these models",
    "the 4-quark component exists directly or `` de facto '' as a result of the kaon loops contribution .",
    "results of this work confirming our first publications @xcite and cmd-2 measurements @xcite are based on the full snd data set which contains the largest statistics of @xmath17 events .",
    "the shape of the @xmath20 mass spectrum is described well by the sum of @xmath124 and @xmath33 contributions .",
    "the contribution of @xmath87 intermediate state is not required for description of the data but is not completely excluded by our data .",
    "it is shown that point - like transition model does not fit the experimental mass spectrum . at the same time , models with intermediate kaon loops reproduce the data . predictions of the four - quark mit bag model of the @xmath93 meson are in a good agreement with our results but we can not exclude other explanations .",
    "further theoretical studies and new data are needed to obtain consistent description of the @xmath4-meson quark structure and to detect @xmath87 contribution in the @xmath5 decay .",
