    "in earlier work ( robertson & leiter 2002 ) we extended analyses of magnetic propeller effects ( campana et al .",
    "1998 , zhang , yu & zhang 1998 ) of neutron stars ( ns ) in low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) to the domain of galactic black hole candidates ( gbhc ) . from the luminosities at the low / high spectral state transitions ,",
    "accurate rates of spin were found for ns and accurate quiescent luminosities were calculated for both ns and gbhc .",
    "ns magnetic moments were in agreement with those found for similarly spinning 200 - 600 hz pulsars .",
    "gbhc spins were found to be typically 10 - 50 hz .",
    "their magnetic moments of @xmath0 gauss @xmath1 are @xmath2 times larger than those of ` atoll ' class ns . in the magnetic propeller model",
    ", the inner disk radius , @xmath3 , determines the spectral state . very low to quiescent states",
    "correspond to an inner accretion disk radius outside the light cylinder .",
    "the inner disk radius lies between light cylinder and co - rotation radius in the low / hard / radio - loud / jet - producing state of the active propeller regime .",
    "the high / soft state corresponds to an inner disk inside the co - rotation radius and accreting matter impinging on the central object .",
    "we show here that this permits a quantitative accounting for the ` ultrasoft ' high state spectral peak and a high state hard x - ray spectral tail .",
    "a field in excess of @xmath4 g has been found at the base of the jets of grs 1915 + 105 ( gliozzi , bodo & ghisellini 1999 , vadawale , rao & chakrabarti 2001 ) .",
    "a recent study of optical polarization of cygnus x-1 in its low state ( gnedin et al .",
    "2003 ) has found a slow gbhc spin and a magnetic field of @xmath5 gauss at the location of its optical emission . given the @xmath6 dependence of field strength on magnetic moment , the implied magnetic moments are in good agreement with those we have found .",
    "although gnedin et al . attempted to explain the cygnus x-1 magnetic field as a result of a spinning charged black hole , the necessary charge of @xmath7 esu would not be stable . given the charge / mass ratios of electrons and protons , the opposing electric forces on them would then be at least @xmath8 times the gravitational attraction of @xmath9 .",
    "due to highly variable accretion rates , it is also unlikely that disk dynamos could produce the stability of fields needed to account for either spectral state switches or quiescent spin - down luminosities .",
    "both also require magnetic fields co - rotating with the central object .",
    "considering the magnetic moments to be intrinsic to the central object permits a physically obvious and unified explanation of lmxb radio and spectral states , but this is incompatible with the event horizons of black hole models of the gbhc .",
    "the success of the magnetic propeller model for gbhc and the lack of evidence for event horizons in gbhc ( abramowicz , kluzniak & lasota 2002 ) strongly suggests that it must be possible , within the confines of einstein s general relativity to accommodate intrinsic magnetic moments in gravitationally collapsed objects .",
    "this can be achieved if the energy momentum tensor on the right hand side of the einstein equation @xmath10 is chosen in a manner that dynamically enforces the strong principle of equivalence ( spoe ) requirement of ` timelike worldline completeness ' ; i.e. , the requirement that the worldlines of physical matter , under the influence of both gravitational and non - gravitational forces , must remain timelike in all of spacetime ( wheeler & ciuofolini 1995 ) .",
    "when this spoe condition is met , trapped surfaces leading to event horizons can not be dynamically formed and intrinsic magnetic moments can exist in gravitationally collapsing objects ( leiter & robertson 2003 , mitra 2000 , 2002 , see below ) .",
    "a relatively simple example of a collapsing , compact object that can dynamically obey the spoe requirement of ` timelike worldline completeness ' is that of a radiating plasma containing an equipartition magnetic dipole field that drives it to radiate at its eddington limit .",
    "such an object can be described to first order by the energy - momentum tensor : @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 describes outgoing radiation in a geometric optics approximation , @xmath14 is energy density of matter , @xmath15 is the pressure and @xmath16 the flux of photon radiation . for the collapsing mass ,",
    "we use a comoving interior metric given by @xmath17 and a non - singular exterior vaidya metric with outgoing radiation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the areal radius and @xmath20 is the retarded observer time . in order to maintain timelike worldline completeness as required by the spoe , the surface redshift must remain finite ( leiter & robertson 2003 , mitra 2000 , 2002 ) .",
    "then the proper time @xmath21 , at the collapsing , radiating surface , s , will be positive definite if @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the proper time rate of change of @xmath24 and @xmath25 with m(r , t ) the mass enclosed by the collapsing surface .    from equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) we see that in order to satisfy the requirement of timelike world line completeness for a collapsing object , for which @xmath26 , it is necessary to dynamically enforce the `",
    "no trapped surface condition ' , @xmath27 . in the meco model , this is accomplished by the non - gravitational force of outflowing radiation . at the comoving surface , the luminosity is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and the distantly observed luminosity is @xmath30 .    _ to guarantee the existence of sufficient internal radiation pressure , it is likely that a meco must possess an equipartition magnetic dipole field .",
    "_ at the temperatures and compactness of stellar collapse , a pair plasma exists within such a field .",
    "in addition to the intrinsic resistance to collapse of magnetic flux ( thorne 1965 ) , it has been shown ( pelletier & markowith 1998 ) that the energy of magnetic perturbations in equipartition pair plasmas is preferentially expended in photon production rather than causing particle acceleration .",
    "photon pressure varies @xmath31 , due to its dependence on pair density ( @xmath32 ) and synchrotron photon energy ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "lacking the pair plasma , the ratio of magnetic ( @xmath32 ) to gravitational stresses would be constant in a collapsing gas ( e.g. baumgarte & shapiro 2003 ) .",
    "with photon pressure capable of increasing more rapidly than gravitational stress , a secular equilibrium rate of collapse can be stabilized with the radiation temperature buffered near the pair production threshold .",
    "the stability of the rate of collapse is maintained by increased ( decreased ) photon pressure ( @xmath31 ) if the field is increased ( decreased ) by compression ( expansion ) . an equipartition field also easily confines the pair plasma .",
    "thus the collapse differs in a fundamental way from that of only weakly magnetic , radiation dominated polytropic gas or pressureless dust .",
    "strong recent evidence for equipartition magnetic fields in stellar collapse has been found for grb021206 ( coburn & boggs 2003 ) and strong residual fields much in excess of those expected from mere flux compression have been found in magnetars ( ibrahim , swank & parke 2003 ) .",
    "kluzniak and ruderman ( 1998 ) have described the generation of @xmath33 g magnetic fields for nuclear densities via differential rotation in neutron stars .",
    "other possibilities for producing extreme magnetic fields would include ferromagnetic phase transitions during the collapse ( haensel & bonnazzola 1996 ) or the formation of quark condensates ( tatsumi 2000 . )    since distantly observed magnetic fields are reduced by @xmath34 , a redshift of @xmath35 would be needed for the meco model with an equipartition field to accord with the magnetic moments we have found for gbhc , and also to account for agn luminosity constraints ( see the calculation for sgr a@xmath36 below ) .",
    "_ thus we are motivated by the spoe and empirical observational constraints to look for solutions of the gr field equations that are consistent with objects in extremely redshifted , eddington limited gravitational collapse . _",
    "the two key proper time differential equations that control the behavior of the surface of an eddington balanced , collapsing , radiating object are : ( hernandez jr . &",
    "misner 1966 , lindquist , schwartz & misner 1965 , misner 1965 ) : @xmath37 where @xmath38 includes magnetic field energy in @xmath15 and radiant energy in @xmath16 and @xmath39 in eddington limited steady collapse , the condition , @xmath40 , holds . with this condition , equation ( 8) , when integrated over the closed surface where the pressure is dominantly that of radiation , can be solved for the net outward flow of eddington limit luminosity through the surface . taking the escape cone factor of @xmath41 into account",
    ", the outflowing ( but not all escaping ) surface luminosity , l , would be @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the plasma opacity . for simplicity ,",
    "we have assumed here that the luminosity actually escapes from the meco surface rather than after conveyance through a meco pair photosphere .",
    "the end result is the same for distant observers .",
    "however the luminosity @xmath45 that appears in equations ( 8 - 9 ) is actually the net luminosity , which escapes through the photon sphere , and is given by @xmath46 thus in equations ( 8) and ( 9 ) , the @xmath45 appearing there is given by @xmath47 due to the thermal buffering provided by the equipartition field and pair plasma we can examine a limiting case for which meco mean proper density varies slowly enough that the condition @xmath48 also holds after a time , @xmath49 , that has elapsed in reaching the eddington limited state . in this context from ( 9 ) we have that @xmath50 which can be integrated to give @xmath51 for example , for hydrogen opacity , @xmath52 @xmath53/g , and @xmath54 , this yields a distantly observed meco lifetime of @xmath55 yr .",
    "the meco state for gbhc is likely preceded by a much faster gravitational collapse of a stellar core . with a neutrino opacity some @xmath56 times smaller than that of photons , the lifetime of eddington limited neutrino emissions would likely be minutes , at most .",
    "to stabilize the rate of collapse with magnetic pressure and synchrotron generated photons would require a photon luminosity reduced below the neutrino eddington luminosity by the same factor of @xmath57 , to a distantly observed @xmath58 erg / s .",
    "it is of interest to note that for this to correspond to a meco object radiating at its local eddington limit , a surface redshift of @xmath59 would be required , which accords with our earlier arguments based on empirical magnetic field observational constraints .",
    "distantly observed meco luminosity is diminished by @xmath60 by gravitational redshift and by @xmath61 by a narrow escape cone at the photosphere of a pair atmosphere . due to its negligible mass",
    ", we consider the pair atmosphere to be external to the meco .",
    "it can be shown _ ex post facto _ to be radiation dominated such that @xmath62 is constant throughout .",
    "estimates of luminosities , photosphere upper limit temperatures and photosphere redshifts can then be found from the eddington balance requirements .",
    "the fraction of luminosity from the meco surface that escapes to infinity in eddington balance is @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "the distantly observed luminosity is : @xmath65 by assuming that the escaping radiation is primarily thermal and that the photosphere temperature is @xmath66 , the fraction that escapes to be distantly observed is : @xmath67 where @xmath68 erg / s/@xmath53 and subscript p refers to conditions at the photosphere .",
    "equations ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) yield : @xmath69 to examine typical cases , a gbhc with @xmath70 and @xmath35 would have @xmath71 kev , a luminosity , excluding spin - down contributions , of @xmath72 , and a spectral peak at 220 a@xmath73 , in the photoelectrically absorbed deep uv . for an m=@xmath4 agn , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 with a spectral peak in the near infrared at 1.2 micron . _",
    "( sgr a@xmath36 , with @xmath76 , would have @xmath77 k and a 2.2 micron brightness of 6 mjy , just below the observational upper limit of 9 mjy ( reid et al .",
    "_ since @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 k , we find that @xmath81 for a gbhc with @xmath82 and @xmath83 , this yields a photosphere temperature of @xmath84 k , from which @xmath85 .",
    "an agn with @xmath86 would have a somewhat warmer photosphere at @xmath87 k , but with a red shift of @xmath88 .",
    "hence , although they are not black holes , passive meco without accretion disks would ( using any realistic opacity ) have lifetimes much greater than a hubble time and emit highly red shifted quiescent thermal spectra that may be quite difficult to observe .",
    "from the viewpoint of a distant observer , accretion would deliver mass - energy to the meco , which would then radiate most of it away . the contribution from the central meco alone",
    "would be @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the specific energy per particle available after accretion disk flow to the marginally stable orbit radius , @xmath91 . assuming that @xmath92 is some fraction , f , of the newtonian eddington limit mass accretion rate , @xmath93 , then @xmath94 where @xmath95 includes both quiescent and accretion contributions to the luminosity . due to the extremely strong dependence on temperature of the density of pairs , it is likely that the photosphere temperature remains near the previously found @xmath96 .",
    "then with @xmath83 , @xmath82 , and @xmath97 , we find @xmath98 k = 1.1 kev , and @xmath99 , which indicates considerable photospheric expansion . the meco luminosity would be @xmath100 erg / s , which is approximately at the newtonian eddington limit . for comparison , the accretion disk outside the marginally stable orbit at @xmath91 ( efficiency = 0.057 ) would produce only @xmath101 erg / s , with an inner disk temperature also ` ultrasoft ' at @xmath102 kev .",
    "most photons escaping the photon sphere would depart with some azimuthal momentum on spiral trajectories that would eventually take them across and through the accretion disk .",
    "thus a very large fraction of the soft photons would be subject to bulk comptonization in the plunging region inside @xmath91 .",
    "this contrasts sharply with the situation for neutron stars where there is no comparably large plunging region .",
    "this accounts for the fact that hard x - ray spectral tails are comparatively much stronger for high state gbhc .",
    "our preliminary calculations for photon trajectories randomly directed upon leaving the photon sphere indicate that this process would produce a power law component with photon index greater than 2 .",
    "it may be possible to detect meco in several ways .",
    "firstly , for a red shift of @xmath35 , the quiescent luminosity of a gbhc meco would be @xmath103 with @xmath104 kev .",
    "this thermal peak in the strongly absorbed uv might be observable for very nearby or high galactic latitude gbhc , such as a0620 - 00 or xte j1118 + 480 .",
    "secondly , at high state luminosities above @xmath105 erg / s , a central meco would be a bright , small ` ultrasoft ' central object that might be sharply eclipsed in deep dipping sources .",
    "thirdly , a pair plasma atmosphere in an equipartition magnetic field should be virtually transparent to photon polarizations perpendicular to the magnetic field lines .",
    "the x - rays from the central meco should exhibit some polarization that might be detectable .",
    "if gbhc meco are the offspring of massive star supernovae , then they should be found all over the galaxy .",
    "based upon our estimates of their quiescent temperatures , isolated gbhc meco would be weak , polarized , euv sources with a power - law tail in soft x - rays ."
