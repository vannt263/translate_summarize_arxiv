    "understanding the formation and evolution of our galaxy has always been one of the key quests in modern astrophysics for decades ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "since rrls are easily identifiable and they can provide a powerful means to probe the chemical compositions and dynamical properties of the old stellar populations , rrls in the galactic globular cluster ( gc ) systems or in the field are of particular importance to address the question of the early history of our galaxy ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . also , being a primary distance indicator , the distance to rrls can be accurately measured and rrls can help to yield important insights into the structure of our galaxy .",
    "recent studies by @xcite or @xcite are excellent examples of making use of rrls to understand the substructures in the galactic halo expected from the theory of the hierarchical structure formation , and to delineate the bar structure in the central part of our galaxy .    with the advent of large aperture telescopes , the utility of rrl will increase further in the future in order to learn more about the early buildup of our galaxy or nearby galaxies . for example",
    ", the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) will be capable of detecting rrls in the local group of galaxies out to @xmath14 1 mpc scale in several years of time span @xcite , providing us wonderful opportunities to investigate the substructures of not only the outer halo in our galaxy but also the nearby dwarf galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the future 30- to 40-m class telescopes will have the capability of detecting rrls in nearby groups of galaxies and the utility of rrls not only as a primary distance indicator but also as an old stellar population tracer will become more important .",
    "in doing so , we need to calibrate the absolute dimensions of physical parameters of rrls in our galaxy using well understood samples of rrls and then we can apply derived transformation relations of rrls , such as a period - luminosity - metallicity relation , to establish a cosmic distance scale .    in recent years , the fourier decomposition analysis of rrls has become very popular , since this method can provide an efficient means to investigate fundamental stellar parameters , such as metallicity , absolute magnitude , intrinsic color , temperature , etc ( see for example , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . the practical application of fourier parameters to characterize the rrls in our galaxy or in the large magellanic cloud appears to be successful , but some worrisome signs also started to emerge lately . in their study of rrls in the globular cluster m3",
    ", @xcite noticed that some fundamental physical parameters , such as the intrinsic color or the absolute visual magnitude , from fourier or pulsational parameters do not agree with the observed ones .",
    "naturally , both the intrinsic color and the absolute visual magnitude of rrls can affect the derived distance scale of rrls .",
    "the uncertainty in the intrinsic color of rrls can affect the foreground interstellar reddening value estimates and , subsequently , the distance scale of rrls under consideration will be affected too , although defining a proper color of rrls , especially that of rrab type variables with a large pulsational amplitude , is not a trivial task ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "achieving an accuracy of a 0.1 mag level for the absolute magnitude of rrls is non - trivial and has been a difficult task for decades @xcite .",
    "putting aside the discontinuity in the metallicity - luminosity relation of rrls , @xmath15 = @xmath16 + @xmath17[fe / h ] , between the oosterhoff i and ii gcs seen in our galaxy @xcite , the zero - point @xmath16 in the above relation is poorly determined and is a major source of uncertainties in the distance measurement based on rrls . note that an uncertainty of 0.1 mag in the absolute magnitude results in a @xmath14 5% error in the distance measurement .",
    "the recent results from the absolute trigonometric parallaxes of the five nearby rrls using fine guidance sensor ( fgs ) on hubble space telescope ( hst ) prefer a brighter absolute visual magnitude level of rrl than those previously known , with @xmath15 = 0.45 @xmath4 0.05 at [ fe / h ] = @xmath81.50 dex @xmath14 @xmath81.6 dex , xz cyg , uv oct and rr lyr correspond to the oosterhoff group",
    "i while rz cep and su dra correspond to the oosterhoff group ii . ]",
    "@xcite , which is 0.07 mag brighter than those from others , i.e.  @xmath15 = 0.52 mag at [ fe / h ] = @xmath81.5 dex ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "hence , if the recent measurement by @xcite are true , the previous calibrations from the fourier parameters or the theoretical horizontal - branch ( hb ) models based on the fainter absolute visual magnitude of rrl are in error .",
    "it would be very desirable to re - calibrate the zero - point in old transformation relations and to set up new distance scale of rrls .",
    "it is expected that the zero - point of the absolute visual magnitude and the accuracy of the measurement will be dramatically improved with gaia during the next decade ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is the first of a series of papers addressing the distance scale from rrls . in this paper",
    ", we present a high precision @xmath0 ccd photometry of rrls in ngc  6723 .",
    "our main goal is to study the rrl population in ngc  6723 and scrutinize the distance scale from rrls of the cluster by employing various methods . in section 2",
    ", we address the interesting aspects of the metal - rich inner halo gc ngc  6723 . in section 3 , data acquisition and data reductions",
    "are discussed , including our photometric calibration and the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "section 4 describes the methods of period searching and the methods of searching for new variables . in section 5 ,",
    "we discuss the fundamental physical properties of rrls from fourier and pulsational parameters .",
    "in particular , we discuss the distance scale from rrls in detail and we derive the new zero - point correction terms for the absolute visual magnitude of rrls . in section 6",
    ", we show a relation between the degree of photometric contamination of rrls and the apparent crowdedness of the gc systems . in the appendix",
    ", we discuss the evolutionary effect and the photometric contamination , such as blending , on the three rrls in ngc  6723 , v14 , v15 and v16 .",
    "we also show that two @xmath18 sct variable stars and five w uma type eclipsing binaries are off - cluster field stars based on the distance from the center of ngc  6723 and the true distance from the sun .",
    "ngc  6723 is an old metal - rich gc located @xmath14 2.6 kpc from the galactic center @xcite .",
    "it has long been thought that ngc  6723 is a genuine galactic bulge gc owing to its rather high metallicity and its proximity to the galactic center . for example , @xcite claimed that ngc  6723 is on a circular orbit about the galactic center and it is a true resident of the central region of the galaxy .",
    "however , by employing the absolute proper motion study of the cluster , @xcite showed that ngc  6723 has a highly inclined polar orbit .",
    "they suggested that the kinematics of ngc  6723 is more likely that of a halo object and is not likely a member of the rotationally supported system , although the bulge / disk / halo decomposition is not a trivial task in the central region of our galaxy .",
    "nevertheless , several aspects still make ngc  6723 a very interesting metal - rich inner halo gc in investigating the formation of the galactic inner halo : ( i ) it is",
    "metal - rich ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath191.2 ) and its metallicity is similar to ( or slightly more metal - poor than ) the mean metallicity of rrls in the baade s window @xcite .",
    "( ii ) it is very old @xcite .",
    "( iii ) it is rich in the rrl population @xcite .",
    "( iv ) it suffers only small amount of foreground interstellar reddening , @xmath9  = 0.05 mag @xcite and , therefore , is very suitable to investigate photometric parameters of rrls .",
    "( v ) since ngc  6723 has been confined in the galactic bulge ( or the inner halo ) region and never left the bulge ( or the inner halo ) due to lower total kinetic energy @xcite , ngc  6723 can play a role as the gc counterpart for the numerous field inner halo rrls in baade s window .",
    "therefore , one may infer the formation epoch of the inner halo rrls from that of ngc  6723 , whose rrls share common physical properties as the inner halo rrls .    in spite of its importance",
    ", only a few studies have been done for the cluster .",
    "@xcite studied the variable star population in ngc  6723 and he presented @xmath0 light curves for 29 rrls .",
    "he suggested that ngc  6723 has a heavily populated blue hb .",
    "@xcite also found that ngc  6723 has a rather blue hb morphology , @xmath20 = @xmath80.08 @xmath4 0.08 , leading them to conclude that ngc  6723 is a very old gc .",
    "@xcite carried out a homogenous @xmath21 photometry study of 34 gcs .",
    "they measured the magnitude difference between the turn - off ( to ) and hb , @xmath22 , and reached the same conclusion that ngc  6723 is one the oldest gcs in our galaxy .",
    "various studies by others @xcite using the model isochrone fitting method , for example , also showed that ngc  6723 has a very old age .",
    "the previous metallicity measurements of ngc  6723 suggest that the metallicity of the cluster ranges from [ fe / h ]  @xmath14 @xmath80.7 to @xmath14 @xmath81.4 .",
    "smith ( 1981 and references therein ) measured the metallicity of ngc  6723 using the @xmath23 method of five rrls and he obtained [ fe / h ]  @xmath14 @xmath80.7 on butler s abundance scale .",
    "@xcite derived [ fe / h ]  = @xmath81.09 from the cmd morphology and the q39 integrated light index .",
    "later , @xcite obtained [ fe / h ]  = @xmath81.14 from the ddo photometry system and @xcite obtained [ fe / h ]  = @xmath81.35 from the washington photometry system .",
    "later , @xcite performed a high resolution spectroscopic study of three red - giant branch ( rgb ) stars and they obtained [ fe / h ]  = @xmath81.26 @xmath4 0.09 for ngc  6723 .",
    "they also found that ngc  6723 appears to have enhanced @xmath24-elemental abundances , consistent with its old age .",
    "@xcite measured the metallicity of the cluster using the ca  ii triplet lines of the rgb stars in near infrared passband and they obtained [ fe / h ]  = @xmath81.12 @xmath4 0.07 on the zinn & west s abundance scale and @xmath80.96 @xmath4 0.04 on the carretta & gratton s abundance scale @xcite .",
    "our observations of the cluster were made with seven runs ( 29 nights in total ) spanning nearly ten years , from august 2002 to july 2012 , using the ctio 0.9 m and the ctio 1.0 m telescopes .",
    "the journal of observations is presented in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "also shown in the table are the number of observations per filter and per night .",

    "we used the ctio 1.0 m telescope for three runs in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 .",
    "the typical exposure times for the cluster were 300 s for johnson @xmath27-band and 200 s for @xmath28-band filters for most runs . in total , we collected 383 frames in @xmath27 and 401 frames in @xmath28 .",
    "the raw data were processed using the standard iraf packages .",
    "the raw image frames were trimmed and bias - corrected . for 2002 and 2004 seasons ,",
    "dome and sky flat images were applied to remove pixel to pixel variations and illumination corrections using sky flats were applied to eliminate the large scale structure . for other seasons , only sky flat images were applied .    since both telescopes are equipped with an iris type shutter ,",
    "the illumination across the ccd chips is not uniform and the shutter shading correction is non - trivial especially for short exposures .",
    "therefore , we applied the shutter shading correction for science frames with less than 10 s exposure time . during the 2002 season",
    ", we obtained the series of dome flats with the exposure times of 1 s and 60 s using the ctio 0.9 m telescope .",
    "we normalized these two sets of dome flats and then we calculated the residual in the 60 s dome flats in the time unit and calculated shutter delay time across the ccd chip . the exposure time with the ctio 0.9 m telescope is @xmath14 70 ms longer in the center than the upper - left or lower - right corners of the ccd chip and the shutter delay time is not uniform across the chip .",
    "for the ctio 1.0 m telescope , we also obtained shutter delay time correction images in each of three individual seasons .",
    "the shutter delay time for the ctio 1.0 m telescope is slightly shorter than that of the ctio 0.9 m telescope .",
    "the exposure time with the ctio 1.0 m telescope is @xmath14 50 ms longer at the center of the ccd chip .",
    "we also found that the shutter delay time for the ctio 1.0 m telescope does not appear to have any temporal variations .    during august 2002 , may 2004 and july 2012 seasons , we observed 26 , 35 and 36 photometric standard stars from @xcite .",
    "we selected stars with a wide range of colors and magnitudes .",
    "all standard frames were analyzed using the photometry task in daophotii , daogrow and ccdstd @xcite . in order to derive the transformation relations from the instrumental system to the standard system , we adopt the following equations : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the airmass and @xmath28 , @xmath27 and ( @xmath31 ) are the magnitudes and color on the standard system . in figure",
    "[ fig : landolt ] , we show the residuals of @xmath28 and ( @xmath31 ) in the sense @xcite minus our measurements and we show our transformation coefficients and residuals in @xmath28 magnitude and @xmath32 color in table  [ tab : coeff ] .",
    "point - spread function ( psf ) photometry for all ngc  6723 science frames was performed using daophotii - allstar , allframe , collect - ccdave - newtrial packages @xcite . to achieve good psfs on individual science frames",
    ", we used about 100 to 250 isolated bright stars , depending on the seeing conditions and exposure times , and at least three iterations were required to remove neighboring stars from our psf stars . for the psf calculation , we adopted a quadratically variable psf for most cases .",
    "the total number of stars measured from our allframe run was more than 31,000 and our final cmd is shown in figure  [ fig : cmd ] .    finally , astrometric solutions for individual stars in our field have been derived using the positional data extracted from the naval observatory merged astrometric dataset ( nomad , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we achieved rms scatter in the residuals of 0.05 arcsec using the iraf imcoors package .",
    "then the astrometric fit was applied to calculate the equatorial coordinates for all stars measured in our science frames .    in figures [ fig : menzies ] , [ fig : alvarado ] and [ fig : pbs ] , we show comparisons of our results with the photoelectric photometry data of @xcite and @xcite and the ccd photometry data of @xcite . as can be seen in the figures ,",
    "our photometry is in excellent agreement with previous measurements by others .",
    "@xcite and @xcite list 32 variables in ngc  6723 : 29 rrls , two red variables and one @xmath33 variable .",
    "we used the finding charts provided by @xcite to identify those variables .",
    "then we used his periods to estimate the photometric phases for our list of new standard @xmath28 and @xmath27 magnitudes and heliocentric julian day ( hjd ) , and drew light curves for each variable star .",
    "for all variables , the light curves showed phase shifts in their maxima or minima indicating that period adjustments were needed .",
    "therefore , we determined new ephemerides and periods for the 29 previously known rrls . to determine the periods , we used three methods : the string - length method @xcite , the phase dispersion minimization method @xcite , and the information entropy minimization method @xcite . in all cases ,",

    "it should be noted that the results derived from fourier parameters presented in section [ s : fc ] are for @xmath39  and @xmath40 .",
    "since the energy generated by nuclear reaction inside the variable star is unaffected by the pulsation of the variable star , the @xmath40  should be the same as would be observed were the star not pulsating @xcite .",
    "it is known that the @xmath39  gives the closest approximation to the color - temperature relation of the `` equivalent static star '' @xcite .",
    "however , a caution should be advised on the average color of rrls , in particular that of rrab type variable stars with large pulsational amplitude .",
    "as noted by @xcite , either @xmath39  or @xmath41   ( and @xmath42 ) do not represent the correct temperature measure for the rrls due to excess emission in the @xmath27 passband during the rise from minimum to maximum radius . in figure",

    "the differences in color between different color systems are very small , @xmath44 0.01 mag , for rrc type variable stars with symmetric sinusoidal light curves",
    ". however , the difference in color can be as large as 0.07 mag for rrab type variable stars with asymmetric light curves with large @xmath43 values .",
    "figure  [ fig : compbv ] ( b ) and ( d ) suggest that the difference in the color of rrls is closely correlated with the blue amplitude @xmath43 , in the sense that as the blue amplitude increases the discrepancy between different color systems increases .",
    "recent ccd photometry surveys of gcs reveal many new variables , especially rrls with low amplitudes or in the crowded central part of gcs and we attempt to search for new variables in ngc  6723 following the method similar to @xcite .",
    "we collected psf magnitudes for about 460 variable candidates returned from newtrial based on the variability index and calculated magnitude variations as a function of the hjd .",
    "we then calculated light curves of each variable candidate with the best estimated period .",
    "we employed the information entropy minimization method with an 8@xmath268 grid size and the string - length method for this purpose .",
    "visual examinations of plots of magnitude variations against the hjd and the phase - folded light curves for all variable candidate stars revealed 22 new variables ; 14 rrls , one sx phe type and two @xmath18 scuti type variable stars and five w uma type eclipsing binaries .",
    "we also  rediscovered \" all 29 previously known rrls .",
    "positions and photometric parameters for new variables are presented in table  [ tab : rrlyrae ] and light curves for the new variables are shown in figure  [ fig : newrrlc ] . as expected , most of the newly found variables lie near the central part of the cluster .",
    "identification charts for the new variables are presented in figures  [ fig : chart1 ] and [ fig : chart2 ] for the outer ( with a field of view of 15 @xmath26 15 arcmin ) and inner part ( 4 @xmath26 4 arcmin ) of the cluster , respectively .",
    "we also marked the previously known rrls in the figures .",
    "note that all new rrls lie within the tidal radius of ngc  6723 .    in an attempt to confirm the membership of the new rrls",
    ", we examined the cmd near the hb region ( see figure  [ fig : cmdhb ] ) and the period - amplitude diagram ( see figure  [ fig : pvsa_b ] ) , since there is no previous proper motion study or radial velocity measurements are available for the new variables .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : cmdhb ] , the rrc type variable nv1 appears to be too bright to be a regular rrc type variable star of ngc  6723 .",
    "the average intensity - weighted integrated magnitude @xmath40of the remaining seven rrc type variables including nv7 and nv11 is 15.480 @xmath4 0.019 mag and nv1 is 0.748 mag brighter than the mean magnitude .",
    "however , it should be noted that nv1 is located within the core radius of the cluster and its photometric metallicity , [ fe / h ] = @xmath81.28 dex , from the fourier analysis presented in section  [ s : feh ] is consistent with the mean metallicity of the cluster , [ fe / h ] @xmath14 @xmath81.2 dex .    it is suspected that nv1 may be a member of a binary system .",
    "we attempted to find out the secondary periodicity for nv1 using pre - whitened data but we failed to get any reliable secondary period of the variable .",
    "since it lies about 36 arcsec from the center of the cluster , it may suffer from blending effect with nearby bright stars .",
    "we visually examined the point - spread function of nv1 in individual science frames and found no sign of blending .",
    "we also found no evidence of blending for nv1 from the images taken with the hst advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) by @xcite which were retrieved via the mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) , leading us to believe that nv1 is most likely a non - member of the cluster and is most likely a foreground rrc type variable .",
    "however , follow - up monitoring of nv1 in the future would be desirable to reveal the potential binary nature of nv1 .",
    "the rrab type variable nv14 is slightly fainter and redder than the rest of rrab type variables of the cluster .",

    "other physical parameters of nv14 , such as metallicity , derived from the fourier analysis do not disagree with those from other variable stars .",
    "this leads us to believe that nv14 is a cluster member with an excess differential foreground reddening effect by @xmath45 0.03 mag .    in appendix , we present the membership status of other types of new variable stars in ngc  6723 .",
    "the sx phe type variable star nv19 is most likely a cluster member star while the two @xmath18 sct type variable stars , nv16 and nv18 , and the five w uma type eclipsing binaries nv15 , nv17 , nv20 , nv21 and nv22 do not appear to be cluster members , based on the radial distance from the center of the cluster and the true distance modulus .    with the discovery of new variables , the new mean periods of rrab and rrc variables are @xmath1p@xmath2@xmath3 = 0.541 @xmath4 0.066 day ( 35 stars ) and @xmath1p@xmath5@xmath3 = 0.292 @xmath4 0.030 day ( 7 stars without nv1 ) , respectively .",
