    "fast quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in the x - ray brightness of neutron - star and black - hole x - ray binaries provide a useful probe into the inner accretion flows around such compact objects . since the original discovery of @xmath1  hz qpos in the luminous neutron - star binary gx  5@xmath21 ( van der klis et al . 1985 ) , a variety of additional qpos as well as broad noise components have been observed with properties that depend on the spectral state of the sources ( see van der klis 1995 , 1998 for reviews ) .",
    "the z sources , which are luminous neutron - star low - mass x - ray binaries ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) , typically show four distinct types of qpos . in current nomenclature , these are the @xmath3  hz normal branch oscillation ( nbo ) , the @xmath4  hz horizontal branch oscillation ( hbo ; see van der klis 1989 for a review of these low frequency qpos ) , and the @xmath5  hz kilohertz qpos that typically occur in pairs ( van der klis et al .",
    "the atoll sources , which are less luminous neutron - star low - mass x - ray binaries , typically show @xmath6  hz kilohertz qpos that occur in pairs ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 ) , as well as @xmath7  hz qpos and broad noise components that have been identified as possibly similar to horizontal branch oscillations ( see , e.g. , hasinger & van der klis 1989 ; homan et al .",
    "all of these qpos have centroid frequencies that increase with inferred mass accretion rate . in several atoll sources ,",
    "nearly coherent @xmath8  hz oscillations have also been detected during thermonuclear type  i x - ray bursts ( see , e.g. , strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the phenomenology of qpos in black - hole x - ray binaries has not been developed to the same extent so far .",
    "several low - frequency ( @xmath9  hz ) qpos have been detected with frequencies that depend on inferred mass accretion rate ( see , e.g. , chen , swank , & taam 1997 ; morgan , remillard , & greiner 1997 ) , as well as three cases of qpos with higher frequencies , two of which may or may not be constant ( @xmath10  hz in grs  1915@xmath11105 : morgan , remillard , & greiner 1997 ; @xmath12  hz in gro  1655@xmath240 : remillard et al . 1999a ;",

    "broad noise components are also prominent in the power - density spectra of black - hole x - ray binaries and show many similarities with those of neutron - star sources ( van der klis 1994a , 1994b ; wijnands & van der klis 1999 ) .",
    "a large variety of theoretical models have been proposed for the different qpos in neutron - star and black - hole systems .",
    "the rms amplitudes of almost all qpos increase with increasing photon energy up to @xmath14  kev and their frequencies usually depend strongly on mass accretion rate ( see , however , jonker , van der klis , & wijnands 1999 ) . for these and other reasons ,",
    "such qpos are thought to originate close to the compact objects and their frequencies have been identified with various characteristic frequencies in the inner accretion flows .",
    "for example , theoretical models attribute some of the observed qpos to keplerian orbital frequencies in the disk ( e.g. , alpar et al . 1992 ; miller , lamb , & psaltis 1998 ) , to the beat of such frequencies with the stellar spin ( e.g. , alpar & shaham 1985 ; lamb et al .",
    "1985 ; miller et al .",
    "1998 ) , to radiation - hydrodynamic ( fortner , lamb , & miller 1989 ; klein et al . 1996 ) or oscillatory disk and stellar modes ( e.g. , nowak & wagoner 1991 ; bildsten & cutler 1995 ; kanetake , takauti , & fukue 1995 ; alpar & yilmaz 1998 ; titarchuk , lapidus , & muslimov 1998 ) , to general relativistic effects ( ipser 1996 ; stella & vietri 1998 , 1999 ) , etc .",
    "some of these models depend explicitly on the existence of a hard surface or a large - scale magnetic field and therefore are valid only for qpos in neutron - star systems , whereas others are applicable only to black - hole systems or to both .",
    "the detection of several qpos at the same time in a single source provides multiple probes to the inner accretion flow around the compact object .",
    "such a simultaneous detection is often attributed to actions of distinct mechanisms affecting the x - ray brightness of the source simultaneously in different ways , whereas in other models all qpos correspond to different modes of the same fundamental mechanism ( e.g. , titarchuk & muslimov 1997 ) .",
    "when several types of qpo are observed in the x - ray brightness of a system simultaneously , their frequencies , which commonly increase with mass accretion rate , are often tightly correlated ( see , e.g. , van der klis et al .",
    "1996 ; ford & van der klis 1998 ; psaltis et al .  1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "in some cases , these correlations appear to depend only weakly on the other properties of the sources .",
    "for example , the frequencies of the upper and lower khz qpos , as well as the frequencies of the upper khz qpo and the hbo are consistent with following very similar relations in all z sources ( psaltis et al.1998 , 1999 ) .    here",
    "we study the systematics of qpos and peaked broad noise components observed in non - pulsing neutron - star and black - hole low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "we find tight correlations among them .",
    "in particular , we find an indication that two types of variability , showing up in some systems as an hbo and a khz qpo , may occur , at widely different coherences and over a wide range of frequencies , in both neutron - star and black - hole systems .",
    "we caution , however , that the striking correlations we report here might be an artifact produced by the accidental line - up of multiple , independent correlations .",
    "if future observation confirm our results , this will strongly constrain theoretical models of qpos in neutron - star and black - hole systems .",
    "quasi - periodic oscillations and peaked broad noise components have been detected in both neutron star and black hole systems . in this section",
    "we discuss observations of such systems in which at least one qpo has been detected together with one more peaked variability component , and attempt to identify the various power - spectral components with qpos and noise components in other sources on the basis of , primarily , their frequencies .",
    "we restrict our study to phenomena with frequencies @xmath15  hz to avoid the very complicated timing behavior of the microquasars at these low frequencies ( see , e.g. , remillard et al .",
    ". we do not consider in our study the peculiar @xmath16  hz qpo in the dipper 4u  1323@xmath262 ( jonker et al .",
    "1999 ) that has properties very different compared to all other qpos in non - pulsing neutron - star sources .",
    "we will also exclude from our study qpos observed in accretion powered pulsars , most of which are thought to be strongly magnetic ( @xmath17  g ) and hence to have different inner accretion flow properties than the non - pulsing neutron star sources .",
    "the qpo and noise properties in the only known millisecond accretion powered pulsar , sax  j1808.4 - 3658 , have been compared to those of the non - pulsing sources by wijnands & van der klis ( 1999 ) and are also excluded in the present study .      _",
    "z sources._in the power spectra of z sources , the identification of qpos and noise components is unambiguous .",
    "for example , four distinct qpo peaks that are not harmonically related are often observed simultaneously in sco  x-1 ( van der klis et al .",
    "1996 ) . in this as well as the other z sources ,",
    "these qpo peaks are identified as nbos , hbos , or khz qpos , based on their frequencies and occurrence in different spectral branches .",
    "figure  1 shows a power - density spectrum of sco  x-1 ( based on the data described in van der klis et al .",
    "1997 ) , in which an hbo and its harmonic , as well as a lower and an upper khz qpo are evident ( notice that frequency shifts were applied to the power spectra shown in fig.1 ) . in the five z sources in which hbos have been observed simultaneously with two khz qpos , the frequency of the hbo is tightly correlated to the frequency of the upper khz qpo ( wijnands et al.1998a , 1998b ; homan et al .",
    "1998 ; see also stella & vietri 1997 ; psaltis et al .",
    "1999 ) . at the same time , the frequencies of the lower and upper khz qpos are also tightly correlated , in a way that is well described by a simple empirical power - law relation ( psaltis et al .",
    "both correlations are consistent with being very similar in all z sources . in sco x-1 , which is the only z source that simultaneously shows nbos and khz qpos , the frequencies of these qpos are",
    "also tightly correlated ( van der klis et al .",
    "1997 ) . here , in discussing the qpos detected in z sources , we shall use _ rxte _ data that have been previously published ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the upper khz qpo , hbo , and nbo frequencies detected in the above z sources are plotted in figure  2 against the lower khz qpo frequency ( red points ) . the hbo frequency @xmath18 appears to be well correlated to the frequency of the lower khz qpo @xmath19 , as expected given their previously known common dependence on the frequency of the upper khz qpo .",
    "when @xmath20  hz , the data points for the z sources are consistent with the empirical relation @xmath21  hz@xmath22  hz@xmath23 , in which the normalization constant depends on the peak separation of the khz qpos , which is very similar between sources ( compare psaltis et al .  1998 , 1999 ;",
    "when @xmath24  hz , @xmath18 increases slower with @xmath19 ) .",
    "figure  2 shows this relation ( dashed line ) , extrapolated by more than two orders of magnitude towards lower frequencies .",
    "_ atoll sources._in most atoll sources in which qpos have been detected , khz qpos can be easily identified when at high frequencies , because of these high frequencies and their common occurrence in pairs . however , when their frequencies become low , the coherence of the qpo decreases and confusion becomes more likely , especially with other @xmath25  hz components of the power spectra ( ford & van der klis 1998 ) . as in the case of the z sources , the frequencies of simultaneously detected lower and upper khz qpos are tightly correlated .",
    "they are consistent with following empirical power - law relations similar to the one followed by the z sources ( psaltis et al.1998 ) . here",
    ", we shall use khz qpo data for atoll    sources that have been obtained by _ rxte _ and have been previously published ( see table  1 ) .",
    "figure  2 shows the upper khz qpo frequencies detected in atoll sources plotted against the lower khz qpo frequencies ( blue points near the top of the graph ) .",
    "single qpos at frequencies @xmath26  hz have occasionally been detected in some atoll sources simultaneously with the khz qpos ( here we use the _ rxte _ data on 4u  1820@xmath230 : smale , zhang , & white 1997 ; ks  1731@xmath226 : wijnands , & van der klis 1997 ; 4u  1608@xmath252 : mndez et al . 1999 ; 4u  1728@xmath234 : ford & van der klis 1998 ; and 4u  1702@xmath2429 : markwardt , strohmayer , & swank 1999a ; see also table  1 ) .",

    "however , we stress here that this identification is very tentative .",

    "1997 ) ; and gs  2023@xmath11338 ( oosterbroek et al .",
    "these qpos are often accompanied by a power - spectral break at lower frequencies . in some cases ( e.g. , gs  1124@xmath2683 and gs  2023@xmath11338 ) , broad components at frequencies higher than the frequency of the qpo",
    "are also seen ; however , the properties and frequencies of these features have not been reported and therefore can not be used in the present study .",
    "figure  2 shows the frequencies of the various types of variability components detected in z and atoll sources as well as in several other neutron - star systems and in a number of black - hole binaries , as a function of either the frequency of the lower khz qpo or the broad noise component that we tentatively identify as such .",
    "the previously discussed correlations ( psaltis et al.1998 , 1999 ) between the frequencies of the upper and lower khz qpos in z and atoll sources as well as between the frequencies of the hbo and the khz qpos in z sources are evident . moreover , figure  2 shows that remarkably tight correlations exist between these frequencies in the other low - mass x - ray binaries , as well .    in particular",
    ", there is one correlation extending over nearly three orders of magnitude in frequency that appears to depend very little on the properties of the compact objects and apparently encompasses the hbo and lower khz qpo observed in z and atoll sources , the @xmath71  hz qpo and @xmath28  hz noise component in cir  x-1 , as well as the @xmath72  hz qpo and @xmath31  hz noise component in other neutron - star and black - hole systems .",
    "this relation is consistent with the data points of 4u  1820@xmath230 , 4u  1735@xmath244 , cir  x-1 , 1e  1724@xmath23045 , gro  0422@xmath1132 , and xte  j1550 @xmath2564 but statistically only marginally consistent with the data points of 4u  1728@xmath234 , gs  1826@xmath236 , grs  1915@xmath11105 , and gx  339@xmath24 .",
    "the latter does not necessarily imply that the relation is not consistent with the true frequencies of these components in the last four sources , as the low coherence of the broad noise components ( @xmath73 is of order unity in these sources ) implies that systematic effects such as continuum subtraction , which we have not taken into account in our error estimates , dominate the uncertainties in the measurement of the centroid frequencies .",
    "in addition to the hbo and the upper khz qpo , the nbo frequencies of sco  x-1 are also correlated to the frequency of the lower khz qpo ( van der klis 1997 ) .",
    "further structure is visible in figure  2 in between the hbo and nbo correlations , consisting mostly of qpos observed in 4u  1728@xmath234 , 4u  1608@xmath252 , xte  j1550@xmath2564 , and gro  1655@xmath240 .",
    "these qpos may represent the subharmonics of the hbo or demonstrate the existence of a different type of qpo ( see ford & van der klis 1998 for a discussion ) .",
    "of course , we could always hypothesize that there are two types of lower khz qpos .",
    "note here that the very flat correlation between the hbo and khz qpo frequencies seen in sco  x-1 ( see psaltis et al .",
    "1999 ) may be due to a transition from one branch to the other , as figure  2 suggests .",
    "figure  2 also suggests some other qpo identifications that have not been previously made .",
    "we studied the various types of qpos and broad noise components observed in neutron - star and black - hole x - ray binaries .",
    "we found that among the frequencies of these various type of variability components it is possible to find two that are tightly correlated in a way that seems to depend only weakly on the other properties of the sources , such as the mass , magnetic field , or possibly the presence of a hard surface in the compact object .",
    "such correlations suggest that similar physical mechanisms may be responsible for some qpos and noise components , which can be found over wide ranges of frequencies and coherences , in z , atoll , and possibly even black - hole sources .",
    "figure  2 shows these correlations and includes observations of neutron - star and black - hole sources in which a qpo ( with frequency @xmath15  hz ) has been detected simultaneously with at least one more variability component , either broad - band noise or qpo , and for which we could obtain reliable frequency estimates .",
    "there exist other observations of the same and related sources , where no variability component , or only one , of the types discussed here is detected .",
    "it is not clear what determines the number and type of detectable variability components in a given source and at a given spectral state .",
    "however , it appears that when the variability components we have identified above are detected in a source , their frequencies follow one of a small number of correlations shown in figure  2 .",
    "in particular , we find indications that the low - frequency ( @xmath74  hz ) qpos observed in some atoll sources , in cir  x-1 and other neutron - star sources , as well as possibly in some black - hole sources may be the same phenomenon as the hbo observed in z sources .",
    "moreover , we suggest that the broad noise components at frequencies @xmath75  hz observed in cir  x-1 , some neutron - star star sources , and possibly in some black - hole sources may be the same phenomenon as the lower khz qpos observed in z and atoll sources .",
    "we caution here that the identification of broad noise components in some sources with narrow qpos in others relies so far entirely on the tight correlations between their frequencies shown in figure  2 .",
    "no transition from a narrow qpo peak to a broad noise component has been observed so far in a single source .",
    "note , however , that the relative widths of the variability components identified here as the lower khz qpo increase systematically with decreasing centroid frequency when different sources are compared : @xmath76 in the @xmath77  hz lower khz qpos in z and atoll sources , @xmath78 in the @xmath79  hz broad noise component in cir  x-1 , and @xmath80 in the @xmath31  hz broad noise components in the black - hole sources . in sco  x-1 ,",
    "the relative width of the lower khz qpo also increases systematically with decreasing qpo frequency , in a way that is consistent with the decrease of coherence between sources discussed above .",
    "detection of a transition from a narrow khz qpo to a broad , lower frequency noise component would give more weight to the conjecture put forward here .",
    "on the other hand , detection of one or two narrow khz qpos together with the broad - band noise components at lower frequencies that follows the tight correlation shown in figure  2 will reject our hypothesis .",
    "if confirmed , the detection of hbos and lower khz qpos over a wide range of frequencies in neutron - star systems will pose strong constraints on theoretical models for their nature .",
    "a successful model must be able to explain the presence of the same type of variability in sources with significantly different mass accretion rates , with values for the frequencies and coherences that span over two orders of magnitude .",
    "figure  2 gives a hint that hbos and lower khz qpos may have been detected in some black - hole candidates .",
    "detailed analysis of the properties of these qpos and further comparison between the power spectra of neutron - star and black - hole sources are required to test such a conjecture .",
    "confirmation of the identification of the same type of qpo in both neutron - star and black - hole sources will challenge models of such qpos that depend on the existence of a hard surface or of an ordered magnetic field around the compact object .",
