    "the mass - profile model @xmath196 is then described by @xmath197 parameters ( see section  [ subsubsec : likelihood ] ) .",
    "additionally , we have seven calibration parameters ( @xmath198 ) to marginalize over ( section  [ subsubsec : prior ] ) . the projected cumulative mass profile @xmath114 is given by integrating the density profile @xmath123 ( see also appendix [ appendix : estimators ] ) as @xmath199    the results are shown in figure [ fig : mass ] .",
    "first , we use only the weak - lensing distortion and depletion constraints for our joint likelihood analysis ( @xmath200 , @xmath201 ; @xmath202 , @xmath203 , @xmath204 ) , corresponding to the weak - lensing analysis of @xcite . from this",
    ", we find a consistent mass - profile solution @xmath123 ( green circles ) with an integrated s / n of @xmath205 .",
    "the ml solution has a reduced @xmath206 of @xmath207 for 5 degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "next , the mass - profile solution from our full - lensing constraints is shown in figure [ fig : mass ] with red squares ( @xmath208 ) .",
    "it is demonstrated that , when the strong - lensing information is included , the central weak - lensing bin @xmath209 is resolved into @xmath210 radial bins , hence improving the determination of the inner mass profile .",
    "the s / n ratio in the recovered mass profile is @xmath211 , which is consistent within uncertainties with the total s / n obtained from the linearly - combined full - lensing constraints , @xmath212 .",
    "we find here a minor statistical improvement from adding the blue source counts , because the positive magnification - bias effect is only marginally detected in our analysis ( @xmath213 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : wldata ] we also display the joint bayesian reconstruction of each observed radial profile , ensuring consistency and reliability of our lensing analysis and methods .",
    "in this paper we have developed a non - parametric bayesian method for a direct reconstruction of the projected cluster mass profile from a multi - probe cluster lensing analysis ( section  [ subsec : bayesian ] ) , combining independent strong - lensing , weak - lensing shear and magnification measurements .",
    "this multi - probe approach improves the accuracy and precision of the cluster lens reconstruction , effectively breaking the mass - sheet degeneracy ( section  [ subsec : sheet ] ) .",
    "this work extends our earlier work by @xcite to include multiple populations of background sources for magnification - bias measurements ( sections  [ subsec : magbias ] and [ subsec : relmagbias ] ) and enclosed total mass estimates in the central strong - lensing region ( section  [ subsec : sl ] ) .",
    "this flexible method applies to both the strong- and weak - lensing regimes for full radial coverage ( section  [ sec : app ] ) .",
    "magnification bias depends on the intrinsic properties of the source luminosity function as well as the source distance , in contrast to the purely - geometric color - independent distortion effects .",
    "the combination of count measurements for distinct blue and red background populations probes a wider range of levels of magnification bias ( section  [ subsec : relmagbias ] ) , boosting the significance of cluster lensing measurements ( section  [ sec : app ] ) .",
    "furthermore , combining spatially - uncorrelated distinct populations of background galaxies will help reduce the reconstruction bias due to their intrinsic angular clustering @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note that , unlike the shearing effect , magnification is in principle sensitive to the sheet - like structure ( section  [ subsec : sheet ] ) , so that making accurate magnification measurements is crucial for a robust statistical detection of the _ two - halo term _ contribution due to large - scale structure associated with the central clusters @xcite .    adding strong - lensing information to weak - lensing is needed to provide tighter constraints on the inner density profile @xcite .",
    "the full mass profile constraints on individual clusters , derived from a joint weak+strong lensing analysis , can be further stacked together to increase the statistical precision of the average mass profile determination .",
    "recently @xcite performed a comprehensive stacked lensing analysis of four similar mass clusters @xcite , by combining weak - lensing derived @xmath60 profiles with their respective inner @xmath60 profiles derived independently from detailed strong - lens modeling .",
    "in contrast , the new method developed here allows us to construct a joint weak+strong lensing likelihood function of the underlying @xmath10 signal , by explicitly combining weak - lensing measurements with strong - lensing enclosed mass estimates @xmath114 , a more fundamental observable than @xmath60 in the strong - lensing analysis @xcite .",
    "therefore , our new approach permits a direct error propagation and thus a more accurate derivation of the reconstruction covariance matrix @xmath126 .",
    "when combining strong and weak lensing constraints in different regimes of signal strength and significance , it is crucial to account for possible systematic errors introduced by inherent modeling and prior assumptions , especially for strong - lens modeling due to complex , nonlinear error propagation .",
    "recently , @xcite introduced a regularization technique to obtain robust , conservative error estimates for the binned mass profile derived from strong lensing , by calibrating the covariance matrix to eliminate very small eigenvalues associated with large - scale modes where the constraints are weak and essentially driven by the prior .",
    "it is straightforward to extend our joint likelihood analysis to include in equation ( [ eq : lsl ] ) the covariance between radial bins .",
    "an accurate determination of the cluster density profile for full radial coverage is crucial for testing dm and alternative - gravity paradigms @xcite .",
    "@xcite explored in detail an extremely - light bosonic dark - matter ( elbdm ) model with a mass of the order @xmath214ev , as an alternative to cdm to account for the perceived lack of small galaxies relative to the @xmath1cdm model @xcite .",
    "elbdm with a de - broglie wavelength of astronomical length scales , if it exists , may well be in a ground - state bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) and hence described by a coherent wave function , behaving effectively as a single scalar field @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , @xcite showed that , elbdm halos can form steepening density profiles of the form similar to the standard cdm , irrespective of whether halos form through accretion or merger .",
    "however , during a collision between becs interesting large - scale interference occurs which will differ markedly from the behavior of cluster galaxies and standard collisionless cdm .",
    "therefore , it is important to explore this class of dm further via more extensive simulations for providing testable predictions against detailed cluster lensing observations of both relaxed and merging clusters .    the clash survey @xcite is particularly designed to generate such useful lensing data , combining high - resolution 16-band _ hst _ imaging with wide - field subaru observations , for a sizable sample of 20 x - ray selected ( @xmath215kev ) relaxed clusters @xcite , free of lensing - selection bias , and a lensing - selected sample of five high - magnification clusters",
    ", the majority of which are physically - interacting merging systems @xcitemedezinski+2013 .",
    "a stacked analysis of the x - ray selected clash clusters ( with a halo bias factor of @xmath216 ) , combining all lensing - related effects in the cluster regime , is highly desirable for a definitive determination of the representative mass profile out to beyond the virial radius , where the two - halo term is expected to be detectable in the averaged @xmath10 profile @xcite , providing a firm basis for a detailed comparison with the standard @xmath1cdm paradigm and a wider examination of alternative scenarios @xcite .",

    "the distant blue population of background galaxies has a distinct , well - defined redshift distribution , which is fairly symmetric and peaked at a mean redshift of @xmath253 @xcite , so that the majority of faint blue galaxies are in the far background of typical cluster lenses , and that the lensing signal has a weaker dependence on the source redshift .",

    "<S> lens magnification by galaxy clusters induces characteristic spatial variations in the number counts of background sources , amplifying their observed fluxes and expanding the area of sky , the net effect of which , known as magnification bias , depends on the intrinsic faint - end slope of the source luminosity function . </S>",
