    "mean - field theories are widely used to analyze a large variety of many - body systems for which the independent particle picture can be applied . in nuclear physics , mean - field approaches",
    "generally lead to satisfactory results for bulk properties of atomic nuclei , such as their masses , radii and ground - state deformations .",
    "however , in some cases improvements beyond the mean - field treatment are definitely needed .",
    "for instance , mean - field models do not predict accurately the single - particle spectra ( i.e. energies , spectroscopic factors and fragmentations of single - particle states ) , especially close to the fermi energy . a possibility for improvement",
    "is given by introducing the coupling between individual nucleon degrees of freedom and collective degrees of freedom .",
    "phenomenological skyrme forces have been used widely and successfully for non - relativistic nuclear structure calculations of medium - mass and heavy nuclei @xcite . in effect",
    "such purely phenomenological two - body interactions can be viewed as to provide a convenient parameterization of the nuclear energy density functional on which the self - consistent mean - field treatment ( in the form of solving the kohn - sham equations ) can be based . in order to go beyond the common mean - field ( hartree - fock ) approximation , second - order calculations with the phenomenological skyrme force",
    "have been pursued in recent works by moghrabi , grasso et al.@xcite .",
    "these exploratory studies have been concerned with the second - order contributions to the equation of state of infinite isospin - symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter . since the ( two - body )",
    "skyrme interaction is of zero range , divergences occur at second order in many - body perturbation theory , which have been treated either by cutoff regularization @xcite or by dimensional regularization @xcite .",
    "it has been concluded in refs.@xcite that after readjusting the parameters of the skyrme interaction a simultaneous good reproduction of the equation of state of isospin - symmetric and isospin - asymmetric nuclear matter can be achieved at second order .",
    "however , a closer inspection of the published expressions for the second - order contributions in ref.@xcite raises doubts about their completeness and correctness .",
    "the first deficit is the omission of a second - order contribution from the spin - orbit term proportional to @xmath5 .",
    "this @xmath1-wave interaction term averages to zero in infinite matter at first order , but not at second order ( see e.g. appendix a in ref.@xcite for the second - order contributions from a `` boson - exchange '' spin - orbit interaction ) .",
    "secondly , the stated expressions @xcite for the energy per particle of isospin - symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter include interference terms between @xmath0-wave and @xmath1-wave components of the skyrme interaction ( i.e. terms proportional to @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "it is very questionable how such a mixing of different parities could be induced by the ( homogeneous ) nuclear medium .",
    "moreover , the expressions for the cutoff - independent second - order contributions given in a later paper @xcite by the same authors disagree partly with those published in ref.@xcite .",
    "these apparent inconsistencies provide good reason to reconsider and extend the calculation of the skyrme interaction to second order in nuclear matter .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , the skyrme force is introduced as a galilei - invariant two - nucleon contact - interaction in momentum space . on this basis , first - order hartree - fock results are rederived for a variety of density - dependent nuclear matter quantities , such as the energy per particle and the ( isospin and spin ) asymmetry energy .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the second - order calculation in many - body perturbation theory .",
    "we employ a scheme where the in - medium ( particle - hole ) propagator is decomposed into the vacuum propagator and a medium - insertion .",
    "this scheme has the advantage that ultraviolet divergences appear only in the second - order hartree and fock diagrams with two medium - insertions .",
    "the pertinent one - loop rescattering in vacuum is treated by dimensional regularization and shown to vanish identically . as a consequence",
    "the genuine second - order terms arise entirely from the hartree and fock diagrams with three medium - insertions .",
    "the occurring finite integrals over three fermi spheres can be solved analytically and the results for the nuclear matter quantities consist of even powers of the fermi momentum @xmath8 multiplied with products of the skyrme parameters and a numerical coefficient of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is some rational number .",
    "it is found that the energy per particle of isospin - symmetric nuclear matter @xmath11 and pure neutron matter @xmath12 do not include any @xmath0-wave and @xmath1-wave interference terms at second order .",
    "however , such @xmath13-interference terms show up in the ( isospin and spin ) asymmetry energies . the reason and condition for @xmath13-mixing to emerge is explained in appendix a by considering the in - medium loop for a proton - neutron pair in nuclear matter with unequal proton and neutron densities . in section 4 , the effective nucleon mass and the isotropic fermi - liquid parameters",
    "are calculated up to second order .",
    "these results allow for a rigorous check through the validity of several landau relations @xcite . in section 5 ,",
    "the effects of tensor interactions at second order are computed .",
    "actually , with the inclusion of two independent tensor terms the skyrme force gets completed to the most general two - nucleon contact - interaction quadratic in momenta . in section 6 ,",
    "the iteration of the skyrme force with the one - photon exchange is considered .",
    "this mechanism generates a charge - symmetry breaking contribution to the energy density of protons , which could help to resolve the nolen - schiffer anomaly @xcite .",
    "this anomaly refers to the observation that the binding energy differences of mirror nuclei can not be explained by the coulomb interaction of the protons alone .",
    "remarkably , one finds an infrared - finite result for the energy per proton @xmath14 even though a regulator photon mass @xmath15 has be introduced initially .",
    "section 7 deals with some provisional parameter fits .",
    "it is found that with nine adjustable parameters in the complete second - order expression , one does not obtain a good reproduction of a realistic nuclear matter saturation curve in the low - density region @xmath2 .",
    "the reason for this failure lies in the too strong density - dependence @xmath3 of several second - order contributions . from this observation",
    "one can conclude that the inclusion of ( ad hoc ) density - dependent terms is indispensable for a realistic description of nuclear matter in the skyrme approach . at a formal level ,",
    "these are taken into account by performing appropriate parameter substitutions , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , in all first- and second - order expressions derived in this work .",
    "let us clarify that the main purpose of this paper is to compile the ( correct ) analytical expressions for various nuclear matter quantities as they arise from a second - order calculation with a two - body contact - interaction of the skyrme type .",
    "the question of whether improvements are possible in comparison to a first - order mean - field approach has to be explored in future studies .",
    "this section serves mostly for orientation .",
    "we introduce various density - dependent nuclear matter quantities and specify their first - order hartree - fock contributions .",
    "the skyrme interaction is a zero - range two - nucleon contact - interaction with transition matrix - element in momentum - space : @xmath18 here , @xmath19 is the spin - exchange operator and @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote half of the momentum difference in the initial and final state , respectively .",
    "this particular form of @xmath22 , involving only external momentum differences , is dictated by galilei invariance ( and invariance under time - reversal : @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) .",
    "the individual terms in eq.(1 ) stand for : @xmath0-wave contact interaction ( @xmath25 ) , @xmath0-wave effective range correction ( @xmath26 ) , @xmath1-wave contact interaction ( @xmath27 ) , and spin - orbit interaction ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the general contact - potential up to order @xmath28 , as it is commonly used in chiral effective field theory @xcite , has two additional tensor terms which will be studied separately in section 5 .",
    "note that we have not explicitly written in eq.(1 ) the density - dependent skyrme term @xmath29 .",
    "formally , it can be included through the substitution of parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 in all following formulas .",
    "however , from a rigorous point of view such density - dependent couplings will lead to a conflict with basic many - body relations ( landau relations @xcite and hugenholtz - van - howe theorem @xcite ) , whenever derivatives with respect to density @xmath32 are involved .    .",

    "the fermi momentum @xmath8 is related the ( total ) nucleon density in the usual way , @xmath35 . performing the appropriate spin- and isospin - traces and integrals over two fermi spheres , one obtains for the energy per particle of isospin - symmetric nuclear matter the well - known first - order expression : @xmath36\\bigg\\ } \\,.\\ ] ] in the same way , but leaving out the isospin - trace ,",

    "this guarantees the spin - stability of nuclear matter by excluding a phase transition to a ferromagnetic state of lower energy density .",

    "the reason behind this connection is an equi- valent form of the contact - interaction which results from @xmath22 in eq.(1 ) through the substitutions : @xmath57 with @xmath58 the isospin - exchange operator .",
    "the known eigenvalues of @xmath59 and @xmath60 are @xmath61 and @xmath62 with @xmath63 the total spin and isospin quantum numbers .",
    "since the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 act only in @xmath0-wave states with @xmath64 , one has effectively for @xmath0-waves the equality @xmath65 .",
    "likewise , the parameter @xmath27 acts only in @xmath1-wave states with @xmath66 and therefore for @xmath1-waves the opposite equality @xmath67 holds .",
    "another obvious consequence of the equivalent interaction is that only the combinations @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 can contribute in neutron matter , since @xmath71 for a two - neutron state .",
    "this is exemplified by calculating the first - order contribution to the spin asymmetry energy of pure neutron matter : @xmath72\\bigg\\ } \\,.\\ ] ] again , the density - dependent quantity @xmath73 must be positive : @xmath74 , in order to prevent neutron matter from a ferromagnetic instability at low and moderate densities .",
    "we conclude this section by giving the contributions from the relativistically improved kinetic energy : @xmath75 @xmath76 where @xmath77mev denotes the average nucleon mass .",
    "in this section we derive analytical expressions for the contributions to the introduced nuclear matter quantities as they arise from a second - order calculation with the skyrme interaction @xmath22 . at second order in many - body perturbation theory the energy density",
    "is represented by closed three - loop hartree and fock diagrams with either two or three medium - insertions .",
    "the first set involves the rescattering of two nucleons in the vacuum ( i.e. without pauli blocking corrections ) . for the contact - interaction @xmath22",
    "this one - loop diagram leads to principal - value integrals of the form : @xmath78 with @xmath79 , where @xmath80 are two external momenta inside the fermi sphere @xmath81 .",
    "the first factor in eq.(14 ) is the energy denominator and the other factors in curly brackets come from the galilei - invariant contact - interaction . after angular integration and partial fraction decomposition of the radial integrand one",
    "gets power divergences of the form @xmath82 , which are set to zero in dimensional regularization . the remaining convergent principal - value integral @xmath83 vanishes identically .",
    "as a side remark we note that cutoff regularization would provide additional terms @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 proportional to odd powers of the cutoff @xmath87 . for the first two the @xmath87-dependence could be absorbed into the coupling constants @xmath88 and @xmath89 , while the last one would require the introduction of a four - derivative contact - interaction .",
    "in dimensional regularization ( or after renormalization ) one is therefore left with the hartree and fock diagrams with three medium - insertions shown in the lower part of fig.1 .",
    "these lead to ( finite ) principal - value integrals over three fermi spheres of the form : @xmath90 with @xmath91 .",

    "the upper boundary for the @xmath97-integration is then @xmath98 , with the directional cosine @xmath99 . by applying this procedure to evaluate the nine - dimensional principal - value integrals ,",
    "one is able to obtain analytical results for all second - order contributions .",
    "let us also note that for @xmath0-wave interactions @xmath100 the hartree and fock diagram contribute with opposite sign , whereas for @xmath1-wave interactions @xmath101 the hartree and fock diagram contribute with equal sign .",
    "putting all pieces together one ends up with the following expression for the second - order contribution from @xmath22 to the energy per particle of isospin symmetric nuclear matter : @xmath102 the first important observation one can make is that there are no interference terms between @xmath0-wave and @xmath1-wave components of the skyrme interaction @xmath22 .",
    "a detailed comparison to the expressions written in eqs.(16,17 ) of ref.@xcite reveals that therein only the term proportional to @xmath103 is correct .",

    "it be should noted that ref.@xcite did not use the advantageous scheme of expanding in the number of medium - insertions and therefore divergent integrals of the form eq.(14 ) as well as finite integrals of the form eq.(15 ) had to be continued together to @xmath105 space - dimensions .",
    "moreover , the galilei - invariant formulation of the interaction @xmath22 in momentum - space is important .    by adding half of the ( previous ) hartree contribution to the fock contribution one arrives at the energy per particle of pure neutron matter : @xmath106 as expected from the consideration of the equivalent interaction in section 2 , the second - order result @xmath107 involves only the parameter combinations @xmath108 and @xmath70 .",
    "the corresponding expression given in ref.@xcite is correct only with respect to the term proportional to @xmath109 , and the ( simplest ) term proportional @xmath110 misses a factor @xmath111 therein .",

    "the second - order contribution to the isospin asymmetry energy @xmath44 is more difficult to calculate .",

    "it is considerably stiffer than the realistic equation of state ( represented by the dashed line in fig.4 ) as evidenced by the high value @xmath241mev of the nuclear matter incompressibility .",
    "while the shape of the full line in fig.4 can be considered as acceptable , there is serious problem behind it , namely the unrealistically low value of effective nucleon mass @xmath242 , which is completely determined by the parameter @xmath243 .",

    "an inspection of the full line in fig.5 reveals that a good reproduction of the realistic nuclear matter saturation curve can not be obtained .",

    "the resulting equation of state is shown by the dashed - dotted line in fig.5 and one observes that its shape remains almost unchanged in comparison to the free fit .",
    "the values for the isospin asymmetry energy @xmath259mev and the spin asymmetry energy @xmath260mev have changed a bit .    from these findings",
    "one can conclude that the inclusion of the ( ad hoc ) density - dependent term @xmath261 is indispensable for a realistic description of nuclear matter in the skyrme approach .",
    "formally , this extra term is taken into account by making the parameter substitutions : @xmath16 and @xmath262 , in all first- and second - order expressions .",
    "we have convinced ourselves that after this extension a good reproduction of the realistic nuclear matter saturation curve is possible at second order .",
    "this is in agreement with the findings of refs.@xcite , where however incorrect expressions have been used for the second - order contributions .",
    "certainly , the fitting of parameters of the skyrme interaction @xmath263 , when treated to second order , should go beyond the mere saturation curve and include as constraints all possible available properties of nuclear matter .",
    "such a comprehensive analysis goes beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "but the analytical calculations of a large variety of nuclear matter properties to first and second order as performed in this work lay the foundation for such a future study .    .",
    "the ( ad hoc ) density - dependent term @xmath264 is left out . ]",
    "in this appendix we analyze under which conditions a mixing between @xmath0-wave and @xmath1-wave components of the two - body interaction ( with different parity ) can occur in a fermionic medium .",
    "the two diagrams in fig.6 represent the in - medium loop for an interacting proton - neutron pair in nuclear matter .",
    "the short double - line symbolizes the medium - insertion ( i.e. the pauli - blocking effect ) for the neutron on the left side and for the proton on the right side . if the lower and upper contact - vertex are of @xmath0-wave type and @xmath1-wave type , respectively , the real part of the in - medium loop is given by a principal - value integral of the form : @xmath265 where @xmath266 denote the fermi momenta of neutrons and protons , and @xmath267 are exponents of @xmath268 .",
    "the expression in the second line follows by substituting @xmath269 in the second summand .",
    "it makes evident that @xmath13-mixing can occur only in a medium with unequal neutron and proton densities , @xmath270 . for small isospin asymmetries",
    "@xmath113 the available phase - space becomes a ( thin ) spherical shell of thickness @xmath271 .",
    "the net result for the in - medium loop with @xmath13-mixing , expanded to linear order in @xmath113 , is given in the third line of eq.(58 ) and it involves the logarithmic functions : @xmath272 where @xmath273 and @xmath274 are two dimensionless variables .",
    "in fact , the same asymmetric configuration as considered above is present in the calculation of the isospin ( or spin ) asymmetry energy from the second - order hartree and fock diagrams .",
    "this explains why @xmath13-interference terms proportional to @xmath6 and @xmath7 do occur in the expressions @xmath275 , @xmath276 and @xmath277 written in eqs.(18,19,21 ) . in the case of the energy per particle , @xmath11 or @xmath12 ,",
    "one has from the outset just one single fermi momentum , @xmath8 or @xmath38 , and therefore @xmath13-mixing terms can not emerge for these quantities at second order in many - body perturbation theory .",
    "in this appendix we derive the first - order fock and second - order hartree and fock contributions as they arise from several long - range interaction potentials .",
    "the energy per particle and asymmetry energies are calculated for many - fermion systems with either four or two internal degrees of freedom ( e.g. isospin - symmetric nuclear matter or pure neutron matter ) .",
    "our first candidate is an interaction potential in coordinate - space with an inverse square and an inverse fourth - power dependence on the particle - distance : @xmath278 where the parameter @xmath279 is a length and @xmath280 is a volume .",
    "the calculation of interaction contributions in the fermionic medium requires the fourier - transform of this long - range potential : @xmath281 where @xmath282 is the galilei - invariant momentum transfer . taking @xmath283 as an interaction - vertex in momentum - space , the evaluation of the first - order fock diagram and the second - order hartree and fock diagrams in fig.1 gives for the four - component system ( nuclear matter ) : @xmath284 @xmath285 where @xmath286 denotes the catalan number .",
    "note that @xmath287 always results from the @xmath215-loop integral belonging to the second - order fock diagram with two medium - insertions .",
    "the analogous calculation in the two - component system ( pure neutron matter ) gives the following contributions to the energy per particle and the spin asymmetry energy : @xmath288 @xmath289 it is worth to mention that the ( singular ) @xmath279-interaction provides an infrared - finite result at second order .",
    "ultraviolet divergences have been treated in dimensional regularization , using the rule : @xmath290 .",
    "note that the contributions of second - order hartree diagrams ( with two or three medium insertions ) are in nuclear matter a factor @xmath111 larger than in pure neutron matter .",
    "the corresponding pieces carry ( besides a rational number ) the coefficients @xmath291 and @xmath292 .    as a second example for a long - range interaction we treat the familiar van - der - waals potential : @xmath293 where the factor @xmath294 has been introduced in order to get a simpler fourier - transform .",
    "the many - body calculation at first and second order with the cubic interaction - vertex @xmath295 leads to the following results for the four - component system : @xmath296 @xmath297 and for the two - component system : @xmath298 @xmath299 the expressions in the second lines of eqs.(67 - 70 ) stem from the interference terms of the van - der - waals interaction @xmath300 with the ( more long - range ) @xmath279- and @xmath280-interactions .",
    "finally , one notices that all interaction contributions derived here are in the form of even powers of the fermi momentum , @xmath8 or @xmath38 .",
    "it is expected that the analytical results compiled in this appendix could be useful for certain condensed matter systems .",
