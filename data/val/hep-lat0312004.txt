    "one of the central goals of nuclear physics is to make rigorous predictions for both elastic and inelastic processes in multi - nucleon systems directly from qcd .",
    "the only presently - available technique to achieve this goal is lattice qcd , where space - time is discretized and qcd green functions are evaluated in euclidean space .",
    "unfortunately , at present , the variety of processes that can be addressed with lattice qcd is quite limited .",
    "the currently - available computational power restricts not only the sizes of lattices that can be utilized , but also the lattice spacings and quark masses that can be simulated .",
    "moreover , the maiani - testa theorem  @xcite precludes determination of scattering amplitudes away from kinematic thresholds from euclidean - space green functions at infinite volume .",
    "however , by generalizing a result from non - relativistic quantum mechanics  @xcite to quantum field theory , lscher  @xcite realized that one can access @xmath0 scattering amplitudes from lattice simulations performed at finite volume .",
    "significant progress has been made using this finite - volume technique to determine the low - energy @xmath1 phase shifts directly from qcd , e.g. ref .",
    "however , only one lattice qcd calculation of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) scattering lengths  @xcite has been attempted , and it was a quenched simulation with heavy pions  .",
    "when contemplating computing nuclear observables with lattice qcd one naively assumes that the lattice must be much larger than the systems being simulated , so that the systems on the lattice resemble those at infinite - volume .",
    "this would mean , for instance , that when computing the rate for the simplest inelastic nuclear process , @xmath2 , which near threshold involves radiative capture from the @xmath3 channel , a lattice of size @xmath4 is required , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the @xmath3 and @xmath7 nn scattering lengths , respectively . given",
    "that @xmath8 , such a calculation would have to await a future in which computational power is sufficient to handle volumes of this size .",
    "fortunately , as we will see , this argument is not correct .",
    "there is a sizable separation of length scales in nuclear physics , due to the fact that nature has chosen to be very near an infrared fixed point of qcd  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the scattering lengths in both @xmath9wave channels are unnaturally - large compared to all typical strong - interaction length scales , including the range of the nuclear potential which is determined by the pion compton wavelength .",
    "perhaps counter - intuitively , in simulating two - nucleon processes , the relevant lengths scales are those of the nuclear potential and _ not _ the scattering lengths , and thus as long as the lattice is large compared to the inverse of the pion mass one can in principle `` simply '' determine matrix elements and scattering parameters .",
    "furthermore , quantitative information about the two - nucleon sector can be extracted from simulations on even smaller lattices .",
    "however , the theoretical analysis that would be required for such an extraction is significantly more complex , and in this work we restrict ourselves to lattices that are much larger than the pion compton wavelength  .",
    "perhaps the motivation for a lattice calculation of the radiative - capture process @xmath10 is less than compelling as the cross - section and contributing multipoles at low - energies are well - measured .",
    "high - precision data recently collected  @xcite with hi@xmath11s agrees well with calculations  @xcite in the pionless effective field theory  @xcite , @xmath12 , and also with the best modern potential models ( see ref .",
    "however , weak processes such as @xmath13 , which play a central role in the determination of solar - neutrino fluxes from the sun , depend upon two - body weak currents  @xcite that presently are determined with significant uncertainties from reactor experiments  @xcite and are also determined from the @xmath14-decay of tritium  @xcite with unknown systematic uncertainties .",
    "recently they have been determined by the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) from a fit to the neutrino fluxes  @xcite , but again with large uncertainty .",
    "as we move into an era of high - precision neutrino astronomy , and considering the potential impact this will have on our understanding of particle physics , it is imperative that we have a precision determination of these weak currents",
    ". lattice qcd may be the only rigorous method with which to determine these capture rates with high precision unless a precise experimental determination is made  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we explore the scattering states and bound states of the two - nucleon sector at finite lattice volumes .",
    "we first develop the finite - volume effective field theory relevant to the very - low energy interactions of two - nucleons , and we recover the exact eigenvalue equation as well as several approximate formulas due to lscher  @xcite .",
    "we find several new approximate formulas ; we derive the leading finite - volume corrections to the bound - state energy and we find perturbative formulas for the lowest - lying energy levels for the case of a scattering length which is large compared to the lattice size .",
    "armed with this technology , we consider simple unphysical limits of the scattering parameters to gain some intuition , and then explore the two - nucleon sector itself .",
    "an effective field theory ( eft ) without pions , @xmath12 , has been developed  @xcite to describe the very low - momentum interactions of two nucleons , with and without electroweak probes .",
    "@xmath12 exploits the sizable hierarchy between the @xmath9wave nn scattering lengths on the one hand , and the effective ranges , shape parameters and pion compton wavelength on the other , and has been used successfully to perform relatively high - precision calculations , some at the @xmath15 level .",
    "therefore , an eft exists that can be used to rigorously determine the behavior of low - momentum nuclear observables in a finite volume , i.e. a lattice , and conversely can be used to extract infinite - volume limits of lattice simulations of two - nucleon observables .",
    "furthermore , @xmath12 has been used to successfully compute the properties of three - nucleon systems  @xcite , and therefore calculations of three - nucleon systems at finite volume should be possible as well  .    for nn scattering ,",
    "the interaction between nucleons is described by a series of local operators with an increasing number of derivatives acting on the nucleon fields .",
    "the scattering amplitude can be computed in an elegant form using dimensional - regularization with power - divergence subtraction ( pds )  @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "the coefficients of the operators in the lagrange density have natural size , even for unnaturally - large scattering lengths .",
    "the scattering amplitude is identical to that of effective - range theory , and that found by solving the schrdinger equation with a pseudo - potential  @xcite .",
    "an important feature that distinguishes @xmath12 from other constructions is that electroweak interactions can included systematically , in the same way they are included in chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath16pt ) .    in @xmath12",

    "the loop integral @xmath24 is linearly divergent , and when defined with the pds subtraction scheme  @xcite becomes @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the momentum of each nucleon in the center - of - mass , and hence the scattering amplitude takes the usual form @xmath27 this unitary expression describes nn scattering below the onset of the first inelastic threshold ; that is , it is valid for @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the pion mass .",

    "we may therefore adopt the effective - range expansion , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the scattering length , @xmath37 is the effective range , and the other @xmath38 correspond to higher - order shape parameters  .",
    "we are interested in the energy - eigenvalues of the nn system placed in a box with sides of length @xmath39 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the scattering - state and bound - state energy - eigenvalues can be found by requiring the real part of the inverse scattering amplitude computed in the box to vanish , @xmath40 where the infinite - volume integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fullsum ] ) is replaced by a discrete sum over the momentum states allowed on the lattice , @xmath41 this discrete sum is also linearly divergent as the ultra - violet behavior of the theory is unchanged , and its value in the pds scheme is found by adding and subtracting the corresponding infinite - volume integrals evaluated at @xmath42 .",

    "one might imagine that the potential is extremely attractive and that the state with @xmath92 is the one near threshold with many other deep states present . however , the deep states will be at the cut - off of the theory , set by the range of the potential , and in the limit we are considering these are infinitely deep . the system with @xmath93 could result from a repulsive interaction in which case there will be no bound state in this channel .",

    "the scattering lengths of opposite signs can be identified with each other ( as this is equivalent to taking the @xmath95 limit of the model ) and so the levels become degenerate . one is tempted to think that the levels that are degenerate in the @xmath94 limit are the same as those that are degenerate in the @xmath96 limit . however",
