    "angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) is an important tool to study electron dynamics , as within the sudden approximation it probes the energy and momentum of the low - energy excitation spectrum of an @xmath0 particle system . in the non - interacting picture , this spectral function would be a delta function at the precise energy and momentum given by the band structure . when interactions are turned on , the peak in the spectral function shifts in energy and momentum and gains a finite width that is dependent on the energy and momentum of the excitation .",
    "the lineshape gives direct access to the lifetime of the excitation and can provide insight into the nature of the underlying interactions .",
    "in general , many standard methods used to calculate lifetimes of excitations in correlated systems have starting points which do not allow the inclusion of a full momentum dependent self - energy ; they are inherently spatially local descriptions .",
    "therefore , experimental access to lineshapes via a momentum resolved spectroscopy is of great interest .",
    "this is particularly the case for exotic materials such as the cuprates and manganites , where the strong anisotropy of the elementary excitations might require a description in terms of an explicitly @xmath1 dependent self - energy .    in general",
    ", the shape of measured peaks in an arpes spectrum does not correspond directly to the excitation s intrinsic lineshape .",
    "this is due to the finite response function , or resolution of the arpes spectrometer , and possibly also to additional complications from sample surfaces and final state lifetime contributions . to determine the intrinsic lineshape ,",
    "all possible effects must be carefully considered when interpreting the experimental spectra .",
    "therefore , the study of model systems , where these effects can be controlled and accounted for , is an important test before lineshape information can be reliably obtained for other more exotic systems .    in this paper",
    "we examine in detail whether arpes can extract quantitative lineshape information for a model fermi liquid ( fl ) system to unambiguously verify the key predictions of the fl description of a correlated material .",
    "the most direct means of testing whether a material is a fl is to determine whether there is a discontinuity in the momentum distribution function @xmath2 .",
    "the experimental determination of a discontinuity is fundamentally limited , and may be further complicated in this case by matrix element effects@xcite",
    ". however , there are a number of directly related signatures that can be tested . for a fl , luttinger s counting theorem states that the volume inside the fermi surface ( fs ) should be maintained when the interactions are turned on.@xcite furthermore , if the interactions are not momentum dependent , then the shape of the fs of the correlated material should still be well described by non - interacting calculations.@xcite both of these signatures can be directly tested for by arpes .    beyond the volume and shape of the fs",
    ", fl theory requires that elementary excitations ",
    "the so called quasiparticles  close to the fermi energy have a width that is narrower than their binding energy .",
    "this requirement comes directly from the restricted phase space for low energy scattering processes , and without which the discontinuity in @xmath2 will not occur . for a 3 dimensional ( 3d ) spherical fs",
    "the linewidth is expected to decrease to zero like @xmath3 as the fermi energy is approached.@xcite for a 2 dimensional ( 2d ) cylindrical fs , the dominant term becomes @xmath4.@xcite the linewidth , and the @xmath5 dependence of the linewidth can , in principle , be measured by arpes .",
    "tite@xmath6 , a correlated material , has been presented in the literature as providing the main example to date of arpes spectra showing lineshapes well matched by fl theory ( see refs . , , and references within ) .",
    "however , linewidths in this material have been found to be substantially wider than their binding energy .",
    "this discrepancy has been explained by the 3d nature of tite@xmath6 .",
    "the anisotropy in the resistivity between the @xmath7 plane and the @xmath8 direction is only about 40 , a small enough difference for electronic dispersion in the @xmath8 direction to be non - negligible . with a finite dispersion in the @xmath8 direction , broadening of the arpes peaks",
    "occurs , including significant final state lifetime effects.@xcite as there is no independent measurement of the @xmath8 direction dispersion or the photoelectron lifetime in tite@xmath6 , the size of these contributions to the overall peak width is not well understood .",
    "arpes data from a model fl system would also allow the connection between the transport scattering times and the arpes derived self - energy to be studied .",
    "in general , this connection is not straightforward as transport measurements and arpes measure fundamentally different quantities ( _ i.e. _ transport does not probe the single particle spectral function ) .",
    "furthermore , arpes measurements are strongly affected by forward scattering events , while transport measurements are dominated by backscattering events .",
    "other issues include the complication that electron - electron scattering is momentum conserving , and so would not contribute to transport properties unless other scattering processes are available , such as impurity , electron - phonon , and umklapp scattering .",
    "tite@xmath6 has also proven to be an interesting case to compare transport results with arpes spectra .",
    "the temperature dependence of the transport properties implies that the electron - phonon interaction is dominant over a wide temperature range,@xcite which is also inferred by the quasiparticle scattering seen in arpes.@xcite furthermore , the arpes inferred quasiparticle scattering scales with increasing residual resistivity.@xcite however , connections beyond these scalings are not possible because the arpes lineshapes are thought to be strongly effected by the photoelecton lifetime , which is not probed at all by transport measurements .    to date ,",
    "the best studied arpes data comes from the surface states found on cu , ag , mo , _ etc . _",
    "where arpes data interpretation accounts for some of the more subtle effects such as scattering from step edges @xcite .",
    "however , surface states are irrelevant for transport properties , and the magnitude of the _ el - el _ coupling is small enough in these materials that it is a challenge to separate it from the more dominant effects close to @xmath9 .",
    "the difficulties with final state effects in tite@xmath6 and the non - ideal nature of the metal surface states make it necessary to find a strongly 2d system with the electron - electron interaction as the dominant scattering mechanism in order to investigate fl behavior by arpes .",
    "has been shown via bulk transport measurements to exhibit good fl behavior below 30 k.@xcite it is attractive as a model fl system for arpes because it can be grown very cleanly and it has a strongly 2d electronic structure@xcite with a large electrical anisotropy of about 4000.@xcite previous arpes measurements on this material have shown a fs@xcite that matches de haas  van alphen ( dhva ) measurements,@xcite obeys luttinger s counting theorem , and is described well by band structure calculations .",
    "for these reasons  is potentially an ideal material to test whether the arpes linewidths conform to the expectations of fl theory . indeed , we find that the intrinsic linewidths of the spectral peaks are narrower than their binding energy and decrease with a functional dependence compatible with fl theory as the fermi energy is approached . furthermore , we find the electron - electron scattering is dominant over the extracted electron - phonon scattering which is consistent with the extended temperature regime ( up to 30k ) where t@xmath10 dependent transport behavior is seen .",
    "equating the self - energy empirically determined in this paper with the transport scattering time of the simple drude model , we are able to obtain values for the residual resistivity and the coefficient for the t@xmath10 temperature dependent part of the resistivity that are in remarkable agreement with the measured transport properties .",
    "these results clearly show that arpes is a powerful tool to quantitatively study self - energy effects in highly correlated materials , and in appropriate cases may be able to quantify momentum dependent self - energy effects .",
    "the surface of  has been found to reconstruct when cleaved at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "this altered crystal structure corresponds to an enlarged unit cell which gives rise to an altered electronic structure .",
    "a simplified description of these effects is that arpes detects three different sets of bands crossing the fermi energy : the bulk bands , the surface layer bands , and a folded copy of the surface layer bands@xcite(see fig .",
    "although it has been shown that cleaving at high temperatures suppresses the intensity of the surface related features,@xcite it is far from clear exactly what is happening to the surface for this to occur .",
    "since we want to gain knowledge about the bulk electronic structure by pursuing a detailed analysis of the arpes lineshapes  which are strongly affected by surface degradation  we have chosen to cleave the sample at low temperature in order to obtain the best quality data .",
    "when this is done , there is one particular location in the brillioun zone ( bz ) that provides enough separation between the surface layer bands and the bulk bands to allow complete analysis of the lineshape of the bulk band .",
    "this location , which gives access to the dispersing @xmath11 bands from the surface layer and bulk bands , is in the 2nd bz along the @xmath12@xmath13 cut around ( @xmath14 ) , and is indicated as cut `` i '' in figure 1 .",
    "arpes data were collected on a scienta - ses200 analyzer at the stanford synchrotron radiation laboratory beamline 5 - 4 with a photon energy of 24 ev , a temperature of 17 k , and a base pressure of @xmath15 torr .",
    "additional data were collected on a scienta - ses2002 analyzer with he i light from a monochromated and modified gammadata he lamp ; the temperature and pressure were 8k and @xmath16 torr , respectively .",
    "samples were cleaved _ in situ _ at the measurement temperature .",
    "the energy resolution , assumed to be gaussian , and determined by fitting fermi edge spectra from polycrystalline au was set to either 13 mev .",
    "the angular resolution was measured directly from a point source of electrons traversing a square toothed metallic comb before entering the angular resolved electron detector .",
    "the resulting pattern was best fit with a gaussian convolution of the original square toothed profile .",
    "the average angular resolution is @xmath17 , which corresponds to a momentum resolution of @xmath18 @xmath19 at these photon energies .",
    "working within the green s function formalism and invoking the sudden approximation , the intensity measured in an arpes experiment on a 2d single - band material is described by    @xmath20\\otimes r(\\delta { \\bf k},\\delta\\omega)\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 is proportional to the one - electron matrix element and dependent on the polarization and energy of the incoming photon , @xmath22 is the fermi function , and @xmath23 is a background .",
    "@xmath24 is the experimental momentum and energy resolution  the response function of the instrument .",
    "@xmath25 is the single - particle spectral function that contains all the corrections from the many - body interactions in the form of the self - energy , @xmath26 ,    @xmath27^{2}+[\\textrm{im}\\sigma({\\bf k},\\omega)]^{2}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath28 is the bare band dispersion .    within the born approximation ,",
    "the self - energy is written as the sum of individual contributions from all the possible interactions that cause a finite lifetime and energy renormalization of the single particle excitation . in this work",
    "we will be concerned with impurity scattering ( _ imp _ ) , electron - phonon ( _ el - ph _ ) , and electron - electron ( _ el - el _ ) scattering only .",
    "the impurity scattering is assumed to be in the strong scattering limit of isotropic point scatters .",
    "the _ el - ph _ interaction will be described by assuming migdal s theorem is applicable , _",
    "i.e. _ an isotropic system , a large fermi surface , and weak to intermediate _ el - ph _ coupling , @xmath29.@xcite we will assume the _ el - el _ interaction can be described by fl theory . furthermore , we will assume it has negligible @xmath30 dependence , which is consistent with the fs shape being well matched by the non - interacting band structure calculations,@xcite and we neglect any temperature dependence of the _ el - el _ interaction as it is several orders of magnitude smaller than all other terms .",
    "therefore , the total self energy , @xmath31 , will be independent of @xmath30 and correspond to @xmath32 .    since fl theory is normally discussed with relation to transport measurements that only probe quasiparicles within @xmath33 of @xmath9 , it is necessary to justify the much larger energy range ( 0 - 60mev ) over which we will apply fl theory in this paper .",
    "the initial assumption of fl theory is that only the first order terms in the expansion of the _ el - el _ self - energy are significant.@xcite if it is assumed that the coefficients of the higher order terms in the expansion of the _ el - el _ self - energy around @xmath9 are of order unity , then they will not become comparable ( _ e.g. _ larger than @xmath34% of the leading order terms ) until approximately 4060mev .    within the fl framework ,",
    "the spectral function for a quasi - particle can be rewritten in two slightly different forms which ease analysis . for the case of @xmath5 very close to @xmath35 , and therefore much smaller than typical phonon energies",
    "( although we will not be using an explicit model for the _ el - ph _ interaction , we use the debye frequency , @xmath36 in @xcite , as a limiting energy for this case )    @xmath37^{2}+[z^{total}_k\\textrm{im } \\sigma_{total } ( \\omega)]^{2}}\\ ] ]    where we have assumed a linear renormalization for both the _ el - el _ and _ el - ph _ terms so that @xmath38 is the total renormalization factor , and @xmath39 is the fully renormalized band energy .    if the _ el - ph _ renormalization is not assumed to be linear , as may be the case close to the typical phonon energies , it must be left out of the renormalization factor .",
    "the spectral function can then be written in the following form :    @xmath40^{2}+[z^{el\\textrm{-}el}_k\\textrm{im } \\sigma_{total } ( \\omega)]^{2}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath41 is the _ el - el _",
    "renormalization factor , and @xmath42 is the _ el - el _",
    "renormalized band energy .    assuming a linear @xmath30 dependence for the renormalized band , either @xmath43 , or @xmath44 , it is straightforward within this notation to see what can be determined by the standard energy distribution curve ( edc ) and momentum distribution curve ( mdc ) analysis . in mdc analysis ,",
    "a specific @xmath5 value is picked [ @xmath45 and the @xmath30 dependence is that of a lorentzian .",
    "the peak positions , determined at each value of @xmath5 , will generate @xmath46 very close to @xmath35 , or more generally @xmath47 . in both cases",
    "the peak width will be @xmath48 .",
    "edc analysis [ @xmath49 , on the other hand , does not allow such immediate identification of the peak position or the peak width .",
    "note however , that in order to obtain an intrinsic mdc peak position and width from arpes data , the convolution with the resolution function in eq . 1 ,",
    "@xmath50 , needs to be handled correctly .",
    "the convolution leads to a mixing of @xmath30 and @xmath5 , meaning that the shape of the edcs and mdcs will be affected by both energy and momentum resolution . in practice , removing the effects of the convolution on a 2d data set [ @xmath51 is a very challenging problem for which there are two general approaches , as discussed below .",
    "the first one is to choose an analytic expression , with the smallest number of parameters possible , which is then convolved and fit to the measured @xmath52 . due to the lack of knowledge about the the matrix element , @xmath53 , and the background , b , it is a challenge to guess an appropriate functional form for these terms .",
    "therefore , applying a full 2d analytical expression , even to a model material , can require a large number of fitting parameters which significantly reduces the overall confidence in the parameters of interest .",
    "the second is to try a direct deconvolution of the numerical data using image analysis procedures .",
    "the deconvolution of arpes data is unique within the standard set of debluring image analysis problems because we have exact knowledge of our instrument resolution characteristics , or response function , and have a very high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "therefore , a simple wiener filter ( see , for example , ref ) can be very effective .",
    "however , if there is a feature in the data that is sharper than the response function , any numerical deconvolution method will be unable to extract it .",
    "in the case of , the bands are so sharp , as will be shown below , that even 40 mev away from the fermi function , numerical deconvolution is not an effective tool as it manifests artifacts in the resulting spectra .",
    "since the two general techniques for deconvolution have serious complications , we propose a third alternative , a combination of a 1d fitting procedure with a 2d convolution of an analytic expression . by studying the arpes data as a series of independent edcs or mdcs ( i.e 1d analysis ) , the direct influences of @xmath53 on each individual edc or mdc can , in practice , be neglected . however , 1d analysis of the 2d data does not allow full energy and momentum broadening to be applied .",
    "we will show that by comparing the 1d analysis of the data with the 1d analysis of a simulation based on a simplified analytical expression that is correctly convolved with @xmath50 it is possible to account for the equipment resolution effects while not being hindered by the unknown @xmath53 and b.      in fig .",
    "2a , we show the raw data , from the cut marked as `` i '' in fig .",
    "1 . the surface and bulk @xmath11 bands on the left hand side of the figure . in fig 2d",
    "we show just the @xmath11 bands . even though the surface band is relatively weak , but can be clearly distinguished from the bulk band .",
    "the peak position of the mdcs and edcs have also been added to fig .",
    "2d for the bulk @xmath11 band .",
    "one notices immediately that they do not coincide .",
    "the edc peak position never reaches @xmath9 , as expected , due to the fermi function cut off .",
    "it also departs from the mdc peak position at higher binding energies due to effects of the @xmath54 .",

    "it is important to note that @xmath73 , and that the size of the kink seen in the data , often given by the ratio of @xmath74 , can not be used directly to determine @xmath67 , as that will not account for the effect of the _ el - el _ renormalization .",

    "a strongly @xmath1 dependent _ el - ph _ coupling , their chosen location in the bz includes contributions from all three bulk bulk bands , and probably three of the surface layer bands , making it difficult to determine what is contributing to the large kink in their data .    of primary interest to this work",
    "is the width of the peak in mdc analysis , which according to equation 3 or 4 gives access to @xmath77 .",
    "however , due to the energy and momentum resolution effects within equation 1 , we do not have direct access to @xmath77 via the data .",
    "therefore , we set up a simulation which appropriately accounts for these effects and then directly compare the 1d mdc analysis of the data to that of an identical analysis of the simulated spectra . if these match we assume we have determined the correct self - energy to describe the data",
    "the simulation is based on equations 1 and 4 ( setting @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) , using the @xmath70 , and @xmath80 from above , @xmath81 taken directly from data ( and therefore model independent ) , and @xmath77 consisting of @xmath82 .",
    "the functional form of @xmath81 is determined by the difference between @xmath83 and the mdc peak position of the data , as shown in fig .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath81 is left as a parameter within the simulation , and is chosen such that the mdc peak positions of the simulated spectra and the data match . included in fig .",

    "the magnitude of @xmath81 is chosen so that the mdc peak positions of the simulated spectra and the data match , and so is a free parameter in the simulation .",
    "it should be noted that when the @xmath86 starts to decrease ( at about 80mev in the data ) , we can no longer be tracking the quasiparticle , and therefore equation 4 is no longer strictly valid.@xcite    the three terms of @xmath77 within the simulation are each handled differently . in the limit of strong scattering from isotropic point scatterers",
    "@xmath87 is a constant , which is a free parameter in the simulation .",
    "the functional form of @xmath88 is determined via the kramer kronig transformation of the empirical @xmath81.@xcite the magnitude of @xmath88 is fixed by the magnitude chosen for @xmath81 , as discussed above . the functional form and the magnitude of @xmath89",

    "the shape of the mdc peak will not be a lorentzian , due to the convolution in equation 1 , whenever the energy or momentum resolution is nonzero .",
    "therefore , to obtain a decent fit to mdc peak shape of the data and the simulated spectra we use a lorentzian convolved with a gaussian , whose width is chosen to be the experimental momentum resolution .",
    "the neglected effects of energy resolution within the 1d mdc analysis does not allow the true @xmath93 to be extracted , and hence we label the width as @xmath94 .",

    "1 ) , an attempt at the quantitative analysis on the surface layer @xmath11 band is problematic .",
    "we find that the noise in the mdc peak positions for the surface layer @xmath11 band is too large to clearly establish the presence or absence of _ el - ph _ coupling which significantly decreases the confidence level for determining the functional form of @xmath89 .",
    "however , two qualitative conclusions can be drawn from a comparison between the extracted @xmath116 from the mdc width of the surface layer @xmath11 band compared to that from the bulk @xmath11 band ( shown in the insert of figure 5 ) .",
    "the first is that the quasiparticles in the surface layer @xmath11 band have an impurity scattering component to the self - energy that is comparable to that of the bulk states .",
    "secondly , the comparison between the @xmath5 dependences of the surface layer and bulk @xmath11 bands suggests that the quasiparticles located in the reconstructed surface layer @xmath11 band undergo many - body interactions of about the same magnitude as those of the bulk @xmath11 band .",
    "with the fitting procedure described above , we are able to retrieve the imaginary part of the self - energy of the bulk @xmath11 band with minimal _ a priori _ knowledge while accounting for both the instrument energy and momentum resolution .",
    "the extracted self - energy of the bulk band contains three terms : an isotropic impurity scattering term @xmath117mev , an _ el - ph _ term defined by @xmath118 , and an _ el - el _ term that is best fit by @xmath119ev .",
    "the self - energy extracted in this work indicates that @xmath77 approaches zero as we approach the the fermi energy , implying that at @xmath9 the deconvolved mdc and edc peaks are extremely sharp . due to instrument broadening",
    ", the raw data will not show this directly .",
    "the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath95 is best fit over a 60mev window with an _ el - el _ component that suggests scattering with a reduced phase space from the case of a spherical fs of the canonical 3d fl and also from a cylindrical 2d fl ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "the @xmath11 band in  is a hybridization of two 1d bands , derived from @xmath121 and @xmath122 , which form a very flattened 2d cylindrical fs .",
    "furthermore there are two other bulk bands ( the @xmath123 and @xmath76 bands ) and 6 other surface related bands which cross the fermi energy .",
    "the phase space present for quasiparticle scattering from the @xmath11 band , and therefore the functional form of @xmath116 , will be subtly influenced by the coupling between the bands in addition to the shape of the fs .",
    "therefore , we would not necessarily expect @xmath89 for  to have an exact 2d or 3d fl form .",
    "a fl is defined by the presence of quasiparticles , which requires that @xmath54 decreases to zero sufficiently fast with respect to @xmath124 so that there is a discontinuity in @xmath2 .",
    "it has recently been carefully shown that the @xmath125 dependence of a 2d cylindrical fl does , in fact , show a discontinuity in @xmath2.@xcite it is not clear at which point reduced scattering will lead to a breakdown of fl theory , although this work suggests that the 2d cylindrical fs may not be the limiting case .    by assuming that we can make a direct connection between the renormalized imaginary part of the self - energy and the transport scattering time , @xmath126,@xcite we can use a simple drude model ( @xmath127 ) to draw a comparison with transport properties .",
    "the residual resistivity is therefore determined by the renormalized impurity scattering self - energy ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath129 may be transformed to a temperature dependence  by replacing @xmath5 with @xmath130 because the thermal energy has a characteristic energy scale of t from the fermi energy  allowing the @xmath131 coefficient of the resistivity to be calculated .",
    "since we measure @xmath132 at only one @xmath1 point in only one of three bands , we must assume that there is no @xmath1 dependence , and no band dependence on the scattering rate to calculate @xmath133 .",
    "using the mass renormalization from the measured @xmath71 of this work for the @xmath11 band , the dhva@xcite results for the @xmath123 and @xmath76 bands , and the number of carriers from dhva@xcite or the arpes fermi surface@xcite , we calculate the residual resistivity to be @xmath134 cm .",
    "this value is in very good agreement with the published residual resistivities ( 0.1 - 0.5 @xmath135 cm ) for samples with comparable @xmath136.@xcite the coefficient of the @xmath131 temperature dependent term in the resistivity is calculated@xcite to be @xmath137 cm k@xmath138 , very close to the value of @xmath139 cm k@xmath138 from hussey _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "mackenzie et al .",
    "@xcite have suggested via the weak field hall effect that there is no @xmath140 or band dependence of the impurity scattering .",
    "therefore the assumptions used to calculate the residual resistivity from the arpes measured impurity scattering self energy may be appropriate .",
    "this , however , leaves all the possible k - dependence of the self - energy to the electron - electron part .",
    "ideally photoemission is the perfect tool to study this , and this work shows that with appropriate data handling arpes can be used to obtain such information .    recent work by kidd _ et al._@xcite attempts to study this issue in .",
    "they see a lack of significant broadening of the mdc width for the @xmath123 band in , as a function of temperature or @xmath5 , as compared to the @xmath76 band .",
    "they claim this indicates exotic properties consistent with the quasi-1d nature of the @xmath123 band .",
    "they then use this to argue that this band must play a large role in the high temperature , non - fl , transport properties , while not being significant in the low temperature , fl , transport properties . in , the @xmath11 and @xmath123 bands originate from the @xmath141 and @xmath142 ru orbitals , and are expected to show very similar behavior .",
    "our work clearly shows that on a very clean surface and with the energy and momentum broadening are handled in detail , the @xmath11 band shows very strong @xmath5 dependence in the mdc width .",
    "also , our calculations of the residual resistivity and the @xmath131 temperature dependent coefficient of @xmath133 strongly suggest that the quasiparticle scattering from the @xmath11 band should not be significantly larger than from the @xmath76 band at the temperature of our experiment .",
    "it is important to note the width of their mdc peaks for both the @xmath123 and @xmath76 bands at @xmath9 are @xmath143 0.04 @xmath19 , which is significantly wider that those for the @xmath11 band from this paper , @xmath143 0.008 @xmath19 .",
    "a note of caution must be mentioned regarding the data analysis of our work .",
    "the initial step in the data analysis , going from eq . 2 to eq .",
    "3 , specifically makes use of the assumed linear dependence of @xmath144 on @xmath5 . for a 3d fl ,",
    "this is appropriate .",
    "however , the logarithmic corrections to @xmath102 for the 2d case also require corrections to the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath144 .",
    "this is also the case for the _ emp . _",
    "these nonlinear terms in @xmath145 or @xmath146 make the simple interpretation of an mdc as a lorentzian peak with peak position given by @xmath47 and a width by @xmath147 no longer strictly correct .",
    "we propose a method to account for the full energy and momentum broadening effects of the instrument from the arpes spectra , which then allows quantitative analysis of the quasiparticle many - body interactions . with this method",
    "we find the form of @xmath54 for the  bulk @xmath11 band to be consistent with a fl : as @xmath9 is approached @xmath148 , which we find to be 1mev ; and the @xmath5 functional form , best fit by @xmath149ev , suggests that the reduced dimensionality is affecting the quasiparticle - quasiparticle scattering . beyond the functional form and asymptotic behavior of the extracted @xmath54 , the magnitude",
    "is also found to be consistent with transport measurements .",
    "assuming that the quasiparticle lifetime can be directly related to the transport scattering rate , the drude model can then be used to calculate a residual resistivity in the @xmath7 plane , and the @xmath131 resistivity coefficient .",
    "our calculated values ( @xmath150 cm , @xmath151 cm k@xmath138 , respectively ) are in remarkable agreement with the experimentally determined ones ( @xmath152 cm , @xmath153 cm k@xmath138 , respectively ) .",
    "furthermore , we find very similar many - body interactions for quasiparticles residing in the surface layer @xmath11 band .",
    "this work demonstrates that when the full energy and momentum broadening are accounted for , arpes is capable of showing the expected size of the linewidths for a model fermi liquid , and gives unique access to the energy dependence of those linewidths .",
    "this analysis , in conjunction with the fermi surface previously measured by damascelli _",
    "et al._@xcite , give the first complete picture of a fermi liquid from arpes .",
    "it also highlights the large effect that energy and momentum broadening can have on measured linewidths , and some of the difficulties in trying to appropriately handle them in the data analysis .",
    "finally it suggests that arpes can be a very powerful tool to quantitatively study the @xmath1 dependence of the self - energy , a concept that is becoming more and more significant .",

    "1 the positions of the mdc peaks ( see figure 4 ) of the simulations are strongly altered , turned - up , at energies close to @xmath9 when the energy broadening part of the resolution function , @xmath154 , is larger than the width of the fermi function ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "this also manifests itself as a strong reduction in the width of the mdc . in figure 5 , for each situation in the graph there are two lines , one of which shows a significant decrease in width as @xmath9 is approached starting at a binding energy of @xmath156mev .",
    "these dotted lines are calculated from eq . 1 ,",
    "while the lines that have an asymptotic behavior as @xmath9 is approached are calculated with the fermi function @xmath22 removed from eq . 1 .    in general , the simplest model of the single particle spectral function , a delta function , when placed in eq .",
    "1 predicts that both the edc and mdc peak position are pushed away from the real band position as @xmath9 is approached if @xmath155 .",
    "this fact makes it clear that the effect is not related to the presence , or form , of the self - energy , but is rather _ directly connected to the convolution of the fermi function with the resolution function_.    this predicted mdc turn - up has not been seen in the published  data @xcite , nor is it seen in the published cuprate arpes data [ see ref . , and references within ] .",
    "it has also not been seen in the surface state data on cu , ag , au,@xcite , or the quantum well states in pb on si,@xcite , however these data are usually taken with resolution and temperature conditions such that @xmath157 .",

    ". 1 .    in an attempt to understand this issue",
    ", it is worth looking at both the presence of the fermi function and the form of the resolution broadening .",
    "the fermi function is present in equation 1 in order to introduce a temperature dependence to a zero temperature single particle spectral function , @xmath160 . in a noninteracting system",
    "there is no temperature dependence of @xmath160 .",
    "however , arpes only measures the @xmath0 , or electron removal , part of @xmath160 which does have a temperature dependence given by the fermi function . as interactions are adiabatically turned on",
    ", this will continue to hold .",
    "therefore , in the case of a fl , such as , we expect that @xmath161 is the correct form to include temperature dependence . for a non - fl spectral function ( such as that expected for the cuprates ) this argument , in general , will not hold .",
    "experimentally , the resolution function may not be appropriately accounted for by the convolution in equation 1 .",
    "we can directly measure the momentum broadening , as mentioned in the experimental section , and find that it does look like a gaussian convolution .",
    "however , we do not have such direct access to the appropriate functional form of the energy broadening . at present , an unexplained effect of the resolution function looks like the most likely culprit for the discrepancy close to @xmath35 between the simulation via equation 1 and the data ."
