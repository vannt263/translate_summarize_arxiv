    "the concept of open quantum systems is a ubiquitous one in that any real system of interest is surrounded by its environment ( reservoir or bath ) , which influences its dynamics .",
    "they provide a natural route for discussing damping and dephasing .",
    "one of the first testing grounds for open system ideas was in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "its application to other areas gained momentum from the works of caldeira and leggett @xcite , and zurek @xcite among others . depending upon the system - reservoir ( @xmath0 ) interaction ,",
    "open systems can broadly be classified into two categories , viz . ,",
    "quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) or dissipative . a particular type of quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) @xmath0 interaction is given by a class of energy - preserving measurements in which dephasing occurs without damping the system .",
    "this may be achieved when the hamiltonian @xmath1 of the system commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath2 describing the system - reservoir interaction , i.e. , @xmath2 is a constant of the motion generated by @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "a dissipative open system would be when @xmath1 and @xmath2 do not commute resulting in dephasing along with damping @xcite .",
    "a prototype of dissipative open quantum systems , having many applications , is the quantum brownian motion of harmonic oscillators .",
    "this model was studied by caldeira and leggett @xcite for the case where the system and its environment were initially separable .",
    "the above treatment of the quantum brownian motion was generalized to the physically reasonable initial condition of a mixed state of the system and its environment by hakim and ambegaokar @xcite , smith and caldeira @xcite , grabert , schramm and ingold @xcite , and for the case of a system in a stern - gerlach potential @xcite , and also for the quantum brownian motion with nonlinear system - environment couplings @xcite , among others .",
    "the interest in the relevance of open system ideas to quantum information and quantum computation has burgeoned in recent times because of the impressive progress made on the experimental front in the manipulation of quantum states of matter towards quantum information processing and quantum communication .",
    "a number of open system effects can be given an operator - sum or kraus representation @xcite .",
    "in this representation , a superoperator @xmath3 due to interaction with the environment , acting on the state of the system is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the unitary operator representing the free evolution of the system , reservoir , as well as the interaction between the two , @xmath6 is the environment s initial state , and @xmath7 is a basis for the environment .",
    "the environment and the system are assumed to start in a separable state .",
    "the @xmath8 are the kraus operators , which satisfy the completeness condition @xmath9 .",
    "it can be shown that any transformation that can be cast in the form ( [ eq : kraus ] ) is a completely positive ( cp ) map @xcite .    to connect the predicted effects to actual experiments , a detailed model of the interaction between the principal system and the environment is required . however , from the viewpoint of a number of applications to quantum computation and information processing , these details may not be of immediate relevance .",
    "in such a case , the kraus representation is useful because it provides an intrinsic description of the principal system , without explicitly considering the detailed properties of the environment @xcite .",
    "the essential features of the problem are contained in the operators @xmath10 .",
    "this not only simplifies calculations , but often provides theoretical insight .",
    "an example we will encounter below is the interplay between environmental squeezing and thermal effects for the case of dissipative system - reservoir interactions .",
    "moreover , the reduced dynamics of a number of , seemingly different , physical systems could be modelled in the quantum operations formalism @xcite by the same noisy channel .",
    "this would help in the development of insight into the common features of the reduced dynamics of the above systems .",
    "for example , for the case of a two - level system interacting , via a quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) interaction , either with a bath of two - level systems ( in the weak coupling limit ) or harmonic oscillators ( at zero temperature @xmath11 and zero bath squeezing ) , the reduced dynamics in the quatum operations formalism can be shown to be governed by the phase damping channel @xcite .",
    "another example would be the reduced dynamics of a simplified jaynes - cummings model consisting of a two - level atom coupled to a single cavity mode which in turn is interacting with a vacuum bath of harmonic oscillators .",
    "this can , considering only a single excitation in the atom - cavity system , be shown to be generated by an amplitude damping channel . since as shown below , an amplitude damping channel results generally from the interactions governed by the lindblad type of evolution ( at zero @xmath11 and zero bath squeezing ) , this enables us to get an understanding of the reduced dynamics of the above system without having to concern ourselves with particular details .",
    "in this paper we study an open system , taken to be two - level system or qubit , where the bath is taken to be initially in a squeezed thermal state .",
    "the resulting dynamics , governed by a lindblad - type evolution , generates a completely positive map that extends the concept of a generalized amplitude damping channel , which corresponds to a dissipative interaction with a purely thermal bath .",
    "we present the kraus representation of this map , which we call the squeezed generalized amplitude damping channel .",
    "an advantage of using a squeezed thermal bath is that the decay rate of quantum coherence can be suppressed leading to preservation of nonclassical effects @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown to modify the evolution of the geometric phase of two - level atomic systems @xcite .",
    "the preservation of entanglement in the presence of a squeezed bath has been investigated in ref .",

    "a natural question is as to how information communicated over a squeezed generalized amplitude damping channel ( denoted @xmath150 , and given in the kraus representation by eq .",
    "( [ eq : new0 ] ) , is degraded . in this section ,",
    "we briefly consider the communication of classical information across the channel @xcite .",
    "the problem can be stated as the following game between sender alice and receiver bob : alice has a classical information source producing symbols @xmath151 with probabilities @xmath152 .",
    "she encodes the symbols as quantum states @xmath153 ( @xmath154 ) and communicates them to bob , whose optimal measurement strategy maximizes his accessible information , which is bounded above by the holevo quantity @xmath155 where @xmath156 , and @xmath153 are various initial states @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "we assume alice encodes her binary symbols of 0 and 1 in terms of pure , orthogonal states of the form ( [ 4b6 ] ) , and transmits them over the squeezed generalized amplitude damping channel .",
    "we further assume that alice transmits her messages as product states , i.e. , without entangling them across multiple channel use .",

    "[ fig : holevo_theta ] depicts @xmath165 for various channel parameters , with the pair of orthogonal input states given by @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "as expected , longer exposure to the channel , or higher temperature , degrades information more , but the optimal choice of input states remains the same as before .",
    "interestingly , squeezing improves the accessible information for input states in a certain range of @xmath168 , but impairs it in other .",
    "this is consistent with the understanding that the benefits of squeezing are quadrature - dependent .",
