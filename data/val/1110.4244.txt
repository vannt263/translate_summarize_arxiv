    "recent advent of radioactive beam facilities is extending more and more widely the research area of nuclear physics .",
    "it is increasingly important to have a unified understanding of nuclear structure in various regions of the nuclear chart , with variety of ingredients such as shell effects , deformations and collective motions like rotation and vibration .",
    "undoubtedly , the basic starting point is the selfconsistent mean - field approximation  @xcite , e.g. , the hartree - fock ( hf ) or the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) method including pairing correlations , with suitably chosen density - dependent effective interactions , or in a modern terminology , energy density functionals ; see e.g. ref .  @xcite . with the symmetry - breaking",
    ", relatively simple mean - field states can take into account most of the many - body correlations in a very efficient way  @xcite , and have been successfully applied to study various nuclear phenomena not only near the ground state but also in the low- to high - spin excited states  @xcite .    however , the symmetry - breaking mean - field description is not enough because it represents merely the intrinsic state and the broken symmetry should be recovered in the laboratory frame .",
    "one of the most important consequences of the symmetry - breaking is the appearance of the symmetry - restoring collective motion .",
    "one well - adopted method to restore the symmetry is to utilize a phenomenological collective model like the rotor description in the unified model of bohr - mottelson  @xcite .",
    "one can consistently introduce the redundant collective coordinate into the many - body theory by employing the quantum mechanical constraint formalism ( the gauge theory ) between the nucleon and collective degrees of freedom , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ; its exact treatment is rather involved .",
    "another way , without recourse to the external variables , to restore the symmetry within the nucleon degrees of freedom is the quantum number projection  @xcite .",
    "existence of a symmetry - breaking mean - field state means that all the states connected by the symmetry operation , e.g. , rotation of the system , are degenerate .",
    "superposition of all these degenerate states gives a better quantum mechanical description in the variational sense , as it is clear in the formulation of the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) .",
    "since the symmetry requires the specific form of weight functions for superposition , the procedure restores the symmetry at the same time , i.e. , projects out the states with good quantum numbers .",
    "the most important symmetry - breaking in nuclear structure is the spatial deformation , e.g. , the quadrupole shape , so that the projection of the angular momentum is necessary to obtain the eigenstates of the angular momentum operators , especially for calculating the electromagnetic transition probabilities .",
    "there is a long history in the angular momentum projection calculations . except for some special calculations intended for very light nuclei ,",
    "the general framework of the projection from the ( hfb - like ) general product - type mean - field wave functions has been developed by k.  hara and his collaborators in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the calculation is restricted to the axially symmetric shape , but extended to the triaxially deformed and cranked ( for high - spins ) cases in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also the review paper  @xcite , and a more recent application  @xcite ) . based on the angular momentum projection , the variation after projection calculations from general mean - field states have also been performed for the @xmath1-matrix based realistic interactions , see e.g. refs .",
    "however , relatively small model spaces are used in these works , e.g. , the two or three harmonic oscillator shells .",
    "recently , the angular momentum projection with much larger space has been attempted with restriction of axially symmetry , intending to employ the skyrme ( or more general ) energy functional  @xcite , where the gcm calculation with respect to the quadrupole deformed coordinates on top of it is performed ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for the similar type calculation with the finite range gogny interaction ) .",
    "the restriction of axial symmetry has been lifted in more recent works for the skyrme  @xcite , the relativistic mean - field  @xcite , and the gogny  @xcite approaches , although still the time - reversal invariance ( no - cranking ) and the @xmath2 symmetry of deformation are imposed in such calculations .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss an efficient method of general quantum number projection , i.e. , rather technical aspect of projection .",
    "we intend to perform the angular momentum projection with other projections , the number and parity , at the same time from the most general symmetry - breaking hfb type mean - field , i.e. , the axial symmetry , the parity , as well as the time - reversal invariance are broken . for this kind of the most general projection , the frequently used speed - up technique , for example , using the @xmath2 symmetry that reduces the integration volume of the three euler angles by factor 16 , can not be utilized .",
    "therefore an efficient method to perform the projection is crucial .",
    "the basic ingredient of the projection is the overlap of operators between the product - type mean - field wave functions , based on the generalized wick theorem  @xcite . for evaluation of such overlaps many matrix operations composed of the multiplication , inverse and determinant , are necessary , and so the dimension of matrices is the most crucial factor .",
    "one of the essential ideas of our efficient method has been invented and discussed already in the appendices of ref .",
    "@xcite ; in fact we have noticed this reference after finishing our work ( see also refs .",
    "it is based on the fact that , although the model space for calculating the realistic single - particle states are large , the effective number of states contributing the hfb type product states are relatively small because the nuclear superfluidity is not so strong : if there is no pairing correlation , the mean - field state is a slater determinant composed of the single - particle wave functions whose number is nothing else but the number of constituent particles .",
    "the truncation of the effective model space reduces the dimension of matrices dramatically in the most essential part of the calculation .",
    "another important point of our method is that we make full use of the thouless amplitudes rather than the @xmath3 amplitudes of the generalized bogoliubov transformation  @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons for this is that the sign of the norm overlap between general product - type wave functions can be precisely calculated by using their thouless amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "moreover , as a vacuum state , with respect to which the thouless form of the general hfb type state is considered , we employ a suitably chosen slater determinantal state , i.e. , the particle - hole vacuum in place of the true nucleon vacuum is utilized .",
    "this increases the numerical stability of the thouless amplitude ( @xmath4 ) for the case of vanishing pairing correlations on one hand , and makes it possible to truncate further the space composed of deep hole states ( the core contributions ) on the other hand , which is very effective for calculations of heavy nuclei .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",

    "the results of example calculations are shown and discussed in sec .",

    "[ sec : summary ] is devoted to the summary .",

    "@xcite ) .",
    "the hamiltonian is composed of the one - body part and the two - body interaction , @xmath5 whose explicit form is specified in the next section . here",
    "@xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) are the basic particle ( nucleon ) creation and annihilation operators , with @xmath8 being the number of basis states .",
    "the appropriate choice of this original basis is very important to perform the angular momentum projection effectively . in this paper",
    "we choose the spherical ( isotropic ) harmonic oscillator basis , @xmath9 , where the selection of the harmonic oscillator is optional ; what is important is that the angular momentum @xmath10 is a good quantum number because the representation of the rotation matrix in this basis is block diagonal .",
    "another possible choice for the case that the two - body interaction is local like the skyrme and gogny forces is the isotropic cartesian harmonic oscillator basis , in which the rotation operator about one of the three axes is again represented by a block diagonal matrix with very few non - zero elements .    the fundamental object for the projection ( or gcm ) calculation is overlap @xmath11 of an arbitrary operator @xmath12 between two general product - type states @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "these mean - field states are vacuums of the quasiparticle operators , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , which are related to the original particle basis by the following general bogoliubov transformations , @xmath17 , \\qquad   \\hat \\beta_{k}'^\\dagger = \\sum_{l } \\left [    u'_{lk}\\hat c_{l}^\\dagger + v'_{lk}\\hat c_{l}^ { }   \\right ] .",

    "the unitary transformation is generated by a one - body hermitian operator @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) ; most generally , @xmath71 the norm overlap of two normalized hfb type states @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the thouless form is given in eq .",
