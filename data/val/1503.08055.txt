    "the higgs boson has been found at the lhc by the atlas experiment  @xcite and the cms experiment  @xcite .",
    "after that , understanding the properties of a higgs boson through the precise measurement is important for particle physics . a branching ratio ( br )",
    "is one of the most important properties of a higgs boson . in the standard model ,",
    "the yukawa coupling of matter fermions with a higgs boson is completely proportional to the fermion mass .",
    "however , the yukawa coupling will deviate from the prediction of the standard model if there are new physics .",
    "the pattern of deviation depends on the new physics model .",
    "thus , understanding a higgs boson is very important from the viewpoint of new physics .    besides",
    ", the size of the deviation is expected to be small if the scale of new physics is high .",
    "specifically , the allowed deviation can be at the few - percent level even if no additional new particles are to be found at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "since the branching ratio measurement is used as an input in the extraction of the yukawa coupling , a precise determination of the branching ratio is essential to probe new physics .    in this study , we focus on the branching ratio of the higgs boson decaying into tau lepton pairs .",
    "the mass of the tau lepton is known to a very good precision unlike quarks , which typically suffer from the theoretical uncertainties arising from qcd .",
    "also , the deviation in the lepton yukawa coupling could well differ from the quark yukawa coupling , such as in the lepton - specific two - higgs doublet model .",
    "thus , the tau yukawa coupling is an ideal probe for new physics .    in this study",
    ", we estimate the measurement accuracy @xmath5 of the @xmath7 branching ratio at the center - of - mass energy of 250 gev and 500 gev at the ilc with the ild full detector simulation . in this proceedings",
    ", we will discuss the 250 gev case , based on our talk at the lcws14  @xcite .",
    "the feynman diagrams of the higgs boson production processes are shown in figure  [ signals ] .",
    "the higgs - strahlung process ( @xmath3 ) is the most dominant production processes at the center - of - mass energy ( @xmath8 ) of 250 gev .",
    "we analyze this process with the @xmath9 boson decaying into quark pair ( @xmath10 ) , which is expected to be the most sensitive channel because of the high statistics .",
    "the cross section of the higgs - strahlung process at @xmath11 gev is about 300  fb  @xcite .",
    "the diagrams for the main backgrounds which have the same(similar ) final state as the signal are shown in figure  [ backgrounds ] .",
    "the @xmath12 process shown in left of figure  [ backgrounds ] is an irreducible background to the signal . besides , the semi - leptonic decay of di - boson processes such as @xmath13 shown in figure  [ backgrounds ] right will also to be the source of backgrounds due to the similar final states to the signal",
    "we assume a higgs mass of @xmath14 gev , a branching ratio of @xmath15  @xcite , an integrated luminosity of 250 fb@xmath2 , and beam polarizations of @xmath16 .",
    "we use the monte - carlo samples which are prepared for the studies presented in the ilc technical design report  @xcite ( so called tdr sample ) . besides , we use the event generator  @xcite with using grace  @xcite and generate monte - carlo samples of the processes of @xmath17 with @xmath7 where @xmath18 denotes a fermion , because the spin correlation of @xmath7 was not treated properly in tdr samples .",
    "therefore , we do not use the events which contain @xmath7 processes in tdr samples to avoid double counting .",
    "the beam energy spectrum includes the effects due to beamstrahlung and the initial state radiation . the beam - induced backgrounds from @xmath19 interactions which give rise to hadrons are included in all signal and background processes .",
    "the background processes from @xmath20 interactions are categorized according to the number of final - state fermions : two fermions ( 2f ) , three fermions ( 1f`_`3f ) , and four fermions ( 4f ) .",
    "we also include @xmath21  2f and @xmath21  4f processes for this study .",
    "the detector response is simulated using full simulation based on geant4  @xcite .",
    "we perform the detector simulation with ` mokka `  @xcite , a geant4-based full simulation , with the ild detector model of ` ild_o1_v05 ` . `",
    "tauola `  @xcite is used for the tau decay simulation .",
    "the ild detector model consists of a vertex detector , a time projection chamber , an electromagnetic calorimeter , a hadronic calorimeter , a return yoke , muon systems , and forward components .",
    "even in the signal processes , some hadrons generated via the beam - induced @xmath22 interactions are included .",
    "but at the @xmath11 gev , the numbers of hadrons are estimated to be small  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we do not apply any special treatment to eliminate these hadrons .",
    "the event reconstruction is consisted of three steps ; ( 1 ) tau reconstruction , ( 2 ) collinear approximation , and ( 3 ) @xmath9 boson reconstruction .    first , we apply tau finder .",
    "our tau finder searches for charged track which have highest energy among the remaining particles , and combines the neighboring particles which satisfy @xmath23 , with the combined mass less than 2 gev , where @xmath24 is the cone angle with respect to the highest energy charged track .",
    "the combined object is regarded as a tau candidate .",
    "then , we apply the selection cuts to tau candidates as following ; discard the candidates which categorized into 3-prong with neutral particles , @xmath25 gev where @xmath26 is the energy of tau candidate , and satisfy @xmath27 with @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the cone energy of a tau candidate with the cone angle of @xmath30 , and @xmath30 is the cone angle with respect to a tau candidate , respectively .",
    "these selections are tuned to minimize the misidentification of fragments of quark jets as tau decays .",
    "after the selection , we apply the charge recovery process to obtain better efficiency .",
    "the charged particles in a tau candidate which have the energy less than 2 gev are detached one by one , the one with the smallest energy first , until satisfying the following conditions ; the charge of a tau candidate is exactly equal to @xmath31 , and the number of track(s ) in a tau candidate is exactly equal to 1 or 3 .",
    "the tau candidate after the detaching is rejected if it does not satisfy the above conditions , and remaining candidate is regarded as a tau jet .",
    "we repeat the above processes until there are no charged particles which have the energy greater than 2 gev .    after finishing the tau reconstruction ,",
    "we apply the collinear approximation  @xcite to reconstruct the invariant mass of tau pair system . in this approximation",
    ", we assume that the visible decay products of the tau lepton and the neutrino(s ) from the tau decay is collinear , and the contribution of the missing transverse momentum comes only from the neutrino(s ) from tau decay .",
    "after the approximation , we apply the durham jet clustering  @xcite with two jets for the remaining objects to reconstruct @xmath9 boson .",
    "before optimizing the cuts , we apply preselection cuts as following ;    * the number of reconstructed @xmath32 and @xmath33 are exactly equal to one , * the number of reconstructed jet is exactly equal to two , * the number of track in an event is greater or equal to nine , * @xmath34 and @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the invariant mass ( energy ) of tau pair with collinear approximation in the unit of gev .",
    "in addition , we apply the following cuts to suppress the trivial backgrounds ;    * @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the visible energy ( mass ) in the unit of gev , * @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the sum of the magnitude of the transverse momentum of each particle in the unit of gev , * the thrust in an event should be less than @xmath42 , * @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the energy ( invariant mass ) of reconstructed two jets in the unit of gev , * @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the angle between two jets , * @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the energy ( invariant mass ) of reconstructed two taus without collinear approximation in the unit of gev , * @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the angle between two taus , * @xmath53 and @xmath54 , * @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the recoil mass against @xmath9 boson .",
    "we only use the events passed the preselection and cuts above for the optimization of event selection .",
    "we perform the cut - based analysis and multivariate analysis both .",
    "the optimization is performed to maximize the signal statistical significance of @xmath57 , where s(b ) is the number of signal(background ) .",
    "we apply the following cuts sequentially to extract maximum signal significance ;    * @xmath58 gev , * @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the angle between missing momentum in an event and beam axis , * @xmath61 gev , @xmath62 gev , * @xmath63 gev , @xmath64 gev , @xmath65 , * @xmath66 gev , @xmath67 gev , * @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the impact parameter @xmath70 ( @xmath71-plane ) divided by the error of @xmath70 for @xmath32 , * @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the impact parameter @xmath74 ( @xmath75-plane ) divided by the error of @xmath74 for @xmath32 , * @xmath76 gev .",
    "figure  [ mass_colapp ] shows the @xmath77 distribution in the sequential cuts .",
    "after all cuts above , the signal events of 1002 and the background events of 535.4 are remained .",
    "the statistical significance is calculated to be @xmath78 .",
    "this result corresponds to the precision of @xmath79 .",
    "we use the tmva package in root  @xcite and use the gradient boosted decision tree ( bdtg ) technique for the analysis tool .",
    "we use the following 17 variables as the inputs ;    * three variables from the overall event : @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , where @xmath81 is the magnitude of the transverse momentum calculated from the momentum vector of all visible particles in an event , * three variables from reconstructed jets and @xmath9 boson : @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the angle between the momentum of reconstructed @xmath9 boson and beam axis , * seven variables from reconstructed taus : @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the acoplanarity angle between two taus , @xmath95 is the angle between the momentum of reconstructed higgs boson without collinear approximation and beam axis , * three variables from collinear approximation : @xmath77 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the angle between reconstructed higgs momentum and beam axis with collinear approximation , * one from recoil mass : @xmath56 .",
    "figure  [ bdtg_qqh250 ] shows the response of the multivariate classifier .",
    "the number of events surviving the event selection is 1205 for the signal and 521.4 for the background .",
    "the signal significance is calculated to be @xmath99 , which implies a precision of @xmath100 .",
    "the result of the multivariate analysis improved by @xmath101 than the cut - based analysis .",
    "we previously performed the analysis with fully simulated samples at @xmath11 gev , and the results are written in ref  @xcite . in ref",
    "@xcite , the analysis had been performed with the condition of higgs mass of 120 gev , and analyzed three signal modes : @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 . the combined result with the extrapolation to the higgs mass of 125",
    "gev was @xmath105 .",
    "the results described in section 5 are much better than previous study , even the cross section and the branching ratio of @xmath7  @xcite are worse than the case of higgs mass of 120 gev and only using @xmath102 mode",
    ". these differences mainly come from the mass difference between @xmath9 boson and higgs boson , and the difference of analysis technique .",
    "now we can apply tighter cuts in the recoil mass against @xmath9 boson than previously , because the peak of recoil mass shifted from 120 gev to 125 gev .",
    "this difference introduces good separation power between signal and background . besides",
    ", we only had been performed cut - based analysis in previous .",
    "the cut - based analysis is very simple and easy to understand , but difficult to get better precision .",
    "the multivariate analysis gives us much better results than the cut - based , as described on section 5.2 .",
    "we evaluated the expected measurement accuracy of the branching ratio @xmath5 of the @xmath7 mode at @xmath11 gev at the ilc with a full simulation of the ild detector model , assuming @xmath14 gev , @xmath15 , @xmath106 , and beam polarizations @xmath16 .",
