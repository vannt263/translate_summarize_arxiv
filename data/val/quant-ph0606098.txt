    "quantum computation employs the principle of coherent superposition and quantum entanglement to solve certain problems , such as factoring large integers and searching data in an array , much faster than a classical computer @xcite .",
    "the basic building blocks of a quantum computer are quantum logic gates .",
    "it was shown that any quantum computation can be reduced to a sequence of two classes of quantum gates , namely , universal two - qubit logic gates and one - qubit local operations universal .",
    "the standard paradigm of quantum computation is the dynamical one where the local interactions between the qubits are controlled in such a way so that one can enact a sequence of quantum gates . on the other hand",
    ", it has been recognized that the quantum gate operations can also be implemented through the geometric effects on the wave function of the systems , this is the so - called geometric quantum computation @xcite .",
    "compared with the dynamical gates , the geometric quantum computation possesses practical advantages .",
    "it is well known that geometric phases depend only on some global geometric features , and do not depend on the details of the path , the time spent , the driving hamiltonian , and the initial and final states of the evolution @xcite .",
    "therefore the geometric quantum computation is largely insensitive to local inaccuracies and fluctuations , and thus provides us a possible way to achieve fault - tolerant quantum gates .    in the implementation of geometric quantum computation ,",
    "one practical question we usually meet is how to remove or avoid the dynamical phases since geometric phases are generally accompanied by dynamical ones which are not robust against local inaccuracies and fluctuations . to this end",
    "one simple method is to choose the dark states as qubit space , thus the dynamical phase is always zero @xcite .",
    "another general method is to let the evolution be dragged by the hamiltonian along several special closed loops , then the dynamical phases accumulated in different loops may be canceled , with the geometric phases being added @xcite .",
    "this is the so - called multi - loop scheme .",
    "the geometric quantum computation which is based on the cancelation of dynamical phases is referred to as conventional geometric quantum computation .",
    "correspondingly several schemes have been presented recently to realize the so - called unconventional geometric quantum computation leibfried03,unzhu , zheng , feng .",
    "the central idea of the unconventional geometric quantum computation is that for certain quantum evolution of a quantum system of interest one can implement fault - tolerant quantum computation by using the total phase accumulated in the evolution if it depends only on global geometric features of the evolution . in comparison with conventional geometric gates",
    ", unconventional geometric gates do not require additional operations to cancel the dynamical phases and thus simplify the realization operations .",
    "schemes for implementing the unconventional geometric gate have been proposed in trapped ion systems leibfried03,unzhu and in cavity qed systems@xcite . in the schemes of cavity qed systems@xcite , the excited states are utilized as the computational bases , thus the spontaneous emission can not be avoided in such schemes .    in this paper",
    "we make use of the two - channel raman interaction in cavity qed @xcite to realize the unconventional geometric gate . in our scheme the atomic excited states",
    "are adiabatically eliminated and never excited during the quantum gate construction , therefore atomic spontaneous emission can be avoided in our scheme .",
