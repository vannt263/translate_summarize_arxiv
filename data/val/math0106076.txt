    "work of abhyankar and kulkarni @xcite , bruns , conca , herzog , and trung @xcite showed that the computation of the hilbert series of ladder determinantal rings ( see section  [ sec:2 ] for precise definitions and background ) boils down to counting families of @xmath0 nonintersecting lattice paths with a given total number of turns in a certain ladder - shaped region .",

    "this solution is based on an explicit formula for the counting problem for one path ( i.e. , @xmath1 ) , which is then summed over a large set of indices with complicated dependencies .",

    "for example , when we implemented formula ( in _ mathematica _ ) it was by a factor of 40.000 ( ! ) faster than the corresponding implementation of formula .",
    "( indeed , the  simplicity \" of the formula in comparison to is deceptive , as involves an 11-fold summation in that case , whereas has only 3-fold , 4-fold , and 5-fold sums . ) of course , in the worst case , when @xmath72 consists of @xmath544-point pieces throughout , both methods are nothing else than plain counting , and therefore useless . for computation in case of such  fractal \" boundaries it is more promising to avoid theorem  [ thm:2 ] and instead try to extend the dummy path method in @xcite such that it also applies to the enumeration of nonintersecting lattice paths with respect to turns .",
