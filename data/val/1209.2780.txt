    "since their discovery @xcite , accreting x - ray pulsars have been prime targets for both observational and theoretical study @xcite .",
    "x - ray pulsars proved to be unique laboratories that allow to test a wide variety of physical processes in the presence of magnetic fields and strong gravity , and study stellar evolution in binary systems .    until recently ,",
    "the study of pulsating x - ray sources was limited to our galaxy and the nearby magellanic clouds .",
    "the advanced capabilities of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observatories opened the possibility to study spectral and timing properties of individual bright x - ray sources associated with more distant galaxies @xcite , allowing to extend searches for pulsating x - ray binaries beyond the milky way and its immediate neighbors .",
    "recent analysis of the monitoring observations with _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ has already led to the discovery of coherent pulsations in three x - ray sources located in the local group galaxy m31 @xcite and two x - ray pulsars in the nearby spiral galaxies ngc 2403 and ngc 1313 @xcite .",
    "two of the pulsating sources detected in m31 have supersoft spectra that can be fit with blackbody models with characteristic temperatures of several tens of ev , and probably belong to an accreting white dwarf systems .",
    "the remaining three objects have hard spectra with photon index @xmath5 , typical of systems containing accreting highly - magnetized neutron star .",
    "these results clearly demonstrate that bright ( @xmath6 ergs s@xmath4 ) pulsating x - ray source with both supersoft and hard spectra can be detected in the galaxies inside and beyond the local group up to the distances of a few mpc .    at the distance of 817 kpc @xcite ,",
    "the nearest late - type face - on spiral galaxy m33 provides a good opportunity to study x - ray sources associated with a young stellar population .",

    "the absence of a bright optical counterpart to xmmu j013359.5 + 303634 , its overall x - ray properties and positional coincidence with one of the major spiral arms in m 33 ( fig .",
    "[ image_general ] ) imply that it is not a galactic foreground object and almost certainly belongs to m33 .",
    "the x - ray pulsations and spectra of the source are consistent with an accreting highly magnetized neutron star in a binary system .    in the high - mass system scenario ,",
    "the 285.4 s pulse period places xmmu j013359.5 + 303634 squarely among be systems or underfilled roche lobe supergiant systems on the corbet diagram @xcite",
    ". the transient behavior of the source strongly favors the be x - ray binary interpretation , in which the x - ray outbursts are attributed to either periastron passages of the compact companion ( type i outbursts ) or changes in the be star circumstellar disk that might occur at any binary phase ( type ii outbursts ) @xcite .",
    "possible optical counterparts to xmmu j013359.5 + 303634 are all fainter than 20 mag in the v band ( table [ lgs_counterparts ] ) , with absolute @xmath17 magnitudes between @xmath18 and @xmath19 at 817 kpc , supporting the be system identification , but not ruling out a supergiant system with a luminosity class ii companion .",
    "in addition , the brightest optical object located within the error circle of xmmu j013359.5 + 303634 has properties consistent with being an early b v star and possibly belonging to the be class . assuming the distance of 817 kpc , the absorption - corrected @xmath8 kev x - ray luminosity of xmmu j013359.5 + 303634 measured in the jul .",
    "9 - 12 observations ( @xmath20 ergs s@xmath4 ) also falls within the range observed for be x - ray binary pulsars and exceeds typical luminosities observed in the wind - fed supergiant systems @xcite .    if xmmu j013359.5 + 303634 is indeed a be system , its binary period , @xmath21 estimated from the corbet diagram falls in the @xmath22 day range . the observed time span between _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations when the source was detected allows to put an additional limit on the orbital period . assuming that a single type i outburst was observed and that it was lasting less than one orbital cycle requires @xmath23 days .",
    "another possibility is that xmmu j013359.5 + 303634 is a transient low - mass binary system @xcite . in that scenario ,",
    "the transient outbursts could be explained as a result of a viscous - thermal instability of the quiescent accretion disk .",
    "the relatively long pulsation period of the source almost certainly excludes low - mass short orbital period systems . on the other hand ,",
    "the possibility of a very long period system with red giant companion similar to the galactic source gx 1 + 4 @xcite can not be completely ruled out , since the expected brightness of the red giant companion ( @xmath24 mag ) does not exceed the brightness of the individual optical objects detected within the error circle of xmmu j013359.5 + 303634 .",
    "although most of the observed properties of xmmu j013359.5 + 303634 favor a be / x - ray binary identification , a proper optical identification is essential to determine the actual nature of the system . to facilitate it , deeper high - resolution optical observations of the source region",
    "are needed along with an improved x - ray position measurement .",
    "regular monitoring x - ray observations of the central region of m33 have a potential to detect new outbursts from xmmu j013359.5 + 303634 , improve source localization and put constraints on its orbital parameters .",
    "the number of x - ray pulsar candidates with non - supersoft spectra located outside our own galaxy and magellanic clouds is still very small with only four such systems known so far , including xmmu j013359.5 + 303634 .",
    "all of them were discovered as transient sources with x - ray luminosities in the @xmath25 ergs s@xmath4 range , and probably belong to a luminous be / x - ray binary class . because of their higher mass transfer rates , luminous x - ray pulsars are ideal laboratories to study effects of angular momentum transfer and interaction between pulsar magnetosphere and the accretion flow through the evolution of their pulsation periods @xcite .",
    "analysis of the pulse profiles and spectral properties of these objects can provide extremely valuable information on the accretion flow and magnetic field geometry , neutron star compactness and emission properties @xcite .",
    "the discovery of xmmu j013359.5 + 303634 is yet another demonstration that monitoring observations with current x - ray missions can detect these and similar pulsating sources ( both transient and persistent ) in the galaxies located up to a few mpc away .",
    "observations of nearby galaxies allow us to monitor a significantly bigger x - ray source population when compared to just our own galaxy and its immediate neighbors . in the galaxies with recent and ongoing star formation",
    ", x - ray pulsars should constitute a sizable fraction of the total x - ray source population , with some of them expected to be bright enough ( @xmath26 ergs s@xmath4 ) for detection by current instruments , opening a way to significantly increase the statistics of luminous x - ray pulsars .",
    "the author would like to thank the referee for comments and suggestions that helped to improve the paper .",
