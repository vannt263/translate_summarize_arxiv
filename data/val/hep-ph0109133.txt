    "severe constrains on the possibility of baryon symmetrical universe ( see review in [ 1 - 3 ] ) , as well as the evident baryon asymmetry of our cosmic neighborhood , related in the modern cosmology to the process of baryosynthesis in the very early universe ( [ 4 ] , see e.g.[5 ] for review ) , do not exclude the existence of relatively small amount of sufficiently large regions of antimatter in the modern universe , reflecting the nontrivial physical processes , underlying inflation and baryosynthesis .",
    "the original idea [ 6,3,5 ] to consider antimatter in the baryon asymmetrical universe as the tracer for the strong nonhomogeneity of baryosynthesis finds support in recently developed inflationary models with nonhomogeneous spontaneous baryosynthesis [ 7 ] .",
    "such models reproduce in quantitative way both the possibility of diffused antiworld ( regions of very low density antiproton - positron plasma ) [ 8 ] and the hypothesis on the existence of antimatter stars in our galaxy [ 9 ] .",
    "the both possibilities satisfy the severe constrains on matter - antimatter annihilation [ 1 - 3 ] . in particular , the antimatter globular cluster as the possible form of antimatter in our galaxy is consistent with that constrains , since the substantial growth of annihilation zone and depletion zone at matter - antimatter boundary at redshift @xmath5 was found in [ 1 ] for the case of large domains in baryon symmetrical universe . according to [ 1 ]",
    "this result is not applicable to the case of small ( about @xmath6 ) relative volume , occupied by antimatter in baryon - asymmetrical universe , when the size of antimatter domains , surviving to the present time , is determined as in [ 8 ] . at the enhanced density of antibaryons in domain it provides formation of globular cluster of antimatter stars [ 9 ] .",
    "moreover , it was shown recently [ 10 ] that annihilation of antimatter , lost by antimatter stars in the form of stellar wind , can reproduce the observed galactic gamma background in the range tens - hundreds mev . still any source of neutral pions can lead to the same effect and the manifest signature for existence of antimatter stars is the existence of antinuclear component of cosmic rays , accessible to the future cosmic ray experimental searches , first of all in ams - ii experiment .",
    "the other profound signature of antimatter are the pieces of antimatter , coming in the form of antimatter meteorites .",
    "we study the latter possibility in the present paper and find it interesting tool to probe the origin of matter , related with the creation of antimatter . with all the uncertainties and reservations , taken into account , the search for antimatter meteorites can still provide the useful probe for the existence of macroscopic antimatter .",
    "the present flux of meteorites with the mass @xmath7 observed on the earth is nearly @xmath8 event a year .",
    "this power extend for a large range of mass values .",
    "it is very possible that most of this matter has a local `` solar '' origin .",
    "however simple argument on nearby stellar encounters and matter exchange imply that up to 1% of the meteorites may be of galactic ( extra - solar ) origin .",
    "therefore up to nearly @xmath9 of meteorites , hitting the earth any year , can be of galactic ( extra - solar ) nature . if the corresponding antimeteorites rate follows the same power law , at any given suppressed ratio , @xmath10 , @xmath11 where @xmath12 the total amount of antibaryons ( baryons ) in the galaxy , ( let say a part over a million or a billion or below ) its signal will be anyway power - full enough to be ( in most cases ) observable .",
    "indeed the amount of energy released during the annihilation follows common special relativity ; for any light ( milligram unit ) anti - meteorites mass @xmath7 the energy ejected is : @xmath13 its corresponding `` galactic '' event rate , following eq.(1 ) is @xmath14 the event of the anti - meteorite annihilation on the earth atmosphere will give life to unexpected upward gamma shower that will mimic mini nuclear atomic test or extreme upward gamma shower .",
    "even for a large suppression ratio @xmath15 this event rate derived from expression above ( one a year ) should not escape the accurate batse ten - year monitoring .",
    "actually the atmosphere area below batse detection is nearly 1% of all earth leading to a total probability rate of 0.1 in ten years .",
    "however the corresponding secondaries gamma flux by consequent nuclei annihilation showering into charged and neutral pion and their decays and degradation in atmosphere should lead to a huge gamma fluence @xmath16 observable in a near orbit satellite as beppo - sax or gro batse : @xmath17 @xmath18 this latter flux is derived assuming a characteristic galactic velocity v= 300 km / sec for the incoming anti - meteorite and a terrestrial atmosphere of nearly 30 km height .",
    "such a signal is nearly 10 order of magnitude above the sensitive batse detection threshold .",
    "smaller scale upward gamma flash are indeed known and they are called `` terrestrial gamma flashes '' .",
    "they are corresponding to just @xmath19 or @xmath20 erg of isotropic fluence energy ( or even much less energy if originated by beamed upward @xmath21 airshowers at @xmath22 up to nearly horizontal ones at @xmath23 @xcite ) released at millisecond up to ten of second timescales .",
    "therefore such milligram anti - meteorite bang will be already loudly recorded on data , if they were taking place .",
    "of course so high large event fluence would not escape also other less sensitive astrophysical or military detectors .",
    "therefore it seem that milligram antimatter meteorite rain should be totally excluded at very low level ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "even more dramatic and sharp gamma signature should come by their fast moon annihilation ( because of the absence of atmosphere ) , but at a less ( moon surface over earth one ) rate .",
    "lunar anti - meteorite annihilation in characteristic nano - second signature , would make very strong signals at lunar orbiting gamma detectors .",
    "they provide a complementary tool to exclude very light ( micro - gram ) antimeteorite rains at the same severe bound ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "however these results may be alleviated keeping in mind that antimeteorites can be annihilated or `` evaporated '' during their propagation in galactic gas .",
    "indeed the column density of atoms ( protons ) crossed assuming @xmath25 and a galactic disk height of @xmath26 pc and a total number of crossing 100 is : @xmath27 @xmath28 .",
    "each crossed matter atom annihilates on the surface of the rigid body of anti - meteorite . putting the total mass of the crossed matter gas equal to the mass of spherical homogeneous antimeteorite of radius @xmath10 and internal density @xmath29 ,",
    "@xmath30 one obtains that the antimeteorite can not escape complete annihilation , if its radius is smaller , than @xmath31 and the corresponding meteorite mass , given by @xmath32 is ( assuming water density ) about @xmath33 g. the actual value of minimal mass of the antimeteorite , surviving annihilation , may be a few orders of magnitude larger . if we take into account the strong ( cubic ) dependence of @xmath34 on @xmath35 , we find important the increase of @xmath35 due to effects of annihilation with the gas above the disc",
    ". the mass of antimeteorite , which is completely destroyed by annihilation , can be even larger , if we take into account its atomic composition . to destroy the antimeteorite , which consists of anti - atoms with atomic number @xmath36 , it is not necessary to annihilate all the anti - nucleons in all its antinuclei , since even the result of one proton anti - nucleus annihilation not only destroys the anti - nucleus , but also causes the successive destructive effects by its fragments .",
    "we discuss the effects of energy and momentum transfer due to such processes in the next section , and only estimate here the increase in the minimal mass of anti - meteorite , surviving after annihilation .",
    "putting the total number of matter gas atoms , annihilating on the surface of anti - meteorite , equal to the total number of anti - atoms with atomic number @xmath36 in antimeteorite , we obtain instead of @xmath34 the magnitude @xmath37 which is the factor of @xmath38 larger , than @xmath34 .",
    "this imply that milligram ( and even much heavier , up to @xmath39 g for anti - ice meteorite ) antimeteorites might be suppressed and maybe almost absent in solar system ; previous bound by annihilation on the earth may be considered for heavier ( 10 - 100 milligram or above ) anti - meteorites leading to a ratio ( @xmath40 ) of antimatter allowable .",
    "bounds by microgram anti - meteorite annihilation on moon soil while being very hard and sharp , will be no more effective than the terrestrial bounds",
    ". moreover , there are other processes that may dilute above antimeteorite presence in our solar system .",
    "antimeteorite with a mass heavier than milligram may survive annihilation : however while crossing a gas cloud , their lateral annihilation may heat a meteorite side , leading to a rocket ejection able to decelerate and at large matter gas density gradient even divert and bounce the trajectory .",
    "however , for realistic density gradients the latter case can not be realized and the momentum transfer due to annihilation causes the antimeteorite deceleration in matter gas , which can be described as follows .",
    "antimetorite of radius @xmath10 , moving with a velocity @xmath41 in the central field of gas , distributed around the central mass @xmath7 isotropically as @xmath42 experiences the friction force due to annihilation    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the effectiveness of momentum transfer near unity ; assuming an initial anti - meteorite velocity @xmath45 and density @xmath46 and a normal galactic - disk mass density @xmath47 one finds the characteristic relaxation time @xmath21 ( for a millimeter anti - meteorite radius ) :    @xmath48    @xmath49    therefore in a short ( in galactic scales ) times any fast anti - meteorite will be slow down to a velocity comparable with common galactic gas .",
    "therefore lightest anti - meteorite will follow a co - moving pattern with matter in galactic disk .",
    "heavier ones ( m @xmath50 g ) will not evaporate and might reach the earth . in presence of any radial gravitational force , near stars or star clusters , the gravitational force @xmath51 and",
    "the friction action leads to a slow - down free fall up to a steady value .",
    "the equality of the two forces indeed leads to the constant velocity @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the schwarchild radius of any central body .",
    "the annihilation friction is effective , resulting in the anti - meteorite deceleration and successive slow drift and final annihilation towards the star center .    in nearly horizontal motions",
    "the fast anti - meteorite may bounce on the star - planet atmosphere and they may escape from the central field . in the case of general motion and matter gas distribution this effect",
    "may be estimated by assuming that a fraction of antimatter is annihilated leading to a momentum exchange ( see @xcite ) and a velocity loss @xmath54 :    @xmath55    where @xmath44 is the fraction of annihilation energy going into effective anti - asteroid momentum exchange . being necessary to escape from the galactic plane or from solar atmosphere a @xmath56 one finds    @xmath57    this value can not exceed unity otherwise the anti - meteorite will be totally annihilated ; therefore the @xmath44 efficiency can not be below @xmath58 but its value is bounded by the ratio of the interaction length of charged pions on the meteorite volume ; the 300 mev pion crosses nearly 85 cm in water before interacting ; the total amount of matter crossed during meteorite life - time traveling ( comparable to galactic age ) in the galactic disk is nearly @xmath59 g or @xmath59 cm . of water .",
    "however in the case of atomic antinuclei composition annihilating with hydrogen of galactic gas the main consequence will be a breakdown of antinuclei .",
    "its fragments will deposit in a very efficient way ( nearly 50% ) the energy of annihilation into linear momentum as well as increasing the temperature of the solid antimatter body .",
    "our first estimation show that the effective cooling is keeping the temperature below the solid ( rock ) melting point , while the antimeteorite moves in the galaxy and solar system .",
    "the equilibrium temperature is established , provided that the heating rate @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 is the fraction of the total energy , released in the annihilation ( @xmath62 ) ) , that heats the spherically symmetric antimeteorite of radius @xmath10 , moving with velocity @xmath41 in the matter gas of density @xmath63 ) is equal to the rate of radiative cooling @xmath64 ( where @xmath65 is the stephan - boltzmann constant ) . in the considered approximation",
    "both heating and cooling are proportional to the surface area , so that the equilibrium temperature is given by @xmath66 for matter gas number density @xmath67 @xmath68 and anti - meteorite velocity v @xmath69 km / s .",
    "annihilation of matter gas with antinuclei on the antimeteorite surface leads to its erosion , but its effect , which may deserve special analysis for particular antimeteorite composition , does not lead to significant change of the above estimation for sufficiently large antimeteorites .",
    "nevertheless the `` ice '' anti - comets might be melt efficiently still in the galaxy and very efficiently near solar and terrestial atmosphere .",
    "the reason is that the estimated value of @xmath70 can easily be factor of 2 larger , but the antimeteorite , moving with the velocity @xmath71 , with the account for all the uncertainties can be hardly heated up to 1000 k due to the annihilation in the low density matter gas ( with the number density @xmath72 .",
    "the equilibium condition , rewritten for energy density of radiation ( @xmath73 ) and of annihilation products ( @xmath74 ) in the form @xmath75 , is reached at @xmath76k due to the low values of in - flow velocity @xmath71 and matter gas density @xmath77 , what compensates the large value of annihilation energy release @xmath78 .",
    "the `` galactic anti - asteroid '' rate on sun from ( 1 ) is @xmath79 the consequent event rate for suppressed anti- asteroids one over a billion is 10 events a year .",
    "the fluence @xmath16 on earth is @xmath80 and comparable to grb fluence , with a time dilution of nearly 10 seconds",
    ". therefore it may be well be missed or misunderstood as a low energy solar flare .",
    "the rarest events at 100 g range may mimic observed solar flares . let us remind that present bounds in solar flare activity may be even detectable at a nano - flare intensity . if the above coincidence is not just the hint of the antimatter meteorites in - fall it provides the present most stringent bound on antimatter",
    ". it may be useful to mention that the two anti - meteorite searches undertaken in ussr in late 1960-s early 1970-s , even with no confirmation , exhibited the positive effect ( [ 13 ] , see review in [ 14 ] ) .",
    "so not only stringent limits , but even positive discoveries should be in principle considered in future of such searches .",
    "anti - meteorites annihilations may provide the challenge to search for antimatter in our galaxy at the same level of sensitivity which is planned to be reached in ams - ii experiment ( a part over a billion ) .",
    "with all the uncertainty in possible relationship between the total mass of antimatter stars and the expected amount of pieces of antimatter to be ejected by antimatter stellar systems and all the possible reservations our first estimate on earth and solar events are showing rather high sensitivity ( @xmath81 ) in antimatter search can or even might be already reached .",
    "the work was partially performed in the framework of russian state contract @xmath82 , with partial support of cosmion - ethz , ams - epcos collaborations , of grant @xmath83 of support for russian scientific schools , rfbr grant @xmath84 and of grant of russian universities .",
