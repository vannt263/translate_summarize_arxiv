    "it is well - known that there are two fundamental features of an electromagnetic superconductor , the zero resistance and the perfect diamagnetism .",
    "the latter is also called meissner effect@xcite . the key quantity describing the meissner effect",
    "is the meissner mass or penetration depth . in the language of gauge field theory ,",
    "the meissner mass is the mass of the electromagnetic field obtained through the spontaneous breaking of local @xmath0 gauge symmetry , i.e. , the anderson - higgs mechanism@xcite .",
    "recently , the study on superconductivity is extended to color @xmath1 gauge field of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at finite temperature and baryon density@xcite .    in the linear response theory ,",
    "the meissner effect is defined in the static and long wave limit @xmath2 of the external magnetic potential @xmath3 . from the microscopic bcs theory",
    "the electric current density can be expressed as @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are respectively the mass , electric charge , momentum and density of electrons , @xmath7 is the quasi - particle energy with electric chemical potential @xmath8 and energy gap @xmath9 , and @xmath10 the fermion distribution function . since @xmath11 , the second term in the bracket on the right hand side is a paramagnetic one and cancels partially the diamagnetism characterized by the first term .",
    "however , the total meissner mass squared keeps positive in normal superconductor with bcs pairing mechanism . at zero temperature , due to the limit @xmath12 , the second term in ( [ jq ] ) disappears automatically , and",
    "there is no paramagnetic part .",
    "in addition to the perfect diamagnetism , the meissner effect includes also the property of magnetic flux expulsion upon cooling through the critical temperature corresponding to the thermodynamic critical field .",
    "another quantity to describe the magnetization property of a superconductor is the spin susceptibility .",
    "since an electron carries a bohr magneton , a cold free electron gas exhibits pauli paramagnetism@xcite .",
    "however , at zero temperature the spin susceptibility @xmath13 of a metallic superconductor is zero , it does not possess pauli paramagnetism .",
    "the physical picture is clear : the two electrons in a cooper pair carry opposite spin . from the microscopic bcs theory ,",
    "the spin susceptibility of a superconductor can be written as@xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the pauli susceptibility of a normal electron gas , and @xmath16 the electron energy at the fermi surface . due to the above mentioned limit of @xmath17 ,",
    "the spin susceptibility of bcs type superconductor is zero at @xmath18 . at finite temperature ,",
    "@xmath13 is nonzero because of the thermo excitation in the superconductor .",
    "the above discussed diamagnetic meissner mass and zero spin susceptibility are only for normal bcs superconductor where the two fermions participating in a cooper pair are symmetric , i.e. , they have the same chemical potential , the same mass , and in turn the same fermi surface . in many physical cases , however , the difference in chemical potentials , or number densities , or masses of the two kinds of fermions results in mismatched fermi surfaces .",
    "such physical systems can be realized in , for instance , a superconductor in an external magnetic field@xcite or a strong spin - exchange field@xcite , an electronic gas with two species of electrons from different bands@xcite , a superconductor with overlapping bands@xcite , a system of trapped ions with dipolar interactions@xcite , a mixture of two species of fermionic cold atoms with different densities and/or masses@xcite , an isospin asymmetric nuclear matter with proton - neutron pairing@xcite , and a neutral quark matter in dense qcd@xcite . in the study on superconductivity in an external magnetic field",
    ", sarma @xcite found an interesting spatial uniform state where there exist gapless modes .",
    "however , compared with the fully gapped bcs state , the sarma state is energetically unfavored and therefore instable .",
    "a spatial non - uniform ground state where the order parameter has crystalline structure was also proposed for such type of superconductors by fulde and ferrell and larkin and ovchinnikov , the so - called loff state . in this ground state ,",
    "the translational and the rotational symmetries of the system are spontaneously broken .",
    "recently , the above spatial uniform ground state prompted new interest due to the work of liu and wilczek@xcite .",
    "they considered a system of two species of fermions with a large mass difference .",
    "the stability of the state has been discussed in many papers@xcite .",
    "it is now accepted that the sarma instability can be avoided by two possible ways , finite difference in number densities of the two species@xcite or a proper momentum structure of the attractive interaction between fermions@xcite . in these states ,",
    "the dispersion relation of one branch of the quasi - particles has two zero points at momenta @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and at these two points it needs no energy for quasi - particle excitations .",
    "the superfluid fermi liquid phase in the regions @xmath21 and @xmath22 is breached by a normal fermi liquid phase in the region @xmath23 .",
    "the temperature behavior of such a breached pairing ( bp ) state is very different from that of a bcs state , the temperature corresponding to the maximum gap is not zero but finite@xcite .",
    "since the dispersion relation controls the meissner mass and the spin susceptibility , as shown above , it is natural to guess that the change in @xmath24 in breached pairing superconductor will modify the meissner effect and spin susceptibility significantly .",
    "recently , it is found that the meissner mass squared of some gluons in two flavor neutral color superconductor are negative@xcite , which indicates that the quark matter in breached pairing state exhibits a paramagnetic meissner effect ( pme ) . in condensed matter physics , pme",
    "was observed first in high temperature superconductors such as ceramic samples of @xmath25@xcite , and later in conventional superconductors such as nb@xcite .",
    "it was suggested that the paramagnetic response might be a manifestation of @xmath26-wave superconductivity@xcite .",
    "however , it seems that it is not necessarily to do anything with the @xmath26-wave analysis for the pme in conventional superconductors@xcite .",
    "it is now widely accepted that the pme in these materials is most likely due to extrinsic mesoscopic or nanoscale disorder@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the meissner effect and spin susceptibility in an asymmetric two - component fermion system in nonrelativistic case , and try to prove that the meissner effect and spin susceptibility of a superconductor is dominated by the pairing mechanism , and the paramagnetism and nonzero spin susceptibility are universal phenomena of superconductors with mismatched fermi surfaces .",
    "we will model the pairing interaction by a four - fermion point coupling , which is appropriate for both electronic system , cold fermionic atom gas , nuclear matter and dense quark matter .",
    "since our purpose is a general analysis for the meissner effect and magnetization property , we will neglect the inner structures of fermions like spin , isospin , flavor , and color , which are important and bring much abundance while are not central for pairing .",
