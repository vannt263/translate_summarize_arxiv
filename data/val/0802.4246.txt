    "manipulation of discrete quantum states has long held interest , most recently for application to quantum information processing @xcite . in the simplest realizations one deals with a nondegenerate two - state system ( a two - level atom@xcite ) and through pulsed resonant coherent excitation",
    "produces a specified superposition of the two states , starting from a single state . following the availability of laser light sources , much attention centered on producing complete excitation , i.e. complete population transfer from the ground state to an excited state @xcite .",
    "more recently interest has shifted to the production of specific superpositions of the two states , and to producing transitions between superposition states . in the context of quantum information a two - state system serves as a qubit ; more general tasks involve multiple quantum states ( a qunit ) , possibly driven by pulsed nonresonant light .",
    "the goal of quantum - state manipulation is to realign the statevector @xmath1 from some given hilbert - space direction @xmath2 at an initial time @xmath3 to some prescribed state @xmath4 at a final time @xmath5 , each of these statevectors being defined by the set of complex - valued probability amplitudes @xmath6 associated with a set of quantum states @xmath7 .",
    "expressed in matrix form , the goal is to obtain a propagator matrix @xmath8 that transforms the vector @xmath9 of components @xmath10 , @xmath11    as noted in the following section , there exists an extensive literature describing analytic solutions to the two - state system for a variety of pulsed - excitation scenarios .",
    "there exist also numerous analytic solutions to multistate systems .    here",
    "we consider , as a particular generalization of the two - state system , a two - level system involving two sets of degenerate sublevels : a less energetic set of @xmath12 states @xmath13 with common energy @xmath14 ( the _ lower _ set ) , and a more energetic set of @xmath15 states @xmath16 that share energy @xmath17 ( the _ upper _ set ) .",
    "thus we consider a hilbert space of dimension @xmath18 . for definiteness",
    "we here assume that @xmath19 .",
    "we assume that interactions produced by laser fields can induce direct transitions between lower sublevels and upper sublevels , but not directly within either manifold of states ( i.e. we allow electric - dipole transitions only ) .    because the statevector has unit length at all times , any such change can be regarded as a rotation , and any allowable motion in several dimensions can be decomposed into a succession of two - dimensional rotations , analogous to the three euler angles that define an arbitrary rotation in euclidean space .",
    "however , length - preserving changes in multi - dimensional space can also be produced by a succession of reflections . when expressed in matrix form",
    "these are generalizations of the householder reflections used in matrix calculus @xcite .",
    "as has been shown previously , such unitary operations can be implemented very efficiently using coherent excitation techniques @xcite ; as subsequently noted @xcite , the use of quantum householder reflections ( qhr ) permits efficient quantum - state engineering of transitions between arbitrary superpositions .",
    "the qhr implementation proposed earlier @xcite requires a particular multistate linkage pattern , in which a set of @xmath12 low - lying degenerate states all link , via radiative interaction , with a _ single _ upper state  a generalization of the tripod linkage termed an _ n - pod_.",
    "such a linkage pattern occurs with a lower level having angular momentum @xmath20 ( three sublevels ) excited to an upper level having @xmath21 ( a single sublevel ) but the pattern is difficult to realize for more than 3 lower states .",
    "it is therefore desirable to extend the qhr technique to more general linkage patterns .",
    "the present manuscript describes a procedure that allows implementation of the qhr when there are multiple states in the upper set .",
    "such an extension makes possible the application of qhr to arbitrary angular momentum states , as occur with free atoms and molecules . as we show , the propagator for such situations is not a single qhr , but a product of qhrs , moreover with orthogonal vectors .",
    "the expression for the resulting propagator has a clear geometric interpretation as the effect of a succession of reflections , i.e. _ coupled mirrors_.    the key to this extension of the qhr is a transformation of the underlying basis states , the so - called morris - shore ( ms ) transformation @xcite .",
    "this replaces the original system , with its multiple linkages between states , by a set of independent nondegenerate two - state systems , thereby allowing us to utilize the considerable literature of analytic solutions to two - state systems and produce analytic solutions for degenerate multistate systems @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present the solution of the degenerate two - level problem in a simple closed form involving sums of projectors of ms states .",
    "these expressions are useful for deriving analytical solutions , generalizations of known two - state solutions , for systems having degenerate levels . for certain conditions , wherein the transition probabilities between states from different sets vanish , the propagator for states of the lower set is given by a product of qhrs with orthogonal vectors , each vector being a bright state ; a similar property applies to the upper set .",
    "we discuss properties of this novel geometric object , the coupled mirrors . to illustrate the procedure we develop a useful explicit analytic formalism for two upper states and present some examples .",
    "we consider the controlled alteration of a multistate system , expressed as a redirection of the statevector , induced by a set of laser pulses .",
    "the simplest example of coherent excitation occurs when there are just two nondegenerate states , indexed 1 and 2 .",
    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation prescribes the changes in hilbert space as ( here and henceforth we set @xmath22 , thereby making no distinction between energy and frequency units ) @xmath23where the column vector @xmath9 has the complex - valued probability amplitudes @xmath6 as elements , @xmath24^t$ ] .",
    "commonly one neglects in the hamiltonian @xmath25 elements that vary rapidly compared with the characteristic response times of the system , the so - called rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) @xcite .",
    "then the hamiltonian matrix , with suitable choice of energy zero - point , reads @xmath26 .\\]]here the slowly - varying function @xmath27 , the rabi frequency , quantifies the coupling between the two states . for a laser - driven electric - dipole transition in an atom or a molecule",
    ", @xmath27 is proportional to the transition dipole moment and the electric - field envelope .",
    "the detuning @xmath28 measures the frequency offset of the carrier laser frequency @xmath29 from the bohr transition frequency @xmath30 , @xmath31 . a time dependence in the detuning can be introduced by both @xmath29 ( due to chirping @xcite ) and @xmath30 ( due to stark and zeeman shifts ) .    when the transition is exactly resonant the associated detuning vanishes , @xmath32 .",
    "then the response depends only upon the initial conditions and upon the time - integrated rabi frequency ( the temporal pulse area ) , @xmath33 at all times the probability amplitudes are expressible as trigonometric functions of @xmath34 ; when @xmath34 is some even - integer multiple of @xmath35 ( e.g. , a @xmath36 _ _  _ _ pulse ) , the probabilities repeat their initial values . thus the response , for resonant excitation ,",
    "does not depend on any details of the pulse shape .",
    "of particular use are the @xmath35 pulses , which produce complete population inversion between the two states , and half-@xmath35 pulses that create an equal coherent superposition of the two states .",
    "resonant pulses having precise temporal area have had wide application , most notably in nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite and coherent atomic excitation @xcite .",
    "they are now a common tool in quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "a variety of nonresonant ( @xmath37 ) pulses also lead to exact analytic expressions for the probability amplitudes @xmath38 and @xmath39 . amongst",
    "the soluble two - state models are the models of rabi @xcite , landau - zener @xcite , rosen - zener @xcite , allen - eberly @xcite , bambini - berman @xcite , demkov - kunike @xcite , demkov @xcite , nikitin @xcite , and carroll - hioe @xcite .",
    "methods for approximate solutions are also available , such as the perturbation theory , the adiabatic approximation @xcite , the magnus approximation @xcite , and the dykhne - davis - pechukas approximation @xcite .",
    "the latter , in particular , is a very useful tool for deriving very accurate approximations in various cases of interest , e.g. , transform - limited @xcite and chirped gaussian pulses @xcite .",
    "the two - state dynamics acquires interesting new features when the pulsed field possesses some symmetries @xcite , or when it is a sequence of identical pulses ( pulse train ) @xcite .",
    "the two - state atom provides a very basic model of coherent excitation , widely used because of the relative simplicity with which it can be treated mathematically and fabricated experimentally .",
    "however , with this mastery has come interest in more general systems , involving more than two discrete quantum states .",
    "it is with a class of these that the present paper deals .",
    "specifically , we describe a straightforward technique that allows efficient redirection of the statevector for such a system by means of laser pulses , and the use of the many exact and approximate solutions available for two - state systems .",
    "an important extension is the linear chain of @xmath0 states , each state being linked only to its nearest neighbor .",
    "the simplest of this is the three - state chain , involving two independent pulses , the mathematics of which has been extensively reported @xcite , as have lengthier chains @xcite . here",
    "we consider an extension in which each of the states of the two - state system is replaced by a degenerate set of states that together form an energy _",
    "level_. such situations occur commonly when one deals with angular - momentum eigenstates , as happens with the electronic structure of atoms in free space . for a given angular momentum @xmath40",
    "there are @xmath41 magnetic sublevels that , in the absence of an external electric or magnetic field , all have the same energy .",
    "we shall consider the possibility that there be no nonzero elements of the hamiltonian matrix linking any states of the same energy ; nonzero couplings occur only between states from the lower set and the states in the upper set .",
    "we make no restriction on the number of states that connect with any single state .",
    "this generalizes the usual situation of angular momentum states excited by electric - dipole radiation , when any state can link to no more than three other states ( the selection rules @xmath42 ) .",
    "figure [ fig - link ] illustrates the linkage pattern we consider .",
    "we shall assume that we can control the magnitude and the phase of each interaction ( e.g. each electric field envelope ) , and that _ every rabi frequency has the same time dependence _ , which we write as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a complex - valued constant and @xmath45 a real - valued pulse - shaped function of time bounded by unity . we assume that the duration of the pulse is shorter than any decoherence time , so that the dynamics is governed by the schrdinger equation .",
    "such is the situation for excitations of free atoms and molecules by picosecond or femtosecond pulses @xcite .",
    "we shall also assume that each transition has exactly the same detuning @xmath46 .",
    "in the simplest situations , those associated with angular - momentum states , three distinct fields can be distinguished by their polarization , while sharing a common carrier frequency . by utilizing three independent polarization directions of a laser pulse",
    "we can ensure three linkages with common time dependence .",
    "more general linkage patterns , still within the model described here , are also possible @xcite .",
    "in the rwa the schrdinger equation provides a prescription for the time dependence of the probability amplitudes @xmath6 .",
    "written in matrix form it is @xmath47 where the column vector @xmath9 has @xmath6 as elements .",
    "we shall arrange these elements with those of the lower set first , followed by the upper set .",
    "then the rwa hamiltonian has the block structure @xmath48 here @xmath49 denotes the @xmath12-dimensional square null matrix ; the zeros signify that the lower states do not interact with each other and that they all have the same energy , which we take as the zero - point of our energy scale .",
    "the matrix @xmath50 is an @xmath51-dimensional matrix whose elements @xmath52 are the magnitudes of the couplings between the lower and the upper states ; @xmath53 is its hermitian conjugate .",

    "we allow the detuning @xmath28 to vary with time , bearing in mind use of known analytic solutions to the two - state model with frequency - swept detuning .",

    "we have here extended the earlier work on qhr in hilbert space to allow more general linkage patterns between the quantum states , with particular attention to degenerate sublevels that occur with angular momentum states .",
    "the extension relies on the use of the morris - shore transformation to reduce the original multi - linkage hamiltonian to a set of independent two - state systems , thereby allowing the utilization of various known two - state analytic solutions . such solutions , when expressed in terms of cayley - klein parameters , readily lead to conditions upon the pulse areas and the time - varying detunings of the excitation pulses .",
    "we have found that the propagator within the lower ( or upper ) set of degenerate states represents coupled quantum - state mirrors .",
    "the realization of these coupled qhrs within the lower ( or upper ) set of states requires certain conditions on the interaction parameters , specifically that all transition probabiities between the lower and upper sets must vanish .",
    "we have proposed three physical realizations of this condition : with resonant , near - resonant ( hyperbolic - secant ) , and far - off - resonant pulses .",
    "resonant and near - resonant pulses provide exactly zero transition probabilities , but offer less flexibility in the qhr phases @xmath170 ; moreover they require a carefully chosen pulse area in each ms two - state system , which leads to a number of conditions on the interaction parameters .",
    "far - off - resonant pulses fulfill the zero - probability conditions only approximately , but offer much more flexibility",
    ". then the only restriction is for sufficiently large detuning , without specific constraints on pulse areas , because the zero - probability conditions are fulfilled simultaneously in all ms two - state systems .    for angular - momentum states ,",
    "there are six independent interaction parameters : three polarization amplitudes , two relative phases between different polarizations , and the common detuning .",
    "therefore the constructed qhr has six free parameters ( with the far - off - resonance realization ) . for a more general linkage",
    ", the number of independent parameters can be much larger .",
    "in a subsequent paper @xcite , we shall describe the mathematical aspects of this largely unknown operator of coupled reflections , which however , as we have shown here , arises naturally in quantum systems .",
    "in particular , we shall show how one can factorize , and therefore synthesize , an arbitrary u(@xmath0 ) propagator by such objects .",
    "the procedure is more efficient than a set of rotations that would produce the same transformation .",
    "we conclude by pointing out that the confinement of the statevector evolution to the lower set of states , and the availability of simple and efficient tools for its engineering , such as coupled qhrs , can be an essential ingredient for decoherence - free quantum computing @xcite .",
