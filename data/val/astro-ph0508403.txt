    "galaxies are major structural components of our universe , yet their formation and evolution remain an outstanding mystery of contemporary astrophysics . the latest generation of telescopes , including _ keck _ , _ subaru _ , the _ very large telescope _ , _ gemini _ , and the _ hubble space telescope _ ,",
    "provide snapshots of galaxies at various redshifts .",
    "the properties of disk galaxies out to @xmath0 have been the subject of several recent studies .",
    "these properties include the tully - fisher relation ( e.g. @xcite ) , the luminosity - size , magnitude - size , and mass - size relations ( e.g. @xcite ) , the size distribution ( e.g. @xcite ) and the disk  thickness \" ( @xcite , hereafter rdc , @xcite ) .",
    "the evolution of the luminosity - size and mass - size relations of disk galaxies remains a controversial issue .",
    "in particular , the interpretation of such evolution depends acutely on the selection biases of the surveys .",
    "several studies have found an increase in the @xmath1-band surface brightness of @xmath2  mag  arcsec@xmath3 , out to redshift 1 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "taking into account selection effects @xcite found minimal evolution with redshift , work that was supported by @xcite , who found that the luminosity - size relation evolves by less than 0.4  mag  arcsec@xmath4 between @xmath5 and @xmath6 . yet these groups invoke a population of high redshift , high surface brightness galaxies in their interpretation .",
    "different interpretations of completeness have resulted in @xcite and @xcite finding an evolution in the rest frame @xmath7-band surface brightness of @xmath8 and @xmath9  mag  arcsec@xmath3 out to @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "@xcite also find that disks at a given absolute magnitude are bluer , with lower stellar mass to light ratios at @xmath12 , resulting in weak evolution in the relation between stellar mass and disk size .",
    "rdc selected 34 edge - on disk galaxies in the h_ubble deep field _ with apparent diameters larger than 1.3  and unperturbed morphology .",
    "they found an evolution between distant and local disk galaxies in their relative thickness or flatness , as characterized by the ratio of scale height @xmath13 to scale length @xmath14 .",
    "their results indicate that disks at redshift @xmath15 are smaller , in absolute value , than present day disk galaxies , and have a thickness ratio , @xmath16 larger by a factor @xmath17 .",
    "support for such a thickening of disk galaxies at high redshifts also comes from @xcite , who inferred from their study of galaxies in the hubble ultra - deep - field that high redshift disk galaxies are thicker than local spirals by a factor of @xmath18 .",
    "studies such as these are clearly increasing our knowledge of the evolutionary stages of populations of disk galaxies , yet the path taken for galaxies to evolve between these stages remains unclear , and reliant on modeling .",
    "the general scenario of galaxy formation within the cosmological context , as envisioned by @xcite , involves extended dark halos of galaxies forming hierarchically by gravitational clustering of non - dissipative dark matter .",
    "the luminous components form by a combination of the gravitational clustering and dissipative collapse .",
    "a general framework for the formation of disk galaxies was outlined in @xcite . in their model ,",
    "a uniformly rotating , homogeneous protogalactic cloud of gas begins to collapse as it decouples from the hubble flow .",
    "this protogalaxy is endowed with angular momentum from tidal torques driven by surrounding structure ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is assumed that the baryons destined to form the disk receive the same tidal torques as the dark matter before much dissipation occurs .",
    "if the collapse is smooth , then specific angular momentum is conserved and the gas forms a thin , rapidly rotating disk ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "detailed direct modeling has highlighted that the above disk formation scenario is far from simple within a cold dark matter ( cdm ) universe .",
    "complex baryonic processes involving multiple gas phases and energy feedback , for example from quasars , supernovae , and stellar winds , have proven difficult to model , yet these processes appear to be crucial in the formation and evolution of disk galaxies within the context of hierarchical structure assembly .",
    "early simulations employed thermal feedback , following @xcite , augmented somewhat in @xcite , who added a variable fraction of supernova energy as kinetic energy .",
    "this type of feedback has been popular up until recent times ( e.g. @xcite ) , even though it was known to be highly inefficient , with thermal energy radiating away over timescales shorter than the dynamical timescales @xcite .",
    "the effects of this inefficient feedback , in light of the the overcooling problem ( @xcite ) , was the rapid formation of stars in the early collapsing halos .",
    "subsequent mergers of these halos resulted in loss of angular momentum to the dark halo , resulting in disk galaxies being dominated by stellar halo components , and significantly deficient in angular momentum .",
    "@xcite showed that the suppression of early radiative cooling in numerical simulations can result in more realistically sized disks .",
    "the problem was tackled in @xcite by turning off cooling for a fixed time in gas within the sph smoothing kernel of a supernova event . although lacking detailed insights into the multiphase gas processes involved in galaxy formation , these models succeeded in regulating star formation in small halos , and resulted in increased angular momentum in the simulated disk galaxy . in @xcite , we simulated galaxies _ using identical initial conditions _ with these two different feedback methods . the thermal feedback following @xcite resulted in galaxies which are dominated by a high mass , high metallicity spheroidal stellar component , with a low mass disk component .",
    "by regulating star formation in low mass building blocks , the adiabatic feedback model , which follows @xcite , formed galaxies with a dominant disk component , and a low mass , low metallicity stellar halo .",
    "sommer - larsen and collaborators have examined other implementations of feedback , and also shown the importance of regulating cooling at early epochs ( @xcite ) .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite highlights the importance of resolution in simulating disk galaxies .",
    "implementing these findings has allowed models such as @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to make progress in reproducing disk galaxies with properties approaching those of observed disks .",
    "our chemo - dynamical models for simulating disk galaxies ( which we will refer to as sgals , to avoid confusion with real galaxies ) have been successful in forming disk galaxies with a dominant young , metal - rich disk component , with a metal poor , old stellar halo , and an old , intermediate metallicity thick disk component .",
    "the sgals have many features observed in the milky way and local disk galaxies , including metallicities , abundances , ages , and color gradients of the stellar populations of the thin and thick disks , metallicities and abundances of the stellar halo , and the relation between luminosity and metallicity of the stellar halo ( @xcite ; @xcite [ hereafter bkgf ] ; @xcite [ hereafter bgmk ] ; @xcite ) . here",
    "we report on the evolution of the disk component of such sgals , specifically after redshift @xmath2 .",
    "we deliberately follow the evolution of our sgals at times after which they have settled into a disk morphology , and trace their luminosity , scale length , scale height , and central surface brightness .",
    "we hope to provide insight into how the disk component of late - type galaxies evolve in their relatively `` quiescent phase , '' during which mergers are only minor and star formation occurs almost exclusively in the disk regions .    in this paper , we concentrate on the evolution of the size - mass and size - central surface brightness relations and the `` thickness '' of four simulated disk galaxies ( sgals ) , and what these tell us about interpreting observations .",
    "we also examine the evolution of the magnitude and color of our simulated galaxies .",
    "our study will not allow direct comparison with the observational studies which compare distant galaxy populations to `` like '' local galaxy populations ; it is not clear which galaxies are likely progenitors of today s galaxies . yet , by providing evolutionary paths that disk galaxies can be expected to follow , our study will provide insights into the interpretation of such observations , in particular in how to interpolate between the two populations .",
    "the four sgals studied here are the same as were studied in bgmk .",
    "they are formed using our galactic chemo - dynamical evolution code , gcd+ , which self - consistently models the effects of gravity , gas dynamics , radiative cooling , and star formation .",
    "full details of gcd+ can be found in kawata & gibson ( 2003 ) .",
    "all galaxies are formed with the _ adiabatic feedback model _ from @xcite . in this model , gas within the sph smoothing kernel of sne ii explosions is prevented from cooling .",
    "this adiabatic phase is assumed to last for the lifetime of the lowest mass star which ends as a sne ii , i.e. the lifetime of an 8-m star ( 100 myr ) . in the afm",
    ", the energy released by sne ia , which do not trace starburst regions , is fed back as thermal energy .",

    "this simplified model allows us to run a suite of simulations at high resolution , whilst retaining the most important features of full cosmological simulations .",
    "the choice of large values of @xmath31 , and initial conditions in which no major merger occurs in late epochs ( @xmath32 ) , ensures that disk sgals are formed .",

    "this choice was made merely for convenience . as we showed in bgmk ,",
    "the consequences of using this cosmology with the initial conditions of this study , rather than the now standard @xmath38cdm cosmology , are negligible . essentially , prior to the redshift of collapse @xmath39 , a @xmath38cdm universe is almost identical to a einstein - de  sitter universe , while after that redshift , the system is so dense that the background cosmology becomes irrelevant . for a detailed proof ,",
    "we refer the reader to bgmk .",

    "along with these variations in parameters , different random seeds are incorporated in the initial conditions of the sgals , creating evolutionary diversity in our sample .",
    "we employed 38911 dark matter and 38911 gas / star particles for each model .",
    "our model results in the formation of late - type sgals which have a dominant disk component , with a low mass , metal poor halo component ( bkgf ) . figure  [ sgal1 ] shows the rest frame @xmath1-band surface brightness profile of sgal1 , both edge - on ( upper panels ) and face - on ( lower panels ) , at three epochs : @xmath40 ( corresponding to a lookback time of 7.3 gyrs ) @xmath41 ( 5.7 gyrs ) , and @xmath6 .",
    "figures  [ sgal2]-[sgal4 ] show corresponding plots for sgals 2 - 4 , shown at @xmath0 ( corresponding to lookback time of 8.5 gyrs ) @xmath41 ( @xmath42 for sgal2 , lookback time 4.8 gyrs ) , and @xmath6 .",
    "these epochs are chosen to be : ( a ) after the thick disk formation epoch , when the old thin disk has begun to form ; ( b ) at an intermediate time ; and ( c ) the present , respectively . the different time chosen for the early epoch of sgal1 ( @xmath40 )",
    "was taken as that simulated galaxy is undergoing a significant merger at @xmath0 , and we need our sgals to have a settled disk structure for a fair comparison with distant galaxies which have been selected for their disk features .",
    "similarly , a satellite is being accreted to sgal2 at the intermediate epoch , @xmath430.5 , so we chose a later intermediate time , @xmath42 for this sgal .",
    "the surface brightness is calculated by assuming that each star particle is a single stellar population , and using the ssps of @xcite , with a simple salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) parameterized by a power - law slope of 1.35 and lower and upper mass of 0.1 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the photometric properties of sgals discussed here are all intrinsic values , where we avoid discussing the effect of the dust absorption",
    ".    total @xmath1-band magnitudes of the sgals are found by integrating the luminosity densities displayed in these images .",
    "the results are shown in column  3 of table  [ results ] .",
    "we see that the galaxies have an average @xmath45 at the earliest epoch ( which we will refer to as @xmath15 ) , an average of @xmath46 at the intermediate epoch ( @xmath47 ) and @xmath48 at @xmath6 .",
    "the higher luminosity at earlier times is largely due to the enhanced star formation at the epoch during which the thick disk forms ( see bkgf ) , the epoch which precedes the `` early epoch '' ( @xmath12 ) analyzed in this study .",
    "the rate of star formation is lower during the more quiescent later epochs , resulting in evolution toward fainter magnitudes at the present .",
    "we repeat the above process in both the rest frame @xmath7 and @xmath49 bands , and derive @xmath50 and @xmath51 colors .",
    "the @xmath50 and @xmath51 colors are shown in columns  5 and  6 of table  [ results ] , respectively .",
    "the galaxies become redder during the relatively quiescent late epochs studied , from an average @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) of 1.1 ( 0.7 ) at @xmath52@xmath531 , to 1.5 ( 0.9 ) at @xmath47 , and 1.7 ( 1.0 ) at @xmath6 .",
    "these redder colors are due to the effects of a decreasing star formation rate , aging stellar populations , and more metal rich stellar populations being born in the disk region .",
    "the redder colors are not sufficient to overcome the decrease in @xmath1-band luminosity ; the sgals also become fainter in the redder bands .    the @xmath1-band surface brightness profiles for the four sgals are plotted against radius in figure  [ scalelengths ] , at the three epochs shown in figures  [ sgal1]-[sgal4 ] .",
    "we use open stars for the early phase of evolution ( @xmath15 ) , open squares for the intermediate phase ( @xmath47 ) , and solid triangles for @xmath6 in this and all ensuing plots in order to allow evolution of the properties of the disk sgals to be easily followed . outside the central bulge regions ,",
    "the disk components can be approximated reasonably by exponential fits .",
    "this allows us to derive disk scale lengths for each sgal at each epoch .",
    "this is done in two stages .",
    "an approximate scale length @xmath54 is derived by fitting between 4 and 20 kpc .",
    "this allows us to then make fits between @xmath55 ( to exclude the bulge ) and @xmath56 .",
    "numerous tests verified that this technique gave robust results , which are shown column  9 in table  [ results ] .",
    "scale lengths increase from an average of 2.9 at @xmath12 to an average of 3.5 at @xmath47 , and to 4.1 by @xmath6 .",
    "the implication is that the galaxies grow from the `` inside - out . ''",
    "we plot the surface brightness profiles of the four sgals perpendicular to the disk in figure  [ scaleheights ] .",
    "we exclude the bulge region when calculating how the surface brightness varies with distance from the disk plane .",
    "again , the profiles are well fitted with exponentials , and we fit between 0 and 2.5 scale heights ( essentially out to 1.5 kpc in figure  [ scaleheights ] ) using similar techniques as employed to derive scale lengths .",
    "the derived scale heights are shown in column  8 of table  [ results ] .",
    "scale heights remain close to constant , with an average of @xmath57 at @xmath15 to an average of @xmath58 at @xmath59 , and an average of @xmath60 at @xmath6 .",
    "we derive the thickness of the disks , defined as the ratio of scale height to scale length , @xmath61 , and show the results column  10 in table  [ results ] . on average , the galaxies are `` thicker '' at the earlier epochs , by a factor of @xmath62 at @xmath15 .",
    "this is due to the no evolution of the scale hight and the increasing scale length with decreasing redshift .",
    "our simulation does show little evolution of the scale height , because the thick disk forms first , followed by the thin disk formation , as discussed in bkgf .",
    "if the thick disk comes from heating of the thin disk , we should expect an increasing scale height with decreasing redshift , and a slower evolution of the disk thickness .",
    "further observations of the thickness evolution will help constrain thick disk formation scenarios .",
    "the evolution of the thickness in our sgals ( in the sense that the galaxies become thinner ) is driven by the inside - out thin disk formation . at the intermediate epoch ,",
    "the sgals show a marginal increase in thickness , by a factor of @xmath63 at @xmath59 ; galaxies settle rapidly to disk morphologies after their last `` significant '' merger ( i.e. a merger likely to alter the morphology of the galaxy ) .",
    "numerical heating is an issue when considering vertical structure in numerical simulations , but we have reason to believe that our results are not affected significantly .",
    "previous studies at similar resolution to ours have shown numerical vertical heating to be relatively low ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure 2 of bgmk shows the vertical velocity dispersion versus age for four sgals in this study , which demonstrates relatively little vertical heating during the disks quiescent period ; in the order of 20% over the last @xmath64 gyrs . even if this were totally attributed to numerical heating ( unlikely as processes such as spiral structure and substructure heating will contribute )",
    ", our results will not be greatly affected , because the vertical scale height is proportional to the square root of the velocity dispersion , i.e @xmath65 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our measured scale height at @xmath6 will be , in the worst case , overestimated by @xmath5310% .",
    "as far as relevance to our study , the important point that we note is that any artificial heating will not affect our results _",
    "qualitatively_. in the absence of such effects , our conclusions that our simulated disk galaxies become _ flatter _ ( @xmath61 decreases ) will hold .",
    "our _ quantitative _ estimates would then be underestimating this effect .",
    "having said this , higher resolution studies will increase the reliability of the _ quantitative _ estimates    the way that the structural parameters , scale length and scale height , evolve relative to one another can be ascertained from figure  [ hzhl ] .",
    "also plotted as crosses are observations of local disk galaxies from schwarzkopf & dettmar ( 2000 ) .",
    "plotted as open circles are observations of 34 edge - on disk galaxies at @xmath52@xmath531 , taken from rdc .",
    "the @xmath12 disk galaxies of rdc are found to be smaller and thicker than local galaxies , as determined by previous studies , such as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our sgals evolve in this plot primarily by increasing in scale length , with less evolution in scale height , resulting in galaxies evolving across this diagram , from left to right .",
    "central surface brightness , again in the rest frame in the @xmath1-band , is derived by extrapolating the exponential fits from figure  [ scalelengths ] to @xmath66 .",
    "results are shown in column  7 of table  [ results ] .",
    "we find that our sgals are brighter at earlier epochs , with an average @xmath67 at @xmath15 , compared with @xmath68 at @xmath59 , and @xmath69 at @xmath6 .",
    "this is related to the higher star formation rates at the earlier epochs in our sgals , as shown in figure  5 of bgmk .",
    "this is consistent with observations , which point to star formation rates being higher at earlier epochs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we plot the @xmath1-band central surface brightness against the flatness parameter , @xmath70 ( the inverse of the thickness parameter ) , in figure  [ mubhlhz ] .",
    "the sgals have higher surface brightness and are thicker at earlier times , closer to the merging epochs when the thick disks formed .",
    "as the thin disk grows larger in the more quiescent later stages of their evolution , the sgals become less bright , and also thinner . at each epoch , it is also apparent that brighter sgals are thicker , although this trend is not as strong as the trend with time , because the sgals we have studied are all relatively quiescent throughout the epoch during which evolution is followed in this study .",
    "this supports the conclusions of rdc , who plotted the relation between @xmath70 and central surface brightness of @xmath15 galaxies ( their fig  .7 ) , and found that the brightest objects have the thickest disk .",
    "they speculated that enhanced star formation and enhanced thickness are the results of ongoing interactions and mergings .",
    "we derive the stellar mass @xmath71 of each sgal at each epoch using the friends - of - friends algorithm , and confirm that sensitivity to our choice of linking length is insignificant .",
    "results are displayed in column  4 of table  [ results ] .",
    "the inside - out nature of the growth of the thin disk in our sgals is apparent in the relationship between the stellar mass and scale length , shown in figure  [ masshl ] .",
    "the mass and size of the sgals grow together .",
    "although we do not want to overemphasize the quantitative nature of our results , using just four relatively homogeneous l@xmath72 sgals , we note that the ratio @xmath73 does not evolve , with the average at each epoch staying remarkably close to @xmath74 .",
    "qualitatively , it is clear that the thin disks of our sgals increase in size as they grow in mass , and the disk evolves along the mass scale length relation .",

    "<S> increasingly large populations of disk galaxies are now being observed at increasingly high redshifts , providing new constraints on our knowledge of how such galaxies evolve . are these observations consistent with a cosmology in which structures form hierarchically ? </S>",
    "<S> to probe this question , we employ sph / n - body galaxy scale simulations of late - type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the evolution of these simulated disk galaxies from redshift 1 to 0 , looking at the mass - size and luminosity - size relations , and the thickness parameter , defined as the ratio of scale height to scale length . </S>",
    "<S> the structural parameters of our simulated disks settle down quickly , and after redshift @xmath0 the galaxies evolve to become only slightly flatter . </S>",
    "<S> our present day simulated galaxies are larger , more massive , less bright , and redder than at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the inside - out nature of the growth of our simulated galaxies reduces , and perhaps eliminates , expectations of evolution in the size - mass relation . </S>"
