    "self - assembly of molecules on surfaces has become a topic of intensive research , both from a fundamental point of view and for developing electronics based on molecular units.@xcite for controlling the kinetic growth , the diffusion coefficient is an important parameter .",

    "recently , this method has been extended to molecules with sizes larger than the step length of translational moves.@xcite this way absolute values of @xmath0 become accessible .",
    "furthermore , the residence time - distribution@xcite ( rtd ) has been discussed and another new method , the interpeak - time distribution ( it d ) , has been introduced .",
    "the rtd is the distribution of peak widths and the it d is the distribution of time intervals between successive peaks .",
    "both of them are suitable to determine absolute values of @xmath0 .",
    "various merits and limits have been discussed for the three variants based on the acf , rtd , and itd.@xcite from a general point of view , inter - molecular and molecule - tip interactions can affect the results .",
    "the acf is influenced by both of these interactions , while the it d is influenced only by inter - molecular interactions .",
    "accordingly , the rtd method can be viewed as the most powerful one , because it is only influenced by the molecule - tip interaction , which can be reduced systematically by adjusting the molecule - probe distance.@xcite        so far , the focus lay on molecules , whose shape can be effectively described by a circle .",

    "combining the corresponding solution with the approximate solution for pure translation ( see discussion above ) , an effective radius now appears that varies between @xmath147 ( for @xmath148 ) and @xmath149^{1/2}$ ] ( for @xmath150 ) . using the kmc simulations we again checked that this procedure gives good estimates for both diffusion coefficients @xmath60 and @xmath0 .",
    "the model of uncoupled rotation and translation with a fixed jump angle @xmath86 is certainly a strong simplification and further work is necessary to account for non - uniform jump angles , rotation centers displaced from the molecule center , rotation - translation couplings , etc .",
    "irrespective of these complications , the possibility to simultaneously determine rotational and translational diffusion coefficients is a promising perspective that calls for an experimental verification .",
