    "the schwarzschild solution has proved to play a fundamental importance in conceptual discussions of general relativity , and beyond , for instance , regarding event horizons , spacetime singularities and aspects of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes .",
    "it has also been important providing the first insights regarding the phenomenon of gravitational collapse @xcite and inspired the construction of theoretical models of relativistic stars @xcite . before the mid-1960s , the object now known as a black hole , was referred to as a collapsed star @xcite or as a frozen star @xcite , and it was only in 1965 that marked an era of intensive research into black hole physics .",
    "relatively to the issue of experimental tests of the schwarzschild solution , the exterior geometry has been extremely successful in explaining , for instance , the precession of mercury s perihelion , and the phenomenon of the bending of light , where the exterior schwarzschild gravitational field acts as a gravitational lens .    despite of its important role ,",
    "one still encounters , in the literature , the existence of misconceptions and a certain ambiguity inherent in the schwarzschild solution .",
    "for instance , a problematic aspect is the presence of an event horizon , which in the schwarzschild black hole solution acts as a one - way membrane , permitting future - directed null or timelike curves to cross only from the exterior to the interior region .",
    "it acts as a boundary of all events which , in principle , may be observed by an exterior observer .",
    "it is believed that the gravitational collapse of a compact body results in a singularity hidden beyond an event horizon . if the singularity were visible to the exterior region , one would have a _ naked singularity _ , which would open the realm for wild speculation .",
    "this led to penrose s _ cosmic censorship conjecture _ @xcite , which stipulates that all physically reasonable spacetimes are globally hyperbolic , forbidding the existence of naked singularities , and only allowing singularities to be hidden behind event horizons .",
    "the cosmic censorship conjecture has been an active area of research and the source of considerable controversy . for the interior black hole solution ,",
    "a remarkable change occurs in the nature of spacetime , namely , the external spatial radial and temporal coordinates exchange their character to temporal and spatial coordinates , respectively . thus , the interior solution represents a non - static spacetime , as the metric coefficients are now time - dependent .",
    "this also implies that a singularity occurs at a spacelike hypersurface , @xmath0 .",
    "thus , no observer , interior or exterior to the schwarzschild radius , will be able to observe the formation , or for that matter , the physical effects of the singularity @xcite .",
    "these aspects show the existence of inconsistencies and a certain ambiguity inherent in the schwarzschild solution .    still relatively to the issue of the black hole event horizon",
    ", a widespread misconception in the literature is that a test particle approaches the schwarzschild radius at the speed of light for all observers , and not as a limiting process for a static observer located at the event horizon given by the null hypersurface @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the black hole mass .",
    "we shall use geometrized units , i.e. , @xmath3 , for notational convenience , throughout this paper .",
    "if one accepts that a particle has the speed of light with respect to a static observer , at @xmath4 , then using the local special relativity velocity composition law , the observer concludes that the particle has the speed of light with respect to all observers , which is another way of saying that in the frame of a photon all particles have speed @xmath5 .",
    "of course , the frame of the photon is not a physical frame .",
    "indeed , it should be emphasized that an observer can not remain at rest at @xmath4 , as it implies an infinite acceleration to do so .",
    "another erroneous extrapolation of @xmath6 at @xmath4 , is that timelike particles attain velocities superior to the speed of light in the black hole region @xmath7 , and thus justifying the existence of tachyons , or for that matter of particles with velocities superior to the speed of light in the framework of general relativity @xcite .",
    "all things considered , it should be stressed once again that one can only use static observers in the spacetime region characterized by @xmath8 . and",
    "it was shown that the test particle does indeed cross the event horizon with a velocity less than the speed of light @xcite with respect to an appropriate physical observer .",
    "an exact general expression was further deduced , in terms of the constants of motion of both a test particle and an observer moving along radially infalling geodesics @xcite , given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the constants of motion for the test particle and the observer , respectively .",
    "this expression shows that the value of the velocity at @xmath4 is indeed less than @xmath12 , unless @xmath10 or @xmath11 are zero or infinite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details , and ref .",
    "@xcite for further discussions ) .",
    "relatively to spacetime singularities , a key aspect is whether they are a disaster for the theory , as they imply the breakdown of predictability .",
    "various definitions of singularities can be encountered in the literature , ranging from specific invariants , constructed from the curvature tensor and its covariant derivatives , becoming infinite , to the notion of geodesic incompleteness .",
    "accordingly , one encounters several attitudes to spacetime singularities @xcite : firstly , singularities are mere artifacts of unrealistic and idealized models where infinities occur .",
    "secondly , general relativity entails singularities , according to the penrose - hawking theorems in the context of geodesic incompleteness , and fails to accurately describe nature .",
    "thirdly , one may have a more optimistic viewpoint , as expressed by misner , who views the existence of singularities ,  not as proof of our ignorance , but as a source from which we can derive much valuable understanding of cosmology\"@xcite .",
    "much of the scepticism related to the concepts of event horizons and spacetime singularities , outlined above , and others such as the information paradox , has inspired new and fascinating ideas @xcite , namely by replacing the interior solution , and thus , doing away with the problems related to these issues . in this context , it is interesting to note the emergence of a new picture for an alternative final state of gravitational collapse , where an interior compact object is matched to an exterior schwarzschild vacuum spacetime , at or near where the event horizon is expected to form .",
    "these alternative models do not possess a singularity at the origin and have no event horizon , as its rigid surface is located at a radius slightly greater than the schwarzschild radius . in particular , the gravastar ( _ grav_itational _ va_cuum _ star _ ) picture , proposed by mazur and mottola @xcite , has an effective phase transition at / near where the event horizon is expected to form , and the interior is replaced by a de sitter condensate .",
    "it has also been argued that there is no way of distinguishing a schwarzschild black hole from a gravastar from observational data @xcite . however , a realistic model for the gravitational collapse leading to compact interior objects is still lacking .",
    "we also emphasize that , although interesting in themselves , the solutions that do away with the interior singularity and the event horizon @xcite sweep the inherent conceptual difficulties of black holes under the rug , and that the interior structure of realistic black holes has not been satisfactorily determined , being still open to considerable debate .    in this work , we shall review and analyze the interior schwarzschild solution in some detail . in the literature ,",
    "the interior geometry is considered as a continuity of the exterior geometry .",
    "therefore , for instance , infalling test particles are considered ending up at a central singularity located at @xmath13 . however , the latter singularity is a spacelike hypersurface , and the test particles are not directed towards a privileged point , but directed along a temporal direction , in order to not violate causality .",
    "thus , if one looks at the interior geometry as a continuation of the exterior static solution , one comes across some extremely interesting conceptual difficulties , that question the very concept of a black hole . in this work",
    "we shall address some of these difficulties .",
    "we shall start by obtaining the metric for the interior region without inferring directly to the traditional schwarzschild solution . with this geometry at hand",
    ", one may analyze this interior region , without the prejudices inherited from the exterior region . however , we emphasize that we shall compare both regions where it is convenient to do so .",
    "we find new interesting features and peculiarities not encountered in the literature , and show that this scenario can be interpreted as a cosmological solution .",
    "this paper is outlined in the following manner : firstly , in section [ sec : interior ] , we deduce the interior metric by considering time - dependent metric fields , paying close attention to several cosmological interpretations of this solution .",
    "we also address some of the difficulties associated to spacetimes singularities , and argue that it is perhaps possible for an observer to know if he is inside or outside the schwarzschild radius , by examining an invariant of a covariant derivative of the curvature tensor .",
    "secondly , in sections [ sec : conserved ] and [ sec : geodesics ] , we deduce the conserved quantities of null and timelike geodesics in some detail , discussing several particular cases .",
    "thirdly , in sections [ sec : ek - coordinates ] and [ sec : kruskal - coordinates ] , we analyze the eddington - finkelstein and kruskal coordinates directly from the interior solution .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we shall be interested in the spacetime metric given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the spacetime coordinates .",
    "assume that @xmath17 , so that the line element with @xmath18 and @xmath19 describes a @xmath20sphere with an area given by @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , we shall consider the specific case of @xmath22 .    to set the nomenclature , note that the mathematical analysis and the physical interpretation will be simplified using a set of orthonormal basis vectors .",
    "these may be interpreted as the proper reference frame of a set of observers who remain at rest in the coordinate system @xmath16 , with @xmath23 fixed .",
    "denote the basis vectors in the coordinate system as @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",

    "despite the fact that one may not talk about an asymptotic limit , for the interior solution , it is interesting to note that the spacetime assumes an instantaneous minkowski form , for @xmath92 , although the curvature does not become zero .",

    "while for the exterior observer , infalling particles tend to a central singularity , from the interior point of view , the proper distance along the @xmath75direction increases , showing the existence of a cigar - like singularity .",
    "we emphasize that the latter occurs along a spacelike hypersurface .",
    "another difference worth mentioning is that the exterior observer considers a spherically symmetric geometry , while the interior observer may consider the geometry plane , as points for different @xmath95 are parallel to one another ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details regarding this issue ) .",
    "the schwarzschild solution has played a fundamental role in conceptual discussions of general relativity , in particular , regarding spacetime singularities , as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "a key aspect of singularities in general relativity is whether they are a disaster for the theory , as it implies the breakdown of predictability .",
    "attitudes in the literature range from @xcite : singularities are mere artifacts of unrealistic and idealized models ; general relativity entails singularities , but fails to accurately describe nature ; and one may view the existence of singularities `` not as proof of our ignorance , but as a source from which we can derive much valuable understanding of cosmology '' , quoting misner in the latter attitude @xcite .    a way of detecting singularities is to find where the energy density or the spacetime curvature become infinite and the usual description of the spacetime breaks down .",
    "however , to be sure that there is an essential singularity which can not be transformed away by a coordinate transformation , invariants are constructed from the curvature tensor , such as @xmath38 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and from certain covariant derivatives of the curvature tensor .",
    "for instance , in the schwarzschild spacetime there is an essential curvature singularity at @xmath13 in the sense that along any non - spacelike trajectory falling into the singularity , as @xmath99 , the so - called kretschman scalar tends to infinity , i.e. , @xmath100 , as shall be shown below . in this case , however , all future directed non - spacelike geodesics which enter the event horizon at @xmath4 must fall into this curvature singularity within a finite value of the affine parameter .",
    "so , all such curves are future geodesically incomplete . for the black hole region , given by the metric ( [ intmetric ] )",
    ", the scalar kretschmann polynomial , @xmath101 , is given by @xmath102 showing that a curvature singularity occurs at @xmath0 .",
    "it is remarkable that a change of sign occurs in the following scalar @xcite , as an observer traverses the event horizon @xmath103 note that the invariant is zero on the horizon @xmath80 .",
    "it is perhaps possible that this invariant is devoid of a fundamental significance .",
    "however , it is generally known that using the curvature tensor and some of its covariant derivatives , the analysis gives a complete description of the geometry , and are directly measurable .",
    "since these quantities are coordinate invariant , the problems associated with a specific choice of the coordinate system vanish .",
    "this argument may be used in favor of separating the interior from the exterior region .",
    "the tidal acceleration felt by an observer at rest is given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the observer s four velocity and @xmath106 is the separation between two arbitrary parts of his body .",

    "these stretchings and contractions are now time - dependent , contrary to their counterparts in the exterior region , and as @xmath114 , the tidal forces diverge .",

    "we have provided a brief pedagogical review and further analyzed the interior schwarzschild solution .",
    "firstly , by deducing the interior metric by considering time - dependent metric fields , we have analyze the interior region , without the prejudices inherited from the exterior region . with this geometry at hand ,",
    "we have payed close attention to several respective cosmological interpretations , and addressed some of the difficulties associated to spacetimes singularities .",
    "secondly , we have deduced the conserved quantities of null and timelike geodesics , and discussed several particular cases in some detail .",
    "finally , we examined the eddington - finkelstein and kruskal coordinates directly from the interior solution .",
    "a black hole is believed to have formed from the gravitational collapse of a massive body .",
    "however , events occurring in the interior of the event horizon are not observable for an exterior observer , and one may argue that relatively to the latter , black holes are not relevant physical objects @xcite .",
    "although the event horizon exists for exterior observers , all events in the range @xmath8 are accessible to the interior observers .",
    "if one looks at the interior geometry as a continuation of the exterior static solution , one comes across some extremely interesting conceptual difficulties , that question the very concept of a black hole .",
    "for instance , while for the exterior observer , infalling particles end up at a central singularity at @xmath13 , from the interior point of view , the proper distance along the @xmath75direction increases , showing the existence of a cigar - like singularity .",
    "the latter singularity is a spacelike hypersurface , and the test particles are not directed towards a privileged point , however , in order to not violate causality they are directed along a temporal direction from @xmath80 to @xmath0 .",
    "a curious behavior relatively to an interior observer is also verified , as all infalling particles crossing the event horizon , occur simultaneously at @xmath80 . in this context , the eddington - finkelstein and kruskal transformations do indeed solve the coordinate singularity at @xmath4 , but do not solve the problems associated with the inversion of the @xmath175 and @xmath42 coordinates .",
    "assuming that @xmath175 is a temporal coordinate for @xmath213 , also signifies giving it a determined direction and duration , i.e. , the black hole , or for that matter a white hole , possesses a finite coordinate temporal duration .",
    "however , the exterior geometry is static , and once created does not disappear .",
    "an interesting feature relatively to the interior geometry is the issue of proper distances .",
    "the proper distance between two particles at rest separated by a constant @xmath91 , decreases along the @xmath75direction as coordinate time flows from @xmath0 to @xmath80 , and increases as coordinate time flows backwards from @xmath80 to @xmath0 . in counterpart ,",
    "the proper distance between two simultaneous events along a spatial trajectory with @xmath93 and @xmath89 , increases as @xmath42 varies from @xmath0 to @xmath80 , and decreases when the temporal coordinate runs backwards from @xmath80 to @xmath0 .",
    "another surprising result , considering the interior point of view , is that the trajectories of particles at rest are geodesics , contrary to the exterior where particles at rest are necessarily accelerated .",
    "this fact is due to the non - static character of the interior geometry .    in this work ,",
    "we have addressed some conceptual difficulties related to the notion of black holes .",
    "the solutions that do away with the interior singularity and the event horizon @xcite , although interesting in themselves , sweep the inherent conceptual difficulties of black holes under the rug . in concluding , we note that the interior structure of realistic black holes have not been satisfactorily determined , and are still open to considerable debate .",
