    "a competing mechanism , in which star formation is predominantly driven by in - falling gas - rich material has also been proposed ( e.g. @xcite ) .    by using high angular - resolution observations of the molecular gas component of these galaxies , it is possible to constrain their kinematic and morphological properties , and establish the origin of their intense star - formation in a way that is neither affected by dust extinction nor biased by outflows @xcite . while most of these studies have so far been hampered by the limited spatial resolution of the observations ,",
    "the advent of the atacama large millimetre / submillimetre array ( alma ) has made it possible to make sensitive studies of sub - mm galaxies on arcsec - scales @xcite .",
    "the recent addition of the long baseline capacity of alma has further improved the imaging quality ( 30 to 300 mas resolution ; e.g. @xcite ) . at the same time , strong gravitational lensing has allowed the study of high - redshift sub - mm galaxies on 50 - 100  pc - scales , which is comparable to what is achieved at lower redshift @xcite .    in this letter , we take advantage of the enhanced spatial resolution provided by the long baseline capability of alma , in combination with the magnifying power of strong gravitational lensing to study the molecular gas distribution and kinematics of the starburst galaxy sdp.81 ( h - atlas j090311.6 + 003906 ; @xmath9 3.042@xmath10.001 ; @xcite ) . in a previous paper ( @xcite ;",
    "referred to as paper i ) , we presented an analysis of the gravitational lens mass model and a study of the reconstructed heated dust continuum emission at a resolution better than 50  pc . here , we focus on a detailed analysis of the co emission line data that were also taken during the science verification of the alma long baseline array . these data are coupled with high angular resolution imaging from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) and karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) to investigate the conditions that produced the intense burst of star - formation within sdp.81 .",
    "the alma spectral line observations of sdp.81 and the image processing are discussed in detail by the @xcite . to summarize ,",
    "the co ( 5 - 4 ) , co ( 8 - 7 ) , co ( 10 - 9 ) and h@xmath10o ( 2@xmath11 - 1@xmath12 ) transitions were observed for between 4.4 and 5.9  h in bands 4 , 6 and 7 . the array consisted of between 22 and 36 antennas with baselines ranging from 15 m to 15 km . during our analysis , we found that the co ( 10 - 9 ) and h@xmath10o emission was too weak to provide reliable velocity and velocity dispersion maps , so we do not consider them further here , and instead we focus on the co ( 5 - 4 ) and co ( 8 - 7 ) transitions .    the gravitational lens mass model for sdp.81",
    "was derived in paper  i by applying a bayesian pixelated modelling technique ( rybak et al .",

    "to the visibility data of the band 6 and 7 continuum emission .",
    "this lens model is used for the analysis of the co emission line data here , that is , the lens parameters are kept fixed at the most probable values derived in paper  i , while the emission line structure and its regularization level are left as free parameters . in order to model the two - dimensional spectral maps of the co lines we first subtracted the continuum emission from the _ uv_-dataset using the line - free channels . as the emission lines are quite broad , we averaged the data by 2 channels resulting in a velocity resolution lines of 41  kms@xmath13 for both lines .",
    "this was found to be a reasonable compromise between velocity space sampling ( to study the structure of the lines ) and signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) for a robust source reconstruction . also , to limit the number of visibilities used in our analysis and to ensure that we compare the various transitions on the same angular - scale , a 1  m@xmath14 cut in the _",

    "the data were taken through the f110w and f160w filters , with exposure times of 712 and 4418  s , respectively ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "the _ hst _ imaging detected a single dominant lensing galaxy , two gravitational arcs from the background source and extended low - surface brightness structures around the system .",

    "although the arcs are offset , due to their different positions in the source - plane ( see below ) , the separation between the main and counter - arc is the same in both the infrared and mm components , which demonstrates that they are at the same redshift .",
    "we model the infrared emission using the pixelated gravitational lensing code of @xcite .",

    "these maps show clear excitation dependent structure in the molecular gas distribution of sdp.81 . the co ( 5 - 4 ) emission has both diffuse and multiple compact structures that extend over @xmath83  kpc in the north - south direction , with an additional low surface brightness component that is @xmath812  kpc in size towards the north - east of the source .",
    "the emission from the co ( 8 - 7 ) transition is much more compact , with an extent of about @xmath81.5  kpc , and there is only a single brightness clump .",

    "we find that our source - plane reconstructions are in good agreement with the observed image - plane structure of the counter - arc .",
    "the total magnification of the co ( 5 - 4 ) and co ( 8 - 7 ) gas components are 17.0@xmath10.4 and 16.9@xmath11.1 , respectively .    the total velocity integrated emission from the co ( 5 - 4 ) and co",

    "[ fig : image ] ) . also , the co ( 1 - 0 ) emission from starburst galaxies has been found to be extended by up to @xmath816  kpc ( fwhm ; @xcite ) , and so the magnification of this gas component is likely much smaller than for the co ( 5 - 4 ) or co ( 8 - 7 ) emission .",

    "[ fig : profiles ] , we present the intrinsic line profiles of both the co ( 5 - 4 ) and co ( 8 - 7 ) transitions that are corrected for the differential magnification .",
    "we find that both transitions actually have more symmetric profiles , consisting of a double - horn profile , typical of rotating disks , with velocity peaks that are separated by @xmath8290  kms@xmath13 .",
    "again , this result is consistent with the image - plane line profiles of the counter arc .",
    "the co ( 5 - 4 ) and co ( 8 - 7 ) emission lines are also offset by about @xmath1680  kms@xmath13 from the systemic velocity , as defined by the co ( 1 - 0 ) measurement @xcite .",
    "this could be due to there being turbulent in / out flowing higher excitation gas , or that the co ( 1 - 0 ) line also undergoes differential magnification .",
    "the first- and second - moment maps ( velocity and velocity dispersion ) of the co ( 5 - 4 ) and co ( 8 - 7 ) transitions are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : co5 - 4 ] and [ fig : co8 - 7 ] , respectively . the velocity maps for both emission lines show a common central solid - body - like component in the north - south axis . however , the diffuse and extended component of the co ( 5 - 4 ) and the extended tail of the co ( 8 - 7 ) show a different velocity than expected for solid body rotation .",
    "although the co ( 5 - 4 ) extended feature has a slightly higher velocity dispersion than the rest of the emission , the velocity dispersion of the co ( 8 - 7 ) tail feature is significantly different ; the large @xmath8200  kms@xmath13 velocity dispersion is not due to a single broad velocity component , but is due to two velocity components along the same line - of - sight .",

    "this is based on the idea that higher - order moments can be described by a series of concentric ellipses of increasing major - axis length ; the moment profile along each ellipse is then decomposed into a fourier series with a finite number of harmonic terms . from this analysis",
    "we find that both transitions are characterized by a significant level of rotation as well as a significant level of asymmetry at large radii . in the central regions of both transitions , the first harmonic term , @xmath21 , which describes the rotational motion ,",
    "is found to be substantial and the ratio @xmath22 , which represents higher - order deviations from simple rotation , is consistent with zero , as expected for a disk - like rotation .",
    "however , in the outer regions , the @xmath23 term abruptly drops and at the same time the @xmath22 term significantly increases , as expected for multiple kinematical components or for post - coalescence perturbed disks ( * ? ? ?",

    "* b12 ) .    using kinemetry , ( * ? ? ? * s08 ) have devised a criterion to assess whether a galaxy is disk or merger dominated , based on the total kinematic asymmetry ( @xmath24 ) in the dynamical state of the molecular gas .",
    "this criterion has been subsequently revised by b12 , in order to better distinguish between isolated disks and post - coalescence mergers on the basis of large asymmetries at large radii .",
    "we quantify the total kinematic asymmetry to be @xmath25  0.65@xmath10.10 and @xmath26  0.63@xmath10.14 for the co ( 5 - 4 ) transition and @xmath25  0.65@xmath10.14 and @xmath26  0.72@xmath10.20 for the co ( 8 - 7 ) transition ( the uncertainties are a combination of the errors on the fourier coefficients and the uncertainty due to the choice of centre )",
    ". these values are consistent with a merger / post - coalescence merger interpretation according to both criteria ( @xmath27  0.50 and @xmath28  0.15 ) .",
    "note that although the classification criteria have been derived for data with angular resolutions that are much lower than the data presented here , we find that downgrading our resolution does not affect the derived @xmath24 values . finally , the visual criteria by @xcite would classify sdp.81 as a perturbed disk ; while the velocity maps show a clear disk - like velocity gradient , the velocity dispersion map is relatively smooth without an obvious central peak , indicating that the disk is offset from the actual centre of mass .",
    "we estimate the dynamical mass of the disk structure by considering the maximum radius ( 1.56@xmath10.07  kpc ) , maximum velocity ( 150@xmath120  kms@xmath13 ) and the inclination angle ( 45@xmath18  deg ) of the outermost kinemetry ellipse that is consistent with an ordered rotation .",
    "we find an enclosed dynamical mass of @xmath3(@xmath41.56  kpc ) = 1.6@xmath10.6@xmath510@xmath6  m@xmath7 , which although a factor @xmath82 smaller than that determined by @xcite , is consistent at the 2@xmath29-level .",
    "however , as the system is far from being in equilibrium , such dynamical mass estimates should be interpreted with care .",
    "we find significant differences in our visibility - plane reconstructions ( this letter ; @xcite ) and the image - plane reconstructions of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "our reconstructions detect more extended structure within the molecular gas distribution that are not seen in the image - plane analysis .",
    "also , the position and intensity of the compact components are seen to vary between the two methods ( note the compact structure varies significantly even within the individual image - plane analyses of the 1 , 1.3 and 2  mm continuum data ) .",
    "these differences between the visibility- and image - plane results are likely due to the choice of weighting and deconvolution errors in the low snr images of the image - plane channel data ; the _ uv_-taper and weighting that were applied to the image - plane data produces a point spread function with significant side - lobe structure that can introduce spurious artefacts in the channel images . for these reasons",
    "we believe that visibility - plane reconstructions are more robust and less biased , and the interpretation of intensity and velocity maps from image - plane reconstructions requires caution .",
    "the morphological state of sdp.81 is shown in fig .  [ fig : composite ] , where it is apparent that the reconstructed rest - frame uv / optical stellar component ( _ hst _",
    "f160w ) and the combined co ( 5 - 4 ) and co ( 8 - 7 ) molecular gas component ( both from this paper ) , and the heated dust from the rest - frame fir continuum emission presented in paper i form a complex structure . taking the uv / optical stellar emission first , we see that this component is dominated by an elongated @xmath84  kpc structure that is oriented by 45 degrees with respect to the north - south axis .",
    "there is another brightness peak about 4 kpc south of the main uv / optical peak , and they are connected by a low - surface brightness bridge .",
    "note that the diffuse uv / optical structure that is also coincident with the co ( 1 - 0 ) emission extends about @xmath810  kpc south , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : composite ] .",
    "the co ( 5 - 4 ) and ( 8 - 7 ) molecular gas distribution also looks disturbed , with the region to the east being much more diffuse , whereas there is a sharp cut - off ( shown by the small distance between the intensity contours ) in the gas towards the west , which forms a ridge at the contact point with the stellar component .",
    "interestingly , the extended tail that is seen in the co ( 8 - 7 ) molecular gas distribution neatly fits into the area between the main uv / optical component and the bridge feature .",
    "the ongoing star - formation , as traced by the heated dust emission , is concentrated to a region of about 2  kpc in size , and is coincident with the disk - like rotating structure within the inner part of the molecular gas distribution .",
    "this component also shows extension to the east and a sharp cut - off to the western edge .",
    "we note the detection of a compact molecular gas and star - formation component ( 2060  m@xmath7  yr@xmath13  kpc@xmath17 ) near the brightness peak of the uv / optical component , suggesting that star - formation is occurring in both structures .",
    "however , we find no further evidence of either heated dust or excited molecular gas emission across the full 15 kpc of the optical component , even though there is an established stellar population and a large reservoir of co ( 1 - 0 ) available for star - formation .",
    "this suggests that the current burst of star - formation is localised to the northern part of the structure .",
    "the central structure of sdp.81 is somewhat similar to gn20 ( z = 4.05 ; @xcite ) , where the uv / optical emission is offset from the molecular gas component , as traced by lower excitation co ( 2 - 1 ) and the heated dust emission ; these offsets are not uncommon in high - redshift galaxies and may be attributed to dust extinction of the uv / optical stellar emission or to strong negative stellar feedback together with gas accretion from gas clumps or satellites @xcite . like gn20 , there is also evidence for a central star - forming disk at the centre of sdp.81 .",
    "however , there are also marked differences , which suggest that the starburst in sdp.81 may be within an interacting / merging system .",
    "first , our kinemetry analysis of the extended molecular gas distribution suggests a post - coalescence perturbed disk . also , the uv / optical emission shows multiple compact and diffuse components over an elongated @xmath815  kpc region . the co ( 1 - 0 ) data in hand",
    "are not sensitive enough or have high enough angular resolution to determine the relative velocities of these individual components , but it is clear from the overall co ( 1 - 0 ) emission that they form part of the same extended structure .",
    "the merger scenario has been put forward for the triggering mechanism behind the strong star - formation observed within sub - mm galaxies .",
    "this is based on the observed multiple - component morphology and disturbed kinematics of unlensed starbursts and from simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , this conclusion was also recently drawn by @xcite who studied the source plane properties of h - altas  j1429@xmath160028 .",
    "for sdp.81 , the situation is still not clear , but further observations of the co ( 1 - 0 ) emission with the vla at higher angular resolution could measure the relative dynamics of the various uv / optical components .",
    "this would confirm that they form a merging system , with large velocity offsets , or if they are part of a clumpy structure with a more chaotic velocity distribution .",
