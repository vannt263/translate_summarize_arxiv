    "classically if a particle is located in one of the wells of a dswp and does not have sufficient energy to surmount the barrier in the potential , it will be forever confined to that well .",
    "quantum mechanics shows that due to the wave - like nature of the particle , after a certain length of time , there is a non - zero probability that it will be located in the other well .",
    "it is therefore quantum mechanically possible for a particle to pass through a barrier that it can not classically overcome .",
    "this phenomenon is known as quantum tunneling effect .",
    "the quantum tunneling results in the splitting of the low - lying energy levels which occur in pairs with slightly different energy values .",
    "the transition frequency between the energy levels of each pair is associated with the emission or absorption of electromagnetic radiation . particularly in the ammonia molecule",
    "this transition frequency for the ground - state has been measured at about @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon , namely the inversion spectrum of the ammonia molecule , has been observed through infrared spectroscopy and plays a fundamental role in the principle of operation of the ammonia maser@xcite .",
    "although inversion effect occurs in other molecules as well ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) @xcite , @xmath0 provides a tractable vibrational system for experimental observation and exploitation , since inversion frequency falls in the microwave region .    until recently ,",
    "oscillation of probability density in position space @xmath5 between the wells has been the usual way to approach the quantum tunneling phenomenon and consequently the inversion spectrum .",
    "heisenberg uncertainty relation reflects this phenomenon , but information entropy offers a more sensitive approach , to study a particle moving in a non - classical way through the barrier .",
    "information - theoretic tools , initially applied to communication systems , have been employed extensively to investigate various classical and quantum systems e.g. in physics @xcite , chemistry @xcite , biology @xcite and many other scientific branches as well .",
    "specifically , the well - known information measures defined by shannon @xcite and fisher @xcite , have been applied with considerable success in quantum systems e.g. atoms @xcite .",
    "shannon information entropy has been correlated fairly well with experimental data for atomic ionization potentials and dipole polarizabilities @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive account of applications to molecules can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "another example is an information - theoretic treatment of a molecule ( @xmath6-system ) described in @xcite .    to begin with , one needs a probabilistic treatment of a system , which in fact is especially suitable and relevant for quantum systems , and then use the corresponding probability densities , @xmath7 in position space and @xmath8 in momentum space as input to the definitions of shannon information entropy and fisher information .",
    "thus , one proceeds to the calculation of the information content of the system and investigate its related properties .",
    "an additional merit of the probabilistic treatment is that one can calculate quantitatively , in a systematic manner , a measure of complexity of the quantum system , the so - called lmc statistical complexity @xcite .",
    "the lmc complexity of the @xmath9 ion was studied using a simple wavefunction of coulson type , leading to a promising relation of complexity with chemical bonding @xcite .",
    "atomic complexity has been calculated for the first time in the literature in @xcite , where another definition of complexity was employed , namely the sdl measure @xcite .",
    "last but not least , calculations of molecular information entropies were carried out in @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we apply the above methods in order to study the ammonia molecule as a test bed , and in particular to assess the effect of tunneling on the shannon information entropy , the fisher information and the lmc complexity , together with heisenberg s uncertainty .",
    "we employ a simple model for the ammonia molecule , i.e. the double square well potential ( dswp ) , which captures its essential properties required for a probabilistic treatment via the schrdinger equation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ dswp ] ,",
    "we derive the time - dependent wavefunction for the ammonia molecule ( dswp ) , and we also plot the time dependence of probability density in both position and momentum spaces . in section [ iswp ] , we consider the infinite square well potential ( iswp ) , in order to compare the corresponding results of the dswp with a system , where quantum tunneling is absent . in section [ statistical measures ]",
    "we define the relevant statistical measures and present the intrinsic relation among them . in section [ results ]",
    "we illustrate and comment the results i.e. the time evolution of statistical measures for both ammonia molecule ( dswp ) and iswp .",
    "the conclusions of the analysis are drawn in section [ summary and conclusions ] .",
    "the ammonia molecule has the shape of a pyramid where the nitrogen atom is at the apex and the three hydrogen atoms form the base in the shape of an equilateral triangle @xcite .",
    "the position of the nitrogen atom is chosen as the origin of the x axis .",
    "manning potential @xcite constitutes a good approximation of the ammonia molecule potential , which is defined by the function    @xmath10        in the following analysis we replace the manning potential ( fig . [ manning ] ) by the simplified dswp ( fig .",
    "[ dswp - potential ] ) .",
    "dswp in general , is a tractable quantum system which can be solved analytically , and therefore it will be used to illustrate the main features of the actual potential .",
    "we study the quantum motion of a  particle \" representing the collective motion of the three hydrogen atoms .",
    "the mass of this hydrogen plane is equal to @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the mass of a hydrogen atom .",
    "the depth is assumed to be @xmath13 , the height of the central barrier @xmath14 and the maximum distance that the hydrogen plane can take from nitrogen is @xmath15  where @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "adjustments to the length of the wells @xmath17 and @xmath18 have been made , so that the calculated frequencies are in accordance with the ones that have been found experimentally ( @xmath19 ) @xcite .",
    "dswp in the ammonia molecule is defined by the following piecewise function ,    @xmath20    , width=211,height=139 ]    where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath21  and @xmath22  .",
    "the one - dimensional schrdinger equation ( se ) is :    @xmath23    by dividing the @xmath24 axis into five spatial regions , and following the standard procedure @xcite we solve analytically the corresponding second order differential equations , taking into account continuity and smoothness conditions for the wavefunction at @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the potential is an even function of position , i.e. , @xmath27 . due to this symmetry ,",
    "the solutions of the se are either odd or even functions of position .",
    "we solve these equations only for @xmath28 , because only in that case the energy is less than the barrier s height , and so quantum tunneling is possible .",
    "the symmetric ( even ) solution is :    @xmath29    while the antisymmetric one ( odd ) is :    @xmath30    where    @xmath31    in the even case we set @xmath32 , and the values of the constants @xmath33 are obtained by solving the resulting transcendental equation numerically .",
