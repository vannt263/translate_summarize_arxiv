    "the study of low - dimensional magnetic systems made of spin chains attracts much attention for last decades . if the interchain coupling is less than intrachain one , at higher temperatures these systems exhibit properties intrinsic to one - dimensional magnets .",
    "however , at lower temperatures the interchain interaction comes into play and begins to govern a magnetic behavior of the system .",
    "in this work we apply the real space renormalization group ( rsrg ) procedure to the antiferromagnetic heisenberg ( ah )  model of spin @xmath0 on a honeycomb lattice made of antiferromagnetic spin @xmath0 chains with an antiferromagnetic interchain coupling .",
    "we are interested in the critical properties of the 2d system , and explore how the interchain coupling affects the criticality of the model .",
    "simultaneously , we elucidate an effect of an exchange anisotropy on the critical temperature and build the phase diagram of the anisotropic heisenberg ( ah ) model of spin @xmath0 on a honeycomb lattice with two kind of exchange couplings .    first of all , the interest to the problem is motivated by synthesis of a family of related organic biradicals @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 whose magnetic properties have been examined by susceptibility and magnetization measurements @xcite .",
    "each biradical involves two spins of @xmath5 , which are coupled ferromagnetically ( @xmath6 ) . in their turn , these spin pairs couple antiferromagnetically in the crystal .",
    "due to the strong ferromagnetic coupling @xmath6 , antiferromagnetic chains of @xmath0 are seen in both @xmath2 and @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "2(a ) type - i in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "@xmath2 has interchain interactions in three - dimensions ( @xmath7 ) , whereas @xmath4 has two - dimensional ( @xmath8 ) interchain interactions .",
    "@xmath2 is well understood by one - dimensional antiferromagnetic chain model .",
    "the compound undergoes @xmath7 nel order at @xmath9 1 k due to the weak interchain coupling .",
    "the crystal structures of @xmath4 is shown in fig.[structure ] . in the extreme limit of @xmath10 ,",
    "the model becomes equivalent to the coupled antiferromagnetically ( @xmath11 ) antiferromagnetic uniform chains of @xmath0 with the intrachain exchange integral @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath4 with comparable values of two kinds of the antiferromagnetic interactions @xmath12 and @xmath11 forms a @xmath8 system on a honeycomb lattice .",
    "it has been found that a magnetism of @xmath4 is characterized by the singlet ground state and an energy gap above the state .",
    "this finding is supported by the high - field magnetization process which shows a plateau in the magnetization curve .",
    "we have to point out once that a modelling of real spin-@xmath1 system by spin @xmath13 system implies some mistake and one have to apply the results of the rsrg analysis to the real compounds with caution .    the results for the spin-1 lattice may be useful also for the theory of @xmath0 bosons ( ultracold atoms @xmath14 ) trapped in an optical lattice in the regime of one particle per site for suitable interaction between the bosons @xcite .",
    "according to recent quantum monte carlo results for spin-1/2 weakly anisotropic antiferromagnets on the square lattice an ordered low - temperature phase develops for very small anisotropy of order @xmath15 ( in units of exchange coupling ) @xcite .",
    "these results are in contradiction with the rsrgtreatment for the same model predicting considerably larger value of the critical anisotropy ( @xmath16 ) . in view of this discrepancy ,",
    "the rsrg analysis for the @xmath17 case is of a particular theoretical interest and besides it is instructive to compare a critical behavior of systems of integer and half - integer spins .",
    "we mention the results of investigations of ground states of spin-@xmath18 ( spin-@xmath19 ) systems on the hexagonal ( square ) lattice by using vertex state models @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that these systems exhibit an anisotropy - induced second order phase transition from disordered phase with exponential decay of two - spin correlations to the neel order phase with dominant long - range correlations .",
    "the phase transition belongs to the @xmath8 ising - model universality class .    after the rsrg  approach has been applied successfully to study the 2d ising systems @xcite a number of works",
    "have been dedicated to the investigation of phase transitions in quantum systems within the method @xcite .",
    "in last decade , the rsrg methods have been performed to calculate the phase diagram for the anisotropic antiferromagnetic heisenberg ( aah ) model of @xmath5 on the square lattice @xcite .",
    "this approach uses a hierarchical lattice to approximate the square one , and performs a partial trace over internal degrees of freedom .",
    "recently , in order to study weakly interacting classical and quantum spin chains the linear - perturbation real - space renormalization group ( lprg ) method has been suggested @xcite .",
    "the lprg uses the existence of the small parameter  the ratio of interchain to intrachain coupling .",
    "this perturbative method involves rg transformation , which for the ising spins is the standard decimation procedure and for the quantum spins is the generalization of the suzuki - takano approximate decimation @xcite .",
    "however , in practice , the lprg using perturbation theory with the interchain interactions as the perturbation parameters is only reliable for small values of the ratio interchain to intrachain interaction .",
    "we use an extension to @xmath0 case of the quantum rsrg  approach originally suggested by mariz et al . for the @xmath5 ah model @xcite .",
    "an application of the renormalization group  method to interacting quantum spin chains encounters standard difficulties connected with a necessity of a decomposition of the exponential operators , and additional proliferation of the new interactions due to the vector character of the spin operators .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii  the rsrg method is formulated for @xmath0 and applied to the honeycomb lattice formed by interacting antiferromagnetic chains .",
    "our results and conclusions are given in sec .",

    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) describes the ising ( @xmath29 ) , isotropic heisenberg ( @xmath30 ) and xy - model ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "we mention briefly main operations lying in base of the approach of ref .",

    "may be found explicitly @xcite,@xcite .    in order to construct recursion relations of the rg  transformation ( [ rgs ] ) for the spin-@xmath13 model we should expand both sides over an appropriate matrix basis to equate coefficients of the expansion . to avoid a proliferation problem we chose those quantities that correspond to coupling constants in the initial hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) .    due to properties of pauli",
    "matrices the matrix representation for @xmath45 and @xmath46 in the case of spin @xmath1 has the same form , i.e. @xmath45 and @xmath46 have non - zero matrix elements in the same positions . for the @xmath0 this rule does not hold that results in an essential complication of rg procedure .    following the treatment of ref .",
    "@xcite , we expand @xmath47 as    @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the outer product , @xmath50 is ordinary powers of the spin operators @xmath51 and the coefficients @xmath52 depend on @xmath53 and @xmath43 . since , @xmath54 are the @xmath55 matrices we expand them over the basis that consists of the polarization matrices @xmath56 ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) ( see appendix a ) @xmath59 in their turn , the matrices @xmath56 may be written through the spin operators explicitly @xcite @xmath60 @xmath61 , \\;t_{\\pm 2}^2=\\frac 12\\left [ \\left ( s^x\\right ) ^2-\\left ( s^y\\right ) ^2\\pm i\\left ( s_xs_y+s_ys_x\\right ) \\right ] .\\ ] ] the transformation @xmath62 should preserve the symmetry of the hamiltonian @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the requirement of invariance gives the most general form @xmath63 @xmath64 with a new set of coupling parameters @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "for the hamiltonian ( [ h12eff ] ) the above formula gives @xmath71 where the matrix elements are @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76    similarly , we obtain the closed expression for the expansion of @xmath77 akin to that of @xmath78 with the coefficients in the expansion ( [ expan ] ) are functions of the parameters coming into @xmath79 ( see appendix b for details ) .    to calculate the exponentials",
    "we will diagonalize numerically the @xmath80 and @xmath81 matrices associated with @xmath82 and @xmath79 . by using @xmath83 where @xmath84 are the unitary matrices turning @xmath85 into the diagonal forms @xmath86",
    ", we can find numerically @xmath87 and @xmath88 as functions of corresponding coupling parameters .",
    "the same matrix structure ( [ struct ] ) of @xmath78 and @xmath89 is supported by the numerical calculation .",
    "the numerical procedure produces a set @xmath90 for @xmath78 and @xmath91 for tr@xmath92 . to obtain the required rg equations we impose    @xmath93    @xmath94    @xmath95    and @xmath96 the number of these equations exceeds the number of interactions that enter into the hamiltonian ( [ h12eff ] ) because all possible bilinear couplings between terminal sites come into play .",
    "thus , in order to carry out the rgdecimation we retain the three equations ( [ rg1],[rg2],[rg3 ] ) which implicitly determine @xmath53 and @xmath43 as functions of @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "this set of equations is a counterpart of rg relations for the case of @xmath5 ( see eqs.(12 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "now , we have to chose an appropriate hierarchical lattice .",
    "we take one of the simplest cells , conserving a point symmetry of the full lattice , with @xmath97 sites and @xmath97 bonds , depicted in fig.[graph ] .",
    "we then impose that the correlation function between the two terminal sites @xmath42 and @xmath97 of the original and renormalized graphs are preserved . at the first step we apply decimation ,",
    "the spins @xmath13 and @xmath42 ( or @xmath98 and @xmath97 ) survive whereas the spins @xmath19 and @xmath99 are removed . at the second step",
    "the decimation procedure is repeated removing the spins @xmath13 and @xmath98 . finally , to obtain the renormalized parameters we apply migdal - kadanoff bond moving combining the  pieces  in parallel , which leads to the recursion relations @xmath100    we have evaluated numerically the renormalization transformation from the original set of coupling parameters to the set of renormalized parameters .",
    "critical points are then evaluated as non - trivial fixed points of the above relations which can be rewritten as the composite function @xmath101    unlike to the case of @xmath5 we can not obtain rg  relations explicitly . instead of this , we briefly outline the numerical procedure .",
    "input fixed parameters are the ratio of interchain to intrachain coupling @xmath102 and the anisotropic parameter @xmath103 and what s more @xmath104 ( the feature of anisotropy is the same both for the intrachain and interchain couplings ) .",
    "at given starting value @xmath105 of the intrachain coupling ( then the interchain coupling is @xmath106 ) we apply two successive decimation steps to produce a renormalized coupling @xmath107 . during each of the step",
    "we solve eqs.([rg1],[rg2],[rg3 ] ) using the standard routine for non - linear systems of equations @xcite .",
    "then , we double the result obtained after these transformations to get a final value @xmath108 depending on the starting value @xmath105 . to complete we find a fixed point @xmath109 of the equation @xmath110 by using bisection method .",
    "the critical inverse temperature @xmath111 as a function of @xmath112 for several @xmath113 values is presented in fig.[critcoupl ] . as seen , the critical temperature rapidly decreases when the interchain coupling becomes weaker .",
    "our results for the critical temperature as a function of the anisotropy @xmath113 are shown in fig.[critanis ] .",
    "the universality class for the whole critical curve is the same as for the ising model .",
    "by contrast to some rsrg calculations for @xmath5 the phase diagrams for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic models are the same : the critical temperature reaches zero at a critical value of @xmath113 , @xmath114 , which is greater than zero .",
    "the weaker interchain coupling the stronger quantum fluctuations .",
    "so , as one could expect , the @xmath114 value is larger if the @xmath112 shifts to lower values .    for the lowest temperatures we could work we have observed no sign of the reentrant behavior found in some previous rgrs treatments .",
    "the nel temperature behaves as @xmath115 near @xmath116 that agrees with the result found for the case @xmath5 .",
    "our calculation can not be carried out down to @xmath117 ; therefore we can not make any definite conclusions about the ground state of the model .",
    "the scaling law holds for different values of the ratio of interchain to intrachain coupling ( fig.[scaling ] ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the logarithmic dependence of @xmath118 and @xmath119 with respect to @xmath120 is established using scaling arguments with @xmath121 .",
    "recent quantum monte carlo results @xcite for the anisotropic 2d @xmath5 heisenberg model have shown that it develops an ordered low - temperature phase even for very small anisotropies @xmath122 .",
    "the latter gives strong evidence of large values of a critical anisotropy is an artifact of the real - space renormalization approach .    at this point",
    ", it is worthwhile to compare our results with those from rgrs calculations for antiferromagnetic ah model of @xmath5 on a square lattice .",
    "these rsrg analysises lead to non - equivalence between the criticality of the ferromagnetic ( f ) and antiferromagnetic ( af ) models , a reentrant behavior in the ( @xmath123 , @xmath113 ) diagram @xcite .",
    "it is well known that in classical spin models , such as as the ising or classical heisenberg models , on bipartite lattices the critical temperature is the same for ferromagnetic exchange ( curie temperature ) as for antiferromagnetic exchange ( neel temperature ) .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the free energy being an even function of the exchange parameter . however , for the quantum spin @xmath1 heisenberg model the curie and neel temperatures are unequal @xcite .",
    "recently , this question has been reinvestigated using high - temperature series expansions for the spin @xmath1 , @xmath124 and @xmath18 heisenberg ferromagnet and antiferromagnet in @xmath42-dimensions @xcite .",

    "the results for the antiferromagnetic exchange are very similar to the @xmath131 case , there is no long - range nel order for the anisotropy parameter @xmath132 . the question is not yet settled and more work is needed to put these points on firmer grounds .",
    "an observation of reentrance behavior for the spin 1/2 antiferromagnetic ah model on the square lattice has been reported by some authors @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that there is an ordered phase at relatively high temperature but not at very low temperature . a full understanding of this phenomena is still lacking , but it s most likely the reentrance behavior is an artifact of the rgrs method . in refs .",
