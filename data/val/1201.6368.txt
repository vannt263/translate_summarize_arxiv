    "long  anticipated discovery  @xcite of a higgs  like particle brings us face - to - face with major challenge of comprehending in detail the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking  @xcite . an interesting option potentially leading to composite higgs",

    "the latter is usually represented by a gauge theory with chiral symmetry @xmath2 which breaks down to @xmath3 in qcd - like manner ; @xmath4 is the number of techniflavors .",
    "electroweak symmetry is a gauged @xmath5 subgroup of the chiral group , so it is broken due to chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "unfortunately , the simplest , literally drawn from qcd technicolor models were ruled out long ago , as they predict unacceptably large values of the peskin - takeuchi  @xcite @xmath0 parameter .",
    "this leaves open  @xcite a `` walking '' version  @xcite which , however , lacks contact with the phenomenological information accumulated by hadron physics .",
    "the gauge / gravity holographic duality  @xcite enters at this stage as an approach to studying technicolor models in terms of their weakly coupled gravity duals in five dimensions  @xcite . using the holographic dictionary  @xcite ,",

    "this promotes the global @xmath12 symmetry of the original model to the gauge symmetry of the holographic dual .",
    "the problem of computing current correlators then reduces to that of solving classical equations for the dual fields .    since dual descriptions of realistic technicolor theories are unknown ( see , however , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , one tends to adopt a bottom - up approach  @xcite trying to guess the field content and lagrangian of the five - dimensional dual model on phenomenological grounds . to this end",
    "one introduces new fields besides @xmath10 and @xmath11 , for instance , an @xmath13 bifundamental scalar @xmath14 representing techniquark condensate  @xcite .",
    "one also selects appropriate conditions at the boundaries of the 5d space and allows for departures from the @xmath15 geometry  @xcite .",
    "the price to pay is the absence of an ultraviolet completion of the model which therefore has the status of an effective theory below a certain uv cutoff .",
    "this simple picture is far from being justified in any rigorous sense .",
    "nevertheless , one hopes that such models capture essential features of strongly coupled dynamics and therefore serve as good toy models for technicolor theories .    in this letter",
    "we derive a new constraint on a class of holographic technicolor models , namely , those  @xcite containing two @xmath16 gauge fields @xmath10 , @xmath11 and bifundamental @xmath14 .",
    "the fields live in an interval in the warped fifth dimension , with boundary conditions to be specified below .",
    "we show that weakly coupled description of these holographic models implies large values of @xmath0 parameter .",
    "namely , @xmath17 , otherwise : ( i ) the uv cutoff drops below @xmath18 ; ( ii ) correlators of electroweak currents with momenta exceeding the uv cutoff are sensitive to strongly coupled sector of the 5d theory and therefore not tractable ; ( iii ) no reliable predictions for the spectrum can be made .",
    "properties ( i)(iii ) degrade the status of the holographic technicolor models to that of theories with massive @xmath19 bosons and no higgs mechanism : the latter are also strongly coupled above a few @xmath20 . on the other hand ,",

    "the conditions  ( [ eq:4 ] ) and vacuum @xmath40 are preserved by the diagonal gauge transformations with @xmath41 and @xmath42 , so the diagonal subgroup @xmath3 remains unbroken .",
    "we do not consider theories  @xcite with explicit breaking of gauge invariance in the bulk and accidentally enlarged gauge symmetry at the quadratic level , as these properties generically lead to pathologies : strong coupling at all scales , ghosts , etc .",
