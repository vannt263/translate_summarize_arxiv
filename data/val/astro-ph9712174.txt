    "helioseismology allows us to look into the deep interior of the sun , probably more efficiently than with neutrinos .",
    "the highly precise measurements of frequencies and the tremendous number of measured lines enable us to extract the values of sound speed inside the sun with accuracy better than 1% .",
    "recently it was demonstrated that a comparable accuracy can be obtained for the inner core of the sun @xcite .",
    "the present work summarizes the results of our group in the last year concernig a systematic analysis of helioseismic implications on solar structure and neutrino production .",

    "this analysis provided the base for quantitative tests of solar models .",

    "[ secssm ] ) we shall confront with helioseismology the predictions of standard solar models ( ssms ) .",
    "these tests are really a big success of recent ssms , _ including _ elements diffusion , so that one can gain further confidence in the predicted central solar temperature and @xmath11 and neutrino fluxes @xmath12 .",
    "however , one can take a somehow different attitude .",
    "the richness of helioseismic data can be used so as to supply information on some of the less certain inputs of solar models (  solar opacity ) .",

    "[ sechcsm ] .    from the analysis of hcsms",
    "it comes out that @xmath11 can be predicted with an accuracy of about one percent , a result obtained even if some of the most controversial assumptions of ssm are released .",
    "this result contradicts recently advocated non - standard solar models , build so as to significantly decrease @xmath11 .",

    "traditional and still most important helioseismic observables are frequencies of normal modes of solar oscillations .",
    "this is unlike in geophysical seismic sounding where the primary data are travel times of seismic waves .",
    "a possibility of measuring the wave travel times in the sun has been discovered not long ago @xcite .",
    "the travel time data have been successfully applied to probing subsurface flows @xcite .",
    "the possibility of sounding short lived phenomena localized in the subsurface layers is the advantage over the sounding based on the frequency data . here , however , we are interested in sounding mean and solar structure and therefore we will not discuss further this new method .    the frequencies of solar oscillations are deduced from time series of the intensity or radial velocity data .",
    "the latter are much more frequently used .",
    "long - time continuous monitoring is essential for precise frequency determination .",
    "four ground - based networks of automatic telescopes devoted to helioseismic observations are currently operated .",
    "the bison @xcite and iris @xcite networks measure radial velocity variations for the unresolved solar images . with this method , only modes of low spherical harmonic degrees ( @xmath13)are detectable .",
    "the gong @xcite and ton @xcite networks use imaging instruments allowing to detect modes up to @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "there are three seismic instruments on the board of the soho spacecraft which started operation at the beginning of 1996 .",
    "the golf @xcite instrument is similar to that used by iris .",
    "the loi instrument @xcite , which measures intensity variation , has a capability for detecting modes with @xmath16 .",
    "the third is mdi , which an imaging instrument @xcite . in the continuous mode of operation",
    "it detects modes up to @xmath17 .",
    "data for seismic probing from the imaging instruments are usually provided in the form of centroid frequencies , @xmath18 , and splitting coefficients , @xmath19 , for the @xmath20 multiplets , where @xmath21 denotes radial order of the mode .",
    "the coefficients describe the azimuthal dependence in oscillation frequencies according to the following relation @xmath22 where subscripts @xmath21 and @xmath23 denote radial and azimuthal orders , respectively , and functions @xmath24 are @xmath25-order orthogonal polynomials .",
    "data from the gong network and from the mdi instrument provide values of @xmath26 and six @xmath27 coefficients for over 2000 @xmath28 multiplets . for smaller number of multiplets the coefficients up to @xmath29 are available in the data sets from the mdi instrument .",
    "values of @xmath27 s reveal that the interior rotation rate is not very different from the surface rate and that the sun is a very slowly rotating and almost perfectly spherical star .",
    "this fact significantly simplifies interpretation of the data . in particular , the quantities @xmath26 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are separate probes of , respectively , the radial structure , the differential rotation and the asphericity .",
    "the possibility of sounding internal rotation is of great importance for understanding mechanism of the solar magnetic activity changing in the 11-year cycle .",
    "the data reveal that the differential rotation observed in the surface persists through the convective zone ( some outer 30% in the radius ) .",
    "the transition to essentially uniform rotation takes place in the narrow zone , which has been the suggested site of the solar dynamo @xcite .",
    "an important result in the context of this review is that there is no evidence for the rotation increase toward the center .",
    "in fact , according to some studies ( e.g. @xcite ) there is a seismic evidence for lower rotation rate in the core than in outer layers . in any case",
    "the dynamical effect of centrifugal force is certainly negligible .",
    "there is also no evidence for a significant role of magnetic field in the sun s interior .",
    "[ tb ]    we now focus on the centroid frequencies and , as an example , on the data from the mdi / soho instrument .",
    "the frequencies with the error bars are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1w ] .",
    "the accuracy , which at the low frequencies is @xmath32 , visibly deteriorates at higher frequencies .",
    "the peaks in this part of the oscillation amplitude spectra are considerably broader , which is connected with the shorter life - time of the higher frequency modes .",
    "the total number of frequency data in the figure is 2047 .",
    "the @xmath33 branch represents fundamental modes which are horizontally propagating waves obeying the same dispersion as surface waves in deep water .",
    "their frequencies are fully determined by mean density in the sun .",
    "the @xmath34 branches represent p - modes which are standing acoustic ( pressure ) waves .",
    "these waves begin their downward propagation from the surface , where they are reflected , as nearly vertical rays . as a result of increasing adiabatic sound speed ( @xmath35 ) ,",
    "the rays become gradually more oblique and , eventually , are reflected at the surface where the sound speed satisfies the condition @xmath36 .    only a small fraction of p - modes from fig .",
    "[ fig1w ] penetrates the energy producing core . at @xmath37 mhz and @xmath38 ,",
    "the inner reflection surface occurs at @xmath39 , which is close to the maximum the differential @xmath40b - neutrino flux of and well beneath the maximum of the differential photon flux .",
    "however , at a similar frequency and @xmath41 the reflection takes place at @xmath42 , where the photon flux is already more than 92% of the total solar luminosity . even for the low degree modes the frequencies are mainly sensitive to the structure of the outer layers",
    "the modes which are very sensitive to the core structure are g - modes . their frequencies , however , are below 0.43 mhz and we may only hope that the solar g - modes will be some times detected .",
    "[ tb ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig2w ] we show the relative differences in frequency between the sun and one of the standard solar models .",
    "similar patterns are found for other models .",
    "the differences are small in the sense that there is no ambiguity in assigning the @xmath21 value . however , they exceed the measurement errors frequently by two orders of magnitude .",
    "thus , they are very significant and must be explained . in the case of the f - modes",
    "almost all the difference may be removed by an adjustment of the model radius @xcite .",
    "solar seismic radius is by 0.045% less than adopted in the model . for higher order p -",
    "modes the difference between model and solar frequencies rapidly increases with @xmath43 .",
    "this immediately suggests that most of the difference between the model and the sun must be localized in outermost layers .",
    "higher @xmath43 implies a higher @xmath44 at the lower reflecting surface and therefore a greater confinement to outer layers .",
    "we know that our treatment of the structure and oscillations in outer layers is inadequate .",
    "the problem is how to take into account effects of vigorous and nonadiabatic convection .",
    "we expect the problem concerns the layers above @xmath45 , where p - modes propagate almost vertically and the local properties are @xmath43-independent .",
    "this implies that the part of the frequency difference may be modeled in the form @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the calculated mode inertia assuming uniform normalization and @xmath48 should be determined from the data .",
    "it is found that for modern standard solar models this part dominates in @xmath49 but we are interested only in the small contribution arising in the rest of the interior .    in the deeper layers the neglect of dynamical effects of convection",
    "is fully justified .",
    "furthermore , the nonadiabatic effects in oscillations , which have not been taken into account in calculation of frequencies used in fig . [ fig2w ] , are certainly negligible below @xmath45 . in view of the small values of @xmath50 , linearization",
    "about the reference standard model seems justified .",
    "thus , we may use the variational principle for adiabatic stellar oscillations to connect the frequency difference to the differences in structural functions between the sun and its model .",
    "our aim is to determine these differences . in general",
    ", we have to consider simultaneously two unknown functions of @xmath44 . for one",
    "the choices are differences in density , @xmath51 , pressure @xmath52 , or any combination of them or their derivatives .",
    "all such functions are linked by linearized hydrostatic condition .",
    "we use here @xmath5 . for the other thermodynamic function the choices",
    "are the adiabatic exponent @xmath53 or squared adiabatic sound speed , @xmath54 .",
    "the problem is simplified if we make use the @xmath55 relation , where @xmath56 is the fractional helium abundance , from the astrophysical equation of state data .",
    "( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . since in the chemically inhomogeneous interior the we may safely neglect @xmath57 ,",
    "the problem may be reduced to determination of the function @xmath58 and the number @xmath59y@xmath60 the abundance of he in the layers above the base of the convective zone . in this way",
    "the basic equation for seismic probing of the internal structure becomes : @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "the kernel @xmath63 and numbers @xmath64 , @xmath65 are easily evaluated in terms of the eigenfunctions for adiabatic oscillations in the standard solar model .    this equation may be applied to all p - modes .",
    "thus , we have a large set of the integral equations to determine the two functions and the y@xmath60 .",
    "methods of determination of @xmath66 were described in details in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there are two distinct approaches .",
    "the first is the regularized least squares ( rls ) method which consists in a discretization in terms of known function and a determination of parameters by means of minimization of the @xmath67-squared fit plus an integral term that smooths artificial oscillation .",
    "the other is the optimal averaging method which consists in seeking linear combination of individual kernels which are close to possibly narrow gaussians centered at specified distances @xmath44",
    ". corresponding combination of frequency differences yields the averaged values of @xmath66 weighted with these localized kernels . fig .",
    "[ fig3w ] shows that the results obtained with these methods agree in a good agreement .",
    "once we know @xmath58 we may determine @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 making no additional assumptions . hence we get seismic values of these three parametrs in the whole solar interior . at this stage",
    "we can determine the value @xmath44 at the base of the convective , @xmath71 , as well as the temperature @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "what we can not find is @xmath72 @xmath74 profiles in the radiative interior .",
    "in order to disentangle the two last functions , which are of course most interesting in the context of the solar neutrino problem , we have to use data on the opacities and the nuclear reaction rates .",
    "this has been done ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for references to the original work ) but we will not pursue this way here . rather , we rely on directly inferred quantities as constraints on solar models .    we see in fig .",
    "[ fig3w ] that the relative differences in @xmath75 are less than @xmath76 in the whole @xmath77r_\\odot$ ] range of @xmath44 .",
    "this agreement is very unlikely accidental and , thus , we regard it as a confirmation of the standard model of the solar evolution . in the outer part of the convective zone",
    "the agreement is worse but it may be easily improved by admissible modifications in the description of the convective energy transfer . beneath @xmath78",
    "we just do not have enough information to make any statement .",
    "the small differences in the intermediate region may be eliminated by introducing _",
    "ad hoc _ opacity modifications which are within the uncertainty of its calculation @xcite .",
    "however , the bump in @xmath66 near the bottom of the convective envelope may have another cause .",
    "richard et al .",
    "@xcite showed that this feature may be removed if one allows a weak rotation - induced mixing of elements below the bottom of the convective envelope .",
    "the effect was considered as a possible explanation of the deficiency of lithium in the sun s atmosphere .",
    "mixing brings lithium to deeper layers where it burns .",
    "it also results in a reduction efficiency of the gravitational settling leading to somewhat higher y@xmath60 in the convective zone .",
    "thus , the same effect may also explain the seismic correction to the photospheric he abundance ( @xmath59 y@xmath79 ) .    ",

    "we performed a systematic and possibly exhaustive investigation of the uncertainties of the helioseismic approach , in order to estimate the global error to be assigned to helioseismic determinations of solar properties . with this spirit , we analyse several physical quantities @xmath80 characterizing the solar structure .",
    "concerning the outer part of the sun , we discuss the photospheric helium abundance y@xmath60 , the depth of the the convective envelope @xmath71 , and the density at the bottom of the convective zone @xmath81 .",
    "then we consider the  intermediate \" solar interior ( @xmath82=@xmath83 ) , analysing the behaviour of the squared isothermal sound speed , = @xmath84 .",
    "finally we investigate the inner region ( @xmath85 ) , where nuclear energy and neutrinos are produced .",
    "we remind see the previous section that helioseismology measures _ only _ the frequencies \\{@xmath86 } of solar p - modes , and quantities characterizing the solar structure are indirectly inferred from the \\{@xmath86 } s , through an inversion method .",
    "schematically , the procedure is the following :    a)one starts with a solar model , giving values @xmath87 and predicting a set \\{@xmath88 } of frequencies",
    ". these will be somehow different from the measured frequencies , @xmath89    b)one then searches for the corrections @xmath90 to the solar model which are needed in order to match the corresponding frequencies \\{@xmath91 } with the observed frequencies \\{@xmath92}. expression for @xmath93 are derived by using perturbation theory , where the starting model is used as a zero - th order approximation .",
    "the correction factors @xmath90 are then computed , assuming some regularity properties , so that the problem is mathematically well defined and/or unphysical solutions are avoided .",
    "c)the `` helioseismic value '' @xmath94 is thus determined by adding the starting value and the correction : indicates the correction to solar model to obtain helioseimic value ( see eq .",

    "in fact , there are three independent sources of errors in the inversion process :    i)errors on the measured frequencies , which  for a given inversion procedure ",
    "propagate on the value of @xmath94 .",
    "ii)residual dependence on the starting model : the resulting @xmath94 is slightly different if one starts with different solar models .",
    "this introduces an additional uncertainty , which can be evaluated by comparing the results of several calculations .",
    "iii)uncertainty in the regularization procedure .",
    "essentially this is a problem of extrapolation / parametrization .",
    "different methods , equally acceptable in principle , yield ( slightly ) different values of @xmath94 .",

    ", we took a very conservative approach .",
    "may be that the parameter variation was not exhaustive , and what we found as extrema are not really so , but actually are quite acceptable values . in view of this , let us double the interval we found and interpret @xmath98 , as partial errors .",
    "furthermore , let us be really _ conservative _ assuming that errors add up linearly . in conclusion",
    ", this gives : @xmath99    in the following sections , we shall use this error estimate .",
    "three independent physical properties of the convective envelope are determined most accuratelly by seismic observations , see ref.@xcite : y@xmath60 , @xmath71 and @xmath81 .",
    "the helioseismic predictions , together with their ( conservatively estimated ) accuracy , are shown in table [ tabq ] .",
    "we remark that for all these quantities the uncertainty resulting from propagation of the frequency measurement errors is of minor importance with respect to the `` systematic '' errors , intrinsic to the inversion method .",
    "the essential output of helioseismology is the reconstruction of the adiabatic sound speed profile , @xmath35 .",

    "( see sect .",
    "[ secw ] ) it is possible to derive directly the profile of @xmath75 as a function of the radial coordinate throughout all the sun , except for the inner region ( @xmath104 ) . the results ( values of @xmath75 and global errors ) ,",
    "are summarized in table [ tabq ] .",
    "it is convenient to consider an intermediate solar region : @xmath105 .",
    "the upper limit is established by requiring that it is well below the transition to the convective zone , which we discussed above .",
    "the lower limit is chosen so as to exclude the region of energy production ( see next subsection ) .",
    "for this region the following comments are relevant :    a)each of the individual uncertainties nowhere exceeds 2  .",
    "b)uncertainties from the accuracy on the measured frequencies are of minor relevance with respect to the residual model dependence and to the sensitivity to the inversion parameters , see fig .",

    "c)all in all , even with the most conservative estimates , the helioseismic determination is extremely accurate : @xmath106 throughout the explored region .",

    "our results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and table [ tabq ] .",
    "clearly the precision worsens in this region , due to the fact that p - modes do not penetrate in the solar core , and consequently the information one can extract from available experimental results is limited , but still important .",
    "for example , at the production maxima of @xmath108be and @xmath40b neutrinos ( @xmath109 and @xmath110 according to our best solar model with diffusion @xcite ) the global accuracy is still a 2% , see table [ tabq ] .",

    ", these uncertainties do not correspond to clear experimental or observational errors , rather they are determined by judicious comparison among published values . as an example , the uncertainty on @xmath127 can only be estimated from the comparison among recent theoretical calculations .",
    "we allowed that both @xmath127 and z / x are _ rescaled by free multiplicative factors _ with respect to the value used in th ssm .",

    "one sees that reduction of intermediate ( @xmath108be+cno ) and/or high ( @xmath40b ) energy neutrino fluxes is only achieved for @xmath151 .",
    "similar conclusions hold for the other mixing mechanisms mentioned above , see ref .",
    "@xcite .    in brief ,",
    "_ reduction of @xmath108be and @xmath40b neutrino fluxes can only be obtained for extended mixing regions _ ( @xmath151 ) , _ corresponding to solar models inconsistent with helioseismic constraints_.    we remind that the one percent accuracy of helioseismic information at @xmath152 is an essential ingredient for achieving this result .",
    "as another example illustrating the potential of the helioseismic approach we discuss the p+p@xmath153d+e@xmath154+@xmath155 reaction .",
    "the rate of the initial reaction in the pp chain is too low to be directly measured in the laboratory ( even in the solar center this rate is extremely small , clearly of the order of 10@xmath156 yr@xmath157 ) and it can be determined only by using the theory of low energy weak interactions , together with the measured properties of the deuteron and of the proton - proton scattering . while we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite for updated reviews , we remind that , as input of ssm calculations , one takes @xcite @xmath158 .",
    "we remark however that only theoretical estimates of @xmath159 are available and observational information would be welcome . in this respect",
    ", it is interesting to determine the range of @xmath160 which is acceptable in comparison with helioseismology .    in sect .",
    "[ sechcsm ] we pointed that there are two major uncertainties in building ssms : solar opacity @xmath127 and heavy element abundance @xmath161z / x are only known with an accuracy of about @xmath162 10% . by using now @xmath163 , @xmath164 and as @xmath159 free parameters , we can determine the acceptable range of @xmath159 by requiring that @xmath165 and y@xmath60 are all predicted within the helioseismic range .",
    "the dependence of these quantities on @xmath127 , @xmath164 and @xmath160 has been determined numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "most of the information on @xmath159 arises from data on @xmath81 as this observable depends strongly on @xmath160 whereas it is weakly affected by the others parameters .",
    "one can understand the dependence on @xmath159 , at least qualitatively . a value of @xmath159 larger than @xmath166 implies smaller temperatures in the solar interior , which thus becomes more opaque ( in other words , the region of partial ionization is deeper ) .",
    "radiative transport therefore is less efficient and convection starts deeper in the sun ( @xmath167 ) , where density is higher ( @xmath168 ) .    by restricting to the allowed ranges for the properties of the convective envelope ,",
    "see table [ tabq ] , also taking into account the predictions of different ssms , we find : @xmath169    in conclusion , we remark that helioseismology provides the only observational constraint , although indirect , on the p+p @xmath153 d + e@xmath154 + @xmath155 reaction .    incidentally , we observe that this analysis completely excludes the value @xmath170 , recently found in ref .",
    "@xcite , by using a too rough description of the low energy pp scattering data , see also ref .",
    "the helioseismic observation of the sun will continue and the accuracy of the frequency data will improve . for solar physicists",
    "most hope is connected with the possibility of studying changes during the coming maximum of the magnetic activity .",
    "astronomers interesed in the angular evolution are looking forward to new data which should tell us whether indeed solar core rotates slower than the outer layers .",
    "this is so strange that most of them hesitate to believe it now .",
    "we do not expect revelations as far as internal structure is concerned .",
    "the chances to find something that would shake the standard model of stellar evolution seem very small .",
    "unquestionably , however , there is a room for improvement and helioseismology may help .",
    "as a few examples of relevance to calculation of precise solar models for evaluation of the neutrino fluxes as well to modeling evolution of other stars , we briefly outline a few topics we are presently working on .      from the knowledge of @xmath5 along the solar profile , by using the hydrostatic equilibrium equation",
    ", one can extract the solar density ( see   @xcite ) .",
    "we performed a systematic analysis of the uncertainties so as to provide a quantitative estimate of the accuracy @xmath171 , the preliminary result being presented in fig .",
    "[ figrho ] .",
    "we remark that accurate predictions of the solar density , are important for determining the @xmath172 transition probability in neutrino oscillation models where neutrino conversion is due to matter effects , see  @xcite .      as remarked above ,",
    "solar opacity @xmath173 is the more uncertain _ ingredient _ of solar models . by using the additional information provided by helioseismology one can try to transform it into an _ output _ of frequencies measurements",
    "the idea is as follows : as we know @xmath5 , we have one more information on solar structure , and we can use one of the equations of stellar equilibrium / evolution for getting @xmath127 .",
    "in fact , in the region beyond the energy producing core and below the convective envelope ( @xmath4 ) one can use the radiative transport equation in the form : @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the solar luminosity . in the same region the perfect gas equation ( for fully ionized h and he and for neutral z ) holds to high accuracy and the ( almost ) uniform abundance of he and z can be inferred from the observed properties of the solar photosphera . in this way",
    "temperature gradients can be expressed in terms of gradients of @xmath75 ( again determined from helioseismology ) so that the photon mean free path , @xmath176 , can be extracted , possibly with a few per cent accuracy .",
    "already two decades ago , kacharov  @xcite and clayton  @xcite , speculated that the high energy tail of the distribution of protons in the solar core could depart from the maxwell exponential form , @xmath177\\ ] ] as an attempt to reduce the prediction of @xmath40b neutrino flux by invoking a depletion in the number of protons with energy high enough to be captured by @xmath108be nuclei .",
    "in fact , sub barrier nuclear reaction provide a good laboratory for testing the high energy tail of the distribution , as they involve particles near the gamow peak @xmath178 , which is generally larger than the average thermal energy @xmath179 .",
    "tiny deviation from the maxwellian distribution , undetectable near @xmath179 , would be amplified at higher energies , see eq .",
    "[ eqmax ] .",
    "clearly this also holds for the basic p+p@xmath153 e@xmath154+@xmath181 reaction . as we discussed in sect .",
    "[ secspp ] , its rate can be constrained by helioseismology . in the same way",
