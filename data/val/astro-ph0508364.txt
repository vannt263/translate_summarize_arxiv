    "the presence in the universe today of a stochastic background of gravitational waves ( gws ) is a quite general prediction of several early cosmology scenarios .",
    "in fact , the production of gravitons is the outcome of many processes that could have occurred in the early phases of the cosmological evolution .",
    "notable examples of this kind of processes include the amplification of vacuum fluctuations in inflationary@xcite and pre - big - bang cosmology scenarios@xcite , phase transitions@xcite , and finally the oscillation of cosmic strings loops@xcite . in most of these cases ,",
    "the predicted spectrum of gravitational waves extends over a very large range of frequencies ; for example , inflationary expansion produces a flat spectrum that spans more than 20 orders of magnitude in frequency , going from @xmath4 to @xmath5 hz .",
    "the detection of such primordial gravitational waves , produced in the early universe , would be a major breakthrough in cosmology and high energy physics .",
    "this is because gravitons decouple from the cosmological plasma at very early times , when the temperature of the universe is of the order of the planck energy . in this way ,",
    "relic gravitational waves provide us a `` snapshot '' of the universe near the planck time , in a similar way as the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) images the universe at the time of recombination .",
    "the extremely low frequency ( elf ) region ( @xmath6 ) in the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves can be probed through the anisotropies of the cmbr . in particular , gravitational waves leave a distinct imprint in the so - called magnetic or b - modes of its polarization field@xcite . the amplitude of the primordial spectrum of gravitational waves is usually parameterized through the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath7 , i.e. , the ratio between the amplitudes of the initial spectra of the tensor and scalar perturbations in the metric .",
    "the planck satellite@xcite , scheduled for launch in 2007 , is expected to be sensitive@xcite to @xmath8 .",
    "the lower limit corresponds to a density parameter @xmath9 as faint as @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is the dimensionless hubble constant ) in the elf range .",
    "although this value looks incredibly small , it should be noted that , in order to produce such an amount in the framework of inflationary models ( that at present time represent the most promising way to produce a signal in the region under consideration ) , a very early ( starting at @xmath12 sec ) inflation is required , and this possibility looks , from a theoretical point of view , quite unnatural .",
    "future experiments are expected to enhance the sensitivity of two orders of magnitude@xcite .    on the other hand the planned large scale interferometric",
    "gw detectors , although designed with the aim to detect astrophysical signals , can possibly also detect signals of cosmological origin@xcite .",
    "they give complementary information with respect of the cmbr polarization field since , even if their sensitivity is by no means comparable to the one than can be reached by cmbr polarization experiments , nevertheless they probe a different region in the frequency domain that would not be accessible to those ones . in particular the ground - based interferometers , such as the ligo@xcite , virgo@xcite , geo600@xcite and tama300@xcite experiments ,",
    "operate in the range @xmath13 , and are expected to be sensitive to @xmath14 .",
    "even more interesting is the lisa space interferometer@xcite , that will probably operate from 2013 to 2018 .",
    "not being hampered by the earth seismic noise , it will probe the frequency region between @xmath15 and @xmath16 and will in principle be able to detect @xmath17 at @xmath18 . according to theoretical predictions",
    ", a large enough gw signal at this frequencies can be produced , with the appropriate choice of parameters , by a pre - big - bang accelerated expansion , by the oscillation of cosmic strings , or by the electroweak phase transition occurring at @xmath19 .    in order to compare the theoretical predictions with the expected instrument sensitivities",
    ", one needs to evolve the gws from the time of their production to the present .",
    "it is usually assumed that gravitons propagate in vacuum , i.e. , they freely stream across the universe . in this case , the only effect on a propagating gw is a change in frequency ( corresponding to the usual redshift of the graviton energy caused by the expansion of the universe ) , while the intensity of the wave remains the same .",
    "however , gws are sourced by the anisotropic stress part of the energy - momentum tensor of matter , so that the vacuum approximation is well - motivated only when this can be neglected .",
    "it is already known that the anisotropic stress of free streaming neutrinos acts as an effective viscosity , absorbing gravitational waves in the elf region , thus resulting in a damping of the b - modes of cmbr@xcite .",
    "the aim of this letter is to understand if something similar happens in other regions of the frequency domain . in particular , we consider gws that enter the horizon before the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) .",
    "this corresponds to an observable frequency today @xmath0 , i.e. , to all waves possibly detectable by interferometers . in order to study this issue",
    ", we solve the boltzmann equation for the distribution function of cosmological neutrinos and use its formal solution to obtain an integral expression for the anisotropic stress of neutrinos .",
    "we follow the approach outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , but we have to take into account the interactions of neutrinos with other background particles . the anisotropic stress is then inserted as an integral source term in the einstein equation for the evolution of tensor metric perturbations . in the limit of very short neutrino",
    "mean free path , relevant for waves well below a frequency of @xmath20 , this equation can be cast in purely differential form and a numerical solution be sought with standard methods .",
    "we find that the intensity of gws is reduced to @xmath21 of its value in vacuum , its exact value depending only on one physical parameter , namely the density fraction of neutrinos .",
    "neither the wave frequency nor the detail of neutrino interaction affect the value of the absorbed intensity , resulting in an universal behaviour in the frequency range considered .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : prop ] basic statements are provided in order to formulate the dynamical problem ; in particular the coupled einstein - boltzmann system is discussed in correspondence to the interaction between gw and neutrino plasma . moreover , a detailed analysis of the perturbative anisotropic stress tensor together with the optical depth is presented . in section [ sec : abs ] , we develop the real calculation of the gw absorption by neutrinos , by virtue of an approximation scheme of the source term , based on the fast interaction rate of neutrinos .",
    "the time behaviour of the transmitted gw intensity is numerically determined , and its dependence on the neutrino content of the universe outlined . in section [ sec : conc ] , concluding remarks follow in order to stress the phenomenological relevance of our analysis , with respect to gw interferometric detectors .",
    "we shall use , all throughout the paper , natural units in which @xmath22 .    let us consider a gravitational wave , propagating on the background of a flat friedmann universe . in synchronous gauge ,",
    "the spatial components of the perturbed metric are written as : @xmath23\\ ] ] while the other components are left unperturbed : @xmath24 and @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 is the cosmological scale factor , and @xmath27 is a small tensor perturbation representing a gw , that evolves according to@xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the anisotropic stress part of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath30 .",
    "it is defined through the relation @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the background pressure .",
    "the space part of the energy momentum tensor can be computed by means of : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the determinant of the metric , @xmath35 is the four - momentum ( @xmath36 is an affine parameter ) , and @xmath37 is the distribution function ( df ) of the particles in the fluid .",
    "the df evolves according to the boltzmann equation : @xmath38=\\hat c[f ] \\label{eq : boltz}\\ ] ] where the @xmath39 is the liouville operator , and @xmath40 is the collision operator accounting for collisions between particles .",
    "using the geodesic equation , the left - hand side ( lhs ) of the boltzmann equation ( the so called liouville operator @xmath41 ) for @xmath42 can be cast in the form ( summation over repeated indices is understood ) : @xmath38\\equiv\\frac{df}{d\\lambda}=p^0\\bigg[{\\frac{\\partial   f}{\\partial t}}+\\frac{p_i}{p^0}{\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i } }   + \\frac{p^j p^k}{2 p^0}{\\frac{\\partial g_{jk}}{\\partial x_i}}{\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_i}}\\bigg].\\ ] ] once the collision term is also specified , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tens evol ] ) , ( [ eq : en - mom tens ] ) and ( [ eq : boltz ] ) , together with the friedmann equation describing the background evolution , are all that is needed , at least in principle , to follow the propagation of a gw .      in this letter",
    "we shall consider gws that enter the hubble horizon well before neutrino decoupling ( occurring at @xmath43 ) , and we shall suppose that the main contribution to the anisotropic stress of matter is given by neutrinos .",
    "we can write the df of neutrinos as : @xmath44 so that at the initial time @xmath45 we have @xmath46 .",
    "we take for the df at the initial time the usual fermi - dirac form : contains itself a first - order part .",
    "however , @xmath47 is certainly first order since the zeroth - order part of the df ( [ eq : fermidirac ] ) satisfies the collisionless boltzmann equation over the flat , unperturbed robertson - walker metric . ]",

    "entering the horizon _",
    "after _ neutrino decoupling ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the situation we are going to deal with is complicated by the fact that the right - hand side ( rhs ) of the boltzmann equation does not vanish , neutrinos being yet interacting with the cosmological plasma .",

    "we note that since @xmath72 , we have @xmath73 .",
    "the dimensionless quantity @xmath68 gives an estimate of the average number of interactions occurring between @xmath45 and @xmath74 .      in order to proceed further ,",
    "we need to calculate the optical depth @xmath75 . in the following we shall consided gws entering the horizon before the ewpt ( @xmath76 ) . in order to better understand which region in frequency space we are investigating when we make this assumption ,",
    "it is useful to find the relation between the gravitational wave frequency and the temperature of the universe at the time when its horizon crossing occurs .",
    "this can be done very easily as follows .",
    "the temperature @xmath77 at which a wave , having today a physical wavelength equal to @xmath78 , entered the horizon is given by @xcite : @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 measure the contribution of relativistic species to the energy density and entropy density respectively . before ewpt ,",
    "all species in the standard models of fundamental interactions are relativistic , resulting in @xmath82 .",
    "furthermore , in thermal equilibrium @xmath83 . then we find that the present day frequency @xmath84 of the wave is : @xmath85 quite interestingly , we find that all cosmological gws that can be detected by laser interferometers , both spatial and ground - based , entered the horizon prior to the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "neutrinos are kept in thermal equilibrium with the cosmological plasma through the weak interactions with other particles . at energies large as the ones we are considering ,",
    "all the particles in the standard model of interactions are a possible target for neutrinos .",
    "the density @xmath71 that appears in the expression for @xmath68 is then @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the riemann zeta function of order 3 , and @xmath88 , in a similar way than @xmath80 and @xmath81 , measures the contributions of relativistic species to the particle number density . at @xmath89 , @xmath90",
    "this yields @xmath91 .    for what concerns the cross section",
    ", we have that in the regime corresponding to average thermal energies much larger than the rest masses of the @xmath92 weak bosons @xmath93 the temperature dependence of @xmath70 is roughly given by : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the fermi coupling constant .",
    "more detailed calculations can be performed to bring more precise formulas for the cross section . however , as we shall see in the following , the above expression us enough for our purposes .",
    "the last step in the computation of @xmath68 is to express the comoving wavenumber @xmath96 in terms of @xmath77 .",
    "considering the initial time @xmath45 to be very early , so that @xmath97 , we have that in the radiation dominated era @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath100 is the comoving horizon size , we have that @xmath101 corresponds to the time of horizon crossing .",
    "we choose to normalize the scale factor so that it is equal to unity at horizon crossing , then we take @xmath102 .",
    "now we just need to consider the physical wavelength @xmath36 as a function of temperature@xcite : @xmath103 evaluating this expression at @xmath77 and eliminating @xmath78 by means of eq .",
    "( [ eq : thc ] ) , we get for the comoving wavenumber @xmath96 : @xmath104 using this expression and eqs .",

    "( [ eq : tau ] ) .",
    "we use the short - hand notation that primed quantities are evaluated in @xmath113 , and unprimed ones are evaluated in @xmath57 .",
    "the above equation is an integro - differential equation for @xmath114 .",
    "it is supplied by the initial conditions @xcite : @xmath115 a numerical solution can be found by using standards method for integro - differential equations@xcite .",
    "it is however useful to consider two limiting cases . for waves entering the horizon very early ( i.e , @xmath116 , or equivalently @xmath117 ) ,",
    "the derivative of the optical depth is very small and then eq . ( [ eq : chi intdiff ] )",
    "recover the free streaming form found in ref .",
    "it is found in that paper that this results in an absorption of 35% of the wave squared amplitude . on the opposite , for waves having @xmath118 ,",
    "the derivative of the optical depth is very large .",
    "this makes the integration of the evolution equation not trivial , since the integral on the right hand side receives contribution only from a very small region where @xmath119 significantly differs from zero . technically speaking",
    ", the integral kernel is said be `` quasi singular''@xcite .",
    "however , we can exploit this characteristic to our advantage .",
    "in fact , when the following disequality holds : @xmath120 we can approximate @xmath121 with a dirac delta function @xmath122 . the above condition can be checked _",
    "a posteriori _ after obtaining a solution .",
    "however , apart from the mathematical details , it is clear that this approximation relies on the fact that the characteristic time scale for the variation of the gravitational field is much larger than the mean time between collisions .",
    "the integral source term on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi intdiff ] ) depends , in general , on the whole past history of the system .",
    "nevertheless , when the condition expressed in ( [ eq : tight condition ] ) holds , the very fast interaction rate destroys any information on the past history of the system , so that the integral is dominated by local ( in time ) contributions .",
    "this condition can , on the other hand , tested _ a priori _ using a test function in place of the actual solution @xmath123 .",
    "a reasonable guess is to suppose that the solution we are seeking does not differ too much from the vacuum solution @xmath124 , i.e. the solution in absence of anisotropic stress .",
    "the solution of eq.([eq : chi intdiff ] ) with vanishing rhs is @xmath125 .",
    "we use this as a test function . inside the horizon ( @xmath126 ) , where the source term is really effective and @xmath127 , so that the source term is very small . ]",
    ", we have that @xmath128 . the condition",
    "then simply reads @xmath129 .",
    "seen in another way , the expression of the vacuum solution in terms of its fourier components is : @xmath130 so that only harmonics with `` frequency '' @xmath131 give a contribution to this solution . the condition that the mean collision time is much smaller than the time scale for the gw evolution , reads then @xmath132 . comparing with eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) , we see that this is the case for all @xmath96 modes entering the horizon before the ewpt , up to modes entering as earlier as @xmath133 .",
    "thus , using the substitution : @xmath134 the evolution equation reads : @xmath135 where we have dropped a term proportional to @xmath136 .",
    "this ordinary differential equation , describing the evolution of a gravitational wave in a tightly coupled plasma , is , together with the more general equation ( [ eq : chi intdiff ] ) and the expression ( [ eq : an stress ] ) for the anisotropic stress , the main achievement of this letter .",
    "we note that , once the condition ( [ eq : tight condition ] ) is fulfilled , the gw evolution does not depend on the details of the interaction , since the optical depth , and consequently the interaction cross section , do not appear anymore .",
    "the only physical parameter related to the background conditions appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi diff ] ) , is the fraction of energy density contributed by neutrinos .",
    "moreover , using the @xmath57 time parameterization , the equation is universal in the sense that it does not depend on the wavenumber @xmath96 .",
    "a numerical solution to the above equation can be found quite easily .",
    "we plot this solution ( let us it call the `` matter solution '' ) for the standard value @xmath3 , together with @xmath137 , in the left panel of fig . [",
    "fig : chi+t ] .",
    "the solution follows quite closely the vacuum one .",
    "a closer inspection shows that , far after the horizon crossing , the squared amplitude of a wave propagating in the cosmological plasma gets damped .",
    "we use as a measure of the transmitted intensity the following quantity @xmath138 : @xmath139 where brackets denote time average over a period . in particular",
    ", we find that at @xmath140 , @xmath141 , so that the intensity is reduced by a factor @xmath142 with respect to the vacuum case .",
    "we expect the damping not to become too much larger than this value , since the source term is multiplied by a factor @xmath143 , and the gets rapidly suppressed after the entrance in the horizon .",
    "this is confirmed by examining the behaviour in time of @xmath138 , shown the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : chi+t ] .",
    "we see that it approaches asimptotically a constant value , let us denote it with @xmath144 , equal to @xmath145 .",
    "non - standard physics ( for example , the presence of a lepton asymmetry ) can result in a different value for @xmath1 and consequently for the transmitted intensity @xmath146 .",
    "integrating the equation for different values of @xmath1 in the range @xmath147 $ ] we find that , with a very good approximation , @xmath146 depends linearly on @xmath1 .",
    "a fitting formula is given by : @xmath148",
    "our analysis outlined how gravitational waves produced in the early universe are softly damped due to the anisotropic stress of cosmological background neutrinos .",
    "we have considered gravitational waves entering the horizon before the electroweak phase transition , corresponding to observable frequencies today @xmath149 .",
    "we find that the anisotropic stress is closely related to the optical depth @xmath68 of the cosmological plasma with respect to the propagation of neutrinos , and to its first derivative with respect to time . in the limit of very small time derivative of the optical depth , relevant for frequencies @xmath150 , the behaviour studied in ref .",
    "@xcite is recovered , resulting in an absorption of 35.6% of the wave intensity .",
    "this frequencies are however unaccessible to present - day interferometers . in the opposite limit of very large values of this",
    "derivative , relevant for observables frequencies @xmath151 , we find that roughly @xmath152 of the wave intensity is absorbed by the cosmological plasma , independently from its wavelength .",
    "this result does not depend on the details of the weak interactions between particles in the plasma , but depends only on the amount of neutrinos present in the universe , as parameterised by the quantity @xmath1 .",
    "the importance of our results relies in the fact that the damping affects gws in the frequency range where the lisa space interferometer and future , second generation ground - based interferometers can possibly detect a signal of cosmological origin .",
    "this effect is roughly of the same order of magnitude as the one affecting gws detectable through the b - modes of cmb polarization .",
    "the damping is not so severe to make the detection of cosmological waves unfeasible by interferometers .",
    "however it should be taken into account when testing the theoretical predictions of early universe scenarios against observations .",
    "moreover , the dependence of @xmath153 on @xmath1 can be exploited to measure the latter , and to constrain models of non - standard physics .",
    "this even more important in view of the fact that in this way we could measure the value of @xmath1 at very early times , while available constraints regard the neutrino fraction at the time of cosmological nucleosynthesis or at the time of matter - radiation decoupling ."
