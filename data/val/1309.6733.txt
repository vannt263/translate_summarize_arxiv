    "the extrasolar planetary system wasp-3 comprises a transiting planet with a mass of @xmath0 times the mass of jupiter ( @xmath1 ) , which orbits a main - sequence star of spectral type f7 - 8 and apparent magnitude @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the orbital period is only @xmath3  d , making wasp-3  b one of the hottest planets known at the time of its discovery . the planetary radius , which is known to be 1.3 times larger than the radius of jupiter ( @xmath4 ) , is consistent with atmospheric models for strongly - irradiated giant planets .",
    "the system properties have been determined through several photometric and spectroscopic follow - up studies .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite acquired high - precision transit light curves and redetermined the stellar and planetary radii , orbital inclination , and transit ephemeris .",

    "@xcite found that the measured mid - transit times seemed to be statistically inconsistent with strict periodicity , i.e. , fitting the measured times to a linear function of epoch gave an unacceptably large @xmath5 .",
    "they noted that this could be explained as a consequence of either variations in the planetary orbit due to an unseen companion , or underestimated uncertainties in the measured mid - transit times .",
    "@xcite measured six mid - transit times from light curves acquired with 0.6-m class telescopes , combined them with data from the literature , and concluded that the transit times may be modulated with a period of @xmath6127 days and a peak - to - peak amplitude of @xmath64 minutes .",
    "numerical simulations showed that such a pattern of transit timing variation ( ttv ) could be produced by an additional low - mass planet .",
    "the postulated ttv signal has not been confirmed by further observations @xcite , and analyses of the mid - transit times now exclude the originally - postulated periodic ttv signal @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite showed that the measured mid - transit times are still not statistically consistent with a linear ephemeris , and pointed out that such apparently chaotic timing variations could be produced by some specific orbital configurations .",
    "@xcite suggested that chromospheric activity of the parent star could be a potential source of the transit timing noise .    in this paper we present results of new photometric and spectroscopic follow - up observations ,",
    "the goal of which was to confirm or refute the hypothesis about the second planet in the wasp-3 system .",
    "as our newly measured mid - transit times are consistent with a linear ephemeris , and no signal in rv residuals from a single planet orbital fit is detected , we determine upper limits on the mass of a hypothetical second planet as a function of its orbital period .",
    "in addition , we redetermined the stellar and planetary properties of the wasp-3 system using our spectroscopic and photometric data sets .",

    "these indices show the @xmath31 variation at a level of 0.22% and 0.21% for the h@xmath58 and index , respectively .",
    "this intrinsic scatter is much smaller than the @xmath31 scatter for the stellar @xmath72 ( 2.39% ) and @xmath73 ( 0.58% ) .",
    "these findings show that presence of the weak i@xmath34 lines in the combined stellar - iodine spectra do not introduce significant errors into determinations of the activity indices .    as most of our het /",

    "a linear regression gives a gradient of @xmath74  d@xmath35 .",
    "moreover , measurements in 2010 exhibit larger scatter , compared to the less active stage in 2011 . this effect could be caused by slowly - evolving active regions on the stellar surface , which are modulated by stellar rotation .",

    "it has been shown that this approach provides the most reliable parameters and error estimates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the tap code employs the quadratic limb - darkening ( ld ) law . as the initial values for the fitting procedure , we used theoretical values of ld coefficients ( ldcs ) from tables of @xcite , linearly interpolated with the exofast applet @xcite for the wasp-3 stellar parameters that were presented in sect .",

    "it has been shown that monte carlo , bootstrapping , or residual - shift ( prayer - bead ) methods may lead to underestimated uncertainties by a factor of up to four ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the wavelet - based techniques that are implemented in tap allow one to take into account time - correlated noise in the photometric data , and seem to provide the most reliable uncertainty estimates @xcite .",
    "transit timing may also be affected by systematic effects caused by weather conditions ( e.g. passing thin clouds , variable atmospheric extinction ) , instrumental factors ( e.g. imperfect autoguiding , variable characteristic of the ccd matrix ) , or data reduction ( e.g. detrending and normalization of a light curve ) .",
    "these effects are difficult to account for in the error budget , and may generate outliers in the o  c diagram .",
    "if the sample of transit times is limited to these reported in this paper and two points reported by @xcite ( taken for a longer timespan ) , the reduced @xmath5 for a linear ephemeris is equal to 1.07 .",
    "this result shows that our transit times are consistent with the linear ephemeris .",
    "we also examined those light curves which are the sources of mid - transit times lying more than 1  @xmath36 away from zero in the o ",
    "c diagram ( note that no point deviates by more than 3 @xmath36 ) .",
    "most of these light curves have incomplete coverage of a transit or were obtained on nights with variable conditions ( thin clouds , deteriorating transparency , or a high airmass range ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that the large scatter in the o  c diagram is likely a consequence of underestimated uncertainties due to observational and/or data - analysis factors .",
    "the systemic console software @xcite was used to refine the orbital parameters of wasp-3  b. the data from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite were combined with our new rv measurements to derive the planet s minimum planetary mass @xmath98 and semi - major axis @xmath99 .",

    "the mid - transit times after 3-@xmath36 clipping were included in the rv model to better constrain the mean anomaly at an initial epoch .",
    "the orbital period was allowed to be a free parameter , in order to verify the value obtained from transit timing alone , and to take into account the uncertainty in the orbital period when computing the uncertainties in the other parameters . for this analysis we adopted the value of @xmath42 with uncertainties obtained in sect .",

    "the scale parameters were set empirically in a series of attempts to get the acceptance rate of the mcmc procedure close to the optimal value of @xmath101 . for each parameter",
    ", the standard deviation was taken as the final error estimate .",
    "two scenarios with a circular and eccentric orbits were considered . in the latter case ,",
    "the eccentricity was found to be @xmath102 with reduced @xmath5 equal to 1.18 and @xmath103 equal to 26.7  m  s@xmath35 .",

    "our rv dataset and that of @xcite contain measurements spanning two consecutive observing seasons . splitting these datasets into individual seasons and keeping relative offsets as free parameters could reveal possible long - term rv shifts caused by instrumental effects , small - number statistics , stellar activity , or additional bodies on wide orbits .",
    "this approach results in the value of @xmath103 reduced by 10% .",
    "however , the relative offsets were found to be @xmath107 and @xmath108 m  s@xmath35 for the dataset of @xcite and our new measurements , respectively .",
    "both values are consistent with zero within @xmath6@xmath109 .",
    "therefore there is no compelling evidence for any rv trends over the timespan of 1 year .",

    "the mass of the fictitious planet was set at 0.5 , 1 , 5 , 10 , 50 , 100 , and 500 @xmath110 ( earth masses ) , and the initial orbital distance varied between 0.006 and 0.2 au with a step of @xmath111 au .",
    "the initial orbital longitude of wasp-3  b was set at a value calculated for cycle zero , and the initial longitude of the fictitious planet was shifted by @xmath112 .",

    "the value of @xmath31 was calculated for each synthetic o  c diagram .",
    "then , for each value of the orbital distance , we determined the range of planet masses for which the calculated @xmath113 was smaller than 80  s. before calculating @xmath113 , a 3-@xmath36 clipping was applied to remove `` outlying '' data points .",
    "an upper mass of the fictitious planet at the detection limit was found by linear interpolation for masses below 500 @xmath110 .",
    "if @xmath113 was found to be generated by a more massive body , the limiting mass was extrapolated using a linear trend as fitted to 100 and 500 @xmath110 .",
    "most of orbits located within @xmath63.5 hill radii of wasp-3  b ( i.e. , close to 1:1 orbital period commensurability ) were found to be highly unstable and planetary close encounters or planet ejections occurred during the relatively short time of integration .",
    "a similar approach was applied to the rv dataset .",
    "the value of @xmath103 ( sect .  [ sect.rv ] ) was used to calculate the mass limit as a function of the semi - major axis of the fictitious planet . again , circular orbits were assumed .",

    "we have acquired 32 new transit light curves for the planet wasp-3  b , and 17 precise radial velocity measurements for the wasp-3 host star .",
    "our new data cover a timespan of 2 years from 2009 to 2011 .",
    "the tangible result of our study is refining stellar , orbital , and planetary parameters with improved precision .",
    "our studies of the stellar activity of wasp-3 confirm its long timescale variation reported by @xcite and also reveal a night - to - night variability when the star was in a more active state .",
    "these short timescale variations are likely to be caused by active regions that are carried around by stellar rotation .    our result for the planetary mass ( @xmath114  @xmath1 ) agrees with the value reported by @xcite , and the radius ( @xmath115  @xmath4 ) falls between estimates of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "additional rv measurements provide tighter constraints on the orbital eccentricity ( @xmath102 ) than @xcite .",
    "the orbit of wasp-3  b is expected to be circular because its circularization timescale of 1 - 14 myr for the tidal dissipation parameter @xmath116 between @xmath94 and @xmath84 is much shorter than the system s age of @xmath56 gyr .    despite all of this observational effort , no evidence for the presence of the additional planet in the wasp-3 system was found . published hints for both periodic and chaotic variations in transit timing are likely caused by underestimated uncertainties and systematic effects affecting photometric measurements .",
    "we find a spectroscopic sign of variation in stellar activity for wasp-3 that is reported by @xcite .",
    "however , our high - precision photometry shows no evidence for starspot - crossing anomalies or other effects that stellar activity might have on transit light curves .",
    "the current precision of transit timing observations allows us to rule out earth - mass planetary companions of wasp-3  b near the lowest - order mean - motion resonances .",
    "the radial - velocity data show no sign of additional bodies , and in particular no long - term trend over a few years .",
    "we note , however , that the portion of parameter space for additional bodies that remains unexplored is still significant .",
    "analysis of a sample of hot jupiter candidates observed with the _ kepler _ space telescope @xcite shows that the overwhelming majority of these planets are devoid of close planetary companions @xcite .",
    "this effect is interpreted as a result of the dynamical evolution of planetary systems containing close - in giant planets . in this context , a lack of confirmation of ttvs for wasp-3  b is consistent with expectations arising from the _ kepler _ survey .",
