    "since before the discovery of the first transiting extrasolar planet @xcite , it has been recognized that transits provide a sensitive way to infer the existence of small bodies orbiting other stars @xcite .",
    "there are now dozens of ground - based photometric searches underway that aim to detect planets of distant stars by means of their photometric signatures @xcite , as well as several space projects with the same purpose @xcite .    until now ,",
    "the only confirmed planet detections by transits @xcite have been based on the ogle survey @xcite , which is performed with a telescope of 1.3 m aperture .",
    "the strategy of using a moderate - aperture telescope with seeing - limited spatial resolution must be commended for its obvious successes , and moreover because the 3 ogle planets are peculiar , having the shortest orbital periods yet known . but surveys using large telescopes suffer from the faintness of the stars with which they deal ( the @xmath5 magnitudes of the ogle planet host stars range from 14.4 to 15.7 ) . for such faint stars , the necessary follow - up",
    "observations are difficult and time - consuming , and the precision with which planetary parameters such as mass and radius can be determined is compromised .    for these reasons ,",
    "we have pursued a transiting planet search organized along different lines ",
    "one that uses small - aperture , wide - field telescopes to search for transits among brighter stars .",
    "the principal challenges facing wide - field surveys such as ours are to attain adequate photometric precision in the face of spatially varying atmospheric extinction and instrumental effects . and , as in all planet - search surveys",
    ", we must implement efficient methods for rejecting the many false alarms that appear in the photometric light curves .",
    "these false alarms result almost entirely from eclipsing systems involving 2 or more stars , including grazing eclipsing binaries , small stars transiting large ones , and eclipsing binaries diluted by the light of a third star . for bright - star searches",
    ", these imposters can outnumber true planetary transits by an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "because of the diverse nature of the false alarm sources , several kinds of follow - up observations are needed to reject them all @xcite .",
    "we report here the first transiting extrasolar planet to be detected by such a wide - field , bright - star survey .",
    "we also describe the confirmation process in some detail , as an illustration of the necessary steps in verifying that transits are caused by an object of planetary and not stellar mass .",
    "our initial photometric observations leading to the detection of a planetary transit signature were conducted using the 3 telescopes of the trans - atlantic exoplanet survey ( tres ) network .",
    "these telescopes ( stare , located on tenerife in the canary islands , psst , located at lowell observatory , arizona , and sleuth , located at mt .",
    "palomar , california)ftod / sleuth.html ] are being described individually elsewhere @xcite .",
    "briefly , all 3 are small - aperture ( 10 cm ) , wide - field ( 6@xmath6 ) , ccd - based systems with spatial resolution of about 11@xmath7 per pixel .",
    "they usually observe in red light ( roughly johnson @xmath8 for stare and psst , sloan @xmath9 for sleuth ) , and they operate in coordination , observing the same field in the sky continuously ( or as nearly as possible ) for typically 2-month intervals .",
    "the observing cadence at each site is roughly one image every 2 minutes , and the resulting time series are later binned to 9-minute time resolution .",
    "recent adoption of an image - subtraction algorithm ( based on @xcite ) yields photometric precision of better than 2 mmag for the brightest non - saturating stars ( @xmath10 ) , and better than 10 mmag for @xmath11 .",
    "we designate the planet described herein as tres-1 , the first confirmed planet detected using the tres network ; we refer to the parent star by the same name , since the distinction between planet and star will be clear from context .",
    "the star s coordinates , observed characteristics , and index numbers from various full - sky catalogs are given in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath13 values come from differential photometry relative to 32 stars with @xmath14 and @xmath12 data in simbad ; @xmath15 was obtained from observations of landolt s standards @xcite , and the @xmath16 values are from the 2mass catalog .",
    "the field containing this star was observed by 2 sites ( stare and psst ) during the summer of 2003 , with stare obtaining 49 good nights of observations and psst 25 .",
    "the sleuth telescope was still under development at that time , and so did not observe this field .",
    "the top panel of figure 1 shows the near - transit portion of the light curve of tres-1 , folded with a period of 3.030065 days . this curve is a superposition of 4 full transits and 2 partial ones , all observed with the stare telescope .",
    "even though the psst telescope obtained 25 nights of good observations on the field , it observed no transits of tres-1 in 2003 .",
    "this circumstance arose because the orbital period is very nearly an integral number of days , so that for long intervals , transits can be observed only from certain longitudes on the earth .",
    "although data from psst played no role in detecting the transits , its data proved essential for a correct determination of the orbital period : we rejected several candidate periods because they implied transit events that were not seen from the western us .",
    "tres-1 is thus a graphic demonstration of the utility of a longitude - distributed network of transit - detection telescopes .",
    "the @xmath8-band transit seen by tres has a flat - bottomed shape , a depth of 0.023 mag , and a total duration of about 3 hr .",
    "these characteristics are consistent with expectations for a jupiter - sized planet crossing a cool dwarf star , but both experience @xcite and theory @xcite show that they are more likely to result from an eclipsing stellar system .",
    "multiple star systems , in which the eclipsing binary component contributes only a small fraction of the total light , are particularly insidious .",
    "thus , tres-1 was one of 16 stars that displayed transit - like events among the 12000 stars we monitored in its surrounding field .",
    "we therefore began an extensive program of observations with larger telescopes , to determine whether the eclipses actually result from a body of planetary mass .    from table 1",
    ", the @xmath17 color of 0.48 suggests a star with spectral type of late g or early k. digitized sky survey images show no bright neighbors within the 20@xmath7 radius of a stare stellar image , and adaptive - optics @xmath18- and @xmath19-band imaging with the william herschel telescope showed no companion within 2 mag in brightness , farther than 0.3@xmath7 from the primary star . with its observed @xmath12 magnitude of 11.79 , and ignoring interstellar extinction , the implied distance to tres-1 is about 150 pc .",
    "combining this distance with the usno - b1.0 proper motion of 47 mas y@xmath20 @xcite gives a transverse velocity of 26 km s@xmath20 , which is fairly typical for low - mass field stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "thus , the photometric and astrometric evidence tends to confirm that most of the detected light comes from a nearby dwarf star .",
    "we observed the star using the cfa digital speedometers @xcite at 7 different epochs , giving coverage of the full orbital phase .",
    "these instruments record 4.5 nm of spectrum centered on the mg b lines , with spectral resolution of about 8.5  km  s@xmath20 .",
    "for the 7 exposures spanning 60 days we determined a mean velocity of @xmath2120.52 km  s@xmath20 . the average internal error estimate and actual velocity rms achieved were both 0.39 km s@xmath20 , suggesting that any companion orbiting with a 3.03-day period must have a mass smaller than 5 @xmath22 .",
    "this conclusion is not firm , however , if there is blending light from a third component . from comparisons of our observed spectra with synthetic spectra calculated by j. morse using kurucz models ( morse & kurucz , private communication ) , we estimate that tres-1 has @xmath23 k , @xmath24 , @xmath25 km s@xmath20 , and metallicity similar to that of the sun .",
    "the slow rotation is particularly significant , for several reasons : it indicates that the star has not been spun up by tidal interactions with a massive secondary , it forecloses some blending scenarios , and it means that more precise radial velocity measurements can be obtained fairly readily .",
    "we also obtained a moderate resolution echelle spectrum covering the entire visible wavelength range , using the palomar 1.5 m telescope . based on the comparison of this spectrum with the spectral standards of @xcite",
    ", we classify the star as k0v ; it shows no sign of a composite spectrum nor of other peculiarities .",
    "many multiple - star configurations involve components with different colors , which cause the blended eclipses to have color - dependent depths .",
    "moreover , the detailed shape of eclipse light curves provides two independent estimates of the secondary s size , relative to that of the primary star .",
    "one of these estimates comes from the eclipse depth , and the other from the duration of the eclipse s ingress and egress portions @xcite .",
    "consistency between these estimates is an indication that blending with light from a third star is not important .",
    "we therefore obtained multicolor photometric observations of several transits , using larger telescopes and a variety of filters . at the iac 80-cm telescope",
    ", we observed a partial transit ( missing the egress ) with johnson @xmath12 and @xmath5 filters ; at the university of colorado sommers - bausch observatory 61-cm telescope , we observed a full transit with johnson @xmath14 and @xmath8 filters ; at the cfa s fred l. whipple observatory 1.2-m telescope , we observed one full and one partial transit with sloan @xmath26 , @xmath9 , and @xmath27 filters .",
    "the psst telescope also observed 4 transits in @xmath8 during the 2004 season .",
    "-4pt figure 1 displays all of these observations , along with a fit to a model , which we shall discuss below .",
    "the light curves show no evidence for color dependence of the transit depth ( beyond that expected from color - dependent stellar limb darkening ) , and both the transit depth and the short ingress / egress times are consistent with transits by an object whose radius is a small fraction ( less than about 0.15 ) of the primary star s radius .",
    "detailed modeling of the light curves following @xcite was carried out in an attempt to explain the observations as the result of blending with an eclipsing binary .",
    "we found all plausible fits to be inconsistent with constraints from the cfa spectroscopy . we conclude that tres-1 is not significantly blended with the light of another star .    on",
    "the strength of the foregoing analysis we obtained precise radial velocity measurements using the i@xmath28 absorption cell and hires spectrograph on the keck i telescope .",
    "eight observations were collected over a period of 18 days in july 2004 , providing good coverage of critical phases .",
    "the data reduction involved modeling of the temporal and spatial variations of the instrumental profile of the spectrograph @xcite , and is conceptually similar to that described by @xcite .",
    "internal errors were computed from the scatter of the velocities from the echelle orders containing i@xmath28 lines , and are typically 10 - 15 m s@xmath20 .",
    "figure 2 shows the radial velocity measurements , along with a fit to a sinusoidal variation that is constrained to have the period and phase determined from the photometric data .",
    "this constrained fit matches the data well , and yields a velocity semi - amplitude of @xmath29 m s@xmath20 .",
    "the rms residual of the fit is 14 m s@xmath20 , in good agreement with the average of the internal errors .",
    "examination of the spectral line profiles in our keck spectra by means of the bisector spans @xcite indicated no significant asymmetries and no correlation with orbital phase , once again ruling out a blend .",
    "for purposes of an initial estimate of the planetary mass and radius , we assumed tres-1 to have @xmath30k and solar metallicity . by comparing with the accurately - known mass and radius of @xmath31 cen b , which has a similar @xmath32 but probably higher metallicity @xcite , and correcting for the assumed metallicity difference of @xmath33}=-0.2 $ ] using evolutionary models by @xcite",
    ", we estimate a stellar mass @xmath34 and a radius @xmath35 .",
    "we took limb darkening relations from @xcite and from claret ( private communication ) , for models with solar metallicity , @xmath36 , and @xmath30 k. we assign ( somewhat arbitrarily ) an uncertainty of @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "we also take @xmath39 , since adequate fits to the photometry can not be obtained for stellar radii outside this range .    using the approximate orbital period and the constraints and assumptions just described",
    ", we estimated the orbital semimajor axis @xmath40 and planetary mass @xmath41 from the observed stellar reflex velocity and kepler s laws .",
    "we then performed a minimum-@xmath42 fit to all of the photometry ( with errors estimated from the internal scatter of the input data , taken when possible from the out - of - transit data only ) , to obtain estimates for the planetary radius @xmath43 and orbital inclination @xmath44 , and refined estimates for the epoch of transit center @xmath45 and for the orbital period @xmath46 .",
    "our best estimates of the planet s orbital and physical parameters are given in table 2 , and the solid curves in figs 1 and 2 show the fitted photometric and radial velocity variations overplotted on the data .    the error estimates given in table 2 include errors that follow from our uncertainty in the radius and mass of the parent star ( which is assumed to be a main - sequence object ) , as indicated in table 1 .",
    "these uncertainties ( especially in @xmath47 ) dominate errors in the photometry as regards estimates of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "if the stellar radius and mass were known accurately , the uncertainties in @xmath43 and in @xmath44 would be smaller by about a factor of 10 .",
    "contrariwise , if the star is actually a subgiant ( photometric constraints notwithstanding ) , @xmath43 could exceed the upper limit in table 2 .",
    "the error in @xmath41 arises about equally from the radial velocity measurement precision and from our uncertainty in @xmath38 .",
    "the mass , orbital radius , and radiative equilibrium temperature of tres-1 are quite similar to those of hd 209458b , yet the former planet s radius is about 20% smaller . indeed ,",
    "as shown in figure 3 , the radius of tres-1 is more similar to those of the ogle planets , and it closely matches current models for irradiated planets without internal energy sources @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy between the radii of hd 209458b and tres-1 reinforces suspicion that hd 209458b has an anomalously large radius .",
    "the confrontation between theory and observation for this object would be facilitated if the stellar radius and ( to a lesser degree ) mass could be better constrained .",
    "we are undertaking a careful study of the keck spectra of tres-1 , and we will report improved estimates of the stellar parameters derived from them in a later paper . in the long run , however , a better approach is to obtain improved observations . with spaceborne photometry , one can achieve low enough noise to fit for both the planetary and the stellar radius @xcite .",
    "though one still requires a guess for @xmath38 , the derived planetary properties are much less sensitive to this parameter than they are to @xmath47 .",
    "similarly , an accurate parallax measurement would imply a useful constraint on @xmath47 .",
    "thus , tres-1 may be an attractive target for either ground- or space - based interferometric astrometry , since it is relatively bright ( @xmath48 ) , and it has several neighbors of similar brightness within a radius of a few arcminutes .",
