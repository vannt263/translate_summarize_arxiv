    "the existence of chiral molecules is one of the fundamental broken symmetries in nature .",
    "chiral molecules can be modelled as being in a mirror - symmetric double - well potential @xcite : left - handed states are in the left well and right - handed ones in the right . strictly speaking , left-/right- handed states in the left / right wells are not the eigenstates of double - well potential due to the tunnelling between the left and right wells . but the tunnelling rates are usually very small , so left-/right handed states can be considered as stable eigenstates of chiral - molecule systems .",
    "chiral purification and discrimination @xcite of a mixture of chiral molecules are among the most important and difficult tasks in chemistry .",
    "the usual purification methods for chiral molecules are based on asymmetric synthesis , e.g. , gas or liquid chromatographic methods @xcite .",

    "the left - handed cyclic system behaves like the right - handed one except the intrinsically - different total phases of the three rabi frequencies if three transitions are coupled to three optical fields , respectively .",
    "the idea was to optically transfer chiral molecules which are in their initial respective ground states to final levels at different energies .",

    "interestingly , we can distinguish mixed left- and right - handed molecules ( in their respective ground states ) by dynamically driving them to different - energy final states .",
    "the general cyclic three - level system coupled with three classical optical fields respectively can be described by the hamiltonian @xcite in the rotating - wave approximation ( @xmath9 ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the energies of the states @xmath12 , @xmath13 are the frequencies of the optical fields coupling to the transition @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are the rabi frequencies which can be controlled by varying the field strength @xmath16 ; @xmath17 is the dipole matrix element between the states @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",

    "we will specify our model by choosing the coupling strengths ( that is , rabi frequencies ) of the left-/right- handed molecules as @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , @xmath28,@xmath29 ( see fig .",

    "the left - handed molecular state @xmath67 remains unchanged : @xmath68 on the other hand , the @xmath65 rotation pulse acting on the right - handed molecules will transfer the state @xmath69 to the final state @xmath70 here , the corresponding hamiltonians for the chiral molecules are again given by eqs .",
    "( [ hamil - left1],[hamil - right1 ] ) , respectively .     and @xmath71 rotation pulses of three optical coupling strengths ( rabi frequencies ) . here",
    ", the notation @xmath72 is used to indicate a @xmath7 rotation pulse for the effective rabi frequency @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) , and _ not _ for the rabi frequencies @xmath75 and @xmath45 . , width=7,height=4 ]    the above protocol , which includes several simple ultrashort rotations , will bring the initial state @xmath76 for the left - handed molecules and @xmath77 for the right - handed ones .",

    "( ii ) the internal degree of freedom of a three - level system is reduced to the lower two ( pseudo - spin ) states in @xcite by assuming a large detuning . here",
    ", we discuss the molecular dynamics in the space of three levels with all the optical coupling resonant to the corresponding transition .",
    "( iii ) different chiral molecules can be separated spatially ; here , we only focus on how to distinguish different chiral molecules according to the different final states as in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the present protocol is also different from the methods described in refs .",
    "@xcite , where molecules with different chirality are distinguished by adiabatical processes via controlling three overlapping optical fields .",
    "the dynamical rotation method proposed here provides another possibility to distinguish mixed chiral molecules by using several simple optical ultrashort pulses .",
    "in contrast to the scheme described in ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume the molecules to be pre - oriented ( similar to refs .",
    "@xcite ) in order to ensure that the rabi frequencies are identical for all the molecules in the mixture ( up to a phase factor ) when coupling to a same optical field .    in the present separation scheme as well as similar ones @xcite , the molecular temperature",
    "is assumed to be low enough such that the molecules are prepared in the ground state initially .",
    "we neglect finite - temperature effects and molecular interactions .    in the protocol described above , all three kinds of optical fields couple resonantly to the molecular transitions .",
    "that means the optical fields satisfy the energy conservation condition @xmath84 .",
    "this resembles sum - frequency generation in nonlinear media @xcite , which requires energy conservation as well as momentum conservation ( along a certain direction ) .",
    "sum - frequency generation is one of the techniques used to probe ( but not separate ) molecular chirality @xcite .",
    "the separation protocol described in our paper is not related to sum - frequency generation and is not constrained by the momentum conservation of optical wave - vectors ( that is why the three optical fields can be coplanar or not ) .",
    "recently , many studies about preparing , measuring and teleporting superpositions of chiral states @xcite have appeared in the literature . in these works ,",
    "superposition states are obtained by involving a symmetric or antisymmetric higher excited state which can couple to the left - handed or right - handed states by optical fields . in this paper",
    ", we aim to separate mixtures of left - handed and right - handed chiral molecules .",
    "so the external excited state is not introduced , and superpositions of chiral states are not considered here .",
    "decoherence processes are the biggest obstacle for any quantum state transfer operation . due to",
    "the fact that our protocol only uses dynamic ultrashort - pulse operations and does not require adiabaticity assumptions , our method will work faster and make decoherence effects less important .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a protocol to separate left- and right - handed molecules .",
    "this protocol , which consists of several simple dynamical rotation operations of optical pulses , can be implemented on a short time scale compared with the decoherence time due to spontaneous emission .",
    "we would like to remark that all three kinds of optical couplings have to be used ( though not at the same time ) during the rotation operations in this separation protocol .",
    "physically , this is because the two kinds of chiral molecules can be distinguished only by the total phase of the three rabi frequencies ( which differ by @xmath7 ) .",
    "if only two kinds of optical couplings are used , the molecular system will reduce to the @xmath85- , @xmath86- or ladder - type three - level system , which can not be used to distinguish different chiralities .",
