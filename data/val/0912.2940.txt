    "the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) project has been steadily monitoring millions of stars in the magellanic clouds for the past 12 years .",
    "the 1.3 m warsaw telescope at las campanas observatory , chile , takes photometric images in the i band , which now make up a decade long database that includes most of the hmxb systems in the smc ( see @xcite and @xcite for more details on the instrument and catalogue ) . the bottom panel in fig .",

    "the macho data have been arbitrarily normalised for viewing purposes .",
    "it is clear that the long period oscillations described in @xcite are also present in the ogle data , indicating a quasi - periodic brightening that is intrinsic to the be star ; most likely the growth and decay of the circumstellar disk .",
    "although the ogle iii light curve does not extend up to the most recent _ rxte _ detection ( this particular source falls on an ogle chip - gap , thereby needing a different reduction process to the normal pipeline ) , it is apparent that the most luminous x - ray outbursts seem to coincide with the epochs of maximum optical brightness .",

    "changes in the ( b - r ) colour support this idea . by comparison with the x - ray light curve",
    "we find that at least two of the x - ray outbursts are consistent with optical maximum .",
    "this has also been observed in other such systems ( see fig.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray light curve shows no periodic behaviour that can be attributed to a binary period .",
    "all the detected outbursts seem to be driven by the intrinsic behavior of the be star .",
    "we note that only small fluctuations in the pulse period are observed and that these show no correlation with time . of greater interest",
    "is the pulse period history of the most recent type ii outburst ( mjd 54688 - mjd 54830 ) , which shows no general spin - up trend .",
    "this is an unusual observation as most hmxb systems show spin up of the neutron star during type ii outbursts due to the high accretion torques present .    although we were unable to gain any quantitative handle of how the pulsed emission changed during the outburst ,",
    "the pulse profiles show very complex double and triple peaked structure ( see fig . [",
    "fig : test ] ) .",
    "this tells us much about the geometry of the system and of the beam emission regions : we see both poles from the pulsar , with the emission from the poles asymmetrical and , except for the profiles corresponding to mjd = 54725 and 54744 in fig .",
    "[ fig : test ] , always favouring one pole .",
    "this implies accretion onto the poles is asymmetric .",
    "the variability in the shape and width of the most prominent peak suggests we are seeing both fan and pencil beam emission .",
    "however , it has been observed that pulse profiles are very messy at low energies , with the possibility that the absorption is varying with neutron star spin phase , so it is difficult to confirm that we are indeed seeing both fan and pencil beams in these energy ranges .",
    "@xcite theorise that pencil beams should be dominant under low accretion rates ( hence low luminosities ) and that fan beams should dominate at high accretion rates , as the radiation is strongly absorbed by the infalling material and can largely only be emitted sideways . however , from the profiles presented here there seems to be no clear dependence of the profile shape on flux .",
    "the pulsed fraction calculated from the folded light curves is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse_frac ] . the formula used in these calculations",
    "is given in eqn .",
    "[ equ : pf ] .",
    "we show that there is considerable variation in the measured pulsed fraction throughout the outburst , with the source appearing to increase and then return to some base level .",
    "@xmath19    we note that the pulsed fraction is only correct if sxp6.85 was the only source detected in that observation . if other sources were detected , then the base emission includes emission from those objects and as such the pulsed fraction is only the lower limit of the actual value .",
    "we find a marginal correlation between source intensity and pulsed fraction , which could be attributed to the fractional change in the contribution of quiescent sources in the field .",
    "transient sources have been previously detected at low luminosities while in quiescence ( i.e. without any pulsed emission ) .",
    "therefore , although we can be sure there was no bright pulsed emission from any source in the field of view , we can not be certain that there was no continuous emission .",
    "the values presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse_frac ] are a factor of three lower than the value presented in @xcite , having taken the method of calculating the pulsed fraction into account .",
    "this implies either a significant contribution from background sources to the _ rxte _ spectrum or that there has been a dramatic change of pulsed emission between the two observations .",
    "those authors also find that sxp6.85 has one of the hardest spectra of known hmxb systems with a photon index of @xmath40.4 .",
    "this also suggests that there is contamination from other sources in the _ rxte _ spectrum , softening the powerlaw photon index to the value of 0.8 found in this study .",
    "it has been observed in other be / x - ray binary systems that the ( j - k ) colour often remains constant for long periods of time despite dramatic changes in near - ir magnitude ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "sxp6.85 also exhibits this behavior as can be seen in table [ ta : irsf ] .",
    "the brightness of the system has increased by almost one third of a magnitude in the year between the two irsf observations .",
    "however , the ( j - k ) colour has remained unchanged at 0.17 .",
    "this is indicative of the temperature of the circumstellar disk remaining constant , whilst the increased brightness indicates the surface area of the disk has increased .",
    "it is possible to make a rough guess at the size of the circumstellar disk using the h@xmath0 w@xmath20 measurements and making some assumptions on inclination and optical depth . using the models of @xcite",
    ", we estimate the disk half - width at half - maximum ( hwhm ) radius to be approximately 3r@xmath21 on 2008 december 16 and approximately 2.7r@xmath21 on 2007 september 17 , an increase of over 11 percent in the year leading up to the recent type ii outburst . in this calculation",
    "we do not take into account any truncation caused by the neutron star and we make some approximations regarding the binary system : the effective temperature of the star is 30000k , the inclination is 10@xmath8 , the optically thin outer boundary of the disk is at 50r@xmath21 and the disk continuum dilution factor is 0.0033 @xcite .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for more detail on the model input parameters .",
    "the key thing to note is that varying the disk outer boundary by factors of 2 - 3 changes the calculated hwhm radius by approximately 10 percent as the model assumes a small contribution to the h@xmath0 flux from the optically thin part of the disk .",
    "thus , the relative growth of the disk is set by the model despite the uncertainty in the actual radius .",
    "we also note that the 2008 measurement was made after sxp6.85 had been in outburst for more than 16 weeks , and as such the disk may have been significantly larger at the start of the outburst than the value estimated here .",
    "if we consider the ir magnitudes taken in december 2007 and december 2008 , this yields a fractional increase in brightness of 1.33 ; a factor of three higher than the prediction made using the equivalent widths .",
    "the ogle light curve shows variations on the order of 0.7 magnitudes over the entire epoch of coverage , corresponding to a factor of 1.9 in brightness ( here we assume that the change in flux is proportional to the change in surface area of the disk , which is reasonable for an optically thick disk ) .",
    "if we assume that the recent x - ray activity occured during an optical maximum and that the disk hwhm at this time was @xmath43r@xmath21 , this implies the minimum , or quiescent , level of the disk is at @xmath41.5r@xmath21 .",
    "clearly these are rough estimates based on some simplistic approximations .",
    "more detailed modelling is encouraged to reveal a more accurate description of the circumstellar disk in this system .",
    "w@xmath20 measurements of sxp6.85 taken at the saao 1.9-m telescope during december 2008 .",
    "the large error bars associated with the first three values are due to a lower snr from shorter observations .",
    "the horizontal dashed line represents the h@xmath0 w@xmath20 of the source during the september 2007 observation .",
    "the associated error in this case is much lower due to the higher snr that can be obtained at the eso 3.6-m telescope.[fig : eqw],width=226 ]    , width=226 ]",
    "the x - ray and optical data presented here are evidence that sxp6.85 is indeed a be / x - ray binary system .",
    "the x - ray light curve shows the transient nature of the source , whilst the optical and near - ir data suggest there are quasi - periodic modulations that are intrinsic to the be star that are likely to be associated with the extended envelope of matter in the equatorial plane of the companion .",
    "flux measurements show that an extended disk is indeed present in this system , with the shape of the emission line suggesting low inclination to the observer .",
    "the small variation in the spin period is also evidence of a low inclination system , assuming the circumstellar disk and the neutron star orbit lie in the same plane .",
    "w@xmath20 measurements of the h@xmath0 line reveal a growth in the emission of h@xmath0 photons from the system which is most likely a result of an increase in the size of the circumstellar disk ; an argument that is supported by the increase in optical luminosity that culminated in the most recent epoch of pulsed x - ray emission from the neutron star .",
    "folded x - ray light curves reveal the geometry of the emission region on the surface of the neutron star and show the highly variable nature of the accretion region . finally ,",
    "a simple estimate of the radius of the circumstellar disk was made , quantifying the size of the disk during periods of x - ray activity and during quiescence .",
