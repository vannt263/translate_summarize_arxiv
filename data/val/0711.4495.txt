    "while wetting of surfaces at or near thermal equilibrium is well understood  @xcite , the study of wetting phenomena _",
    "far _ from equilibrium is a challenging new field . in the past decade",
    "there have been numerous theoretical studies addressing the question whether non - equilibrium conditions may lead to different physical phenomena near the wetting transition .",
    "most of these studies are based on particular lattice models  @xcite or phenomenological langevin equations  @xcite .",
    "they all have in common that the wetting layer is modelled by a non - equilibrium growth process of a @xmath0-dimensional interface combined with a hard - core wall which represents the surface of the substrate .",
    "the theoretical interest in non - equilibrium wetting stems from the fact that various scale - invariant properties are found to be universal , i.e. , they are dictated by the symmetries of the model irrespective of microscopic details . for a growth process without a substrate ( free interface ) ,",
    "the most prominent universality classes are the edwards wilkinson ( ew ) and the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) universality classes  @xcite .",
    "these classes describe the asymptotic scaling behavior of the roughening interface and are characterized by a certain set of exponents and scaling functions  @xcite . in the corresponding langevin equations ,",
    "the kpz class differs from the ew class by a non - linear term that breaks reflection symmetry in height direction . in experimental setups , where this symmetry is generally broken , kpz behavior",
    "is expected to be generic while linear growth ( ew behavior ) can be considered as a special case .",
    "non - equilibrium wetting is usually modelled as a stochastic growth process on top of a hard - core substrate at height zero .",
    "varying the growth rate the presence of a substrate induces a wetting transition from a bound to a moving phase . concerning the scaling properties of the interface the substrate plays the role of a boundary : it does not change the universality class of the growth process itself , instead it imposes additional features .",
    "more specifically , it gives rise to an additional order parameter and an associated critical exponent .",
    "the situation is similar as e.g. in the ising model , where a boundary induces an additional surface critical exponent .",
    "we will refer to these extended universality classes as the _ bounded _ edwards - wilkinson ( bew ) and the _ bounded _ kardar - parisi - zhang ( bkpz ) class . for kpz - type growth",
    ", however , where the reflection symmetry is broken , it turns out that the new exponent also depends on the sign of the non - linear term .",
    "therefore , one has to distinguish two different bounded kpz classes , which we shall denote by the acronyms bkpz+ and bkpz according to the sign of the nonlinear term .",
    "one of these models for non - equilibrium wetting , which has been studied intensively in the past , was introduced a decade ago in ref .",
    "it is a restricted solid - on - solid ( rsos ) growth process on a @xmath1-dimensional lattice ( see sect . 2 for details ) , where the substrate is introduced by imposing the condition that all heights have to be non - negative .",
    "the phase diagram of this model is shown in fig . [ gphase1 ] .",
    "depending on the growth rate @xmath2 and the evaporation rate @xmath3 , the model exhibits a wetting transition from a bound to a moving phase . for @xmath4",
    "the transition was shown to belong to the bew universality class , while for @xmath5 the transition belongs to one of the two bounded kpz classes . however , the reported estimates for the critical exponents are still contradictory .",
    "one aim of the present paper is to clarify this issue and to confirm kpz scaling along the whole line except for @xmath6 and @xmath4 .",
    ", width=321 ]    [ gphase1 ]    as shown in the figure , the transition line ends at the left terminal point at @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in this point",
    "the wetting model reduces to a special growth process which was studied earlier by alon _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite and has the special property that evaporation from completed layers is forbidden .",
    "this means that the interface can not have a negative growth velocity and therefore the presence of a wall makes no difference .",
    "varying @xmath2 while keeping @xmath6 the model displays a roughening transition at @xmath8 .",
    "it was shown that the dynamics of sites at the bottom layer can be related to a directed percolation ( dp )  @xcite process , which is another class of non - equilibrium phase transitions different from both bew and bkpz . extending this analogy ,",
    "it was argued that the dynamics of the first few layers may be described in terms of unidirectionally coupled growth processes  @xcite .    an open question , which will be addressed in the present work , concerns the crossover from dp to the bkpz class in the vicinity of the dp point .",
    "in order to describe this crossover , we propose to interpret evaporation from the middle of a plateau with a small rate @xmath9 as a weak external field in the language of dp .",
    "this allows us to express the crossover exponent , which determines the characteristic shape of the transition line as it approaches the dp point , in terms of the response exponent of directed percolation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we estimate the critical exponents for the model for a wetting transition by off - critical , time - dependent , and finite - size simulations .",
    "moreover , we summarize a scaling picture for the bkpz@xmath10 and bew classes .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the crossover from dp class ( @xmath6 ) to bkpz class ( @xmath11 ) in the vicinity of the left terminal point of the transition line .",
    "finally we demonstrate that the proposed interpretation of the wetting model as a dp process with a external field is in agreement with numerical results .",
    "the model for non - equilibrium wetting proposed in ref.@xcite is defined on a one - dimensional lattice with @xmath12 sites and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "each site @xmath13 is associated with a variable @xmath14 which describes the height of the interface at site @xmath13 .",
    "the interface obeys the restricted solid - on - solid ( rsos ) condition @xmath15 i.e. , the heights at neighboring sites may differ by at most one unit .",
    "the interface evolves in time by random - sequential updates as follows . for each update a site @xmath13 of the lattice",
    "is randomly chosen and one of the following processes is selected ( cf .",
    "[ frates1 ] ) :    * deposition of a particle ( @xmath16 ) with rate @xmath2 , * evaporation of a particle ( @xmath17 ) at the edges of plateaus with rate @xmath18 , * evaporation of a particle ( @xmath17 ) from the middle of a plateau with rate @xmath3 .",
    "a move is rejected if it would violate the rsos condition .",
    "moreover , the substrate is introduced by imposing the restriction that evaporation at zero height is forbidden .",
    "each run starts with a flat interface at zero height . without loss of generality we set @xmath19 .",
    "the phase diagram of the model is shown in fig .  [ gphase1 ] .",
    "the transition is controlled by the growth rate @xmath2 . above the critical line",
    "the model is in the wet or moving phase , where the interface roughens and propagates at constant velocity . below the critical line",
    "the interface remains bound and fluctuates close to the wall .",
    "the value of the evaporation rate @xmath3 determines the type of the phase transition . from the physical point of view",
    "small values of @xmath3 are more realistic since evaporation at the edges of a plateau is usually more likely than in the middle .",
    "the order parameter for the wetting transition is the density of sites at zero height @xmath20 . in the bound phase near the transition line @xmath20 goes to zero as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the transition point and",
    "@xmath23 is a critical exponent .",
    "similarly , the interface width @xmath24 diverges at the transition as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is another critical exponent .",
    "the vertical line @xmath6 is special in so far as a layer , once completed , can not evaporate again . as already mentioned in the introduction , this special case was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and the exponent @xmath23 was found to be in agreement with the dp exponent @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was shown numerically that for @xmath6 the interface width diverges logarithmically near the critical point  @xcite , which is consistent with the critical exponent @xmath28 .",
    "another special case is @xmath4 , where the wetting transition belongs to the bounded edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) class . in this case the stationary state in the bound phase",
    "can be computed exactly by transfer matrix methods @xcite , which allows one to calculate the critical exponents @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "for @xmath11 the model shows a different critical behavior as in the equilibrium case @xmath4 .",
    "the first estimates reported in  @xcite , using off - critical numerical simulations at @xmath31 , are @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the purpose of this section is to revise these values , confirming the conjecture that in this regime the transition belongs to the bkpz class .",
    "similarly , for @xmath34 the transition is expected to belong to the bkpz+ class .",
    "( left ) and the interface width @xmath24 ( right ) as functions of the distance from the critical point @xmath35 . with @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 independent realizations.,width=321 ]",
    "first we calculate the exponents @xmath23 and @xmath26 by means of off - critical simulations . to reasons to be explained below , we use a very small value @xmath36 . from the graphs shown in fig .",
    "[ goff ] we obtain @xmath39 we believe that this estimate of @xmath23 is larger than the one obtained previously in  @xcite because of a crossover from ew to kpz behavior .",
    "this crossover is known to be notoriously slow and may cause the impression as if the critical exponents depended continuously on @xmath3 , varying from the ew exponent @xmath40 and some values larger than one . however , it seems that such an estimate is just an effective exponent measured in the crossover regime .",
    "as one approaches the critical line for @xmath41 and increases the numerical effort the effective exponent grows and slowly converges to the `true ' kpz exponent .",
    "this crossover from ew to kpz is expected to become more pronounced if we move away from the equilibrium case @xmath4 .",
    "for instance , with simulations at @xmath42 we would obtain the effective exponent @xmath43 .",
    "that is why we chose such a small value for @xmath3 .",
    "according to the standard scaling picture of non - equilibrium phase transitions , the spatial correlation length @xmath44 near the critical point diverges as @xmath45 for @xmath6 , where the model exhibits dp behavior , one obtains the dp values @xmath46 . for @xmath11 , where the model is in the bkpz class , we observe that the critical point , where the velocity of the free interface is zero , varies strongly with the system size .",
    "for instance , at @xmath36 for @xmath47 we found @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , it is near at hand to postulate the relation @xmath49 where the @xmath50 is the extrapolated value of the critical threshold . with @xmath51",
    "we obtain @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the data leading to this results , with @xmath54 as a function of @xmath12 , is shown in fig .",
    "we note that the extrapolated value @xmath52 already coincides with the value @xmath55 within error bars .     between the finite - size critical point @xmath56 and the extrapolated critical point @xmath52 as a function of @xmath12 for @xmath36.,width=321 ]    for finite growing interfaces , after an initial transient ,",
    "the correlation length @xmath44 becomes of the same order as the system size .",
    "when this happens the interface width saturates .",
    "the value at which the interface width saturates depends on @xmath12 and scales as  @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the saturation value of the interface width and @xmath59 is the so - called roughness exponent .",
    "this relation is valid above the critical point and at the critical point for @xmath60 . in one dimension",
    "one has @xmath61 for both the kpz and the ew class  @xcite .",
    "( [ eqalfa ] ) , ( [ eqperp ] ) , and ( [ eqzeta ] ) imply the relation @xmath62 from @xmath53 we obtain @xmath63 , which is significantly larger than the numerical estimate in the previous subsection .",
    "likewise , the temporal correlation length @xmath64 diverges close to criticality as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the temporal critical exponent . from this relation and eq .",
    "( [ eqbeta ] ) we can conclude that the bottom layer density @xmath20 decays at criticality according to a power law @xmath67 with @xmath68 the exponent @xmath69 was measured in ref.@xcite , simulating the so - called single step model which is known to belong to the bkpz class .",
    "our result @xmath70 , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ gtim ] , is compatible with their estimate @xmath71 .     at the critical point @xmath35 as a function of the number of monte",
    "carlo steps @xmath72 with @xmath36 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 independent realizations.,width=321 ]    the dynamical exponent @xmath75 , defined by @xmath76 for the kpz class is @xmath77  @xcite . with @xmath77 and our previous estimate of @xmath78",
    "we obtain @xmath79 .",
    "together with @xmath80 this means that @xmath81 .",
    "we note that both values @xmath82 and @xmath83 , obtained from finite - size and time - dependent simulations , are larger than the results obtained from off - critical simulations @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "we believe that these discrepancies can be traced back to the fact that the ew - kpz crossover is more influential in off - critical simulations .",
    "let us now summarize the scaling picture and the values of the critical exponents .",
    "one - dimensional wetting models , as the one defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , are characterized by four independent critical exponents , namely , three bulk exponents @xmath86 which take simple fractional values , and one exponent @xmath23 associated with the order parameter @xmath20 , whose value is only known numerically .",
    "these exponents , together with related exponents @xmath87 and @xmath88 , are listed in table  [ t2 ] .",
    "the scaling hypothesis states that any quantities are invariant under the scaling transformation @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a scaling factor and @xmath91 denotes the distance from criticality .",
    ".list of the critical exponents .",
    "most of dp exponents in the frist line come from @xcite , the exceptions are @xmath59 and @xmath26 that come form @xcite .",
    "the bew and bkpz exponents come from an exact result @xcite and the best numerical estimatives for the exponent @xmath69 obtained in @xcite respectively combined with the scaling picture developed here .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      as a function of @xmath92 with @xmath93  @xcite for the restricted model with the external field . in this case @xmath94 and @xmath95 is the number of independent realizations.,width=321 ]",
    "in this paper we have presented improved estimates of the critical exponents for the non - equilibrium wetting model of ref .",
    "@xcite in the parameter range @xmath11 .",
    "we have derived relations between the exponents , in agreement with the numerical results , and used them to give a complete set of the exponents along the whole transition line ( see table [ t2 ] ) .",
    "this work is focused on the case @xmath96 , where the wetting transition belongs to the bkpz class . for @xmath34 , where the transition belongs to the bkpz+ class",
    ", we could do a similar analysis but we would have to use extremely large values of @xmath3 to overcome crossover effects , but numerical simulations turn out to be inefficient in this limit .",
    "presently the most reliable results for the critical exponent @xmath69 of the bounded kpz classes were measured using the so - called single step model  @xcite .",
    "this model has a moving wall and is always exactly at the critical point .",
    "however , the single step model does not allow one to perform off - critical simulations .",
    "this is the reason why the wetting model is more suitable to confirm the scaling relations discussed in this paper .",
    "the non - equilibrium wetting model introduced in  @xcite has another interesting feature , namely , a special transition point at @xmath6 , where the critical behavior belongs to the directed percolation universality class .",
    "surprisingly , even for very small @xmath3 , the critical behavior changes entirely .",
    "for example , the exponent @xmath23 , which describes the density of sites at zero height , jumps from the dp value @xmath97 for @xmath6 to a large value @xmath98 of the bkpz class . to our knowledge , this is the only case where the order parameter exponent @xmath23 is larger than one .",
    "this is due to the fact that the interface at criticality has only very few contact points where it touches the wall .",
    "this number is so small that the correlation length @xmath44 of the interface fluctuations becomes smaller than the average distance between two contact points  @xcite , which is equal to the inverse of the density of sites at the bottom layer .    the main result of this work is the conjecture that a wetting process for small @xmath3 can be interpreted as a dp process in an external field .",
    "this conjecture allows us to interpret the crossover from the dp class to the bkpz class as a small external field @xmath92 that eliminates the dp transition .",
    "moreover , it is consistent with the scaling picture and can be confirmed by numerical simulations . calculating the corresponding crossover exponent @xmath99 , we can predict the shape of the critical line near @xmath6 .",
