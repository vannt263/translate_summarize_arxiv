    "in the quest towards understanding of a viable flavour structure of low - energy neutrino mass matrix adhering neutrino oscillation data , a general approach is to advocate flavour symmetries in conjunction with the standard @xmath7 model .",
    "those additional flavour symmetries are associated with some gauge group , discrete or continuous , and thereby dictating a well - defined theory to explain the extant data .",
    "this is a task to realize a comprehensive theory in the ultimate goal to comply with all experimental results . on the contrary ,",
    "realization of a viable neutrino mass matrix through the proposition of some ansatz at low energy is also a supportive way towards the quest of a more elucidative model .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    in the present work we investigate the latter idea considering two ansatzes , ( i)zeros in the yukawa texture , ( ii)a scaling property between the nonzero yukawa matrix elements , referred to as scaling ansatz@xcite-@xcite within the framework of a variant of seesaw mechanism known as linear seesawmechanism@xcite-@xcite .",
    "we do not touch the origin of those two well - studied ansatzes here , however , we bring the two ansatzs together here and investigate systematically the minimal number of parameters necessary to explain the neutrino experimental data within the above mentioned framework .",
    "we briefly mention few words regarding scaling ansatz .",
    "imposition of scaling ansatz correlates the nonzero elements of yukawa matrix by a scale factor and it can be achieved through different ways .",
    "one of the distinctive properties of scaling ansatz is that the texture remains invariant under renormalization group evolution .",
    "furthermore , this ansatz leads to @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "thus we are compelled to break the ansatz to generate nonzero @xmath10 .",

    "in linear seesaw , the effective neutrino mass matrix ( @xmath0 ) generated varies linearly with dirac neutrino mass matrix ( @xmath1 ) instead of quadratic variation as happens in type - i seesaw . in this popular variant of type - i",
    "seesaw along with left chiral sm doublet neutrinos ( @xmath11 ) and right chiral singlet neutrinos ( @xmath12 ) , extra fermion singlets ( @xmath13 ) are added . in effect",
    "the well - known type - i seesaw basis @xmath14 is extended to @xmath15 .",
    "linear seesaw mechanism arises when the mass matrix in the above basis takes the following form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a @xmath18 matrix assuming three generations of each fermions . to obtain light neutrino masses",
    ", we have to block diagonalize ( [ mnu1 ] ) and with the introduction of the following matrices @xmath19 the effective @xmath17 takes the form as @xmath20 which is exactly similar to that of type - i seesaw mass matrix . further assuming",
    "the hierarchy of type - i seesaw mechanism the light neutrino mass matrix is obtained easily as @xmath21 if the @xmath4 global lepton number symmetry breaking term @xmath22 is absent , ( [ mn ] ) is then simply reduced to @xmath23 this is our main working formula for the present work and we proceed further to calculate light neutrino masses and mixing angles with this @xmath0 imposing scaling ansatz and texture zeros on the mass matrices @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , without any loss of generality , we assume that the charged lepton mass matrix and @xmath3 are flavour diagonal . with such choice of basis",
    "it is not possible to consider further any other matrix flavour diagonal .",
    "there are several works@xcite-@xcite in which the scaling ansatz has been studied through its imposition on the columns of @xmath0 . in the present work we consider scaling ansatz at a more fundamental level through its implementation in @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , we impose this ansatz along the rows of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 matrices and we find that such choice of @xmath1 and @xmath2 leads to the same structure of @xmath0 , after invoking linear seesaw mechanism . scaling ansatz dictates that all the elements of a certain row of @xmath1 ( or @xmath2 ) are related to the elements of another row by a definite scale factor .",
    "this scaling relation may be of three types as ( i ) the first and second row are connected , ( ii ) the second and third row are connected or ( iii ) the first and third row are connected . the cases ( i ) and ( iii ) lead to @xmath24 or @xmath25 equals to zero and hence , we discard those cases . here",
    "we carry out our analysis for the case ( ii ) which is explicitly written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the column index ( @xmath28 ) and @xmath29 , @xmath30 are the scale factors for @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "we now check the effect of the scaling ansatz in the effective neutrino mass matrix @xmath0 . using the linear seesaw formula ( [ mnu4 ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath0 as @xmath31\\nonumber\\\\                      & = & -[k(m_d)_{\\tau j}(m_{rs}^t)^{-1}_{j l}(m_{ds})^t_{l \\alpha}+k_1(m_{ds})_{\\tau j}(m_{rs})^{-1}_{j l}(m_{d})^t_{l \\alpha } ] \\label{mnu5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where sum over repeated index is implied .",
    "it is clear from the above equation that the scaling ansatz is already broken by the choice of different scale factors for @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the ansatz can be restored in @xmath0 simply by choosing @xmath32 and then ( [ mnu5 ] ) becomes @xmath33 with @xmath34 and the scaling relations in @xmath0 are obtained as @xmath35 as we are aware of the fact that such type of scaling ansatz invariant matrices yield @xmath9 , we are compelled to deal with the case where @xmath36 .",
    "the explicit forms of @xmath1 and @xmath2 with scaling ansatz are given by @xmath37 and as mentioned earlier @xmath3 is taken diagonal as @xmath38",
    "in our scheme developed we further put constraint on @xmath1 and @xmath2 through the imposition of zeros and our aim here is to find out the maximum number of zeros that we can accommodate in @xmath1 and @xmath2 which will produce a phenomenologically viable @xmath0 .",
    "we start our analysis with 8 zero texture , and then move on by reducing the number of zeros .",
    "we calculate @xmath0 for all possible combinations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 and check how many of them can give rise to nonzero mixing angles and mass squared differences and how many can be ruled out at once using suitable arguments .",
    "first we tabulate scaling ansatz invariant @xmath39 zero ( where @xmath40 ) textures of @xmath1 ( and @xmath2 ) . in table",
    "[ t1 ] we represent the scaling ansatz invariant texture zero structures of @xmath1 matrices . first of all @xmath1 with @xmath41 zeros is not possible because scaling ansatz requires at least two nonzero elements ( one in each row connected by scaling ) .",
    "texture with @xmath42 zeros and @xmath43 zeros are allowed due to compatibility with scaling ansatz .",
    "+   +   + @xmath44 & @xmath44 & @xmath44 + and @xmath45 & and @xmath46 & and @xmath47 + @xmath48 & @xmath49 & @xmath50 +   + @xmath51 & @xmath52 & @xmath53 + and @xmath54 & and @xmath54&and @xmath54 + @xmath55 & @xmath56 & @xmath57 + @xmath52 & @xmath51 & @xmath53 + and @xmath58 & and @xmath58&and @xmath58 + @xmath59 & @xmath60 & @xmath61 + @xmath53 & @xmath51 & @xmath52 + and @xmath62 & and @xmath62&and @xmath62 + @xmath63 & @xmath64 & @xmath65 +    a table completely identical to table [ t1 ] can be constructed for @xmath2 matrix simply by the following substitutions : @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( where @xmath28 ) .",
    "thus there are three @xmath42 zero and nine @xmath43 zero textures allowed for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "now we calculate @xmath0 using linear seesaw formula ( [ mnu5 ] ) for all possible combinations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 and there are altogether @xmath69 different possible combinations . depending upon the position of zeros in the resulting @xmath0 matrices we divide those @xmath69 textures in @xmath41 classes and denote them as @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes generically some nonzero element .",
    "exact expression of @xmath71 comes out from the structure of corresponding @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "explicitly emergence of all those classified forms are shown in tables [ t2]-[t4 ] .",
    "the tables of @xmath0 ( tables [ t2]-[t4 ] ) are presented in a matrix form in which along the row we write the index of @xmath1 ( denoted as @xmath27 ) and along the columns the index of @xmath2 ( denoted as @xmath72 ) is assigned .",
    "hence the @xmath73th element of the table denotes the type of @xmath0 generated by the combination of @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we mark the surviving textures by bold letters in those tables .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    lets first check how many of these @xmath76 matrices have the potential to generate phenomenologically viable mixing angles and mass eigenvalues .",
    "it has been shown by frampton et.al@xcite that if the number of independent zeros in an effective neutrino mass matrix ( @xmath0 ) is @xmath77 3 , that matrix does nt favour the oscillation data .",
    "this result drastically eliminates the matrices from @xmath78 to @xmath79 .",
    "thus the matrices given in given in table [ t2 ] ( containing @xmath42 zero @xmath1 and @xmath42 zero @xmath2 ) are all ruled out . again",
    "although @xmath80 matrix survives this criteria ( since the number of independent zeros in @xmath80 matrix is only @xmath81 ) , however , one generation of neutrino is completely decoupled from the other two , and as a result two mixing angles become zero .",
    "hence we also neglect @xmath80 matrix .",
    "thus the number of surviving @xmath76 matrix is only @xmath81 and they are @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the matrix @xmath82 appears only in table [ t5 ] due to three different combinations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( @xmath43 zero @xmath1 with @xmath43 zero @xmath2 ) and matrix @xmath83 appears in tables [ t3]-[t5 ] due to total @xmath84 different combinations of the above matrices .",
    "both tables [ t3 ] ( combination of @xmath43 zero @xmath1 and @xmath42 zero @xmath2 ) and [ t4 ] ( @xmath42 zero @xmath1 and @xmath43 zero @xmath2 ) give three @xmath83 matrices each and table [ t5 ] gives three @xmath82 matrices and twelve @xmath83 matrices .",
    ".combination of @xmath42 zero @xmath85 and @xmath42 zero @xmath75 [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "our goal of this work is to describe a phenomenologically viable effective light neutrino mass matrix ( @xmath0 ) with minimum number of parameters .",
    "the light neutrino mass matrix @xmath0 is generated through linear seesaw mechanism where along with standard @xmath7 particle contents , three right chiral singlet neutrinos ( @xmath86 ) and three other fermion singlets ( @xmath87 ) are present .",
    "the @xmath18 majorana mass matrix obtained in this basis is further block diagonalized to get mass matrix for the light neutrinos . after imposing the assumption of absence of global @xmath4 symmetry",
    "breaking term we get the final working formula for @xmath0 which is composed of three matrices @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . without sacrificing any generality we are allowed to choose the charge lepton mass matrix and @xmath3 to be diagonal . to reduce the number of independent parameters our next idea is to invoke scaling ansatz in the two dirac type matrices @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the scaling ansatz is broken in final @xmath0 by choice of different scale factors for @xmath1 and @xmath2 to get rid of vanishing value of @xmath10 .",
    "the most important part of our analysis is to accommodate as many zeros as possible in those scaling ansatz invariant @xmath88 and @xmath2 .",
    "it is noticed that we can get at most three @xmath42 zero textures and nine @xmath43 zero textures for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "so their combination give rise to @xmath89 @xmath0 matrices .",
    "depending upon the positions of zeros and nonzero elements these @xmath69 textures are generically represented by eight matrices denoted as @xmath76 ( @xmath90 ) of which @xmath82 and @xmath83 are phenomenologically viable and the rest six are discarded . among @xmath69 @xmath0 matrices we get eighteen @xmath83 type matrices and three @xmath82 type matrices and",
    "the notable fact is that all three @xmath82 type matrices are generated by the combination of @xmath43 zero @xmath1 and @xmath43 zero @xmath2 where as @xmath83 type matrices emerged in all type of combinations except those of @xmath42 zero @xmath1 with @xmath42 zero @xmath2 .",
    "all the @xmath83 type matrices are recasted in two types of @xmath0 ( * cat i * and * cat ii * ) and @xmath82 type matrices can be represented by single @xmath0 matrix ( * cat iii * ) after phase redefinition and reparametrization .",
    "the numerical analysis is done thereafter .",
    "it is clear from the detailed numerical analysis that * cat i * and * cat ii * matrices are disfavoured by oscillation data and the only surviving @xmath0 belongs to * cat iii*. the mass ordering of the light neutrinos is normal and the value of @xmath5 is also below the present experimental lower limit . we conclude with a comment that to meet the phenomenological requirements we need at most two @xmath43 zero matrices ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) and one diagonal matrix @xmath3 while working with linear seesaw mechanism . increase in number of zeros in any of the two dirac type matrices will make the resulting @xmath0 phenomenologically invalid .",
