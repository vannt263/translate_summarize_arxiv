    "continuously evolving dynamical systems universally appear as models in every branch of natural science .",
    "their usefulness is determined by their predictivity which in turn hinges on the stability of their solutions . given some uncertainty in the measured initial conditions , a physically meaningful system should offer control on the possible evolution of deviations from a given reference trajectory . global control of late - time deviations is as important as a local understanding of stability .",
    "an extensive mathematical theory exists for the global stability of solutions of dynamical systems ; the fundamental quantities in this theory are the lyapunov exponents that measure exponential deviations  @xcite .",
    "these exponents are often very hard to determine analytically , and various approaches for their calculation are used in the literature  @xcite .",
    "sometimes the stability of the same dynamical system is considered from different points of view , and the corresponding lyapunov exponents are compared ; this leads to some debate on the question of which point of view is preferable  @xcite .",
    "the local stability of solutions of dynamical systems on the other hand seems less well understood . to our knowledge",
    ", the existing mathematical theory is applicable only to second order differential systems .",
    "it was developed by kosambi , cartan and chern  @xcite , and covers as a special case the local stability analysis of geodesics on a riemannian manifold via the jacobi equation .    in this article",
    "we describe dynamical systems and their perturbations in a unified geometric language which is reviewed in section  [ sec_language ] .",
    "this language has the advantage to specify very precisely the intrinsic geometric ingredients that define the dynamical system .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the translation of dynamical systems into geometry is unambiguous .",
    "however , this is not true for the definition of stability .",
    "we will clarify in section  [ sec_stability ] that stability in general is not an intrinsic notion but requires geometric structure not included in the definition of the dynamical system .",
    "this fact is not sufficiently appreciated in the literature .",
    "we will see that global lyapunov stability entails the choice of seminorms on the vector bundle of perturbations .",
    "we will then propose a general definition of local stability applicable to any dynamical system .",
    "this notion of local stability requires the choice of a linear connection , and reduces to standard stability criteria for second order systems .",
    "in contrast to the general case , lagrangian systems offer intrinsic geometric structures to define global and local stability , as we will discuss in section  [ sec_lagrange ] . we will then consider natural lagrangian systems in section  [ sec_natural ] for which independent notions of stability exist based on the translation of solutions into geodesics via the maupertuis - jacobi principle .",
    "we point out that this detour suffers from a number of limitations which are nicely resolved in the direct intrinsic approach valid for all lagrangian systems .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec_conclusion ] .",
    "in this section we review the basic geometric structure common to all dynamical systems and their perturbations . the geometric language used here will form the basis for our discussion of the stability of solutions in the following sections .    fundamentally",
    ", deterministic dynamical systems can be introduced as formal rules that describe the evolution of points in some set @xmath0 with respect to an external , discrete or continuous time parameter running in another set @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , a dynamical system is a map @xmath2 which satisfies @xmath3 for all times @xmath4",
    ". this bare definition must be enriched with additional structure if we want to model realistic dynamical systems .    in the following",
    "we will therefore concentrate on the important class of continuously evolving dynamical systems for which @xmath5 .",
    "geometrically , we focus on point sets @xmath0 that are differentiable manifolds , and assume that a vector field @xmath6 over @xmath0 is given : @xmath7 the integral curves @xmath8 of the vector field @xmath6 through a point @xmath9 are defined by two conditions : that their tangent vector @xmath10 agrees with the vector field at each point , and that @xmath11 . for simplicity",
    "we assume that these integral curves are defined for all times .",
    "then a dynamical system in the sense of ( [ dynsyst ] ) is defined by the flow of the vector field @xmath6 , i.e. , by setting @xmath12 .    any integral curve @xmath8 of the flow vector field @xmath6 provides a solution trajectory of the dynamical system with initial condition @xmath13 .",
    "perturbations of @xmath8 are studied by varying this initial condition .",
    "any curve @xmath14 with @xmath15 provides a continuous family of initial conditions which evolve under the dynamical system as @xmath16 .",
    "all curves so obtained are continuous variations of @xmath8 ; as a function of the two parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 we thus obtain a two - dimensional surface @xmath19 in @xmath0 , see figure  [ figure1 ] . in consequence",
    "the two tangent vectors @xmath6 and @xmath20 commute , @xmath21=0 $ ] . along the reference solution @xmath8 which lies in this surface at @xmath22 we can now study the evolution of the tangent vector @xmath23 .",
    "precisely this vector governs the linear stability of the solution  @xmath8 , i.e. , its stability with respect to infinitesimal perturbations .",
    "globally the perturbation vector field @xmath24 along @xmath8 is determined as the push - forward of an initial perturbation vector @xmath25 via @xmath26    to summarize , the dynamical systems @xmath27 that we will study in this paper have a very simple geometric structure :    * they are defined in terms of a flow vector field @xmath6 over some differentiable manifold @xmath0 ; * their solutions are integral curves of @xmath6 ; and * the linear perturbations of a solution @xmath8 are vector fields @xmath28 along @xmath8 for which @xmath21=0 $ ] .",
    "choosing local coordinates @xmath29 on @xmath0 , the dynamical system thus becomes a system of first - order differential equations over @xmath0 for the integral curves of the vector field @xmath6 , @xmath30 expanding the commutator condition @xmath21=0 $ ] for the linear perturbation gives @xmath31    these local expressions seem to suggest that the above framework for dynamical systems would only allow for first order differential equations on a configuration space",
    ". however , this crucially depends on the choice of manifold @xmath0 , its relation to the configuration space , and the type of flow vector field @xmath6 . to see this we now discuss in the same geometric framework the case of second order dynamical systems which will play a major role in this paper ( higher than second order construction require higher order tangent or jet bundles , see  @xcite ) .",
    "hence consider a system whose configuration space is modeled by a smooth manifold @xmath32 .",
    "initial conditions for a second order system consist of an initial position @xmath33 and an initial velocity @xmath34 . combining these into pairs @xmath35",
    ", one realizes that a natural geometric arena for second order systems is the tangent bundle @xmath36 .",
    "it is clear that not all vector fields over @xmath36 can produce second order dynamics on @xmath32 .",
    "indeed , a second order system is defined by a vector field @xmath6 on @xmath37 with the additional condition @xmath38 for all @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the push - forward of the projection map @xmath41 .",
    "this condition defines @xmath6 as a so - called semispray ; in local coordinates @xmath42 on @xmath36 one finds @xmath43 .",
    "this ensures that the integral curves of @xmath6 , which satisfy @xmath44 represent a second order differential evolution on the configuration space @xmath32 . in geometrical terms , the integral curves @xmath45 of @xmath6 become natural lifts @xmath46 to @xmath36 of curves @xmath47 in @xmath32 .",
    "once second order systems on @xmath32 have been rewritten as ( special cases of ) first order systems on @xmath37 , perturbations of solutions can be analyzed as before .",
    "the perturbation @xmath48 along a given solution @xmath45 will now be a vector field over @xmath36 with @xmath21=0 $ ] .",
    "it is instructive to expand this condition in local coordinates @xmath42 on @xmath36 , which yields @xmath49 as expected , the perturbation equation can be read as a second order differential equation . hence we see that the simple geometric framework for dynamical systems and perturbations of solutions can be easily applied to higher order dynamics .",
    "in the previous section we have defined dynamical systems @xmath27 via vector fields @xmath6 and their associated flow on some differentiable manifold @xmath0",
    ". we have also presented the geometric language to define linear perturbations of specific solutions as connecting vector fields that commute with  @xmath6 . in this section",
    "we discuss the issue of the stability of solutions under such linear perturbations , both globally and locally .",
    "we will find that stability generally is not intrinsic to a dynamical system , but requires additional geometric structure beyond @xmath0 and @xmath6 to be well - defined .",
    "consider a solution @xmath50 of a dynamical system @xmath27 .",
    "the linear perturbations of such a solution are described by tangent vector fields @xmath28 along @xmath45 and satisfy @xmath21=0 $ ] .",
    "given an initial perturbation @xmath51 , the dynamical system completely determines the evolution of @xmath28 along the solution @xmath45 via the push - forward as in equation ( [ pushf ] ) .",
    "since , intuitively , @xmath28 points to a neighboring solution , we wish to call @xmath45 unstable , if any choice of @xmath52 results in exponential deviations of @xmath28 for late times .    in order to implement this idea",
    ", we proceed in two steps .",
    "first we need to quantify the size of a perturbation @xmath28 ; so the tangent bundle @xmath53 must be equipped with a family of ( semi-)norms @xmath54 for each point @xmath13 of @xmath0 .",
    "this is additional structure not provided in the definition of the dynamical system @xmath27 .",
    "second , once this geometric structure is available , we are in the position to define the so - called lyapunov exponent @xcite @xmath55 for given initial point @xmath56 and initial perturbation vector @xmath51",
    ". exponential growth of a perturbation will result in positive lyapunov exponent @xmath57 ; therefore , a given trajectory identified by @xmath58 is defined as stable if and only if @xmath59 is non - positive for all initial perturbations  @xmath52 .",
    "this is a definition of global stability because the lyapunov exponents are evaluated for late times .",
    "we note that the lyapunov exponents and the notion of global lyapunov stability can be straightforwardly applied to any dynamical system formulated as a vector flow .",
    "for instance , in the case of a second order system over a configuration space @xmath32 , which we have seen is a vector flow over @xmath37 , the additional geometric structure needed to define global stability is a family of seminorms on the bundle @xmath60 .",
    "we will see this construction at work below .    even though a family of seminorms is sufficient to define ( [ lyap ] ) ,",
    "many general results in the theory of lyapunov exponents have been achieved by equipping @xmath0 with a riemannian metric and considering the associated family of norms on @xmath53 . in this case",
    ", it can be shown that for a given point  @xmath13 the lyapunov exponent @xmath61 can assume at most @xmath62 distinct values , @xmath63 .",
    "moreover , there exists a so called filtration @xmath64 such that @xmath65 for  @xmath66 .",
    "so initial perturbations from this subset of @xmath67 result at late times in exponential deviations controlled by the corresponding lyapunov exponent .",
    "stability theory based on lyapunov exponents is a vast subject ; we will not detail its major achievements here but refer the interested reader e.g. to @xcite .",
    "we only remark the following notable result : on a compact riemannian manifold @xmath0 , the supremum limit in ( [ lyap ] ) can be replaced by the ordinary limit which , moreover , is finite and independent of the particular riemannian metric defined on @xmath0 .",
    "one could suspect that , even though the lyapunov exponent quantitatively depends on the specific choice of seminorms on @xmath53 , the qualitative notion of stability would not",
    ". the actual independence of lyapunov exponents from a riemannian metric on compact manifolds seems to favor this hypothesis .",
    "however , the following simple example immediately reveals that this is not the case .",
    "consider the inverted harmonic oscillator over @xmath68 with lagrangian @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "it is easy to see that the associated flow vector field on @xmath36 is given by @xmath71 .",
    "a generic perturbation of the solution @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are arbitrary constants parametrizing the possible choices for the initial perturbation vector @xmath76 .",
    "the point @xmath13 at @xmath77 has coordinates @xmath78 .",
    "the simple choice of seminorms induced on @xmath36 by the euclidean metric @xmath79 gives the lyapunov exponents @xmath80 the lyapunov spectrum is then given by @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is associated to the subspace @xmath83 of @xmath84 and @xmath85 to its complement .",
    "therefore the solution is classified as unstable .",
    "however , why should we not consider the metric @xmath86 ?",
    "then the lyapunov exponent @xmath87 vanishes ( excluding the fixed point case @xmath88 ) .",
    "the solution is now classified as stable in contradiction to the previous result .",
    "we emphasize that the key point behind the lyapunov notion of global stability of the trajectories of a dynamical system @xmath27 is the necessity for additional geometric structure : seminorms on @xmath53 that can measure the size of the perturbation .",
    "we now turn to a very intuitive proposal for the local stability of solutions of any dynamical system @xmath27 .",
    "we wish to classify a solution @xmath50 as locally stable if the acceleration between @xmath50 and a neighboring solution is negative , i.e. , if the curves are forced together . to implement this technically , we need to be able to calculate the second derivative of the perturbation vector field @xmath28 that points to the neighboring solutions .",
    "the only derivative that is available without introducing further structure is the lie derivative , but already the first derivative @xmath89=0 $ ] vanishes .",
    "so we need to require another derivative .",
    "the definition of local stability again proceeds in two steps .",
    "first , we introduce a linear connection @xmath90 that sends a pair of vector fields @xmath91 over @xmath0 to another vector field over @xmath0 . using the connection",
    ", one finds that the second covariant derivative of @xmath28 along the flow @xmath6 is a linear operator on @xmath53 which can be written as @xmath92\\cdot\\xi = \\tilde r(x)\\cdot \\xi\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath93 $ ] is the torsion tensor of @xmath94 , and both @xmath95 and @xmath96 are linear operators on @xmath53 .",
    "second , we define a solution @xmath50 of the dynamical system as locally stable if all eigenvalues of the linear operator @xmath97 evaluated along @xmath50 are non - positive .    to our knowledge",
    "this definition of local stability , which can be applied to dynamical systems of any order , has not appeared in the literature .",
    "however , we will now show that our proposal has a very nice relation to kcc stability theory as developed by kosambi , cartan and chern @xcite for second order dynamical systems over a configuration space manifold  @xmath32 .",
    "we have already seen that these systems are defined as vector flows over the tangent bundle  @xmath37 in terms of a semispray  @xmath6 . without loss of generality",
    "we may use local coordinates @xmath98 on @xmath0 to write @xmath99    to discuss the geometry of the dynamical system so defined , kcc introduce a non - linear connection @xmath100 on @xmath32 with coefficients @xmath101 .",
    "this can be understood in terms of a dynamical covariant derivative @xmath102 : for two vector fields @xmath103 over @xmath32 , @xmath104\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^b}\\,.\\ ] ] ( in the special case of a linear connection one simply has @xmath105 . )",
    "using @xmath102 one can rewrite the second order equation in  ( [ 2perturbation2 ] ) , which governs the evolution of a perturbation vector  @xmath106 over @xmath32 , in the form @xmath107 for a linear operator @xmath108 on @xmath36 the components of which may be found e.g. in @xcite : @xmath109 a solution @xmath50 of the dynamical system is called kcc - stable if all eigenvalues of  @xmath108 evaluated along @xmath50 are non - positive .    now to define local stability of the system @xmath110 with @xmath6 provided by ( [ sem ] ) according to our proposal , we need to specify a linear connection @xmath94 over @xmath37 instead of a non - linear connection over @xmath32 .",
    "for this purpose we note that for every non - linear connection @xmath100 on @xmath32 exists an associated compatible linear connection @xmath94 on @xmath36 , which is said to be of berwald type .",
    "technical details and the global form of this linear connection are given in  @xcite .",
    "the components of @xmath94 are defined by @xmath111 with respect to a basis @xmath112 of @xmath113 .",
    "choosing the basis @xmath114 adapted to  @xmath100 , the only non - vanishing connection components are @xmath115 in the same basis , we now calculate the linear operator @xmath116 on @xmath60 defined in  ( [ rlin ] ) , the eigenvalues of which are relevant for our proposal for local stability .",
    "the result has the form @xmath117\\ ] ] in terms of the deviation tensor @xmath108 that appears in the stability equation ( [ kccs ] ) of kcc theory , of @xmath118 , of @xmath119 , and of two more tensors @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "we only need to know that @xmath122 implies @xmath123 ; in this case the eigenvalues of @xmath97 are precisely those of @xmath108 , so our definition of local stability reduces to the kcc definition . note that @xmath122 is solved by @xmath124 where @xmath125 is homogeneous in @xmath126 of degree two .",
    "we will see that semisprays with such @xmath127 arise from natural lagrangian systems .",
    "so our criterion for local stability agrees with the kcc criterion for all natural lagrangian systems .",
    "the fact that local stability of a second order system can be equivalently understood in terms of a nonlinear connection on @xmath32 or in terms of a linear connection on @xmath36 as we propose was already shown for  @xmath128 in  @xcite , but in a different way .",
    "this is in fact the only case where the kcc stability treatment seems to be natural , because the second order system then takes the autoparallel form @xmath129 .",
    "but also the berwald type connection satisfies @xmath130 . for all other cases",
    "we do not consider a non - linear connection a particularly natural structure .",
    "another point in favor of our linear connection proposal is the fact that it is naturally defined for any dynamical system @xmath27 , not only for those related to second order dynamics .",
    "we emphasize that the key point behind the notion of local stability of the trajectories of a dynamical system @xmath27 here proposed is the necessity for additional geometric structure : a connection @xmath94 on @xmath53 that allows to measure the acceleration between nearby curves .",
    "both the definitions of global and local stability of the solutions of generic dynamical systems  @xmath27 require the choice of additional geometric structure : in the first case seminorms have to be chosen on  @xmath53 to measure the size of the perturbation ; in the second case a connection on  @xmath53 has to be chosen to measure local accelerations",
    ".    however , some dynamical systems may provide natural choices . in the case of geodesics on a riemannian manifold @xmath131 , which can be seen as a second order dynamical system @xmath110 , natural choices exist for the seminorms as well as for a connection on @xmath60 .",
    "the seminorms for the definition of global lyapunov stability can be constructed from any one of the well - known lifts of the metric @xmath132 to the tangent bundle which are discussed in detail in  @xcite .",
    "as an example we may choose seminorms @xmath133 on @xmath113 by employing the vertical lift of @xmath132 to @xmath36 which is defined by @xmath134 for vector fields @xmath91 on @xmath36 .",
    "this construction relates instability to the exponential divergence of trajectories purely in the configuration space . in the notation of ( [ 2perturbation ] ) the degenerate bilinear form @xmath135 projects out the components @xmath136 .",
    "indeed , for a geodesic @xmath137 with initial condition @xmath138 and initial perturbation @xmath139 , the lyapunov exponents are simply calculated as @xmath140    affinely parametrized geodesics with tangent vector field @xmath141 over @xmath32 obey the equation @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the levi - civita linear connection over @xmath32 determined by the metric @xmath132 .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , there is a linear connection @xmath94 over @xmath36 naturally associated to @xmath143 ( which now plays the role of @xmath100 ) .",
    "the connection @xmath94 of berwald type is nothing else but the horizontal lift @xmath144 of  @xmath143 to  @xmath36 ; see  @xcite for details .",
    "according to our definition , local stability of a geodesic requires that the eigenvalues of @xmath116 as defined in  ( [ rlin ] ) should be non - positive . from the calculation made above in the comparison to kcc theory",
    "we hence deduce that local stability becomes equivalent to the eigenvalues of @xmath145 being non - positive .",
    "considering the geodesic deviation equation @xmath146 for a simple perturbation @xmath147=0 $ ] on @xmath32 then tells us that our notion for the local stability of geodesics naturally reduces to the standard definition of geodesic stability .",
    "so geodesics admit natural definitions of global as well as local stability . in the following section",
    "we will show that also lagrangian systems offer intrinsic notions of global and local stability .",
    "in the previous sections we have introduced all necessary ingredients for a discussion of the stability of solutions of lagrangian systems on some configuration space manifold @xmath32 . in order to apply the geometric machinery we will first formulate these systems as vector flows over  @xmath36 .",
    "then we will demonstrate the existence of natural notions of stability that do not require further information apart from that given by the lagrangian system itself .",
    "a lagrangian system is a pair @xmath148 of a configuration space manifold @xmath32 and a lagrangian function @xmath149 .",
    "locally this is a function @xmath150 of coordinates @xmath151 on  @xmath32 and coordinates  @xmath152 on @xmath153 that give the components of a vector @xmath126 in the coordinate - induced basis @xmath154 .",
    "the trajectories of the lagrangian system are the curves @xmath155 with tangent vectors @xmath156 for which the variation of the action integral vanishes , @xmath157=\\delta\\int_{t_1}^{t_2 }   l(\\gamma(t),\\dot{\\gamma}(t))\\,dt\\,.\\ ] ] in the variation the curve s endpoints @xmath158 and @xmath159 are held fixed .",
    "once coordinates have been chosen , solutions @xmath160 must satisfy the euler - lagrange equations @xmath161    as any second order dynamical system , a lagrangian system can be described as a vector flow @xmath6 on @xmath37 . since",
    "this formulation is not so well - known , we present the relevant steps following  @xcite .",
    "first , one defines the liouville vector field @xmath162 on @xmath36 .",
    "this produces the energy function @xmath163 by @xmath164 .",
    "now recall that a vector field @xmath165 on @xmath36 is said to be vertical if it is tangent to the fiber , @xmath166 .",
    "moreover , a vector @xmath167 on @xmath32 , has an associated vertical lift @xmath168 to @xmath36 . combining the vertical lift and @xmath40",
    "defines a @xmath169 tensor field @xmath0 on @xmath36 by @xmath170 ; in coordinates , @xmath171 . with these ingredients",
    ", we can construct the two - form @xmath172 on @xmath36 . as a final step , the vector field @xmath6",
    "generating the lagrangian flow is the unique vector field @xmath6 solving @xmath173 this construction is easily understood in a local chart @xmath174 of @xmath36 .",
    "simple algebra shows that @xmath175 writing @xmath176 , condition ( [ elgeo ] ) is equivalent to @xmath177 this shows that the vector field @xmath6 on @xmath36 is a semispray , as needed for a second order dynamical system .",
    "the integral curves of @xmath6 indeed solve the euler - lagrange equations .      within the geometric picture of lagrangian systems",
    "@xmath148 as dynamical systems @xmath110 we are now in the position to ask for the stability of solutions . we will discuss global and local stability in turn .",
    "the definition of global stability via lyapunov exponents requires the specification of a family of seminorms on the tangent bundle @xmath53 .",
    "a lagrangian system provides us with an intrinsic object that can be used for this purpose , see e.g. @xcite : the generalized lagrange metric @xmath178 although the coefficients of @xmath132 depend on the fiber coordinates @xmath126 for generic lagrangians",
    "@xmath179 , the generalized lagrange metric transforms under coordinate transformations of @xmath37 as a @xmath180-tensor on @xmath32 .",
    "regularity of the lagrangian corresponds to @xmath181 .",
    "the situation for the lagrangian system is now very similar to that of geodesics on a riemannian manifold . instead of lifting the riemannian metric to @xmath36",
    ", we simply need to extend the generalized lagrange metric  @xmath132 to @xmath36 . as for lifts , there are several possibilities . as an example we consider the case , where @xmath132 as displayed above is simply read as a tensor over @xmath36 . for a reference solution @xmath137 with initial condition @xmath138 and initial perturbation @xmath139 , the lyapunov exponents",
    "are then simply calculated as @xmath182 this is of the same form as the formula for geodesics where we used the vertical lift of the riemannian metric .",
    "so this choice of seminorms measures the exponential deviation of perturbations purely within the configuration space @xmath32 .    to define the local stability of solutions of @xmath148 we need to specify a linear connection acting on vector fields on @xmath37 .",
    "again the lagrangian system provides us with an intrinsic choice .",
    "we may simply use the berwald type linear connection @xmath94 on @xmath36 which is associated to any given semispray .",
    "the relevant quantities @xmath127 and @xmath101 needed to determine this connection follow by combining ( [ sem ] ) , ( [ lvec ] ) and the definition of the generalized lagrange metric : @xmath183 in the basis @xmath114 of @xmath53 the connection @xmath94 is then provided by the connection coefficients  ( [ bconn ] ) .",
    "both the global and local stability of solutions of a lagrangian system @xmath148 can be defined intrinsically , without the introduction of further geometric structure .",
    "this makes essential use of the fact that the lagrangian system can be rewritten in the dynamical system language as a vector flow @xmath6 over @xmath37 .",

    "for the discussion of both global or local stability this means that only perturbations leaving the energy fixed can be considered . from the lagrangian point of view an initial perturbation",

    "both concepts become meaningless for one - dimensional systems .    after analyzing the different aspects of the geometric picture",
    ", we conclude that the riemannian way to define stability suffers from a number of limitations .",
    "general dynamical systems can not be mapped into a unique riemannian manifold , which leads to the presence of singular boundaries that may spoil the method of any predictive power .",

    "full control on perturbations that change energy is expected ; indeed , the additional contribution from the potential in  ( [ soform ] ) in contrast to  ( [ geomsplit ] ) removes possible degeneracies that could be responsible for a reduced number of lyapunov exponents .",
    "one - dimensional systems do not pose a problem for the intrinsic formalism , as we have already seen in the example of the inverted harmonic oscillator .",
    "the use of geometric language clearly specifies the intrinsic ingredients of a given physical system , and at the same time clarifies which mathematical structures may be meaningfully used . in this article",
    "we have analyzed the stability of solutions of dynamical systems in geometric language .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to the important class of continuously evolving systems which can be formulated as vector flows @xmath6 over some smooth manifold @xmath0 .",
    "although the solutions simply are integral curves of the vector field @xmath6 , this is not a restriction to first order systems ; the order rather depends on the choice of @xmath27 .",
    "linear perturbations of reference solutions are characterized by vector fields  @xmath28 over @xmath0 that commute with @xmath6 . within this basic framework",
    "we have reconsidered the question of the stability of solutions under linear perturbations .",
    "for the analysis of global stability exists the extensive mathematical theory of lyapunov exponents . here",
    "the use of the geometric formulation nicely clarifies that global stability in general is not an intrinsic notion .",
    "it requires outside information that has to be added to the dynamical system  @xmath27 .",
    "more precisely , a family of seminorms has to be given on the tangent bundle @xmath53 .",
    "this arbitrariness of choice is not sufficiently appreciated in the literature that applies the global stability concept .    in order to analyze the local stability of solutions of @xmath27",
    "we have proposed a very intuitive new criterion that requires the additional choice of a linear connection on @xmath53 to measure local accelerations .",
    "hence also local stability in general is not intrinsic to the dynamical system .",
    "the connection criterion for local stability is applicable to any dynamical system . for the case of second order systems",
    "we have shown how it reduces to the stability theory of kosambi , cartan and chern .",
    "in fact , the new criterion is precisely equivalent to kcc theory for natural lagrangian systems .",
    "some dynamical systems contain sufficient geometrical structure to allow for completely intrinsic definitions of global and local stability .",
    "it is well - known that this is the case for geodesics on a riemannian manifold .",
    "but notably , we have shown that this is also the case for general lagrangian systems @xmath148 .",
    "writing them as dynamical systems @xmath110 shows that the definition of global lyapunov stability proceeds from the generalized lagrange metric which simply is extended to the bundle  @xmath53 .",
    "local stability according to the newly proposed connection criterion uses the berwald type connection on @xmath53 associated to the lagrangian semispray @xmath6 .",
    "no previous notion of local stability seems to cover general lagrangian systems .    for natural lagrangian systems given by lagrangians quadratic in the velocities ,",
    "the jacobi - maupertuis principle is commonly applied to translate solutions of fixed energy into geodesics of an associated riemannian manifold .",
    "we have compared the resulting notions of geodesic stability with the intrinsic notions derived from the lagrangian system .",
    "we have pointed out that geodesic stability suffers from various illnesses : boundaries of the riemannian manifold that are curvature singular ; the non - ability to resolve perturbations that modify energy ; and the complete breakdown of the analysis for one - dimensional systems . none of these issues troubles the intrinsic definitions of stability in the lagrangian picture .",
    "the main achievement of this article lies in clarifying in a geometric framework the structures that underlie any discussion of the global or local stability of solutions of dynamical systems .",
    "it has emerged that the geometry of dynamical systems forces us to define a new criterion for local stability in terms of a choice of linear connection .",
    "our comparison of this criterion to the geodesic stability of natural lagrangian systems already shows a number of advantages of the intrinsic geometric approach .",
