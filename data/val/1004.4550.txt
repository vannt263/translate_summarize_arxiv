    "spinfoams @xcite provide a covariant formulation of the dynamics of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite ( see @xcite for an up - to - date status report ) .",
    "the dynamics is described in terms of transition amplitudes between states belonging to the kinematical hilbert space of lqg . in particular ,",
    "when the spin - network basis is used , the transition amplitude is a function of spins and intertwiners associated to the links and the nodes of the spin - network graph . in the recent literature @xcite , spinfoams are generally defined in terms of these variables : a space - time configuration in the spinfoam sum is understood as a @xmath0-complex with faces labeled by @xmath1-spins and edges labeled by @xmath1-intertwiners .",
    "different representations of the hilbert space of lqg can be lifted to the covariant level in spinfoams . in this paper",
    "we consider two representations for spinfoams .",
    "the first is a _",
    "holonomy representation_. this representation allows to write spinfoams into a form closer to a feynman path - integral : as an integral over the ashtekar connection smeared along links that slice faces of the spinfoam @xmath0-complex .",
    "the second is the _",
    "holomorphic representation _",
    ": it is based on the segal - bargmann transform for theories of connections introduced by ashtekar , lewandowski , marolf , mouro and thiemann @xcite .",
    "clearly , spinfoams in different representations have the same physical content .",
    "what the new representations provide is new insights and new calculational tools . in particular ,",
    "the holomorphic representation offers a new way of understanding the semiclassical behavior of spinfoams .",
    "the holomorphic representation is associated to coherent spin - network states @xcite,@xcite .",
    "these states are peaked on a classical intrinsic _ and _ extrinsic discrete geometry of space .",
    "this fact has a remarkable consequence that we discuss below .",
    "recently , the large scale asymptotics of the @xmath2 spinfoam vertex has been derived @xcite .",
    "the analysis has been done using the representation in terms of spins and normals introduced by livine and speziale @xcite . for a geometric set of boundary data , the asymptotics of the lorentzian",
    "vertex features a sum over two classical solutions .",
    "this leads to a cosine of regge action , similarly to what happens in @xmath3d for the ponzano - regge model .",
    "we argue that the presence of the second undesired classical solution in the semiclassical expansion is an artifact of the representation used : the representation in terms of spins and normals diagonalizes the area operator ; as a result , it has a maximal spread on its conjugate momentum and can not completely identify a point in phase space . on the other hand ,",
    "the holomorphic representation discussed in this paper is based on coherent spin - networks .",
    "these states are peaked both on the area and on its conjugate variable , an extrinsic angle .",
    "this is enough to select one of the two classical solutions in the semiclassical expansion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "i we discuss the holonomy representation of spinfoams and its relation with the two representations mostly used in the literature : the ` spin and intertwiner ' representation and the ` spin and normals ' representation .",
    "then , in section ii , we introduce the holomorphic representation as the segal - bargmann transform of the holonomy representation .",
    "moreover we discuss the interpretation of the complex variables used in terms of discrete classical geometries . in sections",
    "iii and iv , we derive the expression of the euclidean and the lorentzian spinfoam vertex both in the holonomy and in the holomorphic representation . in section",
    "v , we discuss an application of the derived formulae : we show how the peakedness on the extrinsic geometry allows to select a single classical solution in the analysis of the large scale asymptotics of the lorentzian spinfoam vertex .",
    "in lqg , the hilbert space associated to a graph @xmath4 embedded in a 3-dimensional hypersurface @xmath5 is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number of links of the graph and @xmath8 the number of nodes . in the ` holonomy representation ' ,",
    "a state is a gauge invariant function of @xmath1 group elements @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) that is invariant under @xmath1 gauge transformations at nodes , @xmath11 here @xmath12 and @xmath13 are respectively the node that is source / target of the link @xmath14 . the configuration variables @xmath15 are interpreted as holonomies of the ashtekar - barbero connection @xmath16 along the link @xmath14 of the graph ( @xmath17 is the spin - connection , @xmath18 the extrinsic curvature of the hypersurface @xmath5 , and the real number @xmath19 is the barbero - immirzi parameter ) .",
    "spinfoams provide the transition amplitude from an ` in ' state to an ` out ' state : they are maps that correspond to the formal expression @xmath20=\\int_{g^{\\text{\\tiny $ ( 3)$}}_{\\text{in}}}^{g^{\\text{\\tiny $ ( 3)$}}_{\\text{out } } } d g^{\\text{\\tiny $ ( 4)$}}\\ ; \\exp i s[g^{\\text{\\tiny $ ( 4)$}}].\\ ] ] for the transition amplitude of @xmath3-geometries in terms of a sum over @xmath21-geometries @xcite .",
    "the formalism admits a generalization to ` boundary amplitudes ' @xcite .",

    "a `` face amplitude '' is present : it is given by a delta function of a product of the holonomies @xmath27 bounding a face @xmath30 of the @xmath0-complex .",
    "it is needed in order to guarantee the composition law of the spinfoam amplitude @xcite .",
    "notice that we are associating a boundary graph to each vertex of the @xmath0-complex , therefore the holonomies @xmath27 have a vertex label @xmath31 and a link label @xmath14 .",
    "the association of variables is depicted in fig.[figura ] .",
    "dethe construction is the following : we consider a @xmath21-ball that contains a single vertex of the @xmath0-complex @xmath29 ; the boundary graph associated to the vertex is defined as the intersection of the portion of the @xmath0-complex contained in the @xmath21-ball and the boundary of the @xmath21-ball ( a 3-sphere ) .",
    "in particular , the boundary graph has as many links as faces of the @xmath0-complex intersecting at the vertex .",

    "are associated to the internal face @xmath30 as well as to the external face @xmath33 .",
    "the notation is the following : @xmath31 are spinfoam vertices and @xmath14 are links intersection of the faces with a small 3-sphere centered on the corresponding vertex .",
    "the boundary holonomy @xmath34 is associated to the external side ( dashed line ) of the boundary face @xmath33.,width=151 ]    as an example , the vertex amplitude of the ponzano - regge model for 3d gravity is given by @xmath35 in the case of the ponzano - regge model , the boundary graph is a complete graph with four ( 3-valent ) nodes .",
    "similarly , the vertex proposed by engle - pereira - rovelli - livine and freidel - krasnov ( eprl - fk ) @xcite was originally defined on a complete graph with @xmath36 ( 4-valent ) nodes .",
    "more recently , kaminski - kisielowski - lewandowski have proposed a version of the eprl - fk vertex that provides a generalization to arbitrary boundary graphs @xcite .",

    "spinfoam vertices are generally presented using a different representation : the ` spin and intertwiner ' representation , @xmath37 .",
    "this representation is related to the holonomy representation by the peter - weyl transform ( see table [ tab ] ) .",
    "this is the representation associated to an orthonormal basis of the boundary hilbert space @xmath22 .",

    "a spinfoam vertex can be written in the ` spin and normals ' representation , @xmath59 the reason why this representation is so useful in the semiclassical analysis of the vertex is that the normals @xmath50 are classical variables , as opposed to the intertwiners in ( [ eq : spin and intertwiner ] ) that are quantum numbers .",

    "we argue here that the appearence of a sum over classical solutions in the asymptotics of @xmath202 is exactly analogous to what happens in the simpler case discussed at the beginning of this section ( [ eq : h to 0 ] ) : it is due to the fact that the ` spin and normals ' representation does not identify a point in phase space .",
    "let us see now what happens in the holomorphic representation ( [ eq : w = sumj ] ) when we use the result ( [ eq : barrett ] ) .",
    "our boundary data now are not just areas and normals @xmath208 , there are also the angles @xmath97 that are conjugate to the areas .",
    "let us assume that the areas and the normals are compatible with the edge - lengths of a @xmath21-simplex is . ] . plugging ( [ eq : barrett ] ) into ( [ eq : w = sumj ] ) we have @xmath209 in the sum over spins there is now a rapidly oscillating phase term @xmath210 analogously to expression ( [ eq : p ] ) ,",
    "the quantity @xmath211 is the momentum computed out of regge action for given boundary data : @xmath212 therefore the sum over spins is suppressed unless the variable @xmath97 in the boundary data is chosen to coincide with @xmath213 or @xmath214 . in either case , only one of the two classical solutions contributes to the semiclassical behavior of the vertex .",
    "in this paper we have introduced a holomorphic representation for spinfoams .",
    "the 4d spinfoam vertex for gravity has a rather elegant expression in this representation : it is given by formula ( [ eq : weprl h],[eq : p h ] ) in the euclidean case and by ( [ eq : lor h],[faceterm ] ) in the lorentzian case .",
    "this new representation is obtained introducing first a holonomy representation and then computing its segal - bargmann transform .",
    "a spinfoam amplitude in the holomorphic representation is a function @xmath215 of @xmath63 elements @xmath62 , one per link of the boundary graph @xmath4 .",
    "the set of variables @xmath62 describe a truncation of the phase space of general relativity as captured by the graph @xmath4 .",
    "they admit a parametrization in terms of the variables generally used for describing the classical boundary geometry of a spinfoam configuration : ( i ) 3-normals to faces of a cellular decomposition of space , ( ii ) the area of faces , ( iii ) an angle associated to faces that measures the extrinsic curvature at the interface of two cells .",
    "these data describe the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of the boundary and can be coded into @xmath63 elements @xmath62 via equation ( [ eq : hl ] ) .",
    "therefore , we have a description of spinfoams in terms of variables with a clear geometrical meaning",
    ".    the holomorphic representation of spinfoams can be fruitfully used for analyzing their semiclassical behavior . in section",
    "v , we focused on a spinfoam vertex in the holomorphic representation and showed that a single exponential of the regge action contributes to the large scale asymptotics .",
    "what selects one of the two exponentials appearing in the `` spin and normals '' representation is the peakedness of the boundary state on a prescribed extrinsic curvature .",
    "it is important to understand if this feature extends beyond the single vertex level . a way to attack",
    "the problem is to derive an action in holomorphic variables following the method introduced in @xcite and then checking if a mechanism of cancellation of phases as proposed in @xcite is at work .",
    "finally , we suggest a way to use the holomorphic representation to make a bridge with the hamiltonian framework .",
    "roughly , let us consider a holomorphic transition amplitude ( propagation kernel ) @xmath216 between an initial state labeled by complex variables @xmath217 and a final state labeled by @xmath218 .",
    "suppose there is a differential operator @xmath219 acting on either the initial or the final variables which annihilates the amplitude : @xmath220 the previous equation can then be interpreted as the wheeler - dewitt equation for pure gravity satisfied by the propagation kernel in the holomorphic representation .",
    "a recent result @xcite in the context of spinfoam cosmology shows that the holomorphic amplitude for a transition between two homogeneous metrics is , in a suitable approximation , in the kernel of a differential operator which is ( the quantization of ) the friedmann - robertson - walker hamiltonian in the absence of matter .",
    "we find this result encouraging and it urges us to further explore this line of research .",
