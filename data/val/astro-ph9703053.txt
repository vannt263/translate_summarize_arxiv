    "s1040 ( catalogued by @xcite ; = fagerholm 143 ) is a yellow giant with = 0.86 , and an astrometric and radial velocity member of the open cluster m67 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in their radial velocity study of m67 ,",
    "mathieu et al .   discovered that s1040 was a single - lined spectroscopic binary with a circular orbit and a period of 42.8 days . in the m67 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , s1040 occupies a `` red straggler '' position , 0.2 mag blueward of the giant branch .",
    "janes and smith ( 1984 ) suggested that this anomalous location of s1040 in the cmd could be explained if s1040 were a photometric binary consisting of a star on the lower giant branch and a star near the main - sequence turnoff .",
    "however , mathieu et al .  ( 1990 ) found no evidence of a secondary correlation peak in their high signal - to - noise spectra of s1040 , indicating that the secondary must be considerably fainter than the primary .",
    "they also pointed out that the mass function was consistent with a secondary mass as low as 0.18 m@xmath3 .",
    "to explain the circularization of the orbit , verbunt and phinney ( 1995 ) suggested that the secondary of s1040 was a white dwarf , and that the white dwarf progenitor must have filled its roche lobe .",
    "an important clue to the nature of the s1040 secondary was provided by a 1620   image of m67 obtained in 1995 march with the _ ultraviolet imaging telescope _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "a total of 16 stars in m67 were detected at 1620  , including the 11 hottest blue stragglers , four white dwarf candidates , and s1040 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the detection of s1040 at 1620   almost certainly implies that the secondary is a hot white dwarf , since a more luminous type of ultraviolet source would be inconsistent with the composite red b  v color .",
    "since a white dwarf secondary makes a negligible contribution to the integrated v magnitude , the peculiar location of s1040 in the m67 cmd is likely the result of an earlier mass - transfer episode . to further elucidate the nature of s1040",
    ", we have now obtained observations of s1040 with the goddard high - resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) and the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) aboard the _ hubble space telescope_.    the spectroscopic determination of the fundamental parameters of a post - mass - transfer binary is often problematic , because both components have deviated from single star evolution .",
    "thus the membership of s1040 in the well - studied solar - metallicity open cluster m67 is particularly fortunate , and we adopt in this _ letter _ the cluster distance ( 820 pc ) , age ( 4 gyr ) , and reddening ( e(b  v ) = 0.025 ) given by carraro et al .",
    "s1040 was observed on 18 may 1996 with the g140l mode of the ghrs , covering the wavelength region from 1175   to 1450  , and with the g270h mode of the fos , covering the region from 2220   to 3300  .",
    "the observation date corresponds to phase 0.54 in the mathieu et al .",
    "( 1990 ) orbit .",
    "the exposure time of the ghrs observation was 6582s , and the use of the large ( @xmath5 ) aperture gave a spectral resolution of about 0.8  .",
    "the exposure time of the fos observation was 300s , and the use of the large ( @xmath6 ) aperture gave a spectral resolution of about 2.0  .",
    "spectra from both instruments were reduced using the software prepared by the ghrs instrument team ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ghrs spectrum was further corrected for a @xmath7% sensitivity degradation below 1200   ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ghrs spectrum of s1040 ( figure 1 ) shows a broad  absorption that confirms the identification of the s1040 secondary as a hot white dwarf .",
    "s1040 is among the faintest white dwarfs ever observed in the ultraviolet , and so despite the deep ghrs exposure , the s / n per resolution element is only about 18 .",
    "the strong emission in the core of  is due to the earth s geocorona , and the strength and spectral profile of the emission feature near 1304    is also consistent with being entirely due to diffuse gecoronal emission .",
    "interstellar lines of @xmath81260 , @xmath81335 , @xmath81302 , and @xmath81304 are clearly present , while other possible absorption features at @xmath81180 , @xmath81329 , and @xmath81371 are of uncertain origin .",
    "the s / n and spectral resolution of the ghrs spectrum is insufficient to determine whether narrow photospheric lines exist in the white dwarf spectrum , such as would be needed for an eventual determination of a double - lined spectroscopic orbit .",
    "we fit the ghrs spectrum using the pure - hydrogen white dwarf model atmospheres of bergeron et al .",
    "a low - dispersion ultraviolet spectrum is not sufficient by itself to constrain both t@xmath0  and @xmath1  in a hot white dwarf , because a good fit is possible at any value of @xmath1(@xcite ) .",
    "however , for an assumed value of @xmath1 , the best - fit value of t@xmath0  and the angular diameter derived from the flux scaling can be used along with a ( t@xmath0-dependent ) theoretical mass - radius relation to derive the white dwarf distance .",
    "table 1 shows the computed distances to s1040 for a range of assumed @xmath1  values , using the mass - radius relation of wood ( 1995 ) for carbon white dwarfs with thick hydrogen and helium layers . even for the lowest mass ( 0.2 m@xmath3 ) carbon model available , the computed distance is less than the cluster distance of 820 pc .",
    "qualitatively , the origin of this low mass determination is that a relatively cool t@xmath0  is required to fit the broad  absorption profile , so that a large radius ( low mass ) is needed to reproduce the absolute ultraviolet flux level .",
    "in fact , the use of a carbon composition to compute a mass - radius relation is not realistic for a such a low - mass white dwarf , because the ignition of helium requires a core mass of at least 0.49 m@xmath3 near the tip of the red giant branch ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . at high ( @xmath4 50,000 k ) temperatures ,",
    "a helium white dwarf is known to have a significantly larger radius than a carbon white dwarf of the same mass ( @xcite ) , and some modifications in the mass - radius relation might still be expected at the relevant t@xmath0   ( @xmath416,000 k ) for s1040 .",
    "therefore , we have recomputed the derived distances in table 1 , using new evolutionary calculations of the helium - rich core of a giant star whose envelope has been stripped ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the m67 distance of 820 pc can then be matched using a model with t@xmath0  = 16,160 k , @xmath1  = 6.7 , and a mass of @xmath9 m@xmath3 .",
    "the evolutionary time for the white dwarf to reach this t@xmath0  is about 75 myr after ejection of the envelope on the giant branch .",
    "note that , whereas the evolutionary track of a typical 0.6 m@xmath3  white dwarf crosses into the hottest ( @xmath10 k ) region of the hr diagram , the maximum t@xmath0  along the 0.22 m@xmath3  evolutionary track is only about 17,500 k.    the fos spectrum of s1040 is shown in figure 2 , along with the model white dwarf spectrum derived from the fit of the ghrs spectrum .",
    "the white dwarf still dominates the spectrum at 2200  , but provides only about 1% of the total flux at 3300  .",
    "also shown in figure 2 is a best - fit kurucz ( 1993 ) model with [ fe / h ] = 0.0 , t@xmath0  = 5150 k and @xmath1  = 3.5 , normalized to the reddening - corrected v magnitude of s1040 .",
    "the scaling required to fit the kurucz model yields a radius of the yellow giant of 5.1 r@xmath3 .",
    "a radius about five times larger than this value would be needed for s1040 to show an eclipse of the white dwarf , assuming the mathieu et al .",
    "mass function , and masses of 1.5 m@xmath3  and 0.22 m@xmath3for the primary and secondary .",
    "figure 2 also shows that the @xmath82800 doublet is observed in emission , with an reddening - corrected integrated flux of @xmath11 erg @xmath12 s@xmath13 .",
    "this corresponds to a surface flux of @xmath14 erg @xmath12 s@xmath13 , using the angular diameter derived above .",
    "this  surface flux is an order of magnitude larger than the typical values reported for seven m67 giants by dupree , hartman , & smith ( 1990 ) , and near the upper envelope of the surface flux values observed in field g giants .",
    "the high chromospheric activity level indicated by this  surface flux value , supports the classification of s1040 as an rs cvn binary , as originally suggested on the basis of its x - ray luminosity by belloni et al .",
    "( 1993 ) .",
    "table 2 summarizes the parameters of s1040 , as derived in this work and taken from the literature .",
    "the relatively long orbital period of s1040 , and the low mass derived here for the white dwarf secondary , place strong constraints on the possible evolutionary history of s1040 .",
    "an episode of mass transfer must have occured before the white dwarf progenitor developed a core mass which is larger than the mass of the current white dwarf .",
    "but if the mass transfer episode began while the donor still had a radiative envelope , then a common envelope would likely occur , leading to a shrinkage of the orbit , in contradiction to the observed 42.8d period .",
    "in fact , population synthesis calculations ( @xcite ) indicate it should not be rare for mass - transfer during the subgiant or lower giant branch of the primary ( early case b evolution ) to lead to systems similar to s1040 . for such systems ,",
    "a relation between the final orbital period and the mass of the helium white dwarf can be derived by combining the core mass  radius relation for a red giant with the requirement that the red giant always fill its roche lobe during the mass - transfer phase ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the rappaport et al .",
    "relation predicts a white dwarf mass of @xmath15 m@xmath3for the s1040 orbital period , while a similar formula of eggleton ( personal communication ) predicts a white dwarf mass of 0.25 m@xmath3 .",
    "these predicted masses are sufficiently close to the white dwarf mass of 0.224 m@xmath3  derived here , to lend confidence in our ability to outline the evolutionary history of s1040 .",
    "the basic scenario is that two stars in a relatively close orbit begin an epoch of mass transfer when the more massive star fills its roche lobe .",
    "if the initial orbital period is on the order of days , the donor star will have a helium core mass near or slightly larger than @xmath16 when mass transfer begins . until sometime after the masses equalize",
    ", the mass transfer rate will be fairly high , governed by the the donor s attempts to re - establish thermal equilibrium as it expands , while its roche lobe either shrinks or remains close to a fixed volume .",
    "after mass equalization , continued mass transfer tends to expand the roche lobe , even as the donor itself expands , leading to an epoch of stable mass transfer .",
    "the mass transfer rate during this latter epoch is governed by the donor s nuclear evolution time scale , which can be longer than it would have been had the donor mass remained constant .",
    "mass transfer ends when the donor s envelope is depleted , leaving the white dwarf remnant we observe .    for concreteness",
    ", we have constructed a binary evolution model which yields a system with the approximate parameters derived here for s1040 .",
    "the final white dwarf mass ( 0.25 m@xmath3 ) and age ( 5.0 gyr ) in the model are slightly larger than values reported here for s1040 , but probably within the observational errors .",
    "the model ingredients are described by di stefano & nelson ( 1996 ) and di stefano ( 1997 ) , and we note here only that the mass retention factor , @xmath17 , is taken to be proportional to the ratio of the donor s thermal time scale to that of the accretor .",
    "the initial model masses are 1.24 and 0.82 m@xmath3 , and the initial orbital period is 1.86d .",
    "for such a system , roche lobe overflow occurs after about 4.1 gyr , when the more massive star has developed a core mass of 0.159 m@xmath3 .",
    "after 95 myr , the component masses have equalized at about 0.98 m@xmath3(with about 0.1 m@xmath3  lost from the system ) , although the orbital period ( 1.97d ) , and the donor core mass ( 0.163 m@xmath3 ) , have increased only slightly .",
    "stable mass transfer continues for another 765 myr until the envelope of the donor is depleted , leaving a system with an orbital period of 42.1 d , consisting of a 0.25 m@xmath3  helium white dwarf and a 1.48 m@xmath3   blue straggler .",
    "in fact , the star is observed as a blue straggler ( i.e.  the accretor mass exceeds the cluster turnoff mass ) during the final @xmath18 myr of mass transfer .",
    "as noted earlier , comparison with the 0.22 m@xmath3evolutionary track indicates that mass transfer in s1040 ended about 75 myr ago .",
    "thus , within the past 75 myr the blue straggler in s1040 must have evolved redward to its current location , 0.2 mag blueward of the giant branch in the m67 cmd .",
    "qualitatively , an evolved blue straggler is expected to lie to the blue of the cluster giant branch , but a more detailed calculation than presented in this _",
    "letter _ will be needed to follow the temperature and luminosity evolution of the accretor .    are there other systems similar to s1040 ?",
    "case b mass transfer is the most likely explanation for the origin of the current m67 blue straggler f190 , which has a 4.2d period , although it may not be possible to explain the other m67 blue stragglers as the end products of mass transfer ( @xcite ) . among the field stars , many of the parameters of ay cet (= hr 373 , k0 iv + wd , p = 56.8d ) are similar to those of s1040 , including the mass function and the estimated white dwarf temperature ( @xcite ) .",
    "simon et al .",
    "point out that the white dwarf mass in ay cet could be as low as 0.25 m@xmath3 , provided that its distance is near the the upper limit of that derived from the ( large ) uncertainty in its parallax .",
    "the hot component in the eclipsing binary hd 185510 ( k0 iii / iv , p = 20.7d ) is known to have a low ( 0.3 m@xmath3 ) mass , but whether its atmospheric parameters are consistent with those of a degenerate helium white dwarf is still uncertain ( @xcite ) .",
