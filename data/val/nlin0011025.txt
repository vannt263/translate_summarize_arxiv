    "it is generally surmised that microscopic chaos is a necessary condition for diffusive behavior of a system .",
    "microscopic chaos here means a positive kolmogorov - sinai ( ks ) entropy , or equivalently , at least one positive lyapunov exponent .",
    "while this seemed to be confirmed by an ingenious experiment with a brownian particle  @xcite , we showed that the same behavior on which the microscopic chaoticity of the brownian system was established also held for a manifestly nonchaotic system with zero ks entropy  @xcite , so that both systems exhibited diffusion .",
    ", a one dimensional hard rod model  @xcite and a heavy particle in a lattice of light particles  @xcite . in both cases",
    "there are an infinite number of moving particles , so we expect that the ks entropy is infinite , as in the infinite ideal gas  @xcite . here",
    "we have only one moving particle , and we argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that the ks entropy of our nonchaotic models is zero . ] in these works we used the mean square displacement ( eq .  [ e : msd ] below ) , a two time distribution function , as our definition of diffusion .",
    "an anonymous referee of a ref .",
    "@xcite , alerted us to a definition of diffusion ( eq .  [ e : multi ] ) which involved multitime distribution functions and the question arose whether those could distinguish between chaotic and nonchaotic models , in that all our chaotic models and none of our nonchaotic models would satisfy this definition . in this note",
    "we show that this behavior does not occur : no difference has been found between the diffusive behavior of microscopically chaotic and nonchaotic models even in the multitime distribution functions we studied .    our models , a subset of those of ref .",
    "@xcite , consist of a point particle moving with unit speed in two dimensions , undergoing specular reflections ( collisions ) with fixed non - overlapping scatterers .",
    "the shapes , positions , and orientations of the scatterers in the various models are defined in the next section , and can be classified as lorentz or ( modified ) ehrenfest models . for each fixed configuration of scatterers ,",
    "the particle s position @xmath0 is determined numerically as a function of the time @xmath1 for random initial positions @xmath2 ( which are uniformly distributed over the plane , except that they can not lie inside a scatterer ) and random initial velocity directions ( also uniformly distributed ) of the particle .",
    "the probabilities below are defined with respect to this distribution of initial conditions .",
    "the definition of diffusion proposed by the referee and used in this paper is stated in terms of the probability of the particle initially at the origin visiting @xmath3 regions at @xmath3 different specified times .",
    "explicitly , a system is said to be diffusive , if , for all @xmath4 , the @xmath5 time ( including @xmath6 ) probability distributions @xmath7 satisfy the relation  @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 are arbitrary times and the @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) are arbitrary subsets of the plane .",
    "@xmath12 is the gaussian green s function of the ( generally anisotropic ) diffusion equation in two dimensions , @xmath13 and determines the probability density of a displacement @xmath14 in time @xmath15 in the limit @xmath16 .",
    "the scaling of the position and time by @xmath17 is based on the fact that for gaussian diffusion the mean square displacement of the particle is proportional to the time , and is a macroscopic limit . here ,",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 are distances measured in the eigendirections of the diffusion tensor , while @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the corresponding eigenvalues . in the isotropic case @xmath22 and",
    "the choice of orthogonal directions @xmath23 is arbitrary .",

    "this expression involves the usual 2-time distribution function , that is , @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ e : multi ] ) .",
    "the mean square displacement is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where we found numerically that both chaotic and nonchaotic models exhibited gaussian diffusion .",
    "it is conceivable that a system may have gaussian 2-time distribution functions but non - gaussian multi - time distribution functions , i.e. , for larger values of @xmath3 .",
    "the results of this note show that also for larger @xmath3 , both chaotic and nonchaotic models appear diffusive within the accuracy of the numerical methods .",
    "the models we consider are the same as some of those discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . , the periodic squares rp4 and the randomly positioned squares r@xmath30",
    ". here , the l stands for the lorentz gas , r for the random orientations of the squares , p for periodic , 4 for the linear dimension of the unit cell ( there are also 4 scatterers per unit cell ) , and @xmath30 for the infinite `` unit cell '' . ] as mentioned above , they all contain a point particle colliding with fixed non - overlapping scatterers in two dimensions .",
    "the density is such that the scatterers cover exactly half of the available area .",
    "the microscopically chaotic models are lorentz models , consisting of circular scatterers distributed in position either periodically or randomly over the plane , such that they do not overlap .",
    "they are microscopically chaotic as they have a positive ks entropy .",
