    "wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars are evolved massive o  type stars which are predicted to be the progenitors of type ibc core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) . however , to date there has been no direct confirmation of the wr - sne connection .",
    "pre - sne broad - band images have failed to reveal the progenitor of @xmath010 type ib / c sne ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( smartt 2009 ) ) .",
    "wr stars can be classified into two main subtypes , nitrogen  rich ( wn ) and carbon  rich ( wc ) stars , which reveal the products of cno burning and triple alpha reactions , respectively .",
    "wr stars exhibit a unique emission line spectrum which is dominated by heii@xmath14686 emission lines for wn stars while wc spectra , which also show weaker heii@xmath14686 , are dominated by ciii@xmath14650 and civ@xmath15808 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( crowther 2007 ) ) .",
    "these strong emission lines can be 0.2 - 2.5magnitudes brighter than the adjacent continuum , making wr stars easy to detect using narrow - band imaging techniques .",
    "type ib sne are hydrogen  poor , while type ic sne are both hydrogen and helium  poor .",
    "the similarities between the observed type ib and ic sn spectra and the chemical composition of the wn and wc stars makes them strong progenitor candidates , respectively .",
    "m101 is a grand - design spiral galaxy which lies face - on at a distance of 6.2mpc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( shappee & stanek , 2011 ) ) .",
    "it has a high star - formation rate of at least @xmath04.5m@xmath2yr@xmath3 based on the h@xmath4 flux or @xmath06.8m@xmath2yr@xmath3 from far uv imaging ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( lee et al . 2009 ) ) .",
    "there is a wealth of hst / acs archival data for m101 which was obtained under the legacy program , however the most effective way to identify wr stars is via narrow - band imaging techniques centered on the wr emission lines .",
    "we obtained 18 pointings of m101 using wfc3/f469n over 36 orbits in cycle 17 ( pi : shara ) .",
    "identifying wr stars beyond the local group with ground - based imaging is challenging since we can only resolve them on scales of @xmath025pc .",
    "the emission lines of wr stars , although strong , can easily be diluted by strong continuum from other ob stars in the unresolved region ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( bibby & crowther 2010 ) ) .",
    "the high spatial resolution images allow us to resolve sources down to @xmath03pc , decreasing the contamination of the wr emission by continuum sources .    typically wr stars span an absolute magnitude range of m@xmath5=4 to 8mag ; however , our ground - based studies do not extend fainter than m@xmath5=5mag .",
    "the improved sensitivity of hst allows us to identify the faintest and least massive wr stars , detecting stars to m@xmath6=3.5mag and m@xmath7=4mag .",
    "the acs and wfc3 data were re - drizzled onto the same scale of 0.05 arcsec pix@xmath3 using multidrizzle .",
    "photometry was performed with the stand - alone daophot package .",
    "stars that had at least a 3 sigma excess in the f469n filter compared to the f435w and f555w filters were identified as wr candidates .",
    "these candidates were then visually inspected using the `` blinking '' method ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( moffat & shara , 1983 ) ) .",
    "four of the wfc3/f469n pointings have currently undergone analysis and have revealed 372 wr candidates with a heii @xmath14686 excess of at least 3 sigma ( fig .",
    "[ magnitudes ] ) . the brightest candidates with m(f435w)-m(f469n )",
    "excess of @xmath82.5mag are likely to be single wr stars , whereas the fainter candidates at m(f469n)@xmath025mag with small m(f435w)-m(f469n ) excesses @xmath80.6mag are more likely to host multiple wr stars in unresolved clusters .    from the photometric analysis we were also able to identify sources in the f469n image that were not identified in either the f435w or f555w images .",
    "this is indicative of a faint wr star with a continuum which lies below the detection threshold of the broad - band images .",
    "we identified an additional 269 wr candidates that were only detected in the narrow - band images , which were again checked using the blinking method ( fig.[blink ] ) .",
    "we are currently awaiting execution of follow - up multi - object spectroscopy with gemini - north / gmos for a sample of these candidates ( @xmath035% ) which will allow us to ( i ) determine the multiplicity of the sources , ( ii ) assign a spectral classification of wn or wc to the candidate and ( iii ) infer the subtype of the remaining candidates for which we did not obtain spectroscopic confirmation .",
    "we identified 641 wr candidates within four hst / wfc3 pointing of m101 , 42% of which are _ only _ detected in the narrow - band image .",
    "this is much higher than the 25% found from ground - based studies of other nearby spiral galaxies , e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bibby & crowther ( 2012 ) ) , which is most likely due to the improved sensitivity and spatial resolution of hst which allows us to detect fainter wr stars .",
    "this work highlights the effectiveness of high , spatial resolution narrow - band observations in detecting wr stars .",
    "if we hope to confirm or , equally important , rule out wr stars as the progenitors of type ib / c sne , then we require a _ complete _ sample of wr stars in several nearby galaxies .",
    "\\(i ) investigate how the number of wr stars varies with the number of o stars and red supergiants ( rsg ) across the galaxy as a function of metallicity and compare the results to predictions from theoretical evolutionary models .",
    "\\(iv ) expand our existing catalogue of wr stars which can then be referred to in the event that a type ib / c sne occurs in one of these galaxies .",
    "this will allow strong , direct observational evidence for , or against , the wr - sne connection ."
