    "top quark physics is an important part of the research program at the lhc . since its discovery in proton - antiproton collisions at the tevatron collider ,",
    "the properties of the top quark have been studied in detail ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . with the advent of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , top - quark processes can be studied for the first time in multi - tev collisions .    due to its large mass  @xcite",
    ", the top quark may play a special role in the standard model .",
    "the top quark decays rapidly , long before having the chance to form a bound state hadron .",
    "hence , it allows direct access to measurements of its mass , spin , charge and other properties .",
    "additionally , since the higgs boson of the standard model couples to fermions in strength proportional to the fermion s mass , the higgs coupling to the top quark is large . because of this",
    ", detailed study of the properties of the top quark can provide constraints on the yet - to - be observed higgs boson .",
    "further , in light of its large mass , it is hypothesized that the top quark could play a role in electroweak symmetry breaking and the generation of particle masses in alternatives to the higgs mechanism .",
    "finally , several signatures of new physics accessible at the lhc either suffer from top - quark production as a significant background or contain top quarks themselves .    at the lhc",
    ", the top quark is expected to be produced primarily via the strong interaction ( mostly via gluon - gluon fusion , in contrast to the tevatron ) in @xmath2 pairs . the next - to - leading order ( nlo )",
    "corrections to top - quark pair production at hadron colliders were calculated for unobserved spins in  @xcite and with the full top - quark spin dependence in  @xcite . only recently a complete analytic result for the nlo partonic cross section has been published  @xcite .",
    "approximations towards a full nnlo result have been obtained by various groups , e.g.  @xcite .    within the standard model , the top quark decays via the weak process @xmath3 nearly 100% of the time .",
    "subsequently top - quark pair events are categorized according to the decay of the two @xmath4 bosons .",
    "we consider here the dilepton channel , in which both w bosons decay to leptons , and the lepton+jets channel , where one w decays leptonically , while the other one decays into quarks .    in this note ,",
    "the first results  @xcite on top quark physics obtained with the initial 7 tev lhc data are presented .",
    "previous simulation studies for both channels can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the selected sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity  @xcite of @xmath5 , using data recorded by cms  @xcite up to august 2010 . before being used in the analysis ,",
    "data events are constrained to periods in which the cms detector was fully operational .",
    "additionally , events are vetoed if they are identified as resulting from beam halo interactions or from beam scraping .",
    "finally , events are required to possess at least one well - constructed primary vertex within @xmath615  cm .",
    "simulated samples of top - quark pair production events are made using the madgraph event generator  @xcite , subsequently processed with pythia  @xcite , and then processed with a full cms detector simulation based on geant4  @xcite .",
    "events are generated with up to four additional hard partons .",
    "various background samples were produced .",
    "madgraph is used for @xmath7/@xmath8/@xmath9+jets production and single top .",
    "leptonic tau decays are included in the drell - yan samples .",
    "pythia is used to generate qcd events used in the study of the multijet backgrounds .",
    "the top - quark pair production simulation has been normalized using a nlo cross section of @xmath10 , obtained using mcfm  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in the cross section includes the scale uncertainties , determined by varying the factorization and renormalization scales by a factor 2 and 0.5 around the central scale choice of @xmath11 , and the uncertainties from the parton distribution functions and the value of the strong coupling @xmath12 .",
    "similarly , the simulations of @xmath7/@xmath8/@xmath9+jets production and single top production have been normalized using available inclusive n(n)lo cross section calculations .",
    "dilepton events in the dielectron ( @xmath13 ) , dimuon ( @xmath14 ) and electron - muon ( @xmath15 ) modes are considered .",
    "events passing a single muon or electron trigger are selected which contain two oppositely charged , high transverse momentum @xmath16 leptons with @xmath17 and pseudorapidity @xmath18 for muons ( electrons ) .",
    "muons reconstructed  @xcite with high quality are selected , whereas identification based on cluster shape properties and track - cluster matching criteria is applied to electrons  @xcite , and electron candidates consistent with photon conversions are rejected .",
    "leptons are required to be isolated within a cone of @xmath19 , using a relative isolation variable which employs sums of track transverse momenta and calorimeter transverse energy deposits , scaled to the lepton @xmath16 .",
    "both leptons are required to be consistent with originating from the primary hard interaction , both in the transverse plane as well as along the beam direction . for @xmath13 and @xmath14 candidates ,",
    "the dilepton invariant mass is required to satisfy @xmath20 , to reject z events . missing transverse energy ( met )  @xcite",
    "is calculated from calorimeter signals , made more accurate by applying a track - based correction for the inexact calorimeter response .",

    "distributions for a relaxed event selection ( without jets+met requirements , no z veto applied ) are shown in figure  [ fig : dil - relaxed ] .",
    "good agreement is observed between data and simulation , scaled to the integrated luminosity of the data .         for several sources of backgrounds ,",
    "data - driven estimation techniques are tested .",
    "drell - yan events passing the z veto are estimated by counting events rejected by this veto , scaled by the ratio of events outside and inside the veto region , obtained from simulation .",
    "the estimated systematic uncertainty of the method is @xmath30 .",
    "background from events with non - genuine isolated leptons ( i.e. not originating from w / z decays ) is estimated by weighting events passing loose lepton identification with a tight - to - loose ratio which is parameterized in @xmath16 and @xmath25 , measured in an inclusive qcd sample .",
    "the method is used to estimate the contributions from qcd multi - jet and w+jets events , containing two and one non - genuine lepton respectively , with a @xmath30 systematic uncertainty per lepton .",
    "the data - driven estimates are in reasonable agreement with expectations from simulation .    applying the full event selection , including z - veto , met requirement and requesting at least two jets , there are four events selected in the sample . the expected non - top background from simulation is less than 0.3 events , while 2.1 top signal events are expected .",
    "figure  [ fig : dil - full ] shows the b - jet multiplicity distribution using a b - tagging algorithm  @xcite based on the impact parameter significances of the tracks associated with the jets . a loose working point with @xmath31 b - jet efficiency and @xmath32 mistagging rate in qcd events",

    "this may be explained by the different sources of background contributing in @xmath34+jets ( muons from semi - leptonic @xmath41-decays and decays - in - flight ) and @xmath33+jets ( mostly photon conversions ) , respectively .",
    "several methods are studied which allow a data - driven estimate of the amount of qcd background in the selected sample . in both @xmath33+jets and @xmath34+jets ,",
    "a method based on the relative isolation variable is employed .",
    "the isolation distribution is fitted with a suitable function in the non - isolated ( qcd dominated ) sideband region , which is then extrapolated into the isolated signal region .",
    "another method , often referred to as _ abcd method _",
    ", exploits two nearly uncorrelated variables ( here lepton impact parameter and relative isolation ) which separate signal and qcd background in @xmath34+jets .",
    "a third method , applied in @xmath33+jets , is based on a template fit of the met or @xmath42 distribution , using a data - driven qcd template .",
    "two models are considered in order to obtain template distributions for qcd multijet events : `` background '' electrons , in which the electron candidate very nearly satisfies the selection criteria but instead is a marginal failure ; and jet - electrons , positively identified jet objects with large electromagnetic fraction , that closely resemble electron candidates . in @xmath33+jets ( @xmath34+jets ) , a 50% ( 100% ) systematic uncertainty is assigned to the qcd background , based on the data - driven estimates .",
    "+ jets events , where one of the jets has an additional muon - in - jet signature ( left ) , as well as for @xmath33+jets and @xmath34+jet combined , where at least one of the jets is b - tagged using a secondary vertex algorithm ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ] + jets events , where one of the jets has an additional muon - in - jet signature ( left ) , as well as for @xmath33+jets and @xmath34+jet combined , where at least one of the jets is b - tagged using a secondary vertex algorithm ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ]    since top quarks decay to b - quarks , one expects two b - jets to be present in every event in the case of signal , less so for the important background processes such as qcd and w+jets , which contain a mixture of light and heavy quarks . therefore , the purity of the selection can be enhanced by selecting events containing b - jets . a simple way to enrich the b - content of the sample is by requesting the presence of at least one jet which contains a muon within @xmath29 , typically originating from a semileptonic b - decay .",
    "the jet multiplicity for such a selection in @xmath34+jets is shown in figure  [ fig : ljets - btag ] . for @xmath43 ,",

    "in both the dilepton and the lepton+jets channel , events are observed in signal regions expected to be dominated by top quark pair production .",
    "the observed rates are roughly consistent with current theory expectations for top quark pair production , taking into account the experimental uncertainties due to e.g. jet energy scale , b - tagging performance , but also the theoretical uncertainties ( e.g. scale and parton distributions for top signal , heavy flavour treatment for w / z+jets backgrounds ) .",
