    "surface anchoring , the promotion of a desired liquid crystal ( lc ) orientation at a surface @xcite , remains an important problem in applications because precise tuning of anchoring parameters is often necessary for optimal device performance @xcite .",
    "patterning the surface with a spatially varying preferred orientation is an attractive route to create alignment layers with desired anchoring properties because both the _ effective _ anchoring strength and its orientation or _ easy axis _ can be altered by adjusting geometric features of the pattern @xcite .",
    "additionally , surfaces of appropriate symmetry @xcite may promote multiple stable easy axes leading to _ bistable _ devices @xcite .",
    "bistability is desirable @xcite both for reduced power consumption and improved addressing of hi - resolution displays . beyond displays , patterned lc systems are promising candidates as biosensors @xcite and photonic devices @xcite .",
    "many methods exist to achieve patterning , encompassing both topographical and chemical approaches .",
    "these include mechanical rubbing @xcite , photolithography @xcite , scribing with an atomic force microscope ( afm ) @xcite , microcontact printing of self - assembled monolayers ( sams ) @xcite , and topographic surface features @xcite .",
    "since mechanical methods , such as rubbing , result in unwanted scratches or debris on the surface @xcite , and many methods do not scale well to high - volume manufacturing @xcite , sams have received much attention in recent years .",
    "certain experimental methods show control over the azimuthal director angle as well as the polar anchoring angle @xcite - this is the focus of the work presented in this paper .",
    "striped surfaces , incorporating alternating regions preferring planar and vertical alignment , have been well studied @xcite . for this pattern ,",
    "the polar angle of the bulk lc is controlled by the average polar easy axis on the surface ; the azimuthal alignment has an energy minimum aligned parallel or perpendicular to the stripe orientation , depending on the ratio of the elastic constants @xcite .",
    "square checkerboard lattices are more complicated : an anchoring transition occurs in which the liquid crystal aligns with the lattice vectors for relatively strong surface anchoring , but switches to the diagonal for very weak anchoring @xcite .",
    "finally , both polar and azimuthal control over the bulk lc director orientation may be achieved with a rectangular checkerboard lattice . in this arrangement , certain rectangle ratios and anchoring strengths",
    "combine to shift the preferred director azimuthal angle from alignment with a rectangle edge to alignment diagonally across the rectangle @xcite .    for substrates constructed from squares or rectangles",
    ", the pattern element determines the symmetry and periodicity of the patterning .",
    "it is , however , straightforward to break this coupling by resorting to non - space - filling pattern basis motifs , such as circles or ellipses , and arranging these on a periodic lattice .",
    "importantly , this approach provides a systematic approach by which to introduce the additional parameters needed to achieve truly independent control of polar and azimuthal anchoring angles and , so , set these at arbitrary target values .    in this paper , we use a continuum approach to determine the ground state of a liquid crystal in contact with a surface formed of a square lattice of circular or elliptical motifs .",
    "from this , we identify scenarios for which the basis symmetry and the lattice symmetry may favor different alignments .",
    "this yields bistable configurations which are free from the constraints that pertain for square or rectangular motifs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : monte carlo simulation results with circle patterns are presented in section [ sec : simulations ] . in section [ sec : continuum - model ] , an analytical continuum model is constructed for this arrangement with the simplifying assumption that the director lies at a constant azimuthal angle .",

    "the strongest of these regions is the thin brown section at @xmath78 , the largest possible circle radius .",
    "this region of parameter space is dominated by the surface term , likely due to the inability of vertically / horizontally aligned lcs to effectively fill space between two abutting circles whose edges are nearly perpendicular to the lc director . for circles much smaller than @xmath91 , the preference becomes very weak indeed .",
    "the comparable magnitude and conflicting preferences of the bulk and surface energies at these length scales suggests that the constant-@xmath21 approximation may be too restrictive for this system . unlike the rectangular and square patterns previously considered ,",
    "the alignment direction is promoted exclusively by the lattice while the basis favors no particular alignment .",
    "the results of the monte carlo simulations also suggest this : in the configurations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshots](b ) , the particles tend to align tangentially around the edge of the circle because for @xmath92 the energetically cheapest way to achieve the vertical - to - planar transition around the perimeter of the circle is through a twist deformation . in section [ sub : numerical - model ] , therefore , we numerically minimize the free energy ( [ eq : frank ] ) with respect to a completely arbitrary director profile to quantify the effect of azimuthal variations .",
    "we now consider elliptical patterns . for long ellipses",
    ", one might expect the effective azimuthal alignment to lie parallel to the semi - major axis , resembling the situation with alignment on striped surfaces@xcite .",
    "hence , by adjusting @xmath21 , it should be possible to control the preferred azimuthal angle arbitrarily and , by tuning the aspect ratio , also control the effective azimuthal anchoring energy . the control parameter space to consider",
    "is greatly expanded : while the cell depth @xmath79 and the anchoring potential @xmath77 remain parameters , the circle radius @xmath80 is replaced by the semi major axis length @xmath93 , aspect ratio @xmath94 , and the alignment angle @xmath28 . from the structure of the solution ( [ eq : theta ] ) , we expect the cell depth and anchoring potential to have similar effects in both patterns and so we focus on the effects of the new parameters in this section .    total lc energy as a function of the azimuthal angle shown for ( a ) several ellipse rotation angles with @xmath95 and ( b ) for several different aspect ratios with @xmath96 .",
    "both panels have @xmath17 , @xmath87 , and a coverage fraction equal to that of a circle with @xmath97 .",
    "rotation of the ellipse results in migration of the preferred azimuthal angle from alignment with the axes of the unit cell to alignment with the semi major axis of the ellipse .",
    "however , panel ( b ) shows that this transition in azimuthal angle preference is not immediate , but instead passes through several smaller angles as aspect ratio increases . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ellipserotate ] , we show effective azimuthal anchoring profiles @xmath98 calculated for a variety of values of @xmath28 and @xmath94 .",
    "the coverage fraction of the pattern , or equivalently the area of the elliptical motif , is kept constant in order to fix the effective polar angle .",
    "an immediately obvious feature , compared to the equivalent profiles for circular patterns plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : eprofile ] , is that the mirror symmetry of the pattern about @xmath99 is entirely broken , leaving behind a non - symmetric anchoring potential reminiscent of the structures fabricated in @xcite .    for fairly modest aspect ratios , the alignment angle of the ellipse controls the preferred azimuthal angle such that the energy minima occur at @xmath100 . for smaller values of @xmath28 , or aspect ratios close to unity , the results are more complex : for instance , the energy minimum for @xmath101 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ellipserotate](a ) occurs at @xmath102 instead of @xmath103 . also , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ellipserotate](b ) we see that , for a rotation angle of @xmath104 , the azimuthal preference moves from alignment with the sides of the unit cell to alignment with the semi major axis of the ellipse gradually , preferring @xmath102 for an aspect ratio of 1.05 and @xmath103 for an aspect ratio of 1.1 .",
    "the mechanism for this transition is two - fold .",
    "firstly , the surface energy consistently prefers azimuthal alignment along the semi - major axis of the ellipse .",
    "though the angle preferred by the surface remains the same for any non - unit aspect ratio , the strength of the preference grows with increasing aspect ratio .",
    "second , as the aspect ratio grows , the bulk energy of the lc tends to prefer an azimuthal angle aligned with the ellipse alignment angle , but this move happens slowly such that small - to - moderate aspect ratios result in a preferred angle somewhere between @xmath83 and @xmath100 .",
    "the magnitude of the bulk energy preference also grows with increasing aspect ratio , but less dramatically than that of the surface energy preference .",
    "the preferred angle @xmath105 is therefore the result of a tension between surface and bulk effects .",
    "we display the direction and strength of the effective anchoring potential as a function of aspect ratio in fig .",
    "[ fig : ellipsephasediagram](a ) . fig .",
    "[ fig : ellipsephasediagram](b ) presents a phase diagram for preferred angle as a function of the semi - major axis and aspect ratio of the elliptical motifs while holding ellipse rotation angle , cell depth , and anchoring potential constant . as expected , increasing aspect ratio leads to alignment of the effective easy axis with the ellipse long axis .",
    "less intuitive is the fact that smaller ellipses transition from alignment with the lattice to alignment with the basis at lower aspect ratios .",
    "the decreased scale of the bulk lc energy for small surface features drives this as unit cells with small motifs have surface and bulk energies at the same scale .",
    "thus , increases in aspect ratio quickly shift the lc azimuthal preference to align with the basis , overcoming the influence of the bulk .      as briefly discussed earlier , the monte carlo simulations produced configurations in which the particles tended to align tangentially with the boundary of the circle pattern .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3dtangent ] and , together with the results of the previous sections , suggest that the constant @xmath21 approximation may be too restrictive for this system .",
    "we therefore performed a numerical minimization of the frank energy ( [ eq : frank ] ) again using the two - constant approximation but now allowing the director to vary arbitrarily in 3d .",
    "a cartesian representation of the director @xmath106 was used and the unit length constraint @xmath107 enforced locally .",
    "the energy was discretized using second - order finite differences and minimized using an adaptive gradient - descent relaxation method with line searches . to improve convergence ,",
    "successive refinement was used : an initial guess is relaxed on a coarse grid , then interpolated and relaxed onto successively finer grids . at each step , the system was relaxed until the energy converged .",
    "( a ) results from 3d director minimization model .",
    "shown is the director orientation on the bottom face of the unit cell for planar circle patterns of radius @xmath78 , @xmath97 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 .",
    "these simulations are performed with @xmath110 , @xmath111 , a final grid size of @xmath112 , and an initial guess that had the director aligned along the @xmath9-axis .",
    "( b ) corresponding results from monte carlo simulations . ]    results from the relaxation model for a set of planar patterned surfaces are shown in fig . [ fig:3dtangent](a ) .",
    "an initial guess with the director aligned along the @xmath9-axis was used .",
    "after relaxation , the director adopts an orientation tangent to the pattern edges , as seen in the corresponding monte carlo simulations , fig . [ fig:3dtangent](b ) .",
    "the tangential alignment arises because it corresponds to a twist deformation across the vertical planar boundary , which is energetically cheaper than a bend or splay deformation .",
    "the behavior breaks down for smaller circle radii because the bend deformation required to follow the arc of the feature becomes too energetically expensive .",
    "this paper has considered the alignment behavior of square arrays decorated with elliptical motifs , demonstrating that such patterns can be used to create surfaces with controllable anchoring energy and easy axis by varying the period of the pattern , ellipse orientation , aspect ratio , and coverage fraction .",
    "given the two - constant approximation and the assumption of a constant azimuthal angle , the director configuration and energy can be computed analytically .",
    "depending on the circle radius , cell depth , and polar anchoring strength of the alignment material , the ground state may have azimuthal alignment along either of the lattice vectors , or diagonally .",
    "our study offers invaluable advice for applications because , while the elliptical patterned surface offers a remarkable degree of control over the anchoring properties , the design parameter space for the pattern is large .",
    "briefly , surfaces patterned by rotated ellipses allow control of the azimuthal angle over a continuum of values between the lattice vectors and the diagonal depending on the orientation of the ellipse . in these cases , the ellipse aspect ratio controls the effective anchoring energy .",
    "the behavior is nontrivial , however , and includes regions of bistability , as well as an azimuthal anchoring transition for some designs .    unlike for other patterned surfaces previously studied ,",
    "the constant azimuthal angle approximation is of only limited use .",
    "a numerical study showed a preference for tangential alignment along the vertical - planar boundary of the pattern in excellent agreement with monte carlo simulations .    while the present study has considered a flat surface , the results may also be important for experimentalists using arrays of posts to align liquid crystals as has been reported in @xcite .",
    "it seems that only a very modest amount of anisotropy in the shape of the pillars , for example using posts of elliptical cross section , may break the square symmetry and lead to significantly better azimuthal alignment if desired .    _",
