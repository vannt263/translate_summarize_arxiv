    "defined as @xmath15 . in this context , it is called _ ruelle pressure _ or _",
    "topological pressure_. it contains information about the dynamics of the system , which can be extracted again by varying the control parameter @xmath7 .",
    "for example , for an open system , the escape rate @xmath16 is such that @xmath17 , and @xmath0 vanishes when @xmath7 is equal to the fractal dimension of the repeller ( set of trajectories which never escape )",
    ".    it has already been found in a more general frame that some non analyticity of the ruelle pressure may occur at certain @xmath7 values @xcite .",
    "they are called phase transitions in analogy with thermodynamics .    in this paper , we study the influence of disorder on the structure of the ruelle pressure .",
    "we have applied the thermodynamic formalism to systems with static disorder and have found very peculiar features @xcite . in the limit of infinite systems , and for almost all @xmath7 values , the ruelle pressure becomes completely determined by trajectories localized on rare fluctuations of the disorder .",
    "the global structure of the disorder in particular the density of impurities becomes irrelevant .",
    "depending on @xmath7 , the relevant trajectories are not always localized onto the same type of fluctuations .",
    "the crossovers between the different localization regimes are characterized by non - analytical points in the ruelle pressure .    for finite but large systems ,",

    "the name lorentz lattice gas is used when the light particle is , for reasons of simplicity , constrained to move on a ( cubic ) lattice , with scatterers located at the nodes or sites .",
    "the localization processes occurring when the thermodynamic formalism is applied to such a system , have already been discussed in an extensive theoretical analysis @xcite .",
    "the present paper contains the numerical counterpart and demonstrates the validity of our analytical results .",
    "it clarifies the mechanism of localization in large systems by explicitly calculating the topological pressure for specific non - random configurations in section [ sect_special ] . in section [ sect_dh ] an exact expression for the hausdorff dimension of the repeller is obtained for an open llg .",
    "moreover , numerical studies allow us to find a good estimate for the ruelle pressure for large but finite systems . as an intermediate result ,",
    "the distribution for the largest cluster of scatterers in random configurations ( section [ sect_largestsize ] ) is estimated theoretically , and measured through numerical simulations .",
    "first we give a more precise definition of our model . a number of @xmath18 fixed scatterers are randomly placed with a probability @xmath19 on the @xmath20 sites of a finite one - dimensional lattice @xmath21 , having either periodic or absorbing boundaries .",

    "a light particle , moving on the lattice , is specified at time @xmath11 ( @xmath26 ) by a state @xmath27 , where its position @xmath24 is a site on the lattice and its velocity , @xmath28 , connects site @xmath29 to one of its nearest neighbors .",
    "let @xmath30 be the probability to find the moving particle in state @xmath31 .",
    "the time evolution of the particle from time @xmath11 to @xmath32 consists of a possible collision followed by propagation .",
    "the collision is defined by the following rules : if there is no scatterer at @xmath29 , then the particle moves ballistically , i.e. @xmath33 .",
    "this is expressed in terms of @xmath34 as : @xmath35 if there is a scatterer at @xmath29 , i.e. if @xmath36 , then the velocity of the particle is reversed with probability @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) or left unchanged with probability @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , with @xmath41 . in the propagation",
    "step the particle moves over one lattice distance in the direction of its post - collision velocity , i.e. @xmath42 .",

    "indeed , the sum over @xmath61 excludes states where the particle has escaped from the domain @xmath21 .",

    "the special case @xmath62 is called a persistent random walk ( prw ) where @xmath63 and @xmath64 for all @xmath24 .",
    "then the moving particle simply undergoes a random walk with correlated jumps .    for later analysis",

    "the other trajectories traveling throughout the system may as well be omitted .",
    "thus the ruelle pressure in large systems will not reflect the global structure of the system but only characterize the largest cluster present in the configuration .",

    "this means that there is already a large degree of _ localization _ in configurations ( a)(c ) and , to a lesser extent , in ( d ) but not in ( e) , in spite of the small system size @xmath289 and number @xmath301 of scatterers .    on the other hand , if there is no large cluster ( as in configuration ( e ) , where @xmath302 ) , then @xmath292 is not a good estimate at all .",

    "if @xmath308 , the competition between the two effects may eventually promote some intermediate configurations . as an illustration , we will consider the configuration of figure [ figvoid ] : the whole lattice is solidly filled with scatterers except in the low density region of size @xmath136 . in this region , @xmath310 isolated scatterers are placed at equal distance from each other .",
    "we will compare the weights of a trajectory @xmath311 undergoing only free propagation and back  scattering , i.e. confined in a void in a strict sense between two isolated scatterers ; and a trajectory @xmath312 going through the @xmath310 isolated scatterers and thus exploring the entire low density region of size @xmath136 .    during @xmath11 time steps",

    "we conclude this paper with a number of remarks :    \\1 ) we have shown that the ruelle pressure of lorentz lattice gases in the limit of infinite systems is completely determined by rare fluctuations in the configuration of scatterers .",
    "thus it carries no information on the global structure of the disorder .",
    "numerical studies allowed us to show that this also holds for finite but large systems , for all but a small range of @xmath7 values .",

    "as already discussed in @xcite , these results can be immediately generalized to a whole class of diffusive systems with static disorder .",
    "the special case of a continuous lorentz gas has been briefly considered in @xcite .",
    "localization phenomena in fact appear very often in physics , as soon as there is some competition between energetically favorable configurations and entropic effects .",
    "some localization effects were already shown in the framework of the thermodynamic formalism for deterministic maps @xcite or multifractals @xcite . however , it is the first time that such effects are evidenced in hard spheres systems as resulting from the quenched disorder .",

    "whole_. in the same way , in a power spectrum , only some of the points may receive an individual interpretation , but the whole structure of the spectrum is interesting .",
    "an open question is to know if enough information has been kept in the region around @xmath125 where delocalization does _ not _ occur , in order to be able for example to reconstruct the structure of the disorder from it . to this respect",
    ", it would be interesting to rescale the region around @xmath125 as the system size increases , in order to prevent it from shrinking to zero in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the scaling of this region with the system size has been estimated in @xcite .",
    "when localization occurs , the information contained in the ruelle pressure concerns the properties of individual scatterers .",
    "more precisely , the knowledge of the @xmath7 regions in which one given type of scatterers will dominate yields a measure of what could be called the isotropy of the different scatterers .",
