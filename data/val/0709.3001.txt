    "new `` islands '' of superdeformation ( sd ) were found , after nearly fifteen years of systematic search , in the nuclear chart around the @xmath7 mass region ( e.g. , @xmath4ar @xcite and @xmath3ca @xcite ) .",
    "surprisingly , these light and symmetric ( i.e. , @xmath0 ) nuclei in the latest sd `` archipelago '' are magic and near - magic systems , whose ground states have spherical shape .",
    "these light nuclear systems with magic and near - magic numbers need cross - shell excitations , involving both the sd and pf shells , in order to produce collective degrees of freedom necessary for the formation of sd states .",
    "the corresponding shell - model space becomes inevitably very large .",
    "however , modern high - performance computation systems are quickly advancing to allow shell - model diagonalization to be executed if the minimum and reasonable truncations are justified in the model space .",
    "mean - field descriptions have a numerical advantage in reducing the dimension over exact diagonalization , owing to the ansatz for a many - body wave function ( for example , the slater determinant in the hartree - fock theory ) .",
    "the mean - field approach was exclusively applied @xcite to the early studies of sd states known before 2000 @xcite , such as in the @xmath8 ( e.g. , @xmath9zr@xmath10 @xcite ) , @xmath11 ( e.g. , @xmath12dy@xmath13 @xcite ) , and @xmath14 ( e.g. , @xmath15hg@xmath16 @xcite ) mass regions .",
    "the main reason is that nuclei in these sd archipelagoes belong to heavy- and medium - weight classes .",
    "they are still out of reach of the shell - model diagonalization approach using the full model space in the relevant valence shells .",
    "the mean - field method has other advantages , particularly related to intuitive understanding of many - body systems , such as nuclear deformation and nuclear superconductivity . at present , it is true to say that neither mean - field calculations nor truncated shell - model diagonalizations are dominantly superior to their counterpart .",
    "they are complementary at the moment .",
    "many theoretical studies using these two approaches followed after the experimental reports were published on @xmath4ar and @xmath3ca .",
    "shell - model diagonalizations were performed by caurier et al .",
    "@xcite and poves @xcite , with the removal of the d@xmath6 orbital from the sd - pf shells and with the corresponding effective interaction .",
    "recently , they attempted to give a consistent description of the sd and normal deformed states in @xmath3ca @xcite .",
    "these calculations with the truncation were very successful in reproducing the experimental energy spectra .",
    "the first attempt through the mean - field approach was carried out with the cranked nilsson model in the original paper @xcite . in the @xmath3ca paper @xcite , the cranked rmf ( relativistic mean field )",
    "method was applied .",
    "both of the methods ignored the pairing correlation , so that the energy spectra of the low - spin members ( @xmath17 ) in the sd bands were not well reproduced .",
    "long and sun then applied the projected shell model ( psm ) . in this model ,",
    "basis are produced through angular momentum projection onto the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) states , obtained with the p@xmath1q@xmath18q two - body interaction @xcite .",
    "a merit in this framework is that the pairing correlation is properly treated . as a consequence ,",
    "a better agreement was obtained with the experimental data .",
    "however , the calculation was restricted to an axial symmetric shape ( with the deformation parameter fixed all the way from low- to high - spin regions ) , so that the shape evolution of the system , particularly the triaxial degree of freedom in response to the coriolis force , can not be discussed in this model .",
    "variable deformation is an important degree of freedom in a rapidly rotating nucleus .",
    "for example , the band - termination phenomenon for the sd band is predicted by the cranked nilsson model , which gives a continuous evolution in triaxiality towards the non - collective oblate deformation ( @xmath19 ) in the band limit . in this study",
    "is opposite to the so - called lund convention . ]",
    "inakura et al . ,",
    "applied the cranked skyrme hartree - fock ( hf ) method , which does not restrict nuclear shape unlike the psm , but the pairing correlation was ignored @xcite .",
    "bender , flocard , and heenen analyzed the sd bands in the @xmath7 region by means of the most sophisticated method , the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) with the projected skyrme hf+bcs states @xcite .",
    "the lipkin - nogami method and particle number projection were applied , so that the pairing was properly treated .",
    "although nuclear shape can vary through the constraint on the quadrupole moment , only axial deformation was assumed in the calculation .",
    "in addition , the analyses were restricted only to low - spin states ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "this is because the states with non - zero angular momentum were only kinematically created through angular momentum projection ( without cranking ) . a dynamical effect originating from shape coexistence",
    "was considered through the gcm , but the method underestimated the more important dynamical effect coming from the coriolis force , which plays a major role at high spin .",
    "the aim of this paper is thus to test another mean field approach , which can handle the pairing correlation , the coriolis force , and the evolution of nuclear shape ( in particular , triaxiality ) in a fully self - consistent manner , for the full sd - pf model space .",
    "for this purpose , the sd bands in @xmath4ar ( a case with backbending ) and @xmath3ca ( a case without backbending ) are analyzed with the p@xmath1q@xmath18q model based on the hfb method @xcite , in this work .",
    "in the current framework , the hamiltonian contains two terms , @xmath21 the first term @xmath22 represents the one - body term and it is the spherical nilsson hamiltonian . in the second quantization notation , it is expressed as @xmath23 where a pair of operators @xmath24 denotes fermionic operators of creation and annihilation .",
    "this part is solved exactly @xmath25 and the eigenstates @xmath26 ( the spherical nilsson states ) are used as the basis in the following stages .",
    "index @xmath27 collectively denotes the quantum numbers in the nilsson model , that is , @xmath28 , as well as isospin and parity . a time - reversal state of @xmath27 is denoted as @xmath29 .",
    "we use the notation `` @xmath30 '' which means @xmath31 . in this case",
    ", its time - reversal state @xmath29 corresponds to @xmath32 .",
    "the so - called nilsson parameters for the spin - orbit and orbit - orbit forces ( denoted as @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the standard notation ) are taken from refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the second term @xmath35 represents the two - body part , and it is the p@xmath1q@xmath18q interaction in this study , @xmath36 where the first and second terms correspond to the particle - hole and particle - particle channels of the two - body interaction , respectively . the former interaction is responsible for the long - range correlation to describe nuclear deformation , while the latter is for the short - range correlation to handle the nuclear pairing .",
    "the quadrupole operator and the monopole pairing operator are respectively given as @xmath37 the hamiltonian is `` diagonalized '' with the basis @xmath38 , by means of the mean field approximation .",
    "it corresponds to a procedure to extract one - body ingredients , @xmath39 , from the two - body interaction , @xmath35 , so as to diagonalize @xmath39 .",
    "the residual part , @xmath40 , is therefore neglected in the approximation .    remembering that we take the pairing correlation into account , the hfb ansatz is employed in the variational calculations .",
    "that is , @xmath41 the quasiparticle annihilation - creation operators ( @xmath42,@xmath43 ) are related to the original annihilation - creation operators ( @xmath44 ) through the bogoliubov transformation , @xmath45 matrix elements @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the bogoliubov transformation correspond to the variational parameters in the hfb theory .",
    "the density matrix @xmath48 and the pairing tensor @xmath33 are introduced here , as @xmath49 the mean - field approximation of the hamiltonian thus reads @xmath50 the one - body component in the particle - hole ( ph ) channel , represented as @xmath51 , has the following form .",
    "@xmath52 the first term @xmath53 represents the spherical nilsson energy . the second term @xmath54",
    "is called the self - consistent potential , @xmath55 where the self - consistent coefficient @xmath56 is given as @xmath57 the coupling constant @xmath58 is determined in the standard manner by comparing to the axially deformed nilsson model with deformation @xmath59 in the beginning of the variational calculation . the one - body component in the particle - particle ( pp ) channel , denoted as @xmath60 in eq.([mf_hamiltonian ] ) , describes the pairing correlation .",
    "it has the form , @xmath61 where the pairing matrix element @xmath62 is determined from eq.([ppp ] ) and the self - consistent pairing coefficient @xmath63 is expressed as @xmath64 the pairing - gap energy ( @xmath65 ) is defined as the average of the matrix elements of @xmath60 , that is , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the half the dimension of a subspace of given isospin ( @xmath68 ) . in the case of the present separable interaction ,",
    "the expression for the pairing gap is simply given as @xmath69 the pairing strength @xmath70 is determined in the standard manner by using the nilsson+bcs calculation with the initial values for the pairing gaps ( @xmath71 ) together with the @xmath59 .",
    "high - spin states are produced with the self - consistent cranking model .",
    "that is , the variational equation , @xmath72 is self - consistently solved by means of the gradient method under the following two constraints : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the total angular momentum , and @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the total particle number . in this study ,",
    "the usual one - dimensional cranking model is implemented , so that only one component of the total angular momentum vector is constrained .",
    "quantities @xmath77 and @xmath78 in the variational equation are the lagrange multipliers . the first multiplier is interpreted as the rotational frequency , while the second multiplier stands for the chemical potential .",
    "the presence of the chemical potential is due to the introduction of the bcs - type pairing correlation , which breaks the particle number conservation . as a result",
    ", the mean particle number needs to be constrained in the calculation .",
    "the hfb energy @xmath79 can be thus written as @xmath80 and this corresponds to the yrast spectrum .",
    "for the model space , two major shells ( @xmath81 , or the so - called sd - pf shell ) each for protons and neutrons are used , that is , d@xmath6,s@xmath82,d@xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) ; f@xmath85,p@xmath83,f@xmath6,p@xmath82 ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "this choice is in accordance with the kumar - baranger prescription for the p@xmath1q@xmath18q force @xcite .",
    "when a role of an intruder g@xmath5 ( @xmath87 ) orbital is discussed , it is also included in the model space .",
    "further details of the method are available in ref.@xcite .",
    "two @xmath0 nuclear systems will be studied in this paper , which are @xmath3ca and @xmath4ar .",
    "the former nucleus shows no sign of backbending so far ( up to @xmath88 ) , while the latter has a clear backbending at @xmath89 . with the p@xmath1q@xmath18q model based on the cranked hfb approach , we attempt to describe the superdeformed states in these nuclei in a self - consistent manner both in the ph- and pp-(hh- ) channels .",
    "the sd band of @xmath3ca is so far identified up to @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "this rotational band is regular and no backbending is currently observed .      as stated above",
    ", our model space contains the full sd- and pf - shells .",
    "it is thus possible to examine , in the framework of the self - consistent mean - field calculation , the core - polarization effect , or the influence coming from the d@xmath6 orbital truncated in the shell - model calculations .",
    "the occupation numbers of each single - particle orbital provides us useful information for this aim . before analyzing our own calculations ,",
    "it is worth learning the results obtained by others . in a description of the sd band of @xmath3ca through the shell - model diagonalization by poves @xcite ,",
    "the single - particle model space is set to be s@xmath82,d@xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) ; f@xmath85,p@xmath83,f@xmath6,p@xmath82 ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "( this choice of the model space was also used for @xmath4ar . )",
    "the d@xmath6 orbital is excluded from the valence space for the numerical reason . within this model space ( and the corresponding effective interaction ) , the 8p-8h configuration , that is , ( s@xmath82d@xmath83)@xmath90(fp)@xmath91 , was proposed for the description of the sd band .",
    "the calculated result based on this configuration reproduces the experimental data quite well with a well - tuned effective interaction @xcite .",
    "long and sun raised the question about the d@xmath6 truncation in their paper where they performed the psm ( projected shell model ) calculation@xcite . according to their analysis ,",
    "the d@xmath6 orbital does not contribute to the sd state in @xmath4ar , but to higher excited rotational bands .",
    "the cranked nilsson calculation performed for @xmath4ar @xcite is also informative .",
    "it was obtained that only about half a particle in each isospin sector is excited into higher orbitals from the d@xmath6 orbital . summarizing these results",
    ", it can be said that poves prescription for the truncation might be a good approximation for a description of the sd band .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     without the pairing , the cranked nilsson calculation suggests an occurrence of the band - termination phenomenon for the sd band of @xmath4ar @xcite .",
    "the typical feature of the band termination appears as a shape change into oblate deformation .",
    "earlier in the present study , we have learned that the triaxial deformation is suppressed with a proper treatment of the pairing ( fig.[qdef_ar36 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to study if the band termination and the associated oblate deformation can emerge in the absence of the pairing in our model .    by choosing the initial pairing - gap parameters to be very weak , that is , @xmath92 mev",
    ", the effect of the pairing correlation is examined in the following calculation .",
    "( the g@xmath5 orbital is included in this analysis . )",
    "this choice of the initial parameters causes the breakdown of the pairing as early as at @xmath93 .",
    "effectively , the calculation turns to be the hf calculation beyond this total angular momentum , which can be comparable with the cranked nilsson calculation without the pairing .",
    "the corresponding cranking calculation gives regular solutions until @xmath88 , the band termination point .",
    "but beyond the termination point , the solution becomes irregular and shows unphysical behavior , so that we ignore the calculations beyond the band termination point in this analysis . in the band termination",
    "spin ( @xmath88 ) , the occupation numbers of the f@xmath85 orbital are calculated to be 1.94 each for neutrons and protons .",
    "therefore , the net particles occupying the f@xmath85 orbital are four ( i.e. , @xmath94 ) , and the result is consistent with the shell model configuration .",
    "two particles occupying the f@xmath85 orbital can generate the maximum angular momentum of @xmath95 , which corresponds to the band termination . in fig.[algn_nnp ] , the calculated single - particle alignments are plotted for protons and neutrons .",
    "our calculation ( without the paring ) reproduces the above situation : the single - particle angular momentum carried by the f@xmath85 orbital is almost 12@xmath96 , consisting of @xmath97 for protons and @xmath97 for neutrons .    in fig.[qdef_ar36_np ] , the calculated quadrupole deformation , that is , triaxiality ( @xmath98 ) and elongation ( @xmath99 ) , are plotted .",
    "the profile for the elongation does not change from the previous case with the pairing correlation .",
    "however , the behavior of the triaxial evolution is different , especially beyond @xmath100 . at the band termination point",
    ", the value of @xmath98 reaches @xmath101 , indicating the non - collective oblate shape . from this analysis relying on the self - consistent cranking calculation",
    ", it is confirmed that the band termination phenomenon happens when the pairing correlation is absent from the system ( or very weak ) .      as a partial summary for @xmath4ar",
    ", we can conclude that the previously proposed structure , @xmath102 , seems to be a good approximation for the structure of @xmath4ar , according to our results .",
    "it is suggested that backbending in the sd band of @xmath4ar is caused by the alignment in the f@xmath85 orbitals , as concluded by the psm calculation @xcite .",
    "the g@xmath5 orbital does not play any significant role . from the successful description of the sd band at low spin and the failure in the backbending region",
    ", it was demonstrated that the pairing correlation is very important to describe the structure of the sd band .",
    "triaxial deformation starts to occur at high spin , but the degree of triaxiality is not so substantial that the sd states are well described as an axially symmetric nuclear many - body system .",
    "the self - consistent cranking calculation based on the hfb method was applied to the superdeformed bands of two @xmath0 nuclei , @xmath3ca and @xmath4ar .",
    "our microscopic calculations with the p@xmath1q@xmath18q interaction can manage to give good qualitative explanations ( occasionally quantitatively ) to the energy spectrum , rotational alignment , and backbending phenomenon of these nuclear systems .",
    "special attentions were paid to the roles of ( 1 ) the d@xmath6 orbital , which was removed from the sd - pf model space in the shell - model diagonalizations ; and ( 2 ) the g@xmath5 orbital , which belongs to a higher shell ( @xmath87 ) than the sd - pf shell .",
    "the effect of the pairing correlation was also investigated in connection to the evolution of triaxial deformation and the band termination phenomenon .    inside the framework of our model",
    ", it was found that the truncation of the d@xmath6 orbital can be justified as far as lower - spin states are considered .",
    "whereas , high - spin states are found to be produced due to a gradual excitation from the d@xmath6 orbital to the upper sd shell .",
    "however , in either case of @xmath3ca and @xmath4ar , an inclusion of the d@xmath6 orbital does not affect the nuclear structure of the sd states very much .    on the contrary ,",
    "the g@xmath5 orbital was found to change the nuclear structure drastically for @xmath3ca : backbending may happen at @xmath103 .",
    "however , the orbital plays no significant role for @xmath4ar .",
    "these differences come from the location of the fermi levels and the deformation ( @xmath99 ) , which is @xmath104 for @xmath3ca while @xmath105 for @xmath4ar .",
    "this difference influences the position of the g@xmath5 orbital as an `` intruder orbital '' into the sd shell , in terms of the deformed nilsson model .",
    "the pairing correlation was found to be important to produce a proper energy spectrum and tend to act as a suppressor of triaxial deformation . without the pairing",
    ", triaxial deformation would be enhanced and the non - collective oblate shape ( @xmath19 ) would ultimately emerge at high spin . however , in our model taking the pairing correlation into account , it is observed that triaxiality is suppressed to @xmath106 . in this sense ,",
    "the sd states of both @xmath3ca and @xmath4ar are nearly axial symmetric in our model , which can justify other calculations assuming the axial symmetry .    despite the success for the qualitative explanations , a problem was recognized in relation to the pairing collapse at high spin .",
    "an improvement is surely necessary for more accurate and quantitative descriptions of the high - spin structure , especially around the backbending region .",
    "nevertheless , through this work , the p@xmath1q@xmath18q model based on the cranked hfb approach was demonstrated to be a practical and effective model to describe high - spin nuclear structure showing superdeformation .",
