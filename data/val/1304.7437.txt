    "on the other hand , since the gain curve is very sensitive to the beam parameters such as the local ( slice ) energy spread , the transverse size of the beam , etc . , therefore small variations of them can change the gain of the instability appreciably .",
    "as a demonstration , we see in fig .",
    "[ gainslicespread ] that , as the local energy spread rises , the peak gain of the instability falls rapidly .",
    "we may therefore conclude that in reality the gain can deviate from what we expect because of the possible uncertainty of the beam parameters .",

    "the modulation of particle density could be suppressed excessively depending upon the choice of the mesh size .",
    "for example , if the mesh size is too large , the final gain computed by impact - z can be smaller than the realistic and the modulation wavelength will be longer .",
    "moreover , for a formula - based simulation code like elegant , smoothing is carried out by low - pass filters  @xcite when wakefields are computed .",

    "the longitudinal plasma oscillation wavelength calculated based on @xmath23  @xcite is about 120 m , where @xmath24 is the wave number of the oscillation , @xmath25 is the electron peak current , @xmath26 is the electron energy , @xmath27 is the horizontal beam size and @xmath28 ka is the alfvn current . because the plasma wavelength is much larger than the length of the first acceleration section ( l1 ) ( @xmath29 6 m ) before bc1 , we thus do not need to pay too much attention on the plasma effect at this point .",
    "however , the plasma effect in the injector must be investigated because of the low electron energy .",
    "in our study , some new issues are found to have profound effects on the final results of the microbunching instability and they need to be included in the computation .",
    "these issues include higher harmonics of beam current , transverse - longitudinal coupling in a bunch compressor , and the method of noise smoothing . in this section",

    "however , in our simulations , higher - order harmonics of beam current are also observed .",
    "we therefore believe that , in certain cases , higher harmonics should be included in the computation of the gain .",
    "preliminary studies tell us that the gain of the higher harmonics depends not only on the peak current of the beam , but also on the modulation depth .",
    "thus the inclusion of the higher - harmonics becomes a bit more complicated than the fundamental mode .",
    "as an example , fig .",
    "[ harmonics ] shows the excitation of higher harmonics simulated by elegant after the first bunch compressor ( bc1 ) with initial modulation wavelength of 100 @xmath22 m ( corresponding to 20 @xmath22 m in fig .  [ harmonics ] ) which is in the vicinity of the peak ( fig .",

    ", microbunching instability can hardly be excited .",
    "to reduce microbunching , there are ways to smooth the longitudinal current profile from the cathode by improving the temporal stability of driving laser .",
    "however , our investigation indicates that the density noise in the transverse direction can also introduce roughness to the longitudinal beam density distribution as a result of transverse - longitudinal coupling , for example , the @xmath34 elements in the transfer matrices of the dipoles in a bunch compressor .",

    "[ smoothall ] and  [ smoothlong ] show the current and energy spectra of the beams at the exit of the first chicane ( bc1 ) without laser heating . in the figures",
    ", one can see that the levels of density and energy fluctuation ( modulation ) of the 3-d smoothed beam are undoubtedly smaller than those when the beam is smoothed only longitudinally .",

    "[ laserheater ] shows the structure of the sxfel laser heater including an injection laser , an undulator , and a chicane - type bunch compressor .",
    "because of the transverse - longitudinal coupling , some extra noises are introduced into the longitudinal direction and the amplitudes of the modulations are also amplified when beam passing through the laser heater .",
    "figures  [ lh ] and  [ nolh ] show the current and energy spectra of a beam longitudinally smoothed but transversely noisy at the location right after the designed location of the laser heater with and without the laser heater included in the simulations .",
    "we can clearly see that the laser heater introduces extra peaks at various wavelengths and also increases the amplitudes of the current and energy modulation , which will compromise the beam quality thereafter .",
    "for this reason , the @xmath34 element of the magnetic chicane should be revisited with more care .",
    "the parameters of the sxfel laser heater used in the simulation are : length 0.55 m , periods 10 , undulator magnetic peak field 0.31 t , laser peak power 0.80 mw , laser spot size at waist 0.30 mm .",
    "-0.10 in     -0.10 in     -0.10 in      when computing wakefields , noise smoothing is always performed by the simulation code to obtain the beam distribution .",
    "for example , in elegant , the savitzky - golay filter is used to smooth the longitudinal beam current profile ( thus reducing the noise ) in the course of computing various kinds of wakefields .",
    "because the method of smoothing has a strong influence on the final results , it must be investigated with care .",
    "the savitzky - golay ( s - g ) smoothing filter is a filter that performs a local polynomial regression ( of degree @xmath0 ) on a series of values ( of at least @xmath36 points which are treated as being equally spaced in the series ) to determine the smoothed value for each point  @xcite .",
    "this filtering algorithm was first described in 1964 by abraham savitzky and marcel j. e. golay  @xcite .",
    "they proposed a method of data smoothing based on local least - square polynomial approximation and showed that fitting a polynomial to a set of input samples and then evaluating the resulting polynomial at a single point within the approximation interval is equivalent to the discrete convolution with a fixed impulse response .",
    "the low - pass filters obtained by this method are widely known as savitzky - golay filters . in general",
    ", there are two key parameters in this method , one is the order , the other is the half - width .",
    "the former represents the highest order in the polynomial fit , while the latter corresponds to the number data points needed to be sampled in the smoothing .",
    "-0.10 in    in our study , we vary the half width of the s - g filter in the elegant input , and discover that the difference between the output slice energy spreads with different s - g half - widths is significant ( fig .",
    "[ sgdgamma ] ) .",
    "this is understandable because stronger suppression of noise results in stronger reduction of local energy spread ( excessive smoothing ) .",
    "therefore here comes the problem : how to differentiate the real noise from the numerical noise in simulation ?",
    "we suggest to use the s - g filter with caution ( e.g. , using filter half - width  @xmath37 ) and to use as many macro - particles as possible within the capability of hardware . in our elegant simulations here",
    ", we fix the s - g filter half - width at 1 and employ 1 million macro - particles .",
    "the study of microbunching instability in the sxfel linac is performed in detail as a classic example . the potential problems and some new effects",
    "are uncovered including the initial beam distribution , the higher order modes in the noise amplification , the transverse - longitudinal coupling and the plasma effect in the computation of lsc .",
    "more investigations are needed to obtain deeper insights of those problems .",
    "computations using both analytic expressions and numerical simulations show that the gain of the microbunching instability indicates large discrepancy between the noisy and the smoothed beam input . since in the real case",
    ", there is always noise introduced by the shot noise , the laser power jitters , etc .",
    ", one should consider how much noise to be included in the initial input . on the other hand",
    ", our work shows that in terms of the final density / energy fluctuation ( or the bunching factor ) , the difference between the noisy and the smoothed input is not large .",
    "a particle - in - cell ( pic ) code appears to be a better tool for the study of microbunching instability because of its intrinsic advantage  the electromagnetic fields are computed by solving fundamental physical equations , i.e. , the poisson solver . as a result , a pic code can be better in revealing the detailed physical process of the instability than a code based on analytic formulae .",
    "however , like all the other codes , the noise - smoothing method must be investigated to see whether it will introduce extra uncertainty .",
    "the challenging problem is how to separate and discard the numerical noise from the real one .",

    "the higher - order harmonics of beam current that revises the linear theory in the estimate of the gain should also be included in the development of the analytic formulae , especially in the vicinity of the peak gain .",
