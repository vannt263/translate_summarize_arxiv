    "main - belt comet p/2012 f5 ( gibbs ) ( hereafter p / gibbs ) was discovered in the course of the mt .",
    "lemmon survey on ut 2012 mar .",
    "22.89 @xcite .",
    "the object showed a narrow dust tail 7@xmath5 in length , and was identified as a main - belt comet ( mbc ) owing to its orbital parameters .",
    "mbcs have dynamical properties of asteroids ( i.e. , tisserand parameters respect to jupiter larger than 3 ) , but physical characteristics of comets ( gas and/or dust emission ) . the total members of this new class of small solar system objects amount to nine ( the 9th becoming p / gibbs ) , so that the statistics is still poor so as to identify their global physical properties or dynamical history . for reviews on those objects ,",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "most of the mbcs have been shown to be dynamically stable on timescales of 100 myr or longer @xcite suggesting that they are native members of the main asteroid belt and not captured objects from elsewhere @xcite .",
    "this is strongly supported by dynamical and spectroscopic arguments that show that some of them belong to well established asteroid collisional families and that their spectra is different to that of `` normal '' comets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , there are some members as 238p / read and p/2008 r1 that are stable for 20 - 30 myr only @xcite .",
    "regarding their activity , some are clearly recurrent , as 133p / elst - pizarro and 238p @xcite , while some others like ( 596 ) scheila appear to have ejected dust via an impulsive event that might be associated to a collision @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", p/2010 r2 ( la sagra ) and 2006 vw139 appeared to be continuously active during periods of at least 200 days and 100 days , respectively @xcite .",
    "observations and analysis of p / gibbs have been recently shown by @xcite , who report on the impulsive character of the emission of the dust , the outburst date , the mass of the ejecta , and establish limits to the nucleus size . in this paper",
    "we report images in the red spectral domain acquired with instrumentation attached to the 10.4-m gran telescopio canarias ( gtc ) of p / gibbs at two different dates , and perform an interpretation of the observed trail brightness using a forward monte carlo tail model , in order to provide estimates of the dust emission times , the ejected mass , the particle ejection velocities , and their size distribution function .",
    "we also set limits to the nucleus size based on the escape velocity , and compare our results to those by @xcite .",
    "ccd images of p / gibbs were collected under photometric conditions on the nights of 18 may and 8 june 2012 , using a sloan @xmath6 filter in the optical system for image and low resolution integrated spectroscopy ( osiris ) camera - spectrograph @xcite at the gtc .",
    "the osiris instrument consists of two marconi ccd detectors , each with 2048@xmath74096 pixels and a total unvignetted field of view of 7.8@xmath87.8@xmath5 .",
    "the plate scale was 0.127 @xmath9/px , but we used a binning of 2@xmath72 pixels in order to improve the signal to noise ratio , so that the spatial resolution of the images is 485 km px@xmath1 and 540 km px@xmath1 on may 18.9 and june 8.9 , respectively .",
    "the images were bias subtracted and flat - field corrected using standard procedures .",
    "a total of 18 images were acquired each night and calibrated using standard stars .",
    "the images were converted to solar disk intensity units appropriate for the analysis in terms of dust tail models , and a median stack image was obtained for analysis for each date ( see figure 1 ) . as a result of both the flux calibration and the median stacking procedure , we estimated a total flux uncertainty in the combined images of 0.3 mag .",
    "the images were finally rotated to the @xmath10 coordinate system @xcite .",
    "we have performed an analysis of the two images shown in figure 1 by a direct monte carlo dust tail model .",
    "this model was used to characterize the dust environments of various comets and mbcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , being applied in particular to comet 67p / churyumov - gerasimenko , the target of _ rosetta _ mission to arrive to the comet in 2014 ( the so - called granada model , see * ? ? ?",
    "the code is used to compute the trajectory of a large number of grains ejected from a cometary or asteroidal surface .",
    "we assume that the only governing forces on those dust particles are the solar gravity and the radiation pressure .",
    "thus , the gravity of the object itself is neglected , which constitutes a good approximation for small - sized nuclei . in the case of cometary activity ,",
    "we consider that the particles are accelerated by gas drag from ice sublimation to their terminal velocities , which are the input ejection velocities considered in the model , that is applicable for any other ejection mechanism .",
    "once ejected , the particles describe a keplerian trajectory around the sun , whose orbital elements are computed from the terminal velocity and the ratio of the force exerted by the solar radiation pressure and the solar gravity ( the @xmath11 parameter , see * ? ? ?",
    "this parameter can be expressed as @xmath12 , where @xmath13=1.19@xmath7 10@xmath14 kg m@xmath15 , @xmath16 is the radiation presure coefficient , and @xmath17 is the particle density . for each observation date , the trajectories of a large number of dust particles are computed , and then their positions on the @xmath10 plane are calculated .",
    "finally , their contribution to the tail brightness is computed .    before applying the model",
    ", we performed a preliminary analysis of the images in terms of a synchrone map @xcite , which provides us with an approximate idea on the time interval at which the particles were ejected from the nucleus related to the observation date .",
    "figure 2 shows the two images as well as the corresponding synchrones at times of @xmath0100 , @xmath020 , @xmath010 and 0 days relative to the 2011 july 3rd synchrone , the one which is approximately best aligned with the narrow trail in each image .",
    "the smallest sized particles in the 2011 july 3rd synchrones have @xmath18130 @xmath2 m and @xmath18180 @xmath2 m for the two observing dates , respectively .",
    "these diagrams indicate that all the dust particles having @xmath19130 @xmath2 m were ejected during a very short time interval around that date , because otherwise the trails would have been wider towards the lowermost portions of the trails , even if they were ejected with zero velocity respect to the nucleus",
    ". therefore , an impulsive event must be the responsible of the ejection of dust , so that an outburst , a collision with another body , or a rotational disruption could be in principle invoked among the responsible mechanisms .",
    "the precise event date , and its duration , is to be determined on the basis of the monte carlo dust tail analysis ( see section 4 ) .    an important aspect of the observations and the modeling is the location of the asteroid nucleus .",
    "we will work under the assumption that the object nucleus is immersed in the dust cloud , and that the optocenter of this cloud corresponds to the actual location of the nucleus .",
    "we further assume that the observed brightness is dominated by the dust , the contribution of the nucleus being negligible .",
    "this hypothesis would be tested on the basis of the nucleus size derived from arguments based on the escape velocity .",
    "a number of simplifying assumptions on the physical parameters must be made in order to make the problem tractable .",
    "thus , we assume that the trail is composed of spherical particles of carbonaceous composition , having a refractive index at red wavelengths of m=1.88 + 0.71@xmath20 @xcite , which implies a geometric albedo of @xmath21=0.036 , and a pressure radiation coefficient of @xmath22 1 for particles of radius @xmath231 @xmath2 m",
    "* their figure 5 ) .",
    "we further assume that the particles have a density of 1000 kg m@xmath14 .",
    "the particle size distribution is assumed to follow a power - law of index @xmath24 , and the terminal velocities are described as a function of the @xmath11 parameter as @xmath25 .",
    "this relationship is generally accepted for the terminal velocities of comet dust , and also for fragments ejected from collision experiments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the total ejected dust mass ( @xmath26 ) and the maximum size of the ejected particles ( @xmath27 ) must be also specified , as well as the starting time ( @xmath28 ) and the duration of the event ( @xmath29 ) . in summary",
    ", there are a total of seven adjustable parameters to fit the observations ( @xmath24 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 ) .",
    "we attempted to fit the observed dust trail brightness by minimizing the function @xmath32 , where the subscripts 1 and 2 correspond to the images obtained in 2012 may 18.9 and 2012 june 8.9 , respectively , and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 are the observed trail intensities and @xmath35 are the fitted intensities , the summation being extended in principle to all the image pixels @xmath36 .",
    "since there are some regions in the images that are strongly contaminated by bright field stars , we restricted the summation to pixels outside those regions , and located mostly along the trails .",
    "the minimization procedure was performed by the multidimensional downhill simplex algorithm @xcite , using the fortran implementation described in @xcite .",
    "each of those parameters influence the derived trail brightness in different ways .",
    "thus , @xmath30 controls the width of the trail , @xmath31 influences the variation of the width of the trail along it , @xmath24 constraints the slope of the brightness along the trail , the total ejected mass influences the overall brightness , and the maximum particle size controls the brightness mainly at the head of the trail , so that if @xmath37 is set to a small value ( say , smaller than several centimeters ) the peak of brightness is displaced significantly trailward and the fit becomes impossible . regarding the minimum particle size , it is not a free parameter , as it is found by the intersection of the synchrone that is best aligned with the trails and the @xmath38 axis , which corresponds in our images to @xmath39130 @xmath2 m and @xmath39180 @xmath2 m for 2012 may 18.9 and 2012 june 8.9 , respectively .",
    "since the downhill simplex method searches for a local minimum of the function in the parameter space , we performed several runs by varying the starting simplex .",
    "we found that all runs tend to converge to close local minima , giving similar values of @xmath40 .",
    "the deepest global minimum was then taken as the best fit , which has @xmath40=4.9@xmath710@xmath41 solar disk units ( see table 1 , and figure 3 ) .",
    "unfortunately , this technique does not provide any estimate of the uncertainty in the derived parameters . to estimate those uncertainties , we determined the errors by perturbing the observed image intensities by the flux uncertainties and then finding a new best fit .",
    "in addition , we verified that outside the error limits for each one of the fitted parameters displayed in table 1 , no satisfying solutions were found . to do",
    "that , we tried to fit the model with values outside the parameter bounds specified in the table , and could not find satisfying solutions in any case .",
    "an important result is that the derived ejection velocities are almost independent on size ( @xmath31=0.04@xmath42 ) , ranging from about 10 to 8 cm s@xmath1 for particles between the lower and upper size limits ( 130 @xmath2 m and 28 cm ) .",
    "this flat dependence of ejection velocities on size have been previously inferred in our analysis of the outburst of the asteroid ( 596 ) scheila , for which we found @xmath31=0.05 @xcite .",
    "this dependence is markedly different to that expected from gas drag by ice sublimation processes as occur in most comets , with typical values of @xmath430.5 , and could be associated to a collision event as was suggested for scheila @xcite , although it can not be confirmed . on the other hand ,",
    "if we equate the velocity of the slowest moving particles ( @xmath44=8 cm s@xmath1 for @xmath45=28 cm particles ) to the escape velocity , we obtain a nucleus radius of @xmath46=107 m to @xmath46=152 m , considering bulk densities of 1000 to 500 kg m@xmath14 . at this point",
    ", it is interesting to note that computer simulations at the catastrophic disruption threshold reveal that ejecta velocities depend on target size and that ejection velocities of the order of those obtained here ( @xmath3910 cm s@xmath1 ) could be compatible with both porous and non - porous targets of @xmath39100 m radius @xcite .",
    "our derived target radius is a far more stringent constraint than that of @xmath46@xmath472.1 km derived by @xcite based on the non - detection of the nucleus on images taken by the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) . on the other hand , using the formalism by @xcite , and assuming a slope parameter of @xmath48=0.15 , and a bulk geometric albedo of @xmath21=0.15 , the apparent magnitude of a @xmath46=125 m nucleus at the same phase angle and geocentric and heliocentric distances than p / gibbs would be just above @xmath49=26 , which represents a negligible contribution to the brightness compared with that at the optocenter of the trails",
    "this is compatible with our initial hypothesis on that the dust cloud brightness dominates the trail optocenter .",
    "an object of such a small size might have a very small rotation period that could be under the critical rotation period for fracture so that a rotational disruption could also be argued as the cause of the event @xcite , provided it produces a sudden release of material .",
    "a small - sized nucleus was also derived for p/2010 a2 ( linear ) , the innermost mbc discovered so far , whose tail has been also reported by many authors as the result of an impulsive event ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and not as the result of a sustained activity as we suggested @xcite .    the size distribution power index , which essentially controls the slope of the trail brightness , is 3.7@xmath00.1 .",
    "the maximum ejected particle size derived is @xmath45=28@xmath010 cm ( table 1 ) . a maximum size smaller than the lower bound",
    "would imply a significant displacement of the maximum of brightness trailward .",
    "conversely , a size larger than the upper bound would make the slope of the synthetic trail much steeper than observed .",
    "the minimum ejected dust mass is ( 5@xmath02)@xmath710@xmath50 kg , which is near the value reported by @xcite for p/2010 a2 ( 8@xmath710@xmath50 kg ) .",
    "this is an order of magnitude higher than reported by @xcite , although their result is just based on a measure of the total geometric cross section of the trail and assuming a mean size for the ejected particles , not a size distribution .",
    "this total mass is in fact a lower limit , since we can not precise neither the amount of small ( @xmath51100 @xmath2 m ) particles released , nor the component of particles traveling at high speed that could result as consequence of e.g. a collision , if this were the case .",
    "the best - fit event date ( 2011 july 1st ) agrees with that derived by @xcite within the error limits ( they derived 2011 july 7th as the event date ) .",
    "the duration of the event is constrained to be of less than a day . in the @xmath521 day space",
    ", it is always possible to find a set of fitting parameters giving similar values of @xmath40 .",
    "the fits shown in figure 3 correspond to an event duration of 0.13 day , i.e. , just above 3 hours .",
    "an impulsive event is , then , clearly implied .",
    "from the monte carlo dust tail modeling of the observations of main - belt comet p/2012 f5 ( gibbs ) we can derive the following conclusions :    \\1 ) the direct study of the mbc images in term of synchrone analysis imply an impulsive event as the cause of the observed trails .",
    "we predict the event to have occurred on 2011 july 1st , with an accuracy of @xmath010 days . in this respect , we agree with the results recently reported by @xcite for this mbc , not only in the nature , but also in the event date within the errors ( they report on a impulsive event on 2011 july 7th with an uncertainty of @xmath020 days ) .",
    "the duration of the event is constrained to be less than 1 day , possibly less than a few hours .",
    "\\2 ) the nature of the impulsive event is impossible to determine with the sole information of the physical parameters derived from this analysis . among the likely causes ,",
    "an outburst , a collision with another body , or a rotational disruption could be invoked .",
    "activity related to ice sublimation seems unlikely on the basis of the dependence of the particle ejection velocities on size , which interestingly turns out to be very similar to that we found for ( 596 ) scheila @xcite , a very likely impacted asteroid .",
    "\\3 ) the total dust mass released is @xmath535@xmath710@xmath50 kg . the ejected particles are distributed in size following a power - law of index 3.7@xmath00.1 .",
    "the maximum particle size ejected is about 30 cm , with a velocity of @xmath398 cm s@xmath1 . adopting this value as the escape velocity",
    ", the size of the nucleus is constrained to about 100 - 150 m in radius , for bulk body densities in the range 1000 - 500 kg m@xmath14 .",
