    "to understand a mechanism of chemical and physical interactions between hydrogen plasmas and divertor plates in a nuclear fusion device , it is necessary to study an elementary processes of the reactions . in molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations ,",
    "the equations of motion of atoms are solved numerically .",
    "we investigated plasma - wall interaction on the divertor plates made of carbon materials by the md simulation with modified brenner s reactive empirical bond order ( rebo ) potential  @xcite in the previous works  @xcite .",
    "a typical scale length of the md simulation box in these works are several nm .    in order to expand the simulation box to more realistic scale length , i.e. , several @xmath0 m , we develop a hybrid simulation code between the md simulation code with the rebo potential and atomic collision in any structured target(ac@xmath1 t ) code  @xcite . in the ac@xmath1 t code , which uses binary collision approximation ( bca ) , a two - body interaction",
    "is calculated instead of computing all particles for every step in the md simulation . therefore computation time",
    "we choose the ac@xmath1 t code as the partner of the md simulation for its fast calculation of a location and a velocity of the particle .",
    "the main problem of hybridization between the two simulation codes is how to define a threshold kinetic energy of the injection particle . for higher kinetic energy of particle",
    "than the threshold kinetic energy , we calculate the trajectory of the particle by the ac@xmath1 t code . as the kinetic energy",
    "is dissipated to its surroundings and attaches to the threshold kinetic energy @xmath2 , we give a position and a velocity of the projectile to the md simulation code as the initial condition .",
    "then we perform the md simulation . generally speaking ,",
    "because a multi - body interaction with the neighborhood of the projectile must be calculated in the md simulation code with the rebo potential , computation time becomes longer than in the ac@xmath1 t code . to make the performance of the simulation better",
    ", it is necessary to shorten the md simulation and extend the ac@xmath1 t simulation box .",
    "however , it is known that the ac@xmath1 t code can not calculate exactly the particle motion in a low energy . comparing the md simulation with the ac@xmath1 t simulation , two simulation results are consistent in higher kinetic energy than 200 ev  @xcite .",
    "thus we set @xmath2=200 ev at which a simulation algorithm changes from the ac@xmath1 t simulation to the md simulation .",
    "a concept of hybrization between the md simulation and the ac@xmath1 t simulation is that the ac@xmath1 t simulation works when a kinetic energy of a projectile is higher than the threshold energy @xmath3 ev , while the md simulation works when the kinetic energy becomes lower than the threshold energy @xmath2 .",
    "t - md hybrid simulation of hydrogen injection onto a graphite . ]",
    "to explain the hybrid simulation more concretely , let s consider a hydrogen atom injection onto a graphite ( fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] ) .",
    "an injection kinetic energy of the hydrogen atom is set to 1 kev , which is higher than @xmath2 . while the kinetic energy of the hydrogen atom is higher than @xmath2 , trajectories of the hydrogen atom and the surrounding carbon atoms are calculated by the ac@xmath1 t simualtion .",
    "the hydrogen atom dissipates its kinetic energy by interacting with carbon atoms in diamond and then the kinetic energy becomes lower than @xmath2 . at that moment ,",
    "the md simulation starts to calculate the motions of the hydrogen and the carbon instead of the ac@xmath1 t .",
    "some of carbon atoms which collide with the incident hydrogen are kicked out on the way of the ac@xmath1 t simulation .",
    "the motions of all kicked carbons in the cascade process are solved by the same procedure as the incident hydrogen .    in order to realize the above hybrid simulation , we use multiple program multiple data ( mpmd )  @xcite which was developed to execute different programs parallely in one simulation with synchronizing their data . using the mpmd , we control four programes , i.e. , ( i ) master program , ( ii ) ac@xmath1 t program , ( iii ) md program and ( iv ) splitting program as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] .",
    "the master process is installed between the ac@xmath1 t and md processes for data synchronization .",
    "after an initialization of each process ( fig .",
    "[ fig04](1 ) and ( 2 ) ) , the ac@xmath1 t process ( 3 ) is executed until the kinetic energy of the incident hydrogen and all kicked atoms become lower than @xmath2 .",
    "when the kinetic energies of all atoms becomes lower than @xmath2 , the ac@xmath1 t process sends , to the master process , a list of the position and velocity of the moving atoms as a result of the ac@xmath1 t simulation . the master process ( 4 ) informs the splitter process of the completion of the ac@xmath1 t process with the list of moved atoms .",
    "the splitter process updates its material data with the list of moved atoms .",
    "( 5 ) then , the md simulation box are picked up from the entire target material and they are sent to the md processes .",
    "the md simulation is started in each md processes .",
    "( 6 ) we will explain the algorithm of the ac@xmath1 t simulation , the md simulation and the splitting program in the following subsections .",
    "t - md hybrid simulation code . ]",
    "a binary collision between a projectile and a target atom is necessary in the ac@xmath1 t simulation  @xcite . during the binary collision , a total energy , a total momentum and a total angular momentum",
    "are conserved . due to these conservations ,",
    "the final position and velocity of the projectile and the target atom are obtained analytically on a potential @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the distance between the projectile and the target atom . in the ac@xmath1 t code similarly to the acat code , the moliere approximation is adopted and then @xmath4 is given by the thomas - fermi potential as follows : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a screening length , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are atomic numbers of the projectile and the target atom , respectively . unlike the md simulation , the ac@xmath1 t simulation directry gives us the asymptotic trajectory of the projectile collided with the target . in the ac@xmath1 t simulation",
    ", the projectile hits the target atoms and then it brings about cascade shower in the large simulation box .      the equation of motion in the md simlation",
    "is written by @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the position , momentum and the mass of the @xmath13-th atom .",
    "the function @xmath14 is total potential energy . in our md simulation",
    ", the modified rebo potential is used for the potential @xmath14 which is defined as : @xmath15}^{\\rm r}(r_{ij } ) - \\bar{b}_{ij}(\\{r\\ } , \\{\\theta^{\\rm b}\\ } , \\{\\theta^{\\rm dh}\\ } ) v_{[ij]}^{\\rm a}(r_{ij } ) , \\label{eq4}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the distance between the @xmath13-th and the @xmath17-th atoms .",
    "the functions @xmath18}^{\\mathrm{r}}$ ] and @xmath18}^{\\mathrm{a}}$ ] represent repulsion and attraction , respectively .",
    "the function @xmath19 generates a multi - body force .",
    "the bond angle @xmath20 is the angle between the vector from the @xmath13-th atom to the @xmath17-th atom and the vector from the @xmath13-th atom to the @xmath21-th atom .",
    "the dihedral angle @xmath22 is the angle between the plane passing through the @xmath21-th , @xmath13-th , and @xmath17-th atoms and the plane passing through the @xmath13-th , @xmath17-th , and @xmath23-th atoms .",

    "the second - order symplectic integration@xcite is used to execute the time integration of the equation of motion where the time step is set to @xmath28 .",
    "unlike the acat simulation , the md simulation can not treat a large scale material . to calculate efficiently , local boxs @xmath29 on a side",
    "are picked up , and the simulation for the atoms in each box is executed in parallel . to obtain precise forces acting on all atoms in the md simulation boxs @xmath29 on a side , the bond energy @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) is calculated in a larger cubic box @xmath31 on a side .",
    "furthermore , the function @xmath32 depends on more outer covalent bonds .",
    "consequently , the md process needs the positions of atoms in a cubic box @xmath33 on a side .",
    "namely , in the md process , the equations of motions are solved about atoms in the cubic box @xmath29 on a side , and forces acting on the atoms are calculated by aggregating surrounding atoms in a cubic box @xmath34 on a side as shown in fig . [ fig05 ] .          by the mpmd method",
    ", one cpu is allocated into the md process treating one cubic box @xmath34 on a side .",
    "however , there is the special case that two or more cubic boxs overlap because the moving particles are close .",
    "these overlapping boxs are regarded as a combined md simulation box for one cpu process . the determination for the md simulation box",
    "is carried out by the splitting program ( see fig .  [ fig06 ] ) as follows .",
    "the simulation box in the ac@xmath1 t code is divided into cubic cells @xmath35 on a side , where @xmath35 is the cutoff length of covalent bond in the rebo potential .",
    "@xmath36 cells , which are corresponding to the cubic box @xmath33 on side , are marked up .",
    "only a center cell of the marked cells is a member of the md simulation box , initially .",
    "the center cell is set to the first target cell and the member of the md simulation box is selected by the following recursive routine : if adjoining cells of the target cell has been marked up , they are added into the member of the md simulation box and become next target cells , while if they have not been marked up , the recursive routine is stopped .",
    "we demonstrate an ac@xmath1t - md hybrid simulation for a hydrogen atom injection onto a graphite , whose size is @xmath37 long , @xmath38 wide and @xmath39 depth which consists of 100 graphene .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed on the horizontal direction .",
    "the initial temperature of the graphite is set to zero kelvin .",
    "the hydrogen atom is injected normaly onto the surface at 1 kev .",
    ".the average of the depth @xmath40 and the horizontal distance @xmath41 of 900 injections .",

    "+    900 simulations with the same initial material and randomly changed injection position have been performed . as a bench - mark , stand alone ac@xmath1 t simulations have also been performed .",

    "although the averages of depth in the both cases are almost equal , the average and the standard deviation of horizontal distance by the ac@xmath1t - md hybrid simulation are smaller than that of the ac@xmath1 t simulation .",

    "as shown in the trajectory ` a ' in fig .",
    "[ fig07](a ) , the incident hydrogen atom moved the long distance along the interlayer region of the graphite , because the ac@xmath1 t code does not treat the binding from surrounding atoms .",
