    "the binarity of stars is a topic of ongoing research , particularly in light of the plethora of exoplanets discovered over the past couple of decades .",
    "exoplanets orbiting stars with a binary companions pose significant implications for formation theories , such as orbital stability @xcite , and the period - mass @xcite and period - eccentricity @xcite distributions . the searches for stellar companions to the host stars of _ kepler _ exoplanet candidates has become an important component of the candidate validation process @xcite .",
    "attempts to detect binarity for the brightest exoplanet host stars are also underway @xcite , and are often used to place constraints on additional planetary companions @xcite .",
    "when it comes to multiplicity , one of the more exotic exoplanetary systems is that of 30 arietus ( hereafter 30 ari ) .",
    "30 ari is a bound visual binary whose main components are both main sequence f stars ( f5v and f6v ) separated by 38.1(1,500  au ) .",
    "the a and b components are both relatively bright ( @xmath0 magnitudes of 6.48 and 7.09 respectively ) .",
    "30  ari  a is a spectroscopic binary @xcite with an orbital period of 1.1 days .",
    "30  ari  b ( hd 16232 , hip 12184 , hr 764 ) was discovered by @xcite to have a @xmath110  @xmath2 companion with an orbital period of 335 days .",
    "the discovery was made using radial velocity ( rv ) observations which are not easy to undertake for such an early - type star , despite its brightness .",
    "the reason for this is that the spectra of early - type stars have a relatively small number of absorption lines and also tend to have rapid rotation rates , thus inhibiting precision rv measurements .",
    "the brightness of 30  ari  b in close proximity to the equally bright a component also proves problematic for photometric observations and so the system remained relatively unobserved for the years following the exoplanet discovery . recently",
    "30  ari  b was revisited using the adaptive optics capabilities of the robo - ao system @xcite with target selection from the fg-67 database @xcite .",
    "the survey detected a stellar companion to the star @xcite that was further described by @xcite .",
    "here we present new observations of the 30  ari  b system that independently confirm the presence of a stellar companion in addition to the known planet orbiting the host star .",
    "section [ stellar ] outlines the properties of 30  ari  b relevant to the subsequent analysis .",
    "section [ detection ] describes the detection of the stellar companion from keck observations and the likelihood of the stars being bound .",
    "new rv and photometric data are presented in section [ rvphot ] which both are used to support the detection of the stellar companion and refine the properties of the known planet .",
    "constraints on the physical and orbital properties of the stellar companion from these observations and orbital stability considerations are described in section [ properties ] .",
    "we provide concluding remarks in section [ con ] including a discussion of names for the system components .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     30  ari  b was observed using the 0.6 m telescope at the peter van de kamp observatory , swarthmore college on the nights of november 15th and 16th , 2014 .",
    "observations were conducted in good weather conditions using an r filter and 10 second exposures .",
    "30  ari  a provided a natural comparison star from which to perform relative photometry since it is similar in both brightness and color . based upon the _ hipparcos _ dips , a possible event was predicted for a jd of around 2,456,976 .",
    "these data are shown in the middle and bottom panels of figure [ photfig ] .",
    "though no event similar to that seen in the _ hipparcos _ data was detected , the star was observed to be consistently stable at the level of a couple of millimags",
    ". these data also rule out significant stellar pulsations of periods less than @xmath16  hours .",
    "it is certainly possible that the outlier measurements in the _ hipparcos _ dataset are simply spurious , but the curious coincidence with the orbital period of the planet leads us to encourage continued observations .",
    "the properties of the stellar companion may be further constrained from orbital dynamics considerations , as we describe in this section .      the mass and separation of the stellar companion to 30  ari  b",
    "may be constrained from the linear trend detected in the rv data ( see section [ rv ] ) .",
    "the trend does not exhibit a `` turn - around '' point where the slope changes from negative to positive .",
    "however , the total amplitude of the trend over the time baseline of the observations places a lower limit on the semi - amplitude of the variations due to the companion .",
    "the trend shown in table [ planet ] multiplied by the time baseline ( 2,536 days ) yields a minimum rv amplitude of @xmath1305  ms@xmath3 .",
    "the left panel of figure [ propfig ] shows the resulting mass / separation limits where the linear trend has been converted to an acceleration , @xmath4 and then converted to a mass estimate via @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the mass of the detected binary companion , and we have assumed a circular orbit . the limit is shown as a solid line and the dashed lines represent the 1@xmath8 uncertainties propagated from the linear trend uncertainties .",
    "anything below these lines has either insufficient mass or proximity to the host star to produce the observed trend . since we know from the angular separation ( see section  [ detection ] ) that the companion semi - major axis is at least 21.9  au ( vertical dotted line ) , the companion lower mass limit is @xmath127 jupiter masses .",
    "the valid area of parameter - space shown in the figure may thus be constrained to the shaded region .",
    "an additional constraint on the companion mass may be applied by extending the above methodology , as described by @xcite .",
    "the physical separation between the 30  ari  b stars , if they are bound , is 21.9  au / @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the angle between our line - of - sight and the primary - secondary vector ( @xmath11 implies the secondary is behind the primary ) . if the secondary is the source of the rv linear trend described in section [ rv ] , then it imparts a line - of - sight acceleration of @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the physical separation with no assumption regarding orbital eccentricity .",
    "this leads to the following expression for the companion mass : @xmath14 the cubic term in the denominator must be negative since @xmath15 is negative and @xmath7 is positive .",
    "furthermore , because the cosine function is bound between -1 and 1 , the cubic s value lies between -0.385 and zero .",
    "the equation therefore becomes an inequality for @xmath7 : @xmath16 where we have substituted the linear trend from table [ planet ] .",
    "this results in a minimum mass of the stellar companion of @xmath17 , consistent with the companion being m1 - 3 as determined in section [ detection ] .",
    "the calculated properties of the companion , including the mass of 30  ari  b and the projected separation , result in a minimum orbital period of @xmath18 years .",
    "this is consistent with the companion being of stellar mass producing an observed long timescale rv trend .",
    "the existence of a planet located @xmath11  au from the host star may be used to place further constraints on the orbit of the stellar companion .",
    "planets have been detected in both s - type and p - type orbits , the stability of which have been investigated by numerous authors @xcite .",
    "we use the analytical solutions provided by @xcite to determine the range of binary separations and eccentricities that will allow the planetary orbit to remain stable . to do this , we invert equation 1 of @xcite as follows @xmath19 + ( -0.380 \\pm 0.010 ) \\mu \\nonumber",
    "\\\\ +    ( -0.631 \\pm 0.034 ) e + ( 0.586 \\pm 0.061 ) \\mu e \\nonumber \\\\ + ( 0.150    \\pm 0.041 ) e^2 + ( -0.198 \\pm 0.074 ) \\mu e^2]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the binary separation , @xmath21 is the binary orbital eccentricity , and @xmath22 is the maximum allowed semi - major axis of the planet . the mass ratio , @xmath23 , is defined as @xmath24 , and is thus @xmath25 for an equal mass binary .",
    "the right panel of figure [ propfig ] shows the binary separation and eccentricity limitations for three different mass ratios with the constraint that a planet must be allowed to exist at @xmath26  au .",
    "we have the additional constraint imposed by the projected separation of 21.9  au , represented by the horizontal dotted line . based on our spectral type estimate of m1 ,",
    "we adopt a mass for the companion of 0.5  @xmath27 resulting in a mass ratio of @xmath28 .",
    "thus , the valid regions of the plot exist above both the dotted and dashed lines . for a companion separation equal to the projected separation",
    ", the eccentricity of the binary orbit must be less than @xmath29 .",
    "lcc angular separation ( ) & @xmath30 & [ detection ] + projected separation ( au ) & @xmath31 & [ detection ] + @xmath32 magnitude & @xmath33 & [ detection ] + apparent @xmath34 magnitude & @xmath35 & [ detection ] + absolute @xmath34 magnitude & @xmath36 & [ detection ] + spectral type & m1 - 3 & [ detection ] + rv linear trend ( m / s / day ) & @xmath37 & [ rv ] + mass ( @xmath27 ) & @xmath38 & [ massorbit ] + orbital period ( years ) & @xmath39 & [ massorbit ] + orbital eccentricity ( @xmath40  au ) & @xmath41 & [ stability ]",
    "in this paper , we have presented significant new observations that attempt to describe the detected objects orbiting 30  ari  b. table [ summary ] summarizes our derived parameters of the stellar companion to 30  ari  b. the 30  ari system as a whole is clearly quite complex with the a and b components harboring planetary and stellar companions .",
    "this complexity may be attributed partially to the relative youth of the system since a and b are each less than 1 gyr in age @xcite , although the hierarchical structure of the system is likely stable for long timescales . additionally , the relatively large ( minimum ) separation of the detected stellar companion to 30  ari  b produces orbital motion that makes it difficult to constraint the orbital inclination .",
    "if the companion and the known planet are coplanar then that would have significant implcations for the formation and evolutionary history of the system and provide additional constraints on the overall system stability .",
    "further observations of the companion will be able to improve our knowledge of the inclination and the kinematics of the system .",
    "the rather unusual nature of the system as described raises the issue of appropriate system component names",
    ". the reader will have noticed that we have thus far avoided assigning a name to the companion .",
    "the nomenclature of such systems is as complex as the system itself , an example of which is described by @xcite .",
    "one possibility , that uses binary star and exoplanet naming conventions , would be to rename the primary and secondary components of 30  ari  b to 30  ari  ba and 30  ari  bb respectively , leading to a corrected name for the planetary companion of 30  ari  ba  b. the guidelines of the washington multiplicity catalog standard @xcite recommends that the stellar components of 30  ari  b be named 30  ari  ba and 30  ari  bb , leading to a collision with the planet naming convention .",
    "a compromise would be to name the newly - detected companion 30  ari  c ( also advocated by @xcite ) , allowing the planet to remain as 30  ari  bb .",
    "this would avoid having a name - change for the planet change , which is desirable from a literature paper - trail perspective .",
    "we propose to adopt this latter as a provisional naming convention for the system , as also adopted by @xcite .",
    "as it seems that many of the exoplanet host stars are part of binary systems , we can look forward to further discussion and adjustment of names and orbital parameters in the years ahead .",
    "the authors would like to thank elliott horch , steve howell , and suvrath mahadevan for several useful discussions .",
    "thanks are also due to the anonymous referee whose helpful comments improved the manuscript .",
