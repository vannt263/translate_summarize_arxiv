    "one has almost everywhere @xmath51 , so the temperature gradient acts usually as the main drive for both the radial particle and energy flux . for ions ,",
    "the three coefficients @xmath52 are somewhat closer , and the ion temperature is rather flat , so also the density gradient and the radial electric field are responsible for the radial fluxes . + the low - density plasma has a hollow density profile and a peaked electron temperature profile , with a central value around 1@xmath53kev , see fig .",

    "but also a negative electric field ( ion root ) is able to bring ion transport to the electron level , via reduction of the radial excursions of trapped ions . at these conditions , electrons are the _ rate - controlling _ species ( i.e. , the ion radial flux is reduced to the electron level ) , and the particle flux is driven by the density and electron temperature gradients",

    "this general behaviour is consistent with that obtained in calculations for similar magnetic configurations of tj - ii  @xcite and to the experimental data from hibp  @xcite .    for a wide range of radial positions , @xmath66 ,",
    "the radial fluxes are very slowly decreasing ( almost constant ) functions of @xmath46 .",
    "this happens because the ions , which are the rate controlling species , are driven by a radial electric field with low shear , @xmath67 .",
    "a jump to higher fluxes may be observed for @xmath68 in fig .",
    "[ fig_fluxes_ld ] , and thus a minimum of the radial fluxes at @xmath40 , the point of maximum density and temperature gradients .",
    "the jump can also be seen in the thermal coefficients , see fig .",
    "[ fig_thermalld ] : it corresponds to the change of electron to ion root and it reflects the difference in the drift - orbit size for the two different absolute values of the radial electric field .",

    "@xcite and references therein ) but no simultaneous accumulation of energy has been detected .    during this low - density transition , a double poloidal - velocity shear layer has been measured near the edge  @xcite .",
    "although the formation of this layer is caused by anomalous transport , once the profiles are set the static electric field may be discussed in terms of neoclassical fluxes : the electron temperature ( and thus the thermal transport coefficients ) drops much faster than the ion temperature in the range @xmath69 , and this requires a negative shear to maintain ambipolarity ; the opposite happens for @xmath70 , hence the positive shear in our calculation .",
    "+ for nbi plasmas , the electron temperature is flatter and lower , since the plasma has reached the ech - cutoff density .",
    "the ion temperature is still flat , and slightly higher due to the nbi heating .",

    "the solution of the ambipolar equation for these plasmas is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_amb3dnbi ] .",
    "the situation is similar to that of the ech plasma near the edge : the radial ion flux , being larger , is reduced via @xmath73 to the electron level , which is in turn determined by the density and electron temperature gradients .",
    "the radial fluxes are maximum where the density and ion temperature gradients are larger .",

    "it is therefore meaningful to allow for variations in the ion temperature profile in the neoclassical transport calculations .",
    "if @xmath74 were slightly higher and more peaked than the @xmath74 employed so far , no qualitative effects would be expected in ech plasmas , since @xmath2 is determined by the electron temperature",
    ". the ambipolar flux , being the ions the rate - controlling species , would probably be slightly larger .",

    "their main global parameters are shown in table  [ tab_conf ] .",
    "the rotational transform at the magnetic axis varies about a 20% during the scan ( and so does at the edge , since the profile shape is kept unchanged ) .",

    "[ fig_fourier ] , we can expect the collisional transport of these configurations to be quite similar .",
    "nevertheless , modulation of the toroidal mirror term @xmath77 allows for optimization of radial transport in elongated configurations ( see e.g. ref  @xcite ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an _ effective toroidal curvature _ was defined , including @xmath76 and @xmath77 , in order to account for this effect .",
