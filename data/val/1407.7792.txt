    "it is positive for all values of the anisotropic parameter @xmath49 except for the range @xmath141 . in this range @xmath142",
    "becomes negative .",
    "the jerk parameter decreases with the increase in the anisotropic parameter up to @xmath143 and then increases . for an isotropic case with @xmath50 ,",
    "the jerk parameter becomes @xmath144 in conformity with the prediction from @xmath3cdm model . in the present model ,",
    "since the anisotropic parameter is constrained to be in the range @xmath115 , @xmath142 can take values less than one encompassing values from both the positive and negative domain .",
    "it is worth to mention here that the exact determination of the jerk parameter requires the observation of supernovae of redshift greater than one which is presently a difficult task and therefore , current observational data invoking type ia supernovae are not able to pin down the value or the sign of the jerk parameter .",
    "if observational data from other sources such as cmb and bao can provide a good estimate of the cosmological parameters i.e deceleration parameter and jerk parameter , then accordingly it is possible to constrain the anisotropic parameter @xmath49 to a more tighter range .",
    "[ [ section-16 ] ]    the universe is not only expanding but the expansion is accelerating .",
    "the reason behind the acceleration is not yet known to a satisfactory extent . in the present work ,",
    "we have investigated the role of magnetic field in presence of cloud of cosmic strings pervading the world sheet to get accelerating models . for this purpose",
    ", we considered plane symmetric cosmological models in the frame work of barber s self creation cosmology . in order to get determinate cosmological models we have assumed a linear relationship between the directional hubble parameters which envisages an anisotropic relationship among the directional scale factors . in an earlier work @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that a linear relationship among the directional hubble parameters will not be able to predict the observational facts concerning the accelerating phase of the universe .",
    "however , in the present work , we get accelerating models even if we consider such anisotropic relationship",
    ". this type of behaviour may be due to the presence of magnetic field or due to the nature of scalar field . in the absence of magnetic field",
    ", the deceleration parameter comes out to be positive for all possible values of anisotropic parameter whereas in presence of magnetic field the deceleration parameter can be negative for a range of anisotropic parameter implying an accelerating universe .",
    "even if it is not possible to extract an estimate of the order of contribution from magnetic field in our model , it can be assessed that , magnetic field plays some interesting role in the cosmic dynamics",
    ". however , incorporation of dark energy components into the field equations in the form of a time varying cosmological constant hides the role of magnetic field .",
    "basing upon the experimental values of deceleration parameter , we have tried to constrain the anisotropic parameter @xmath49 for geometric string case within a very narrow range . in future ,",
    "if the deceleration parameter and the jerk parameter can be determined from observations with acceptable accuracy , then we hope , from our simple model , the spatial anisotropy in the form of anisotropic parameter can be well pinned down .",
