    "vibro - impacting systems belong to a very interesting and important class of nonsmooth and nonlinear dynamical systems dibernardo2008,luo2006,awrejcewicz2003,filippov1988  with important technological applications stronge2000,mehta1994,knudsen1992,wiercigroch2008 .",
    "dynamics of such systems can be extremely complicated due to velocity discontinuity arising upon impacts .",
    "a very characteristic feature of such systems is the presence of nonstandard bifurcations such as border - collisions and grazing impacts which often lead to complex chaotic motions .",
    "the poincar map , describing evolution from an impact to the next impact , is a natural tool to study vibro - impacting systems .",
    "the main difficulty with investigating impacting systems is in finding instant of the next impact what typically involves solving a nonlinear equation .",
    "however , the problem can be simplified in the case of a bouncing ball dynamics assuming a special motion of the limiter . in the present paper",
    "we investigate motion of a material point in a gravitational field colliding with a limiter moving with piecewise constant velocity .",
    "this class of models has been extensively studied , see @xcite  and references therein . as a motivation that inspired this work ,",
    "we mention study of physics and transport of granular matter @xcite .",
    "a similar model has been also used to describe the motion of railway bogies @xcite .",
    "therefore it can be expected that some of the present results may cast light on the dynamics in such systems . on the other hand , simple motion of the limiter",
    "makes analytical explorations possible , cf . our preliminary report okninski2009 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 a one dimensional dynamics of a ball moving in a gravitational field and colliding with a table is considered and poincar map is described for piecewise linear motion of the table . in section 3",
    "transition to chaotic dynamics from periodic motion is described .",
    "the nature of mixing leading to chaotic dynamics is described in section 4 . in sections 5 and 6 homoclinic structures responsible for mixing are determined and computed .",
    "finally , we discuss our results in the last section .",
    "we consider a motion of a small ball moving vertically in a gravitational field and colliding with a moving table , representing unilateral constraints .",
    "the ball is treated as a material point while the limiter s mass is assumed so large that its motion is not affected at impacts .",
    "a motion of the ball between impacts is described by the newton s law of motion:@xmath0where @xmath1 and motion of the limiter is:@xmath2with a known function @xmath3 .",
    "we shall also assume that @xmath3 is a continuous function of time .",
    "impacts are modeled as follows : @xmath4where duration of an impact is neglected with respect to time of motion between impacts . in eqs .",
    "( [ position ] ) , ( [ velocity ] ) @xmath5 stands for time of the @xmath6-th impact while @xmath7 , @xmath8are left - sided and right - sided limits of @xmath9 for @xmath10 , respectively , and @xmath11 is the coefficient of restitution , @xmath12 @xcite .    solving eq .",
    "( [ point motion ] ) and applying impact conditions ( position ) , ( [ velocity ] ) we derive the poincar map @xcite : @xmath13where @xmath14 . the limiter s motion has been typically assumed in form @xmath15 , cf . @xcite and references therein .",
    "this choice leads to serious difficulties in solving the first of eqs.([yv ] ) for @xmath16 , thus making analytical investigations of dynamics hardly possible .",
    "accordingly , we have decided to simplify the limiter s periodic motion to make ( [ yv ] ) solvable .",
    "let us thus assume that the table moves up with a finite constant velocity @xmath17 and then goes down with a finite constant velocity @xmath18 aobr2009 .",
    "therefore , displacement of the table is the following periodic function of time : @xmath19with @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the floor function  the largest integer less than or equal to @xmath24 .",
    "our model consists thus of equations ( [ yv ] ) , ( [ displacement ] ) with control parameters @xmath11 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 . since the period of motion of the limiter is equal to one , the map ( [ yv ] ) is invariant under the translation @xmath27 .",
    "accordingly , all impact times @xmath28 can be reduced to the unit interval @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "in our recent article periodic solutions of eqs .",

    "( [ yv ] ) , ( [ displacement ] ) becomes complicated when some impacts occur in time interval @xmath30 , and some in @xmath31 .    in the case of two impacts per period a @xmath32 - cycle ,",
    "@xmath33 , @xmath34 , is stable .",
    "next , for increasing values of @xmath25 , period doubling takes place and @xmath35 - cycle with impacts @xmath36 , @xmath37 is formed .",
    "then , upon further increase of @xmath25 , the period doubling scenario ends abruptly when @xmath38 . for @xmath39",
    "this happens for @xmath40 .",
    "this critical transition is investigated in sections 4 , 5 .",
    "equations for dynamics after the first period doubling have the following form :    @xmath41    @xmath42{fig1.eps}\\ ] ]    in fig .",
    "1 transition to chaos is shown .",
    "the initial dynamical state with two impacts per period bifurcates at @xmath43 ( this value can be computed analytically , see @xcite ) . for @xmath44 time of the second impact tends to @xmath45 and this mode of dynamics is impossible for @xmath46 .",
    "it turns out that for @xmath47 there are two attractors : a noisy , probably chaotic , attractor coexisting with a @xmath48cycle which appears just before the transition . at @xmath49 the noisy",
    "attractor disappears and is substituted by a more irregular attractor , see figs .",
    "full circles indicate positions of small clouds of points . we have studied these potentially chaotic attractors in detail .",
    "first of all , we have checked numerically that the attractors are non  periodic .",
    "indeed , computations show that after @xmath50 iterations the points generated by the map ( [ yv ] ) , ( [ displacement ] ) stay on the corresponding attractor and do not repeat .",
    "we have also computed lyapunov exponents for both attractors . in the case of the attractor shown in fig .",
    "2 the lyapunov exponent is @xmath51 while for the attractor in fig . 3 @xmath52 .",
    "it follows that in both cases dynamics is chaotic and is more mixing in the second case .",
    "the mechanism of mixing is explained in the next section .",

    "mixing can arise due to corner events @xcite when impacts occur at points where motion of the limiter loses smoothness at time instances @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "let us investigate the second possibility more closely . in fig .",
    "4 the stable @xmath56 - cycle with four impacts per two periods : @xmath36 , @xmath37 and unstable @xmath32 - cycle are shown schematically .",

    "therefore , a small neighborhood of @xmath60 is a union of two sets , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 are small and positive , see fig .",
    "@xmath53{fig5.eps}\\ ] ]    now , let @xmath63 .",
    "it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ yv ] ) , ( [ displacement ] ) that time of the next impact , @xmath16 , as well as the corresponding post  impact velocity , @xmath64 , depend discontinuously on @xmath28 . in other words",
    ", we get different solutions , @xmath65 , depending on whether @xmath66 or @xmath67 .",
    "it follows that mixing will necessarily be present if a trajectory recurrently visits the interval @xmath68 .",
    "we shall study this possibility in the next section .",
    "let us consider critical case : @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "this is described by eq .",
    "( equations ) with four impacts per two periods such that @xmath71 , @xmath72:@xmath73where we have substituted @xmath74 and the periodicity conditions : @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",

    "now it follows that necessary conditions for existence of this solution can be formulated .",

    "@xmath53{fig6.eps}\\ ] ]    the solution of eq .",
    "( [ hom1 ] ) is unstable and leads to a homoclinic  type orbit and thus can be referred to as the homoclinic cycle ( see devaney2003 for the definition of a homoclinic point and a homoclinic orbit ) .",
    "indeed , for the initial condition @xmath104 the orbit is attracted by the @xmath35 - cycle @xmath105 , while for @xmath106 the fixed point @xmath107 is repelling , but the orbit returns eventually to the @xmath35 - cycle ( provided that a coexisting attractor does not capture the trajectory ) .",
    "we shall compute the repelling branch in the next section .",
