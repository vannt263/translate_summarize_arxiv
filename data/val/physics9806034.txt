    "many applications such as electronic structure calculations require an efficient method to solve discretized linear differential equations which are generators of long range interactions , such as poisson s equation . in modern electronic structure calculations , except those using planewaves , solving poisson s equation takes up a significant amount of computational time .",

    "could provide a very powerful method to solve discretized linear differential equations .",
    "this present research aims to unify these approaches for use in a wide range of applications , especially in electronic structure calculations , where all of the aforementioned approaches prove to be very beneficial in various stages of the calculations individually .",
    "a basis set that combines wavelet theory with finite element analysis exists and is known as the interpolet basis ( interpolets is based upon deslauriers and dubuc scaling functions [ 4 ] , which play the role of both scaling functions and interpolets in the interpolet basis . see also [ 5 ] ) .",

    "multigrid is based upon a basic iterative method , which is then applied over a sequence of scales in order to improve the convergence rate .",
    "one such iterative method used for this purpose is the _ weighted jacobi method _ , which provides the following recursion , @xmath4 here , @xmath5 is an appropriate weight ( usually chosen to be @xmath6 ) , @xmath7 is the initial guess , @xmath8 is the diagonal matrix composed of the diagonal elements of @xmath1 , and @xmath9 is the _ residual _ at step @xmath10 , defined as @xmath11 .",

    "relaxation_.    multigrid exploits this basic iterative method in a multiscale fashion through the following procedure .",

    "( note that , as discussed in the appendix , the exact solution to the error equation , when summed with the current iterative solution @xmath16 , yields the exact solution to the problem @xmath2 . ) the procedure of passing up the residual to successively coarser scales continues until a predetermined coarsest scale @xmath10 is reached . at this coarsest scale @xmath10 ,",

    "this procedure is followed down to the finest scale , relaxing @xmath20 times at each scale @xmath22 with the initial guess @xmath23 , where finally one relaxes @xmath20 times on the original linear equation to obtain an approximate solution to the overall problem .",
    "the procedure described above is the _ v - cycle of the multigrid algorithm_. v - cycles may be repeated in succession to produce a solution of any desired accuracy .",
    "the interpolation and restriction operators should obey two conditions , known as the _ variational properties_. the first condition , the _ galerkin condition _",

    "this is the recipe for the restriction operator , up to an overall scalar constant , given the interpolation operator .",
    "in this section , we briefly review interpolet theory based on the discussion in lippert , arias and edelman [ 1 ] .    in interpolet theory , functions varying slowly over integer length scales can be closely approximated as linear combinations of interpolating functions , @xmath27 where the @xmath28 are the expansion coefficients and the @xmath29 are functions with compact support , also known as _",
    "interpolets are a basis set combining wavelet theory with finite element analysis . in place of the orthonormality condition common in wavelet theory , interpolets have cardinality and interpolation from finite element analysis as their characteristic properties .",

    "note that the @xmath41 case gives the familiar linear interpolation procedure . and that the @xmath42 case is distinct from the interpolation given by traditional cubic @xmath43splines .",
    "interpolet theory thereby provides guidance in selecting natural interpolation operators for use in the multigrid algorithm .",
    "@xmath44 @xmath45    in addition to properties from finite element analysis , interpolets satisfy the central condition of wavelet theory ,",
    "the _ two - scale relation_. this relation states that every coarse scale interpolet is expressible as a linear combination of finer scale interpolets .",
    "interpolets therefore interpolate themselves _ exactly _",
    ", @xmath46 here , the @xmath47 is the coarse scale interpolet , the @xmath48 are fine scale interpolets , and the @xmath49 are the expansion coefficients .",
    "( note that from the cardinality property , we have that the @xmath49 are just the values of the interpolet at the half - integers @xmath50 . ) the significance of this condition is to ensure that a basis made from interpolets of varying scales always provides a very uniform description of space .",

    "these values may be computed from the previous @xmath54 by appropriate change of integration variable and application of the two scale relation .",
    "multiplying a vector by this mra matrix may be performed using one of two different methods .",
    "the first is straight forward multiplication by the matrix @xmath55 .",
    "because of the density of the mra matrix mentioned above , the number of flops required to apply the operator within the method grows faster than linearly with the size of the problem .",
    "the second approach uses the two - scale relation to reduce the number of operations so that the effort in the matrix multiplication scales only linearly with the size of the problem [ 1 ] .",

    "the hopgrid proceesure is superior to the traditional multigrid algorithm .",
    "when the convergence rates of these two algorithms are compared in terms of @xmath57 per mflops , as in figure [ compare]b , we find that despite the increased density of the mra matrix ( by about a factor of ten ) , the two methods give comparable results on a uniform grid .",
    "next we investigate the dependence of these convergence rates on problem size . in terms of @xmath57 per @xmath58 ,",
    "figure [ convrate]a shows that although the convergence rate of the traditional multigrid algorithm remains nearly constant , the convergence rate of the hopgrid algorithm _ increases _ with increasing problem size . figure",
    "[ convrate]b shows that even for the uniform case , the efficiency of the hopgrid algorithm overcomes the increased complexity of the mra matrix and results in nearly the same convergence rate as the traditional method in terms of a direct floating point operations comparison .",
    "it is in the case of non - uniform grids , where the application of the mra matrix requires far fewer operations , where we expect the maximum from the new algorithm ,",
    "in this research , our aim was to develop a new algorithm that benefits from the best combination of a variety of approaches , in particular the multigrid algorithm , multiresolution analysis from wavelet theory , and finite element analysis .",
    "the application for the new algorithm which we have in mind is the numerical solution of problems involving long - range interactions where an underlying interpolet basis with its multiresolution properties is needed .",
    "we have shown that the interpolet theory , based upon multiresolution analysis from wavelet theory and interpolation properties from finite element theory , provides a natural and unique choice of interpolation and restriction operators and an underlying grid for the multigrid algorithm .",
    "then we showed how the operations of restriction and interpolation may be carried out efficiently , without the application of linear operators , by exploiting the properties of an mra basis .",
    "finally , we introduced the hopgrid algorithm , which draws upon these results to produce a multigrid - like method to solve discretized linear equations in problems expressed in multiresolution wavelet bases .",
    "we have seen that the convergence rate of the new algorithm in terms of work units is superior to that of the traditional multigrid apprach and that , even in the worse - case scenario of a uniform problem , the new algorithm performs as well as the traditional approach on a direct floating point operation basis despite the increase complexity of mra matrices .",

    "relaxation_.    the weighted jacobi method and similar basic iterative methods rapidly eliminate high frequency errors while leaving the smooth components of the error mostly unaffected .",
    "this is called the _ smoothing property_. the reason for this behavior can be explained when we look at the eigenvalues of the convergence operator @xmath71 .",
    "the eigenvalues of this operator determine how fast the error converges to zero .",
    "[ wjaceval ] shows that the eigenvalues of the convergence operator for the weighted jacobi method lie in various ranges .",
    "the bands are chosen for illustration purposes and an explanation for these choices are given in the main body of the paper .",
    "the errors that are multiplied by the eigenvalues in the slow convergence band correspond to eigenvectors varying slowly in space . because the convergence operator @xmath72 does not eliminate efficiently most of these low frequency errors , this basic iterative method approach the exact solution very slowly .",
    "a more efficient method would eliminate all the error modes at equal rates .",
    "the multigrid algorithm has this feature and produces a solution that approaches the analytic solution with a higher convergence rate .",
    "the transition from the weighted jacobi method to the multigrid algorithm is made by improving upon the basic jacobi method .",
    "one way to improve the efficiency of weighted jacobi relaxations is to start with a better initial guess .",
    "conceptually , one can do this by solving the problem on a spatially coarser scale and using this solution as the initial guess for the original problem .",
    "this procedure is referred to as _ coarse grid correction _ ( cgc ) . on the coarse scale , there are fewer grid points , and on this grid the smooth error modes from the fine scale now appear higher frequency modes . replacing the original problem with a smaller one of mostly high frequency errors",
    "allows the application of the weighted jacobi method to solve the problem more efficiently .",
    "this way , the convergence rate for the total error is accelerated since both the high and the low frequency error modes are eliminated on the fine and the coarse scales .",

    "the residual calculated on this scale is then transferred to the next coarser scale using a linear operator @xmath75 , known as the _ restriction operator_. in general , @xmath76 takes a vector from a fine scale @xmath22 , and transfers it to the next coarse scale @xmath77 .",
    "( this operator is discussed later in the appendix . ) for the restriction step , we assume that the relaxation on the finest scale has eliminated most of the high frequency error components , which lie in the null - space of restriction , so that little information is lost in the restriction process .",

    "we could add this error to @xmath74 to obtain an approximate solution for the fine scale problem , since @xmath82 , as previously explained .",
    "however , the multigrid algorithm continues to go down to coarser scales and uses cgc to find solutions for the error equations at each coarser scale to improve the convergence rate . following this prescription , we compute the residual on scale @xmath83 and transfer it to the next coarser scale , using the restriction procedure described .",
