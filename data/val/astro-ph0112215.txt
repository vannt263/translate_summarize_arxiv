    "1h  0419 - 577 ( also known as lb  1727 , 1es  0425 - 573 and iras  f04250 - 5718 ) is a radio - quiet seyfert galaxy , with a @xmath2 flux of 0.18  jy and an apparent magnitude of 14.1 .",
    "it is a moderate redshift object ( _ z _ @xmath3 ) and relatively bright x - ray source which has been observed over recent years by _ asca _ , _ rosat _ and _",
    "bepposax_. 1h  0419 - 577 was also one of the brightest seyfert galaxies detected in the extreme ultra - violet by the _ rosat _ wide field camera ( pye 1995 ) and _ euve _ ( marshall , fruscione & carone 1995 ) .",
    "optical spectra taken over the same period in 1996 as the _ asca _ and _ bepposax _ x - ray observations ( guainazzi 1998 ) show 1h  0419 - 577 to be a typical broad - line seyfert 1 , in accordance with the classification by brissenden ( 1989 ) .    over the 210  kev band",
    ", seyfert galaxies can usually be modelled by a power law , with photon - index @xmath0 @xmath4 .",
    "below about 1 kev a ` soft excess ' is often reported , although the limited bandwidth and resolution of previous missions have made it difficult to distinguish a soft _ emission _",
    "component from the effects of absorption by ionised matter . in the case of 1h  0419 - 577 ,",
    "turner ( 1999 ) did conclude that there is a soft emission component on the basis of simultaneous _ rosat _ hri and _ asca _ observations .",
    "however , those authors found the 210  kev power law to be unusually flat , with @xmath0 @xmath5 , and to extend down to 0.7  kev .",
    "the _ bepposax _ observation of 1h  0419@xmath6577 in 1996 september ( guainazzi 1998 ) also found an unusually flat power law ( over 310 kev ) of @xmath0 @xmath7 , but provided no independent soft x - ray data , due to technical problems with the low energy concentrator spectrometer ( lecs ) .",
    "the link between the hard x - ray power law and a soft x - ray emission component is critical in the context of the accretion disc / corona model for agn , where the hard x - ray emission is explained by comptonisation of optical / euv photons from the disc by energetic electrons in an overlying corona ( e.g. , haardt & maraschi 1991 ) . in this model",
    "the energy balance between the soft photon flux and the corona then determines the hardness of the spectrum in the 210  kev band .",
    "the soft excess may be the tail of the big blue bump , representing the thermal emission from an accretion disc surrounding the central black hole ( shields 1979 ; czerny & elvis 1987 ; ross & fabian 1993 ) .    in our _ xmm - newton _ observation , reported here , we find a strong and broad soft emission component ( consistent with an earlier _ rosat _ pspc observation in 1992 ; guainazzi 1998 ) and a 210  kev power law continuum slope typical of seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "we discuss our result in terms of the stronger soft photon flux cooling the coronal electrons , with a resulting steepening of the power law , and suggest it represents direct observational support for the disc / corona model for the hard x - ray emission from radio - quiet agn .",
    "in that general class of models , back - irradiation of the accretion disc by the hard x - ray flux can result in additional features being imprinted on the emerging x - ray spectrum .",
    "the most obvious of these ` reflection ' features ( pounds 1990 ; nandra & pounds 1994 ) is often an emission line at 6.4  kev arising from fluorescence in near - neutral fe .",
    "this line has emerged as a powerful diagnostic of the inner regions in agn since _ asca _",
    "observations found it to be broadened and red - shifted ( tanaka 1995 ; nandra 1997a , b ) .",
    "early observations from _ xmm - newton _ have shown a rather different situation to apply in several high - luminosity seyferts ( similar to 1h  0419 - 577 ) , with a weaker and higher energy ( ionised ) broad fe - k line , resolved from a narrow line at 6.4  kev ( eg .",
    "reeves 2001 ; pounds 2001 ) .",
    "the latter component , interpreted as scattering from neutral matter distant from the hard x - ray source ( e.g. , in the molecular torus ) , is emerging as a common feature in agn observations by _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra_.    in previous observations of 1h  0419 - 577 turner ( 1999 ) found evidence for an emission line in the _ asca _ data at 6.39  kev , with equivalent width ( ew ) of 700  @xmath8  400  ev ( data from august 1996 ) .",
    "a line is not detected in the _ sax _ data ( guainazzi 1998 ) , but with a rather high upper limit of @xmath9  250  ev for the equivalent width .    in section  [ sec : xmmobs ] the data from _ xmm - newton _ are summarised , followed by the data analysis in section  [ sec : specanal ] .",
    "comparisons with the _ rosat _ , _ asca _ and _ bepposax _ observations are reviewed in section  [ sec : otherobs ] .",
    "note that all fit parameters are given for the rest frame of the agn , with values of @xmath10  =  50 km  s@xmath11  mpc@xmath11 and @xmath12  =  0 assumed throughout .",
    "errors are quoted at the 90% confidence level ( @xmath13  = 2.7 for 1 interesting parameter ) .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ observation of 1h  0419@xmath6577 took place on 4th december 2000 and lasted for just over 8  ks . because of a co - ordinate error , x - ray data were only obtained from the epic pn camera ( strder 2001 ) .",
    "the pn data were reduced with the _ xmm _ sas ( science analysis software ) , using epchain to produce the event list .",
    "this was further filtered using xmmselect within the sas .",
    "both single and double pixel events ( patterns 0 - 4 in xmmselect ) were selected , with the low energy cut - off being set to 200 ev .",
    "the spectrum was extracted within a box - shaped region of size 20 by 10 pixels ( corresponds to ( 87  @xmath14  43.5 )  arcsec ) .",
    "the xspec v11.0 software package was used to analyse the background subtracted spectrum , using the most recent response matrices .",
    "( the spectrum was first binned , using the ftool command _ grppha _ , to provide a minimum of 20 counts per bin . )",
    "since no significant changes occured in the x - ray flux over the 8000  second observation , the summed data were used in modelling the spectrum .",
    "the spectral analysis was begun in the conventional way , comparing the data for 1h  0419 - 577 with a range of parametric models until the best reduced @xmath15 value was obtained .",
    "first , a single absorbed power law ( @xmath16 fixed to the galactic value of @xmath17 @xmath18 ) was tried , but found to be a very poor fit across the full 0.210  kev band ( @xmath19 ) , mainly due to a strong upward curvature in the measured spectrum .",
    "constraining the model to the 210  kev band , however , provided a good fit for a photon - index @xmath0  @xmath20 , with @xmath21 .",
    "a gaussian component was then added to the model but yielded no significant detection of either a narrow or a broad fe line . at a rest energy of 6.4  kev ( appropriate to neutral iron emission ) ,",
    "the equivalent width of a narrow line ( @xmath22  =  10  ev ) was @xmath23  85  ev while for a broad neutral line ( @xmath22  =  300  ev ) the upper limit was @xmath23  130  ev .",
    "for an ionised line at 6.7  kev the corresponding broad line limit was @xmath23  120  ev .",
    "we note these upper limits are consistent with the weak fe emission lines detected in objects of similar luminosity ( reeves 2001 , pounds 2001 ) .    extrapolating the above 210 kev power law fit down to 0.2  kev revealed a strong and broad ( ` hot ' ) soft excess ( fig  [ pn_softexcess ] ) .",
    "the soft excess was then modelled by the addition of blackbody emission , the breadth of the excess requiring 3 blackbody components to match the observed spectrum ( fig  [ pn_unfolded ] ) .",
    "details of this fit are given as fit 4 of table 1 .",
    "the soft excess has no obvious superimposed absorption features , the limits for the optical depths of the o  vii and o  viii edges being @xmath24  0.12 and @xmath24  0.06 respectively .",
    "a small excess of counts at @xmath25  kev could be a calibration residual , although emission from the o  vii triplet has been previously identified , close to this energy , in objects of similar luminosity ( e.g. , mrk 359 ( obrien 2001 ) , mrk 509 ( pounds 2001 ) ) . without the benefit of rgs data , we can not investigate this further .",
    "the measured flux of 1h  0419 - 577 at 210  kev was 1.12  @xmath14  10@xmath26  erg  @xmath18  s@xmath11 , corresponding to a luminosity of 5.67  @xmath14  10@xmath27  erg  s@xmath11 , with a flux of 2.88  @xmath14  10@xmath26  erg  @xmath18  s@xmath11 over the full 0.210  kev band ( 1.91  @xmath14  10@xmath28  erg  s@xmath11 ) , including the strong soft excess.    ( ; 0cm)figs / pn_softexcess.ps    ( ; 0cm)figs / pn_euf.ps    .fits to the _ xmm - newton _ data from 2000 december .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ fitcomparisons ]    ( ; 0cm)figs / pn+asca+rosat_euf.ps    the pn spectrum was then re - fitted over the 0.510  kev _ asca _ band , so that the _ asca _ and _ xmm - newton _ data could be compared directly . over this band ,",
    "the pn data are well fitted with a power law and only 2 blackbody components .",
    "each _ asca _",
    "observation was then modelled in this way , with the bb temperatures and relative normalisations frozen to the values determined from the _ xmm _ data , since the soft excess is not well constrained for the _ asca _ datasets .",
    "the results of this fit ( fit 5 ) are given in table  2 .",
    "the 0.52  kev flux is a factor of @xmath29 higher in the _ xmm - newton _ observation and the power law is much steeper ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the power law slope and soft excess change in the same sense , but to a lesser degree , between the two _ asca _ observations , with the soft flux increasing by 42% from july to august 1996 according to fit 5 , in excellent agreement with the @xmath31% increase in count - rate recorded by the _ rosat _ hri data ( turner 1999 ) .    since only the data from the mecs instrument onboard _",
    "bepposax _ were available , bb components could not be constrained for that observation .",
    "the power law slope is 1.63  @xmath8  0.04 , implying that the slope was continuing to steepen , as hinted at between the _ asca _ observations .    to compare the flux between _ rosat _ and _ xmm _ , a simple power law was fitted to the _ rosat _ and pn datasets , over the range 0.22.0  kev , with @xmath16 fixed to the galactic value . for _ rosat",
    "_ , @xmath0 @xmath32 , while the pn slope was slightly less steep , at @xmath0 @xmath33 .",
    "this corresponds to a flux over the 0.22  kev band of 3.42  @xmath14  10@xmath26  erg  @xmath18  s@xmath11 for _ rosat _ , compared to 1.76  @xmath14  10@xmath26  erg  @xmath18  s@xmath11 as measured by _",
    "xmm_. we stress that a single power law is not a good fit to either the _ rosat _ or _ xmm _ data , both of which show evidence for a more complex soft excess .",
    "it has been noted by a number of authors ( e.g. , turner 1993 ; iwasawa , brandt & fabian 1998 ) that the _ rosat _ pspc spectral indices are up to 0.4 steeper than those found from other missions . allowing for these uncertainties ,",
    "we consider that the _ rosat _ pspc observation of 1992 is consistent with the soft excess at that time being as strong as in the 2000 december _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "the next step was to compare the _ asca _ , _ sax _ and _ xmm _ data to search for neutral iron emission .",
    "we found no evidence for a narrow line ( @xmath22  =  10  ev ) in any of the observations .",
    "the july 1996 _ asca _ data gave an equivalent width of @xmath23  81  ev , very similar to our _ xmm _ upper limit .",
    "the august _ asca _ and september _ bepposax _ data yielded upper limits of @xmath9140  ev .",
    "broad line fits ( width 300  ev ) also gave only upper limits of order @xmath23  350  ev for the july _ asca _ and september _ bepposax _ data , while for the august _ asca _ data the fit did show a decrease in @xmath34 of 7 for 1 additional degree of freedom ( a confidence level of greater than 99% ) .",
    "this line , if real , has an ew of 335  @xmath8  210  ev .",
    "summarising , the august 1996 _ asca _ data suggest that a broad iron line may exist , although none of the other observations detected such emission .",
    "it is known that the low energy response of the _ asca _ sis has been degrading and that this leads to an underestimate of the soft x - ray flux . in order to estimate the decrease in the low energy efficiency of _ asca _ in the 1h  0419 - 577 observation",
    ", we used the formula given in the _ asca _ gof calibration memo ( yaqoob 2000 ) , which quotes the effective increase in n@xmath35 as a function of time .",
    "the net effect of this in our fits is a change of @xmath0@xmath36 in the spectral slope .",
    "this does not , therefore , alter our conclusions about the change in state of 1h  0419 - 577 between the _ asca _ and _ xmm _ observations .",
    "our _ xmm - newton _ observation of 1h  0419 - 577 found the source in a bright / soft state .",
    "the overall 0.210  kev spectrum is very similar to that of 2 other luminous seyfert galaxies recently observed with _ xmm - newton _ , mrk 205 ( reeves 2001 ) and mrk 509 ( pounds 2001 ) , exhibiting a typical 210  kev power law slope and strong soft excess . however , the new observation of 1h  0419 - 577 contrasts markedly with both _",
    "asca _ and _ bepposax _ spectra obtained in 1996 , where the 210  kev continuum was significantly flatter , and the soft excess much weaker .",
    "we suggest the strong soft excess in our recent observation is the key to the overall spectral change , with increased cooling of the coronal electrons yielding a steeper / softer hard power law component .",
    "interestingly , it seems possible that this effect was already apparent between the 2 _ asca _ observations a month apart in 1996 , with an increase in the _ rosat _ hri flux of at least 40% , and the best fit 210  kev power law slopes increasing from 1.35  @xmath8  0.05 to 1.42  @xmath8  0.06 ( see also turner 1999 ) .",
    "if the 2000 december spectral state is considered ` normal ' for a bls1 then , in the framework of the disc / corona model , we can attribute the unusually flat / hard 210  kev continuum in the 1996 observations to a lack of soft photons ( ` photon starved ' comptonisation ) .    in order to quantify such a change",
    "we have tried a comptonisation fit to the data ( _ comptt _ in xspec ) , using a model ( as in obrien 2001 ) in which soft photons from the accretion disc are up - scattered by thermal electrons characterised by two temperatures , to yield the observed broad soft excess and the harder power law respectively . for the _ xmm - newton _ data we assumed an input photon distribution of kt  =  20  ev ( appropriate to thermal radiation from the inner disc of a 10@xmath37 @xmath38 black hole ) .    for the _ xmm - newton _ data we obtained an acceptable fit ( @xmath39 ) across the full 0.210 kev spectrum with a ` cool ' comptonising component of kt  =  2.5  @xmath8  0.1 kev and optical depth of @xmath40  =  3.9  @xmath8  0.1 , together with a ` hot ' component of kt  =  95  @xmath8  15 kev and @xmath40  =  1.0  @xmath8  0.1 ( figure  [ comptt ] ) .",
    "the same double - comptonisation model was then compared with the _ asca _ data from the 1996 july observation . again",
    "an acceptable fit was obtained , with comptonising components of kt  =  2.5  @xmath8  0.1 kev with an optical depth of @xmath40  =  3.5  @xmath8  0.1 ( and much smaller normalisation ) and kt  =  168  @xmath41 kev ( @xmath40  =  1.0  @xmath8  0.1 ) .",
    "while the individual parameters should not be taken too literally , since there is a close coupling of temperature and optical depth , the fits support the view that the steepening of the power law between the 1996 and 2000 observations of 1h  0419 - 577 follows a significant cooling of the hot comptonising electrons .",
    "this is consistent with the much stronger soft x - ray flux detected in the _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "finally we note that the relatively short exposure of the _ xmm _ observation means that the limits on the fe k lines are not very severe .",
    "however , it might be expected that any broad line would be weakened if the disc had an optically thick , ionised skin , as our comptonisation model suggests .    ( ; 0cm)figs / comptt.ps",
    "a new measurement of the x - ray spectrum of the luminous seyfert 1 galaxy 1h 0419 - 577 with _ xmm - newton _ has shown it to have a strong soft excess and ` normal ' power law slope , very similar to the comparably luminous seyferts mrk 205 and 509 .",
    "no iron line was found , but the upper limits are consistent with the fe - k emission found in _ xmm - newton _ observations of objects of similar luminosity .",
    "a comparison with archival data shows the 210  kev continuum to have been much flatter in 1996 , together with a far weaker soft excess .",
    "we interpret our overall _ xmm - newton _ observation in terms of two - temperature comptonisation of thermal photons from the inner accretion disc , and explain the hard continuum seen in 1996 as being due to ` photon starving ' of the hotter electron component .",
    "we note the spectral changes we have observed in the seyfert galaxy 1h 0419 - 577 are similar to , but smaller than , those seen in the changes in ` state ' for several galactic black hole candidate sources ( e.g. , vilhu 2001 ) .",
    "the work in this paper is mainly based on observations with _ xmm - newton _ , an esa science mission , with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa and nasa .",
    "the authors would like to thank the epic consortium , led by dr m.j.l .",
    "turner , for all their work during the calibration phase , and the soc and ssc teams for making the observation and analysis possible .",
    "this research has also made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administation .",
