    "nuclear physics research has entered a new era with developments of radioactive nuclear beam facilities , where nuclear reactions are the primary probe of the new physics , such as novel structural changes . in those facilities ,",
    "the low - energy nuclear reactions research is highly focused on understanding astrophysically important reaction rates involving exotic nuclei .",
    "these are often weakly - bound with a few - body , cluster structure that can easily be dissociated in their interaction with other nuclei . understanding the breakup mechanism and its impact on nuclear reaction dynamics is essential .",
    "a major consequence of breakup is that a rich scenario of reaction pathways arises , such as events where ( i ) not all the resulting breakup fragments might be captured by the target , termed incomplete fusion ( icf ) , ( ii ) the entire projectile is captured by the target , called complete fusion ( cf ) , and ( iii ) none of the breakup fragments are captured , termed no - capture breakup ( ncbu ) .    since the availability of intense exotic beams is still limited , extensive experimental research",
    "has recently been carried out exploiting intense beams of stable weakly - bound nuclei , such as @xmath0li and @xmath1be @xcite .",
    "understanding the effect of their breakup on near - barrier fusion has been a key aspect of these investigations @xcite .",
    "these have definitively demonstrated that breakup suppresses the above - barrier fusion cross sections .",
    "most recently , experimental activities have been focused on disentangling breakup and competing reaction mechanisms from inclusive and exclusive coincidence measurements @xcite .",
    "one of the challenges is to obtain a complete quantitative understanding of the breakup mechanism and its relationship with near - barrier fusion .",
    "this research is guided by complete sub - barrier breakup measurements @xcite .",
    "theoretical works have addressed the low - energy reaction dynamics of weakly - bound nuclei using quantum mechanical , classical and mixed quantum - classical approaches @xcite . among these",
    ", the continuum - discretised coupled channels ( cdcc ) framework has been very successful @xcite .",
    "however , existing quantum models have limitations @xcite , as they can not calculate integrated icf and cf cross sections unambiguously .",
    "neither , after the formation of icf products , can they follow the evolution of the surviving breakup fragment(s ) since icf results in depletion of the total few - body wave function .",
    "these difficulties are overcome by the three - dimensional classical dynamical reaction model suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite . a crucial _ input _ of this model is a stochastically sampled breakup function proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which can be determined from sub - barrier breakup measurements @xcite .",
    "this function encodes the effects of the coulomb and nuclear interactions that cause the projectile breakup . hence , this approach is _ not _ a breakup model , rather it is a quantitative dynamical model for relating the sub - barrier ncbu to the above - barrier icf and cf of weakly - bound nuclei @xcite . the model has been successfully applied to interpreting fusion measurements of weakly - bound nuclei @xcite , and isomer ratio measurements @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "i report on further developments of this classical dynamical model .",
    "the key new aspect is the time propagation of the surviving breakup fragment and the icf product , allowing the description of their asymptotic angular distribution and dynamical variables .",
    "these should be very useful in ( i ) current experimental activities aimed at disentangling competing reaction mechanisms from asymptotic observables such as alpha - production yields @xcite , ( ii ) interpreting particle-@xmath2-coincidence experiments @xcite , and ( iii ) applications to @xmath2 ray spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the new developments are illustrated with a simplified test case that does _ not _ aim at adjusting any measurements .",
    "it is worth mentioning that various dynamical models have been proposed for multi - fragmentation and icf in heavy - ion induced reactions at energies well - above the coulomb barrier ( @xmath3 mev / nucleon ) , as recently reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this different context , some of those models ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) use concepts and techniques ( e.g. , classical trajectory , monte carlo sampling ) that overlap with some involved in the present model .",
    "the model is explained in section 2 . in section 3 ,",
    "numerical results are discussed , and a summary is given in section 4 .",
    "the main features of the model are as follows :    \\(i ) the target @xmath4 is initially at rest in the origin of the laboratory frame , whilst the weakly - bound ( two - body ) projectile @xmath5 approaches the target ( along the z - axis ) with incident energy @xmath6 and orbital angular momentum @xmath7 . for each @xmath7 ( chosen to be an integer number of @xmath8 ) an _ ensemble _ of @xmath9 incident projectiles",
    "is considered . including the @xmath10 mutual coulomb and nuclear forces , classical equations of motion determine an orbit with a definite distance of closest approach @xmath11 .",
    "\\(ii ) the complexity of the projectile dissociation is empirically encoded in a density of ( local breakup ) probability @xmath12 , a function of the projectile - target separation @xmath13 , such that @xmath14 is the probability of breakup in the interval @xmath13 to @xmath15 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "a key feature is that for a given projectile - target combination , both measurements @xcite and cdcc calculations @xcite indicate that the integral of this breakup probability density along a given classical orbit is an exponential function of its distance of closest approach , @xmath11 : @xmath16 consequently , @xmath12 has the same exponential form , @xmath17 .",
    "( the factor of 2 highlights that breakup may occur along the entrance or exit branch of the trajectory , although the exponential form will clearly place maximum probability of breakup at @xmath18 . ) this function is sampled to determine the position of breakup in the orbit discussed in ( i ) . in this position",
    ", the projectile is instantaneously broken up into fragments f1 and f2 .",
    "these interact with @xmath4 , and with each other , through real central two - body potentials having coulomb barriers @xmath19 at separations @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "\\(iii ) the instantaneous dynamical variables of the excited projectile at breakup , namely its total internal energy @xmath22 , its angular momentum @xmath23 and the separation of the fragments @xmath24 are all monte carlo sampled .",
    "the initial separation @xmath25 between the fragments and its orientation @xmath24 are determined by sampling the radial and angular probability distributions of the projectile ground - state ( g.s . )",
    "wave function , respectively .",
    "for a two - body projectile with @xmath26 g.s . , a very good approximation for calculating @xmath25 is through a gaussian sampling function in the classically allowed region of the fragments , whilst the orientation of @xmath24 is isotropic .",
    "( this will be used in the test case below . ) for high @xmath27 excitations , when there is no barrier between f1 and f2 , @xmath25 is equated with their external turning point .",
    "the orientation of @xmath23 is chosen randomly from all directions orthogonal to @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath27 is sampled uniformly in the interval [ 0,@xmath28 , whilst for @xmath22 an exponentially decreasing function for energies between the top of the barrier ( @xmath29 ) and a chosen maximum @xmath30 is sampled .",
    "both @xmath31 and @xmath30 are increased until convergence of the observables occur .",
    "\\(iv ) having fixed the position and dynamical variables of the excited projectile fragments at the moment of breakup , the instantaneous velocity of the particles f1 , f2 and @xmath4 is determined by conservation of energy , linear momentum and angular momentum in the overall center - of - mass frame ( see appendix b ) . these breakup initial conditions",
    "are transformed to the laboratory frame where the three bodies are propagated in time .",
    "the calculated trajectories of f1 , f2 and @xmath4 determine the number of icf , cf and ncbu events , fragment f@xmath32 being assumed to be captured if the classical trajectories take it within the fragment - target barrier radius @xmath33 .",
    "\\(v ) from the @xmath9 breakup events sampled for each projectile angular momentum @xmath7 , the numbers of events @xmath34 in which @xmath35 0 ( ncbu ) , 1 ( icf ) , or 2 ( cf ) fragments are captured determine the relative yields @xmath36 of these three reaction processes after breakup , with @xmath37 .",
    "the absolute probabilities @xmath38 of these processes are expressed in terms of the relative yields and the integrated breakup probability over the whole trajectory @xmath39 ) : @xmath40\\,h(l_{cr}-l_0 ) \\nonumber\\\\                 & + & p_{bu}(r_{min})\\ , \\widetilde{p_{2 } } , \\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the heaviside step function and @xmath42 is the critical partial wave for projectile fusion .",
    "the cross sections are calculated using @xmath43 where @xmath44 $ ] and @xmath45 is the projectile mass .    beside the absolute cross sections ( [ eq2 ] ) ,",
    "asymptotic observables , such as the angle , kinetic energy and relative energy distributions of the fragments from ncbu events , are calculated by tracking their trajectories to a large distance from the target .",
    "\\(vi ) for the icf events , the time propagation of the icf product and the surviving breakup fragment is now incorporated into this model as follows .",
    "the fragment f@xmath32 ( after overcoming the coulomb barrier @xmath46 ) reaches the target radius , forming the icf product , while the other fragment flies away . at this moment",
    ", the three - body propagation turns into a two - body propagation , with definite interaction potentials and initial conditions .",
    "these are determined by the position and velocity of the three particles , at the moment when the icf product is formed .",
    "these also yield the spin and excitation energy distributions of the _ primary _ icf product .",
    "the asymptotic angular distribution of the icf product and the surviving breakup fragment is calculated in terms of their trajectories .",
    "this model is implemented in the platypus code , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to illustrate the new developments of ( vi ) ,",

    "<S> the classical dynamical model for reactions induced by weakly - bound nuclei at near - barrier energies is developed further . </S>",
    "<S> it allows a quantitative study of the role and importance of incomplete fusion dynamics in asymptotic observables , such as the population of high - spin states in reaction products as well as the angular distribution of direct alpha - production . </S>",
    "<S> model calculations indicate that incomplete fusion is an effective mechanism for populating high - spin states , and its contribution to the direct alpha production yield diminishes with decreasing energy towards the coulomb barrier . </S>",
    "<S> it also becomes notably separated in angles from the contribution of no - capture breakup events . </S>",
    "<S> this should facilitate the experimental disentanglement of these competing reaction processes . </S>"
