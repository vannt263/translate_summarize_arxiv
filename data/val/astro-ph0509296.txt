    "newly discovered lens systems can be of interest both for individual study and as additional datapoints in studies of lens ensembles . in some cases",
    ", lens samples can be used to draw statistical inferences without particular regard to how the lenses were selected ( eg treu & koopmans 2004 , rusin & kochanek 2005 ) , but studies which consider properties of the lens population , such as the distribution of image separations ( eg li & ostriker 2002 , chae and mao 2003 ) , or the quad fraction @xcite , would benefit from a sample defined by a clearly understood selection procedure , so as to allow for the correction of selection effects . to date , the best - defined sample is that produced by the class radio survey @xcite .",
    "however , the fact that only @xmath4 of quasars are radio - loud @xcite implies that optical surveys offer the best future prospect for assembling large statistical samples .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( * ? ? ? * henceforth sdss ) dataset provides an excellent opportunity to discover gravitationally lensed quasars .",
    "the @xmath5 deg@xmath6 of five - band photometry and the spectroscopic sample of @xmath7 quasars should allow for the compilation of a lensed quasar sample which is both large and statistically well - defined in comparison to existing optical samples .",
    "the parent sample of sdss quasars is selected by a single clearly defined algorithm @xcite and the uniform image processing pipeline allows for geometric selection effects to be accurately characterized through the use of image simulations ( pindor et al .",
    "2003 , henceforth p03 ) . to date",
    ", the sdss has discovered several galaxy - scale lenses ( eg . johnston et al .",
    "2003 , pindor et al . 2004 ) as well as the largest known quasar lens @xcite . in this work , we report follow - up observations of two objects identified as promising lens candidates during an mmt spectroscopic run .",
    "we also present a list of objects which have been ruled out as gravitational lenses during our ongoing search for lensed quasars in the sdss dataset .",
    "the sdss is a photometric and spectroscopic survey across 10,000 square degrees of the northern galactic cap using the 2.5 m sdss telescope at apache point observatory .",
    "sdss imaging is carried out with a wide - field camera @xcite which makes nearly simultaneous observations of objects in five passbands : @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "together , the passbands cover the optical wavelengths from the atmospheric cut - off in the blue to the minimum detectable energy for the silicon ccds in the red @xcite .",
    "photometric calibration of the imaging survey is separately carried out by an automated 0.5 m telescope which monitors a set of standard stars @xcite while photometric data is being acquired @xcite .",
    "the position of the stellar locus can be used to independently verify the accuracy of the photometric zeropoint calibrations @xcite .",
    "the sdss imaging camera also incorporates astrometric ccds which provide astrometry of detected objects with an accuracy typically better than 0@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "sdss spectroscopy is carried out on the same telescope by two fiber - fed double spectrographs which produce spectra with a resolution ( @xmath14 ) of @xmath15 2000 covering the wavelength range 38009200  .",

    "five - band photometry of sdssj  102111.02 + 491330.4 ( henceforth sdss  j1021 + 4913 ) and sdss  j112012.12 + 671116.0 ( henceforth sdss  j1120 + 6711 ) , respectively , was obtained in the course of normal sdss imaging on 2001 december 19 and 2000 april 27 . on the basis of their broad - band colors ,",
    "both objects were identified as quasar candidates by sdss quasar target selection .",
    "sdss spectroscopy on 2002 march 13 confirmed sdss  j1021 + 4913 to be a quasar at a redshift of @xmath0 , and on 2001 february 02 confirmed sdss  j1120 + 6711 to be a quasar at a redshift of @xmath2 .",
    "having been confirmed as quasars , both objects were selected as lens candidates by the selection algorithm described by p03 .",
    "this algorithm uses the point spread function ( psf ) , as measured by the sdss photometric pipeline @xcite , to fit the postage stamp image of each @xmath16 sdss quasar to both a one and two point source model .",
    "lens candidates , which are expected to exhibit multiple images , are required to show a significant improvement in goodness - of - fit when modelled with two point sources , as compared to one .",
    "further , selected candidates are required to have a best - fit component separation of @xmath17 , to have a consistent geometry when fitted independently in @xmath9,@xmath10 , and @xmath11 , and to exhibit a color difference between quasar images not exceeding that allowed by a simple reddening model .",
    "our two psf photometric models of the sdss atlas images predicted for sdss  j1021 + 4913 a component separation of @xmath18 and a flux ratio of a / b @xmath19 2:1 , and for sdss  j1120 + 6711 a component separation of @xmath20 and a flux ratio of a / b @xmath19 4:1 .",
    "we further note that both candidates were also independently identified by the selection algorithm of @xcite .",
    "we observed both objects on 2003 april 6 , using the 6.5 m multiple mirror telescope ( mmt ) .",
    "spectra were obtained using the blue channel of the mmt spectrograph with the 300/mm grating and @xmath21 slit , yielding a spectral resolution of 6  .",
    "the slit was aligned along the separation axis of the pairs , as predicted from sdss imaging by a photometric model consisting of two point sources ( see p03 ) , so that the two components were observed simultaneously .",
    "the integration time was 600s for sdss  j1021 + 4913 and 900s for sdss  j1120 + 6711 .",
    "although the seeing at the time of observation was approximately @xmath21 , the small separation between the quasar pairs led to their only being marginally resolved in the focal plane .",
    "consequently , we implemented a deblending procedure to minimize cross - contamination between the extracted 1d spectra .",
    "the spectra were deblended as follows :    - the 2d spectrum was binned into 20 bins along the dispersion axis and the flux in each of these bins was integrated to produce a series of 20 spatial cross - sections .",
    "- a profile consisting of two gaussians was fitted to each of the spatial cross - sections , subject to the constraint that the separation between the two gaussians be the same for each bin .",
    "- apertures for the two components were defined by assigning a fraction of the flux from each pixel to the first ( second ) aperture corresponding to the fractional contribution of the first ( second ) gaussian to the model profile at that pixel .",
    "hence , the model profiles can be thought of as relative weights which determine how much of the flux in a given pixel should be assigned to either of the two apertures .",
    "this procedure is designed to ensure that the extracted apertures accurately trace the positions of the two objects on the 2d image . however , for objects such as sdss  j1021 + 4913 , where the images of the two components overlap significantly in the focal plane , it can not all together eliminate cross - contamination .",
    "fortunately , we can estimate and correct for the presence of contaminating flux as follows :    - two additional gaussian models ( sets of weights ) are constructed , each of which is a spatial reflection of the one of the original pair of gaussian models with respect to the position of the other .",
    "for instance , the first reflected model is identical in shape to the first real model but appears on the other ( spatial ) side of the the second real model .",
    "- two reflected apertures are then assigned flux as above , using one reflected and one real set of weights for each .",
    "for instance , flux is assigned to the first reflected aperture using the first reflected and second real gaussians .",
    "assuming that the psf is essentially symmetric along the separation axis , these reflected apertures now contain the same amount of contaminating flux from the adjacent object as the real ( unreflected ) apertures .",
    "cross - contamination can be corrected for by subtracting the flux in each reflected aperture from that in the corresponding real aperture .",
    "figure [ ref_ap ] schematically illustrates our deblending procedure .",
    "figure [ 1021_spec ] shows the spectra of the two components of sdss  j1021 + 4913 .",
    "we cross - correlated the spectra and estimated the velocity difference between them be less than the dispersion per pixel , corresponding to @xmath22 km  s@xmath23 , and consistent with zero .",
    "the most significant spectral difference between the two components is that component b appears considerably redder at the blue end than component a. this qualitative assessment is supported by measurements of the equivalent widths of emission lines in the two components ( primary : ly @xmath24 ( 450@xmath25100   ) ( 400@xmath2510   ) ( 105@xmath2510   ) secondary : ly @xmath24 ( 300@xmath2550   ) ( 390@xmath2530   ) ( 95@xmath2510   ) ) , although there are large uncertainties associated with determining an appropriate continuum level for ly @xmath24 .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained as being due to varying extinction along different sightlines through the lens galaxy .",
    "note that the feature at 7600   is atmospheric .",
    "figure [ 1120_spec ] shows the spectra of the two components of sdss  j1120 + 6711 .",
    "we cross - correlated the spectra and also estimated the velocity difference between them to be less than 100 km  s@xmath23 .",
    "the spectra of the two components differ significantly ; the continuum of the brighter component is much redder at the blue end , the strength of the line relative to the other lines is much greater in the fainter component , and there is no evidence in the fainter component of the broad complex which is seen blueward of in the brighter component .    in summary",
    ", spatially - resolved spectroscopy revealed that both sdss  j1021 + 4913 and sdss  j1120 + 6711 are quasar pairs with indistinguishable redshifts .",
    "however , the two components of sdss  j1021 + 4913 have similar spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , consistent with the lensing hypothesis , while the two components of sdss  j1120 + 6711 have significantly different seds .",
    "we subsequently obtained near - ir imaging of these two systems in order to search for the existence of a possible lens galaxy in each case .",
    "on 2003 august 12 , we imaged the system in the @xmath26-band using the near infrared camera ( nirc , matthews & soifer 1994 ) on the keck i telescope .",
    "the observations consisted of a five - point dither pattern , integrating for 30s at each pointing .",
    "the data were flattened , sky subtracted , shifted , and stacked using the dimsum package in iraf .",
    "figure [ 1021_nirc ] shows the @xmath26-band image of sdss  j1021 + 4913 .",
    "it is clear that the fainter component is extended relative to the brighter component .",
    "it is unlikely that this extended flux is associated with the quasar host galaxy since i ) it would put the quasar at a very unusual off - center position relative to the host galaxy center - of - light , and ii ) it would be an additional co - incidence that the host galaxy emission happens to concentrate between the two quasars . instead",
    ", we interpret this extended flux as indicating the presence of a lens galaxy .",
    "the lens galaxy is bright enough that it makes impractical a simple psf subtraction .",
    "hence , we modelled the system as a combination of three components ; two point sources , using the profile recommended by @xcite , and an extended component represented by a devaucouleurs profile of the form :    @xmath27    convolved with the psf . in general , a devaucouleurs profile can also account for the axis ratio and position angle of a galaxy on the sky , but we chose this circularly symmetric form for simplicity .",
    "the parameters for the best - fit model are listed in table [ 1021_table ] .",
    "the uncertainties in this model are dominated by systematic errors associated with the imperfect psf model .",
    "the errors listed are the observed variation in the model parameters when the best - fit fwhm is varied by @xmath25 10% .",
    "the reduced chi - square of the best - fit two point sources plus devaucouleurs model is 1.6 ( 1590 degrees of freedom ) . for comparison ,",
    "the reduced chi - square of the best - fit two points sources ( only ) model is 5.5 ( 1594 d.o.f . ) .",
    "we interpret this improvement in the fit as definitive evidence for the presence of a lens galaxy , and consequently , in support of the lensing hypothesis .",
    "there are no sources in the field bright enough to allow for direct calibration to 2mass photometry @xcite , but we can use the results of covey et al .",
    "( 2005 , in preparation ) , who characterized the stellar locus in optical and near - ir colors , to predict the @xmath28-band magnitudes of sdss - detected stars in the field .",
    "the errors in the derived magnitudes listed in table [ 1021_table ] include the width of the stellar locus in the relevant optical - ir color space .",
    "however , we do not have enough data to characterize possible systematic errors in this photometric calibration , which may be significant compared to the random errors quoted .",
    "the best - fit photometric model indicates that the angular separation between quasar image a and g(alaxy ) is nearly the same as bg .",
    "a simple singular isothermal sphere mass model , naturally , predicts that the quasar images should have nearly equal fluxes in this case .",
    "instead , the observed flux ratio is a / b @xmath19 5:2 .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained by i ) extinction of image b relative to image a , consistent with the differential reddening noted above , or ii ) modelling the lens galaxy with a more complicated mass distribution .    to explore the latter possibility , we modelled the lens system using two mass models ; a singular isothermal sphere with external shear ( sis+shear ) model and a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) model .",
    "each model has eight parameters : the einstein radius @xmath29 , shear or ellipticity ( @xmath30 or @xmath31 ) and its position angle ( @xmath32 or @xmath33 ) , the position of the lens galaxy , the position of the source quasar , and the flux of the source quasar .",
    "the number of observables is also eight , therefore the number of degrees of freedom is zero .",
    "we fit the mass models with the public software _",
    "lensmodel _ @xcite .",
    "as expected , both models yield almost perfect fits , chi - square of @xmath34 .",
    "the resulting best - fit values are summarized in table [ massmodel_table ] .",
    "we find that we can reproduce the photometric observations with mass models which have realistically small shear / ellipticity , @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "thus the lensing hypothesis is also supported by our mass modelling of the system .",
    "we estimated the expected time delays between images and find that they are quite small , @xmath37 ( b leads a ) , assuming a lens redshift of @xmath38 .",
    "this is because of almost the equal angular separation between ag and bg .      on 2004",
    "may 8 , we imaged sdss  j1120 + 6711 in the @xmath39-band at the mmt using the aries instrument @xcite and the f/15 mmt / ao adaptive secondary @xcite . there is no guide star close enough to permit closed - loop imaging , but we used a bright star @xmath40 away to phase up the optical system .",
    "we integrated for 16 minutes before clouds rolled in .",
    "the resulting stack of images has a @xmath41 fwhm .",
    "figure [ 1120_image ] shows the h - band image of sdss  j1120 + 6711 .",
    "the point sources appear extended because they are highly oversampled by the minute pixel scale ( 0@xmath42 ) , but there is no obvious indication of a lens galaxy . indeed , a two point source model , again using the model profile of racine ( 1996 ) ,",
    "fits the image very well ; yielding a reduced chi - square of 1.2 ( 6394 d.o.f . ) and leaving residuals , shown in figure [ 1120_residuals ] , with no obvious flux concentrations .",
    "the parameters for this photometric model are listed in table [ 1120_table ] .",
    "again , the magnitudes listed are derived by estimating the optical - infrared colors of stars in the field from their sdss colors .",
    "having subtracted the point sources , we set an upper limit on the flux of any remaining sources by introducing simulated point sources into the residual image and visually inspecting these simulated residuals .",
    "we thus estimated that any remaining sources could have a point source flux of not more than 10% of the combined flux of components a and b. this upper limit corresponds to a magnitude of @xmath43 .",
    "we can compare this upper limit to the results of @xcite who found that the observed magnitudes of lens galaxies can be predicted from their observed image separations through the relation    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the distance modulus , @xmath46 is a parameter subsuming evolution and spectral k - corrections , @xmath47 is the slope of the faber - jackson relation in the chosen band , @xmath48 is the lens galaxy ( deflector ) redshift , and @xmath49 is the reduced image separation , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the image separation produced by a singular isothermal sphere with a velocity dispersion of 225 km  s@xmath23 , and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the angular diameter distances between the observer and source and deflector and source , respectively .",
    "the @xmath39-band values of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are all given by rusin et al .",
    ", based upon hst photometry and spectrophotometric modelling of 28 early - type lens galaxies . the observed rms scatter is @xmath57 magnitudes",
    "this relation predicts that given an observed source redshift and image separation , there exists a redshift at which the lens galaxy has a maximum apparent magnitude . in the case of sdss",
    "j1120 + 6711 , the maximum occurs at @xmath58 and implies that @xmath59 . in short",
    ", we did not detect any indication of a lens galaxy in our @xmath39-band image of sdss  j1120 + 6711 , and a simple estimate indicates that this non - detection is inconsistent with the presence of a lens galaxy of typical luminosity .",
    "we further obtained deep @xmath60-band images of these two objects using the 8k mosaic ccd on the university of hawaii 2.2 m telescope ( uh88 ) at mauna kea .",
    "the imaging was conducted on 2004 may 23 ( sdss  j1021 + 4913 ) and 25 ( sdss  j1120 + 6711 ) . the integration times were 120 sec for sdss  j1120 + 6711 and 360 sec for sdss  j1021 + 4913 .",
    "we estimate the fwhm of these images to be @xmath61 .",
    "note that the optical and near - ir images were independently analyzed by two of the authors , inada and pindor respectively , and discrepancies between the photometric models are most likely indicative of the systematic errors present .",
    "figure [ 1021_uh88 ] shows the @xmath60-band image of sdss  j1021 + 4913 , both as observed and following the subtraction of two point sources . for the optical data ,",
    "the point source subtraction was performed using a gaussian psf model whose fwhm was determined by fitting to nearby stars . table [",
    "1021_table ] lists the corresponding photometric model .",
    "photometric calibration was obtained relative to the standard star pg 1528 + 062 @xcite .",
    "the listed magnitude errors do not include the photometric uncertainty of the standard star .",
    "we take the close agreement between our optical and near - ir models as definitive confirmation of the presence of the lens galaxy .",
    "certainly , the derived galaxy magnitude makes this object too bright to be a @xmath62 host galaxy @xcite .",
    "we can invert the relation of rusin et al . to estimate the lens galaxy redshift , but the derived constraint @xmath63 ( 66% confidence ) is not very stringent .",
    "figure [ 1120_uh88 ] shows the @xmath60-band image of sdss  j1120 + 6711 , both as observed and following the subtraction of two point sources .",
    "1120_table ] lists the corresponding photometric model .",
    "we are unable to detect any object in the residual image corresponding to more than a @xmath64 fluctuation above the sky level .",
    "we estimate that this corresponds to an upper limit of @xmath65 . again employing the method of rusin et al .",
    ", we predict that the @xmath60-band magnitude of the lens galaxy should be @xmath66  . in agreement with our @xmath39-band image , the @xmath60-band image of sdss  j1120",
    "+ 6711 shows no evidence of a lens galaxy and is inconsistent with the presence of a lens galaxy of typical luminosity .",
    "the observations reported above have confirmed that sdss  j102111.02 + 491330.4 is almost certainly a previously unknown gravitationally lensed quasar .",
    "high spatial resolution spectroscopy revealed the existence of two quasar images with an angular separation of @xmath1 and having identical redshifts of @xmath0 .",
    "high resolution @xmath26-band imaging indicates the presence of a lens galaxy between the two quasar images .",
    "sdss  j1021 + 4913 does not appear to have any peculiarities which would obviously compel individual studies of the system .",
    "conversely , the fact that simple lens models readily reproduce the lens geometry implies that the system is well - suited to various ensemble studies .",
    "the utility of this system in such studies would be aided an improved photometric characterization and optical redshift measurement of the lens galaxy , both of which should be plausible for an 8 m class telescope .",
    "our mass models predict a short time delay ( @xmath67 day ) , but the relatively small separation of the two quasar images makes the system less than ideal for a monitoring campaign .",
    "sdss  j1021 + 4913 represents an incremental increase in what will likely soon be the largest uniformly selected sample of lensed quasars .",
    "the sdss lens sample will have an additional merit relative to radio surveys like class in that both the redshifts of the lensed sources are known and the redshift distribution of the background quasar population is well - characterized @xcite .",
    "observations of sdss  j112012.12 + 671116.0 indicate that it is more likely a binary quasar than a lensed pair . although the two components are both quasars with indistinguishable redshifts of @xmath2 , they have markedly different seds .",
    "optical and @xmath39-band imaging of the system did not reveal any indication of a lens galaxy .",
    "binary quasars can be considered a contaminant in a search for gravitational lenses , but they are interesting objects in their own right . the sdss has previously discovered a number of other binary quasars , although mostly , due to fibre collisions , at considerably greater angular separations @xcite .",
    "a sample of sdss selected binary quasars will provide insights on quasar clustering and the onset of the quasar phenomenon ( hennawi et al , in preparation ) .",
    "it has been known for some time that extrapolating observed large scale quasar - quasar clustering to small separations considerably underpredicts the number of arcsecond scale binaries @xcite .",
    "hence , the confirmation of sdss  j1120 + 6711 and other uniformly selected binaries is the best empirical method for determining to binary to lens ratio at these separations .",

    "the program of follow - up observations which confirmed the lensing nature of sdss  j1021 + 4913 and several previous sdss - identified gravitational lenses also served to reject the lensing hypothesis for numerous objects .",
    "nonlens_table ] lists the positions of these rejected lens candidates .",
    "typically , spatially - resolved spectroscopy has shown these objects to be qso plus star superpositions . for objects which are not commented , we are unable to confidently identify the nature of the secondary object , but we can rule out the presence of broad quasar emission lines matching those of the primary object .",
    "the one binary quasar listed , sdss  j1600 + 0000 , has an obvious redshift difference .",
    "we have indicated those objects which satisfy the selection criteria of p03 .",
    "those objects which do not satisfy the p03 selection were either observed prior to finalization of the algorithm , selected by an altogether different algorithm , or were marginal candidates which were chosen due to observing conditions . from this list , we can surmise that quasar plus star superpositions dominate the population of false postives in this optical search , and that , compared to the @xmath68 10 lenses which have been discovered or were previously known in the parent sample , the number of binaries is considerably smaller than the number of lenses at separations of @xmath69 .",
    "this is not an exhaustive list of those lens candidates which we have observed , but rather a list of those candidates which we are confident do not merit further observation in the context of lensing investigations .",
    "it should not in any way be taken as a statistical complement to the list of published sdss lenses . instead",
    ", our main motivation in publishing this list is to inform other investigators who might independantly select these objects as lens candidates of the results of these observations .",
    "additional photometric and spectroscopic data for these objects are available through the sdss skyserver .",
