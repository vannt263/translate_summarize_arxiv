    "guided motion of liquid droplets along the flow in general and separation of emulsions into their individual components in particular are important issues in many applications such as filtration of oil - residuals from water @xcite or separation of protein containing emulsions after initial protein separation by liquid - liquid partitioning .",
    "individual droplets can also serve as highly efficient microreactors in order to synthesize e.g.nanoparticles and quantum dots @xcite or they can be used in information processing as bits @xcite .    due to the high surface to volume ratio in microfluidic systems , geometrical confinement",
    "to guide liquid flow may be replaced in parts by chemically patterned surfaces @xcite .",
    "moreover , surface energy gradients can be used to drive liquid motion .",
    "the surface energy gradients are often generated by external stimuli , e.g.  uv - illumination @xcite , electrochemical reactions @xcite or by a surfactant source @xcite .",
    "these and other experiments demonstrate the strong influence of surface wettability on liquid dynamics in microfluidic systems .    in the present work ,",
    "we use surfaces with an abrupt ( step - like ) change in wetting properties to separate emulsions .",
    "the approach based on the use of a substrate with spatially varying wetting properties ( a wetting gradient ) is particularly interesting , since it does not require any additional energy source other than that needed for the preparation of the chemical gradient .",
    "first experimental studies of wetting gradient induced separation phenomena were performed by ionov , stamm and coworkers on polymer brush substrates with a continuous variation of the contact angle @xcite .    in these studies ,",
    "the spatial variation of the wetting properties is controlled by a corresponding variation of the composition of the individual polymer components .",
    "flow experiments on these substrates clearly demonstrate the physical significance of the underlying concept , namely that a spatial variation in wetting properties of the substrate can lead to the separation of a binary emulsion into its individual components @xcite .",
    "however , it is also noted that the system with a continuous wetting gradient ( as compared to a step - like change in wetting properties used in this work ) is too complex to allow a clear identification of underlying mechanisms leading to a separation of the model emulsion .    here",
    ", the term complex refers to both the experimental production and the separation process itself .",
    "( 1 ) experimental production : wettability gradients used in previous work have been fabricated using binary polymer brushes .",
    "this procedure is very sensitive to the experimental conditions and the quality of the source material obtained from the manufacturer .",
    "furthermore three fabrication steps are required , namely the deposition of an adhesive layer , the deposition of the first brush component and the deposition of the second brush component .",
    "further details can be found in ref .",
    "( 2 ) separation process : firstly , a step gradient of wettability affects the liquid only locally but the separation efficiency increases with the gradient strength which is strongest in the case of a step gradient . secondly a weaker gradient strength can not be compensated by an increasing gradient length due to surface energy hysteresis . thus at the present level of knowledge the step gradient of wettability seems to be favorable .",
    "in addition to these aspects , the polymer brush gradient surfaces , which are often used to produce continuous wetting gradients , are very sensitive to pollution and their fabrication is a complex time consuming procedure .",
    "therefore , there is a strong need to conduct separation experiments on easy to fabricate , robust , reproducible and well describable model gradient surfaces .",
    "a further , very important aspect is the need for a theoretical approach allowing not only to rationalize the experimental findings , but also to study the basic underlying mechanisms independently .",
    "the present work provides such a combined experimental / theoretical study .",
    "an important prerequisite for the realization of reproducible separation experiments is the generation of emulsions with well defined droplet size . for this purpose , a channel with a diameter of 1.5 mm with two in- and",
    "one outlet is used to generate a binary emulsion ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : emulsion - generation]b for a schematic view ) . into one inlet the solvent ( here toluene ) and into the other inlet water is injected .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : emulsion - generation]a , the size of the water and the solvent droplets can be controlled via a variation of the ratio between the injection rates of the solvent and the water components .",
    "there is , however , a lower limit to the size of water droplets .",
    "the smallest droplet size is determined by the cross - sectional area of the channel and is approximately 2.9@xmath0l ( micro liter ) in this setup .",
    "smaller droplets are unstable in the sense that they float in the surrounding liquid medium ( toluene ) until they come in contact and coalesce , whereby forming larger droplets .",
    "this process goes on until the resulting droplet fills the channel s cross section .",
    "two such ( large ) droplets are then separated along the channel by a drop of toluene thus preventing their coalescence .",
    "we use , in this series of experiments , the simplest kind of a wetting gradient , namely a step - wise change in the contact angle . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dipcoating]c , a step gradient consists of two half planes of different wetting properties .",
    "it is , therefore , easy to fabricate via partly dip - coating of initially hydrophilic substrates ( silicon wafer , glass ) with hydrophobic coatings as schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dipcoating]a .",
    "the substrate is dipped into the solution containing the methacrylate copolymer .",
    "the substrate is not dipped into a solution of the different components .",
    "the methacrylate copolymer contains a silane cross - linking component .",
    "this component leads not only to internal cross - linking of the polymer film but also to cross - linking of the substrate by the formation of siloxane bonds .    for the hydrophobic coating",
    ", we use the block - co - polymer poly-(tert - butylmethacrylate - co - zonyl@xmath1-co-3-trimethoxysilylpropylmethacrylate ) 6:2:2 provided by our co - worker r.  frenzel from the ipf dresden @xcite .",
    "the fabrication process is proven to be reproducible and the surfaces show stable wetting properties over long periods of time .",
    "the substrates are characterized by contact angle measurements and ellipsometry .",
    "varying the block - copolymer concentration of the toluene solution and the dip - coating speed , we are able to control the thickness of the coating film in the range of 5 nm to 24 nm . the wetting properties of the coated substrate are found to be independent of the film thickness with an average advancing contact angle of @xmath2 and an average receding contact angle of @xmath3 .",
    "the polymer films turned out to be stable after exposition to water and solvents for 30 min at @xmath4c in the ultrasonic bath .",
    "the polymer coatings have the advantage to form stable homogeneous films on all substrates of interest such as silicon wafers , glass , aluminum , silicon nitride and epoxy resins .      in parallel to the above mentioned experimental methods",
    ", we also address basic questions relevant for the separation process theoretically .",
    "this includes simple analytical estimates as well as lattice boltzmann computer simulations .    in the past twenty years , the lattice boltzmann method @xcite has proved itself as a versatile theoretical tool for the study of a variety of fluid dynamical phenomena such as the flow through porous media @xcite , flow of polymer solutions @xcite as well as properties of suspensions of solid particles @xcite , to name just a few examples .",
    "comprehensive introductions to the general foundations of the lattice boltzmann method can be found in recent monographs @xcite as well as in review articles @xcite .    while examples given above are mainly based on ( extensions of ) the lb method for the so called ideal fluids ( fluids with an ideal gas equation of state ) ,",
    "other lb approaches have been devised allowing the simulation of e.g.a liquid in coexistence with its vapor as well as a binary fluid mixture @xcite .    in this work , we employ a free energy based lattice boltzmann method capable of adequately simulating both the static and the dynamic properties of a liquid - vapor system .",
    "the method has first been proposed by swift and coworkers who used the method for a study of spinodal decomposition and domain growth @xcite .",
    "the original version of the method suffered , however , from the lack of galilean invariance , a serious drawback , when hydrodynamic transport becomes a relevant issue .",
    "this problem was solved by holdych and coworkers @xcite who proposed a modified expression for the relation between the pressure tensor and the second moments of the population densities in the lattice boltzmann model .",
    "the model was developed further by other coworkers and was applied for a study of interesting issues such as the motion of three phase contact line in two dimensions @xcite and roughness effects on liquid - solid slippage @xcite .",
    "the reader interested in an elaborate discussion of the present lattice boltzmann approach is referred to many publications by julia yeomans and coworkers , some examples of which were cited above @xcite . here , we give a brief overview of the method only .",

    ", a binary emulsion enters the gradient zone in a direction perpendicular to the direction of wetting gradient ( see e.g.  the lower image in fig .  [",
    "fig : sep_exp]b ) . in the absence of a wetting gradient ,",
    "each component of the emulsion would have equal probabilities of selecting either the right or the left arm of the channel .",
    "the role of the wetting gradient is to induce a preferential deflection of at least one of the fluid components .",
    "note that , as will be shown below ( figs.[fig : sep_exp2 ] and [ fig : sep_exp3 ] ) , selective wetting of one of the fluid components is sufficient for a successful separation . to keep the analysis as simple as possible , it is , therefore , reasonable to first focus on the effects of a step - wise wetting gradient on the motion of a single fluid droplet .",
    "suppose that a fluid droplet is in contact with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts of a substrate with a step - like wetting gradient .",
    "due to different contact angles on the both sides of the wetting gradient , there will be a net force on the droplet pushing it towards the more hydrophilic ( or , equivalently , less hydrophobic ) part of the substrate .",
    "this force is proportional to the derivative of the underlying thermodynamic potential ( the sum of all the surface free energies involved in the problem ) with respect to the equilibrium contact angle .",
    "on the other hand , it is not unreasonable to assume that the droplet can locally adapt its contact angle to the local equilibrium value within a time short compared to the translation of the droplet over the chemical step . in this case",
    ", the droplet shape will be a kind of compromise ( interpolation ) between two spherical caps , corresponding to the contact angles on both sides of the wettability step .",
    "focusing on the proximity of the substrate , the droplet shape far from the chemical step will be close to that of a spherical cap with a contact angle - dependent radius of curvature . as a consequence , a gradient in the laplace pressure ( see below ) will form _ inside _ the droplet , trying to push it towards the more hydrophilic side of the substrate ( see e.g.  fig .",
    "[ fig : lbm_spreading_on_step_grad ] ) .",
    "it is , therefore , instructive to start with simple analytical estimates of the laplace pressure and its dependence on the contact angle and other relevant parameters .",

    "the pressure inside the droplet is @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the pressure outside the droplet , and @xmath105 the so called laplace pressure arising from the curvature @xmath106 of the liquid - vapor interface ( @xmath107surface tension .",
    "the factor of 2 originates from the presence of two equal radii of curvature ) .",
    "note that , in the above , we express the pressure inside the droplet in terms of the radius of curvature and not the radius of contact area .",

    "the radius of curvature of a spherical cap is given by @xmath110 as can be obtained via integrating a portion of the sphere for polar angles in the interval [ 0 , @xmath45 ] .",

    "[ fig : pl ] shows , for the case of water , the laplace pressure versus contact angle for a spherical cap of @xmath113l volume ( circles ) . for contact angles close or below @xmath114 , the laplace pressure varies rather fast but then approaches a quasi - plateau as the hydrophobic zone is reached .",
    "the horizontal dashed line serves to highlight this limiting behavior .",
    "note that it is the _ difference _ in laplace pressure , @xmath115 , which is the origin of a driving force .",
    "more precisely , for a given variation in the contact angle , the driving force per unit volume ( force density ) , @xmath116 , is proportional to the _ gradient _ of the laplace pressure : @xmath117 since @xmath118 on open substrates approaches zero for large contact angles , increasing the contact angle of the more hydrophobic part of the substrate ( i.e.making it still more hydrophobic ) does not necessarily lead to a significantly higher driving force density .",

    "moreover , for channel heights smaller than the capillary length , the gravitational effects on the shape of the liquid / air interface may be neglected @xcite .    under these circumstances ,",
    "the radius of curvature of the liquid / air front in a planar slit is given by @xmath128 .",

    "let us examine whether we are allowed to use the above estimates in the case of our experiments .",
    "for this purpose we first estimate the capillary length in order to see whether neglecting gravity is justified . for water , using the values of the surface tension @xmath135 , mass density @xmath136 and gravitational acceleration @xmath137 , the capillary length can be estimated as @xmath138 mm . since the height of the channel used in our experiments is @xmath139 mm and thus significantly smaller than @xmath140 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sep_exp2 ] ) , gravity does not play a major role here .    as to the independence of the radius of curvature from the liquid volume , the size of the smallest fluid droplet leaving our emulsion generator is @xmath141l ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : emulsion - generation ] ) . once entered the planar slit , such a droplet spreads horizontally taking approximately the shape of a circular disk ( cylinder ) with a radius , @xmath142 , given by @xmath143 . setting the numbers @xmath144 and @xmath139 mm , one obtains @xmath145 mm which is roughly three times the gap height .",
    "this justifies the assumption that the shape of the liquid - vapor interface is independent of the droplet volume .",
    "thus , even for the smallest droplet in our experiments , the laplace pressure within the slit and the corresponding wettability gradient induced driving forces can be estimated via eqs .",

    "the dependence of the laplace pressure upon the contact angle for the case of a closed planar geometry is shown in the panel c ) of fig .",

    "obviously , for the range of parameters studied in our experiments , the slit geometry allows the formation of significantly higher gradients in laplace pressure than would be possible on an open substrate .",
    "furthermore and in sharp contrast to open geometry , this applies to contact angle variations both in the hydrophilic and in the hydrophobic regime : as shown in the panel d ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : pl ] , for a difference of @xmath146 , the curves for @xmath147 and @xmath148 are practically identical in the case of a slit geometry while on open substrate the gradient of the laplace pressure drops significantly when going from @xmath147 to @xmath148 .",
    "a significant decrease of @xmath149 is , however , observed also in the case of a slit when choosing @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "this is not surprising since the laplace pressure as a function of the contact angle gradually flattens for large contact angles .",
    "this point is nicely seen in the panel c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : pl ] .    while neglecting many complications occurring in real experiments , this simple estimate yields at least a qualitative understanding of higher separation efficiency observed in confined channels as compared to open substrates .",

    "[ fig : sep_exp ] ) .",
    "a demixing of the water - toluene emulsion is observed in all the experiments performed on open substrates .",
    "furthermore , these experiments suggest that the selectivity of water with respect to the both parts of the substrate mainly drives the separation",
    ". we will come back to this important point below .",
    "with respect to applications , experiments in confined geometries are of major importance because confinement prevents fast liquid evaporation that would occur in open miniaturized systems .",
    "therefore , in a further step , we turned our attention to separation experiments in confined geometries , i.e. in closed cells .    separation cells with widths ( horizontal extensions ) of 1 mm , 2 mm , 3 mm , 4 mm , 8 mm , 14 mm and 20 mm were used . however , for the separation cells with a width less than 20 mm , a stable reproducible separation process could not be established .",
    "qualitatively , we observe a decrease of separation efficiency upon a reduction of channel width .",
    "this suggests that adhesive forces due to surface energy hysteresis oppose the driving forces induced by the step gradient of wettability .",
    "a detailed analysis of this issue can be found in @xcite .    in the case of the largest separation cell investigated ( width=20 mm ) ,",
    "the separation efficiency is 100mislead droplets are observed . for flow rates between 5",
    "ml / min and 10 ml / min single droplets of the wrong component are observed on the hydrophobic and the hydrophilic side .",
    "the estimated separation efficiency in this case remains well above 90 , a separation cell with integrated reservoirs for each outlet is being developed which will enable us to specify the separation efficiency more precisely .",
    "however , this modification is not trivial because the attachment of additional fluidic components changes the boundary conditions of the whole problem .",

    "interestingly , the non - polar component of the mixture ( here hexane ( h ) ) also shows a tendency to flow along with water and wets the hydrophilic part of the channel ( see the liquid / air front in fig .",

    "is introduced , whereas through the other inlet only water is injected . for visualization purpose ,",
    "the water component in the mixture is colored with ink .",
    "as soon as the two water components come into contact , they form a continuous front across the channel pushing hexane to the right side of the channel .    at later stages of flow separation",
    ", a sharp interface builds up between the hexane and the aqueous phase . the straight interface between the two water components ( indicated as w and w2 ) reflects the laminar nature of the flow , a characteristic feature of most ( but not all , see e.g.  @xcite ) microflows . due to the absence of chaotic behavior , the two water components mix via diffusion only , a process slow compared to the time scale of the separation experiment .",
    "in section [ subsection : drivingforce ] we addressed , via simple analytic arguments , the driving forces resulting from a change in wetting properties of the substrate .",
    "these estimates are , however , based on the assumption of perfect spherical caps on each side of the step gradient with respective contact angles .",
    "obviously , a single droplet covering both sides of a step gradient can not satisfy this condition .",
    "rather , it will try to take a shape consistent with variable wettability of the substrate .",
    "this shape will probably resemble to a portion of a spherical cap at each end of the droplet ( away from the interface between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts of the substrate ) with a transition between the two different spherical caps in the step gradient zone .",
    "furthermore , dynamic effects , such as effects of dissipation loss on the force balance , are fully absent in the above analysis .",
    "this underlines the need for a full theoretical treatment of the problem including the whole complexity of the droplet shape variation across the transition zone as well as the internal fluid dynamics .",
    "the lattice boltzmann simulations to be presented below provide such an approach .      as already mentioned , a wetting gradient breaks the symmetry of the problem introducing a preferential deflection of a water droplet towards the more hydrophilic side of the channel .",
    "in order to elucidate this issue , we first performed a series of lattice boltzmann computer simulations of the droplet motion on a step gradient in the _ absence of external forces_. for this purpose , a spherical fluid droplet is deposited at time @xmath154 on the top of a step - like wetting gradient in a way that it slightly touches the line separating the zones of different wettability .",
    "the initial velocity of the droplet is zero , so that all dynamic effects originate from the tendency of the liquid to wet the substrate .",
    "furthermore , both the hydrophilic and the hydrophobic halves of the substrate are chosen to be perfectly flat thus ensuring the absence of hysteresis effects .",
    "they differ only in their static contact angles with respect to the fluid .",

    "the time necessary for the transfer of the whole droplet to the hydrophilic part is significantly larger than for the case discussed in the context of fig .",

    "quite similarly but with a _ smaller magnitude _ , the liquid - vapor interface close to the hydrophobic substrate moves towards left .    as a result of this asymmetric motion , the droplet spreads over the substrate while at the same time its center of mass is shifted towards the more hydrophilic part of the substrate .",
    "obviously , the observed horizontal motion of the droplet s center of mass is a result of the presence of a step gradient as highlighted via a comparison to droplet spreading on a chemically _ homogeneous _ substrate ( i.e.  a substrate with a spatially constant contact angle ; see the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vfield ] ) . in this case , the droplet symmetrically spreads on the substrate in order to reach its static contact angle , the latter being an input parameter of the simulation .",
    "the above lattice boltzmann simulations address the behavior of a droplet on a step gradient in the absence of flow , thus allowing to focus on the effect of a step gradient alone .",
    "when flow is present , there will be a possibility for an accidental deflection of the polar component of the mixture ( water in our experiments ) towards the more hydrophobic ( wrong ) side .",
    "this may be caused e.g.  due to imperfect geometry of the channel giving rise to random fluctuations in the velocity field .    as the deflected droplet moves over the step gradient ( towards the more hydrophobic side ) , a gradient of laplace pressure is formed inside the droplet pushing it back to the more hydrophilic part of the substrate . in order for the separation process to be successful ,",
    "this wetting gradient induced force must overcome the forces driving the flow .",
    "in a two component system , this force is usually the flow pressure. since our simulation studies are restricted to a one - component fluid and its vapor , we mimic the flow pressure via an external gravity - like force .    therefore , it is useful to consider what happens if a droplet is not only subject to the effects of separation forces stemming from the wetting gradient , but also to an opposite force .",

    "the flow pressure is mimicked by an external , gravity - like force density . each row in fig .",
    "[ fig : sphericalcap_on_gradsurf ] illustrates a spherical cap pushed under the action of exactly the same force density towards a chemical step ( from hydrophilic part towards hydrophobic one ) .",
    "as the droplet reaches the chemical step , the corresponding gradient in laplace pressure tries to hinder its motion and to keep it on the more hydrophilic side .",
    "despite the fact that the both droplets are subject to exactly the same force density , the presence of a wetting gradient leads to quite different dynamic behavior depending on the droplet size . while the larger droplet passes under the action of the external force over the step gradient ( upper images in fig .",

    "( [ eq : fxcap ] ) , this observation can be rationalized as follows .",
    "the wettability gradient induced force scales as @xmath189 and thus as @xmath190 , where @xmath191 is the radius of the initial droplet on the substrate .",
    "indeed , the two droplets in fig .  [ fig : sphericalcap_on_gradsurf ] differ by a factor of 2 in their initial radii .",
    "the force opposing the droplet motion is , therefore , expected to be by a factor of 4 larger in the case of the smaller droplet as compared to the larger one .    as a first test of the scaling behavior given in eq .",

    "nevertheless , an increase of the external gravity like force by a factor of 5 turns out to be sufficient for overcoming the step gradient effects .    noting that the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fxcap ] ) is based on a fully _ static _ argument ( setting the fluid velocity @xmath192 in the navier - stokes equation ) , the observed deviation between the dynamic behavior and this estimate is not surprising .",

    "the lateral extension of the hydrophilic side of the substrate is chosen such that the droplet can reach its steady state motion before arriving at the interface between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts of the substrate ( first plateau in the velocity in fig .",

    "this is indicative of lower dissipation losses for a motion on hydrophobic substrates .    as a consequence of the periodic boundary condition present in our simulations",
    ", we can also survey what happens when the external driving and wetting gradient forces act along the _ same _ direction .",
    "this occurs as the droplet leaves the channel at the left boundary and reenters it from the right side , thereby leaving the hydrophobic substrate towards the hydrophilic one . in this case",
    ", the droplet motion is accelerated by the action of the wetting gradient ( see the maximum in fig .  [",

    "as expected , the droplet spreads better on the hydrophilic part of the substrate than on the hydrophobic part . as a consequence , its lateral extension decreases leading to an increase in its height during the passage over the step gradient zone ( moving from right to left ) .",

    "basic aspects related to the wetting gradient induced separation of a binary emulsion into its individual components are studied via experiments as well as lattice boltzmann computer simulations . for the purpose of experimental investigations ,",
    "an emulsion generator is designed allowing the production of quasi - monodisperse emulsions with well controlled droplet sizes ( fig .",

    "basic results of our separation experiments can be summarized as follows .",
    "it is observed that separation in confined geometry is far more enhanced than on open substrates .",
    "furthermore , the separation process is mainly driven by the selectivity of the water component , i.e.  by the tendency of water to preferentially wet the more hydrophilic side of the substrate .",
    "this is best seen in a closed channel : once water fills the whole cross section of the separation chamber , it pushes the other component of the mixture ( toluene or hexane in our experiments ) to the less hydrophilic part of the channel ( fig .  [ fig : sep_exp2 ] ) .",
    "this property is then used in order to enhance the separation efficiency . for this purpose ,",
    "a second inlet is introduced on the opposite side of the channel through which water is injected into the separation chamber ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sep_exp3 ] ) .",
    "the separation starts as soon as the two water streams meet in the gap and build a water front spanning the whole cross section of the channel .",
    "these experimental observations are accompanied with order of magnitude estimates of the dominant forces responsible for separation [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : plcap])-([eq : fxslit ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : pl ] ] .",
    "even though neglecting many complexities present in the real problem , these estimates provide at least a qualitative understanding of the significantly different behavior of wettability induced forces upon a variation of the contact angle in a narrow slit as compared to open substrates .",
    "the analytic estimates given in section [ subsection : drivingforce ] are in qualitative agreement with lattice boltzmann computer simulations ( section [ subsection : simulation ] ) .",
    "in particular , on open substrate , a stronger gradient in laplace pressure is observed for the same difference in contact angle in the hydrophilic regime rather than in the hydrophobic one .",
    "such an effect is fully absent in the case of a planar slit , since the dependence of @xmath160 on the contact angle is symmetric upon a variation of @xmath45 around @xmath114 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : pl ] ] .",
    "using lattice boltzmann simulations , we also investigate the effect of a step - like wetting gradient on the motion of a droplet placed at the gradient zone in the absence of flow ( figs .",
    "[ fig : lbm_spreading_on_step_grad ] and [ fig : vfield ] ) .",

    "[ fig : lbm_spreading_on_step_grad ] ) .    via simple scaling arguments",
    "we also give an approximate expression for the characteristic time , @xmath198 , for the passage of a droplet over the wettability step in the absence of external forces .",
    "this time scale turns out to depend on the capillary time , the initial droplet volume as well as on the static contact angles of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts of the substrate [ eq .  ( [ eq : tav ] ) ] .",

    "( [ eq : tav ] ) yields the correct order of magnitude estimate of @xmath198 .    moreover , a study of the internal fluid dynamics yields interesting insight on how the fluid redistributes within the droplet in order to accommodate both the spreading dynamics and the lateral motion of the droplet towards the more hydrophilic part ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vfield ] ) .    it would be interesting to examine these computer simulation results in the light of experimental observations . owning to considerable difficulties in the observation of the local fluid motion ,",
    "such experiments have not been available yet .",
    "nevertheless , we are planing the use of tracers for visualization purpose and high speed cameras allowing to resolve the fast spreading dynamics of a fluid droplet on a step gradient .",
    "furthermore , the important role of droplet size as well as channel dimension for the separation process is underlined via analytic estimates [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : plcap])-([eq : fxslit ] ) ] and computer simulations [ figs .",
    "[ fig : sphericalcap_on_gradsurf ] and [ fig : liquidfilm_on_gradsurf ] ] . while the motion of smaller droplets is dominated by the action of wetting gradient induced forces , larger droplets tend to follow the external gravity - like force [ fig .",

    "a similar effect occurs in the case of a narrow slit ( fig .",
    "[ fig : liquidfilm_on_gradsurf ] ) . here , the effect of wetting gradient induced forces is weakened by an increase of the channel height ( vertical separation between the substrates ) thus further emphasizing the importance of surface / volume ratio for the separation efficiency .",
    "an important conclusion of our studies is that , both on open substrates and in closed planar channels , larger droplets are harder to guide by a step - wise wetting gradient than are the smaller ones . in the both",
    "studied geometries , the wetting gradient induced force decreases with droplet volume @xmath9 ( scaling as @xmath189 on open substrates and as @xmath199 in a planar slit ; @xmath130= channel height ) .    since the smallest droplet size is controlled by the dimensions of the emulsion generator ( see e.g.  fig .

    "fig : emulsion - generation ] ) as well as by the height of the planar slit , these observations suggest that a miniaturization of the channel would allow the generation and use of smaller droplets and thus could lead to a significant improvement of the separation efficiency .",
