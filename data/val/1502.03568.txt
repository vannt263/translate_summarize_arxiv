    "bright points ( bps ) are small - scale , roundish , dynamic structures observed in x - ray and extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) channels and have caused great concerns since their first discovery in rocket x - ray images by @xcite .",
    "@xcite found the bps had a spatial size of about 10@xmath6 km@xmath4 and a mean lifetime of 8 hr from the _ skylab _ x - ray images .",
    "@xcite observed bps in euv channels and found the bps showed large intensity variations in a few minutes .",
    "the bps are widespread throughout the whole solar atmosphere , e.g. , in the corona @xcite , the photosphere @xcite and the transition region @xcite .",
    "they are observed in active regions ( e.g. , ) , coronal holes , and quiet regions .",
    "being observed by different instruments in different wavelengths , they have been given many different names , for example , active - region transient brightenings , blinkers , coronal bps , microflares , nanoflares , x - ray bps , x - ray jets , etc .",
    "( see @xcite ) .",
    "although their physical nature is not fully understood , these small - scale phenomena may share similar physical processes .",
    "bps are found to be associated with dipolar magnetic fields @xcite , and the corresponding total flux surpass that of active regions @xcite .",
    "the massive energy involved in the bps , together with their widespread distribution among the solar surface , make small transient events heating mechanism a promising candidate in solving coronal heating problem .",
    "the idea of small reconnection events responsible for coronal heating was proposed by @xcite , and then developed by @xcite who suggested that the magnetic foot - point motion could form many small current sheets heating the corona via ohmic dissipation . from balloon - borne observations",
    ", @xcite discovered many small hard x - ray microflares with energies between @xmath7 ergs .",
    "@xcite suggested the bps observed in the euv line , which lied above the neutral lines of dipoles , were microflares and drivers of spicules .",
    "@xcite pointed out that if the power low index of energies distribution @xmath8 @xmath9 , large flares dominated the corona heating , otherwise small flares dominated .",
    "various studies have suggested the power law index lied in @xmath10 ( see @xcite )",
    ". statistical study of microflares in active regions by @xcite demonstrated these small transient brightenings had an energy range of @xmath11 ergs and a similar frequency distribution with larger hard x - rays flares . since the microflaring events in active regions could nt provide enough energy to heat the solar corona , new studies focused on the small events in the quiet sun .",
    "the microflares in the quiet corona were investigated by @xcite , who found these events have an occurrence rate of one per three seconds extrapolated over the solar surface and the thermal energy of every event is @xmath12 ergs .",
    "@xcite detected 281 flare - like events in the energy range of @xmath13 ergs in the 171   and 195   channels with the _ transition region and coronal explorer _",
    "( _ trace _ ; @xcite ) satellite .",
    "they found that these small flare - like events were miniature versions of larger flares in soft and hard x - rays and that their energy flux was a factor @xmath14 below the quiet coronal heating requirements . with the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _",
    "( soho ; @xcite ) observations , @xcite estimated that the energy input of euv microflares was about @xmath15 of the radiative output in the same region .",
    "@xcite analyzed the thermal and non - thermal properties of microflares which had a mean thermal energy of @xmath16 ergs at the time of peak emission in @xmath17 kev .",
    "the characteristics of microflares in coronal holes and in quiet regions are studied by and these microflares were found to share common characteristics to active region flares . with combined the _ solar dynamics observatory _ ( _ sdo _ ; @xcite ) and _ reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager _ ( _ rhessi _ ; @xcite ) observations , @xcite presented that 8 of 10 microflares studied were fitted by a uniform differential emission measure profile .    since @xcite suggested a nanoflare coronal heating theory , the efforts to search the smallest flare events has never been stopped . however , due to the small energy and the resolving capability of scientific instruments , the search and study of small flare - like events have never been satisfactory .",
    "it is necessary to examine the characteristics of microflares more carefully with higher resolution data .",
    "the launch of _ sdo _ provides us a brand new chance to study microflares with more elaborate temporal and spatial resolution . in this paper , we name these small - scale impulsive transient events observed in 171   as euv microflares , and focus on their statistical properties , spatial distribution as well as the relationship with small - scale magnetic fields .",
    "the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ; @xcite ) on board the _ sdo _ provides high resolution solar images with a pixel size of 0@xmath18.6 and a cadence of 12 s , while the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi ; @xcite ) provides 0@xmath18.5 resolution and 45 s cadence line - of - sight magnetograms uninterruptedly . in this study , we adopt aia 171   euv data and hmi line - of - sight magnetograms on 2010 july 20 , when there were no active regions on the solar disk . all the data we used have been applied differential rotation correction .",
    "firstly we select a quiet region with a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath19 around solar center , and then we visually track the microflares one by one in the region .",
    "finally we investigate the position , lifetime , area , brightness of the microflares respectively and determine the occurrence rate of them in latitudinal direction .",
    "totally 10794 microflares are traced in this work .",
    "a microflare is identified as follows : ( 1 ) we first employ the euv movies to find microflare - like events with impulsive enhancements as candidates .",
    "( 2 ) we select a square region for each event as carefully as possible to make sure that it can cover the target and does nt include any pixels belong to another one .",
    "most of the time , a square region works well , considering that the occurring rate of microflares is only @xmath20 mm@xmath21 hr@xmath2 ( 10794 microflares in the fov within 24 hr ) . however , there are still a few special cases when two events come too close . under these circumstances ,",
    "a square region will include pixels from another event , we refer to an irregular shape , which will be shown in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "( 3 ) we define an intensity enhancement as the difference of the integrated value in the square at the peak time and that at the time just before the event begins .",
    "a microflare event is confirmed if the intensity enhancement exceeds 3@xmath22 , where @xmath22 is the standard deviation of the integrated values in the square of each snapshot in the event process .",
    "once a microflare is confirmed , its lifetime , position , area , and brightness are recorded .",
    "the position is determined by the brightest point of a microflare at the peak time . in previous studies ,",
    "the area was often determined by the pixels exceeding a certain brightness level , which would fail for weak brightenings . considering the sharp gradients between the microflare and its background , we obtain the area of a microflare by summing up the pixels whose value surpass the mean value in the square at the peak time . to remove the projection effect ,",
    "the projected area is corrected to the real area by a @xmath23 factor , where @xmath8 corresponds to the heliocentric angle .",
    "the brightness is averaged over the area and normalized to that of the quiet sun ( @xmath3 ) , which is defined as the mean value of the whole image .",
    "we trace 10794 microflares totally in the chosen quiet region . for these microflares ,",
    "their position , lifetime , area , brightness and the occurrence rate in latitudinal direction are investigated .",
    "the relationship between the microflares and the underlying magnetic fields are also studied .",

    "there exist microflare - concentrated areas , as well as  void \" areas without microflares . as a result , the microflares form visible network patterns on the solar disk .",
    "although they occur unevenly in local regions , on the whole , the microflares still have an uniform distribution on the solar disk .",
    "we pick two typical regions with the fov of @xmath24 ( outlined by red windows  1 \" and  2 \" in panel ( a ) ) . within 24 hr ,",
    "only one microflare occurred in window  1 \" and 78 microflares appeared in window  2 \" .",

    "the right panel of figure  [ fig1 ] shows the distribution of microflares along the latitudinal direction . because the center of the fov lies in the north of the solar equator on july 20 ,",
    "the area in the south hemisphere is less than that in the northern hemisphere . with 5558 microflares in the southern hemisphere and 5236 in the northern one ,",
    "we get an occurrence rate of @xmath29 mm@xmath4 day@xmath2 in the southern hemisphere , and @xmath30 mm@xmath4 day@xmath2 in the northern hemisphere . in other words , over the whole sun , the number of microflares occurred in the southern hemisphere is 720 more than those occurred in the northern hemisphere for every hour .",

    "there is a peak located at 1.5 @xmath3 .",
    "as the brightness @xmath3 is obtained by normalizing the full disk , a microflare which takes place in dark background may have a brightness smaller than 1 @xmath3 .",
    "as revealed by panel ( a2 ) , the area of microflares covers from 1.2 mm@xmath4 to 88.2 mm@xmath4 , and is most concentrated in the level of 5.0 mm@xmath4 .",
    "similar to panels ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) , the histogram of lifetime is plotted in panel ( a3 ) .",

    "take panel ( b1 ) for example .",
    "firstly , we sort the area according to the brightness of individuals .",
    "secondly , the sorted data are divided into 19 groups with 540 elements each and one group with 534 elements .",

    "the statistical correlations reveal a tendency that the larger microflares have larger brightness and longer lifetimes .      to study the relationship between the microflares and the small - scale magnetic fields , we randomly select two regions , as shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .",

    "all the windows in the region are superimposed together to form a new image , as displayed in figure 4(a ) and 4(c ) .",
    "the right two panels display the corresponding magnetic fields , which are obtained by averaging over 30 magnetograms with a cadence of 15 min .",

    "after a detail check with the magnetograms , we find that the microflares are more concentrated in the magnetic cancellation regions , and hardly take place in the intranetwork regions , where many new small - scale magnetic elements emerge .    due to the superimposition of microflares in more than 7 hr in the left two panels of figure  [ fig4 ] , it is difficult to resolve individual microflares , especially in the dense regions like the region",
    "so we dissemble the region",

    "the number of microflares occurred for each time interval is given in the bottom - right of each panel .",
    "as mentioned in section 2 , the method of picking up microflares with square regions will fail for very special cases .",
    "panels ( b1)(b5 ) and ( c1)(c5 ) in figure  [ fig6 ] show two special examples how we deal with these situations . in panel",
    "( b ) , there were two microflares coming close in space and in time .",
    "so we employ an irregular shape instead of a square one to pick up one microflare so as not to include pixels from the other , which is shown in panels ( b1)(b5 ) .",
    "the methods of microflare identification and parameter determination are the same to those described in section 2 .",
    "as shown in panels ( c1)(c5 ) , two impulsive events  p1 \" and  p2 \" arose and merged with each other in their lifetime . as they could nt be distinguished and tracked individually ,  p1 \" and  p2 \" were treated as one microflare and investigated as a whole .",
    "together with microflares  2 \" and  3 \" , they are tracked with irregular shapes as mentioned above .",
    "thanks to the high - resolution data provides by _ sdo _ , we can distinguish microflares with lifetime as short as 48 s and with area as small as 1.2 mm@xmath4 . as a result , we observe 3.7 times microflares observed by @xcite ( 1200 hr@xmath2 ) .",
    "@xcite presented a statistical study of coronal bps and found the average size of a bp is 110 mm@xmath4 . identified 7 microflares in quiet regions whose area ranges from 8.4 mm@xmath4 to 22 mm@xmath4 . in our study , the area of microflares covers from 1.2 mm@xmath4 to 88.2 mm@xmath4 with a peak at 5.0 mm@xmath4 , which is much smaller than that in @xcite , but similar to that in .",
    "the typical lifetime of microflares was found to be 5  20 min .",
    "however , more than @xmath37 of the microflares we observed have a lifetime less than 5 min .",
    "the statistical correlations reveal a tendency that the larger microflares have higher brightness and longer lifetimes",
    ". however , the mutual positive correlation between brightness , area and lifetime may be not a welcome sign for smallest events detection .",
    "our results reveal that the microflares are prosperous in the magnetic cancellation regions of network boundaries and wilted in the intranetwork regions .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] suggests such a scenario : new magnetic elements emerge within the intranetwork region , move apart , and then interact with pre - existing network magnetic fields .",
    "the reconnection between newly emerged magnetic fields and pre - existing ones results in the microflares .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the converging flux model suggested by @xcite , which described how two approaching opposite polarities caused a null point that arose into the corona and formed a bp by magnetic reconnection .",
    "the ubiquity of microflares across the solar surface is crucial to the coronal heating .",
    "the network patterns exhibited by microflares distribution are similar to the magnetic network structures .",
    "however , whether the  void \" area without microflares is a true microflare - free zone or just a result of detection limitation can not be determined yet .",
    "higher resolution observations are needed to make a more careful examination .",
    "let s make a rough estimation of the energy flux of euv microflares in our observations .",
    "the occurrence rate is about @xmath1 hr@xmath2 extrapolated over the whole sun . taking the upper limit energy of microflares , i.e. , 10@xmath38 erg , then we get an average energy flux of about @xmath39 erg s@xmath36cm@xmath21 . however , the energy flux required for the coronal heating in the quiet sun is about @xmath41 erg s@xmath36cm@xmath21 .",
    "our result is still a factor of @xmath5 below the coronal heating requirement .",
    "we suggest there may exist a sea of nanoflares @xcite beneath the detection limit .",
    "there are also some studies @xcite suggesting that the events with picoflare energies may contribute to the coronal heating because of the insufficient energy of nanoflares . besides",
    ", the alfvn waves @xcite , which can transport magneto - convective energy upwards , have been invoked as another promising mechanism to heat the solar corona @xcite . @xcite",
    "have observed alfvn waves with sufficient energy in the chromosphere possibly to heat the solar corona .",
    "ubiquitous alfvn motions have also been observed in the transition region and in the corona by @xcite with the _ sdo _ satellite , although the generation and dissipation of these waves are still not clear .",
    "the ubiquitous rotating network magnetic fields ( rnfs ) and euv cyclones in the quiet sun suggested by @xcite may be another effective coronal heating mechanism . the field lines are braided by continuous developments of rnfs and then magnetic reconnection occurs in the braiding fields .",
    "thus the stored energy can be released to heat the corona , while the euv waves following the cyclones transport energy to other places .",
