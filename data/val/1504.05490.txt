    "the microscopic properties of strongly correlated many - particle systems emerging in solid - state physics are in general very hard to access experimentally @xcite .",
    "so how to simulate the properties of condensed - matter models using nontraditional controllable systems is highly desirable .",
    "recently , the investigation of quantum simulation in the photon - based many - body physics has received much attention in different systems @xcite .",
    "especially , there has been a great interest in mimicking quantum phase transition ( qpt ) of light with scalable coupled resonator array in the context of cavity / circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite , which provides a convenient controllable platform for studying the strongly correlated states of light via photonic processes . on the other hand",
    ", the artificially engineered hybrid devices can permit measurement access with unique experimental control @xcite ; and it is intriguing to employ a well - controllable quantum system with a tunable hamiltonian to simulate the physics of another system of interest .",
    "this paradigm has promoted many experimental / theoretical proposals on probing the light phase and opened various possibilities for the simulation of many - body physics .        in this work",
    ", we develop an optical system for engineering the strongly correlated effects of light in a hybrid solid - state system .",
    "we consider a @xmath0 square lattice of coupled tlrs @xcite , where each tlr is coupled to a single nv @xcite encircled by a persistent current qubit ( pcq ) .",
    "we show that the competition between the nv - pcq - tlr interaction and the nonlocal hopping induces the photonic localization - delocalization transition .",
    "subsequently the mott insulator ( mi ) phase and the superfluid ( sf ) phase can appear in a controllable way .",
    "the phase boundary in the case of photon hopping with real / complex - valued amplitudes can be obtained using the mean - field approach .",
    "also , the quantum jump technique is employed to describe the phase diagram when the dissipation is considered . finally , the possibility of observation of the qpt is discussed by employing experimentally accessible parameters .    in our architecture , one can tune independently the on - site emitter - field interaction and the nonlocal photonic hopping between adjacent tlrs .",
    "this permits us to systematically study the localization - delocalization transition of light in a complete parameter space .",
    "the main motivation for building such a hybrid system is to combine several advantages : _ in situ _ tunability of circuit elements @xcite , spectroscopic technology for state readout , peculiar characteristics of nv ( e.g. , individual addressing and long coherence time at room - temperature @xcite ) , and scalability of tlr arrays @xcite .",
    "recently , d. underwood _ et al _ experimentally fabricated 25 arrays of tlrs and demonstrated the feasibility of quantum simulation in circuit qed system @xcite .",
    "e. lucero _",
    "et al _ experimentally characterized a complex circuit composed of four phase qubits and five tlrs to realize intricate quantum algorithms @xcite .",
    "the progress renders the tlr lattice a good platform for studying condensed - matter physics with photons and makes our scheme to be more practical .",
    "as illustrated in fig . 1 , we consider a @xmath0 lattice of coupled tlrs , where the basic unit consists of a tlr coupled to a single nv encircled by a pcq , which acts as an interconnect to greatly magnify the nv - tlr coupling by several orders of magnitude , compared with the direct nv - tlr coupling ( far below the linewidth of tlr with dozens of @xmath1 ) resulting from the vacuum fluctuations of the photons @xcite .",
    "the tlr is made of a superconductor line interrupted by two capacitors at its ends . in the microwave domain , it can be treated as a quantum lc harmonic oscillator , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , where @xmath4 is the corresponding eigenfrequency with inductance @xmath5 and capacitance @xmath6 .",
    "the pcq located at an antinode of tlr s magnetic field is formed by a superconducting loop interrupted by three josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "when the loop is biased by half a magnetic flux quantum , the device is an effective two - level qubit made up of two countercirculating persistent currents with the hamiltonian @xmath7 .",
    "the nv can be modeled as a three - level system in the triplet ground - state subspace consisting of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the electronic gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath12 is the zero - field splitting , @xmath13 is a perpendicular magnetic field at the nv and @xmath14 is the spin-1-@xmath15 operator .",
    "the pcq magnetically couples to tlr via mutual inductance , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the magnetic dipole of pcq induced by the persistent circulating currents and @xmath18 is the magnetic field at pcq induced by the current in the central conductor of tlr .",
    "when @xmath19 , we have @xmath20 after rotating wave approximation , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 @xmath23 is the radius ( persistent circulating current ) of the pcq loop , and @xmath24 is the distance between pcq and central conductor of tlr .",
    "the sizable changes of magnetic flux within the loop induced by @xmath25 presented in the pcq lead to small shifts in the transition frequencies ( @xmath26 ) of nv @xcite . through this small change in magnetic field the pcq can couple to the nv via zeeman term , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .    the basic unit in our system is thus governed by the hamiltonian @xmath29 .",
    "the photonic tunneling in our model can be realized by a central coupler @xcite which serves as individual tunable quantum transducers to transfer photonic states between adjacent tlrs .",
    "we have presented a new paradigm for @xmath0 tlr lattice coupled to solid - state spins .",
    "we have shown that specially engineered resonator lattice provides a practical platform to couple both individual spin and superconducting qubit , and engineer their interactions in a way that surpasses the limitations of current technologies .",
    "this can provide new insights to many - body physics .",
    "we study the full hamiltonian of the @xmath0 square lattice by adding the on - site chemical potential and the nonlocal microwave photon hopping between adjacent sites .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 @xmath32 are photonic tunneling rates between resonators @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which are set by the tunable mutual capacitance @xmath35 between resonator ends with characteristic impedance @xmath36 and frequency shift @xmath37 due to random disorder @xcite . since @xmath38 , one can assume that @xmath39 without disorder for nearest - neighbor resonators , and @xmath40 @xmath41 for other resonator pairs .",
    "@xmath42 is the chemical potential at the @xmath33-th site .",
    "the conserved quantity in our system is the total number of excitations @xmath43 with @xmath44 @xmath45 the spin-@xmath46 ( -@xmath47 ) operators @xmath48 .",
    "the photon - dependent eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath49 is dressed states @xmath50 with the eigenvalues @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the eigenenergy of @xmath53 . here",
    "@xmath54 is the detuning , @xmath55 is the number of excitations in the resonator and @xmath56 @xmath57 . in our case , the dynamics",
    "is governed by the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) type of interaction , which enables the interconversion of qubit excitations and photons , and provides the effective on - site repulsion .",
    "meanwhile , pairs of tlrs are coupled by the two - site hubbard model via one - photon hopping . the difference between the bose",
    " hubbard model ( bhm ) @xcite and our model is that the conserved particles are the polaritons rather than the pure bosons in bhm , and the effective on - site repulsion @xmath58 decreases with the growth of photon number , and @xmath59 in the limit of large @xmath55 and @xmath60 , as shown in fig .",
    "2 , while it is a constant in bhm .",
    "the phase diagrams can be distinguished using the corresponding order parameters . * *  * * here we choose the sf order parameter @xmath61 ( set to be real ) to differentiate between insulator - like and sf - like states . using the mean - field theory @xcite we decouple the hopping term as @xmath62 @xmath63 , the resulting mean - field hamiltonian can then be written as a sum over single sites , @xmath64,\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the number of nearest neighbours . noting that @xmath66=0 $ ] , therefore , we can treat @xmath14 in the mean - field hamiltonian as a _",
    "_ c-__number and @xmath67 . minimizing the ground state energy of the hamiltonian @xmath68 with respect to @xmath69 for different values of @xmath70 and @xmath71",
    ", we obtain the mean field phase diagram / boundary in the @xmath72 plane when @xmath73 varies from the weak coupling regime @xmath74 to the strong coupling regime @xmath75 under the resonant / detuning case .",
    "the features of fig .",
    "3 are rich .",
    "the regime where @xmath76 corresponds to the stable and incompressible mi lobes characterized by a fixed number of excitations at per site with no variance . in each mi lobe , due to the nonlinearity and anharmonicity in the spectrum originating from the photon blockade effect @xcite , the strong emitter - field interaction leads to an effective large polariton - polariton repulsion which freezes out hopping and localizes polaritons at individual lattice sites . by contrast",
    ", strong hopping favours delocalization and condensation of the particles into the zero - momentum state , namely , @xmath77 indicates a sf compressible phase with the stable ground state at each site corresponding to a coherent state of excitations .",
    "analogous to the bhm , _ _",
    "_ _ the physical picture behind is that the mi - sf phase transition results from the interplay between polariton delocalization and on - site repulsive interaction .",
    "therefore , the phase boundary primarily depends on the ratio of the photon - hopping rate to the on - site repulsion rate .",
    "when the on - site repulsion dominates over hopping , the system should be in the mi phase , otherwise the system will be in the sf phase . from the expression of the parameter @xmath73 and @xmath78 , we can find that reduction of the size of the pcq loop will increase @xmath73 but decrease @xmath78 , and the adjustment of the distance @xmath24 only affects tlr - pcq interaction .",
    "furthermore , the detuning @xmath79 is also tunable by varying the magnetic field applied on nv . in fig .",
    "3 , one can find that the size of the mi lobes varies with @xmath79 , with the largest mott lobes found on resonance .",
    "further insight to the transition can be gained when the photon hopping with complex - valued amplitude exists in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , where the hopping process becomes @xmath80 with @xmath81 and we set @xmath82 we emphasize that this process is possible if the intermediate coupling elements are used to break time - reversal symmetry @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath83 provides a new regime in the dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "the sum of the tunneling phases along a closed loop surrounding the plaquette is @xmath84 , which is actually the flux quanta per plaquette . assuming that @xmath85s are all equal , the total hamiltonian under mean - field approximation reads @xmath86.\\end{aligned}\\]]the results are exhibited in fig .",
    "4 , we find that the boundary line gradually shifts to the right as @xmath85  enhances in the interval @xmath87 $ ] . because of the spatial variation of tunneling phase , the wave function of a polariton from one lattice site to another acquires a nontrivial phase ( _ aharonov - bohm _ phase ) @xcite , which actually reduces the effective hopping rates .",
    "generally , nonequilibrium processes such as dissipative effect , are crucial in solid - state devices .",
    "we show that the signature of the localization - delocalization transition remains even in the presence of the engineered dissipation by the quantum trajectory method qj .",
    "the non - hermitian hamiltonian is formulated as @xmath88where @xmath89 is the decay rate of tlr , and @xmath90 is the decay rate from the effective excited state @xmath91 to the continuum . here the dissipative effects of nv are negligible , compared with @xmath92 and @xmath90 .",
    "the phase diagrams under dissipative effects are displayed in fig .",
    "once the hopping rate is increased beyond a critical value , the system is expected to undergo a non - equilibrium qpt from a mi phase , where the initial photon population is self - trapped , to a sf phase with the dynamical photon population imbalance coherently oscillating between pairs of tlrs @xcite .",
    "furthermore , another obvious feature is that the size of mi phase becomes larger as the growth of dissipative rates .",
    "note that the effective nonlinearity at per site becomes stronger at lower exciton numbers , which implies that the dissipative effect ( inducing the decrease of the exciton numbers ) favours the mi phase . as a result",
    ", the dissipation results in the dynamical switching from sf phase to mi phase and causes the increment of the size of mi phase .",
    "firstly , we briefly stress the relevant experimental progress . from theoretical standpoint",
    ", it is possible to fabricate large arrays to observe many - body physics of interacting polaritons since resonators and qubits can be made lithographically @xcite . actually , it is indeed feasible to couple over @xmath93 ( or 1000 ) tlrs with negligible disorders ( on the order of a few parts in @xmath94 ) in a @xmath0 lattice using a @xmath95 sample or a full two - inch wafer houck .",
    "secondly , how to probe quantum many - body states of light is still an open question in photonic quantum simulation @xcite .",
    "the previous works @xcite suggested to measure the individual tlr through mapping the excitations into the qubit followed by state - selective resonance fluorescence spectrum , but a remaining technical challenge is the realization of high - efficiency photon detectors . alternatively , the local statistical property of tlr can be analyzed readily using combined techniques of photon - number - dependent qubit transition @xcite and fast readout of the qubit state through a separate low - q resonator mode @xcite , for which the high - efficiency photon detectors are not required .",
    "experimentally , transmission and reflection measurements for circuit qed arrays have been implemented successfully in small system with one or two resonators @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to distinguish between different phases of the system , one can also experimentally probe beyond transmission , such as two - tone spectroscopy and second - order coherence function ( photon statistics ) to reveal additional information .",
    "the tunability of coupling strengths in our system enables one to measure these quantities relatively straightforwardly .",
    "finally , we survey the relevant experimental parameters . given the flexibility of circuit qed , we can access a wide range of tunable experimental parameters for tlr - pcq coupling strength @xmath78 and hopping rate @xmath96 . taking @xmath97 @xmath98 , @xmath99 @xmath100 , @xmath101 @xmath102 , and @xmath103 @xmath104 , we get @xmath105 @xmath106 and @xmath107 $ ] mhz when the distance @xmath24 varies from @xmath108 @xmath104 to @xmath109 @xmath110 .",
    "furthermore , the hopping rate @xmath40 depends on the tunable mutual capacitance @xmath35 between resonator ends . in ref @xcite",
    ", the authors measured devices with photon hopping rates @xmath111 form @xmath112 mhz to @xmath113 mhz in resonators lattices . on the other hand , the electron - spin relaxation time @xmath114 of nv ranges from 6 ms at room temperature @xcite to @xmath115 s at low temperature @xcite .",
    "in addition , later experimental progress @xcite with isotopically pure diamond has demonstrated a longer dephasing time to be @xmath116 @xmath117 @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , the dissipation and decoherence of nv are negligible .",
    "we have devised a concrete hybrid system to engineer photonic mi - sf phase transition in a @xmath0 square lattice of tlrs coupled to a single nv encircled by a pcq .",
    "we find that the interplay between the on - site repulsion and the nonlocal tunneling leads to the photonic localization - delocalization transition . in the presence of dissipation",
    ", the phase boundary can be obtained by the mean - field approach and the quantum jump technique .",
    "facilitated by high levels of connectivity in circuit qed , experiments combining both scalability and long coherence times are expected in the coming few years , at that stage the investigation of photonic qpt using tlr lattice systems can therefore be easier to realize .",
