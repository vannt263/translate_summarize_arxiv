    "accretion powered x - ray binary pulsars which were discovered in the early 70s ( giacconi et al . 1971 ) , are among the brightest x - ray sources in sky .",
    "these binary systems consist of a neutron star with strong magnetic field ( @xmath5 gauss ) and a supergiant or a be star as optical companion .",
    "mass transfer from the companion star to the neutron star takes place through roche lobe overflow ( in case of low mass x - ray binaries such as her  x-1 , reynolds et al .",
    "1997 ) and/or capture of stellar wind ( in high mass x - ray binary systems ) .",
    "the accreted matter is channeled towards the magnetic poles of the neutron star by its strong magnetic field forming accretion columns from where the gravitational energy of accreted matter is being dissipated in the form of x - rays .",
    "most of accretion powered x - ray pulsars belong to the group of high - mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) systems .",
    "based on spectral and luminosity class of companion stars , the hmxbs are further classified into two subgroups such as ( i ) supergiant x - ray binary ( sgxb ) systems and ( ii ) be / x - ray binary systems . in case of sgxbs , the optical companion is an ob supergiant star whereas the be / x - ray binary systems associate with non - supergiant b - type stars which show balmer emission lines in their spectra .",
    "the energy spectra of accretion powered x - ray pulsars are generally described by phenomenological models consisting a power - law of photon index @xmath21 , high energy cut - off ( dal  fiume et al .",

    "as the pulsar is very weak in hard x - rays and there is background - like pattern in 100 - 150 kev source spectrum after background subtraction , it is likely that the hxd / gso background is underestimated for this @xmath0 observation . considering this",

    "for the first time , we report the possible detection of crsf at @xmath244 kev in this pulsar . based on this detection , the magnetic field strength at the neutron star surface",
    "is estimated to be @xmath23.8@xmath310@xmath4 gauss .",
    "it is seen that the values of crsf detected in accretion powered x - ray pulsars follow a continuum distribution starting from as low as @xmath211 kev for 4u  0115 + 634 ( nakajima et al .",
    "2006 ) to as high as @xmath276 kev for gro  j1008 - 57 ( yamamoto et al .",
    "nevertheless a crsf at @xmath2100 kev is reported in lmc  x-4 ( la barbera et al . 2001 ) , it is yet to be confirmed . considering the confirmed values of crsf in x - ray pulsars",
    ", the crsf detected in the pulsar 4u  1909 + 07 in present work falls in the higher side .",
    "it is to be noted that we report the detection of crsf at @xmath244 kev in the spectrum of 4u  1909 + 07 , obtained from a @xmath222 ks of exposure with hxd .",
    "@xmath0 observation with long exposure is required to confirm the presence of the absorption feature in this pulsar .",
    "the laxpc instrument of the upcoming @xmath48 mission will also provide a very good opportunity to establish the crsf feature in the slow hmxb pulsar 4u  1909 + 07 .",
