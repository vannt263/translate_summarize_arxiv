    "polyelectrolytes play an important role in industrial chemistry . the fields of application range from tailormade thickeners to paper finishing or ore preparation .",
    "polysaccharide derivatives represent one interesting class of polyelectrolytes . in particular ,",
    "cellulose products are important compounds . for our simulation study carboxy methyl cellulose ( cmc )",
    "is chosen as an example for a polyelectrolyte derived from a natural polymer .",
    "aqueous cmc solutions exhibit valuable properties , like a wide range of viscosity , non - toxicity and biodegradability . particularly for the high - purity consumer - product market ( cosmetics",
    ", food stuffs ) , cmc is used .",
    "however , pricing becomes more important in bulk applications ( clay and ore treatment , oil - drilling ) .",
    "hence it is desirable to replace some of the high - cost  high - selective chemicals with low - cost equivalents , like poly(acrylic acid ) ( paa ) , which is the prototype of industrial synthetic polyelectrolytes .",
    "paa is the other polymer studied in this work .",
    "most published work on aqueous cmc and paa solutions was done experimentally using chromatography  @xcite , @xmath6c  nuclear magnetic resonance  @xcite and rheological techniques  @xcite .",
    "theoretical approaches are scarce .",
    "we are aware of only one paper  @xcite , which treats cmc by the worm - like - chain theory .",
    "this electrostatic theory successfully rationalizes some of the global properties of cmc , but as a rather generic approach it does not allow for detailed predictions on an atomistic time and length scale .",
    "similar restrictions apply also to monte carlo simulations of polyelectrolyte chains in a cell model , where the solvent is treated as a dielectric continuum  @xcite .",
    "especially local interactions hydrogen bonds ( hydrogen bridges ) are neglected in theories and non - atomistic simulations . with two or three hydrogen - bond donor groups per repeat unit and even more acceptors sites ( including charged coo@xmath2 groups ) ,",
    "this type of interaction is likely to be very important for the behaviour of cmc in water .",
    "experimental techniques , on the other hand , suffer from different problems : nmr provides averaged local properties . rheology derives and verifies scaling laws , but different polyelectrolytes lose their chemical `` identity '' and show the generic behaviour of excluded - volume chains .",
    "atomistic molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations can not overcome all these problems , but they can provide some more detailed information .    the aim of this study is to understand better the structural and dynamic aspects of the hydration of cmc and paa and to compare the two polymers . to this end , we investiagate both the chain properties and the interaction of chains with their immediate solvent environment .",
    "atomistic simulation is confined to the study of small system sizes . however , in combination with coarse - graining methods  @xcite even some mesoscopic properties may be explored .",
    "thus , a second goal of this study was to produce atomistic structural information , from which coarse grained models of e.g. paa can be generated .",
    "the exact molecular composition of cmc is a consequence of the molecule s production history .",
    "usually oh - groups are randomly substituted by carboxy methyl units  @xcite and the degree of substitution ( ds ) for most commercial cmc s lies in the range ds=@xmath7@xmath8 substitutions per anhydroglucose unit ( agu ) .",
    "there is evidence for a preferential substitution during heterogeneous , wet conversion of cellulose to cmc : heinze and coworkers used liquid chromatography to analyse the substitution pattern of sodium - cmc .",
    "their analysis was preceded by hydrolysis of the glucosidic link , by which information on the ring - substitution sequence is lost . for the agu",
    ", the following substitution statistics was found  @xcite : 23   of all o2-oxygens were substituted , followed by the o6 ( 15 ) and o3 with 11  of all respective atoms .",
    "the glucose nomenclature is shown in figure  [ fig : agui ] .",
    "the diversity of molecular substitution patterns of cmc makes it difficult to model such a compound by an oligomer , because there is no `` typical '' molecule or structure .",
    "@xmath9{\\blafile}}\\ ] ]    to have at least some variety , two cmc oligomers were simulated .",
    "substitution patterns were generated at random , with weights for the three exocyclic oxygens ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) .",
    "they are summarized in table  [ tab : cmcsubst ] .",
    "the first molecule ( cmc  i ) consists of seven agus and is substituted five times , the second one ( cmc  ii ) consist of eight agus with six oh groups substituted .",
    "the degrees of substitution are ds=@xmath13 and ds=@xmath14 , respectively .",
    "due to three sites , at which substitution can take place ( neglecting the chain ends ) there are eight different possible substitution patterns on a single agu .",
    "four of these ( o2o3 , o3 , o2 , o6 ) are present in the first simulated cmc oligomer and one further pattern ( o3o6 ) in the second cmc oligomer .    @xmath15    all carboxylic acid groups were assumed to be dissociated , neutrality of the systems was maintained by five , respectively six sodium counterions . as the carboxylic acid group has a @xmath16 of about @xmath17 ,",
    "the system is basic .",
    "molecular weights are @xmath18amu ( seven  agus , cmc  i ) and @xmath19amu ( eight  agus , cmc  ii ) , respectively .",
    "molecule cmc  i was solvated in 3789 , molecule  ii in 3917 water molecules .",
    "the concentrations are about @xmath20 and @xmath21weight percent ( excluding the sodium - counterions )",
    ". therefore both simulations were performed in the dilute regime ( no added salt ) , where polyelectrolytes are expected to be stretched  @xcite .",
    "polyacrylic acid ( paa ) was modeled as one atactic oligomer strand , with @xmath22 repeat units ( @xmath23amu ) solvated in @xmath24 water molecules ( concentration excluding counterions @xmath21 weight percent ) .",
    "all coo@xmath2 groups are negatively charged and there are @xmath22 sodium counterions .",
    "runs were performed under the same conditions as for cmc , including the gromos force field  @xcite as detailed in table  [ tab : gromosnb ] and  [ tab : gromosbnd ] .",

    "figure  [ fig : comna]b shows that the first peak ( @xmath156 ) is dominated by na@xmath153 approaching the o2 oxygen of the cellulose moiety , whereas the second peak ( @xmath157@xmath34 ) arises from na@xmath153 ions near the carboxylic groups which , in cmc , are more remote from the centre of mass .",
    "both the ( dynamic ) flexibility of the carboxylate and the ( static ) different substitution patterns on different agus account for the large width of the second peak .",
    "cmc ii has a lower intensity , especially at short distance .",
    "this arises from its more compact structure which prevents counterions from approaching it freely from all sides .",
    "this behaviour is similar to what was already seen for the solute - solvent h - bonds .",
    "the rdf of poly(acrylate ) is better defined due to the larger number of counterion - monomer pairs .",
    "it shows a relatively sharp first maximum at about @xmath158 caused by na@xmath153 ions near the carboxylate and a broader second maximum ( @xmath159 ) possibly due to solvent - separated ion pairs .",
    "it is interesting to note that on average the cmc oligomer keeps much fewer counterions ( @xmath160 ) in its electrostatic vicinity ( distance to any atom of the polymer lower than the electrostatic screening length of the solvent @xmath161 ) than the paa oligomer ( @xmath162 ) , in spite of both being of similar molecular weight .",
    "this is caused by the difference in charge .",

    "even though poly(acrylate ) and carboxy methyl cellulose both are water - soluble polyelectrolytes , their behaviour in water and towards water differs markedly .",
    "this is due to the different charge density as well as to the different type and quality of hydrogen bonds that either forms with water . in paa , there is one strong hydrogen bond with the deprotonated carboxylate acting as an acceptor . in cmc ,",
    "the smaller density of carboxylates is only partly set off by the possibility of forming both donor and acceptor hydrogen bonds to the alcoholic oh groups of the cellulose .",
    "( hydrogen bonds to the ether oxygens are irrelevant . ) taken per molecular weight of the polymer , it seems safe to say that paa forms at least twice as many hydrogen bonds as cmc and that they are of larger binding energy ( charge - dipole , rather than , dipole - dipole ) . based on this argument , the solvation of paa in water should be more exothermic than that of cmc . unfortunately",
    ", no measurements appear to be available for comparison .",
    "the comparison of the two cmc oligomers shows that the particular carboxy methylation pattern has an immense influence on the local structure in solution .",
    "the two assume entirely different conformations : cmc  i is stretched and flexible , whereas cmc  ii remains in a rigid cyclic conformation .",
    "while it can not be ruled out completely that one molecule may not have reached equilibrium and may still be stuck in a local minimum , this is unlikely in view of the long simulation times of several nanoseconds . if there are metastable conformations they have to be long - lived .",
    "we are therefore left to conclude that industrial cmc with its statistical substitution of oh groups , behaves locally very diversely .",
    "as a consequence of its globular structure , cmc  ii shows more intramolecular hydrogen bonds than cmc  i , fewer hydrogen bonds to water , slower hydrogen bond dynamics , and fewer contacts with the counterions .",
