    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are close interacting binaries where a white dwarf primary accretes matter from a late - type main - sequence star . in absence of strong magnetic fields on the primary star ,",
    "an accretion disc is formed , where the matter transferred from the secondary star spirals inwards until it is accreted by the white dwarf . for a comprehensive overview on cvs see @xcite .    the general evolution from the detached binary to the semi - detached state of a cv , and the subsequent long - term evolution to shorter orbital periods",
    "is thought to be driven by orbital angular momentum losses due to gravitational radiation and magnetic braking .",
    "theoretical models based on this scenario imply that a cv should evolve down to an orbital period of @xmath02 h in less than 10@xmath1 yr .",
    "the evolutionary lifetime of cvs near the shortest period ( @xmath080 min ) should become drastically longer , as the thermal timescale of the secondary star becomes longer than the timescale of angular momentum loss by gravitational radiation .",
    "this behaviour should cause a `` spike '' in the orbital period distribution at the minimum period , as systems `` pile up '' at this point @xcite .",
    "the theoretical predictions for this minimum period range up to @xmath070 min @xcite .",
    "population synthesis calculations predict a space density @xmath010@xmath2 pc@xmath3 , with 99% of the cvs having periods shorter than 2 h , and 70% even having passed the turning point at the minimum period , with the now degenerate secondaries forcing an evolution towards longer orbital periods @xcite .",
    "however , there exists a strong mismatch between these predictions and the actually observed sample .",
    "observational estimates from large - area surveys derive a space density roughly a factor 10 lower than the predicted one ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the observed period distribution of cvs shows only about half of the sources to have an orbital period below the period gap @xcite .",
    "the minimum of the observed period distribution is at @xmath078 min , and there is no evidence of an enhancement in the number of sources close to this period ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "alternative evolutionary models have been proposed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more significantly , the strength of the magnetic breaking , which is one of the fundamental ingredients in the standard model , appears to be much weaker than assumed @xcite . however , the discrepancies described above can ( at least partly ) be the result of the observational biases affecting the sample of cvs , and this should be explored before discarding the standard ( and in other respects quite successful ) model .    in the standard model , the `` missing '' part of the population",
    "is thought to be dominated by low mass - transfer rate , short period dwarf novae , which are intrinsically very faint and show only very infrequent outbursts .",
    "especially the relatively bright magnitude cut - off of large - scale surveys conducted hitherto ( palomar - green , edinburgh - cape blue object survey : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) make them strongly biased against these systems @xcite .",
    "the low mass - transfer rate dwarf novae we are looking for are expected to have a fairly blue continuum and strong hydrogen emission lines ( see , e.g. , fig . 6 in",
    "this emphasises the importance of using deep spectroscopic and photometric surveys for a systematic search for cvs .",
    "first results from such surveys have become available recently ( e.g. , the hamburg quasar survey and the sloan digital sky survey ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) .    starting in 1996 ,",
    "we have conducted a survey of candidate cvs selected from the caln - tololo survey ( cts ; see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the cts has been designed to search for emission - line galaxies , quasars and galaxies with strong uv excess using objective prism plates .",
    "the spectra cover the wavelength range from @xmath05300  down to the atmospheric cut - off .",
    "the survey includes 5150 deg@xmath4 , i.e.  @xmath5 of the whole sky , in the southern hemisphere with @xmath6 .",
    "the typical limiting magnitude of the plates is @xmath718.5 .",
    "about half of the cts plates ( @xmath02100 deg@xmath4 ) had been examined in 1996 , and those sources showing a blue continuum and hydrogen emission lines were selected as candidate cvs , yielding a sample of 59 objects .",
    "follow - up observations identified 21 targets as definite cvs , including 16 previously unknown systems of which 4 cvs have been independently discovered by other surveys in the meantime @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present detailed data for those cvs that show photometric modulations we believe to reflect the orbital periods . in future papers we will present time - resolved spectroscopy for the remaining cvs without",
    "previously known periods , and discuss the complete sample .",

    "the spectroscopic data were taken at the danish 1.54 m and the eso / mpi 2.2 m telescopes .",
    "after bias and flatfield correction the spectra were calibrated in wavelength using helium - neon ( 1.54 m telescope ) and helium - argon ( 2.2 m telescope ) lamps .",
    "flux calibration was performed with respect to standard stars observed in the same night . the flux calibrated spectra were folded with @xcite filter curves to obtain photometric magnitudes . by comparison with the values derived from the acquisition frames ( typically an exposure in the v or r filter ) we determined the slit losses .",

    "ctcv j2354@xmath134700 was observed on two subsequent nights .",
    "[ j2354lc_fig ] presents the resulting light curves , and table [ j2354ecl_tab ] lists the times of mid - eclipse which were obtained by fitting a second order polynomial to the eclipse data .",

    "linear fits , excluding the humps and eclipses , yielded slopes of 1.05(49 ) mag d@xmath20 and 2.59(24 ) mag d@xmath20 for the 1996 - 10 - 03 and the 1996 - 10 - 04 data , respectively . since on both dates",
    "the average magnitudes are very similar , it is clear that at least the value for the first night does not reflect the system s behaviour over a longer period of time .",
    "therefore , either the cv has undergone some slow , non - orbital , variations between the two nights , or the decline ( perhaps in both nights ) is artificial . for the 1996 - 10 - 04 data the airmass has been continuously increasing ( from 1.05 to 1.58 ) , and 3 of the 5 stars in the average comparison light curves are very red with @xmath21 , raising the suspicion that the decline may be due to differential extinction . however , light curves for the target computed with respect to the bluest ( @xmath22 ) and the reddest ( @xmath23 ) comparison star yield nearly identical decline rates .",
    "computing the difference light curve of the two comparison stars with the most extreme colour coefficient we do find the signature of differential extinction in the form of a decline of @xmath00.1 mag d@xmath20 for both nights ( in the first night , the standard deviation of the slope even still includes a constant light curve ) . in the average light curve",
