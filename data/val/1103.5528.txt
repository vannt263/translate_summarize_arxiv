    "morse theory is one of the most important tools to understand the topology of manifolds . a modern approach to the morse theory ,",
    "morse - smale - witten complex has been very popular as its infinite dimensional application , floer homology theory , has proven to be a very powerful tool in the area of symplectic and differential geometry .",
    "morse - smale - witten complex is a free module generated by critical points of a morse function graded by their indices , and the differential on this complex is given by counting ( signed ) number of gradient lines between critical points of index difference one .",
    "the notion of a differentiable orbifold was introduced by satake @xcite in the fifties under the name v -manifold , as a natural generalization of the notion of differentiable manifold .",
    "an effective orbifold is a space which is locally the quotient space of a smooth manifold by the effective action of a finite group .    in this paper , we develop morse - smale - witten complex for effective orbifolds .",
    "morse functions are given by invariant functions whose local lift is morse .",
    "morse theory on orbifolds , such as morse inequalities or informations about local morse data has been known for a while since the work of lerman - tolman @xcite .",
    "but the construction of morse - smale - witten complex has not been available .",
    "we construct such a complex , and show that its homology is isomorphic to the singular homology of the quotient space ( with certain assumptions ) .",
    "there are a few interesting differences from the case of manifolds .",
    "the first one is that a broken trajectory ( assume only one breaking ) may be a limit of several different families of smooth trajectories , whereas for manifolds , there exist only one family of smooth trajectories converging to such a broken trajectory .",
    "this is because there can be several different lifts of broken trajectories , which are not equivalent via local group action and we analyze them carefully in section 4 .",
    "the second one is that one should count with suitable weights to define a chain complex depending on the order of related isotropy groups .",
    "namely , each gradient trajectory , which was counted as one in the case of manifolds , should be counted with weights depending on the stabilizer of the end points and that of trajectory itself .",
    "most interesting of all is probably that one has to discard certain critical points ( namely unorientable critical points ) and consider a subcomplex generated by only orientable critical points , to define morse - smale - witten complex .",
    "this is related to the observation , already in @xcite that when the local group action does not preserve the orientation of the unstable directions , then there exists no change of topology when passing through such a critical point .",
    "one drawback is that it is known to be very difficult to study morse - smale condition(transversality between any unstable and stable manifolds of critical points ) together with the local invariance condition .",
    "for example , morse functions on orbifolds are dense among smooth functions ( by @xcite , @xcite ) but they may not be morse - smale . hence throughout the paper , we only consider the case when the given function is indeed morse - smale .",
    "it is also difficult to carry out an analogue of the usual invariance proof of the homology of the chain complex due to such issues .",
    "( we hope to return to this issues in the future research . ) instead , we will prove that the homology is isomorphic to the singular homology of the quotient space .",
    "the work of dixon , harvey , vafa and witten on string theory on orbifolds@xcite , and the discovery of new ring structure on cohomology of inertia orbifolds by chen and ruan@xcite , and orbifold gromov - witten invariants @xcite , has prompted many exciting new developments on the study of orbifolds in the last decades .",
    "but the fukaya category theory on orbifolds has not been developed yet .",
    "this paper lays a foundation to define orbifold fukaya category theory .",
    "namely , we expect that the new phenomenons which appeared in this paper on morse theory should also be present in orbifold fukaya category theory , and they should be dealt in a similar way as in this paper .",
    "we hope to explore this elsewhere jointly with mainak poddar .",
    "we remark that for toric orbifolds , lagrangian floer theory for smooth lagrangian torus fibers has been developed in @xcite .",
    "we also remark that the equivariant cohomology version of morse - bott theory has been defined by austin and braam @xcite for compact ( connected ) lie group @xmath0 , but their construction does not immediately generalize for finite @xmath0 unless the group action preserves the orientation of critical submanifolds and orientations of unstable directions .",
    "we consider local coefficient system on each critical submanifolds from the determinant bundle of normal directions , and take an invariant subcomplex ( where invariance involves local coefficients ) to define a morse - smale - witten complex in such a case .",
    "this gives a correct analogue of their construction of equivariant cohomology morse - bott complex in the case of finite group @xmath0 .",
    "here is the outline of the paper . in section 2 , the case of global quotient is developed with careful examination of orientation issues . in section 3",
    ", we reformulated the construction of section 2 in a more intrinsic form .",
    "in section 4 , we define a morse - smale - witten complex for effective orbifolds and show that @xmath1 . in section 5 ,",
    "we compare the homology of morse - smale - witten complex with singular homology of the quotient space . in section 6",
    ", we consider the case of non - orientable manifolds and also morse - bott case .",
    "let @xmath2 be a closed oriented connected manifold and suppose the finite group @xmath0 acts on @xmath2 effectively in an orientation preserving way . set @xmath3 to be the global quotient orbifold @xmath4 and denote by @xmath5 the quotient space and @xmath6 the natural projection to the orbit space .",
    "by @xcite , we can take a @xmath0-invariant morse function @xmath7 .",
    "suppose further that @xmath8 is morse - smale with respect to a @xmath0-invariant metric . in this section ,",
    "we construct a morse - smale - witten complex for @xmath9 , where @xmath10 .",
    "a more general morse - bott case will be discussed later , but we explain this case here for the introduction and to present a clearer picture on orientation issues .",
    "we begin by recalling that morse homology of orbifolds has been studied by lerman and tolman @xcite , where they analyzed the local morse data near a critical point in orbifold setting and proved morse inequalities for orbifolds .",
    "the equivariant cohomology complex of @xmath2 with respect to @xmath0-action in terms of morse theory has been defined by austin and braam in @xcite using cartan model together with morse - bott complex , when @xmath0 is compact connected lie group .",
    "( see remark [ abrelation ] for more discussions on this ) .",
    "although it is not stated in @xcite , they implicitly assume that @xmath0 is connected compact lie group , because first , they are using cartan model , and second they do not discuss orientation issues of the group action , which becomes trivial for connected lie group actions .",
    "in fact , as we will see , the orientation issues are very important even to set up morse - witten - smale complex for finite group actions .",
    "even though the group action is assumed to preserve the given orientation of manifold , it may not preserve the orientation of unstable directions .",
    "the critical points of @xmath11 will be divided into two types , orientable and non - orientable critical points ( see definition [ def : type ] below ) .",
    "we will discard the non - orientable critical points and show that invariant chains in the complex made of orientable critical points define morse homology of the orbifold @xmath3 .",
    "we recall that a smooth function on orbifold by definition has smooth invariant lift on each uniformizing chart .",

    "also , denote the set of all critical points of @xmath8 with index @xmath28 by @xmath29 , for simplicity .",

    "indeed , we will see later that attaching cells which arise at non - orientable critical points do not contain any topological information for the quotient space ( see corollary [ disk ] ) .",

    "recall that the standard morse homology argument to show @xmath197 uses the compactifications of moduli spaces of negative gradient flow lines between critical points whose index difference is @xmath198 .",
    "the same analysis still works on the uniformizing covers , but there is a crucial difference . as illustrated in the figure a given broken trajectory ( representing @xmath199 ) on @xmath5 can become limits of several smooth flow trajectories ( different even after the local group action ) .",
    "this can be easily seen as in the following example .",
    "let @xmath148 be the negative gradient flow lines from @xmath49 to @xmath145 and @xmath200 be the one from @xmath145 to @xmath201 .",
    "assume @xmath202 , for simplicity .",
    "then , on an uniformizing neighborhood @xmath174 , there are @xmath203-flow lines which lift @xmath148 and also @xmath203-flow lines which lift @xmath200 .",
    "choose @xmath70 , @xmath204 to be one of the flow trajectories covering @xmath148 and @xmath200 in the cover @xmath175 .",
    "for each @xmath205 , the choice of lifts @xmath206 together with @xmath207 gives another broken trajectory in the cover .    in this way",
    ", we find @xmath208-broken trajectories of the lifting @xmath8 of @xmath11 in @xmath209 and hence , we have @xmath208-families of smooth gradient flow lines converging to each of @xmath208-broken trajectories in @xmath175 . since @xmath168-action on the set of broken trajectories in @xmath175 is free and",
    "so is on the set of ( local ) gluings in @xmath175 , we get @xmath210-families after quotient by @xmath168-action .",
    "we see that there are @xmath203 different families of smooth trajectories converging to a single broken trajectory @xmath211 near @xmath145 in this case .",
    "recall that the convergence of 1-parameter family of negative gradient flow lines to a broken trajectory is given as uniform convergence in locally compact subsets . also , the standard gluing lemma which guarantees that there exists an 1-parameter family of flow lines which converges to the given broken trajectory is also carried out locally .",
    "so , these facts are still true for general orbifolds .",
    "we are going to use these facts freely .    for effective orbifolds ,",
    "gradient vector fields can be studied in the following way , which we learned from e. lerman . for any orbifold @xmath3 ,",
    "its frame bundle @xmath212 is a smooth manifold with a smooth , effective , and almost free @xmath213-action .",
    "then , @xmath3 is naturally isomorphic to the quotient orbifold @xmath214 ( theorem 1.23 of @xcite ) . or consider any manifold @xmath2 and compact lie group @xmath0 with @xmath215 with smooth , effective , almost free @xmath0-action .",
    "then , we can lift our morse function @xmath216 to a function @xmath217 simply by setting @xmath218 .",
    "note that the critical submanifolds of @xmath219 typically look like @xmath220 for @xmath221 , @xmath20 .",
    "the hessian of @xmath219 along the normal direction to the critical submanifold @xmath93 precisely equals to that of @xmath11 at @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the lift @xmath222 is morse - bott .",
    "thus , the properties of gradient trajectories in @xmath2 are already well - known ( see@xcite ) including analytic properties of gradient trajectories of @xmath219 such as convergence , gluing and so on .",
    "this implies the desired properties for gradient trajectories of @xmath11 .",
    "another way to define morse - smale - witten complex for an orbifold @xmath3 would be to use @xmath0-equivariant morse - bott complex for @xmath222 . as discussed in remark",
    "[ abrelation ] , the construction in @xcite provides such a complex if the assumptions of @xcite are met , such as critical submanifolds are orientable , @xmath0-action preserves orientations of unstable and stable manifolds , and the submersiveness of evaluation maps from the trajectories .",
    "even when all these conditions are met , the complex in @xcite uses cartan model of @xmath223 , and it is not clear what is the relation of the differential there and geometric counting of gradient flow - lines . for @xmath24 or @xmath224-coefficients ,",
    "the @xmath0-equivariant cohomology of @xmath2 in this setting is isomorphic to the singular homology of @xmath4 ( proposition 2.12 @xcite ) .",
    "hence it would be interesting to find a relation between the construction of @xcite and the construction in this paper in the above setting .",
    "consider the moduli space of gradient flow trajectories between critical points of index difference two , which is of dimension one .",
    "the above example illustrates that the compactified moduli space in this case topologically , near each broken trajectory , is given by a join of several copies of interval @xmath225 at @xmath226 s equipped with a @xmath168 action .",
    "also note that before compactification , the moduli space should be understood as an orbifold as the trajectories lies in the uniformizing covers with group actions on them .",
    "we also remark that the orbifold structures of each limiting trajectories to a given broken trajectory may not be isomorphic to each other in non - abelian cases .",
    "to prove the main theorem , we first prove a couple of lemmas on stabilizers of the gradient flow trajectories .",
    "first , we set the notations as follows : consider @xmath227 .",
    "note that @xmath145 and @xmath228 are not assumed to be orientable .",
    "let @xmath148 ( resp .",
    "@xmath229 ) be negative gradient flow lines from @xmath49 to @xmath145 ( resp .",

    "take the set of flows lines in the above 1-parameter family and call it @xmath232 .",
    "even if @xmath232 flows between two orientable critical point ( and hence will be oriented as we shall see below ) , breaking points ( either @xmath145 or @xmath228 ) of limiting broken trajectories are not necessarily orientable .",
    "this is the reason why we did nt impose any condition on the orientability of @xmath145 and @xmath228 .",
    "indeed , example [ broken heart ] already shows this phenomenon .",
    "we shall see that , however , each of limiting broken trajectories has a well defined sign as a boundary of @xmath232 .",

    "hence , we can give @xmath243 an orbifold structure locally as a suborbifold of @xmath3 .",
    "this does not depend on the choice of @xmath235 by lemma [ flow ] . and the resulting orbifold is oriented as we consider flows between orientable critical points as explained in section 2 .",
    "now we show that stabilizers are isomorphic to each other .",
    "but this is clear , since any connected one dimensional orientable orbifold satisfies such a property since a finite group action on an interval say @xmath247 is either identity or @xmath248 up to diffeomorphism .",
    "but the latter can not be orientation preserving .",
    "hence local groups act trivially and hence the stabilizers are isomorphic to each other .",
    "next , we consider compactification @xmath249 of each component @xmath232 by adding limit broken trajectories @xmath211 , @xmath250 to @xmath232 .",

    "also , it carries a natural orientation . as in the standard morse theory ,",
    "this can be used to prove that the natural orientation at the boundary broken trajectories of @xmath279 are opposite to each other . to be more precise , we introduce a sign rule for  boundary \" of @xmath280 .",
    "we will in fact show that @xmath257 inherits a sign rule from @xmath257 .",
    "namely , we have :    for @xmath281 , define @xmath282 as the product of @xmath283 and @xmath284 . whether @xmath145 is orientable or not , @xmath168-action on @xmath257 preserves @xmath285 .",

    "since @xmath49 and @xmath145 are both orientable , exactly the same argument in lemma [ cancel ] shows that @xmath287 and @xmath288 .",

    "so , the orientation of broken trajectories @xmath211 as a boundary of any component of @xmath232 converging to it is given by @xmath293 .",
    "consequently , the orientation issue of @xmath280 can be rephrased as follows :    if there is an one parameter family @xmath243 which corresponds to @xmath292 $ ] and @xmath294 $ ] in the sense of lemma [ cp ] , @xmath295 $ ] and @xmath296 $ ] should be opposite .    as we said , the proof is not different from the classical one at all .",
    "( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "this sign cancellation is the base of proving @xmath129 in smooth case .",
    "but , to count gradient flow trajectories and to describe cancellation phenomenon in orbifold case correctly , we should take a weighted sum to take into account the orbifold structure .",
    "for the compactification @xmath279 as above , the following expression will be called the weighted boundary of @xmath279 : @xmath297 } { |g_{[\\gamma , \\delta]}| } ( \\bar{\\gamma } , \\bar{\\delta } ) + \\dfrac{\\epsilon[\\gamma ' , \\delta']}{|g_{[\\gamma ' , \\delta']}| } ( \\bar{\\gamma } ' , \\bar{\\delta}').\\ ] ] we call the numbers @xmath298 } { |g_{[\\gamma , \\delta]}| } $ ] , @xmath299}{|g_{[\\gamma ' , \\delta']}|}$ ] the weights and write them as @xmath300 , @xmath301 , respectively .",

    "also note that the limiting flows to a fixed broken trajectory might have non - isomorphic stabilizers by lemma [ bdy ] .",
    "so we can not really think of @xmath303 as orbifold with boundary .",

    "the sign or orientation of @xmath553 $ ] is determined simply by the following equality of oriented vector spaces : @xmath556 where @xmath557 and the flow line @xmath70 runs from @xmath523 to @xmath558 .",
    "the sign of @xmath532 is exactly described as the orientation of the left hand side . since @xmath559 has a canonical orientaion ( in negative gradient direction ) , the orientation on @xmath560",

    "then , for a non - orientable critical points @xmath565 , consider the element with orientation , @xmath566 .",
    "non - orientability of @xmath27 implies that some @xmath567 ( in fact half of @xmath568 ) reverses the orientation @xmath548 , and hence , the average of @xmath569 via @xmath568 in fact vanishes .",
    "thus @xmath569 is not an element of @xmath570 .",
    "hence , @xmath570 agrees with our earlier invariant morse complex when @xmath8 is morse .",
    "i.e. we have @xmath571 where @xmath572 denote the set of elements preserving or reversing orientation , respectively .",
    "now , we show that the homology of @xmath573 is isomorphic to the singular homology of @xmath4 with the assumption that @xmath8 is furthermore self - indexing .",
    "we first recall the compactification of unstable manifolds of @xmath8 in @xcite . for a critical submanifold @xmath574 of index @xmath28 ( @xmath575 ) and a sequence @xmath576 , define @xmath577 where the index of points in @xmath578 is @xmath579 . naively , @xmath580 is a product of @xmath581 with the moduli space of broken trajectories passing through @xmath582 to @xmath583 .",
    "[ cpt ] ( lemma 3.3 of @xcite ) the unstable manifold @xmath584 can be compactified so that @xmath585 here , the codimension of the stratum @xmath586 in @xmath587 is exactly @xmath588 .",
    "the compactified space has the structure of a manifold with corners .",
    "moreover , there is a natural immersion @xmath589 of the @xmath590 into @xmath2 , which is not injective nor proper in general .",
    "for example , the immersion of @xmath591 restricted on the boundary component @xmath586 is just the projection from @xmath586 to the last factor @xmath592 .",
    "also we have @xmath593 for @xmath594 , let @xmath595 from our generecity assumption , this define a current on @xmath2 .",
    "note that @xmath596 since the element of @xmath597 also contains the information of the local orientation of fiber of @xmath598 around the image of simplex , say @xmath548 , @xmath599 defines an orientation on @xmath600 .",
    "therefore , we get a map @xmath601 sending @xmath602 . here , we regard @xmath603 as a singular chain complex of @xmath2 generated by currents .",
    "consider @xmath606 and @xmath607 , one of generators of @xmath608 .",

    "we will only check the identify as a set , and the check on orientation can be done without difficulty .",
    "so we will simply write @xmath511 instead of @xmath532 .",
    "the left hand side can be written as @xmath610 \\times_{s ' } { w^- ( s')}\\ ] ] on the other hand , @xmath611 here , only codimension @xmath377 boundary components of @xmath612 appear since we are considering them as currents .",
    "the map @xmath613 is induced by @xmath614 .",
    "now , the identification easily follows by considering the diagram .",
    "since @xmath604 is @xmath0-equivariance , we get a map @xmath615 by restricting original @xmath604 , where @xmath616 denotes @xmath0-invariant singular chains in @xmath2 . from now",
    "on , assume further that the morse - bott function @xmath8 satisfies the self - indexing condition .",
    "i.e @xmath617 .",
    "then , we get a filtration of complex @xmath616 as follows .",
    "let @xmath618 .",
    "each @xmath619 is @xmath0-invariant and gives a filtration on @xmath616 , @xmath620 where @xmath621 . for @xmath552 ,",
    "we take the following filtration : @xmath622 where @xmath623 means the fiberwise orientation sheaf on @xmath624 .",
    "we are going to show that @xmath604 induces an isomorphism between the homology groups of associated graded complexes of @xmath552 and @xmath616 .",
    "since our complexes are bounded , spectral sequences of @xmath552 and @xmath616 ( with respect to the filtrations given above ) will converge to associated graded groups of homologies .",
    "thus if we can prove @xmath604 induces an isomorphism between @xmath410-terms of spectral sequences which are homology groups of associated graded complexes of @xmath552 and @xmath616 , then we will get the desired result .",
    "let @xmath626 and @xmath627 they are precisely the @xmath410-terms of our complexes .",
    "the homology of the first complex is simply the @xmath0-invariant relative homology group of the pair @xmath628 .",
    "i.e. @xmath629 for @xmath630 , define @xmath631 .",
    "@xmath632 s are @xmath0-invariant , obviously and hence there is natural @xmath0-action on @xmath632 . combining theorem [ br ] and excision , we get : @xmath633 ( the gradient flow defines a deformation retract of the pair @xmath628 onto @xmath634 and hence , a retract between pairs of @xmath0-quotients . )    thus , what we are left with is to show the following morphism of chain complexes induces the isomorphism on homology groups of them : @xmath635 keeping track of our isomorphisms used above , one can find that this map is defined as @xmath636 we again emphasize that chain @xmath511 contains information of the coherent orientation of the fiber of @xmath637 and that the genericity condition on @xmath511 guarantees the well - definedness of this map .",
