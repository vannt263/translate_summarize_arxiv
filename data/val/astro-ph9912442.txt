    "polars , as amhers are commonly named due to their highly polarized emission , consist of a late type main - sequence star ( red dwarf , secondary star ) and a highly magnetized white dwarf ( wd , primary star ) .",
    "the red dwarf , filling its roche volume , injects matter through the @xmath2 point into the roche volume of the wd . unlike in non - magnetic systems",
    ", this material does not form an accretion disc , but couples onto the magnetic field once the magnetic pressure exceeds the ram pressure . from this stagnation region ( @xmath3 ) on",

    "the secondary star gradually eclipses the accretion stream during the inferior conjunction . using tomographical methods ,",
    "it is  in principle  possible to reconstruct the surface brightness distribution on the accretion stream from time resolved observations .",
    "this method has been successfully applied to accretion discs in non - magnetic cvs ( `` eclipse mapping '' , horne @xcite ) .",
    "we present tests and a first application of a new eclipse mapping code , which allows the reconstruction of the intensity distribution on the accretion stream in magnetic cvs .",
    "marks the inner lagrangian point , @xmath3 the position of the stagnation or coupling region.,width=332 ]    similar attempts to map accretion streams in polars have been investigated by hakala @xcite and vrielmann and schwope @xcite for . an improved version of hakala s @xcite method has been presented by harrop - allin et al .",
    "@xcite with application to real data for the system @xcite .",
    "a drawback of all these approaches is that they only consider the eclipse of the accretion stream by the secondary star . in reality",
    ", the geometry may be more complicated : the far side of the magnetically coupled stream may eclipse stream elements close to the wd , as well as the hot accretion spot on the wd itself .",
    "the latter effect is commonly observed as a dip in the soft x - ray light curves prior to the eclipse ( e.g. sirk and howell , 1998 ) .",
    "the stream - stream eclipse may be detected in data which are dominated by emission from the accretion stream , e.g. in the light curves of high - excitation emission lines where the secondary contributes only little to the line flux .    here , we describe a new accretion stream eclipse mapping method , using a 3d code which can handle the full complexity of the geometry together with an evolution strategy as fit algorithm .",
    "we present extensive tests of the method and map as a first application to real data the accretion stream in uzfor emission of @xmath11550 .",
    "our computer code cvmod generates @xmath5 small surface elements ( convex quadrangles , some of which are degenerated to triangles ) , which represent the surfaces of the individual components of the cv ( wd , secondary , accretion stream ) in three - dimensional space ( fig .",
    "[ f_overview ] ) . using simple rotation algorithms , the position of each surface element @xmath6 can be computed for a given orbital phase @xmath7 .",
    "the _ white dwarf _ is modelled as an approximated sphere , using surface elements of nearly constant area @xcite . the _ secondary star _",
    "is assumed to fill its roche volume . here",
    ", the surface elements are choosen in such a way that their boundaries align with longitude and latitude circles of the roche surface , taking the @xmath2-point as the origin .",
    "we generate the surface of the _ accretion stream _ in two parts , ( a ) the ballistic part from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , and ( b ) the dipole - part from @xmath3 to the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "\\(a ) for the ballistic part of the stream , we use single - particle trajectories .",
    "the equations of motion in the corotating frame are given by @xmath8 equation ( [ m_method_2c ] ) has been added to flannery s @xcite set of two - dimensional equations .",
    "@xmath9 is the mass fraction of the white dwarf , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the distances from the point @xmath12 to the white dwarf and the secondary , respectively , in units of the orbital separation @xmath13 .",
    "the coordinate origin is at the centre of gravity , the @xmath14-axis is along the lines connecting the centres of the stars , the system rotates with the angular frequency @xmath15 around to the @xmath16-axis .",
    "the velocity @xmath17 is given in units of @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the initial velocity in the @xmath2 point .    if @xmath20 , the trajectories resulting from the numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ m_method_2a ] )  ( [ m_method_2c ] ) are restricted to the orbital plane .",
    "however , calculating single - particle trajectories with different initial velocity directions ( allowing also @xmath21 ) shows that there is a region approximately one third of the way downstream from @xmath2 to @xmath3 where all trajectories pass within very small separations , corresponding to a striction of the accretion stream .",
    "we define a 3d version of the stream as a tube with a circular cross section with radius @xmath22 centred on the single - particle trajectory for @xmath23 .",
    "\\(b ) when the matter reaches @xmath3 , we switch from a ballistic single - particle trajectory to a magnetically forced dipole geometry .",
    "the central trajectory is generated using the dipole formula @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the angle between the dipole axis and the position of the particle @xmath26 .",
    "this can be interpreted as the magnetic field line @xmath27 passing through the stagnation point @xmath3 and the hot spots on the wd .",
    "knowing @xmath27 , we assume a circular cross section with the radius @xmath28 for the region where the dipole intersects the ballistic stream .",
    "this cross section is subject to transformation as @xmath25 changes .",
    "thus , the cross section of the stream is no longer constant in space but bounded everywhere by the same magnetic field lines .",
    "our accretion stream model involves several assumptions : ( 1 ) the cross section of the stream itself is to some extent arbitrary because we consider it to be  for our current data , see below  essentially a line source .",
    "( 2 ) the neglect of the magnetic drag @xcite on the ballistic part of the stream and the neglect of deformation of the dipole field cause the model stream to deviate in space from the true stream trajectory .",
    "while , in fact , the location of @xmath3 may fluctuate with accretion rate ( as does the location of the earth s magnetopause ) , the evidence for a sharp soft x - ray absorption dip caused by the stream suggest that @xmath3 does not wander about on time scales short compared to the orbital period .",
    "( 3 ) the abrupt switch - over from the ballistic to the dipole part of the stream may not describe the physics of @xmath3 correctly .",
    "this discrepancy , however , does not seriously affect our results , because the eclipse tomography is sensitive primarily to displacements in the times of ingress and egress of @xmath3 which are constrained by the absorption dip in the uv continuum ( and , in principle , in soft x - rays ) .",
    "the @xmath29 time bins of our observed light curves correspond to @xmath30 in space at @xmath3 .",
    "hence , our code is insensitive to structure on a smaller scale .",
    "in fact , the smallest resolved structures are much larger because of the noise level of our data .",
    "while our approach clearly involves several approximations , it is tailored to the desired aim of mapping the accretion stream from the information obtained from an emission line light curve .    in our current code",
    ", we restrict the possible brightness distribution so that for each stream segment , which consists of 16 surface elements forming a section of the tube - like stream , the intensity is the same , i.e. there is no intensity variation around the stream .",
    "for the current data , this is no serious drawback , since we only use observations covering a small phase interval around the eclipse .",
    "our results refer , therefore , to the stream brightness as seen from the secondary . from the present observations we can not infer how the fraction of the stream illuminated by the x - ray / uv spot on the wd looks like .",
    "the required extension of our computer code , allowing for brightness variation around the stream , is straightforward .",
    "the present version of the code is , however , adapted to the data set considered here .",
    "the basic idea of our eclipse mapping algorithm is to reconstruct the intensity distribution on the accretion stream by comparing and fitting a synthetic light curve to an observed one .",
    "the comparison between these light curves is done with a @xmath31-minimization , which is modified by means of a maximum entropy method .",
    "sections [ lcg ] describes the light curve generation , [ ctp ] the maximum entropy method , and [ tfa ] the actual fitting algorithm .      in order to generate a light curve from the 3d model ,",
    "it is neccessary to know which surface elements @xmath32 are visible at a given phase @xmath7 .",
    "we designate the _ set of visible surfaces _ @xmath33 .",
    "in general , each of the three components ( wd , secondary , accretion stream ) may eclipse ( parts of ) the other two , and the accretion stream may partially eclipse itself .",
    "this is a typical hidden surface problem .",
    "however , in contrast to the widespread computer graphics algorithms which work in the image space of the selected output device ( e.g. a screen or a printer ) , and which provide the information ` pixel @xmath34 shows surface @xmath32 ' , we need to work in the object space , answering the question ` is surface @xmath32 visible at phase @xmath7 ? ' . for a recent review on object space algorithms see dorward @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there is no readily available algorithm which fits our needs , thus we use a self - designed 3d object - space hidden - surface algorithm .",
    "let @xmath5 be the number of surface elements of our 3d model . according to dorward @xcite",
    ", the time @xmath35 needed to perform an object space visibility analysis goes like @xmath36 .",
    "our algorithm performs its task in @xmath37 , with the faster results during the eclipse of the system .",
    "it is obviously necessary to optimize the number of surface elements in order to minimize the computation time without getting too coarse a 3d grid .",
    "once @xmath33 has been determined , the angles between the surface normals of @xmath38 and the line of sight , and the projected areas @xmath39 of @xmath38 are computed . designating the intensity of the surface element @xmath32 at the wavelength @xmath1 with @xmath40 , the observed flux",
    "@xmath41 is @xmath42 here , two important assumptions are made : ( a ) the emission from all surface elements is optically thick , and ( b ) the emission is isotropic , i.e. there is no limb darkening in addition to the foreshortening of the projected area of the surface elements .",
    "the computation of a synthetic light curve is straightforward .",
    "it suffices to compute @xmath41 for the desired set of orbital phases .",
    "while the above mentioned algorithm can produce light curves for all three components , the wd , the secondary , and the accretion stream , we constrain in the following the computations of light curves to emission from the accretion stream only .",
    "therefore , we treat the white dwarf and the secondary star as dark opaque objects , screening the accretion stream .      in the eclipse mapping analysis ,",
    "the number of free parameters , i.e. the intensity of the @xmath5 surface elements , is typically much larger than the number of observed data points .",
    "therefore , one has to reduce the degrees of freedom in the fit algorithm in a sensible way .",
    "an approach which has proved successful for accretion discs is the maximum entropy method mem @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to define an image entropy @xmath43 which has to be maximized , while the deviation between synthetic and observed light curve , usually measured by @xmath44 , is minimized ( @xmath45 is the number of phase steps or data points ) .",
    "let @xmath46 be @xmath47 the default image for the surface element @xmath32 .",
    "then the entropy is given by @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ e_mem - default ] ) , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the positions of the surface elements @xmath32 and @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath51 determines the range of the mem in that the default image ( [ e_mem - default ] ) is a convolution of the actual image with a gaussian with the @xmath52-width of @xmath51 .",
    "hence , the entropy measures the deviation of the actual image from the default image . an ideal entropic image ( with no contrast at all ) has @xmath53 .",
    "we use @xmath54 for our test calculations and for the application to uzfor .",
    "the quality of a intensity map is given as @xmath55 where @xmath1 is chosen in the order of 1 .",
    "aim of the fit algorithm is to minimize @xmath56 .",
    "our model involves approximately 250 parameters , which are the intensities of the surface elements .",
    "this large number is _ not _ the number of the degrees of freedom , which is difficult to define in a mem - strategy .",
    "a suitable method to find a parameter optimum with a least @xmath31 and a maximum entropy value is a simplified imitiation of biological evolution , commonly referred to as ` evolution strategy ' @xcite .",
    "the intensity information of the @xmath32 surface elements is stored in the intensity vector @xmath57 .",
    "initially , we choose @xmath58 for all @xmath32 .",
    "> from this parent intensity map , a number of offsprings are created with @xmath59 randomly changed by a small amount , the so - called _",
    "mutation_. for all offsprings , the quality @xmath56 is calculated .",
    "the best offspring is selected to be the parent of the next generation .",
    "an important feature of the evolution strategy is that the amount of mutation itself is also being evolved just as if it were part of the parameter vector .",
    "we use the c - program library evoc developed by k. trint and u. utecht from the technische universitt berlin , which handles all the important steps ( offspring generation , selection , stepwidth control ) .",
    "in contrast to the classical maximum entropy optimisation @xcite , the evolution strategy does not offer a quality parameter that indicates how close the best - fit solution is to the global optimum . in order to test the stability of our method",
    ", we run the fit several times starting from randomly distributed maps .",
    "all runs converge to very similar intensity distributions @xmath57 ( see also figs .",

    "this type of test is common in evolution strategy or genetic algorithms ( e.g. hakala 1995 ) .",
    "even though this approach is not a statistically ` clean ' test , it leaves us to conclude that we find the global optimum .",
    "fastest convergence is achieved with 40 to 100 offsprings in each generation .",
    "finding a good fit ( @xmath44 ) takes only on tenth to one fifth of the total computation time , the remaining iterations are needed to improve the smoothness of the intensity map , i.e. to maximize @xmath43 . a hybrid code using a classical optimization algorithm ,",

    "as long as @xmath60 , our algorithm achieves , as in the first test , a good reconstruction of the input map .",
    "the bright regions next to @xmath3 appear darker than in the original map , since the intensity from that region is spread over the last part of the ballistic stream and the neighbouring parts of the dipole stream , which dissapear behind the limb of the secondary star nearly simultaneously during ingress .",
    "comparing the two tests for @xmath61 , we find that it is still possible to distinguish between the two different initial intensity distributions ( one bright region and ` zebra ' ) even with such a noisy signal .    in table",

    "the increase of @xmath44 from @xmath62 to @xmath63 with the decrease of @xmath64 shows once more how well the fit algorithm works : for the light curve with no noise , the ideal light curve has  by definition  @xmath65 .",
    "as soon as noise is added , even the input light curve has a @xmath66 , which follows also from the definition of @xmath31 if @xmath52 is the real standard deviation of the data set . for the calculation of @xmath31 ,",
    "one needs a sensibly chosen standard deviation @xmath52 .",
    "since the light curves of polars show pronounced flickering , we calculate an approximate @xmath52 for our noisy data sets ( synthetic and measured ) by comparing the data with a running mean over 10 phase steps .",
    "the running mean has , thus , a reduced @xmath31 of @xmath67 .",
    "since the best fit to artificial data with low synthetic noise levels does better than the running mean , we obtain @xmath68 for these light curves .    the entropy @xmath43 of the images is always close to 1 .",
    "an ideal entropic image would have @xmath53 , the actual values of @xmath69 come very close to that .",
    "one would not expect @xmath53 , since that would imply that there is no variation in the image , i.e. , all surface elements have the same brightness .",

    "hence , all parts of the accretion stream which are not eclipsed during this phase interval can not emit light in @xmath11550 .",
    "for the assumed geometry of uzfor , parts of the northern dipole stream remain visible throughout the eclipse .",

    "region 3b has to be understood as an artifact : during orbit 1 , the observed flux level at maximum emission line eclipse ( @xmath112 ) does not drop to zero . hence , our algorithm places intensity on the surface elements of the accretion stream which are still visible at that phase .",

    "another possibility is that the matter is decelerated near @xmath3 , resulting in an increase in the density .",
    "this may result in an increase of the continuum optical depth , and , therefore , in a decrease of the @xmath11550 equivalent width .      on the dipole section of the stream , we find two generally different emission regions : the bright and small region above the stagnation point and the broader regions near the accretion poles of the white dwarf .",
    "_ near the accretion spots : _ [ s_disc_accspot ] on the magnetically funneled stream , we find one region of line emission ( 3 ) which we assume to be due to photoionization by high - energy radiation from the accretion spot .",
    "the mirror region 3b is an artifact which is created by the mapping algorithm to account for the non - zero flux level in orbit 1 in the phase interval @xmath112 ( see sect . [ results ] ) .",
    "even though the distribution of emission on the accretion stream does not reflect the irradiation pattern in a straigthforward way , the presence of emission at a certain location of the stream requires that this point is irradiated , if there is no other mechanism creating line emission . in fig .",
    "[ f_dipol ] , we define the angles @xmath118 and @xmath119 and the distances @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "assuming a point - like emission region at the accretion spot , the absorbed energy flux per unit area caused by illumiation from the accretion regions varies as @xmath122 .",
    "the structure of this equation shows that the illumination of the accretion stream is at maximum somewhere between the accretion region and the point with @xmath123 .",
    "this corresponds to the brightness distribution which we derive from the data .",
    "we suggest the following interpretation of the emission region _ above the stagnation point _ : independent of whether the emission in this region is due to photoionozation or collisional excitation , a higher density than in other sections of the stream is required .",
    "matter which couples in @xmath3 onto the field lines has enough kinetic energy to initially rise northward from the orbital plane against the gravitational potential of the white dwarf .",
    "if the kinetic energy is not sufficient to overcome the potential summit on the field line , the matter will stagnate and eventually fall back towards the orbital plane , where it collides with further material flowing up .",
    "this may lead to shock heating with subsequent emission of @xmath11550 .",
    "alternatively , the photoinization of the region of increased density may suffice to create the emission peak . yet",
    "another possibility is that the matter is heated by cyclotron radiation from the accretion column which emerges preferentially in direction perpendicular to the field direction .",
    "crude estimates show , however , that the energy of the cyclotron emission does not suffice to produce such a prominent feature as observed .",
    "a detailed understanding of the emission processes in the accretion stream involves a high level of magnetohydrodynamical simulations and radiation transfer calculations , which is , clearly , beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have successfully applied our new 3d eclipse mapping method to uzfornacis . in subsequent research we will allow additional degrees of freedom in the mapping process , using data sets with higher s / n and covering a larger phase interval .    our attempts to image the accretion stream in polars should help in understanding the physical conditions in the stream , such as density and temperature . by comparison to hydrodynamical stream simulations , we will take a step towards the complete understanding of accretion physics in polars .",
    "we thank hans - christoph thomas for discussions on the geometry of the accretion stream , andreas fischer for general comments on this work , andr van teeseling for ideas to test the algorithm and an anonymous referee for the detailed and helpful comments .",
