    "note that an important assumption in this comparison is that of a constant bias .",
    "it was argued recently that modified gravity theories generically lead to a scale - dependent bias  @xcite , an effect we are currently quantifying using our simulations .",
    "the modified gravitational law in standard dgp follows from the graviton propagator @xmath23 , where @xmath4 sets the cross - over scale from the 4d ( @xmath2 ) to the 5d ( @xmath3 ) regime .",
    "while the more complicated nature of the force law in higher - dimensional degravitation models does not lend itself to such a simple form for the propagator , a useful parameterization is  @xcite , [ prop ] with standard dgp corresponding to @xmath24 .",
    "this power - law parameterization is not only simple in form , but it also makes contact with the far infrared limit of the cascading / degravitation propagator : since these models all have @xmath25 space - time dimensions , the force law scales as @xmath26 in the far infrared , corresponding to a propagator that tends to a constant ( @xmath27 ) or behaves as @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) as @xmath30 .",
    "thus all higher - dimensional extensions of dgp correspond to @xmath31 theories in the infrared  @xcite .    in this work , therefore , we shall be primarily interested in @xmath32 and @xmath33 , corresponding respectively to standard dgp and cascading / degravitation models .",
    "more generally , @xmath34 is a free parameter within the allowed range @xmath35 .",

    "in this work we shall ignore these scalars and focus exclusively on @xmath8 . )    as emphasized above , this longitudinal mode is responsible for nearly all of the interesting phenomenology of the models considered here . at the linearized level , it contributes an additional @xmath36 to the one - particle exchange amplitude between conserved sources , which at first sight would seem grossly to violate solar system constraints  @xcite .",
    "as vainshtein  @xcite realized , however , the weak - field approximation is invalid for the longitudinal mode in the vicinity of astrophysical sources . instead , non - linearities in @xmath8 become important and result in it decoupling from matter on scales smaller than a macroscopic scale given by  @xcite r_= ( r_c^4(1-)r_sch)^1/(1 + 4(1- ) ) , [ rstar ] where @xmath37 is the schwarzschild radius of the source . for @xmath24",

    "the leading correction to the newtonian potential is  @xcite .",

    "[ modpot ] the above parametric dependence is fixed by two requirements : @xmath40 that @xmath8 be of order @xmath41 at @xmath42 , to match the linear solution ; @xmath43 that the solution be analytic in @xmath44 for @xmath39 .",
    "equation  ( [ modpot ] ) shows that , as desired , @xmath8 leads to a small correction to the newtonian potential for @xmath39 . thus non - linearities lead to a decoupling of @xmath8 and recovery of einstein gravity locally .    for @xmath45 ,",
    "on the other hand , @xmath8 yields a correction of order unity , ._rr _ = . [ weak ]",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath8 contribution to the exchange amplitude mentioned earlier .",
    "thus one can think of the helicity-0 mode as mediating a scalar fifth force which is suppressed near high density sources but becomes relevant at astrophysically large distances .",
    "this is precisely the opposite of a fifth force mediated by a massive scalar field , where the yukawa potential fades away at distances larger than the compton wavelength .",
    "the @xmath8 behavior instead closely resembles that of the @xmath9 scalar field  @xcite under the chameleon mechanism  @xcite .",
    "indeed we will see that many of our results share qualitative features of n - body simulations of @xmath9 gravity  @xcite .",
    "the key point is that @xmath38 , while large for astrophysical sources , is nevertheless parametrically smaller than @xmath4 .",
    "quantitatively , a @xmath46 galaxy has a vainshtein radius of @xmath47 for @xmath48 with @xmath11 . for a @xmath49 galaxy cluster ,",
    "this gives @xmath50 .",
    "given these scales , we expect @xmath8 to play an important role in structure formation .",
    "the infrared modifications of gravity discussed above should translate in the cosmological context into corrections to the expansion history .",
    "this is certainly the case in the standard dgp scenario , where the friedmann equation receives an added contribution proportional to @xmath51  @xcite . by virtue of being linear in @xmath52",
    ", however , this correction results in too large a deviation from @xmath0cdm expansion history , leading to significant tensions with current data  @xcite .",
    "the situation is much more hopeful in higher dimensional models .",
    "as argued in  @xcite , for general @xmath34 theories we expect power - law corrections to the friedmann equation of the form h^2 = + - . [ modfried ] ( recall that in this work we focus exclusively on the so - called  normal \" branch , as opposed to the self - accelerated branch , hence the choice of minus sign on the right hand side . the  plus \" branch version of this equation was introduced in  @xcite to study generalized self - accelerated solutions . )",
    "in particular ,  ( [ modfried ] ) agrees with the standard dgp friedmann equation  @xcite for @xmath32 .",
    "more importantly , we immediately see that @xmath33 ( corresponding to 2 or more extra dimensions ) leads to an expansion history identical to that of @xmath0cdm cosmology .",
    "of course , a complete understanding of higher - codimension cascading gravity models will inevitably uncover small departures in their expansion history compared with @xmath0cdm , as they do not exactly correspond to @xmath11 .",
    "but @xmath11 should offer a realistic approximation to their modified friedmann equation since we expect the departures to be a slowly - varying function of @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "in light of these considerations , in this work we therefore assume that _ the expansion history is identical to that of @xmath0cdm cosmology .",
    "_ this has the virtue of disentangling the effects due to a modified growth history , which is our primary interest . and",
    "while this is only justified for higher - dimensional cascading models , we also assume a @xmath0cdm background expansion for dgp , so that our simulations can enlighten us on the @xmath34-dependence of the modified growth history .      for the purpose of n - body simulations",

    "we propose a phenomenological extension of these results valid for general @xmath34 theories , which reduce to the equations of  @xcite in the dgp case .",
    "the change in the perturbation equations can be entirely encoded as a scale - dependent modification to the poisson equation : ( + @xmath53 ^ 2)= -4 g | \\ { ( 1- ) } _ k , [ modpoisson ] where @xmath54 measures the overdensity @xmath55 in units of @xmath4 , = 8g^2r_c^2|= 8g^2h^2r_c^2_m .",

    "this mass term has been neglected in most earlier studies of dgp cosmological perturbations  @xcite , except in  @xcite , presumably because @xmath4 was assumed to be of order @xmath58 . in this work , however , we shall consider much smaller values for @xmath4 , and the mass term can not be dropped . *",
    "the correction factor on the right hand side of  ( [ modpoisson ] ) encodes the  fifth force \" mediated by the longitudinal mode @xmath8 .",

    "the analysis of  @xcite , on which the above results are based , assumes spherical top - hat perturbations . for general perturbations ,",

    "ongoing n - body simulations in dgp by r.  scoccimarro have established that a spherical approximation yields a power spectrum that agrees well with the full calculation  @xcite . *",
    "implicit in our modified poisson equation is some coarse - graining for the density field .",
    "otherwise , since @xmath54 is formally a delta function for a point particle , our modification would vanish everywhere in this extreme case .",

    "we should stress that the above expressions only hold well inside the horizon , which is of course all we care about for our simulations . in dgp , for instance , the corrections to general relativity take on a rather different form on super - hubble scales , as shown by  @xcite and  @xcite in the self - accelerated and normal branch , respectively .    the generalization of  ( [ lin ] ) for near- and super - hubble modes , and the implications for large - scale growth history , has been studied recently in  @xcite . in particular , it was shown that modified gravity can explain the lack of cmb temperature correlation on @xmath74 angular separations  @xcite , provided that the curvature perturbation @xmath75 is conserved on all relevant scales .",

    "the physics is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sketch ] , where the solid lines labeled by @xmath76 and @xmath77 denote the hubble horizon and graviton compton wavelength , respectively .",
    "at early times , @xmath78 , gravity is approximately standard on all scales since @xmath79 .",
    "once @xmath52 drops below @xmath1 , however , the scalar force mediated by the longitudinal mode kicks in , and perturbations experience enhanced growth , at least on sufficiently small scales .",
    "thus we expect excess power on small scales compared to what is expected in @xmath0cdm , at least until they reach large overdensities .    on large scales ,",

    "our numerical solutions were performed by modifying a publicly available particle mesh n - body code  @xcite ; a modification of the same original code was used in  @xcite for other modified gravity models . while many more accurate methods for computing the formation of large scale structure now exist for standard gravity , the particle mesh approach is actually better suited to the modification of gravity we consider here .",
    "this is because our modification , like the particle mesh approximation , does not accurately capture the two point interaction between any two of the gravitating n - bodies . on the contrary",
    ", its implicit spherical top - hat assumption only works over fairly long distance averaging scales , where the coarse - grained picture it relies on is a good approximation of reality .",

    "the result of that transformation is then converted into fourier space .",
    "the effect of the change on the left hand side is even simpler . since we have the fourier space version of the left hand side , we simply use it to solve for @xmath87 , albeit using the green s function appropriate for the discrete fourier transform that appears in the code .",
    "as written , our modified poisson equation  ( [ modpoisson ] ) does not have a smooth continuum limit : as we increase the resolution of our simulation , the nonlinearities of the equation will cause a larger and larger fraction of the mass in the universe to be screened . fortunately , however ,  ( [ modpoisson ] ) is an approximation to an underlying equation of motion which _ does _ have a smooth limit .",
    "as described in  appendix [ decoup ] ,  ( [ modpoisson ] ) is exact for homogeneous density , but gives a poor approximation in very sparse regions and whenever a significant fraction of the matter lies in high - density regions .",

    "the parameter adjustments necessary are listed in table  [ smithparams ] of appendix  [ smithfit ] . because the difference between the dgp and cascading / degravitation simulations is small over the range of our simulations",

    "this result at first appears to disagree with another study , @xcite , that found good agreement between halofit and a variety of weak modifications to gravity , including a phenomenological model that mimicked the dgp scalar that is also our focus .",
    "their work , however , focused on the case where the change in the scalar force was explicitly correlated to an alteration of the expansion history , and where it mediated a repulsive force .",
    "this constrained their modification of the growth rate to be relatively small and to work against , rather than in concert with , the newtonian force .",
    "for very large values of @xmath4 , our model also recovers standard gravity smoothly , and for the large values of @xmath4 considered in @xcite , we would similarly find much better agreement with the halofitting algorithm .",
    "another important question is how the growth history depends on @xmath34 .",
    "figure  [ dgpvdeg ] shows the relative difference between power spectra for degravitation / cascading ( @xmath121 ) and dgp ( @xmath57 ) model .",
    "the difference between them are only a few percent over the scales probed by the simulations and are thus smaller than the variance in the simulations , which are suppressed in the plot .",
    "this can be seen most clearly in the results from the linearized perturbation theory results ( dash - dotted lines ) .",
    "the one clear difference that is evident both in the linearized results and in the simulations is that the difference between the two values of @xmath34 is more pronounced for smaller @xmath4 , which is sensible .",
    "the dependence of our results on the graviton compton wavelength is simpler .",
    "smaller @xmath4 leads to more power on intermediate scales , but reaches the  cut off \" beyond which gravity ceases to operate at larger @xmath16 . as is implicit in fig .",
    "[ vdata ] , over the scales we simulate and for the relatively small difference in values of @xmath4 we consider , a simple linear rescaling is all that is necessary to account for the difference in @xmath4 .",

    "[ modpoisson ] and the equations governing linear perturbation growth ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",

    "it will also fail , along with the rest of our approximations , as we go to high @xmath16 where vainshtein screening becomes systematically large .",
    "besides further elucidating how our phenomenological model depends on its input parameters , this result demonstrates that it would be possible in principle for cosmological observations to discriminate between different kinds of higher dimensional gravity theories , since the differences between their predictions can be quite pronounced , especially on very large length scales .",
    "the vainshtein screening effect in our class of models arises in two ways : @xmath40 through a _",

    "[ antiv ] . to disentangle these two effects",
    ", we performed an additional set of simulations where , instead of using  ( [ modpoisson ] ) as the modified poisson equation , we used its linearized form given in  ( [ lin ] ) .",
    "the latter does not include the vainshtein screening from local overdensities , only from the cosmological background .",
    "in other words , this comparison allows us to isolate the effects from local vainshtein screening .",
    "the results of this comparison in a representative simulation box are shown in fig .",
    "[ chameleon ] .",
    "the results for each simulation box  and the combined power spectra  were similar , but focusing on a single box allows us to see the changes due to the local vainshtein effect .",
    "the main take - away message from this figure is that the power is greater without the local vainshtein effect , as expected intuitively .",
    "more interestingly , the power excess is larger for @xmath6  mpc then for 300  mpc .",
    "indeed , for larger @xmath4 , non - linearities in @xmath8 are more easily triggered , hence the local vainshtein screening is more effective .",
    "quantitatively , local screening requires a large overdensity in units of @xmath4 , that is , @xmath125 . and from  ( [ eps ] )",
    ", @xmath125 is easier to achieve for larger @xmath4 .",
    "( of course , for much larger values of @xmath4 , such that @xmath126 , the global vainshtein screening would still be effective today , and the local vainshtein effect would therefore be irrelevant . )    going back to fig",
    ".  [ chameleon ] , the reason that the difference between the two simulations goes to zero past the half nyquist frequency is because the simulations cease to give a valid determination of the power spectrum beyond that point .",
    "intuitively , we expect that the reason why these highest frequency modes have more power in the linear simulation is because of the enhanced kinetic energy of the particles in that simulation : since the mesh can not resolve the inter - particle potential on small scales , we can see that in simulations with stronger gravity that the two particle correlation falls off more quickly than in simulations where gravity is weaker on smaller length scales .      as discussed in secs .",
    "[ cp ] and [ continuum ] , our modified poisson equation  ( [ modpoisson ] ) requires averaging the density field .",
    "since the equation depends non - linearly on @xmath67 , one might have expected our results to depend on the coarse - graining scale . as discussed in ",
    "[ continuum ] , the relevant scale is set by the grid resolution .",
    "therefore , we can quantify the dependence on the scale of averaging by comparing simulations of different resolution .",
    "figure  [ res ] shows that degrading the resolution of runs by a half , both in grid size and in particle number , results in a @xmath127% change in power .",
    "most importantly , the difference is smallest over the intermediate length - scales where our simulations are most accurate .",
    "this demonstrates that the short distance , high - density screening discussed in   [ continuum ] is not propagating its effects to these length scales .",
    "indeed , we even see that the finer grid  which resolves more high density structures in a universe with hierarchical clustering  has _ more _ power on small scales than the coarse grid , whereas the effect of spurious screening would be to decrease the power present at higher resolution .",
    "the relatively poor fit of our simulation power spectra to the sdss data shown in fig . [ vdata ] should not cause alarm .",
    "this is due to several factors , most obviously that our chosen cosmological parameters were chosen for model comparison purposes , not to fit these data .",
    "also , our simulations , which contain only dark matter , will necessarily match real data poorly .",
    "with regard to data , the most obvious difference between the modified and standard models is that the bias needed for the modified gravity models to fit these data is very different from the typical bias parameter  56% ( 67% ) for 300 ( 500 ) mpc relative to that needed for the standard gravity results .",
    "this is a natural consequence of our model s enhanced gravitational strength ; its consequences bear further study . at the present ,",
    "the theory of bias in modified gravity models has yet to be worked out .",
    "the study bias in these models is complicated by the fact that they introduce scale dependence into the growth factor .",
    "there are also indications in related work  @xcite that a more complete phenomenology of a massive / resonance graviton model may require a more subtle treatment of super - horizon evolution",
    ". both of these effects will introduce scale dependence into the bias .",
    "a more pressing concern for these models comes from recent precision weak lensing measurements  @xcite .",
    "these observations observe a power spectrum normalization of @xmath128 on @xmath129 angular scales , in good agreement with the wmap measurement  @xcite : @xmath130 .",
    "this would appear at first to rule out a significant boost in power spectrum amplitude from modified gravity .",
    "however , lensing data are not so easy to interpret in the context of our modified gravity model , and do not provide a strong constraint on it as yet .",
    "a simple way to see this is to compare with the results in  @xcite , which studies the consequences for weak lensing of adding a mass term in the poisson equation .",
    "this is of course very different from the density - dependent modifications considered here . nevertheless , as can be seen from the growth factor shown in their fig .  1 ,",
    "our class of models is mimicked reasonably well by their yukawa potential with @xmath131 and inverse mass @xmath132  mpc ( similar to our @xmath38 ) . using these values , we see that , according to their fig .",
    "2 , this model is as yet in no conflict with the weak lensing data .",
    "furthermore , because of the bias issues discussed above , the comparison with the sloan luminous red galaxies also shown in their fig .",
    "2 should be ignored .",
    "another subtlety to keep in mind is that weak lensing observations are sensitive to a different gravitational potential , usually denoted by @xmath133 .",
    "this quantity is related to the newtonian potential by _ - = - . [ phi- ] we can understand this result by noting that , unlike non - relativistic particles , photons do not couple directly to @xmath8 .",
    "hence the gravitational potential relevant for their motion must be suppressed by a factor of @xmath134 relative to the newtonian potential .",
    "the expression for @xmath133 follows from substituting  ( [ phi- ] ) into  ( [ modpoisson ] ) : _",
    "-(k ) & = & + & & 4g| _ k. the last factor of @xmath135 is what one would use in standard gravity to translate @xmath67 into a lensing potential . here",
    ", however , the two prefactors each act to suppress @xmath133 relative to the density perturbation :    * on scales much larger than the graviton compton wavelength , such that @xmath136 , the first prefactor suppresses @xmath133 . * on highly non - linear scales , such that @xmath66 , we have .    since @xmath137 at late times , the local vainshtein effect therefore results in a 4/3 suppression factor for @xmath138 on these scales .",
    "over the next decade observations of the large scale structure will subject the @xmath0cdm / standard gravity paradigm , thus far remarkably successful at accounting for cosmological data , to increasingly stringent tests of its predictions . in this work",
    "we have studied the possibility that cosmic acceleration instead stems from a breakdown of einstein gravity at cosmological distances , due to the graviton having a small mass .",
    "specifically , we have focused on the normal branch of the dgp model as well as its extension to higher dimensions , called cascading gravity .",
    "the longitudinal mode of the graviton in these models results in stronger gravitational attraction which , thanks to the vainshtein screening effect , only kicks in at late times and on sufficiently large scales .",
    "we have focused exclusively on the  normal \" branch of these theories , which are ghost - free and _ not _ self - accelerating .",
    "( note that the effects uncovered in this work would be exactly the opposite on the self - accelerating branch  the longitudinal mode would mediate a repulsive force , thereby impeding the formation of structure . )",
    "we have presented a simple phenomenological procedure for calculating the development of large scale structure in the standard dgp model and its higher - dimensional , cascading gravity cousins . to focus on the effects of modifications to the growth history , we have assumed a background @xmath0cdm expansion history in all cases .",
    "this should be a good approximation for the actual background in cascading models , where the corrections to the friedmann equation is expected to be a slowly - varying function of @xmath70 .",
    "our n - body simulations confirm the expectation that structure is more evolved in modified gravity than in @xmath0cdm cosmology :    * structure grows faster on large scales , leading to enhanced clustering for fixed primordial normalization . * as a converse , for a power spectrum normalized to the power observed _ today _ , our model predicts systematically less power in the past than would be inferred from a standard @xmath0cdm evolution . *",
    "nonlinear processing reaches longer length scales thanks to enhanced gravitational strength , leading to an additional enhancement in power on nonlinear scales relative to standard gravity .",
    "* nonetheless , freedom to marginalize over galaxy bias allows our modified gravity model to fit the power spectrum derived from the sloan digital sky survey main galaxies .",
    "while our understanding of these simple results are encouraging , they represent only the beginning of our program for testing this class of modifications of gravity .",
    "galaxy power spectra , with their bias uncertainty , are not the most discriminating measurements for constraining or demonstrating the particular effects of these models .",
