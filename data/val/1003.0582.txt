    "possibly the most remarkable incipient property associated to a fermionic gas is its instability to the pairing phenomenon . under an arbitrarily weak attractive force , which can originate in such a simple process as coupling to phonons",
    ", the gas will develop an instability towards the formation of cooper pairs , this process forming the basis of the bcs theory of superconductivity @xcite , with further remarkable consequences such as the meissner and josephson effects .",
    "within bcs theory , single - particle excitations are suppressed by the superconducting gap , which is obtained from the solution of a variational ansatz for the wavefunction defined in the grand - canonical ensemble ( electron number is by construction not conserved anymore ) and in the thermodynamic limit ( since a continuous energy band is assumed ) .    while these mean - field approaches successfully describe the experimental features of the traditional bulk superconductors , recent experiments",
    "have also considered metallic nanograins @xcite in which the level spacing is finite and of the same order as the superconducting gap , and in which some coulomb blockade effects could occur in view of the finite charging energy of the grain .",
    "these studies open the door to many interesting further questions not answerable within bcs theory , and require mesoscopic effects to be encompassed back into the model .",
    "one way to approach this problem is to use the so - called reduced bcs model , defined by the hamiltonian h_bcs=^n _ 2 c^_c _ -g^n_,=1 c^_+c^_- c_-c_+,[bcsh ] which was introduced by richardson in the early 1960 s in the context of nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "the model describes ( pseudo ) spin-@xmath0 fermions ( electrons , nucleons , etc  ) in a shell of doubly degenerate single particle energy levels with energies @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath3 are the fermionic annihilation operators , @xmath4 labels the degenerate time reversed states ( i.e. spin or isospin ) and @xmath5 denotes the effective pairing coupling constant . despite its simplified character ( the interaction couples all levels uniformly ) , the model does have a number of advantages as compared to bcs theory .",
    "first of all , it can be solved within the canonical ensemble ( fixed number of electrons ) , a situation which is relevant for isolated nanograins .",
    "second , and rather remarkably for an exactly solvable model , it remains solvable for an arbitrary choice of parameters , and can thus provide quantitative predictions for various situations obtained by considering various choices of the set of energy levels @xmath6 ( both their number , and their individual value ) , coupling @xmath5 , and filling . besides mesoscopic superconductivity , this model and its solution also find applications in other fields ( see the reviews [ ] for some applications outside of condensed matter physics ) .    the nature of the electronic states in a metallic nanograin can conceivably be probed in a number of different experiments .",
    "electronic transport through such a grain could be studied by attaching either metallic or superconducting leads .",
    "the observable i - v characteristics or josephson currents would be theoretically obtainable from correlation functions within the grain .",
    "such correlations , however , are not easily obtainable from the basic exact solution of the model , which focuses on wavefunctions but does not allow to make direct contact with the dynamics of observables .",
    "the history of the study of correlations in the richardson model is however already rather rich .",
    "richardson himself in 1965 @xcite derived a first exact expression for static correlation functions . in a significant development ,",
    "amico and osterloh @xcite proposed a new method to write down such correlations explicitly but with results limited to system sizes of up to 16 particles .",
    "a major simplification was then proposed by zhou et al .",
    "@xcite : using the algebraic bethe ansatz ( aba ) and the slavnov formula for scalar products of states @xcite , they managed to obtain the static correlation functions as sums over @xmath7 determinants of @xmath8 matrices .",
    "these expressions have been further simplified by us in a previous publication , where they were evaluated numerically for a particular choice of the energy levels @xmath6 @xcite allowing to describe the crossover from mesoscopic to macroscopic physics , going beyond previous results limited to fewer particles @xcite .",
    "we mention that a different approach , valid in the case of highly degenerate @xmath6 , is also available @xcite .    despite all these developments , up to now none of these approaches has been adapted and used to calculate dynamical correlation functions , important to quantify the response of a physical system to any realistic experimental probe . in this paper",
    "we use a method that mixes integrability and numerics and is similar to that used by some of us to study the dynamical correlation functions @xcite and entanglement entropy @xcite in spin - chains , as well as dynamical correlations in bose gases @xcite . in short ,",
    "the abacus method @xcite consists in using the exact knowledge of the form factors of physical observables as determinants of matrices whose entries are the unknown richardson rapidities . for any given state ,",
    "these rapidities are calculated by solving the richardson equations .",
    "the corresponding form factors are then evaluated .",
    "finally we need to sum over all these contributions , but this can be done by searching for the states in the hilbert space that contribute more significantly to the correlation function .",
    "this is done by optimizing properly the scanning of the hilbert space @xcite and the accuracy of the result is kept under control by checking the values of the sum - rules .",
    "however , we will see that for the richardson model , this scanning is particularly easy since the two - particle states dominate the sum even when increasing the number of particles ( in strong contrast with what happens for other models @xcite ) .",
    "this property is clearly connected with the mean - field character of the model in the thermodynamic limit and the subsequent suppression of quantum fluctuations .",
    "however at finite ( sufficiently low ) number of particles the effect of quantum fluctuations can be revealed by small , but maybe measurable , multi - particle channels .",
    "we mention that another variation on the abacus logic has recently been used for the calculation of out - of - equilibrium observables in the pairing model subjected to a quantum quench , but in that case the class of excitations contributing was much wider @xcite .",

    "( [ bcsh ] ) , singly- as well as doubly - occupied levels are allowed .",
    "the interaction however couples only doubly - occupied levels among themselves , and due to the so - called blocking effect @xcite , unpaired particles completely decouple from the dynamics and behave as if they were free .",

    "the first effect makes the energy scale associated to the bcs gap irrelevant since only the first band of excited states is contributing to the correlations .",
    "the vanishing width of this band is then responsible for the ` inverted scaling ' by making the relevant energy differences smaller as @xmath5 increases .",
    "this very peculiar half - filling scaling property makes it possible to slow down specific dynamical processes in this system by making the interaction stronger .",
