    "network coding is a branch of coding theory that arose in 2000 in the work by ahlswede , cai , li and yeung @xcite .",
    "while classical coding theory focuses on point - to - point communication , network coding focuses on multicast communication , i.e. , a source communicating with a set of sinks .",
    "the source transmits messages to the sinks over a network , which is modeled as a directed multigraph .",
    "some examples of multicast communication come from internet protocol applications of streaming media , digital television , and peer - to - peer networking .",
    "the goal in multicast communication is achieving maximal information rate .",
    "informally , this corresponds to maximizing the amount of messages per transmission , i.e. , per single use of the network .",
    "li , cai and yeung in @xcite prove that maximal information rate can be achieved in multicast communication using linear network coding , provided that the size of the base field is large enough .",
    "the algebraic aspect of network coding emerged with the work by ktter and kschischang @xcite .",
    "the authors introduced a new setting for random linear network coding : given the linearity of the combinations , the authors suggest to employ subspaces of a given vector space as codewords .",
    "indeed , subspaces are invariant under taking linear combinations of their elements .",
    "let @xmath6 be the set of all @xmath1-linear subspaces of @xmath7 .",
    "they show that @xmath6 is a metric space , with distance @xmath8 ktter and kschischang define network codes to be subsets of @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , they define constant - dimension codes as subsets , whose elements have all the same dimension . notions of errors and erasures compatible with the new transmission model are introduced in  @xcite .",
    "in addition , upper and lower bounds for the cardinality of network codes are established in  @xcite .",
    "we review here some of the constructions of constant - dimension codes present in the literature . the first one is introduced by ktter and kschischang in  @xcite",
    ". the construction uses evaluation of linearized polynomials over a subspace .",
    "the codes that one obtains are called reed - solomon - like codes , because of the similarities with reed - solomon codes in classical coding theory . due to their connection with the rank - metric codes introduced in  @xcite , these codes are also called lifted rank - metric codes . ktter and",
    "kschischang devise a list-@xmath9 minimum - distance decoding algorithm for their codes",
    ". spread codes , which are the subject of this paper , were first introduced by the authors in  @xcite .",
    "spread codes contain the codes with maximal minimum distance in  @xcite .",
    "another family of network codes , based on @xmath10-analogs of designs , appears in  @xcite . aided by computer search ,",
    "the authors find constant - dimension codes based on designs with big cardinality .",
    "another family of codes is constructed in  @xcite .",
    "the construction builds on that of reed - solomon - like codes , and the codes that the authors obtain contain them .",
    "the construction is also based on binary constant - weight codes , ferrer diagrams , and rank - metric codes .",
    "the proposed decoding algorithm operates on two levels : first one decodes a constant - weight code , then one applies a decoding algorithm for rank - metric codes . in  @xcite",
    "skachek introduces a family of codes , that is a sub - family of the one in  @xcite . in",
    "@xcite the authors introduce another family of codes , which they obtain by evaluating pairs of linearized polynomials .",
    "the codes obtained can be decoded via a list decoding algorithm , which is introduced in the same work .",
    "this work focuses on _ spread codes _ which are a family of constant - dimension codes first introduced in @xcite .",
    "spreads of @xmath7 are a collection of subspaces of @xmath7 , all of the same dimension , which partition the ambient space .",
    "such a family of subspaces of @xmath7 exists if and only if the dimension of the subspaces divides @xmath5 .",
    "the construction of spread codes is based on the @xmath1-algebra @xmath11 $ ] where @xmath12 is the companion matrix of a monic irreducible polynomial of degree @xmath4 .",
    "concretely , we define spread codes as @xmath13\\ \\mbox { for all } i\\in \\{1,\\dots , r\\ } \\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the grassmannian of all subspaces of @xmath7 of dimension @xmath4 .",
    "since spreads partition the ambient space , spread codes are optimal .",
    "more precisely , they have maximum possible minimum distance @xmath15 , and the largest possible number of codewords for a code with minimum distance @xmath15 .",
    "indeed , they achieve the anticode bound from  @xcite .",
    "this family is closely related to the family of reed - solomon - like codes introduced in  @xcite .",
