    "we do not yet fully understand the dynamics and evolution of radio galaxies . classifying sources on the basis of their morphology",
    "has been one useful approach to this question",
    ". such work by fanaroff & riley ( `` fr '' ; @xcite ) has stimulated discussion and simple models of the sources .",
    "fr type ii sources are generally accepted to arise from a collimated , supersonic jet which impacts the ambient medium , resulting in a hot spot at the end of the jet , and leaving behind a cocoon which surrounds the jet .",
    "this model is qualitatively attractive and leads to possible quantitative predictions .",
    "our picture of fr type i sources , however , is much less complete .",
    "it has been suggested that type i s are subsonic , turbulent plumes .",
    "this model does not , however , seem able to account for the range of phenomena seen in the data ; nor has it been developed quantitatively to a point which would allow specific predictions of source evolution .",
    "we find this frustrating , as type i sources are much more common in the universe than type ii s , and show much more diversity .",
    "we present two figures which illustrate how rare classical type ii s are .",
    "first , one of us @xcite has used the lrl , b2 and gb samples @xcite to calculate 1.4 ghz luminosity functions separately for type ii and type i sources , shown in figure 1 .",
    "it is apparent that type i s dominate type ii s below @xmath0w / hz , and strongly dominate in total numbers ( integrated over radio flux ) .",
    "second , only 13 of 197 resolved sources in a new data set are classic ii s .",
    "this data set is the ledlow - owen sample of radio sources in clusters of galaxies ( shown in figure 2 ; @xcite ) .",
    "our work in this paper uses this sample .",
    "what questions would we like to answer regarding the dynamics of radio sources ?",
    "many spring to mind :    * how does a radio source evolve in linear size , volume , morphology ? * how does the luminosity of a radio source evolve with time ? *",
    "how can we explain the observed distribution of sources in the ( size , power ) or ( power , galaxy magnitude ) planes ? * what physical factors determine the morphology of a radio source ?",
    "that is , why does it become type i or type ii in the fr classification ? alternatively , why does it become straight or tailed , the types introduced in this paper ? * does the morphology of a particular source change with time ? does a source change from fr type ii to i , or from straight to tailed ?    in order to address these questions ,",
    "we have undertaken a program of study based on a new data set , the ledlow - owen sample @xcite of radio sources in clusters of galaxies .",
    "we expected that the evolution of a source should be determined by such factors as its jet power , age , parent galaxy size , and the density or pressure of the surrounding medium .",
    "to this end , we gathered radio , optical and x - ray data on the sources in the sample , and have searched for trends which might answer the questions above .    in this process , we found that the ledlow - owen sources fall clearly into two morphological classes .",
    "this was not what we expected .",
    "nearly all of the sources in this sample would be called fr type i , based on their lack of outer hot spots , and their position in the ( power , magnitude ) diagram ( as presented by @xcite ) .",
    "our work with the images made it clear that the sources are not a uniform sample , but rather divide nicely into two groups .",
    "these groups are not well described by the two well - known fr types .",
    "in fact , it now seems that the two fr types might more properly be described as `` classic type ii s '' ( the rare sources with clear outer hot spots ) and `` all other sources '' ( the more common sources , without outer hot spots , and including the diversity of source types we find ) .",
    "we worked with the ledlow - owen cluster sample (  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the sample consists of 219 radio sources above 10 mjy in the inner region of nearby abell clusters ( @xmath1 ) , and a representative sample of 48 sources above 200 mjy in more distant clusters ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "these data were supplemented by images from the rosat all - sky survey for a subset of the nearby sample @xcite .",
    "details of the sample and our analysis of it are given in @xcite .",
    "the data we have measured or compiled are :    * radio power at 1.4 ghz ( @xmath3 ) , @xcite . * radio images , also at 1.4 ghz , taken with the vla @xcite . *",
    "optical magnitude of the parent galaxy , within an isophote at 24.5 mag asec@xmath4 in the r band ( @xmath5 ) ; @xcite . * radio flux sizes ( the radius which includes @xmath6% of the 1.4 ghz flux ) @xcite .",
    "* source offset from the cluster x - ray peak ( central or nearest peak , depending on the cluster ) @xcite .",
    "* characteristic size of the x - ray cluster , measured in terms of the radius which contains 50% of the flux @xcite .",
    "* density of the cluster gas at the radio source position ( using simple deprojections of the x - ray data ) @xcite .",
    "our initial goal was to use these data to address the fundamental questions listed above .",
    "this has not proved overly successful ; indeed , we found very few significant correlations in these quantities .",
    "we do find a slight correlation between radio power and radio size ",
    "higher power sources tend to be larger .",
    "in general , however , statistical studies of the full sample do not shed great light on the problems we set out to study .",
    "however , in this process we did find one very striking pattern .",
    "figure 2 shows the full sample in the @xmath7 plane . as noted above ,",
    "most of the sources fall in the `` type i region '' as defined by @xcite .",
    "thus , we thought when we began that we were studying type i sources .",
    "we found , however , a more complex situation .",
    "nearly all of the resolved sources fall neatly into two morphological classes .",
    "the existence of these two classes does not seem to have been noticed before .",
    "we believe it is a significant clue to understanding the nature , and thus evolution , of radio galaxies in general .",
    "to be specific : 197 of the sources have vla images good enough to estimate the source morphology .",
    "( for the rest , 21 were unresolved , and 48 were marginally resolved but too faint or too small to allow us to determine the morphology ) . of the 197 well - resolved sources , 188 can easily be put into one of our two classes .",
    "our criterion for classification is , _ how far does the jet propagate undisturbed?_. based on this , our two classes are as follows .    *",
    "type a , or straight , sources . * in these sources , the jet retains its identity all the way to the outer end of the source , where it may or may not end in an outer bright spot .",
    "the end of the flow  what might be called a `` working surface ''  is apparent in most of the images ; there is no continuation of the jet flow into an outer tail , as there is in tailed sources .",
    "the inner jet is generally embedded in a lobe or cocoon ( although this may be faint and hard to detect in some of the sources ) .",
    "the jet can be more or less collimated , depending on the source .",
    "these sources as a class are not strongly bent .",
    "the presence , or absence , of an outer hot spot is not critical to this class .",
    "sources with and without external hot spots share all other characteristics .",
    "classical fr type ii sources fall into this category , as do many sources which would be called fr type i. about 1/3 of the sample ( 61/197 ) fall into this category .",
    "thirteen of these have clear outer hot spots which would make them classical fr type ii s .",
    "* type b , or tailed , sources . * in these sources , the jet begins narrow and well - collimated .",
    "it soon undergoes a dramatic transition at an inner hot spot , where the flow becomes broader and brighter .",
    "high resolution images show complex structure within these hot spots .",
    "the flow does not disrupt , however ; it continues on , past the hot spot , into a radio tail . in some sources",
    "the end of the tail is seen , while the surface brightness of other sources fades too fast to allow us to see the end .",
    "this outer flow can sometimes be seen to have a two - part structure : an inner channel embedded in an outer lobe .",
    "sources which have been called wide - angle tail or narrow - angle tail fall into this category .",
    "we note , however , that while these sources are often bent , they need not be .",
    "some tailed sources display the jet - hot spot transition without bending .",
    "about 2/3 of the sample ( 127/197 ) fall into the tailed category ; about 4/5 of these are strongly bent .",
    "figures 3 and 4 illustrate one example of each class ; more are illustrated in @xcite , where we also present our classification of each source in the sample .",
    "we only have radio data at one frequency for this sample , so we can not draw general conclusions about the spectral properties of our two classes . however , other work provides hints .",
    "based on two - frequency spectral maps , parma _ etal _",
    "@xcite find that fr type i sources divide into two spectral types : those in which the spectrum steepens going away from the core , and those in which it flattens .",
    "inspection of the individual sources in their work suggests that their two spectral types correlate with our two morphological types . based on their smaller sample ,",
    "we speculate that our straight sources will turn out to have spectra which flatten going away from the galactic core ( much as the spectra of fr type ii sources do ) .",
    "we further speculate that our tailed sources will turn out to have spectra which steepen going away from the core .",
    "this speculation is also supported by the earlier work of odonoghue _ etal _",
    "@xcite , who found that the radio spectra of wide - angle tail sources steepen going away from the core .",
    "we believe the clear division of the sample into straight and tailed sources is telling us something about the underlying physics of the sources",
    ". we were disappointed , however , to find that simple statistical tests were inconclusive .",
    "we might have expected , for instance , that the sources would divide by radio size ( perhaps one type might be younger , or might evolve into the other ? ) , or would divide by radio power ( a stronger jet might lead to different flow dynamics ? ) .",
    "alternatively , we might have expected the two types of sources to sit in different cluster environments ( perhaps high or low ambient density might lead to different flow dynamics ? ) .",
    "we were surprised to find that such simple ideas were not borne out .",
    "we looked for differences between the two classes in each of the quantities listed above , with little luck . to zeroth order , tailed and straight sources have the same radio power , same radio size , same parent galaxies , and live in the same ranges of x - ray offsets and local gas densities .",
    "thus , we have not been able to determine from our data a simple observational factor , or factors , that relate to a source becoming tailed or straight .",
    "we must go a step further and consider the physics of the jet flow . in the next section",
    "we look to possible physical mechanisms for the two dynamical classes .",
    "our work with radio galaxies in clusters has uncovered a significant point .",
    "two morphological ( and therefore dynamical ) classes of radio galaxy exist .",
    "one class we call straight ( type a ) . in these sources",
    "the jet sits inside a lobe or cocoon , and continues mostly undisturbed all the way from the core to the outer edge of the source .",
    "the other we call tailed ( type b ) . in these the jet flow changes dramatically at an inner hot spot , but the flow continues on well past this point into a tail ( which also sits inside a larger cocoon ) .",
    "we note that our new groupings do not correlate particularly well with fr types i and ii .",
    "all of our tailed sources would be fr type i ; however our straight sources contain both fr types .",
    "what determines whether a source is type a or type b ?",
    "we were rather disappointed to find that two classes do not separate in any of our measured quantities .",
    "they do not depend on jet power ( unless the conversion efficiency from jet to radiated power is quite different for the two types ) .",
    "they do not depend on local density or galaxy mass ( magnitude ) .",
    "they are not a function of the source age ( unless the two types of sources reach the same linear size at very different rates ) .",
    "it follows that several simple arguments fail .",
    "for instance , we can not say that straight sources evolve into tailed ; if that were the case , we would have found that tailed sources are larger than straight .",
    "nor can we argue that something in the environment ( such as ambient pressure or density ) gives rise to the difference ; there is no evidence that the two source types are found in different regions of their clusters .",
    "this leaves us only with the option of an internal variable .",
    "that is , some internal feature of the jet flow must determine whether the source becomes tailed or straight .",
    "we suggest this is a matter of the stability of the flow .",
    "our hypothesis is as follows ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .    * * all young sources * must start out with a `` straight '' configuration .",
    "that is , they begin with a jet propagating out into the local ambient medium , and depositing material into a slower - moving cocoon which surrounds the jet .",
    "the young source will develop according to the usual arguments based on momentum and energy conservation ( for instance in @xcite , @xcite ) . at some point in this evolution ,",
    "internal factors decide whether the source becomes straight or tailed . * * straight sources * result when the jet remains essentially stable . in these sources",
    ", the jet has not undergone dramatic disruptions .",
    "rather , it continues to propagate more or less undisturbed all the way to the end of the source , reaching current lengths of several tens of kpc to a few hundred kpc . at the end of the source ,",
    "the jet impacts the ambient medium , slows down and deposits material in a larger cocoon .",
    "the lack of bent sources in this category requires that the undisurbed jet remain rigid , and thus not susceptible to deflection by external forces .",
    "if the jet remains highly supersonic , an outer shock ( hot spot ) will form .",
    "if it is only subsonic or transonic , the outer jump will be smaller and not necessarily radio bright . thus , classic fr type ii sources may develop in this type of source , but need not do so . *",
    "* tailed sources * result when the jet undergoes a strong instability .",
    "the instability develops when the jet reaches a few tens of kpc from the galactic nucleus .",
    "the location of the instability is apparent in images of these sources , where the jet enters the inner hot spots and broader tails .",
    "when such an instability sets in and grows to large amplitude , it distorts and disrupts the flow .",
    "this results in side - to - side `` flapping '' of the ordered jet flow which can be seen in good images .",
    "in addition , the instability appears to saturate at some large amplitude .",
    "the flow is not totally disrupted , but is able to continue on to form a ( quasi - stable ) tail .",
    "the images show that such radio tails are often embedded in outer envelopes , which we suspect act as `` cocoons '' for these flows .",
    "when tailed sources are strongly bent , the bends occur at the hot spots : the change in flow properties there seems to make the flow more susceptible to deflection .      what governs the instability ?",
    "we consider the kelvin - helmholtz instability as a concrete example .",
    "this may very well be the most important instability in jet dynamics ; considering it as an example allows us to take advantage of substantial work available in the literature .",
    "based on the work of hardee and his colleagues ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) , three factors are critical to the jet s stability :    * * the jet magnetic field*. a strong parallel field ( compared to the jet s kinetic energy ) will stabilize the flow .",
    "the alfven mach number ( ratio of flow speed to alfven speed ) is critical here . as a general statement",
    ", we can say that subalfvenic flow is stable , while superalfvenic is not .",
    "this is modified by the jet density : a jet denser than its surroundings will remain stable to a somewhat higher alfven mach number .",
    "this is also extended by the field structure : a strong helical field will be more effective at stablizing than a fully parallel field . * * the jet density*. jets which are heavy relative to their surroundings are more stable .",
    "this helps in two ways .",
    "( 1 ) a heavy jet can remain stable even if somewhat superalfvenic .",
    "( 2 ) potentially disruptive perturbations on a linearly unstable jet will grow more slowly if the jet is heavy .",
    "we emphasize that it is the _ cocoon _ density , not the ambient density , which is relevant here . * * the jet speed*. instabilities in fast jets disrupt the flow more slowly .",
    "the distance over which an instability grows to important levels , after it sets in , is proportional to the jet lorentz factor and to the jet magnetosonic mach number ( defined as the ratio of jet speed to magnetosonic wave speed ) .",
    "a change in any one of these quantities can change a jet flow from being nearly stable to being dramatically unstable .",
    "for instance , it may be that straight sources result from more strongly magnetized jets , and tailed sources from jets with weaker fields . or",
    ", it may be that straight sources result from faster ( or more relativistic ) jets , while tailed sources are produced by slower ( or subrelativistic ) jets . or",
    ", it may be that straight sources result when the cocoon is underdense relative to the jet , and tailed sources when the ( young ) cocoon is overdense .",
    "we have not yet identified which of these possibilities is the crucial one ; it may be that all three contribute to the dynamics of real radio sources .",
    "how does this new picture impact arguments about source evolution and global dynamics ?",
    "in particular , how do we address the questions raised in  1 ? the large - scale evolution of both type a and type b sources must be governed by the outflow , following models originally developed for fr type ii sources .",
    "the linear size evolution will be determined by the jet thrust ( balanced against the density of the ambient medium ) .",
    "the energy described by the jet power will be partly deposited in the cocoon ( the rest going to expansion work and radiative losses ) .",
    "such models should be relevant to both classes of sources we find , but must differ in application to the two classes . for straight sources ,",
    "the thrust and power are those of the jet as it emerges from the galactic core ( perhaps on a kpc scale ) . for tailed sources ,",
    "the thrust and power are those of the tail , established after the flow has reorganized itself at the inner hot spots",
    ".    finally , what can be said about the radio power ? predicting the evolution of radio power remains , as always , one of the hardest questions .",
    "we must remember that radio emission is a sensitive , nonlinear , variable - gain tracer of the flow dynamics .",
    "synchrotron emission depends on a complex convolution of the magnetic field strength and structure with the relativistic particle distribution in space and in energy .",
    "we remain cautious about connecting dynamical models to emission models in any simple way .",
