    "the development of tidal tails during galaxy encounters is predominantly a gravitational effect ; as a result , both gas and stars should have similar kinematics and spatial morphology on large scales .",
    "however , in a significant number of systems the hi and stellar tidal debris do in fact show marked spatial offsets , including the tidal tails of ngc 520 ( hibbard , vacca , & yun 2000 ) , 7714/5 ( smith etal 1997 ) , and , most dramatically , ngc 3690 ( hibbard etal 2000 ) . at face value , these observations suggest that hydrodynamic forces may also play a role in the global evolution of the tidal tails , via effects such as an interaction between the tidal gas and a hot gaseous halo or starburst wind ( hibbard etal 2000 ) . here",
    "i show that the offsets arise naturally from the differing radial distributions of gas and stars , coupled with interaction - driven dissipation and inflow in the tidal gas .",
    "no hot gas component is needed to explain these offsets .",
    "previous dynamical modeling of merging galaxies ( e.g. , barnes & hernquist 1991 , 1996 ; mihos & hernquist 1996 ) showed no evidence for segregation of gas and stars in tidal debris .",
    "however , in those models , both the gas and stars had identical exponential spatial distributions , whereas the gas distribution in disk galaxies is typically much more spatially extended than the starlight .",
    "i have rerun the fiducial merger model of mh96 , using an gas distribution which is exponential within @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is the stellar disk scale length ) , then falls as @xmath2 until a truncation radius of @xmath3 .",
    "figure 1 shows the model just prior to the final merging , and a prominent gas / star offset can be seen in the prograde tail .",
    "the fact that we see an offset at all argues that these offsets need not be the result of an interaction between the tail gas and a hot gas component , since no such hot gas component is present in our model .",
    "is the offset due solely to the differing initial spatial distribution of the gas and stars ?",
    "a simulation was run identical to the first , but with the gas particles evolved collisionlessly . in this case , no gas / star offset developed , indicating that hydrodynamic forces are at work in shaping the tails . by analyzing a subset of tail particles in the full hydrodynamical model",
    ", we find that both the gas and star particles seen in the tail are following a largely collisionless evolution on large scales .",
    "the gas in the tail comes from larger initial radius than the stars ; its systematically larger angular momentum , results in a leading gas tail .",
    "so what happened to the gas that would have been cospatial with the stars ?    to answer this question , we followed the evolution of with gas particles that came from the same region of initial ( i.e. , pre - encounter ) phase space as the stars which ended up in the tidal tail .",
    "because of the exponential distribution of stars , these gaseous `` phase space partners '' come from small radius in the disk and are more subject to collisional dissipation and inflow during the encounter . as a result ,",
    "this gas decouples from the collisionless evolution that the stars follow , flowing inwards and leaving the stellar tail gas - poor .",
    "in essence , it is not the hydrodynamic evolution of the gas _ observed _ in the tail which leads to the offset , but rather the hydrodynamic decoupling and inflow of the low angular momentum gas which would have otherwise filled in the stellar tail ."
