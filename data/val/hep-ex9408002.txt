    "midway through the run , the t , v hodoscope was removed and a more sophisticated second level trigger installed .",

    "events with substantial activity in the upstream part of the ba , but minimal energy in the last third of the ba , were vetoed .",
    "the comparison of the signals in the up- and downstream sections allowed us to reject events with lost photons without vetoing good events with accidental activity associated with the interaction of a beam hadron in the ba .",

    "in addition to the @xmath157 and @xmath161 triggers , several special purpose triggers were collected at the same time .",

    "the telescope was roughly 50  m from the target ; the line from the target through the telescope passed approximately ten meters west of the spectrometer . as a result ,",
    "the accidental trigger rate was proportional to the instantaneous beam intensity , but was otherwise independent of the presence or absence of activity in the spectrometer .",
    "pedestal triggers were used to record the zero - signal behavior of all adc s ; calibration flasher triggers were used to monitor the behavior of the lead glass calorimeter .",

    "the difference in upstream and downstream @xmath164-view track slopes , combined with knowledge of the analyzing magnet s field integral , provided us with sufficient information to calculate a particle s momentum .",
    "since the paired sense planes in the drift chambers were staggered by a half - cell , the sum of the measured drift distances in one view of a chamber should equal the 6.35  mm separation between adjacent sense wires .",

    "( [ rhocoher ] ) and ( [ rhodiff2 ] ) , we find @xmath363 for a two interaction length regenerator , @xmath364 , and the destructive interference will be nearly perfect .",

    "the nonzero @xmath26-@xmath3 mass difference makes the @xmath3 amplitude s phase lag behind the @xmath26 phase as the kaon travels through the regenerator : the @xmath3 amplitude from elastic scatters at the upstream and downstream ends of the regenerator will contribute with slightly different phases to the decay amplitudes .",
    "this phase drift is negligible at fermilab energies , where it is @xmath365 per meter of flight path for a 100 gev kaon .",
    "in addition , the finite @xmath3 lifetime plays a role .",
    "the contribution to the @xmath3 amplitude from coherent forward scattering will decay in flight as the kaon moves through the regenerator .",
    "the fraction which survives is a function of the regenerator length and the kaon s lifetime , and is independent of the location of the elastic scatter .",
    "the diffractive contribution to the @xmath3 amplitude , created at the scattering site , will also decay in flight . as a result",
    ", the surviving diffractive contribution depends on the distance from the scattering site to the downstream end of the regenerator .",
    "consequently , the sum of the coherent and diffractive @xmath3 amplitudes will vary slightly with the location of the scattering site .",
