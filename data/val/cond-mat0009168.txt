    "binary fluids quenched below the demixing temperature exhibit an interesting off - equilibrium phenomenology that is nowadays reasonably well understood @xcite .",
    "tipically , after an early stage when domains of the two phases are formed , the kinetics proceeds by coarsening of these structures maintaining their morphology invariant . for viscous fluids , such as some polymer blends ,",
    "hydrodynamic effects can be neglected in a preasymptotic time domain and a description of the dynamics in terms of diffusive processes alone is appropriate .",
    "this is the situation we focus on in this paper . in this case",
    ", the typical domains size @xmath3 grows according to the lifshitz - slyozov law @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this whole phenomenology is known to be correctly described in terms of the time dependent ginzburg - landau model @xcite .",
    "this continuum approach , beside being often more efficient for numerical investigations , is better suited for analytical purposes . in fact , despite an exact solution is presently lacking , successful approximate theories have been developed . among these a prominent role is played by the large @xmath2 expansion .",
    "indeed , when the model is generalized to a vectorial order parameter with an arbitrary number @xmath2 of components , the limit @xmath5 turns out to be analytically tractable and perturbation theories around it can be applied .",
    "this special limit has proven to provide qualitatively correct informations about the kinetic evolution contributing , in some cases , to clarify the nature of the process @xcite .",
    "when segregating systems are driven mechanically , by applying an external field or making the liquid flow , the comprehension we have of the kinetics is much poorer .",
    "this is at odd with the wide technological interest of these systems in many application areas @xcite . in the case of an applied shear flow considered here ,",
    "it is known that the evolution is profoundly changed with respect to that of a static liquid @xcite .",
    "the most noticeable effect is the alignment of the domains of the two species along the flow direction , chosen in the following as the @xmath6 axis .",
    "this produces an anisotropy in the system and , in principle , one has to consider the typical domains sizes @xmath7 and @xmath8 along the coordinate axis separately .",
    "modified growth exponents for @xmath7 and @xmath8 with respect to the case of an immobile fluid are expected and a difference @xmath9 between the power - law exponents of @xmath10 and @xmath11 has been reported @xcite . in experiments , depending on the system considered ,",
    "it has also been observed that , after an initial growth , the shear can stabilize the system into a stationary state characterized by a very large @xmath10 with @xmath11 finite , namely the phase separation process is interrupted @xcite .",
    "stretching of domains requires work against surface tension .",
    "macroscopically the viscoelastic response of the fluid shows up through a non - vanishing stress tensor @xcite . on microscopic scales",
    "it has been recognized @xcite that the strain exerted by the fluid can produce different effects and in particular the breakup and the recombination of domains .",
    "the fragmentation process is accompanied by the formation of small bubbles and more isotropic clusters .",
    "then these structures , which grow by diffusion and join each other favoured by the flow , are successively stretched again and broken in a cyclical way . in an extended system , with many such domains , if the break - up events occur incoherently along the fluid we do not expect any appreciable effect , apart possibly from a global slowing of the growth process . differently , if the break - up of the domains with the successive more isotropic growth is a coherent process in the network occurring when the stress exceeds a sort of threshold reached syncronously in all the system , one could expect a periodicity superimposed on the net behavior of the typical domains size and of other observables .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we have shown that a pattern similar to the latter case outlined above is indeed exhibited by the large-@xmath2 model : physical observables such as the domains radii or the rheological indicators behave for long times as power - laws decorated by log - time periodic oscillations . in that framework it was possible to identify this oscillatory pattern with a corresponding behavior of the four peaks observed in the structure factor . moreover in the large-@xmath2 limit it was possible to show the existence of a dynamical scaling regime even in the presence of shear with the difference between the power law growth exponents in the flow and in the transverse directions equal to 1 .",
    "this last observation was confirmed by a successive exact asymptotic solution of the large-@xmath2 model @xcite . in the @xmath12 limit ,",
    "the only accessible in this solution , however , the periodic oscillations do not survive",
    ". then it must believed that these are long lasting preasymptotic effects . in experiments , on the other hand ,",
    "a four peaked structure factor has been occasionally reported @xcite while the so called double overshoot of the excess viscosity observed sometimes @xcite can be interpreted as being due to the oscillations of this quantity .    given this scenario the question of the accuracy of the large-@xmath2 limit for the description of real systems , where @xmath13 , must be addressed .",
    "in fact , the absence of topological defects for @xmath14 makes concepts like domains or interfaces inappropriate and the reliability of the approximation , even qualitatively , is not for granted . concerning this issue important topics to be addressed are , in our opinion , i ) the existence of the oscillatory pattern together with its counterpart of a four - fold peaked structure factor and ii ) the existence of a scaling regime with specific growth exponents .",
    "this we do in this paper by a complete numerical investigation of the time dependent ginzburg - landau model for sheared binary fluids .",
    "a preliminary account of our results at @xmath15 in @xmath0 was already published in a previous letter @xcite . there",
    "the existence of structure factors with four peaks was confirmed and interpreted in terms of domains distributed in the system with two typical thicknesses .",
    "here we overview and detail further these results .",
    "moreover we study the effects of thermal fluctuations and the role of spatial dimensionality by comparing results for two and three dimensional systems .",
    "regarding issue i ) our results are confirmative of the large-@xmath2 prevision : four peaks of the structure factor are resolved and an initial oscillation of the typical domains radii and other quantities is observed .",
    "domains with different thickness and structure factors with four peaks are observed also in quenching at finite temperatures and in three - dimensional systems .",
    "with respect to point ii ) despite @xmath10 keeps growing , cpu limitations do not allow a determination of the the behavior of @xmath11 and @xmath8 on sufficiently long timescales to detect a possible power - law behavior and the actual value of the exponents .",
    "our data only provide a rough semi - quantitative agreement with the expected scaling laws which , therefore , can not be inferred presently from numerical simulations alone .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "( [ mod ] ) we introduce the time dependent ginzburg - landau model used in the simulations . in sec .",
    "( [ d2 ] ) and  ( [ d3 ] ) we present the results of the numerical simulations in @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "finally we summarize , discuss some open problem and draw our conclusions .",
    "we consider the ginzburg - landau free - energy @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the order parameter representing the concentration difference between the two components .",
    "the polynomial terms in the free - energy density have a single - well structure when @xmath18 , @xmath19 and describe the disordered state of the mixture with @xmath20 . in the ordered state , for @xmath21 , @xmath19 , two symmetric minima are located at @xmath22 .",
    "these are the equilibrium values of the order parameter in the small temperature limit .",
    "the gradient - squared term in ( [ eqn1 ] ) with @xmath23 takes into account the energy cost of interfaces between domains of different composition .",
    "the kinetics is described by the convection - diffusion equation @xmath24 where the order parameter is coupled to an external velocity field @xmath25 . here @xmath26 is a mobility coefficient and @xmath25 will be assumed to be a plane shear flow profile , namely @xmath27 @xmath28 and @xmath29 being a spatially uniform shear rate @xcite , and a unit vector in the @xmath6 direction , respectively .",
    "the thermal noise @xmath30 , which describes thermal fluctuations @xcite , has zero mean and satisfies the fluctuation - dissipation relationship @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the temperature of the fluid and @xmath33 denotes the ensemble average .",
    "the validity of the present approach is restricted to systems where hydrodynamic effects can be neglected . for weakly sheared polymer blends with large polymerization index and similar mechanical properties of the two species ,",
    "however , the present model is expected to be satisfactory in a preasymptotic time domain when velocity fluctuations are small @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eqn2 ] ) can be cast in a dimensionless form after a redefinition of time , space and field scales @xcite .",
    "then we have chosen @xmath34 .",
    "the main observable for the study of the growth kinetics is the structure factor @xmath35 , namely the fourier transform of the real - space equal time correlation function . from the knowledge of the structure factor one",
    "computes the average size of domains in the different directions .",
    "these quantities can be defined as @xmath36 and analogously for the other directions . of experimental interest",
    "are also the rheological indicators , among which the excess viscosity defined as @xcite @xmath37    we have simulated equation ( [ eqn2 ] ) in @xmath0 and @xmath1 by a first - order euler discretization scheme .",
    "periodic boundary conditions have been implemented in the @xmath6 and @xmath38 directions ( for the @xmath1 case ) ; lees - edwards boundary conditions @xcite were used in the @xmath39 direction .",
    "these boundary conditions , originally developed for molecular dynamic simulation of fluids in shear , require the identification of a point at @xmath40 with the one located at @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the size of the lattice ( the same in all the directions ) and @xmath43 is the time discretization interval .",
    "the system was initialized in a high temperature disordered state and the evolution was studied with @xmath44 .",
    "simulations were run using lattices of size @xmath45 in @xmath0 and @xmath46 in @xmath1 with @xmath47 .",
    "the width of interfaces is given by @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "we do not observe significative differences between these two choices of @xmath49 .",
    "the results here shown were obtained with @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "the two dimensional system has been studied considering temperatures in the range @xmath54 , while only the @xmath15 case has been studied in @xmath1 .",
    "in this section we discuss the results of the numerical simulations of eq .",
    "( [ eqn2 ] ) without the thermal noise @xmath30 .",
    "a sequence of configurations of the order parameter are shown in fig .",
    "( [ t0_1 ] ) at different values of the strain @xmath55 . after the usual early stage , when domains are forming from the mixed initial state , a bicontinuous structure is observed .",
    "the distortions produced by the flow appear evident from @xmath56 onwards . at @xmath57",
    "striped domains aligned with a tilt angle @xmath58 with respect to the flow are observed .",
    "as time elapses @xmath58 decreases and the structures align with the flow . in the meanwhile nonuniformities",
    "are formed in the system : regions with domains of different thickness can be clearly observed .",
    "small bubbles are also present , originated from the fragmentation of strained domains",
    ".    a more accurate analysis of the spatial properties can be achieved by means of the structure factor , shown in fig .",
    "( [ t0_2 ] ) .",
    "initially @xmath59 exhibits an almost circular shape , corresponding to the early stage .",
    "then the presence of shear deforms @xmath59 into an ellipse and modifies the profile of the edge until , for @xmath60 , four peaks can be clearly observed .",
    "the presence of a peak in the structure factor is generally interpreted as the signature of a characteristic length in the fluid . here , due to the anisotropy , for each peak one associates one length for each spatial dimension .",
    "since the peaks are related by the symmetry @xmath61 one concludes that there are two distinct characteristic lengths for each space direction .",
    "this corresponds to the observation of thinner and thicker domains in fig .",
    "( [ t0_1 ] ) .",
    "the relative height of the peaks in one of the two specular foils in which @xmath59 results to be separated starting from @xmath62 , is better seen in fig .",
    "( [ t0_3 ] ) . for a better view of @xmath59",
    "we have enlarged differently the scales on the @xmath63 and @xmath64 axes .",
    "here one observes that the two peaks dominate alternatively at the times @xmath57 and @xmath65 .",
    "in a situation like that at @xmath57 , the peak with the larger @xmath64 dominates , indicating that the stretched thin domains are more abundant .",
    "when the strain is further increased their rupture makes the contribution of the thick regions more important ; this causes the other peak of @xmath59 to dominate .",
    "this mechanism is very reminiscent of what happens in the large-@xmath2 model , where the recurrent prevalence of the peaks is shown to reproduce periodically in time up to much longer times then those reachable in the simulations here presented .",
    "the mechanism of stretching and break - up which characterizes the domains evolution produces an oscillatory pattern in the typical size of ordered regions @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this is shown in the first picture of fig .",
    "( [ t0_4 ] ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath11 reaches a local maximum when @xmath59 is of the form of fig .",
    "( [ t0_3 ] ) at @xmath65 .",
    "as already observed thick domains are more abundant at this time , as one can see in fig .",
    "( [ t0_1 ] ) at @xmath65 . in the large-@xmath2 model",
    "this oscillatory behavior is periodic in the logarithm of time and is superimposed on an average power - law increase of the length @xmath66 . here",
    "cpu limitations prevent a clear check of both these predictions .",
    "this behavior reflects itself on most physical observables , among which the excess viscosity . this is shown in the first picture of the panel of fig .",
    "( [ t0_5 ] ) where @xmath67 is plotted against the shear strain @xmath55 .",
    "starting from zero in correspondence of the isotropic initial condition , @xmath68 shows a net increase up to a global maximum at @xmath69 .",
    "this is because the stretching of the domains caused by the shear require work against surface tension .",
    "this increase , however , is not monotonous and @xmath68 shows an oscillating pattern with a first pronounced local maximum at @xmath70 . for larger times @xmath67 decreases due to the ordering process in the fluid .",
    "( [ t0_5 ] ) suggests that oscillations decorates the behavior of the excess viscosity even in this regime .",
    "another oscillation is completed at @xmath71 .",
    "this is further supported by the analogous feature in the large-@xmath2 model .",
    "we mention that a double overshoot of @xmath68 is observed in experiments too @xcite .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations of eq .",
    "( [ eqn2 ] ) for several temperatures in the range @xmath72 . generally speaking we observe a similar qualitative behavior as in the zero temperature case . in particular from the analysis of the field configurations presented in fig .",
    "( [ tf_1 ] ) for @xmath73 one again observes the anisotropic deformation of the bicontinuous pattern emerging after the linear regime and the inhomogeneities in the domains thickness .",
    "thermal fluctuations are responsible for the increased roughness of the interfaces with respect to @xmath15 and for the thermal excitations inside the ordered domains , similarly to the case without shear .    the structure factor , shown in fig .  ( [ tf_2 ] ) , starting from @xmath74 exhibits four peaks whose relative heights prevail recurrently .",
    "however , the difference of the heights of the peaks on the same foil is less than in the case @xmath15 . at @xmath75 instead",
    ", one has only two broad maxima along the diagonal @xmath76 that is splitted into four peaks only at later times .",
    "the same behavior is also observed at @xmath15 but for earlier times .",
    "this suggests that thermal fluctuations slow the evolution of @xmath59 .",
    "quantitative differences with the case @xmath15 , possibly related to the temperature - induced slower evolution , are exhibited by the characteristic sizes of the domains in the @xmath6 and @xmath39 directions .",
    "these quantities are compared for several temperatures in fig .",
    "( [ t0_4 ] ) . on the basis of renormalization group @xcite or scaling arguments @xcite @xmath11 and",
    "@xmath10 are expected to obey an asymptotic power law growth @xmath77 with @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the exponent @xmath80 is the same as without shear and is therefore presumably caused by the evaporation - condensation mechanism responsible for growth in the absence of flow . on the other hand the growth law in the flow direction",
    "is induced by the shear .",
    "an accurate determination of these exponents is not possible on the basis of our numerical simulations .",
    "finite - size effects become quite soon relevant in the phase separation process .",
    "moreover the possible power - law behaviors are decorated by oscillations and it would be necessary to access much longer times in order to average over this periodic contribution . due to finite size effects this , in turn , would require even larger lattices , which is too numerically demanding for standard workstations . despite these limitations , by looking at fig .",
    "( [ t0_4 ] ) one can still make some qualitative observation . at @xmath15",
    "one observes for @xmath81 a regime roughly consistent with @xmath82 even if @xmath83 is smaller then the expected value @xmath84 and @xmath80 is not even well defined because of large oscillations . by raising the temperature one sees that this regime is gradually changed and the effective exponent @xmath83 is lowered until , at @xmath73 , it becomes comparable to the value @xmath85 observed without shear .",
    "if one believes that the asymptotic exponents are not changed by the strength of thermal fluctuations , as suggested by the renormalization group argument @xcite above mentioned and by the analogy with the case @xmath86 , then the role of the temperature is that of producing a preasymptotic behavior characterized by a slower growth in the direction of the flow .    in binary mixtures without shear the temperature",
    "is known to help the segregation process increasing the value of the amplitude in the expression of @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "here , as an effect of the increased temperature , the contribution to the phase separation of the usual evaporation - condensation mechanism , associated to the power exponent @xmath85 , becomes more relevant than the effects of the shear induced mechanism .",
    "this results in the observed preasymptotic behaviour @xmath88 . at later times , even if not observed in our simulations , we expect a growth with a larger exponent close to 4/3 .    the above trend is reflected in the behavior of the excess viscosity shown in fig.([t0_5 ] ) .",
    "if scaling is obeyed asymptotically , so that @xmath89 , then , from eq .  ( [ eqn5bb ] ) one would expect @xmath67 to scale as the inverse domain volume , namely @xmath90 .",
    "hence , given the above discussed behavior of @xmath66 as the temperature is changed , one expects @xmath68 to gradually cross - over from a power law @xmath91 at low temperatures to @xmath92 at higher temperatures , which is rougly consistent with our data .",
    "finally we make some observations about the influence of the temperature on the oscillating behavior .",
    "the role of the oscillations is progressively suppressed increasing @xmath32 .",
    "this is observed in fig .",
    "( [ t0_5 ] ) .",
    "the most apparent effect is the disapparence for @xmath93 of the initial double overshoot of @xmath68",
    ". a gradual suppression of oscillations due to thermal fluctuations is also observed in the plot of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , fig .",
    "( [ t0_4 ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the above discussion about the effects of raising the temperature .",
    "in this section we present the results of numerical simulations of the zero temperature quench process in a three dimensional system .",
    "the typical structures produced in the coarsening process are shown in fig .",
    "( [ 3d_1 ] ) .",
    "domains appear with an interconnected cylindrical shape aligned with a tilt angle @xmath58 that shrinks in time with the flow direction .",
    "contour plots of the structure factor along the coordinate planes are presented in fig .",
    "( [ 3d_2 ] ) . on the plane",
    "@xmath94 the shear term drops out from eq .",
    "( [ eqn2 ] ) as it can be easily checked by transforming eq .",
    "( [ eqn2 ] ) into reciprocal space .",
    "then shear is ineffective along this direction and the structure factor displays the usual circular form as for a static fluid . in the plane @xmath95 @xmath59",
    "has an elliptical form with axes along @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the white spots reveal that four peaks with the same height are present . in the plane",
    "@xmath96 a behaviour reminiscent of the two - dimensional case is observed .",
    "these results can be compared and better describe the experimental measures of the structure factor of @xcite . as in @xmath0 ,",
    "the periodic modulation of the relative heights of the different peaks produces an oscillatory behavior of most observables , as shown in fig .",
    "( [ 3d_3 ] ) for the characteristic sizes @xmath97 and in fig .",
    "( [ 3d_4 ] ) for the excess viscosity @xmath68 . while the oscillations in the @xmath6 and @xmath39 directions are out of phase , due to the recurrent prevalence of thin and thick domains described in the two - dimensional system , it is interesting to note that @xmath8 has a different phase with respect to @xmath11 , indicating an even reacher behavior .",
    "these results provide at least an indication of a power - law increase of @xmath10 and @xmath8 , apart from the oscillations , with an exponent larger than 1.2 for @xmath10 . in the @xmath39 direction , however , there is not even any evidence of growth .",
    "in this article we have considered the phase separation process of a fluid binary mixture in the presence of an applied plane shear flow .",
    "the binary mixture is described by a continuum free - energy functional and we have studied numerically the corresponding time - dependent ginzburg - landau equation with a convective term introduced by the flow .",
    "results have been presented for two - dimensional systems quenched to different final temperatures and for three - dimensional fluids quenched to @xmath15 .",
    "simulations were carried out on lattices larger than those usually considered in phase separation studies in order to get the highest possible resolution for the structure factor .    in real binary fluids the existence of a four - peaked structure factor has been reported @xcite together with a _",
    "double overshoot _ of the excess viscosity . to our knowledge , however , a coherent picture indicating a possible connection between these apparently different phenomena with a clear physical interpretation of their origin was not available .",
    "the results of this paper strongly suggest that the interplay between the four peaks of the structure factor , with their recurrent prevalence , gives rise to an oscillatory phenomenon which reflects itself on the main observables . on these bases",
    "we conjecture that the _",
    "double overshoot _ observed in experiment can be interpreted as the first part of an oscillatory pattern superimposed on the global trend of the excess viscosity and that other local maxima of this quantity could be observed in an experiment on longer time scales .",
    "our simulations suggest that the physical origin of the oscillating behavior is related to the presence of two kind of domains , characterized by different sizes",
    ". the kinetics proceeds by stretching the thicker and breaking the thinner ones , so that a cyclical prevalence of one of the two types occurs .",
    "this is reflected on the properties of the structure factor and other quantities .",
    "these results agree at a semi - quantitative level with the pattern observed in the large-@xmath2 approximation @xcite , indicating that the global picture put forward by the @xmath98 theory is reliable , despite the different physical character of the large-@xmath2 system without stable topological defects .",
    "this predictiveness can be used to infer that the observed oscillations are periodic in the logarithm of time , and that the phase separation proceeds via dynamical scaling , so that the characteristic sizes of the domains grow according to power - laws whose expected exponents have been computed in @xcite .",
    "however these conjectures could not be clearly addressed by our simulations with the available cpu resources , because much larger system should be considered on much longer times .",
