    "the critical behavior of ising models with long - range interactions has attracted much attention during the last three decades .",
    "for the one - dimensional case , some analytical results have been obtained,@xcite as well as a number of numerical results .",
    "the numerical results apply to both inverse - square interactions@xcite and general algebraically decaying interactions.@xcite special mention deserves the work by anderson , yuval , and hamann,@xcite which greatly stimulated the interest in spin chains with long - range interactions .",
    "they also developed a renormalization - like approach to the one - dimensional inverse - square model.@xcite further renormalization - group studies of this particular case are presented in refs .  .",
    "a major contribution was made by fisher , ma , and nickel@xcite and sak,@xcite who obtained renormalization predictions for the critical exponents of models of general dimensionality @xmath0 with algebraically decaying interactions ( obtained independently by suzuki _",
    "et al_.@xcite ) .",
    "other works concerning @xmath1 are two conjectures on , respectively , the boundary between long - range and short - range behavior and the boundary between classical ( mean - field ) and nonclassical behavior , both by stell,@xcite a ( refuted ) conjecture by griffiths,@xcite a rigorous confirmation of the upper critical dimension by aizenman and fernndez ,  @xcite and a variational approach to the ising model with long - range interactions.@xcite furthermore , monte carlo simulations have been carried out for one particular choice of the spin ",
    "spin interaction in a two - dimensional model .",
    "@xcite however , to our knowledge , neither any further verifications of the renormalization predictions nor any other results are available for higher - dimensional ( @xmath1 ) models . to conclude this summary , we mention that the one - dimensional @xmath2-state potts model with long - range interactions has been studied analytically,@xcite numerically,@xcite and in a mean - field approximation on the bethe lattice.@xcite    why are these models interesting ? in the first place from a fundamental point of view : they enable us to study the influence of the interaction range on the critical behavior . e.g. , in one - dimensional systems long - range order is only possible in the presence of spin  spin interactions which decay sufficiently slowly . in the borderline ( inverse - square ) case ,",
    "the 1d model displays a remarkable behavior : at the critical temperature the order parameter exhibits a finite jump ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : rigorous ] ) , but the free energy has an essential singularity such that all thermal properties are smooth . in this sense , the phase transition can be regarded as the one - dimensional analog of a kosterlitz ",
    "thouless transition,@xcite although the jump in the magnetization is not present there , as follows from the mermin ",
    "wagner theorem .",
    "@xcite just as @xmath3 is the lower critical dimension for the two - dimensional @xmath4 model with short - range interactions , @xmath5 is a critical decay rate in a one - dimensional system with interactions decaying as @xmath6 , see ref .  .",
    "with respect to higher - dimensional systems , we note that the decay rate of van  der  waals forces in realistic three - dimensional systems is only slightly faster than at the boundary between short - range ( ising - like ) and long - range critical behavior",
    ". the question of criticality in ionic systems , where the ( screened ) coulomb interactions might lead to effectively algebraically decaying interactions , appears still open to debate.@xcite it has also been claimed that exponents in the long - range universality class have been observed experimentally in a ferromagnetic phase transition.@xcite recently , it has been derived that critical fluctuations may give rise to long - range casimir forces ( decaying much more slowly than van  der  waals interactions ) between uncharged particles immersed in a critical fluid.@xcite furthermore , it was shown by anderson and yuval@xcite that the kondo problem corresponds to a one - dimensional ising model with a combination of inverse - square and nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "yet another application follows from ref .",
    ", where it was shown that random exchange ( lvy - flight ) processes can generate effective interactions which decay algebraically .",
    "hence , the universal critical properties of the nonequilibrium steady state of these systems are those of the long - range equilibrium ising models studied in this paper . finally , the realization that the upper critical dimension can be varied by tuning the decay rate of the interaction led to a special application of these models in ref .  .",
    "here , they were used to analyze a long - standing controversy on the universality of the renormalized coupling constant above the upper critical dimension .    in this article",
    ", we present accurate numerical results for ising systems with algebraically decaying interactions in one , two , and three dimensions . until now",
    ", the long - range character of the spin  spin interactions has been the main bottleneck for the examination of these systems by means of numerical methods ( and , in fact , also for their analytical solution ) .",
    "all previously published numerical results therefore rely on various extrapolations based on data for small systems .",
    "however , the advent of a novel monte carlo algorithm@xcite for the first time enabled us to efficiently simulate these systems .",
    "the high accuracy of the results opens several perspectives : i ) verification of the renormalization predictions for the critical exponents ; ii ) accurate observation of logarithmic corrections at the upper critical dimension ; iii ) first estimates of the critical temperatures of two- and three - dimensional systems with long - range interactions ; iv ) verification of previously obtained estimates of the critical temperatures of one - dimensional systems , which in addition implies a check on the various extrapolation methods that have been developed ; v ) verification of predicted bounds on the critical temperatures ; vi ) verification of a conjecture on the behavior of the critical temperature as a function of the decay parameter .",
    "another problem one encounters in the simulations is the large parameter space : the simulations for a set of different temperatures and system sizes have to be repeated for a range of values of the decay parameter and for @xmath7 .",
    "the total computing time dedicated to the results presented in this paper amounts to approximately two cpu - years on a modern workstation .",

    "this also holds for an even more stringent criterion by thouless,@xcite who generalized the argument of landau and lifshitz@xcite for the absence of a phase transition in an ising chain with short - range interactions . however , thouless argued on entropic grounds that _ if _ a phase transition exists for @xmath21 , the magnetization must have a _ discontinuity _ at the transition point .",
    "this was later dubbed the `` thouless effect '' by dyson , who proved it to occur in the closely related hierarchical model.@xcite simon and sokal made thouless argument partially rigorous,@xcite but later aizenman _",
    "et al._@xcite showed that , although a discontinuity in the order parameter _ is indeed present _ if there is a phase transition , his argument does _ not _ account for this .",

    "another interesting point is the rigorous proof for the existence of an intermediate ordered phase in the one - dimensional model with inverse - square interactions , where the two - point correlation function exhibits power - law decay with an exponent which varies continuously in a finite temperature range below the critical temperature.@xcite",
    "already in a very early stage of the history of the @xmath25-expansion , fisher , ma , and nickel analyzed the critical behavior of @xmath26-dimensional systems ( @xmath27 ) with long - range interactions decaying as @xmath28 , with @xmath29.@xcite they concluded that the upper critical dimension is given by @xmath30 , as was previously conjectured by stell@xcite and later rigorously proven by aizenman and fernndez.@xcite for more slowly decaying interactions , @xmath31 , the critical behavior is classical , whereas the critical exponents assume nonclassical , continuously varying values for @xmath32 .",
