    "dynamical lattices and their applications have become an area of increasing interest over the past decade , as shown by a multitude of recent reviews of the topic @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this growth was driven by a wide array of physical realizations , in fields as diverse as light propagation in optical waveguide arrays @xcite , dynamics of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in periodic potentials ( optical lattices ) @xcite , micro - mechanical cantilever arrays @xcite , models of dna @xcite , and others .",
    "a key model that has been widely used and analyzed in each of the above areas is the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation @xcite . in these applications , it emerges either as a tight - binding approximation ( as in the case of becs trapped in optical lattices ) , or at the level of an envelope - wave expansion of the underlying physical field ( such as the electromagnetic field of light in the optical systems ) .",
    "one aspect of this class of discrete dynamical models which remains perhaps less explored concerns their multi - component generalizations , which are relevant to many fields where dynamical lattices are natural models .",
    "for instance , in the case of waveguide arrays , one may consider settings with two orthogonal polarizations of light @xcite , or two different wavelengths , see e.g. , ref .",
    "similarly , in the bec context , one may consider multi - species condensates in the form of mixtures of different hyperfine states in @xmath1rb @xcite and @xmath2na @xcite , or mixtures of different atomic species , such as na  rb , k  rb , cs  rb , li  rb , as well as li  cs ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .    while the above settings are typically modeled by systems of dnls equations which are coupled by nonlinear terms , such as the ones accounting for the cross - phase modulation in optics , or collisions between atoms belonging to different bec species , it is also relevant to consider _ linearly coupled _ dnls equations ( or , in other discrete settings , linearly coupled ablowitz - ladik equations @xcite ) . in the optics context , such systems of linearly coupled dnls equations are relevant to various applications : for example , linear coupling occurs among the two modes inside each waveguide , which may be induced by a twist of the waveguide ( for linear polarizations ) , or by birefringence ( for circular polarizations ) , or in a dual - core structure of the waveguide @xcite . on the other hand , in becs , a linear coupling may be imposed by an external microwave or radio - frequency field , which can drive rabi @xcite or josephson @xcite oscillations between populations of two different states .    ; @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the asymmetry parameter and the half of the total squared norm , respectively ( see the text for the mathematical definitions ) .",

    "a unique advantage of performing this analysis in the discrete setting is that the bifurcation diagram can be produced not only for one - dimensional ( 1d ) , but also for two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattices .",

    "hence there exists a region of bistability . to additionally demonstrate the accuracy of the va , fig .",
    "[ solns ] presents comparison of the solution profiles at @xmath63 , together with the spectral plane , @xmath64 , for the corresponding eigenvalues , @xmath65 .",
    "recall that in hamiltonian systems , such as the one considered here , if @xmath41 is an eigenvalue , so are also @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , hence , if an eigenvalue with a nonzero real part exists , then the system will be linearly unstable .    for those 1d solutions",
    "that are linearly unstable due to a real eigenvalue , such as the unstable asymmetric solutions for @xmath69 and the symmetric ones for @xmath70 , we have examined their evolution in fig .",
    "[ timeevo ] by means of direct simulations of eq .",
    "( [ lincoup ] ) . in the case of the unstable asymmetric branch ,",
    "the result of the evolution depends on the nature of the corresponding perturbation , due to the presence of the bistability in the corresponding parameter range : the solution ends up oscillating around either the stable asymmetric solution , or the stable symmetric one .",
    "the evolution of the unstable symmetric branch naturally results in oscillations around the stable asymmetric profile , which represents the ground state in that case .",
    "an important observation in comparing figs .  [ eps0 ] and",
    "[ branches ] is that the bifurcation found in the anti - continuum limit shown in fig .",
    "[ eps0 ]  is definitely supercritical , unlike the weakly subcritical one in fig .",
    "[ branches ] .",
    "this indicates that the character of the bifurcation changes from subcritical to supercritical pitchfork with the increase of discreteness , i.e. ,  decrease of @xmath16 .",
    "this transition should eliminate the unstable asymmetric branches . in accordance with this expectation",
    ", we have found that the unstable asymmetric solutions exist only for @xmath71 , in the 1d case .",
    "we now turn to the results for the 2d model collected in fig .",
    "[ branches2d ] . here ,",
    "the results are even more interesting , for a number of reasons . on the one hand",
    ", there is no continuum analog to the bifurcation diagram , as the respective 2d continuum solutions are always unstable to collapse .",
    "discreteness is well - known to arrest collapse @xcite , generating branches of potentially stable localized solutions for sufficiently small values of the inter - site coupling constant ( at a given chemical potential ) , or for sufficiently large chemical potential ( at a given inter - site coupling ) , in one - component models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the 2d case , for a given value of the norm , there are two coexisting symmetric solutions , one ( taller and narrower ) with a larger chemical potential , which is stable , and one ( shorter and wider ) with a smaller chemical potential , which is unstable . as fig .",
    "[ branches2d ] implies , the symmetry - breaking weakly subcritical pitchfork bifurcation _ typically _ occurs from the stable branch of the symmetric solution , the corresponding critical point in fig .",
    "[ branches2d ] being @xmath72 . similarly to the 1d case , there is also a saddle - node bifurcation between the unstable and stable asymmetric branches , which occurs at @xmath73 and is responsible for the turning point .    in the 2d model too , the va accurately captures the trends of the numerical results , even though the less accurate nature of the 2d ansatz prevents a quantitative matching of the resulting bifurcation diagrams .",
    "detailed profiles of the numerical solutions and their va - predicted counterparts are shown in figs .",
    "[ solns2d1 ] and [ solns2d2 ] , for the asymmetric and symmetric branches respectively , at @xmath74 .",
    "two additional remarks are in order here .",
    "firstly , similar to the 1d case , the 2d bifurcation changes character from weakly subcritical ( as observed in fig .",
    "[ branches2d ] ) to supercritical ( as seen in the anti - continuum limit of @xmath42 ) at @xmath75 . on the other hand , as @xmath16 further increases , the stable part of the symmetric branch ( in fig .",
    "[ branches2d ] ) shrinks and eventually disappears at @xmath76 .",
    "finally , we have again examined the dynamics of linearly unstable solutions , upon appropriate perturbations , through direct simulations , see figs .",
    "[ timeevo2d1 ] and [ timeevo2d2 ] . in the former figure ,",
    "we have explored how the bistability , which is shown for a range of @xmath4 in fig .",
    "[ branches2d ] ,  kicks \" the unstable asymmetric solution either in the direction of its stable asymmetric counterpart , or towards the stable symmetric solution [ it is relevant to stress here , in connection with fig .",
    "[ branches2d ] , that , while the symmetric solution has a norm threshold at @xmath77 , the stable asymmetric solution can , in principle , be found at _ lower _ norms than the symmetric one , thus allowing the system to effectively decrease its  excitation threshold \" @xcite ] . in the latter figure , we consider the unstable symmetric branch , both when a stable symmetric branch does not exist , in which case the solution becomes asymmetric ( top row ) , and when a stable symmetric branch does exist , in which case the system evolves towards that solution ( bottom row ) .",
    "in this work , we have introduced the model based on two linearly coupled lattices with the cubic nonlinearity , and investigated its dynamical properties in detail .",
    "we have demonstrated that , in a number of respects , the discrete system emulates its continuum 1d counterpart , analyzed earlier in refs .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the lattice model gives rise to novel features . even in the 1d setting , varying the strength of the lattice inter - site coupling may be used to switch the character of the bifurcation from subcritical to supercritical pitchfork , as the coupling gets weaker , and the anti - continuum limit is approached . in the more interesting 2d setting ,",
    "our work is the first manifestation , to the best of our knowledge , of the existence of such a bifurcation diagram , since in the continuum limit the symmetry - breaking models with the self - focusing nonlinearity are irrelevant due to the collapse instability .",
    "furthermore , the discreteness induces the presence of both stable and unstable branches of symmetric solutions , thus enriching the bifurcation diagram . in the 2d case , not only",
    "is it possible for weaker lattice coupling to turn the bifurcation from subcritical to supercritical , but it is also possible for the lattice ( when the bifurcation is subcritical ) to possess a lower excitation threshold for asymmetric states than for the symmetric ones .",
    "all of these features demonstrate critical modifications that the discreteness imposes on the well - known symmetry - breaking picture in continuum models",
    ".    it might be quite interesting to examine similar features in 3d and compare the results with their 2d and 1d counterparts .",
    "of perhaps even more physical interest , especially in terms of coupled hyperfine states in becs , would be to add nonlinear coupling between the lattice components , of the cross - phase - modulation type , to the linear coupling considered here",
    ". it would be particularly interesting to examine how the symmetry - breaking phenomenology is affected by the gradual increase of such a coupling .",
