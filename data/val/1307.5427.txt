    "the observation of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) metallic state at the interface of two insulating oxides laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 ( lao / sto ) @xcite has brought forward a novel class of high - mobility electron gases ( egs ) which proves to be important in both theoretical and practical prospects .",
    "the occurrence of superconductivity in this 2deg@xcite and in similar heterostructures such as latio@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 ( lto / sto),@xcite with the possibility to control the transition by voltage gating , has further attracted great attention .",
    "there is however increasing evidence that inhomogeneity plays a relevant role in these systems . not only is the large width of the superconducting transition measured in transport experiments a clear indication of charge inhomogeneity,@xcite but also magnetometry,@xcite tunneling,@xcite and piezoforce spectroscopy@xcite report inhomogeneities on a submicrometric scale .",
    "extrinsic mechanisms , like impurities and defects , surely introduce inhomogeneities.@xcite however , the recent discovery of negative compressibility in a low filling regime@xcite provides , in our opinion , a clear indication that _ intrinsic _ mechanisms ( i.e. , effective electron - electron attractions ) are present , which may render these 2degs inhomogeneous by phase separation even in a perfectly clean and expectedly homogeneous system . moreover ,",
    "even if such mechanisms were not strong enough to drive the eg unstable , they would still increase the charge susceptibility , reinforcing the extrinsic mechanisms .",
    "several mechanisms providing negative contributions to the electronic compressibility are known,@xcite like the exchange term of the repulsive electron - electron interaction or the confinement mechanism forcing the eg at the interface .",
    "the former mechanism is only active at very low densities ( even for semiconducting systems ) up to a threshold density @xmath1 , which is further reduced by large values of the dielectric constant .",
    "therefore , this mechanism is surely not effective at the densities relevant for the metallic regime of the 2deg in lxo / sto interfaces ( henceforth , the symbol lxo stands for lao or lto , whenever we generically refer to both ) , where the typical electron density is quite large , of order of @xmath2 electrons per cell , and the sto dielectric constant may reach very high values , of order of @xmath3 . on the other hand , concerning the latter mechanism ,",
    "the self - consistent solution of the schrdinger and poisson equations relating the electronic wavefunctions and the electric potential arising from external potential and electronic density itself usually shows@xcite that the eg becomes more compressible once its finite transverse confinement is taken into account .",
    "also in this case the large dielectric constant of the material hosting the eg favors its `` softening '' , leading to an increased compressibility .",
    "whether and under which conditions this mechanism may lead alone to a negative compressibility and to phase separation is presently under investigation.@xcite in this general framework , looking for possible realistic sources of intrinsic mechanisms of phase separation , we recently proposed a possible explanation for the occurrence of an inhomogeneous electronic phase , which is based on a coupling between the electron orbital degree of freedom and its spin.@xcite the confinement of the 2deg at the interface restricts the electronic motion to the plane parallel to the interface , while the electric field confining the electrons is oriented perpendicularly . in this configuration ,",
    "the interaction between the moving electron and the electric field gives rise to the so - called rashba spin - orbit coupling ( rsoc);@xcite in simple terms , the moving electron perceives the electric field as a magnetic field in its rest frame , which then couples to its spin . as it will be explained in detail below , the key point of our argument",
    "is the dual role assumed by the confining electric field ; the field is proportional to the electron density and controls at the same time the rsoc .",
    "this leads to a density - dependent rsoc ( via the electric field ) . since the band structure depends on the strength of the coupling , the system acquires a _ non - rigid band structure _ which evolves as a function of the electron density .",
    "this non - rigidity gives rise to a 2deg which may differ strongly from a standard metallic system with rigid bands .",
    "for instance , the chemical potential @xmath4 in the latter case is an increasing function of the electron density @xmath5 and the compressibility @xmath6 is always positive .",
    "this statement holds no longer true for a system with non - rigid bands ; the 2deg may be in a ( thermodynamically unstable ) phase with a negative compressibility and separate into two sub - phases with densities @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the analysis of the precise conditions leading to such an unstable phase will be the focus of this paper , which is organized as follows .",
    "in section [ sect_model ] we present in detail our model used for the description of the 2deg at the interface .",
    "we study the model at zero and low temperatures as well as zero and small in - plane magnetic field and report the obtained results in section [ sect_results]-[magn - field ] .",
    "our concluding remarks are given in section [ sect_conclusion ] .",
    "the prototype systems we have in mind are oxide heterostructures formed by an sto bulk with a thin lxo film ( of the order of a few unit cells ) on top [ fig . [ polarcat](a ) ] .",
    "the lxo film consists of alternating _ polar _ layers of ( lao)@xmath9 and ( xo@xmath10)@xmath11 , with x@xmath12al , ti , whereas the sto bulk is formed by _ non - polar _ layers of tio@xmath10 and sro .",
    "this difference in polarity leads to a charge discontinuity at the interface .",
    "depending on the termination , two different types of interface may arise : xo@xmath10/lao",
    "/ tio@xmath10 , called _ n - type _ , and xo@xmath10/sro / tio@xmath10 , called _",
    "p - type_. in both cases , the charge discontinuity at the interface leads to a build - up of the electrical potential in the lxo film which increases monotonically with the number of layers and would diverge for an infinite number of layers . due to this ( theoretical ) divergence , the scenario is termed _",
    "polarity catastrophe_.@xcite according to theory , the system avoids this unphysical limit through a redistribution of the charges at the interface . by adding half an electron per unit cell to the interfacial tio@xmath10 layer coming from the uppermost xo@xmath10 layer ( n - type ) , or by removing half an electron from the interfacial sro plane in the form of oxygen vacancies ( p - type ) , a small",
    "dipole arises that causes the electric field to oscillate about zero and the potential to remain bounded .",
    "while n - type interfaces exhibit a metallic behavior , experiments show that p - type interfaces are insulating .",
    "the experiments further report a smaller transferred amount of charge of order @xmath13 electrons per unit cell ( el./u.c.),@xcite instead of the theoretical @xmath14el./u.c .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ polarcat](b ) for an illustration ) .",
    "these charges create a strong electric field , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the dielectric constant of lxo and @xmath17 m is the linear size of the sto unit cell .",
    "the polarity catastrophe is not the only mechanism leading to the formation of a 2deg at the lxo / sto interface .",
    "the gas can be also formed as a consequence of oxygen vacancies ( mostly located in lxo , which is interposed between lto and vacuum ) , that act as electron dopants , each oxygen vacancy nominally providing two electrons [ see fig .",
    "[ polarcat](c ) ] .",
    "these additional electrons then are confined at the interface by the self - consistent potential due to the other electrostatic fields ( e.g. , bulk fields or gates ) and the electronic density itself . solving the schrdinger and poisson equations one finds that this confining potential generates an electric field perpendicular to the interface which is roughly proportional to the density of the confined electrons .",
    "therefore also oxygen vacancies eventually produce an interface field , which is strictly related to the local density of the 2deg , similarly to the outcome of the polarity catastrophe .",
    "the orders of magnitude , as expected in the presence of similar confined densities , should be comparable .    in our model , we focus on n - type interfaces . for the sake of concreteness , but without being necessarily tied to this mechanism , we consider here electronic charges due to the polarity catastrophe and explore a range of values of @xmath18 up to @xmath19el / u.c .",

    "typically , the voltage is applied by back - gating to the sto bulk alone , while the interface is kept at @xmath23 v. applying a voltage @xmath24v to a layer of thickness @xmath25 m yields an electric field @xmath26vm@xmath21 , which is orders of magnitude smaller than the electric field due to the polarity catastrophe , @xmath22 [ see fig .",

    "the authors arrived at yet another conclusion , reporting that the induced spin - orbit coupling in the @xmath51 and @xmath52 bands is cubic in @xmath65 , whereas the spin - orbit interaction in the lower band ( @xmath48 ) , has a linear momentum dependence .",

    "however , the similarity of the 2deg at the sto surface to those reported in sto - based heterostructures suggests that different forms of electron confinement at the surface of sto should lead to essentially the same 2deg@xcite .    in the present paper , we shall mainly consider a model with linear rsoc and an expedient band structure composed of one anisotropic band with mass @xmath66 separated by @xmath67mev from two anisotropic bands with masses @xmath66 and @xmath68 , allowing for a simpler analytical treatment . for completeness , in appendix",

    "a comment is now in order about the choice of the field - dependent rsoc in eq .",

    "this additional field , no matter how small , has been shown in ref . to always produce phase separation at low enough densities ( @xmath117 el./u.c . ) for the linear  in - k rsoc considered there .",
    "however , we are interested in the typical regime of real materials with densities @xmath118 el./u.c . therefore , in order to keep the smallest number of model parameters , we omit this term , which , in any case , favors the occurrence of phase separation and therefore would strengthen our conclusions .    as will become clearer below",
    ", the possibility of a phase separation depends only marginally on the precise density dependence of the rsoc .",
    "the crucial point is that when the fermi energy enters the heavy bands , the coupling and/or its derivative with respect to @xmath18 need to exceed a certain value in order for the instability to occur .      from the band structure",
    "we deduce the density of states ( dos ) : @xmath119 where the subscript @xmath5 reminds us that , like the band structure , also the dos depends on the density .",
    "these density dependencies add some subtleties to the calculation of the chemical potential which we will discuss in the following .",
    "we begin by considering the simple example of a constant dos @xmath120 and a density - dependent band bottom @xmath121 , in which case the fermi level @xmath122 reads @xmath123 and the total energy per unit cell is given by @xmath124 differentiating once ( twice ) with respect to the density we obtain the chemical potential ( inverse compressibility ) @xmath125 the inverse compressibility , instead of being equal to @xmath126 as in the standard case of a constant band structure , has two additional contributions coming from the density dependence of the energy .",
    "therefore , we find that already in the simplified case of a constant dos , the density dependence of @xmath127 introduces new terms to the chemical potential and its derivative .",
    "next , we address the implications of the density dependence of the dos . to calculate the thermodynamic properties of the system we consider the grand - canonical ensemble defined by the potential @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the free energy and @xmath130 the total particle number of the system . in this ensemble",
    "the chemical potential is fixed while the particle density @xmath131 is a fluctuating quantity ( @xmath132 is the number of lattice sites ) . to be precise , the fluctuating quantity here is @xmath18 , while @xmath27 is univocally fixed by the gating @xmath41 , which is an external parameter .",
    "therefore , when we calculate the chemical potential via the density - dependent grand - canonical potential , the density [ and therefore also @xmath133 is not known a priori .",
    "an elegant way to circumvent this problem is the introduction of a lagrange multiplier @xmath134 ; we take the energy to be dependent on a real parameter @xmath135 , determine the chemical potential @xmath136 , and then chose @xmath134 to impose @xmath137 .",

    "the worst - case situation sets a lower bound to the size of inhomogeneities .",
    "assuming , as it seems to be more realistic , that the charge distribution in the lxo / sto heterostructure is not rigid , the possibility arises that an inhomogeneous distribution of electrons at the interface is ( at least partially ) balanced by a corresponding redistribution of opposite countercharges at the top of ( and possibly inside ) the lxo film , leading to an increase of the size of the inhomogeneous regions .",
    "we stress that these adjustments are _ not _ necessarily due to any displacement of ionic positions , but may simply arise from small variations of the x@xmath12al , ti ion valency [ see fig .",

    "then , the thickness of the lxo film being small , the negative charges at the interface and the positive countercharges at the top of the lxo film can be considered as a neutral system over distances larger than the thickness of the lxo layer .    of course one should worry about the fact that inside the lxo layer the inhomogeneous distribution of charges produces an inhomogeneous electric field distribution like in joined capacitors with different surface charges on their plates ( see fig .",
    "[ polarcat_withoutcoulomb ] ) .",
    "this will generate an increase of electrostatic energy with respect to the homogeneous case , likely overcoming the phase separation gain .",
    "however , one should bear in mind that i ) the charge reconstruction precisely occurs _ to avoid _ the presence of an average electric field in the interstitial polar planes of lxo and ii ) this reconstruction is only partial because the interface charge , even taking into account possible trapping of charge carriers , never coincides with the nominally required @xmath289 el./u.c .",
    "( the density of charge carriers is roughly ten times smaller ) .",
    "the real amount @xmath18 of charges transferred from the lxo top layer ( or bulk ) to the interface region is unknown .",

    "it is really awkward to estimate , e.g. , the different energy cost for transferring to the interface , say , 0.4 el / u.c .",
    "uniformly or creating inhomogeneous regions with 0.38 and 0.42 el / u.c . this estimate would involve : a ) dft calculations keeping track of the rigidity of small valence fluctuations of ti ions ; b ) the screening associated with tiny lattice deformations of the lxo planes ; c ) the possibility for a slightly non uniform redistribution of the charge in the intermediate ionic planes : the nominal polarity catastrophe distribution ( 0.5 ) ( @xmath851 ) ( + 1 ) ...",

    ", all these effects related to the polarity catastrophe could well coexist and cooperate with a not fully uniform distribution of the oxygen vacancies .",
    "an analysis of all these issues is far beyond the scope of our paper and an analysis by means , e.g. , of dft calculations , would be made difficult by the smallness of the charge imbalances and of the related energies involved ( a few mev ) so that a first - principle analysis would be very delicate .",
    "it is however conceivable that small redistributions of the charge in the top layer and in the internal polar planes of lxo balance the excess ( or lack ) of electrons in the 2deg without creating substantial changes in the electric field inside the lxo . in this respect ,",
    "we point out that the worst - case scenario of a rigid background already gives rise to large enough inhomogeneities to justify our analysis of phase separation .",
    "_ additional _ mechanisms related to the charge flexibility of these systems can only extend the effects of phase separation in generating the experimentally observed inhomogeneous interface state .",
    "based on a simple and general model we demonstrated that , as soon as the rashba coupling depends on the density , the possibility for an intrinsic electronic phase separation arises . in this framework",
    ", we showed that the instability occurs for reasonable values of the rashba coupling and the band structure parameters .",
    "we then systematically analyzed how the phase separation instability changes upon varying the gating @xmath41 , the temperature @xmath150 and the magnetic field @xmath38 ( applied parallel to the interface ) . the dependence on the parameters defining the rsoc , @xmath105 and @xmath106 , and the band structure @xmath50 and the heavy - to - light mass ratio @xmath290 is discussed in appendix a , whereas the case of more realistic band structures is dealt with in appendix b. also the case of a @xmath65-cubic rsoc is addressed in appendix c , where a coupling is considered leading to a band splitting of the same order of the one obtained in ref . .",
    "in all the above cases , a main finding of our work is the possible occurrence of the phase separation instability for quite realistic values of the rsoc as soon as the heavier ( mostly with @xmath175 character ) bands start to be filled .",
    "the filling of these bands , despite their location at higher energies @xmath291 ev , is a reasonable occurrence at the accessible electron densities both on experimental@xcite and theoretical grounds.@xcite furthermore , the idea that qualitatively new physics then emerges when the heavier @xmath51 and @xmath52 bands start to be filled is also gaining consensus on the basis of both theoretical results@xcite and experimental evidences.@xcite our scenario does not contradict these evidences , but suggests that these new physical effects may occur on an intrinsically inhomogeneous state .    in our opinion , a negative compressibility like the one measured in ref . can not be explained by impurities , defects and so on , but is a distinct signature of an intrinsic mechanism leading to an effective charge segregating attraction like the one proposed here.@xcite    in any case , the instability gives rise to dome - shaped coexistence surfaces in the parameter spaces below which the electronic reconstruction due to the polarity catastrophe and the related electron densities can not occur homogeneously , but rather give rise to domains with different densities .",
    "the maxwell construction only determines the densities of the coexisting phases , but says nothing on the size and structure of the phase separated regions .",
    "these non universal details are instead determined by the energy cost of the interfaces between regions with different densities , by the strain effects , and so on . the residual amount ( if any ) of coulombic forces opposing phase separation ,",
    "also contributes to non universal features like size and shape of the inhomogeneous regions.@xcite    another remarkable finding is related to the closing of the phase - separation domes upon varying the gating potential .",
    "this gives rise to quantum critical points of a novel type , where the landau damped electron density fluctuates with a relatively large dynamical critical index @xmath257,@xcite or @xmath258 .",
    "the fact that ( nearly ) neutral large - scale density fluctuations might occur in these systems is the key point allowing to escape the coulombic frustration usually invoked to produce @xmath292 critical fluctuations.@xcite of course , the possibility is also open that coulombic forces frustrate the phase separation giving rise to charge - density waves ( or even anharmonic stripes ) similar to what has been proposed in high @xmath245 cuprates,@xcite likely yielding a dynamical critical index @xmath293.@xcite    recent experiments@xcite do reveal the presence of quantum critical behavior under magnetic field in the low voltage region , suggesting non trivial interplay between the superconducting fluctuations and the nanoscale inhomogeneities .",
    "work is in progress to investigate the possible connection between these observed quantum critical behaviors and the quantum critical points found in the present work .",
    "the generality of our model is based on the idea that rsoc arises at interfaces where a metallic 2deg forms with a density which self - consistently adjusts itself on the basis of a local confining electric field .",
    "if one allows the rsoc to depend on this density via the orthogonal electric field , the issue of a charge instability naturally arises .",
    "of course , the details of the system then enter to establish whether or not the frustration due to long - range coulombic forces is present or not .",
    "it is anyhow tempting to investigate whether our instability mechanism is applicable to other systems as well . for instance , one could consider an eg with a sizable rsoc and/or very low densities in quantum wells , at the boundaries of heavy metal alloys like bi@xmath294pb@xmath295 , on the reconstructed surfaces of ag(111 ) , in mosfet and semiconducting heterostructures at low densities , and on the surface of topological insulators .    previous work in strongly correlated systems@xcite shows that electron - electron correlations and electron - phonon coupling favor phase separation . therefore , while it is natural that weak repulsive electron - electron interactions turn out to weakly stabilize the phase - separation instability,@xcite strong correlations induce an intrinsic non - rigidity to the quasiparticle bands and may cooperate with the rsoc to produce a charge instability .    on more general grounds , the present analysis paves the way for further models apt to describe the inhomogeneities at the lxo / sto interface . from experiments and",
    "theory we know that the superconducting state is inhomogeneous.@xcite as a possible variation / improvement of our approach , one could then think of a model with superconductivity in which the coupling constant between cooper pairs ( or even superconducting islands ) depends on the density .",
    "based on the current work , one expects that also in this case the effective attraction leads to an unstable eg .",
