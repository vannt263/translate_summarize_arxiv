    "the bohm - de broglie ( bdb ) interpretation @xcite@xcite@xcite has been sucessfully applied to quantum minisuperspace models @xcite , and to full superspace @xcite @xcite @xcite . in the first case , it was discussed the classical limit , the singularity problem , the cosmological constant problem , and the time issue . it was shown in scalar field and radiation models for the matter content of the early universe that quantum effects driven by the quantum potential can avoid the formation of a singularity through a repulsive quantum force that counteract the gravitational attraction .",
    "the quantum universe usually reach the classical limit for large scale factors .",
    "however , it is possible to have small classical universes and large quantum ones : it depends on the state vector and on initial conditions @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that the quantum evolution of homogeneous hypersurfaces form the same four - geometry independently on the choice of the lapse function @xcite .    in the present work we study the minisuperspace model given by a quantum friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe filled with dust and radiation decoupled from each other .",
    "we write down the hamiltonian that comes from the velocity potential schutz formalism @xcite . after implementing a canonical transformation ,",
    "the momentum associated to the radiation fluid @xmath0 and to the dust fluid @xmath1 appear linearly in the superhamiltonian constraint .",
    "both can be associated to time parameters , but physical reasons and mathematical simplicity led us to choose the coordinate @xmath2 associated with @xmath0 as the time parameter .",
    "this is equivalent to choose the ( reversed ) conformal time .",
    "we quantize this system obtaining a schrdinger - like equation .",
    "we analyze its time dependent solutions applying the bdb interpretation in order to study the scale factor quantum dynamics .",
    "we first consider an initial quantum state given by a gaussian superposition of the scale factor which is an eigenstate of the total dust mass operator ( matter is not being created nor destroyed in such states ) , and we compute the solution at a general subsequent time by means of the propagator approach .",
    "we calculate the bohmian trajectories for the scale factor . for flat and negative curvature spatial sections ,",
    "we find that the quantum solutions for the scale factor reach the classical behaviour for long times , but do not present any initial singularities due to quantum effects . in the same way , in the case of positive curvature spatial sections , the classical initial and final singularities are removed due to quantum effects , and the scale factor oscillates between a minimum and a maximum size . for large scale factor",
    ", the classical behaviour is recovered .",
    "however , such eigenfunctions of the total dust mass operator do not have unitary evolution .",
    "this led us to consider an initial state given by gaussian superpositions of the total dust matter content .",
    "in this situation , dust and radiation can be created and destroyed .",
    "we calculate general solutions for flat , negative and positive curvature spatial sections .",
    "in particular , for flat spatial sections , we construct a wave packet whose quantum trajectories represent universes which begin classically in an epoch where the dust matter has negative energy density ( exotic dust matter ) , evolving unitarily to a configuration where quantum effects avoid the subsequent classical big crunch singularity , performing a graceful exit to an expanding classical model filled with conventional matter and radiation .",
    "there is thus a transition from an exotic matter era to a conventional matter one due to quantum effects .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ bdbs ]",
    "we synthesize the basic features of the bohm - de broglie interpretation of quantum mechanics , which will be necessary to interpret our quantum model studied in other sections . in section [ drs ] , we briefly summarize the velocity potential schutz formalism , and we apply it to construct the hamiltonian of the flrw universe filled with two perfect fluids , which are dust and radiation . we then review and analyze the classical features of the two perfect fluids flrw model in order to have the results to be contrasted with the quantum models of the following sections . in section [ 1f ] , we present some new results concerning the existence of singularities in the quantization of the one fluid case .",
    "we show that , when the fluid is radiation , all quantum solutions do not present singularities . in section [ quantum ] , we quantize the model with two fluids , and we compute the solutions of the schrdinger like equation for two different initial conditions : the first being an eigenstate of the total dust matter operator , and the second a gaussian superposition of total dust matter eigenstates .",
    "we interpret the solutions according to the bdb view and we develop the main results of the paper .",
    "section [ conclu ] is for discussion and conclusions .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the basic principles of the bohm - de broglie ( bdb ) interpretation of quantum mechanics . according to this causal interpretation ,",
    "an individual physical system comprises a wave @xmath3 , which is a solution of the schrdinger equation , and a point particle that follows a trajectory @xmath4 , independent of observations , which is solution of the bohm guidance equation    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the phase of @xmath7 . in order to solve eq.([bohmg ] ) , we have to specify the initial condition @xmath8 .",
    "the uncertainty in the initial conditions define an ensemble of possible motions , @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "it is sufficient for our purposes to analyze the schrdinger equation for a non relativistic particle in a potential @xmath9 , which , in coordinate representation , is    @xmath10\\psi(x , t ) .\\ ] ]    substituting in ( [ s ] ) the wave function in polar form , @xmath11 , and separating into real and imaginary parts , we obtain the following two equations for the fields @xmath12 and @xmath13    @xmath14    @xmath15    equation ( [ equacaohj ] ) can be interpreted as a hamilton - jacobi type equation for a particle submitted to a potential , which is given by the classical potential @xmath9 plus a _ quantum potential _ defined as @xmath16 it is possible to verify that the particle trajectory @xmath17 satisfies the equation of motion    @xmath18    the classical limit is obtained when @xmath19 .",
    "the bdb interpretation does not need a classical domain outside the quantized system to generate the physical facts out of potentialities . in a real measurement",
    ", we do not see superpositions of the pointer apparatus because the measurement interaction causes the wave function to split up into a set of non overlapping packets .",
    "the particle will enter in one of them , the rest being empty , and it will be influenced by the unique quantum potential coming from the sole non zero wave function of this region .",
    "the particle can not pass to another branch of the superposition because they are separated by regions where @xmath20 , nodal regions .    in section [ quantum ] , the flrw minisuperspace model containing dust and radiation as two perfect decoupled fluids will be quantized .",
    "a preferred time variable can be chosen as one of the velocity potencials associated to the fluids ( radiation ) , yielding a schrdinger like equation .",
    "then the bdb interpretation of our quantum model runs like in ref .",
    "@xcite , in close analogy to the non relativistic particle model described above . in the present case",
    ", however , the scale factor of the universe will not be the only degree of freedom : the velocity potential associated with the dust field and its canonical momentum , interpreted as the dust total mass , are also present .",
    "they satisfy a hamilton - jacobi equation modified by an extra term , the quantum potential , so that their time evolution will be different from the classical one . the main features of this classical model we describe in the following section .",
    "we start by considering a perfect fluid in a flrw universe model .",
    "the line element is given by    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the lapse function , @xmath23 is the scale factor , and @xmath24 is the metric of the three - dimensional homogeneous isotropic static spatial section of constant curvature @xmath25 or @xmath26 .    following the schutz s canonical formalism to describe the relativistic dynamics of a perfect fluid in interaction with the gravitational field @xcite , we introduce the five velocity potentials , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the potentials @xmath29 and @xmath30 , which describe vortex motion , vanish in the flrw model because of its symmetry .",
    "the potential @xmath28 is the specific entropy and @xmath31 can be related with the temperature of the fluid . by now @xmath32 works only as a mathematical tool .",
    "the four - velocity of the fluid is obtained from the velocity potentials as    @xmath33    where @xmath34 stands for the specific enthalpy .",
    "the four velocity is normalized as @xmath35 using this equation , it is possible to write the specific enthalpy @xmath34 as a function of the velocity potentials .",
    "the action for a relativistic perfect fluid and the gravitational field in the natural units @xmath36 is given by    @xmath37    where @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the newton s constant ( hence @xmath40 is the planck length in the natural units ) , @xmath41 is the scalar curvature of the spacetime , @xmath42 is the pressure of the fluid , @xmath43 is the three metric on the boundary @xmath44 of the 4-dimensional manifold @xmath45 , and @xmath46 its extrinsic curvature .",
    "the velocity potentials are supposed to be functions of @xmath47 only , in accordance with the homogeneity of spacetime .",
    "the perfect fluid follows the equation of state @xmath48 .    substituting the metric ( [ metric ] ) into the action ( [ a ] ) , using the formalism of schutz @xcite to write the pressure of the fluid as @xmath49^{\\frac{\\lambda+1}{\\lambda } } \\exp{\\left(-\\frac{s}{s_{0r}\\lambda } \\right)},\\ ] ] with @xmath50 and @xmath51 constants , computing the canonical momenta @xmath52 for the fluid and @xmath53 for the gravitational field , using the two constraints equations @xmath54 , and performing the canonical transformation @xmath55 and @xmath56 leading to the momenta @xmath57 and @xmath58 we obtain for the final hamiltonian ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) , @xmath59 where @xmath22 plays the role of a lagrange multiplier whose variation yields the constraint equation @xmath60 where @xmath61 means ` weakly zero ' ( this phase space function is constrained to be zero , but its poisson bracket to other quantities is not ) .",

    "the tilda have been omitted .",
    "considering now two decoupled fluids , one being radiation ( @xmath66 ) , and the other dust matter ( @xmath67 ) , the hamiltonian reads : @xmath68    the classical hamilton equations are :    @xmath69    @xmath70    @xmath71    @xmath72    @xmath73    the superhamiltonian is constrained to vanish due to variation of the hamiltonian with respect to the lapse function @xmath22 , @xmath74 ,    @xmath75    the constraint ( [ ham0 ] ) combined with eqs .",

    "the presence of quantum effects can create exotic dust matter content .",
    "hence , for comparison , we analyze a classical universe filled with exotic dust , which means @xmath90 , i.e @xmath91 . for simplicity ,",
    "let us focus on the flat spatial case .    in the presence of exotic dust ,",
    "the behaviour of the scale factor is drastically different . from the friedmann eq.([friedmann ] ) , since @xmath91 , the radiation density must always be equal or greater then the dust density , otherwise the friedmann equation @xmath92 has no solution . for small values of the scale factor , the radiation term dominates .",
    "as the scale factor grows , the exotic dust term begins to be comparable to the radiation term up to the critical point where both are equal and @xmath93 .",
    "> from this point , the scale factor decreases until the universe recollapses .",
    "note that eq.([cdr ] ) for @xmath94 and @xmath91 implies that @xmath95 at all times .",
    "hence , contrary to the normal dust matter case where after the big bang the universe expands forever [ see eq.([cdr ] ) for @xmath94 ] , in the exotic case the universe recollapses in a big crunch",
    ". the qualitative evolution of the scale factor is plotted in figure 1 :    the deceleration parameter in conformal time is given by @xmath97 it diverges when the scale factor reaches its maximum value ( @xmath98 and @xmath95 ) .",
    "in this section , we present a general result concerning the presence of singularities in the quantization of a flrw model with radiation .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint in this case is @xmath99 and @xmath85 is conformal time , as discussed above .    using the dirac quantization procedure ,",
    "the hamiltonian constraint phase space function @xmath100 becomes an operator which must annihilate the quantum wave function : @xmath101 .",
    "one then obtains in natural units the wheeler - de witt equation for the minisuperspace flrw metric with radiation : @xmath102 note that a particular factor ordering has been chosen and , because @xmath103 appears linearly in eq.([hconstr ] ) , @xmath104 is chosen to be the time label in which the wave function evolves ( the sign reversing was done in order to express this quantum equation in a familiar schredinger form @xcite ) .",
    "the scale factor is defined only in the half line @xmath105 , which means that the superhamiltonian ( [ hconstr ] ) is not in general hermitian .",

    "we will now show that condition ( [ cond1 ] ) , together with the assumption that @xmath108 is analytic in @xmath85 at @xmath109 , implies that general quantum solutions of eq.([sch27 ] ) , when interpreted using the bdb interpretation , yield quantum cosmological models without any singularity .",

    "the same reasoning can be used for all higher derivatives @xmath122 at @xmath109 to show that they are all zero : one just have to use equation ( [ d2psi ] ) to substitute @xmath123 for @xmath124 and condition ( [ cond1 ] ) to substitute @xmath125 for @xmath126 at @xmath109 whenever they appear , and then use analyticity of @xmath7 in @xmath85 at @xmath109 .    with these results , if there is a time @xmath114 where @xmath115 , expanding @xmath127 in taylor series around @xmath114 shows that @xmath128 .",
    "this means that the only singular bohmian trajectory is the trivial one of not having a universe at all !",
    "all non trivial quantum solutions have to be non singular .",

    "again , far from the origin , radiation is conserved while in the origin , due to quantum effects , it is not conserved .    for the evolution of the scale factor , numerical integration of equation ( [ aevol ] )",
    "yields the plot of figure 6 .    in the far positive region",
    ", the scale factor behaves classically , as expected , and matter is conserved . on the other hand , in the far negative region",
    "the scale factor also behaves classically but with a universe filled with exotic dust , and here again matter is conserved ( compare this region with figure 1 ) .",
    "both regions have a consistent classical behaviour .",
    "hence , the universe begins classically from a big bang filled with exotic dust and conventional radiation .",
    "it evolves until it reaches a configuration when quantum effects avoid the classical big crunch while transforming exotic dust into normal dust . from this point on",
    ", the universe expands classically filled with conventional dust and radiation .",
    "in the present work we studied some features of the minisuperspace quantization of flrw universes with one and two fluids . for the one fluid case ( radiation )",
    ", we have generalized results in the literature by showing that all bohmian trajectories coming from reasonable general solutions of the wave equation obtained through the assumptions of unitarity and analyticity at the origin , do not present any singularity .",
    "hence , this quantum minisuperspace theory is free of singularities .",
    "for the two fluids case ( non interacting radiation and dust ) , we first obtained bohmian quantum universes free of singularities reaching the classical limit for large scale factors .",
    "however , these trajectories arise from eigenfunctions of the total dust mass operator whose time evolution is not unitary . when considering the general case , we managed to obtain a wave solution presenting unitary evolution with some surprising effects . now dust and radiation can be created but the new feature is the possibility of creation of exotic fluids . we have shown that dust matter can be created as a quantum effect in such a way that the universe can undergo a transition from an exotic dust matter era to a conventional dust matter one . in this transition , one can see from figure 5 that radiation also becomes exotic due to quantum effects , helping the formation of the bounce .",
    "the fluid approach is not fundamental , but we expect that it can be quite accurate in describing quantum aspects of the universe , in the same way the landau description of superfluids in terms of fluid quantization was capable of showing many quantum features of this system @xcite . after all , creation and annihilation of particles as well as quantum states with negative energy are usual in quantum field theory .",
    "the formalism developed in the present paper seems to be a simple and calculable way to grasp these features of quantum field theory .",
    "their physical applications may be important : exotic fluids are relevant not only in causing cosmological bounces and avoiding cosmological singularities @xcite , but also for the formation of wormholes @xcite and for superluminal travels @xcite .",
    "these are some developments of the present paper we want to explore in future works .",
