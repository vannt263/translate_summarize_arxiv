    "the analysis of interstellar absorption lines provides fundamental information about the content and physical conditions of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "absorption line spectroscopy can be used to study the ism in our galaxy , in nearby systems such as the magellanic clouds , and in the intergalactic medium out to the most distant qsos .",
    "these studies provide an opportunity to compare elemental abundances and physical conditions in regions with differing chemical histories .    as part of a general program to investigate the interstellar medium of the milky way and nearby galaxies , we have used the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( _ fuse _ ) satellite ( moos et al . 2000 ) to observe the star sk  -67  05 ( hd  268605 ) in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "the first observations of galactic halo gas with iue  were along sightlines to stars in the lmc ( savage & de boer 1979 ; 1981 ) . in this letter",
    "we discuss the first _ fuse _  observations of an lmc star revealing o@xmath0vi  absorption in both the milky way and lmc .",
    "we also discuss the measurements of h@xmath1 , , , , and absorption along this sightline .",
    "sk  -67  05 ( @xmath17 = 27889 , @xmath18 = -3632 ) is a b0 ia star ( smith neubig & bruhweiler 1999 ) located near the western edge of the lmc .",
    "it lies in a diffuse region ( chu et al .",
    "1994 ) with relatively low diffuse x - ray emission compared to regions closer to the center of the lmc ( snowden & petre 1994 ) .",
    "ardeberg et al .",
    "( 1972 ) give = -0.12 , and for ( ) @xmath19 = -0.23 ( binney & merrifield 1998 ) , we find e ( ) = 0.11 .",
    "using the galactic gas - to - dust correlation ( diplas & savage 1994 ) we infer @xmath20 ( ) @xmath21 along this sightline .",
    "this star was observed during the in - orbit checkout phase of the mission ( sahnow et al .",
    "2000 ) at various times between 1999 august 20 and 1999 october 19 .",
    "as these observations were part of tests designed primarily to align the four optical channels in the instrument , the star was stepped across the @xmath22 aperture during the observations .",
    "however , the data were taken in time - tagged photon - address mode , so that corrections could be made for this image motion .",
    "the analysis here uses lif1 ( 990 - 1080   ) data only ; the lif2 channel has lower sensitivity and poorer flatfield characteristics , and during this period no flatfield corrections were available . the sic ( 905 - 1100   ) channels were generally not aligned .",
    "the instrument was still in its preflight focus configuration , and the spectral resolution was @xmath23 .",
    "the wavelength scale was established with a pre - flight dispersion solution . however , because of the stepping manner in which the data were obtained , additional zero point adjustments were required .",
    "relative velocities are generally accurate to @xmath2410 km  s@xmath25over limited spectral ranges , and the absolute scale was set by comparison with iue  spectra .",
    "the data presented represent a total of approximately 33 ksec of on - target exposure time for the lif1a and 35 ksec for the lif1b spectral regions , approximately equally split between day and night .",
    "additional details of the data processing for this data set can be found elsewhere ( massa et al . 2000 ) .",
    "this star exhibits variable stellar wind features .",
    "however , as shown in figure 3 of massa et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the variablility is minimal at the wavelengths of interest here , and does not affect our conclusions .",
    "figure 1 shows the composite spectrum from the lif1 channel .",
    "several metal lines that appear in the ism of both the milky way and lmc are identified .",
    "most other lines are due to h@xmath1  absorption in the lmc .",
    "the strong emission line is terrestrial ly@xmath26 airglow from the daytime exposures .    in this analysis",
    "we have used only the 1031.93   member of the o@xmath0vi  doublet since the 1037.62   line is blended with @xmath27 1037.02   and several h@xmath1  lines .",
    "figure 2 shows the _ fuse _",
    "o@xmath0vi  @xmath28 absorption line and a high - dispersion iue  spectrum of the @xmath29 .",
    "the h@xmath1  ( 6 - 0 ) p(3 ) line originating in the lmc appears at + 88 km  s@xmath25 , and must be modelled and removed to get an accurate estimate of the o@xmath0vi  column density .",
    "we have analyzed the ( 2 - 0 ) to ( 9 - 0 ) h@xmath1  lyman bands , using the method described in shull et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to determine the equivalent widths , @xmath18-values , and column densities for the milky way and lmc components of h@xmath1 .",
    "since the typical spacing between the rotational - vibrational lines within each lyman band is very close to the spacing between lmc and the milky way absorption , the measurement of the milky way h@xmath1  depends on a careful decomposition of blended lines . because of this difficulty , we used only the ( 4 - 0 ) and ( 2 - 0 ) lyman bands to measure the @xmath11 levels from the milky way gas .",
    "the results of the h@xmath1  model , discussed below , give @xmath30 n(h@xmath1 ) = 15.28 for the ( 6 - 0 ) p(3 ) in the lmc .",
    "this was convolved with the instrumental resolution of 25 km  s@xmath25  and divided out of the original spectrum to remove the effects of the h@xmath1  absorption .",
    "the resulting o@xmath0vi  profile is shown as a light line in fig .",
    "2 .    to calculate the o@xmath0vi  absorption we have considered two possible continuum placements , designated `` high '' and `` low , '' which are displayed in fig .",
    "2 as long - dashed and dash - dotted lines , respectively .",
    "the arrow at + 180 km  s@xmath25denotes the velocity we have adopted as separating the milky way and lmc components of o@xmath0vi .",
    "table 1 gives o@xmath0vi  equivalent widths derived using both continua .",
    "figure 3 shows the spectra of several important metal lines and a molecular hydrogen line along the sightline to sk  -67  05 .",
    "for comparison , the iuespectrum of @xmath311808.01 is shown .",
    "the individual absorption lines have separately been shifted in velocity to align the milky way components with the corresponding feature in the iue  spectrum .",
    "we established the velocity scale for the o@xmath0vi  region by shifting the @xmath311020.70 line to match the @xmath311808.01 iue  velocity scale , which sets the velocities of the nearby h@xmath1  lyman ( 7 - 0 ) p(2 ) @xmath311016.46 and p(3 ) @xmath311019.50 lines .",
    "the ( 6 - 0 ) p(3 ) @xmath311031.19 and r(4 ) @xmath311032.35 lines were then used to establish the o@xmath0vi  velocity , as shown in fig .",
    "the measured equivalent widths of several interstellar metal lines are also given in table 1 .",
    "the adopted column densities for several ionic species , as well as several rotational states of h@xmath1 along this sightline , are given in table 2 .",
    "these were calculated by fitting to a single - component doppler - broadened curve of growth for fe@xmath0ii  and h@xmath1 , and by using the apparent column density method ( savage & sembach 1991 ) for the other species listed .",
    "the two values given for the o@xmath0vi  column are based on the high and low continuum placements .",
    "we have added a systematic error of 0.04 dex in quadrature with the statistical error for o@xmath0vi  to account for errors in continuum placement and the velocity interval over which the apparent column density is integrated .",
    "since 114 ev are required to convert o@xmath32 to o@xmath33 , o@xmath0vi  is almost never produced by photoionization from starlight .",
    "thus , it is a sensitive tracer of hot ( @xmath34 k ) collisionally ionized gas in the interstellar medium . adopting the high continuum placement shown in fig .",
    "2 , which we believe is more appropriate , the o@xmath0vi  column density is @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the milky way and lmc , respectively . for the mw gas , @xmath37sin@xmath38 $ ] = 14.17 , which agrees well with the median value of 14.21 along 11 galactic halo sightlines studied by savage et al . ( 2000 ) . here",
    "@xmath18 = -3632 is the galactic latitude .    using @xmath39 in the milky way from wakker et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and assuming an error of 0.05 dex , we find @xmath40 .",
    "if the low continuum is adopted , this ratio is @xmath41 . either value is greater than , but consistent with , the halo value @xmath42 determined from _ fuse_observations of four extragalactic sightlines ( savage et al .",
    "2000 ) , as well as @xmath43 from _ copernicus_and iue  observations of stars in the lower halo ( spitzer , 1996 ) .",
    "note that the widths of o@xmath0vi  components in both the mw and lmc are much broader than the thermal line width , which is @xmath4430 km  s@xmath25  ( fwhm ) for gas at 300,000 k. the substantial difference in the widths of the c@xmath0iv  and o@xmath0vilines may be due to the different scale heights in the galactic halo of these ions ( savage et al .",
    "2000 ) .    sk  -67  05 was the only star for which wakker et al .",
    "( 1998 ) did not detect c@xmath0iv  in their study of the lmc halo .",
    "we recalculated their upper limit to @xmath7 assuming the velocity range observed in the o@xmath0vi  gas ( @xmath45 to @xmath46 km  s@xmath25 ) and find @xmath47 . adopting the high continuum case we find @xmath48 for the lmc material along the sk  -67  05 sightline .",
    "the h@xmath1  column density varies greatly between the lmc and milky way . for the lmc we find @xmath8 , summed over the @xmath49 to 5 states ( table 2 ) , and a @xmath18-value of @xmath50 km  s@xmath25 .",
    "this column density is significantly higher than that measured along other lmc sightlines ( de boer et al .",
    "1998 ; shull et al .",
    "2000 ) . by comparison ,",
    "observations of the metal deficient galaxy i zw 18 , have yielded only an upper limit , @xmath51 ( vidal - madjar et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the distribution of h@xmath1  rotational states in the lmc is best fitted by a two - component excitation temperature ( fig .",
    "4 ) with @xmath52 k for @xmath11 and @xmath53 k for @xmath13 .",
    "this is similar to the temperature distribution seen along the sightline to star lh10:3120 in the lmc using orfeus ( de boer et al .",
    "this indicates that the gas is not in thermal equilibrium , and the higher @xmath54 states are fluorescently pumped by uv radiation .",
    "this excited gas may therefore exist in the outer , optically thin regions of the cloud . in the interior regions the molecular fraction may increase due to self - shielding , which is expected when e ( ) @xmath55 0.1 ( savage et al . 1977 ) .",
    "the @xmath56 point falls almost exactly on the extension of the @xmath57 line , suggesting that the density of this gas is rather high .    for the milky way gas",
    "we find an h@xmath1 column density of @xmath58 , summed over the @xmath49 to 3 states ( table 2 ) , and a rotational temperature of @xmath59 k ( fig .",
    "this temperature is similar to other values measured with",
    "( shull et al .",
    "2000 ) and to _ copernicus _  measurements of galactic stars ( savage et al . 1977 ) .",
    "there is an indication of a two - component temperature distribution for the milky way gas as well .",
    "however , because of the relatively small number of measurable lines and severe blending , we are unable to accurately determine an excitation temperature for the higher-@xmath54 mw material .    absorption from both milky way and lmc material is clearly seen in all of the low ions present in the lif1 data ( e.g. , figs . 1 and 3 ) .",
    "blending of atomic , ionic , and h@xmath1  absorption along this sightline limits the number of species for which we can derive accurate equivalent widths and column densities .",
    "the depleted species fe@xmath0ii  has several well - observed transitions in our dataset ( table 1 ) . we have constructed a single - component doppler - broadened curve of growth for the fe@xmath0ii  lines observed in both the milky way and the lmc . the best fit yields @xmath60 and @xmath61 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 km  s@xmath25  for the milky way and lmc , respectively .",
    "due to potential uncertainties in some of the @xmath64-values we have adopted a conservative error of 0.1 dex in these column densities .",
    "our data permit good measurements of the non - depleted species @xmath311152.82 , and we derive lower limits to the milky way and lmc column densities ( table 2 ) using the apparent column density method of savage & sembach ( 1991 ) .",
    "if the @xmath18-values for are similar to those derived for fe@xmath0ii , the data suggest only very moderate saturation corrections of @xmath65 dex .",
    "for the sightline through the halo of the milky way , we derive a gas - phase abundance @xmath66 } \\equiv \\log n(\\mbox{\\ion{fe}{2 } } ) - \\log n(\\mbox{\\ion{p}{2 } } ) - \\log ( { \\rm fe / p})_\\odot \\sim -0.6 $ ] , assuming a solar system ratio of @xmath67 ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) . for the lmc gas along this direction",
    "we find @xmath66 } \\sim -0.7 $ ] .",
    "this suggests significant incorporation of iron into dust grains in both galaxies .",
    "differences in the relative abundance of singly- and doubly - ionized iron and phosphorous could affect this measurement ( sembach et al .",
    "2000 ) , but the magnitude of this effect is likely to be much too small to account for the gas - phase deficiency of iron along this sightline .",
