    "the recent discovery of three millisecond pulsar ( msp ) binary systems that alternate between clearly distinguishable rotation- and accretion - powered states have revealed a new aspect of compact binaries containing neutron stars @xcite . in their accreting states ,",

    ", we examined the x - ray and optical / uv properties of the bright _ rosat _ source 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820 , which is positionally coincident with the high - energy @xmath1-ray source 3fgl j1544.61125 @xcite .",
    "the variability and spectral properties of this system were found to be essentially identical to those observed from the nearby transitional millisecond pulsar binaries psr j1023 + 0038 @xcite and xss j122704859 @xcite .",
    "the available observational evidence points to 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820   most probably being a transitional msps in a low - luminosity accreting state , making it only the fourth such system to be identified .",
    "two of the transitional msps , xss j122704859 and psr j18242452i , are currently in a dormant , accretion - disk - free state @xcite , leaving only psr j1023 + 0038 and 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820  available for further detailed studies of the accreting state . at present , the underlying physical processes responsible for the observed phenomenology , especially the rapid x - ray mode switching and unexpectedly bright high - energy @xmath1-ray emission associated with the accreting state , are poorly understood . in light of the transitory nature of the accreting state , it is therefore crucially important to investigate each system extensively at all wavelengths before a transformation to a possibly prolonged non - accreting episode ( lasting years to decades ) .",
    "on - going multiwavelength studies of psr j1023 + 0038 in its present accreting state @xcite are revealing new information regarding the accretion and jet production processes that operate in transitional msps . in this paper ,",

    "( _ nustar _ ) , which further confirm the similarities of this system with transitional msps .",
    "i also investigate the broad band spectral energy distribution and long - term variability of the system , which further strenghten the classification of this system as a transitional msp .",

    "5 i discuss the broad band spectral energy distribution of 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820 .",
    "i offer a discussion in  6 and conclusions in  7 .",
    "the 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820  system was observed with _ nustar",
    "_ @xcite on 23 march 2015 ( obsid 90001007 ) in a 40 ks effective on - source exposure obtained through the director s discretionary program .",
    "_ nustar _ is the first focusing hard x - ray telescope , with sensitivity over the 379 kev energy range .",
    "it consists of two co - aligned telescopes , which use grazing - incidence mirror assemblies to focus hard x - rays onto two focal plane modules , fpma and fpmb .",
    "the data were processed using the nupipeline script in nustardas and the images , spectra , and light curves were generated using the nuproducts task .",
    "1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820  is the only hard x - ray source within the telescope field of view and is detected with high significance up to @xmath230 kev .",
    "for both the spectroscopic and time variability analyses , the source counts were extracted from a circular region of radius @xmath4 ( which encircles @xmath280% of the total source energy ) centered on the optical position reported in @xcite .",
    "the background was taken from a @xmath4 radius source - free region .",
    "112820jointly fitted with an absorbed power - law model .",
    "the bottom panel shows the best fit residuals expressed in terms of @xmath5 with error bars of size unity .",

    "i conducted a spectral analysis in xspec version 12.8.2 @xcite . to maximize the photon statistics ,",
    "the fpma and fpmb spectra and response functions were combined using the addascaspec command in ftools . based on the results from the _ xmm - newton _ spectroscopy presented in @xcite , the _ nustar _ fpma and fpmb spectra",
    "were fitted with an absorbed power - law assuming the tbabs interstellar absorption model and chemical abundances from @xcite .",
    "this produces a best fit with hydrogen column density of @xmath6 @xmath7 , spectral photon index @xmath8 , an unabsorbed @xmath9 kev flux of @xmath10 erg @xmath7 s@xmath11 , and @xmath12 for 156 degrees of freedom . owing to the hard response of _ nustar _",
    ", the fit is insensitive to the value of @xmath13 and only a crude upper limit is obtained . to further refine the spectral parameters , i also conducted a joint fit to the _ xmm - newton _ and _ nustar _ data .",
    "the resulting best fit with an absorbed power - law gives @xmath14 @xmath7 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 erg @xmath7 s@xmath11 ( 0.379 kev ) , with @xmath17 for 471 degrees of freedom .",
    "all uncertainties quoted are at a 90% confidence level .",
    "no adjustment to the cross - normalizations between the two data sets was required . as apparent from figure 1 , the spectral continuum shows no evidence for a break or turn - over within the _ nustar _ band .",
    "i also explored the possibility of spectral variability by computing the hardness ratio variations as a function of count rate .",
    "there are no statistically significant differences in hardness between the high and low flux modes , which is consistent with the result from the _ nustar _ data of psr j1023 + 0038 in its accreting state @xcite .",
    "a total background - subtracted hard x - ray light curve was generated by combining the emission from fpma and fpmb .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the soft x - ray emission exhibits rapid switching between two flux modes , with ingress and egress durations lasting of order 10 s. despite the much lower count rate compared to the 0.310 kev _ xmm - newton _ light curve , the rapid variability is still clearly apparent .",
    "the 379 kev light curve of 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820 , binned at 100 s resolution , is shown in figure 2 . while the source spends most of the time at a high flux level ( @xmath20.1 counts s@xmath11 ) , multiple instances of low flux levels ( reaching down to @xmath20.01 counts s@xmath11 ) are evident . at the 100 s bin resolution",
    "some short - lived low modes are likely averaged with the high modes occuring within the same time bin . a kuiper s test for time variability on the unbinned time series , corrected for good time intervals by removing gaps in exposure , gives a @xmath18 ( @xmath197.9@xmath5 ) probability that a distribution with a constant count rate would exhibit the observed level of non - uniformity . due to the relatively low source count rate , the unknown orbital period , as well as known calibration issues with the _ nustar _ on - board clock ,",

    "as reported in @xcite , the re - appearance of the accretion disk in psr j1023 + 0038 was accompanied by a @xmath23.5 magnitude increase in uv brightness and a @xmath220-fold rise in x - ray luminosity .",
    "similarly , in the state transition of xss j122704859 @xcite , the transformation from an accreting state to a radio pulsar state was signaled by a decrease in x - ray luminosity by a factor of @xmath210 and decline in uv and optical brightness by @xmath23 and @xmath22 magnitudes , respectively .",
    "for psr j1023 + 0038 , the return of the accretion disk also coincided with a factor of @xmath25 enhancement in high - energy @xmath1-ray luminosity as seen by _ fermi _ lat @xcite .",

    "the catalina real - time transient survey ( crts * ? ? ?",
    "* ) acquires unfiltered exposures of the sky away from the galactic plane that usually reach equivalent @xmath22 filter of @xmath21920 .",
    "the crts archive includes 324 observations of 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820  spanning from late 2005 to late 2013 . removing points with magnitude errors greater than 0.2 results in 260 individual exposures .",

    "the _ swift _ uvot data include four exposures with the uvw1 , two with the uvw1 , three with the um2 , and three with the u filter .",
    "the photometric measurements and associated uncertainties were extracted with the uvotsource task in ftools , using a source extraction region of radius 5@xmath23 centered on the optical position given in @xcite .",

    "the 0.310 kev light curves were extracted using the xrtpipeline command in ftools .",
    "the counts were grouped adaptively to ensure that each time bin contained at least 20 counts .      to investigate the high - energy @xmath1-ray variability of 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820  on long timescales ,",
    "i have retrieved all pass 8 _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) data within @xmath24 of the source from the start of the mission on 2008 august 4 through 2015 june 7 .",
    "the @xmath1-ray light curve was obtained by dividing the data set in 60 day intervals and carrying out a binned likelihood analysis for each time segment using the fermi science tools v10r0p5 .",
    "following the analysis procedures recommended by the fermi science support center , i first generated counts , exposure , and source maps , livetime cube , and an input source model based on the source information provided in the 3fgl catalog @xcite . in the likelihood fitting with the gtlike task , the contribution from all sources within @xmath24 of 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820 , as well as from the galactic and extragalactic diffuse emission ,",

    "the best fit values and uncertainties of the flux of 3fgl j1544.61125 were used to construct a light curve in the 0.1100 gev band .",
    "although the optical , uv and x - ray data have gaps in coverage spanning several months to years , when combined with the @xmath1-ray data , they provide useful constraints on the long - term behavior of 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820  within the past decade .",
    "for instance , it is apparent that there have been no intervals spanning months to years in which the system has been in a low - flux , non - accreting state .",
    "the _ fermi _ lat 0.1100 gev light curve shows no appreciable deviations from the mean photon flux of @xmath25 @xmath7 s@xmath11 .",
    "this is consistent with variability index of 47.5 reported for 3fgl j1544.61125 in the _ fermi _ lat 4-year catalog @xcite , which indicates no statistically significant flux changes over the course of the mission .    on the other hand ,",
    "the crts and the most recent _ swift _ uvot uvw1 data show instances of enhancement in brightness by @xmath2@xmath26 magnitudes compared to the typical value .",
    "these events may correspond to occasional flaring episodes seen from psr j1023 + 0038 @xcite and xss j122704859 @xcite in the optical , uv , and x - rays .",
    "the _ swift _ xrt 0.310 kev exposures exhibit large - amplitude variations that span a factor of @xmath210 in count rate .",
    "the corresponding range of fluxes are in good agreement with the high and low mode levels observed with _",
    "xmm - newton _ @xcite .",
    "the hard x - ray properties of the 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820  system as revealed by _ nustar _ are virtually identical to those of the confirmed transitional msps .",
    "for example , @xcite investigated the broad - band x - ray properties of xss j122704859 during its accreting state using data from _ xmm - newton _ , _ rxte _ , and _",
    "integral_. the source spectrum in the 0.1100 kev can be fitted by a single power - law with index @xmath27 . in the _ rxte _ data ,",
    "xss j122704859 showed the same mode switching and flaring behavior found in soft x - rays .",
    "@xcite presented _ nustar _ observations of psr j1023 + 0038 in both the radio pulsar and accreting x - ray binary states .",
    "the average hard x - ray emission in the more luminous accreting state is well - described a power - law with photon index @xmath28 with a luminosity of @xmath29 erg s@xmath11 ( 379 kev ) .",
    "rapid variability between two clearly separated flux levels was also found .",
    "the available optical / uv , soft and hard x - ray and high - energy @xmath1-ray data for 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820  allows an examination of the broad - band emission spectrum of the system .",
    "figure 4 shows the optical to gev @xmath1-ray range for 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820 . for an illustrative comparison , the multi - wavelength data set of psr j1023 + 0038 in its accreting state",
    "is also shown .",
    "the overall similarities in the shape of the broadband spectral energy distributions offers an additional indicator that 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820  belongs to the same class of objects as psr j1023 + 0038 , xss j122704859 , and psr j18242452i . in light of this ,",
    "the same interpretations used for these objects can be invoked to explain the different emission components of 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820 .",
    "the optical flux is likely a combination of emission from the companion and the accretion disk , with the latter dominating the emission in the uv .",
    "the x - ray emission presumably originates in the inner disk , close to or at the surface of the neutron star .",
    "the detection of coherent x - ray pulsations during the high mode x - ray emission in psr j1023 + 0038 @xcite and xss j122704859 ( papitto et al .",
    "2015 ) and the absence of radio pulsations @xcite suggests that at least during these intervals active accretion onto the stellar surface is taking place and the radio pulsar mechanism is quenched .",
    "the cause of the aperiodic rapid drops to a low flux mode is less clear as it may correspond to changes to a propeller ejection process @xcite or a dead / trapped disk regime @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is not clear whether the inflow of matter is via a `` classical '' thin disk or a radiatively inefficient accretion flow @xcite .",
    "the persistent @xmath1-rays from this system possibly arise due up - scattering of x - rays at the boundary between the accretion flow and the neutron star magnetosphere .",
    "two general varieties of models have been put forth to explain the observed @xmath1-rays , which differ principally in the assumption of an active or inactive rotation - powered pulsar wind . in the active pulsar wind scenario ,",
    "the x - ray and @xmath1-ray emission arise due to an intrabinary shock produced at the interface of the accretion disk and the pulsar wind @xcite .",
    "the x - rays are generated via synchrotron radiation in the shock , while the @xmath1-rays are the product of inverse compton scattering of the photons emanating from the accretion disk off the pulsar wind particles .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , for the case of an inactive ( `` quenched '' ) pulsar wind , the system is assumed to be in the so - called propeller regime in which most of the inflowing material is expelled by the rapidly rotating pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "the x - ray luminosity is then due to synchrotron plus disk emission , with the flux moding arising from rapid switching between accretion onto the star ( the high mode ) and propeller ejection ( the low mode ) .",
    "the @xmath1-ray emission is produced by synchrotron self - compton emission buy accelerated particles in the turbulent boundary between the pulsar magnetosphere and the accretion disk .    while 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820  appears to be a close analog of the confirmed transitional msps , some notable differences are also apparent . in particular , the @xmath1-ray flux of 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820  is @xmath23 higher that that of psr j1023 + 0038 , whereas the mean x - ray flux is @xmath23 times lower .",
    "while the lower x - ray flux can be attributed to a greater distance ( assuming a comparable intrinsic luminosity ) , the relative differences in x - ray to @xmath1-ray flux may arise either due to higher efficiency of the @xmath1-ray production mechanism or due to a more favorable viewing angle if the radiation pattern is not isotropic .",
    "in addition , for psr j1023 + 0038 , the high and low mode x - ray fluxes differ by a factor of @xmath196 , while for 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820  the flux varies by a factor of @xmath1910 . assuming that during the low x - ray mode , the accretion flow is cleared out of the pulsar magnetosphere , this difference could be ascribed to a larger accretion disk truncation radius in 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820 .",
    "if this radius coincides with the pulsar light cylinder ( @xmath30 ) it implies a more slowly spinning neutron star , although other factors like a less massive neutron star or a different magnetic field configuration may play a role in determining the high / low flux ratio .",
    "i have presented the first hard x - ray observation of the low - luminosity x - ray binary and _ fermi _ lat source , 1rxs j154439.4112820 / 3gl j1544.61125 .",
    "the binary is detected at high significance up to @xmath230 kev with a continuation of the power - law spectrum observed in soft x - rays .",
    "the hard x - rays also exhibit variability on timescales of 10100 seconds by a factor of @xmath1910 in flux as seen in the 0.310 kev range with _ xmm - newton_. the spectral energy distribution of 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820  covering the optical through gev range is qualitatively very similar to that of psr j1023 + 0038 ( as well as xss j122704859 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these findings further strengthen the argument that this system belongs to the same class of objects as psr j1023 + 0038 , xss j122704859 and psr j182424i , namely a compact binary hosting a msp that is presently accreting at low luminosities .",
    "i find no clear evidence in archival data for prolonged low flux intervals at any wavelength implying that within the past @xmath2decade 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820  has most likely not experienced a transformation to a disk - free state . nevertheless , as the strongest transitional msp candidate , 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820  warrants dedicated monitoring to identify behavior that may signal the disappearance of its accretion disk and the activation of the rotation - powered millisecond pulsar .",
