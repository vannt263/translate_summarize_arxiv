    "developing secure systems is difficult and costly . the high cost of effectively mitigating all vulnerabilities and the far lesser cost of exploiting a single one creates an environment which advantages cyber attackers .",
    "new cyber defense paradigms have been proposed to re - balance the landscape and create uncertainty for the attackers @xcite .",
    "one such paradigm is active defense based on temporal platform diversity .",
    "temporal platform diversity ( or simply platform diversity ) techniques dynamically change the properties of a computing platform in order to complicate attacks .",
    "platform properties refer to hardware and operating system ( os ) attributes such as instruction set architecture ( isa ) , stack direction , calling convention , kernel version , os distribution , and machine instance .",
    "various platform diversity techniques have been proposed in the literature .",
    "emulation - based techniques change the calling sequence and instruction set presented to an application @xcite ; multivariant execution techniques change properties such as stack direction or machine description using compiler generated diversity and virtualization @xcite ; migration - based techniques change the hardware and operating system of an application using containers and compiler - based checkpointing @xcite ; server diversification techniques rotate a server across multiple platforms and software stacks using network proxies @xcite ; self cleansing techniques change the machine instance by continuously rotating across many virtual machines and re - imaging the inactive ones @xcite . the key point to these techniques",
    "is that platform diversity does not remove vulnerabilities , it just makes them more complicated to exploit .    unfortunately little",
    "work has been done on understanding and quantifying the impact of temporal platform diversity on the security of a system .",
    "the following important questions often remained unanswered : how often should the platform change ?",
    "how diverse are various platforms ?",
    "what is the quantitative impact of platform diversity on attacks ?",
    "what are the important parameters and factors for the effectiveness of a platform diversity system ? should the next platform or platform configuration be selected uniformly or preferentially ? what is the optimal strategy for controlling a platform diversity system ?    in this work , we take various approaches to quantitatively analyze and study active cyber defenses based on platform diversity .",
    "we use a migration - based technique ( i.e.  talent @xcite ) in our study and quantitatively measure its properties using four approaches .",
    "first , we perform an abstract analysis of platform diversity using algebraic models , combinatorics , and markov models .",
    "second , we implement the platform diversity system on a testbed and perform experiments with it using real exploits to quantitatively measure its properties .",
    "third , we analyze the temporal migration patterns using game theory and derive an optimal strategy for selecting the next platform for five operating systems : centos , freebsd , debian , fedora , and gentoo .",
    "fourth , we model the platform diversity system running the above operating systems with and without the optimal strategy and simulate its impact on an attacker trying to compromise the system .    the quantitative results from our four approaches are consistent and in some cases surprising and counter - intuitive .",
    "our findings indicate that although platform diversity can help protect a system against some attacks ( specifically , persistent service disruption attacks ) , it can negatively impact security for others ( specifically , fast , single compromise attacks ) .",
    "we show that the benefit of platform diversity techniques heavily depends on their threat models and that operational requirements and temporal parameters must be understood and fine tuned for these techniques to be effective .",
    "moreover , we prove that preferential selection of platforms can achieve better protection and derive the optimal strategy for determining temporal patterns ( i.e.  the next platform ) .",

    "in this section , we briefly describe the active defense techniques based on platform diversity .",
    "we provide enough background for understanding the rest of the paper .",
    "more details about each technique can be found in its original publication .",
    "temporal platform diversity techniques change platform properties in order to make attacks more complicated .",
    "they often rely on temporal changes ( e.g.  vm rotation ) , diversity ( e.g.  multivariant execution ) , or both ( e.g.  migration - based techniques ) to protect a system .",
    "these techniques are often implemented using machine - level or operating system - level virtualization , compiler - based code diversification , emulation layers , checkpoint / restore techniques , or a combination thereof .",
    "emulation - based techniques such as genesis @xcite often use an application - level virtual machines such as strata @xcite or valgrind @xcite to implement instruction set diversity . in some cases ,",
    "multiple instances are executed and a monitor compares their results .",
    "multivariant execution techniques such as reverse stack @xcite ( also called n - variant systems @xcite ) use compiler - based techniques to create diverse application code by replacing sets of instructions with semantically equivalent ones .",
    "migration - based techniques such as talent @xcite use operating system - level virtualization ( containers ) to move an application across diverse architectures and operating systems .",
    "platform diversity can also be achieved at a higher abstraction level by switching between different implementations of servers @xcite .",
    "these techniques either do not preserve the state ( e.g.  a web server ) or they preserve it using high level configuration files ( e.g.  dns server ) . finally , self - cleansing techniques such as scit @xcite only change the current instance of the platform without diversifying it . the main goal , in this case , is bringing the platform to its pristine state and removing persistence of attacks .    in this work , we use a migration - based platform diversity technique , talent , in our analyses . since talent provides both temporal changes ( periodic migrations ) and diversity ( multiple operating systems ) , it is a good candidate for capturing the major effects and dynamics in our quantitative analysis .      rusted dynmic ogical hterogeeity sysem ( talent ) @xcite is a framework for live - migrating critical applications across heterogeneous platforms .",
    "talent has several design goals : i ) heterogeneity at the instruction set architecture level , ii ) heterogeneity at the operating system level , iii ) preservation of the state of the application , including the execution state , open files and sockets , and iv ) working with a general - purpose , system language such as c. talent uses two key concepts , operating - system - level virtualization and portable checkpoint compilation , to address the challenges involved in using heterogeneous platforms , including binary incompatibility and the loss of state and environment .",
    "the environment of an application refers to the filesystem , configuration files , open files , network connections , and open devices .",
    "many of the environment parameters can be preserved using virtual machine migration .",
    "however , virtual machine migration can only be accomplished using a homogeneous operating system and hardware .",
    "talent uses operating - system - level virtualization to sandbox an application and migrate the environment . in operating - system - level virtualization",
    ", the kernel allows for multiple isolated user - level instances .",
    "each instance is called a container ( jail or virtual environment )",
    ". this type of virtualization can be thought of as an extended ` chroot ` in which all resources ( devices , filesystem , memory , sockets , etc . )",
    "are virtualized .",
    "hence , the semantic information that is often lost in hardware virtualization is readily available in operating - system - level virtualization .",
    "talent is implemented using the openvz @xcite .",
    "when migration is requested , talent migrates the container of the application from the source machine to the destination machine .",
    "this is done by synchronizing the filesystem of the containers , migrating the ip address of the source container s virtual network interface , and transferring the state of each tcp socket ( ` sk_buff ` structure of the kernel ) .",
    "ipc and signal migration is supported in talent through the underlying virtualization layer .",
    "migrating the environment is only one step in backing up the system because the state of running programs must also be migrated . to do this , a method to checkpoint running applications",
    "must be implemented .",
    "talent uses a portable checkpoint compiler ( cppc @xcite ) to migrate a process state .",
    "cppc allows talent to checkpoint the state of the binary on one architecture and recover the state on a different architecture . to perform checkpointing ,",
    "the code is precompiled to find restart - relevant variables .",
    "these variables and their memory locations are then registered in the checkpointing tool .",
    "when checkpointing , the process is paused and the values of the memory locations are dumped into a file .",
    "the checkpointing operation must occur at safe points in the code to generate a consistent view . at restart",
    ", the memory of the destination process is populated with the desired variable values from the checkpoint file .",
    "some portions of the code are re - executed in order to construct the entire state .",
    "the checkpoint file itself must have a portable format to achieve portability across 32-bit/64-bit architectures and little / big endian machines .",
    "talent uses the hdf5 portable file format @xcite for its checkpoints .",
    "talent has been implemented on intel xeon 32-bit , intel core 2 quad 64-bit , and amd opteron 64-bit processors .",
    "it has also been tested with gentoo , fedora ( 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , and 17 ) , centos ( 4 , 5 , and 6.3 ) , debian ( 4 , 5 , and 6 ) , ubuntu ( 8 and 9 ) , suse ( 10 and 11 ) , and freebsd 9 operating systems .",
    "we discuss multiple threat models in this paper but analysis shows that they share common features . to make the analysis more precise , we explicitly describe the core threat model in this section .",
    "variations upon the core threat model are described in the other sections as appropriate .    in our model",
    ", the defender has a number of different platforms to run a critical application .",
    "the attacker has a set of exploits ( attacks ) that are applicable against some of these platforms , but not the others .",
    "we call the platforms for which the attacker has an exploit `` vulnerable '' and the others `` invulnerable . '' in a strict systems security terminology , vulnerable does not imply exploitable ; without loss of generality , we only consider exploitable vulnerabilities .",
    "an alternative interpretation of this threat model is that the vulnerabilities are exploitable on some platforms , but not on the other ones .",
    "the defender does not know which platforms are vulnerable and which are invulnerable , nor does he have detection capabilities for the deployed exploits .",
    "this scenario , for example , describes the use of zero - day exploits by attackers , for which no detection mechanism exists by definition .",
    "since there is little attempt to isolate the inactive platforms in platform diversity systems , we assume that all platforms are accessible by the attacker , and the attacker attempts to exploit each one . moreover , we assume that the defender does not have a recovery or re - imaging capability to restore a compromised platform .",
    "the reason for this assumption is two fold : first , typical recovery methods ( e.g.  clean installation of the operating system ) can take a long time to complete and unless the defender has many spare platforms , it is hard to accomplish it effectively .",
    "a large number of spare platforms also implies large hardware cost for these systems ( e.g.  scit @xcite ) .",
    "second , and more importantly , the goal of this paper is to study the impact of temporal platform changes , not the effectiveness of recovery capabilities being used .",
    "hence , once exploited , a platform remains vulnerable and the attacker requires no staging time in the future .    the attacker s goal is what creates the variations in our threat model .",
    "for example , one success criteria may be for the adversary to compromise the system for a given period of time to cause irreversible damage ( e.g.  crash a satellite ) , while a different success criteria gives the attacker gradual gain the longer the system is compromised ( e.g.  exfiltration of information ) . these variations and their impact on the effectiveness of temporal platform diversity",
    "are discussed in the subsequent sections .",
    "much of the analysis of one system using temporal platform diversity as a security strategy applies to any such system . in this section",
    "we will specify an abstraction that generically describes temporal platform diversity , which is useful as a security strategy in protecting against attacks that have a temporal requirement .",
    "we analyze a number of cases where this holds . to better convey the meanings , we use simple phrases which are examples of these cases to refer to them : crash the satellite , sneaking past a sensor , and exfiltration over a difficult channel .    1 .",
    "crash the satellite - once the attacker has controlled the system continuously for a specified time period , the game is over and the attacker has won .",
    "2 .   sneaking past a sensor - the attacker needs control for a specified time period for an attack to succeed .",
    "once the attacker has control for the period , the attacker s payoff function starts to increase from zero .",
    "the scenario can either be continuous or finite duration .",
    "3 .   exfiltration over a difficult channel - the attacker needs control for a specified time period for an attack to succeed .",
    "once the attacker has control for the period , the attackers payoff function starts to increase from a positive value .",
    "we can categorize the problem space according to a number of properties :    * the attackers temporal requirement can either be aggregate or continuous , * the attackers payoff can be either fractional or binary ( all or nothing ) , * the period of usage ( equivalently attack window ) can either be of fixed duration or ongoing , and * the migration models include random with repeat , random without repeat , and periodic permutation    we will define the abstract model of a temporal platform diversity system @xmath0 as a system that migrates through a finite fixed collection of states @xmath1 .",
    "each state either has or does not have a property exploitable by the attacker which we call vulnerable . in the first approximation to the model we assume that the states are fully independent .",
    "we will use the notation presented in table [ table : notation ] .",
    ".notation describing platform diversity system [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ fig : percentage - vulnerable ] we plot the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the fraction of time the selected platform was vulnerable , computed across all 500 mc trials . in this plot , a curve trending towards the upper - right corner is preferred , as it demonstrates that a vulnerable system was presented less often .",
    "we see that optimizing diversity generally selects less vulnerable systems than either of the other methods ; the mean rate of vulnerability for the three methods is shown in table [ tab : mean - vulnerability - rate ] . while diversity does show statistically significant improvement over other strategies , the conclusion from this evaluation would be that none of the strategies are particularly viable .",
    "indeed , in section [ aa ] we determined that @xmath2 was the optimal number of platforms to use , yet its performance is nearly identical to leveraging more . as discussed earlier , however , this is a flawed metric that does nt represent this attacker model .",
    "we now demonstrate the cdfs of the two metrics which are appropriate for evaluating the given threat models in fig .",
    "[ fig : evaluation - metrics - sim ] .",
    "first , we study the case for which a single compromise is considered success for the adversary and failure for the defender ( e.g.  ` crash the satellite ' ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : time - to - first ] , we plot the cdf for the time it takes before the system is fully compromised , that is , @xmath2 vulnerable platforms are presented consecutively . noting that these results are from the same trials as fig .",
    "[ fig : percentage - vulnerable ] , we see a significant difference in performance with the appropriate metric . optimizing for diversity results in system compromise only 2% of the time , while uniform selection eventually results in system compromise in 79% of the trials .",
    "we note that because the diversity optimization strategy results in periodic scheduling , if system compromise is going to happen , it does so nearly instantaneously  either at @xmath3 or shortly thereafter ( once the deterministic solution is reached ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the system can only be compromised if all of the platforms in the resultant solution are vulnerable ; nothing changes after the solution is reached .",
    "the same can be said about the random 3 strategy , but we note that performance is significantly reduced due to the increased probability of drawing 3 platforms that are highly similar .",
    "contrarily , the uniform strategy will almost surely result in system compromise as @xmath4 if there exists @xmath2 vulnerable platforms in the fully available set .",
    "finally , we study the threat model for which an adversary achieves progressive gains the longer they are present on the system ( e.g.  ` exfiltration over a difficult channel ' and sneak past a sensor ) .",
    "recall that in these scenarios , the defender loss begins  or continues  after the adversary is present for @xmath2 consecutive intervals . as such",
    ", an appropriate evaluation metric is the fraction of time that the system is in a compromised state , which we plot the cdf for in fig .",
    "[ fig : percentage - compromised ] . once again , optimizing diversity yields far superior performance to other methods . in 98% of the trials ,",
    "the system was never compromised ( note this matches fig .",
    "[ fig : time - to - first ] ) , while in that other 2% it was compromised for the entire duration .",
    "meanwhile , uniform migration results in system compromise on average 26% of the time , and only in less than 2% of the trials did it result in less compromise than diversity optimization ( 13% of trials when comparing to random 3 ) .",
    "one can see that when evaluating with the appropriate metrics , the difference in performance becomes significant .",
    "this is important to take note of and emphasizes the need to develop a deployment strategy that is optimal towards the specific threat model of interest .",
    "given the threat model requiring adversary persistence , deterministically optimizing for diversity shows superior performance to attempting to achieve security through randomization .",
    "we note that while the effects discovered in these simulations match the theoretical results presented in section [ aa ] as well as in the experimental results in section [ ss : experimentalresults ] .",
    "our work in analyzing and testing temporal moving target technologies has provided three main lessons .",
    "the first is that the methodology of producing threat derived metrics , as in @xcite , can be extended to evaluate base technologies . in the cases ,",
    "technologies are designed to address a specific problem or set of problem . as such security technologies implicitly carry the set of threats which they are intended to address .",
    "these threats can be used to derive metrics .    while the threats addressed by temporal moving target technologies vary , there remains a certain similarity in the produced metrics and , perhaps more importantly , in the data needed to evaluate them .",
    "this allows the transformation of data gathered from one set of , potentially expensive or time consuming , tests in a specific usage scenario to different usage scenarios .",
    "the second is the surprising result that security , as measured using the threat derived metrics , is not a strictly increasing as a function of diversity .",
    "indeed , the minimal diversity required to cover the attackers required duration provides the optimal solution in the continuous requirement case . in the aggregate case ,",
    "the optimal diversity is determined via a process similar to gerrymandering : that is that the attacker just barely loses in the majority of sub - selections .",
    "the final lesson is that when we have information concerning diversity between individual platforms , the optimal result is provided by maximizing platform dissimilarity while minimizing the diversity in the sense of platform count . indeed ,",
    "even given knowledge of the probability of vulnerability in the various platforms , the most secure ensemble might not be comprised of the most secure individual members .",
    "various platform diversity techniques have been proposed in the literature . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the self - cleansing intrusion tolerance ( scit ) project rotates virtual machines to reduce the exposure time .",
    "scit - web server @xcite and scit - dns @xcite preserve the session information and dns master file and keys , respectively , but not the internal state of the application . the resilient web service ( rws ) project @xcite uses a virtualization - based web server system that detects intrusions and periodically restores them to a pristine state .",
    "certain forms of server rotation have been proposed by blackmon and nguyen @xcite and by rabbat , et al .",
    "@xcite in an attempt to achieve high availability servers .",
    "high - level forms of temporal platform changes have been proposed by petkac and badger @xcite and min and choic @xcite to build intrusion tolerant systems although the diversification strategy is not as detailed in these efforts .",
    "compiler - based multivariant @xcite and n - variant systems @xcite propose another way of achieving platform diversity .",
    "holland , et al propose diversifying machine descriptions using a virtualization layer @xcite .",
    "a similar approach with more specific diversification strategy based on instruction sets and calling sequences has been proposed by williams et al @xcite .",
    "wong and lee @xcite use randomization in the processor to combat side - channel attacks on caches .    on the evaluation side , manadhata and wind @xcite",
    "propose a formal model for measuring a system s attack surface that can be used to compare different platforms .",
    "evans et al @xcite develop models to measure the effectiveness of diversity - based moving target technique .",
    "they evaluate the probability of attack success given the time duration of attack probing , construction , and launch cycles and the entropy of randomness in the target system .",
    "they evaluate the impact of various attacks on moving target systems including circumvention , deputy , brute force , entropy reduction , probing , and incremental attacks .",
    "colbaugh and glass use game theory to analyze strategies for deploying moving target defenses against adaptive adversaries , concluding with the result that uniform randomization is optimal .",
    "while these results may seem counter to our own , they are not .",
    "their threat model did not require adversary persistence and the defense strategy was designed to minimize predictability .",
    "specifically , the more an adversary is able to observe a defense , they are more likely to adapt to it . in the case of temporal platform migration , this implies that the adversary will expend resources towards the development of exploits specific to the systems observed .",
    "while their adversary starts with no capabilities and develops them over time , we instead assume the adversary already has access to a full suite of exploits .",
    "one can view these analyses as complimentary , where applies to the attacker / defender evolution , while the work we present here applies to the steady state .",
    "in this paper , we have quantitatively studied cyber defenses based on temporal platform diversity .",
    "although the experiments were focused on a migration - based platform diversity system , much of the analyses apply to any such system .",
    "our abstract analysis has studied the major properties in a platform diversity system including the temporal effects , the payoff models , and the window of opportunity using combinatorics and markov models .",
    "additionally , the impact of finite duration and fractional effects has been studied .",
    "the experiments have collected data from a testbed implementation of such a system in which all of the abstract effects can be observed .",
    "the game theoretic analysis has studied the impact of preferential platform selection on the effectiveness of such systems and derived an optimal operational strategy . finally , by simulating the model of the system",
    ", we evaluate the impact of different strategies on the effectiveness of temporal platform diversity .",
    "our results suggest that while platform diversity is useful for mitigating some attacks , it is of critical importance to understand the threat model one aims to defend against .",
    "designing and deploying defensive techniques that have not considered the threat model may result in the illusion of security , when one may actually be increasing their attack surface .",
    "moreover , coupling a platform diversity system with a control mechanism that uses optimal strategies can significantly improve its effectiveness .",
    "no one technology will defend against all attacks , so understanding the proper operation and strengths of a platform diversity system enables network defenders ensure that other techniques are deployed for areas of weakness .",
    "the future work in this domain will focus on performing more experiments with such systems , extending the analysis to other platform diversity techniques and other randomization and diversity approaches , and analyzing the second order behavior such as adaptive adversaries who change tactics based on the deployed defenses .",
    "special thanks to mark rabe of mit lincoln laboratory for his help in setting up the experimental test bed .",
    "let @xmath5 be the expected length of a sequence beginning with a vulnerable state that requires @xmath6 consecutive vulnerable states to fail .",
    "let @xmath7 be the equivalent construct for sequences beginning with an invulnerable state .",
    "then the mean time until attacker victory is @xmath8 . due to the markov property",
    "we know that @xmath9 . also due to the markov property , @xmath10 we can compute the expected lengths of the sequence @xmath11 as          d.  arsenault , a.  sood , and y.  huang .",
