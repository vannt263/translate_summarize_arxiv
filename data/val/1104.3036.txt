    "four decades ago dyakonov and perel showed that a system with strong spin - orbit interaction should reveal transverse spin current and spin accumulation in the presence of external longitudinal electric field  @xcite  even if the system is nonmagnetic .",
    "this effect , known now as the spin hall effect ( she )  @xcite , was studied extensively in the last few years  @xcite , and is still of current interest  mainly because it offers a new possibility of spin manipulation with electric field only .",
    "the possibility of pure electrical manipulation of spin degrees of freedom is interesting not only from fundamental reasons , but also from the point of view of possible applications in future spintronics devices and information processing technologies  @xcite .",
    "the crucial interaction responsible for she , i.e. the spin - orbit coupling , may be either of intrinsic ( internal ) or extrinsic origin .",
    "the corresponding extrinsic she is associated with mechanisms of spin - orbit scattering on impurities and other defects ( skew scattering and/or side jump ) , while the intrinsic she is a consequence of a nontrivial trajectory of charge carriers in the momentum space due to the spin - orbit contribution of a perfect crystal lattice to the corresponding band structure .",
    "the intrinsic she may be described in terms of the berry phase formalism  @xcite and therefore it is also referred to as the topological she .",
    "it is well known that various spin effects , like for instance spin current and spin accumulation , may be generated not only by external electric field , but also due to a temperature gradient .",
    "indeed , there is a great interest currently in spin related thermoelectric effects .",
    "one of such phenomena is the spin seebeck effect , where longitudinal spin current and spin voltage are generated by a temperature gradient  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest , however , are spin thermoelectric effects in systems with spin - orbit interaction , where a temperature gradient gives rise to transverse spin accumulation and/or spin currents .",
    "thus , the temperature gradient in such systems may lead to anomalous ( in case of ferromagnetic systems ) and spin nernst effects  @xcite , which correspond to the anomalous and spin hall effects induced by longitudinal electric field .",
    "similarity of the spin hall and spin nernst effects in nonmagnetic systems with spin - orbit interaction is presented in fig.1 , which clearly shows that the she is generated by external electric field , while the spin nernst effect ( sne ) is a similar effect generated by a temperature gradient instead of electric field ( gradient of electrostatic potential ) .        in this paper",
    "we consider the topological contribution to the spin hall and spin nernst effects in a bilayer graphene .",
    "graphene is a two - dimensional crystal of carbon atoms .",
    "a monolayer graphene in a free standing form was obtained few years ago and owing to its unusual and peculiar properties quickly became one of the most extensively studied materials  @xcite .",
    "after the pioneering paper by kane and mele  @xcite , spin hall effect in a monolayer graphene was studied in many papers and in various physical situations .",
    "recently , bilayer graphene is extensively studied as a more appropriate for applications than a single - layer one . moreover",
    ", it has been shown that spin - orbit coupling in a bilayer can be enhanced in comparison to that in a single - layer graphene  @xcite .",
    "this motivated us to consider topological contributions to the she and sne in a bilayer graphene .",
    "both she and sne in ( nonmagnetic ) graphene are generated by spin - orbit interaction . in general , one can distinguish two different forms of the spin - orbit interaction having the crystal lattice periodicity and contributing to the relevant band structure  internal and rashba spin - orbit interactions .",
    "the latter interaction is due to a substrate and can be controlled by an external gate voltage . in this paper",
    "we consider the contributions to she and sne due to the intrinsic spin - orbit interaction only .",
    "it is known that this interaction opens an energy gap at the dirac points .",
    "it was also shown that the energy gap can be tuned externally by applying a voltage bias between the layers  @xcite .",
    "the gate voltage dependence of the spin hall conductivity , leading to phase transition between the spin hall insulator and classical insulator will also be considered in this paper .",
    "the description of transport properties of graphene is usually based on some effective hamiltonian , which properly describes electronic spectrum near the fermi level of a neutral system .",
    "however , it is well known that the topological contribution to the spin hall effect includes contributions from electronic states far below the fermi level , and therefore a more accurate electronic spectrum is required to describe the effect properly .",
    "accordingly , in this paper we calculate the spin hall and spin nernst conductivities from a more realistic electronic spectrum based on a tight binding hamiltonian , and compare them with the corresponding conductivities obtained on the basis of effective hamiltonians .",
    "the results presented in this paper reveal , however , a very good agreement between the conductivities derived from the effective and tight binding hamiltonians .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe briefly the electronic states of a bilayer graphene within the tight binding hamiltonian and also in terms of an effective hamiltonian , which is sufficient for states in the vicinity of the fermi level of a neutral graphene . in both cases the intrinsic spin - orbit interaction and the effect of a normal bias voltage are taken into account . in section 3",
    "we calculate the spin hall and spin nernst conductivities for the tight binding hamiltonian and compare them with those obtained from the effective hamiltonian . in the latter case",
    "we derive analytical formulas for the spin hall and spin nernst conductivities .",
    "we also discuss the role of normal bias ( in the framework of the effective model ) .",
    "description based on a reduced low - energy effective hamiltonian is presented in section 4 .",
    "summary and final conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "a single - layer graphene is a monolayer of carbon atoms arranged in a two - dimensional honeycomb lattice which can be also considered as being composed of two nonequivalent triangular sublattices . in the absence of spin - orbit interaction the fermi surface of a neutral single - layer graphene",
    "consists of two nonequivalent @xmath0 and @xmath1 points of the brillouin zone , at which the valence and conduction bands touch each other .",
    "the corresponding electronic spectrum can be described by a tight binding hamiltonian with nearest and next - nearest neighbor hopping terms .",
    "the low energy electron states near the points @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be well approximated by a conical energy spectrum ( linear dispersion relations ) . as a result ,",
    "charge carriers in the vicinity of the points @xmath0 and @xmath1 are described effectively by the relativistic dirac equation.@xcite intrinsic spin - orbit interaction opens then an energy gap at the dirac points .",
    "the tight binding and effective hamiltonians for a bilayer graphene are more complex , as described below .",
    "the bilayer graphene in the bernal stacking ( see _ eg _ [ ] ) is described by the following tight binding hamiltonian : @xmath2 where @xmath3 @xmath4 the matrix elements @xmath5 and @xmath6 are defined as follows : @xmath7 $ ] and @xmath8 $ ] , where @xmath9 is the hopping integral between the nearest neighbors in the atomic sheets , @xmath10 is the next - nearest neighbor spin - orbit hopping amplitude , while @xmath11 with @xmath12 being the lattice parameter .",

    "the differences can be seen on a smaller energy scale , as in the parts ( d ) and ( e ) of fig.2 . when comparing figs 2(b ) and 2(d )",
    ", one can notice a larger energy gap for @xmath25 .",
    "this is more clearly seen when comparing the parts ( c ) and ( e ) .",
    "first , for the assumed value of @xmath13 the gap is wider than for @xmath21 .",
    "second , the top and bottom band edges become split and shifted away from the dirac points .",
    "as will be described later , the applied voltage between the atomic sheets first closes the gap and then opens a new one with the width increasing with @xmath13 .",
    "when only electronic states near the fermi level ( near the dirac points ) of a neutral graphene are relevant , one can make use of some effective hamiltonians to describe the corresponding electronic spectrum .",
    "such a hamiltonian can be derived using the @xmath34 approximation . as a result",
    ", the effective hamiltonian for states near the @xmath0 point of the bilayer graphene takes the form  @xcite :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 the first term on the right side corresponds to two decoupled atomic monolayers , each of them being described by the kane hamiltonian for a single layer graphene , @xmath37 . in turn",

    "as before , spectra from tight - binding and effective models coincide near the k point .",
    "note , the band splitting due to @xmath13 is well resolved only in part ( e ) .",
    "separation of the bands @xmath52 and @xmath53 in the effective model described above , as well as in the tight binding model , is much larger than the separation of the bands @xmath54 and @xmath55 , see fig.2 .",
    "therefore , when the electronic states close to the band edges are relevant and sufficient to describe transport properties ( eg .",
    "when the fermi level is in the gap ) , one may restrict considerations to the bands @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "this leads to a further simplification of the effective hamiltonian , as described in more details in section 4 .",
    "spin hall and spin nernst effects correspond to transversal spin currents induced by electric field and temperature gradient , respectively . by analogy to the usual hall and nernst effects one may write the density of spin current due to electric field @xmath56 and temperature gradient @xmath57 as @xmath58\\ ] ] where @xmath59 ( for @xmath60 ) is the spin hall conductivity with @xmath61 being the @xmath62-th component ( @xmath63 ) of electron spin , while @xmath64 denotes the thermoelectric spin nernst conductivity .",

    "this correction gives rise to some contributions to the charge and spin currents  @xcite , and also allows to write the relationship between intrinsic spin nernst conductivity and intrinsic zero - temperature spin hall conductivity , which in the low - temperature regime takes the form  @xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 stands for temperature and @xmath75 denotes the boltzman constant .",
    "the latter equation is the spin analog of the mott relation for charge transport , and will be used to calculate the low - temperature spin nernst conductivity from the zero - temperature spin hall conductivity .",
    "the derivative in eq.(21 ) is taken at the fermi level @xmath76 .",

    "<S> we consider intrinsic contributions to the spin hall and spin nernst effects in a bilayer graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant electronic spectrum is obtained from the tight binding hamiltonian , which also includes the intrinsic spin - orbit interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding spin hall and spin nernst conductivities are compared with those obtained from effective hamiltonians appropriate for states in the vicinity of the fermi level of a neutral bilayer graphene . </S>",
    "<S> both conductivities are determined within the linear response theory and green function formalism . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of an external voltage between the two atomic sheets is also included . </S>",
    "<S> we found transition from the topological spin hall insulator phase at low voltages to conventional insulator phase at larger voltages . </S>"
