    "the important problem of evolution of entanglement in realistic quantum systems interacting with their environments was mainly discussed in the case of two two - level systems ( qubits ) . in that case , the interesting idea that dissipation can create rather then destroy entanglement was studied in details . in particular , in the case of two - level atoms , the possible production of robust or transient entanglement induced by the process of spontaneous emission was shown @xcite .",
    "much more complex and interesting is the process of creation of entanglement involving multilevel atoms .",
    "in such a case , quantum interference between different radiative transitions can influence the dynamics of the system . for a pair of largely separated three - level atoms the role of such interference in the process of degradation of entanglement",
    "was studied in ref .",
    "when the interatomic distance is comparable to the wavelength of the emitted radiation , the coupling between the atoms via common vacuum gives rise to the collective effects such as collective damping and dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "such effects are well known @xcite , particularly in the case of two - level atoms . in the system of three - level atoms having closely lying excited states",
    ", radiative coupling can produce a new interference effect in the spontaneous emission .",
    "this effect manifests by the cross coupling between radiation transitions with orthogonal dipole moments @xcite .",
    "all such collective properties of the system influence the entanglement between three - level atoms .    in the paper",
    ", we study the entanglement production between three - level atoms due to the collective damping ( a detailed analysis of the entanglement evolution in the presence of all collective effects will be presented elsewhere ) . in that case , the analysis is involved since there is no simple necessary and sufficient condition of entanglement for a pair of @xmath0 - level systems with @xmath1 .",
    "peres - horodecki separability criterion",
    "@xcite only shows that states which are not positive after partial transposition ( nppt states ) are entangled .",
    "but there can exist entangled states which are positive after this operation @xcite ( bound entangled ppt states ) .",
    "the problem of existence of bound entangled ( i.e. non - distillable @xcite ) states can be analyzed in terms of the rank of density matrix of bipartite system and the ranks of its partial traces .",
    "if a state is separable or bound entangled , then its rank must be larger then the ranks of partial traces @xcite . in the paper we focus on the possibility of creation of nppt `` free '' entangled states , so we not discuss these problems . to detect and quantify entanglement we use negativity of partial transposition of density matrix .",
    "as we show , in the limit of small separation between the atoms , the process of the photon exchange between the atoms produces such correlations that the dynamics is not ergodic and there are nontrivial asymptotic stationary states .",
    "we compute the explicit form of the asymptotic state for any initial state and show that some of the asymptotic states are nppt states , even if the initial states were ppt states .",
    "this effect occurs for example for a large class of diagonal i.e. separable initial states .",
    "we give also the example of bound entangled ppt state which evolves into nppt ( i.e. distillable ) asymptotic state .",
    "consider two identical three - level atoms ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) in the @xmath4 configuration .",
    "the atoms have two near - degenerate excited states @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and ground states @xmath7 .",
    "assume that the atoms interact with the common vacuum and that transition dipole moments of atom @xmath2 are parallel to the transition dipole moments of atom @xmath3 .",
    "due to this interaction , the process of spontaneous emission from two excited levels to the ground state take place in each individual atom but a direct transition between excited levels is not possible .",
    "moreover , the coupling between two atoms can be produced by the exchange of the photons .",
    "the evolution of atomic system can be described by the following master equation @xcite @xmath8 where for @xmath9 we have @xmath10 & { \\gamma_{23}}\\,\\left(\\,2{\\sigma_{32}^{\\mu}}{\\rho}{\\sigma_{23}^{\\mu}}-{\\sigma_{23}^{\\mu } } { \\sigma_{32}^{\\mu}}{\\rho}-{\\rho}{\\sigma_{23}^{\\mu}}{\\sigma_{32}^{\\mu}}\\,\\right ) \\label{gena } \\end{split}\\ ] ] and @xmath11 & + 2{\\sigma_{31}^{b}}{\\rho}{\\sigma_{13}^{a}}-{\\sigma_{13}^{a}}{\\sigma_{31}^{b}}{\\rho}-{\\rho}{\\sigma_{13}^{a}}{\\sigma_{31}^{b}}\\,)\\\\[2 mm ] & + i\\,{\\omega_{13}}\\,\\left[\\,{\\sigma_{13}^{a}}{\\sigma_{31}^{b}}+{\\sigma_{13}^{b}}{\\sigma_{31}^{a}},{\\rho}\\,\\right]\\\\[2 mm ] & + { \\gamma_{23}}\\,(\\ , 2{\\sigma_{32}^{a}}{\\rho}{\\sigma_{23}^{b}}-{\\sigma_{23}^{b}}{\\sigma_{32}^{a}}{\\rho}-{\\rho}{\\sigma_{23}^{b}}{\\sigma_{32}^{a}}\\\\[2 mm ] & + 2{\\sigma_{32}^{b}}{\\rho}{\\sigma_{23}^{a}}-{\\sigma_{23}^{a}}{\\sigma_{32}^{b}}{\\rho}-{\\rho}{\\sigma_{23}^{a}}{\\sigma_{32}^{b}}\\,)\\\\[2 mm ] & + i\\,{\\omega_{23}}\\,\\left[\\,{\\sigma_{23}^{a}}{\\sigma_{32}^{b}}+{\\sigma_{23}^{b}}{\\sigma_{32}^{a}},{\\rho}\\,\\right]\\label{genab } \\end{split}\\ ] ] in the equations ( [ gena ] ) and ( [ genab ] ) , @xmath12 is the transition operator from @xmath13 to @xmath14 ( @xmath9 ) and the coefficient @xmath15 represents the single atom spontaneous - decay rate from the state @xmath16 + ( @xmath17 ) to the state @xmath18 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 are related to the coupling between two atoms and are the collective damping and the dipole - dipole interaction potential , respectively . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , in such atomic system there is also possible the radiative process in which atom @xmath2 in the excited state @xmath21 loses its excitation which in turn excites atom @xmath3 to the state @xmath22 .",
    "this cross coupling between two atoms is sensitive to the orientation of the transition dipole moments of atoms , and in the present paper we study the model in which that coupling is absent .",
    "we also assume that the spontaneous - decay rates satisfy @xmath23 the remaining coefficients in equation ( [ genab ] ) can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath17 and @xmath25 is the distance between atoms .",
    "a detailed form of the functions @xmath26 depends on the geometry of the system @xcite , but in general , for @xmath27 @xmath28 and for @xmath29 @xmath30 whereas the functions @xmath31 diverge .",
    "the time evolution of the initial state @xmath32 of the atomic system is given by the semi - group @xmath33 of completely - positive linear mappings acting on density matrices @xcite , generated by @xmath34 .",
    "the properties of this semi - group crucially depend on the distance @xmath25 between two atoms . as can be shown by a direct calculations , when the distance is large ( compared to radiation wavelenght ) , the semi - group @xmath35 is uniquely relaxing with the asymptotic state @xmath36 . on the other hand , when @xmath25 is small , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are large , so we can use the approximation @xmath39 in that case , the semi - group is not uniquely relaxing and asymptotic stationary states are nontrivial and depend on initial conditions .",
    "we do not discuss details of the time evolution of the system , but we focus on the analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of the dynamics of atoms with small separation , when the conditions ( [ gamma ] ) and ( [ approx ] ) are satisfied . the master equation ( [ me ] ) can be used to obtain differential equations for the matrix elements of any state @xmath32 .",
    "we consider matrix elements of @xmath32 with respect to the basis of @xmath40 given by vectors @xmath41 taken in the lexicographic order .",
    "the equations for @xmath42 form a system of linear differential equations which can be solved by elementary methods . using these solutions , after a long calculations",
    ", we obtain the explicit form of the asymptotic state @xmath43 for any initial state @xmath32 with the matrix elements @xmath44 : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 to get some insight into the process of creation of non - trivial asymptotic state @xmath43 , it may be useful to consider the basis of collective states in @xmath48 , given by the doubly excited states @xmath49 the ground state @xmath50 and generalized symmetric and antisymmetric dicke states ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath51\\\\ & { |{a_{kl}}\\rangle}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[\\,{|{k_{a}}\\rangle}\\otimes{|{l_{b}}\\rangle } -{|{l_{a}}\\rangle}\\otimes{|{k_{b}}\\rangle}\\,\\right ] \\end{split } \\label{dicke}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 .",
    "the states ( [ dicke ] ) are entangled , but in contrast to the case of two - level atoms , they are not maximally entangled .",
    "one can also check that the doubly excited states @xmath53 and the symmetric dicke states @xmath54 decay to the ground state @xmath55 , whereas antisymmetric states @xmath56 and @xmath57 decouple from the environment and therefore are stable .",
    "moreover , the state @xmath58 is not stable , but it is asymptotically non - trivial .",
    "notice that the collective states can be used to the direct characterization of the asymptotic behaviour of the system .",
    "in particular , the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 in ( [ roas ] ) are given by the populations in the antisymmetric states @xmath61 and @xmath58 : @xmath62 the remaining parameters can be computed in terms of the coherences between the collective states . since the populations @xmath63 and @xmath64 are stationary",
    ", the states which have the property of trapping the initial populations in @xmath56 or @xmath57 , create the non - trivial asymptotic state @xmath43 with the stationary entanglement . on the other hand ,",
    "the population in the state @xmath58 is not stable , but it can be transformed into @xmath63 and @xmath64 in such a way that the values of the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 are fixed .",
    "the explicit examples of such behaviour of the system will be discussed in next section .",
    "to describe the process of the creation of correlation between two atoms leading to their entanglement , we need the effective measure of mixed - states entanglement . as such a measure one usually takes entanglement of formation @xmath65 @xcite , but in practice it is not known how to compute this measure for pairs of @xmath0 - level systems in the case when @xmath66 . a computable measure of entanglement proposed in @xcite",
    "is based on the trace norm of the partial transposition @xmath67 of the state @xmath32 . from the peres - horodecki criterion of separability @xcite",
    ", it follows that if @xmath67 is not positive , then @xmath32 is not separable and one defines the _ negativity _ of the state @xmath32 as @xmath68 @xmath69 is equal to the absolute value of the sum of negative eigenvalues of @xmath67 and is an entanglement monotone , but it can not detect bound entangled states @xcite . using the measure ( [ neg ] ) , one can check that generalized dicke states are indeed not maximally entangled , since @xmath70    in this section we study negativity of the asymptotic states ( [ roas ] ) . for such initial states , where only the populations in antisymmetric dicke states are non - zero , it is possible to obtain analytic expression for asymptotic negativity . by a direct calculation one shows that @xmath71\\label{diag}\\ ] ] notice that every non - trivial asymptotic state from this class is entangled . on the other hand , asymptotic negativity for initial states with non -zero coherences , can only be studied numerically .",
    "we start with pure states ( [ basis ] ) .",
    "it is obvious that the initial states @xmath72 and @xmath73 decay to the ground state @xmath55 . on the other hand ,",
    "the initial state @xmath74 ( atom a in the excited state and atom b in the ground state ) has the population in the dicke state @xmath56 which is equal to @xmath75 , thus for that state @xmath76 and the asymptotic state is entangled with negativity @xmath77 similarly , the state @xmath78 has the population @xmath75 in the state @xmath57 and also produces asymptotic state with the same value of entanglement .",
    "the same behaviour can be observed for the initial states @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "when two atoms are initially in different excited states i.e. we have the states @xmath81 or @xmath82 , then the initial populations in the states @xmath56 and @xmath57 are equal to zero , but the population in the non - stable state @xmath58 is non - zero and equals @xmath75 . during the evolution this population is transformed into the states @xmath56 and @xmath57 , in such a way that the asymptotic state @xmath43 satisfies @xmath83 and @xmath84 thus the state @xmath43 is also entangled , but its negativity is less then ( [ nas1 ] ) and equals @xmath85 .",
    "interesting examples of pure non - diagonal initial state are given by the following superpositions of states @xmath81 and @xmath74 : @xmath86\\label{superposition}\\ ] ] in that case , the initial populations @xmath87 and @xmath88 are transformed into @xmath89 in that case , the asymptotic states are parametrized by @xmath90 and their negativity can be computed numerically . in fig.1 , we plot the asymptotic negativity as a function of @xmath91 .",
    "this figure shows that for some values of the parameter @xmath91 , the superposition ( [ superposition ] ) can have larger asymptotic negativity then that achieved by the initial state @xmath74 , which has the maximal value of negativity produced by the dynamics for pure diagonal initial states .",
    "for the incoherent mixtures of pure states @xmath81 and @xmath74 i.e. the initial states @xmath92 the dynamics also produces entangled asymptotic states .",
    "one can check that their negativity is given by @xmath93 and observe that ( [ mixedneg ] ) as the function of mixing parameter @xmath94 is convex , so in contrast to the coherent superposition , the asymptotic negativity never exceeds ( [ nas1 ] ) .",
    "analogous properties of negativity can be found for another mixtures of two pure diagonal states ( fig .",
    "2 ) .    to study the asymptotic entanglement produced for general class of mixed diagonal states",
    ", we consider two parameters to describe asymptotic states : their negativity and degree of mixture given by the linear entropy @xmath95 as we show numerically , the set of all asymptotic states corresponding to the diagonal initial states is represented on the entropy - negativity plane by the region @xmath96 bounded by three curves ( fig .",
    "3 ) .    the boundary curves can be found analytically and are given by the following equations : the solid line on fig .",
    "3 is described by @xmath97 for @xmath98 $ ] , the dotted line is given by @xmath99 for @xmath100 $ ] , and finally , the dashed line is described by equations @xmath101 where @xmath102 $ ] .",
    "every asymptotic state corresponding to diagonal initial state is given by some point from the set @xmath96 .",
    "in particular , on the curve ( [ k1 ] ) lie asymptotic states produced from the mixtures of the state @xmath72 and @xmath81 .",
    "asymptotic states corresponding to the mixtures of @xmath72 and @xmath74 lie on the curve ( [ k2 ] ) , whereas on the curve ( [ k3 ] ) lie asymptotic states obtained from the mixtures of states @xmath81 and @xmath74 .",
    "an example of the state lying inside the set @xmath96 is given by the asymptotic state generated from the initial state @xmath103 which is maximally mixed state of two qutrits .",
    "one can check that the asymptotic state is given by the formula ( [ roas ] ) with @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the corresponding values of linear entropy and negativity are equal to @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively .",
    "as we see , even in that case , the incoherent process of spontaneous emission produces such correlations which entangle two atoms and diminish entropy of the system .",
    "consider now the following initial states @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the states ( [ ppt ] ) have positive partial transposition , but nevertheless are entangled @xcite .",
    "their entanglement is bound and can not be distilled @xcite .",
    "it can be checked by applying for example the realignment criterion of entanglement @xcite .",
    "the criterion can be stated as follows : if the trace norm of realigned state @xmath111 is greater then @xmath112 , the the state @xmath32 is entangled .",
    "we can also introduce the measure of entanglement based on this criterion .",
    "the so called realignment negativity @xcite @xmath113 of the state @xmath32 is defined by formula @xmath114 this measure can detect some bound entangled states , but not all of them . in the case of states ( [ ppt ] ) , the values of @xmath115",
    "are contained in the interval @xmath116 and the maximal value is attained for @xmath117 .    numerical analysis of the evolution of the initial states ( [ ppt ] ) indicates that their realignment negativity very rapidly goes to zero , but for the later times the states become entangled with positive values of negativity .",
    "thus the dynamics studied in the paper has a remarkable property : bound entangled initial states ( [ ppt ] ) evolve into `` free '' entangled asymptotic states . by a direct calculation",
    "one can show that the asymptotic states have the form ( [ roas ] ) with parameters @xmath118 the values of negativity of those asymptotic states are plotted in fig .",
    "we have studied entanglement production in the system of two three - level atoms in the @xmath4 configuration , coupled to the common vacuum . in the case of small ( compared to the radiation wavelength ) separation between the atoms , the system has nontrivial asymptotic states which can be entangled even if the initial states were separable .",
    "particular examples of such separable initial states are pure states in which the atoms are in different excited states .",
    "the process of the photon exchange between the atoms , produces correlations that entangle two atoms .",
    "it is interesting that when we superpose such initial states , we can enlarge the amount the asymptotic entanglement .",
    "we have also characterized the entanglement of asymptotic states for mixed diagonal initial states . using the description of mixed states in terms of degree of mixture and entanglement , we have found the region on the mixture - entanglement plane corresponding to such asymptotic states .",
    "we have also shown by considering a specific example that the dynamical evolution of that system brings bound entangled ppt states into `` free '' entangled nppt asymptotic states .",
