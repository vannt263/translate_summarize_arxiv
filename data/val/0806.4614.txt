    "historically , born - infeld ( bi ) nonlinear electrodynamics model was formulated in 1934@xcite . since it has been proposed as a viable model in low energy string theory , bi electrodynamics",
    "has attracted much attention from the fronts of both string theory and cosmology@xcite . while classical electrodynamics due to maxwell is a linear theory obeying the principle of superposition , in the latter these properties are not valid any more . in this respect",
    "the bi electrodynamics is comparable with the other nonlinear theories of physics such as yang - mills ( ym ) and gravitation .",
    "finding plane wave solutions in such a theory , for instance , in the presence of boundaries and/or background effects becomes a difficult task .",
    "coupling of bi electrodynamics to gravity has given birth to a new theory known as the einstein - born - infeld ( ebi ) gravity which found applications in string theory .",
    "the bi version of electromagnetism is already in the form of a string lagrangian , i.e. square root of a determinant , living inside higher dimensional worlds of branes .",
    "addition of higgs field and investigating its monopole solutions become equally attractive for the field theorists in the realm of confinement related problems@xcite .",
    "we recall that the original bi electrodynamics was introduced in order to resolve the self - energy divergence in the coulomb problem . with the advent of quantum electrodynamics this feature of bi theory",
    "was almost forgotten .",
    "coincidentally , beside other things , string theory was also introduced to eliminate divergences due to point - like structures .",
    "combination of these two theories ( i.e. bi and string theory ) is expected naturally to yield finite physical results .",
    "bi action in supergravity admits solitonic solutions known as d - branes which form the end points for open strings . in this paper , however , we shall not address ourselves to d - branes or dilatons , postponing these to a future study .",
    "a different theory , which will establish our strategy in this paper , is to consider the ebi action in which instead of the electromagnetic field we employ the non - abelian ym field @xcite . for this purpose",
    "we make use of a ym ansatz in the spherically symmetric spacetime .",
    "recently we have obtained such eym black hole solutions and extended it to the higher dimensional gauss - bonnet ( gb ) and lovelock theories @xcite .",
    "our method of solving the ym equations was to generalize the original wu - yang ansatz in n=4 , to higher dimensions @xmath6 in this ansatz the ym field is of magnetic type so that the invariant @xmath7 in the action , leaving behind the term @xmath8 as expected , employing ym instead of the maxwell field , accumulates different types of nonlinearities to yield , altogether a highly nonlinear model of gravity a la bi formalism . in the proper limit @xmath9 , where @xmath1 is called the bi parameter",
    ", we recover the einstein - hilbert action coupled with ym field in the standard way .",
    "einstein- hilbert action constitutes the simplest geometrical theory which involves mass as its parameter .",
    "its geometrical/ topological extensions employ higher order invariants with more parameters that provide extra degrees of freedom in the theory .",
    "the lovelock lagrangian is the most general lagrangian that admits second order equations without invoking ghost structures . by taking appropriate limits",
    "we recover all interesting cases obtained so far .",
    "it is remarkable that three highly non - linear theories , such as bi , ym and lovelock gravity are brought together in a common lagrangian which admits exact solutions .    in this paper",
    "we address to the issue of black hole solutions in the ebi action by incorporating ym fields in higher dimensions .",
    "naturally the bi parameter @xmath1 modifies the black holes and their thermodynamics properties .",
    "next , we consider the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) extension and search for new features brought in by the topological properties of the gb theory .",
    "the latter has the property that in the absence of a true cosmological constant @xmath10 , asymptotically it produces an effective one , @xmath11 to imitate the real one . in other words , the de - sitter ( ds ) and anti de - sitter ( ads ) spacetimes which are of utmost importance in the conformal field theory correspondence",
    "arise simply as boundary conditions of the spacetime .",
    "inclusion of the @xmath1 parameter adds further degrees of freedom to the theory .",
    "we find , for example , that @xmath1 can be employed to construct / regulate black hole horizons at wish .",
    "extension to the third order lovelock gravity , however , restricts our exact solution such that in the absence of a real cosmological constant it does not admit an effective one .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "@xmath12 we introduce the einstein - yang - mills - born - infeld ( eymbi ) action , metric , ym ansatzes and the resulting field equations . in the same section",

    "@xmath15 we follow the same patterns for the eymbigbl , in which the abbreviation l refers to the third order lovelock gravity .",
    "the paper ends with concluding remarks in sec . @xmath16 .",
