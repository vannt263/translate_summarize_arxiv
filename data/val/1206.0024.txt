    "the notion of entanglement , first noted by einstein , podolsky and rosen @xcite , is considered one of the main features of quantum mechanics , being subject of study in several areas recently @xcite .",
    "thus , it is of paramount importance both the understanding and the quantification of entanglement in composite quantum systems , being these one of the main challenges of modern quantum theory .    despite being a subject",
    "widely studied in systems of non - identical particles , or whose particles , though identical , are well separated from each other , being thus distinguishable , less attention was given to the case where this separation is very small , such that the overlap of their wave functions is no longer negligible . in this case",
    "we have to take into account the indistinguishability of the particles , being the space of quantum states restricted to symmetric or antisymmetric subspaces of the hilbert space , depending on the bosonic or fermionic nature of the system .",
    "the study of entanglement for systems of indistinguishable particles has been , however , a subject of great controversy , leading to different approaches in its treatment . among",
    "the most mentioned we have : quantum correlations @xcite , entanglement of modes @xcite , entanglement of particles @xcite .",
    "the concept of quantum correlations is based on the notion that the correlations generated by mere ( anti-)symmetrization of the state due to indistinguishability of their particles do not constitute truly as entanglement .",
    "we will analyse , in this paper , the quantum correlations in systems of indistinguishable fermions .",
    "the entanglement in two - fermion sates with a four - dimensional single - particle space ( @xmath0 ) can be characterized by the schliemann concurrence @xcite . for pure states in arbitrary dimension",
    ", one can use the von neumann entropy of the reduced single - particle density matrix as a measure of entanglement @xcite .",
    "however , the problem of quantification or even detection of entanglement in the general case is still open @xcite .",
    "a useful concept is that of entanglement witness @xcite : a hermitian operator with non - negative expectation value for all separable states , but which can have a negative expectation value for an entangled state .",
    "we will focus on optimal entanglement witnesses ( oew ) , that can be used not only to _ witness _ the entanglement , but also to quantify it @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will see how to determine such oews , and especially how to use them to quantify the quantum correlations in fermionic systems .",
    "we will also confront our measure of entanglement with the _ quantum discord _ @xcite . in order to do that",
    ", we will define a quantum discord for fermionic particles .",
    "previous studies of quantum discord in systems of indistinguishable particles , like in @xcite , employ the notion of correlation of modes @xcite , which are distinguishable .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[backgrounds ] we recall some known concepts and tools of the theory of entanglement , as the witnessed entanglement and the quantum correlations , which will be essential to the development of the ideas throughout the article . in sub - sec.[witnessed.entanglement ] , we recall the definition of optimal entanglement witness , and briefly discuss its use as an entanglement quantifier . in sub - sec.[quantum.correlations ]",
    "we recall the ideas associated with the concept of quantum correlations , as well as the schliemann concurrence . in sub - sec.[discord ] we revise the concept of quantum discord for distinguishable particles . in sec.[quantifying.quantum.correl ]",
    "we introduce our method for quantifying the quantum correlations in fermionic systems using witness operators , and define the fermionic generalized robustness .",
    "we also extend the notion of quantum discord to fermions , such that it takes into account the particles indistinguishability , and introduce the _ fermionic geometric discord_. in sec.[numerical.results ] we show numerical results , comparing the fermionic generalized robustness , the schliemann concurrence , and the fermionic geometric discord .",
    "we finish the illustration of the method with a beautiful _ quantum phase diagram _ yielded by the five - partite fermionic generalized robustness in the extended hubbard model .",
    "we conclude in sec.v .",
    "we will see , in this section , some familiar concepts from the theory of entanglement , namely , _ witnessed entanglement _ @xcite , quantum correlations @xcite and quantum discord @xcite .",
    "a reader already familiarized with such concepts might skip to the next section of the article .",
    "entanglement witnesses are hermitian operators ( observables - @xmath1 ) whose expectation values contain information about the entanglement of quantum states .",
    "the operator @xmath1 is an entanglement witness for a given entangled quantum state @xmath2 if the following conditions are satisfied @xcite : its expectation value is negative for the particular entangled quantum state ( @xmath3 ) , while it is non - negative on the set of separable states ( @xmath4 ) ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we are particularly interested in optimal entanglement witnesses .",
    "_ @xmath6 _ is the oew for the state @xmath2 if @xmath7 where @xmath8 represents a compact subset of the set of entanglement witnesses @xmath9 .",
    "oews can be used to quantify entanglement .",
    "such quantification is related to the choice of the set @xmath8 , where different sets will determine different quantifiers @xcite .",
    "we can define these quantifiers by : @xmath10    an example of a quantifier that can be calculated using oew is the generalized robustness of entanglement @xcite ( @xmath11 ) , which is defined as the minimum required mixture such that a separable state is obtained .",
    "precisely , it is the minimum value of @xmath12 such that @xmath13 be a separable state , where @xmath14 can be any state .",
    "we know that the generalized robustness can be calculated from eq.[oew ] , using @xmath15@xcite , where @xmath16 is the identity operator ; in other words , @xmath17    the construction of entanglement witnesses is a hard problem . in an interesting method proposed by brando and vianna @xcite",
    ", the optimization of entanglement witnesses is cast as a _ robust semidefinite program _ ( rsdp ) . despite rsdp",
    "is computationally intractable , it is possible to perform a probabilistic relaxation turning it into a semidefinite program(sdp ) , which can be solved efficiently @xcite .",
    "the space state for indistinguishable fermions is antisymmetric under permutation of particles . in this case , it is convenient to use the _ second quantization _ formalism , in order to deal with the antisymmetric states in the _ fock space_. accordingly we introduce an algebra of operators which satisfy the following anti - commutation relations : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the fermionic creation and annihilation operators , respectively , so that their application on the vacuum state ( @xmath21 ) creates / annihilates a fermion in state `` i '' .",
    "the vacuum state is defined so that @xmath22 .",
    "an immediate and disturbing consequence of the antisymmetric structure of the state space can be seen even in the simplest example of a two - fermion system , which , if analysed in the usual way , will always be considered entangled .",
    "we must therefore rethink the way entanglement is calculated for systems of indistinguishable particles , as well as its physical interpretation .",
    "in the case which the identical particles are localized in _ distinct _ laboratories and _ independently _ prepared , it is natural to think that the entanglement calculated in the usual way should not have any relevant physical meaning ; or rather , `` no quantum prediction , referring to an atom located in our laboratory , is affected by the mere presence of similar atoms in remote parts of universe '' @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the case of identical particles that are sufficiently close together such that the overlap between their wave functions is no longer negligible , and therefore they are indistinguishable .",
    "fermionic systems of this kind can be described using slater determinants @xcite .",
    "consider , for example , a two - fermion state represented by a single slater determinant , namely , @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 correspond to orthonormal wave functions ( _ spin - orbitals _ ) .",
    "it is easy to see , in this simple case , that the anti - symmetrization of coordinates introduces correlations between the fermions , namely , the well known _ exchange contributions _ from the hartree - fock theory . on the other hand ,",
    "a single slater determinant is solution of a one - particle schrdinger equation and , therefore , can have no quantum correlation between the particles @xcite . considering states",
    "described by more than one slater determinant introduces additional correlations beyond the exchange contribution",
    ". we will then interpret such additional correlations as the analog of quantum entanglement in systems of distinguishable particles , calling them as _ fermionic entanglement _",
    "@xcite .",
    "a measure of fermionic entanglement was proposed in @xcite as the analogous of wootters concurrence @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding , such measure , called schliemann concurrence ( @xmath26 ) , is valid only for two - fermion states with a four - dimensional single - particle hilbert space ( @xmath0 ) , i.e. the antisymmetric space of lowest dimension where can exist quantum correlated states .    in order to define the schliemann concurrence , we have to introduce some operators .",
    "let @xmath27 be the operator of particle - hole transformation : @xmath28 being @xmath29 the single - particle hilbert space dimension .",
    "similarly , define @xmath30 as the anti - linear operator of complex - conjugation , satisfying the following relations : @xmath31 thus , given the operator @xmath32 , called operator of dualisation , and the dual states @xmath33 , we have that the schliemann concurrence for states @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 are , in descending order of magnitude , the square roots of the singular values of the matrix @xmath37 .",
    "the total amount of correlations ( classical and quantum ) carried in a bipartite system is quantified by the mutual information : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the shannon ( von neumann ) entropy for the classical ( quantum ) system . in the classical case , the mutual information has another interpretation : it measures the decrease of ignorance about the subsystem @xmath40 , when @xmath41 is known . in this case , an equivalent expression for the mutual information reads : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the conditional entropy on @xmath40 given @xmath41 . in quantum systems",
    "this equivalence is not always true .",
    "the disagreement between these expressions is called _ quantum discord _ , and can be used to quantify quantum correlations @xcite : @xmath44 however , there is an ambiguity in @xmath45 due to the freedom of choice for the measurement operators , where for each set of measurements @xmath46 on b , the conditional entropy value may be different and consequently also the mutual information .",
    "the quantum discord is thus redefined by minimizing its value over all measurement operators .",
    "the mutual information is thus properly defined by : @xmath47 and it is known to quantify classical correlations @xcite .",
    "thus , the quantum discord measures the difference between the total and classical correlations on the system , therefore being a quantifier of quantum correlations .",
    "note however that quantum discord is not a measure of entanglement , and quantum separable states usually have non - zero discord .",
    "the quantum states with null discord are those which are a mere encoding of classical statistical distributions , and can be written in the form : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are orthonormal basis .",
    "given the set ( @xmath51 ) of states with zero - discord , formed by the states above , it is clear that the minimal distance between a state @xmath2 and this set can be used to quantify the quantum discord @xcite : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the schatten @xmath54 .",
    "a usual measure of quantum discord is based on the @xmath55-norm , or hilbert - schmidt norm , proposed by daki _",
    "in this section we will present our method for quantifying fermionic entanglement using witness operators . after defining the set of separable states pertinent to our case ,",
    "i.e. the fermionic states without entanglement , we will introduce a method for determining oews .",
    "in particular , we will see which constraints to impose on the set @xmath8 of witnesses ( eq.[oew ] ) in order to obtain a quantifier analogous to the generalized robustness ( eq.[rob.generalized ] ) .",
    "we also will define a notion of quantum discord for fermions and confront it to entanglement .",
    "we know that states without entanglement are those that can be described by a single slater determinant , or a convex mixture of them .",
    "consider @xmath56 as the fock space of @xmath57 indistinguishable fermions sharing a @xmath29-dimensional single - particle hilbert space .",
    "we have then the following definition of `` separable '' states : + _ * state with no fermionic entanglement ( separable ) : * _ a state @xmath58 has no fermionic entanglement if it can be decomposed as @xmath59 where @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is an orthonormal basis of fermionic creation operators for the space of a single fermion ( @xmath62 ) . of course",
    ", the states defined by eq.[separable.state.fock ] are not separable in the usual mathematical sense , meaning that they are product states or convex mixtures of it .",
    "but we will insist in referring to them as _ separable _ ,",
    "for they are just anti - symmetrization of the usual distinguishable separable states .",
    "entanglement , in the case of distinguishable particles , is defined in opposition to separability , i.e. , an entangled state is that one which is not separable .",
    "we want to keep this notion .",
    "it is interesting to note that , as in the case of distinguishable particles , the set of separable states is invariant under _ local operations _ , taking now into account that the local operations must be symmetric , due to the indistinguishability of the particles .",
    "let @xmath63 be a _ local symmetric operation _",
    "( lso ) , i.e. , an operation that respects the pauli exclusion principle and does not involve any interaction between particles . an lso can be written as : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a linear operator acting on the hilbert space of a single particle .",
    "given a fermionic separable pure state ( i.e. a single slater determinant ) @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the anti - symmetrization operator , @xmath68 is an orthonormal basis , and noting that @xmath69 = 0 $ ] , we see that @xmath70 and such result clearly extends to mixed states .",
    "summarizing , given a separable state @xmath71 , we have that @xmath72 , indicating that in order to have quantum entanglement , the particles must interact by means of some global operation .",
    "now we adapt brando and vianna s @xcite technique in order to obtain a new algorithm to determine oews for indistinguishable fermions in the fock space .",
    "the new method can be enunciated as follows .",
    "_ * determination of oew using rsdp : * _ a fermionic state @xmath73 is entangled if and only if the optimal value of the following rsdp is negative :    _ minimize @xmath74 subject to _",
    "@xmath75    where @xmath29 is the dimension of the single particle hilbert space , @xmath76 is an orthonormal basis of fermionic creation operators , @xmath67 is the anti - symmetrization operator , and @xmath77 is an operator acting on the space of one fermion .",
    "the notation @xmath78 means that @xmath79 is a positive semidefinite operator .",
    "if @xmath2 is entangled , the operator @xmath1 that minimizes the problem corresponds to the oew of @xmath2 . + _ * proof : * _ it is known that a state is entangled if and only if there exists a witness operator @xmath1 such that @xmath80 and @xmath81 for every separable state @xmath82 . consider a general separable state as given by eq.[separable.state.fock ] .",
    "the semi - positivity condition @xmath81 is equivalent to : @xmath83 for all @xmath84 note however that to satisfy eq.[awa ] , it is sufficient that the operator @xmath85 be positive semidefinite . thus follows directly that the operator @xmath1 satisfying the problem in eq.[rsdp ] corresponds to an optimal entanglement witness .",
    "+ the rsdp given above is solved by means of probabilistic relaxations it terms of sdps , as done in @xcite , where the set of infinite constraints is exchanged by a finite sample .",
    "thus the witness operator obtained is such that satisfy most of the constraints in eq.[rsdp ] . the small probability ( @xmath86 ) that a constraint be violated ( i.e. @xmath87 ) diminishes as the size of the sample of constraints increases .",
    "the constraint @xmath88 restricts the operator to the space of antisymmetric entanglement witnesses ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the other constraint , @xmath78 , follows directly from the anti - symmetrization of eq.[rob.generalized ] , and implies that the oew corresponds to the anti - symmetrized version of the generalized robustness , namely , @xmath90 @xmath91 measures the minimum required mixture with a fermionic state such that all the entanglement of @xmath2 is washed out . in other words ,",
    "the generalized robustness is the minimum value of @xmath12 such that @xmath92 be a separable state ( eq.[separable.state.fock ] ) , where @xmath93 can be any fermionic state .     versus schliemann concurrence @xmath94 , for random fermionic states uniformly distributed according to the haar measure .",

    "we also compare our fermionic geometric discord ( @xmath104 - eq.[geom.fermionic.disc ] ) with the fermionic generalized robustness for another one - parameter family of states in the space @xmath0 .",
    "we finish with calculations of _ multipartite entanglement _ in the extended hubbard model ( ehm ) , where @xmath95 can characterize _ quantum phase transitions_.    in fig.1 , we plot the fermionic generalized robustness against the schliemann concurrence for states generated randomly in the space @xmath0 .",
    "it is remarkable that @xmath94 and @xmath95 are one and the same for pure states , and @xmath94 is an upper bound for @xmath95 in the case of mixed states .",
