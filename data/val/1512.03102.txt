    "the twist - bend nematic ( @xmath0 ) phase is a fascinating new addition to the family of orientationally - ordered , liquid crystalline states of matter .",
    "it has been described as the  fifth nematic phase \" @xcite , complementing the uniaxial , biaxial , chiral helical ( cholesteric ) , and blue phase nematics .",
    "originally proposed by meyer @xcite , and later elaborated on theoretically by dozov @xcite , the existence of the @xmath0 phase was suggested experimentally @xcite and subsequently confirmed @xcite in low molecular weight liquid crystals ( lcs ) containing achiral dimers having an odd - numbered hydrocarbon linkage between the mesogenic ends .",
    "interest in these materials was also inspired by simulation studies @xcite , which predicted a nematic ",
    "nematic transition in lc dimers with odd - numbered linkages .",
    "the @xmath0 state possesses some remarkable properties .",
    "first , the average molecular long axis ( specified by a unit vector @xmath1 called the director ) simultaneously bends and twists in space . in the case of lc dimers with odd linkage , the specific tendency to bend is presumably caused by an all - trans conformation of the molecules , which results in their having a pronounced bent shape .",
    "the addition of twist allows the bend to be uniform everywhere in space .",
    "the combination of bend and twist produces an oblique helicoidal ( or heliconical ) winding of the director ( fig .",
    "1 ) , with a cone angle @xmath2 ( angle between the @xmath1 and the helicoidal axis ) of magnitude @xmath3 . this differs from an ordinary cholesteric lc phase , where a pure twist of @xmath1 results in a right - angle helicoid ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "second , the helicoidal pitch in the @xmath0 phase is on a molecular scale ",
    "i.e. , on the order of 10  nm @xcite  compared with cholesterics , where the supramolecular pitch typically exceeds 100  nm . the much larger pitch of a cholesteric may be attributed to the relative freedom of rotations around the long molecular axes , when the latter are orthogonal to the helical axis ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "this configuration mitigates the chiral part of intermolecular interactions @xcite .",
    "by contrast , in the @xmath0 state ( with @xmath6 ) , the bend - imposed hindrance of molecular rotations results in a much shorter , nanoscale modulation , which , however , remains purely orientational in nature ",
    "i.e , there is no associated variation in mass density ( no bragg peak detected by x - ray scattering @xcite ) .",
    "third , and again unlike a cholesteric , the component molecules of @xmath0-forming lcs are typically achiral .",
    "thus , the chiral nature of the helicoidal structure is spontaneously generated , with degenerate domains of left- and right - handed helicity .",
    "finally , although the @xmath0 phase shows no evidence of a macroscopic polarization , the flexoelectric effect @xcite associated with spontaneous bending of @xmath1 and the recent observation of an electroclinic effect @xcite in the @xmath0 phase suggest that a short - pitch helical polarization field is tied to the heliconical director structure ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "a recent theory @xcite describing the transition between uniaxial and twist - bend nematic phases invokes such a polarization field as the primary order parameter .    despite the intense experimental and theoretical efforts to explore the @xmath0 phase",
    ", the nature of collective fluctuation modes associated with the short - pitch helicoidal structure remains an open question .",
    "it is a vital one to address , since the spectrum and dispersion of these modes are closely related to the basic structural features and to the relevant order parameter(s ) , and because properties of the fluctuations provide an important test of theories describing the formation of the @xmath0 state .",
    "although previous dynamic light scattering measurements @xcite revealed a softening of the elastic constant associated with bend distortions of the director above the n-@xmath0 transition , they did not probe fluctuation modes specifically associated with the heliconical @xmath7 structure .",
    "here we report , to the best of our our knowledge , the first dls study of fluctuations within the @xmath0 phase and their critical behavior near the transition .",
    "our measurements reveal a pair of strongly temperature - dependent nonhydrodynamic modes plus a single hydrodynamic mode in the @xmath0 phase , and a single nonhydrodynamic mode and pair of hydrodynamic modes ( the usual director modes of a uniaxial nematic ) in the higher temperature nematic phase .",
    "we demonstrate excellent agreement between the behavior of the observed modes and new theoretical predictions based on a  coarse - grained \" version of a landau - de gennes free energy for the nematic to @xmath0 transition @xcite .",
    "the coarse - graining approximation , inspired in part by earlier theoretical work on cholesterics @xcite and appropriate in the limit of helical pitch much shorter than an optical wavelength , treats surfaces of constant phase in the heliconical structure as  pseudo - layers . \" within this approximation , which has been previously used to explain the effect of high magnetic fields on the @xmath0 phase @xcite and to account for its flow properties @xcite , the normal fluctuation modes involving the director may be mapped onto those of a chiral smectic - a phase , with effective layer spacing equal to the pitch , effective director parallel to the local pitch axis , and effective elastic constants that arise from the short - pitch orientational modulation rather than from a true mass density wave .",
    "an alternative approach to coarse - graining the @xmath0 phase has recently been published @xcite .",
    "our theory is generally consistent with that work , in that both theories describe the coarse - grained @xmath0 phase as an effective chiral smectic - a phase , with elastic constants for layer compression and layer bending .",
    "the new aspects of our approach are that it describes nonhydrodynamic as well as hydrodynamic fluctuation modes , and it relates all of the modes to microscopic fluctuations of the polarization as well as the director field .",
    "our experimental results agree well with this theoretical approach and , perhaps more significantly , support the centrality of a helical polarization field in describing the nematic to @xmath0 transition  an aspect which fundamentally distinguishes the @xmath0 phase from the other known nematic lc states , including , in particular , the cholesteric phase .",

    "the basic concept of the coarse - graining procedure is illustrated in fig .  1 .",

    "the local helical axis ( or pseudo - layer normal ) is given by the gradient @xmath150    we now consider the case of a well - aligned sample , as in a light - scattering experiment . in this case , the coarse - grained director @xmath144 has small fluctuations about @xmath101 , while the phase @xmath142 and coarse - grained polarization @xmath147 have small fluctuations around @xmath151 . the full orthonormal reference frame can be written as @xmath152 to quadratic order in @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "one might think that another variable would be needed to specify the vectors @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the plane perpendicular to @xmath13 .",

    "this mode is an @xmath185-dependent rotation of the @xmath179 , or equivalently an @xmath185-dependent displacement of the pseudo - layers , leading to curvature of the pseudo - layer structure .",

    "our coarse - graining of the @xmath0 phase is analogous to earlier work on coarse - graining of the cholesteric phase , which also has effective smectic elasticity @xcite .",

    "this mixture could explain the broadening of the slower decay indicated by our data analysis .    outside of the  dark director \" geometry , the twist - bend director scattering from @xmath206 , which is linear in @xmath198 , prevails , and the fast decay makes only a weak contribution to the dls correlation function  again in agreement with the experiment .",
    "the relaxation rate of the director mode ( fig .  6 ) decreases as @xmath79 from above , but only by a factor @xmath219 .",

    "it acquires a large energy gap when the heliconical structure forms , analogous to the gap in @xmath198 that develops in a smectic - a phase due to the large energy cost of tilting the director away from the layer normal .",

    "the temperature dependence of the hydrodynamic director modes on the nematic side has previously been explored on a different dimer material ",
    "see ref .",
    "results for this dependence on the mixture studied in the present work are similar to those presented in this reference .",
    "interestingly , a double exponential decay of the dls correlation function , with a nonhydrodynamic fast component , was observed many years ago in an ordinary rodlike nematic ( 8cb ) [ see s. tripathi , h. zhong , r. g. petschek , and c. rosenblatt , phys .",

    "these authors ultimately attributed the fast process ( which had a temperature - independent relaxation rate comparable to the rate we observe ) to biaxial correlations among molecules and/or to molecular conformational fluctuations with a large biaxial character . in the case of the bent - shaped lc dimers",
    ", one can imagine a natural connection between conformational motions and a polar ( vector ) order parameter that drives the n to @xmath0 transition .",
    "polar correlations in the plane perpendicular to the main director possess a biaxial charater , but are characterized by a vector rather than second rank tensor order parameter .",

    "in fact , using the values of cone angle @xmath2 and pitch wavenumber @xmath96 from the discussion section , assuming @xmath85 and the  bare \" @xmath86 ( maximum value in the nematic phase ) are in the pn range ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and neglecting the contribution of @xmath90 ( polarization elastic constant ) , one estimates from eq .  ( 26 ) that @xmath190 should be @xmath273 times lower in the @xmath0 phase than in the smectic - a phase of a typical thermotropic liquid crystal .",
