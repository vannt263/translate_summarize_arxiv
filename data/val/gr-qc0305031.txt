    "a braneworld model , whose gravity behaves as four dimensional at short distance scale but it shows higher dimensional nature at larger distances , was proposed by dvali , gabadadze , and porrati ( dgp)@xcite . in this model",
    ", the brane , on which the fields of the standard model are confined , has the induced einstein - hilbert term@xcite .",
    "this model has various cosmologically interesting features@xcite . particularly in the model with five dimensional bulk , an interesting cosmological solution was found , in which accelerated expansion of the universe at late epoch is realized without introducing the cosmological constant@xcite . based on this model , a novel mechanism that dilutes the cosmological constant was also proposed@xcite .",
    "although we have mentioned above that the gravity in this model at short distances is expected to behave as four dimensional , it is not so transparent if the model actually mimics four dimensional general relativity ( 4d gr ) .",
    "the linear analysis of this model shows that the tensor structure of the induced metric perturbations takes the five dimensional form even at short distance@xcite .",
    "the situation is analogous to the case of models with massive gravitons . in this case",
    "the deviation from 4d gr does not vanish even in the massless limit , which is known as the van dam - veltoman - zakharov discontinuity@xcite . in this context , the possibility that the 4d gr is recovered by non - linear effect was suggested by@xcite .",
    "there have been many discussions about this issue@xcite .",
    "we have in particular a clear statement that the discontinuity disappears when we introduce the cosmological constant@xcite .",
    "although the analysis with the cosmological constant is quite suggestive , the discontinuity is absent only when the limit is taken keeping the length scale determined by the cosmological constant much smaller than the compton wavelength of the massive graviton . the length scale determined by the cosmological constant must be longer than the hubble horizon size . hence , the recovery of 4d gr can not be proven by introducing negligibly small cosmological constant as far as the graviton mass is not completely negligibly small .    also specialized to the context of five dimensional dgp model , there are various works aiming at answering the question whether 4d gr is recovered at short distances or not , and many evidences that indicate the recovery of 4d gr were reported@xcite .",
    "it was shown that the evolution equation for homogeneous isotropic universe becomes identical to that for 4d gr when the hubble expansion rate is much larger than the inverse of the critical length scale , @xmath1@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was clearly shown that the linear analysis breaks down at scale shorter than @xmath2 since the brane bending becomes non - linear there .",
    "further , a consistent form of a black hole metric induced on the brane was presented .",
    "approximate black hole solution including the bulk was constructed under the restriction to spherically symmetric configurations@xcite .",
    "the same paper also gave the leading order correction to 4d gr , which is potentially observable by the future development of precision measurement of solar system@xcite .",
    "the results in ref .",
    "@xcite were extended to the case with the background of expanding universe@xcite .    in this paper , we develop an alternative formalism which can handle general perturbations in weak gravity regime . to handle general perturbations , we restrict our consideration to the case that the unperturbed metric on the brane is given by minkowski spacetime .",
    "we also make further generalization to the model that also takes into account the bulk cosmological constant and the brane tension balanced with it .",
    "( such generalized dgp model was discussed before in refs .",
    "we confirm the recovery of 4d gr at short distances and rederive the leading order correction to it .",
    "the model that we consider is defined by the five dimensional action @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are constants . @xmath6 and @xmath7 are , respectively , the curvature scalars corresponding to the five dimensional metric @xmath8 and the four dimensional one @xmath9 induced on the brane . here , we added both the bulk cosmological constant and the brane tension terms to the original dgp model .",
    "they are tuned to admit the minkowski brane as a vacuum solution .",
    "the model is reduced to the original one by setting @xmath10 .",
    "the unperturbed background geometry is given by five dimensional anti - de sitter spacetime @xmath11 with a brane located at @xmath12 , where @xmath13-symmetry is imposed . here",
    "@xmath14 is 4 dimensional minkowski metric .",
    "we follow the method of ref .",
    "@xcite introduced for the purpose of analyzing weak gravity in the randall - sundrum model  @xcite .",
    "we prepare two coordinate systems . in the coordinates @xmath15 , the gauge is chosen so that the metric perturbations @xmath16 can be easily computed in the five dimensional bulk .",
    "namely , we use the randall - sundrum gauge , @xmath17 in this paper the fifth direction is the direction of extra - dimension .",
    "the greek and latin indices represent four and five dimensional coordinates , respectively .",
    "the other coordinate system @xmath18 satisfies the gaussian normal conditions @xmath19 and also keeps the location of the brane unperturbed at @xmath20 . under the coordinate transformation @xmath21",
    ", the metric perturbation transforms as @xmath22 the argument of the variables is supposed to be @xmath23 unless otherwise is specified , and `` @xmath24 '' denotes a differentiation with respect to @xmath25 .",
    "the conditions that the @xmath26 component and @xmath27 components are zero in both coordinates provide equations for the gauge parameters , which are solved up to second order as @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the values of the gauge parameters evaluated on the brane , and @xmath31.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we assume the following order counting , @xmath32 and keep the terms up to @xmath33 . here",
    "@xmath34 is the order of the newton potential @xmath35 .",
    "later we will verify the consistency of this order counting .",
    "then , the transformation for @xmath36 components reduces to @xmath37 with @xmath38 hereafter , the greek indices are lowered or raised by the metric @xmath39 .",
    "the brane location is given by @xmath20 .",
    "hence in the @xmath15-coordinates the brane is bent . for simplicity",
    ", we impose the harmonic gauge condition , @xmath40 for the induced metric on the brane . to the second order in @xmath41 , this condition gives @xmath42 .",
    "\\label{hatximu}\\ ] ] from this relation , we find that the assumption @xmath43 is consistent if the assumed order of @xmath44 is correct .",
    "substituting  ( [ hatximu ] ) , the gauge transformation @xmath45 evaluated on the brane becomes @xmath46.\\ ] ] then , the trace of the induced metric is also evaluated as @xmath47    next we consider the junction condition . after a straightforward calculation",
    ", we can show @xmath48 with @xmath49 using this relation , the junction condition becomes @xmath50 .",
    "\\label{eq : junction}\\ ] ] the equation that determines the brane bending is obtained from the trace of the above equation as @xmath51 where we have introduced @xmath52^{-1}$ ] .",
    "we can neglect the last term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ bending ] ) because it is always higher order compared with the first term .",
    "the left hand side is something like the newton potential @xmath53 , hence we assume it to be @xmath33 . outside the matter distribution with the total mass @xmath54",
    ", the left hand side can be expressed as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 . at large scale ,",
    "@xmath57 , the first term on the right hand side dominates , while at small scale , @xmath58 , the second term dominates .",
    "therefore we have @xmath59 thus we find that our assumption as to the order counting for @xmath44 is justified .",
    "the remaining task is to evaluate @xmath60 .",
    "here we need to solve the bulk field equations .",
    "different from the r - s case , we solve the bulk equations with the dirichlet boundary condition ( [ transfin ] ) . here",
    ", we note that the location of the brane is not a straight sheet in the coordinates in the r - s gauge @xmath15",
    ".    we can give the general solution for the bulk field equations as a superposition of homogeneous mode solutions with purely outgoing boundary condition : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the modified bessel function and @xmath63 is the expansion coefficient . the coefficient @xmath63 is to be determined so as to satisfy the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath64 if we are allowed to approximate the above expression by setting @xmath65 , we have @xmath66 , and therefore we have @xmath67 we think that the errors caused by this naive approximation are not large , although any rigorous proof is not ready yet . if the leading errors are simply proportional to @xmath68 , we can neglect them since they are higher order in @xmath41 .",
    "such a naive expansion with respect to @xmath69 will be justified for small @xmath70 .",
    "but for large @xmath70 , we will not be allowed to expand the combination @xmath71 in the exponent . however , as we will see below , even the leading correction to the gravitational potential coming from the contribution of this part is suppressed to be irrelevantly small at small scale @xmath72 .",
    "hence , the errors due to this naive approximation can be crucial only if this approximation significantly underestimate the magnitude of @xmath73 , which is quite unlikely .    using  ( [ crudeapp ] ) , the junction condition ( [ eq : junction ] ) is written down explicitly as @xmath74 ,   \\qquad ( { \\rm at}\\quad \\bar y=0 ) , \\label{barhfin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 and @xmath76~.\\ ] ] here the quantitiy with @xmath77 represents the fourier coefficient of the corresponding variable as before .",
    "we show that in the square brackets on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ barhfin ] ) the first term gives the dominant contribution .",
    "we can drop the last two terms simply because they are always higher order in @xmath41 compared with the first term .",
    "the second term is irrelevant since it can be eliminated by a four - dimensional gauge transformation . as a result , the equation that determines",
    "the metric induced on the brane @xmath78 is reduced to the one for the linear theory .",
    "the only difference is in the equation that determines the brane bending ( [ bending ] ) .    the order of magnitude of the first term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ bending ] ) is estimated as @xmath79 at small scale , and hence it is suppressed by the factor @xmath80 compared with the newton potential @xmath53 .",
    "the leading behavior of the induced metric is therefore determined by setting the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ barhfin ] ) to zero .",
    "thus we conclude that 4d gr is recovered by taking into account the non - linear brane bending for weak gravity at small scale @xmath81 .",
    "if we take the limit @xmath82 , all length scales come into this regime .",
    "hence , we have confirmed the absence of van dam - veltman - zakharov discontinuity .",
    "however , because of the factor @xmath83 the leading order deviation from 4d gr at small scale is less strongly suppressed than the naively expected suppression @xmath84 , as first pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite .    at large scale , this term becomes more and more important . for @xmath85",
    ", we have @xmath86 this is nothing but the result for the linearized case . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the regime where the linear theory is valid .",
    "after that , in the succeeding section , we discuss the leading order correction to the 4d gr at short distance scale assuming static and spherically symmetric configurations .",
    "in this section we consider perturbations at large scale @xmath87 , where the linear theory is valid .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ linearxi ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ barhfin ] ) , we obtain @xmath88 with @xmath89    first we look at the behavior of the propagator @xmath90 , which is already discussed in ref .",
    "when we consider the length scale much smaller than @xmath5 , we have @xmath91 at the length scale smaller than @xmath0 ( @xmath92 ) , the propagator @xmath93 behaves as that for a four dimensional field . on the other hand , at the intermediate scale between @xmath0 and @xmath5 ( @xmath94 ) , the propagator behaves as that for a five dimensional field .",
    "when the length scale is much larger than @xmath5 , @xmath95 goes to @xmath96 .",
    "thus we have @xmath97 hence again the propagator @xmath93 behaves as a four dimensional field , but the newton s constant is not given by @xmath98 but by @xmath99 .",
    "next we turn to the tensor structure specified by @xmath100 . for four dimensional massless graviton",
    "we have @xmath101 , while @xmath102 for the case of massive graviton . for @xmath103 ,",
    "we have @xmath104 we have @xmath105 for @xmath106 , while @xmath107 for @xmath106 . on the other hand , for @xmath108 , we have @xmath105 irrespective of the ratio between @xmath5 and @xmath0 .",
    "the results are summarized in fig.1 . when @xmath109 , the 4d gr is realized by the randall - sundrum mechanism .",
    "the effective planck mass differs from @xmath110 in this case . on the other hand , when @xmath72 , the gravity becomes four dimensional again , but the tensor structure differs from 4d gr .",
    "we consider a static spherical symmetric non - relativistic star . assuming that the energy momentum tensor is dominated by the @xmath26-component @xmath111",
    ", we neglect the effect of pressure when we solve the metric perturbation .",
    "first we solve non - linear equation for @xmath44 ( [ bending ] ) . under the present assumptions , eq .",
    "( [ bending ] ) is simplified as @xmath112 this equation can be immediately integrated once , and we obtain @xmath113 where @xmath114 outside the star , we have @xmath115 . solving the above equation with respect to @xmath116",
    ", we have @xmath117 here we have chosen the signature in front of the square root imposing the condition that @xmath116 does not become large at @xmath118 .",
    "the other branch with `` + '' sign is outside the scope of the present formalism since we have assumed the minkowski brane background . at small scale",
    ", this expression reduces to @xmath119 outside the matter distribution , we simply have @xmath120 .",
    "hence , the correction to the newton potential is given by @xmath121 which recovers the result obtained in ref .",
    "we developed a formalism to calculate the metric perturbations induced by the matter localized on the brane in the generalized dgp model , in which the bulk cosmological constant and the brane tension terms are added .",
    "here we clarified the mechanism for disappearing the van dam - veltman - zakharov discontinuity in this model . in our approach ,",
    "the crucial point was to take into account a part of second order perturbations of the brane bending .",
    "this method was largely motivated by the recent works by @xcite .",
    "our scheme almost completely controls the order of magnitude of the neglected higher order correction terms . in this sense , we think that this work gives an alternative sufficiently satisfactory proof of the absence of the van dam - veltman - zakharov discontinuity in the dgp model . under the restriction to the static and spherically symmetric source , we confirmed that our formulation correctly reproduces the leading order correction to 4d gr at short distances obtained in @xcite .",
