    "how small can a massive object gravitationally collapse without producing a singularity , while still satisfying the null energy condition ( nec ) ? in the context of general relativity ( gr )",
    "the answer is quite clear . in the spherically symmetric case ,",
    "the vacuum outside the matter distribution is described by the schwarzschild metric ; and once the matter collapses to a size smaller than the schwarzschild radius , trapped surfaces will form forcing even light rays to fall towards the center . unlike the schwarzschild black hole , electrically charged ( reisner - nordstorm , rn ) black holes have a time - like singularity and the region surrounding the singularity is free of trapped surfaces , although there exists closed trapped surfaces farther away from the singularity .",
    "so , one could naively expect that an arbitrarily compact static matter distribution can give rise to a charged black hole - like external geometry .",
    "however , according to penrose s singularity theorem , if the matter obeys null energy condition ( nec ) , then the existence of a single closed trapped surface would produce a singularity @xcite .",
    "hence a rn exterior can not be produced by an arbitrarily compact singularity - free matter distribution without violating nec .",
    "although cosmic censorship hypothesis proposes , for philosophical reasons , that any singularity should be shielded by trapped surfaces and event horizon @xcite , it is in principle possible to produce naked singularities in gravitational collapse @xcite in gr .",
    "exact solutions with naked singularities can be realized in gr by simply introducing massless scalar charge , given by the jnw metric @xcite .",
    "there are distinct observational differences in gravitational lensing phenomena that can distinguish such solutions from the black hole solutions @xcite ; hence theoretically exploring such solutions is very important .",
    "any theory of gravity that leads to positive mass naked singularity solutions can be expected to accommodate arbitrarily compact singularity - free matter distribution satisfying nec . in this paper , we focus on one such theory that minimally modifies gr by introducing torsion in an extra dimension so as to hide the extra dimension from the visible dimensions @xcite , abbreviated in this paper as _ thed _",
    "__t__orsion to _",
    "_ h__ide _ _ e__xtra _ _ d__imension . here",
    "we restrict our focus on the existence of singularity - free solutions ; so we do not study a detailed gravitational collapse , rather we focus on static shells with surface density and pressure satisfying the nec .",
    "although nec is the weakest of the energy conditions , it appears to be the only energy condition in agreement with known macroscopic matter and energy sources in the universe .",
    "any stronger energy condition seems to be violated at high energies or due to quantum effects . for a comprehensive review of the energy conditions ,",
    "see @xcite . here",
    "we shall take the reasonable stance that if nec satisfying matter can be compressed to arbitrarily small size without creating trapped surfaces , then collapse singularities can potentially be completely avoided in that theory gravity .",
    "it is conventionally accepted that quantum gravity effects will prevent the formation of singularity inside black holes . from a string theory perspective",
    ", it has been proposed that stable states of intersecting brane configurations can give rise to singularity - free quantum - fuzzball solutions @xcite .",
    "horizonless solutions that appear as black holes at large distances can be constructed from a variety of brane configurations @xcite .",
    "however , here we shall just consider gravity at the classical level and examine the possibility of arbitrarily compact horizonless singularity - free solutions .    in section 2 ,",
    "we start with a brief review of thed gravity explaining how it minimally modifies gr . in section 3",
    ", we analyze the properties of positive mass naked singularity solutions . in section 4",
    ", we apply israel s junction conditions @xcite to derive the surface density and pressure on a static shell in thed gravity . in section 5",
    ", we numerically evaluate the validity of nec on compact shells , and compare the solution from thed gravity to that in rn and jnw geometries .",
    "in section 6 , we discuss some implications of this work in generally avoiding gravitational singularities .",
    "torsion has been the natural mathematical ingredient needed to formalize the gravitational effects of matter with spin @xcite , and it plays an essential role in deriving palatini theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that the effects of torsion could be strong enough to even avoid big bang singularity in the early universe leading to a singularity - free bounce cosmology @xcite and bubble universes within black holes @xcite .",
    "in contrast to other theories with torsion , in thed gravity torsion plays a purely algebraic role .",
    "it is not dynamically independent and it does not couple to the spin of matter , rather it is completely determined in terms of the metric to ensure that the extra dimension remains hidden .",
    "we shall briefly summarize the formulation of this theory , but see @xcite for details .",
    "we start by visualizing the 5d space - time as foliated by 4d hypersurfaces ( with coordinates @xmath1 ) along the fifth dimension @xmath2 , with metric @xmath3 ^ 2   .",
    "\\label{5dmetric}\\ ] ] the connection @xmath4 for this geometry is prescribed to ensure that any motion along the fifth dimension is unobservable and its 4d components are chosen to be torsionless as in gr .",
    "this is achieved by imposing the algebraic constraints @xmath5 and @xmath6}}}=0 $ ] . by analyzing the geodesic equations , note that any motion along the fifth dimension does not affect the 4d components of the geodesic equations .",
    "these constraints along with the metricity condition completely determine all the components of torsion in terms of the metric .",
    "remarkably , this theory is indistinguishable from torsion - free gr at a kinematic level .",
    "first , the 4d metric on the hypersurfaces , @xmath7 , is independent of @xmath2 , making all the hypersurfaces identical ; this can be viewed as a consequence of imposing the fifth dimension to be hidden .",
    "second , the components of the connection and the curvature tensor that are tangential to any hypersurface are identical to those in gr with metric @xmath7 . in effect , the terms contributed by the torsion exactly cancel off the terms contributed by the effect of the extra - dimension in evaluating the 4d components of connection and curvature . hence , hiding the extra dimension by requiring any motion along that dimension to not have any effect on the observable 4d motion , leads to a theory where the kinematic equations are identical to those in gr . at this level , this formalism does not require us to explicitly choose a topology for the extra dimension  it could be either a compact dimension or a large unbounded dimension .",
    "since torsion is completely metric dependent in this framework , the field equations are derived by varying the action only with respect to the metric , and they take the form , in comparison to the original derivation of eq .  [ fe ] in @xcite .",
    "this is to accommodate the change in sign convention in the definition of @xmath8 , which will be convenient to derive junction conditions following @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath9 where @xmath8 is the standard einstein tensor constructed using the metric @xmath7 as in gr , and the additional term @xmath10 takes the following simple form .",
    "@xmath11 where @xmath12 , is a 4 vector whose indices are raised and lowered with the 4d metric @xmath7 .",
    "similarly , the covariant derivative @xmath13 is defined as in gr with christoffel connection defined with the 4d metric @xmath7 .",
    "note that the field equations only involve the 4d metric @xmath7 and the scalar function @xmath14 , while the metric components @xmath15 have completely decoupled out of the field equations . since only the 4d metric components @xmath7 and the 4d components of stress tensor @xmath16 are relevant for physical observations , eq .",

    "clearly , this theory reduces to gr when @xmath17 vanishes . in gr",

    "to self consistently solve the field equations , it may be useful as a rule of thumb to explicitly impose matter conservation @xmath18 , which also leads to an independent evolution equation for @xmath17 , namely @xmath19 .",
    "to study the dynamics of a spherically symmetric collapse in thed gravity , we need to solve the set of messy equations given in appendix - a derived from the field equations eq .",
    "however , here we simply focus on the existence of compact non - singular solutions .",
    "so , we look at static spherically symmetric solutions where the external geometry is vacuum .",

    "[ eq : acc ] ) is however finite with @xmath80 ; hence we might expect @xmath81 to be a coordinate singularity , and that the solution could be extended to the region @xmath82 . however , it is impossible to self consistently extend the solution for @xmath57 beyond @xmath83 , from eq .",
    "[ eq : x ] without introducing an arbitrary discontinuity in @xmath57 at @xmath83 , which would then render the boundary conditions at infinity defining the mass @xmath42 meaningless .",

    "thus the singularity at @xmath89 is a naked singularity .    to understand why we obtain naked singularity solutions as opposed to black hole solutions , note that the vacuum field equations ( eq .",

    "the violation of nec by the @xmath10 is however irrelevant to the energy conditions satisfied by a compact matter distribution producing a vacuum exterior .",
    "the absence of trapped surfaces gives rise to a possibility that with sufficiently large pressure , matter can be compressed to arbitrarily small size , without forming a singularity while still satisfying nec .",
