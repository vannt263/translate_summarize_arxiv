    "athermal soft matter systems with particles interacting via repulsive contact forces , such as granular materials , foams and emulsions , undergo a percolating transition known as the jamming transition when , on increasing the density , particles can no longer avoid making contacts .",
    "we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews . at the jamming transition",
    "a percolating network of contact forces appears , and the system acquires mechanical rigidity .",
    "we have recently shown that the jamming transition is the first of a series of higher  order jamming crossovers  @xcite .",
    "the origin of these crossovers can be understood by considering the radial distribution function of dense particle systems , which allows one to define a sequence of coordination shells .",
    "the jamming transition marks the point where each particle contacts those of its first coordination shell .",
    "the jamming crossovers then occur at higher density as particles interact with those of subsequent coordination shells .",
    "accordingly , at zero temperature these crossovers are characterized by an increase of the mean number of contacts per particle .",
    "this is accompanied by a change in the mechanical response of the system , which becomes more non - affine . at finite temperature",
    "this leads to density anomalies , such as an increasing diffusivity upon isothermal compression , and a negative thermal expansion coefficient  @xcite .",
    "these anomalies are analogous to those observed in water and in some other network forming liquids  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the investigation of the jamming crossovers may shed light on the microscopic origin of these phenomena .",
    "in particular , the observed correlation between the jamming crossovers and the density anomalies suggest that these anomalies might be related to the structural changes occurring at the crossovers .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the structural changes occurring at the first jamming crossover in a bidisperse mixture of disks interacting via a finite - range , repulsive harmonic potential .",
    "we show that there is a well defined volume fraction @xmath0 at which the formation of contacts with particles of the first coordination shell ends , and a larger well defined volume fraction @xmath1 at which the formation of contacts with particles of the second coordination shell begins ; this is the location of the first jamming crossover .",
    "we provide evidence that in the volume fraction range @xmath2 two particles are in contact if and only if they are also voronoi neighbors , and the average contact number per particle @xmath3 is then constant and fixed to @xmath4 by euler s theorem for planar graphs .",
    "the formation of contacts between non  voronoi neighbors , which occurs for @xmath5 , induces mechanical instabilities and avalanches that restructure the whole force network , with the net effect of producing a large number of weakly compressed bonds .",
    "these structural changes allow us to rationalize the softening of the system on compression , as well as the volume fraction dependence of the normal mode density of states and the spatial structure of the normal mode vectors .",
    "we investigated the zero temperature properties of a @xmath6:@xmath6 mixture of soft disks , with diameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and equal mass @xmath9 .",
    "two particles @xmath10 and @xmath11 interact via a harmonic potential when in contact , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the overlap between the particles .",
    "this is expressed in terms of @xmath14 , the average of the two particle diameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and the distance @xmath17 between the particles ; @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential ] ) is the heaviside function .",

    "gradient algorithm  @xcite , starting from an initial configuration with randomly placed particles .",
    "we considered values of volume fraction separated by at most @xmath20 , and used measurements taken at successive values of the volume fraction to estimate volume fraction derivatives  @xcite .",

    "the bulk modulus , finally , changes discontinuously at the transition .",
    "here we focus on the volume fraction dependence of these quantities at higher volume fractions , and note that while @xmath3 grows monotonically on compression ( fig .",
    "[ fig : crossovers]a ) , the rate of formation of new contacts oscillates ( fig .",
    "[ fig : crossovers]b ) .",
    "these oscillations can be interpreted as higher order jamming crossovers .",
    "indeed , while at the jamming transition @xmath22 diverges when particles make contacts with other particles in their first coordination shell , at higher volume fraction @xmath22 increases again as particles form contacts with subsequent coordination shells .",
    "the oscillations of @xmath22 are correlated with those of the bulk modulus @xmath23 , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : crossovers]c , suggesting a relation between the geometric and the mechanical properties of the system .",

    "each jamming crossover would then be identified with the volume fraction where the formation of contacts with particles of a new shell starts .",
    "it is possible that the process of formation of such contacts might terminate before the next jamming crossover begins . in the intervening range of volume fractions ,",
    "@xmath3 is then constant and @xmath39 : all contacts with particles of a given shell are established , and no contacts with particles of the subsequent shell form . however , this scenario is not very common as successive crossovers usually mix , leading to a rate of formation of new contacts that is generically nonzero , @xmath40 .",
    "harmonic disks in two dimensions are peculiar in this respect , as the formation of contacts in the first neighbor shell , which starts at the jamming transition @xmath41 , ends at a volume fraction @xmath0 well below the first jamming crossover at @xmath1 .",
    "we show that this is the case by investigating the volume dependence of @xmath42 , motivated by the fact that fig .",

    "[ fig : op]c we determine @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we note , however , that accurate estimates of these volume fractions are difficult to obtain because of the high exponents characterizing the relevant power laws .",

    "the value @xmath43 of the mean contact number in the volume fraction range leading up to the first jamming crossover can be rationalized .",
    "indeed , euler s theorem for planar graphs fixes to @xmath51 the average connectivity of any tessellation of space in two dimensions , in the limit of large system size .",
    "since the simplest tessellation is the voronoi one , we speculate that @xmath4 for @xmath38 because in this volume fraction range two particles are in contact if and only if they are also voronoi neighbors . to check this hypothesis , we investigate the volume fraction dependence of two order parameters related to the voronoi ( radical  @xcite ) tessellation .    the first one , @xmath34 , is the fraction of voronoi neighbors that are not in contact ; the second one , @xmath35 , is the fraction of contacts that occur between particles which are not voronoi neighbors .",
    "[ fig : op]b shows that @xmath34 and @xmath35 are non - zero for @xmath52 and for @xmath53 , and vanish at @xmath0 and at @xmath27 , respectively .",

( b ) to highlight the non  affine rearrangements occurring at the jamming crossovers , we plot the actual overlap probability distribution at volume fraction @xmath57 and the one resulting from an affine compression of the system from @xmath58 to @xmath57 ( solid line ) . ]    we next look at what happens for volume fractions above @xmath27 , where the mean contact number @xmath3 begins to rise again with @xmath36 .",
    "particles now start to make contacts with those of their second coordination shell .",
    "as these new contacts are formed , the entire force network undergoes a marked restructuring . to investigate the nature of this , we study the volume fraction evolution of the overlap probability distribution function , @xmath54 .",
    "we normalize @xmath59 across the interacting particles , so that @xmath60 .",
    "a negative overlap corresponds to the distance between the surfaces of two particles that are not in contact .",
    "( this is the reason why we monitor distributions of overlaps rather than forces ; while for positive @xmath55 force and overlap are identical for our harmonic potential , forces are zero for all particle pairs with negative @xmath55 and so provide less information on the packing geometry . ) figure  [ fig : pd]a shows that the evolution of @xmath54 across the first jamming crossover is characterized by the growth of a peak at small values of @xmath61 , and by the simultaneous decrease of the peak at larger overlaps .",
    "such a sharp variation of the overlap probability distribution signals the presence of a non  affine evolution of the force network on compression .",
    "indeed , in the affine approximation the overlap @xmath62 between particles @xmath10 and @xmath11 evolves as ( with the spatial dimension being @xmath63 in our case ) @xmath64 and consequently the overlap distribution around @xmath65 mainly shifts on compression .",
    "we illustrate this point in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd]b , where we compare the distributions @xmath59 at volume fraction @xmath57 for two different systems .",

    "gradient protocol , the other by minimizing the energy at @xmath58 and then affinely compressing the system to @xmath57 .",
    "the two distributions differ strongly , and the comparison demonstrates that the jamming crossover induces a non  affine transformation of the force network on compression whose main effect is a large increase in the number of small overlaps .",
    "these small overlaps must mainly result from the relaxation of old compressed bonds .",
    "indeed , since at @xmath58 the overlap distribution close to @xmath66 is small , @xmath67 , we know that at this volume fraction there are very few particles that almost touch and so can be brought into contact on compression .",
    "the fact that the evolution of the overlap distribution on compression is characterized not only by the growth of a peak at small overlaps but also by a decrease of the peak at large overlaps , further suggests that some compressed bonds relax . to see this process at work we investigate the evolution of the overlaps in a system prepared at @xmath58 and then compressed quasistatically , with energy minimized at each step in volume fraction , to @xmath57 . in the scatter plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : scatter ] we show the overlaps @xmath68 of each pair of particles that is in contact before and/or after the compression .",
    "the figure illustrates that a number of large overlaps at @xmath58 become small at @xmath57 . while there also some new bonds with small overlaps , the majority of small overlaps arises by rearrangement of previously strongly compressed bonds .",
    "this clarifies that the formation of a relatively small number of contacts with particles in the second coordination shell ( @xmath69 at @xmath57 ) induces a rearrangement of the whole force network , with the latter leading to an abundance of small contacts .",

    "we saw in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatter ] that , when a system beyond the first jamming crossover is compressed in a quasistastic manner , particle overlaps change significantly , sometimes by amounts of the order of the overlap itself .",
    "this suggests that these changes do not originate from a continuous deformation of the system , but rather from large scale catastrophic rearrangements , i.e.  avalanches related to mechanical instabilities .",
    "indeed , on increasing the volume fraction one changes the linear system of equations that governs the mechanical equilibrium of the system , and may therefore induce a mechanical instability .",
    "these instabilities are well known to occur in athermal systems under quasistatic shear , where they lead to sudden drops of the shear stress . to our knowledge avalanches in compression , which are expected to lead to discontinuities in the pressure",

    "the figure demonstrates the existence of avalanches that cause a rearrangement of the force network of the system . ]",
    "we have confirmed this avalanche scenario by investigating the volume fraction dependence of the pressure , @xmath71 , and of the energy , @xmath72 , of a system of @xmath73 particles that is compressed quasistatically from @xmath58 to @xmath74 in increments of @xmath75 .",
    "[ fig : compression ] shows that the volume fraction dependence of the pressure is characterized by a large number of discontinuities ; these are more clearly visible in the derivative @xmath76 .",
    "discontinuities are also present in the energy as a function of @xmath36 .",
    "they are small and therefore difficult to see by eye on the scale of the graph , but can again be detected by looking at the volume fraction dependence of @xmath77 .",
    "note that all avalanches induce a decrease of the elastic energy of the system , as expected . on the other hand , even though most avalanches also induce a decrease in pressure , there are some that have the opposite effect . since on compressing the system the average value of the pressure continues to increase , the compression - induced dynamics clearly does not reach a steady state , providing an important distinction to the case of quasistatic shear . in this respect , avalanches in compression bear more resemblance to those associated with barkhausen noise in ferromagnetic systems .",
    "although global ordering is not expected in bidisperse systems such as the one studied here , it is still possible that compression to high volume fractions may change the local order around particles .",
    "we next show that such a change does indeed occur at the first jamming crossover . to do this we measure local ordering via an extension of the local bond - orientational order parameter probing @xmath78-fold symmetry in two dimensions  @xcite . this extended parameter is defined as follows : @xmath79 here the first sum runs over all particles @xmath10 , and the second one over all @xmath80 overlaps @xmath62 of particle @xmath10 with other particles .",

    "in particular , the study of the spatial structure of the low frequency eigenvectors suggested that they may share some features of rigid unit modes  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , these modes should play an important role in causing the density anomalies of these systems  @xcite .",
    "it would therefore be interesting to repeat our zero  temperature study in simple models of water and of some other liquids with density anomalies  @xcite .    an intriguing question raised by our results concerns the connection between the geometric and mechanical properties of particle systems .",
    "indeed , since connectivity strongly influences the mechanical properties of a network  @xcite , then close to the jamming transition it has been possible to express the mechanical moduli in terms of the excess contact number @xmath136  @xcite .",
    "these scaling relations predict that the bulk and the shear modulus both vary monotonically with @xmath136 .",
    "our results clarify that this monotonic behavior breaks down at jamming crossovers occuring at higher volume fractions , and therefore prove that the mechanical properties are not simply related to the connectivity .",
    "simple arguments to explain mechanical properties in terms of geometric ones away from jamming should therefore be developed ; we speculate that they would need to take account of the heterogeneity of the force network as a key feature of highly compressed particle systems .",
