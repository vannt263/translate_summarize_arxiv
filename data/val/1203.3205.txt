    "to a surprising extent , the electronic properties of most metals are well described by landau fermi liquid theory .",
    "the key building blocks of this theory are quasi - particles and a fermi surface , the surface in momentum space that demarcates filled from empty states . for a system of weakly interacting electrons ,",
    "the shape of the fermi surface is isotropic . on the other hand ,",
    "if the interactions among the quasi - particles are strong enough , other possibilities might emerge .",
    "pomeranchuk @xcite showed that forward scattering among quasi - particles with non - trivial angular momentum and spin structure can lead to an instability of the ground state towards forming an anisotropic fermi surface .",
    "for example , the simplest form of a two - dimensional nematic fermi liquid can be thought of , in the continuum limit , as a realization of the pomeranchuk instability in the angular momentum @xmath2 and spin @xmath3 particle - hole channel whereby a circular fermi surface spontaneously distorts and becomes elliptical with a symmetry of a quadrupole ( @xmath4-wave ) .",
    "such an instability , depicted in figure [ pomeranchuk cartoon](a ) , is often referred to in the literature as the quadrupolar pomeranchuk instability , @xmath3 channel . ) in this paper , however , we only focus on the quadrupolar pomeranchuk instability and the resulting nematic phase . ] . in practice",
    ", however , the instability breaks the discrete point group symmetry of the underlying lattice . as such , systems undergoing a pomeranchuk instability exhibit manifestly distinct transport properties along the different crystal axes .",
    "experimentally several instances of anisotropic transport in strongly correlated electronic systems have been reported @xcite and occupy much of the current focus in correlated electron matter .",
    "although it is unclear at present whether the pomeranchuk mechanism is the only root cause , it nevertheless offers a framework where such anisotropies can be characterized in detail .",
    "so far , much of the work in this direction has focused on reaching the nematic phases of correlated electron matter , via the pomeranchuk instability , in a weakly interacting fermi fluid @xcite .",
    "a natural question to ask is whether a nematic phase could be approached , via a pomeranchuk instability , from a non - fermi liquid phase . to answer the question",
    ", one has to address the origin of the pomeranchuk instability beyond the fermi liquid framework . unlike fermi liquids",
    ", there is no notion of stable quasi - particles in non - fermi liquids .",
    "nevertheless , non - fermi liquids have sharp fermi surfaces .",
    "consequently , a pomeranchuk instability , viewed simply as a spontaneous shape distortion of the underlying fermi surface , is still a theoretical possibility .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=332]-0.1 in    we explore here how such an instability can be studied using the gauge - gravity duality , hereafter referred to as holography .",
    "the duality , which maps certain @xmath4-dimensional strongly coupled quantum field theories to ( @xmath5)-dimensional semiclassical gravitational theories in asymptotically ads spacetimes , is a promising tool in modeling some features of strongly correlated condensed matter systems . for reviews on the applications of holography for condensed matter physics ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we take the system to be @xmath6 dimensional , as this is the most interesting case experimentally @xcite .",
    "also , we consider the case where the broken phase is a nematic ( non-)fermi liquid with the symmetry of a quadrupole . in other words , we only explore the possibility of a quadrupolar pomeranchuk instability .",
    "such an instability is characterized by an order parameter which is a neutral symmetric traceless tensor @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote spatial indices .",
    "thus , in order to use holography to realize the transition to such a phase in the boundary theory , one has to turn on a neutral massive spin - two field @xmath10 in the bulk and show that , under some circumstances , it develops a non - trivial normalizable profile in the bulk radial direction . from the point of view of the physics in the bulk , there is a serious hurdle that one needs to overcome in order to successfully describe the propagation of a massive spin - two field , which has to do with the existence of extra unwanted degrees of freedom ( ghosts ) and superluminal modes .",
    "eliminating ghosts and superluminal modes within a theory that also allows for the condensation of the operator dual to the massive spin - two field is the first step . in addition",
    ", a coupling of the correct type must be introduced in the bulk between the massive spin - two field and the fermions in order to bring about the shape distortion of the fermi surface in the boundary .",
    "we present here a minimal model which can address each of these problem , and show that the isotropic fermi surface of the boundary non - fermi liquid gets spontaneously distorted and becomes elliptical .",
    "we also find that the broken ( nematic ) phase is a non - fermi liquid .",
    "we interpret this transition as a holographic realization of the quadrupolar pomeranchuk instability in non - fermi liquids .",
    "nonetheless , a disclaimer is necessary here .",
    "the background we study can not be extended consistently to @xmath11 on the count that so doing would require the back reaction of the gauge field .",
    "such a back - reacted metric would be non - einstein and there is no causal lagrangian for a spin - two field in a curved background that is not einstein . within the background we consider , the vaccuum expectation value of the spin - two field actually grows as the temperature is increased .",
    "consequently , there is strictly no instability in the traditional sense in the context of spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "hence , our usage of the term instability is not entirely warranted .",
    "nonetheless , the program we outline here does provide a consistent holographic framework to address how to engineer shape distortions of the underlying fermi surface .",
    "hence , it serves as a valid first step in realizing the physics of the pomeranchuk instability .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "section ii sets up the lagrangian for the neutral massive spin - two field . included here will be an explicit mechanism for obtaining a normalizable profile for the bulk spin - two field .",
    "section iii contains the fermonic degrees of freedom as well as the results illustrating that the low - lying excitations are non - fermi liquid in nature as well as the shape distortion of the underlying fermi surface .",
    "since we want to explore the possibility of a transition from a non - fermi liquid to a nematic fermi liquid phase in the boundary , the first step is to construct a background which consistently incorporates a neutral massive spin - two field @xmath10 .",
    "this field is dual to the operator whose vacuum expectation value ( vev ) is the order parameter for the nematic phase .      in flat @xmath12-dimensional minkowski spacetime , fierz and",
    "pauli suggested @xcite a lagrangian for a free neutral massive spin - two field which is quadratic in derivatives and correctly describes the propagating degrees of freedom for such a field .",
    "generalizing to curved spacetimes , buchbinder , gitman and pershin @xcite , following @xcite , proposed a simple lagrangian ( quadratic in the massive spin - two field , and also quadratic in derivatives ) which describes the causal propagation of the correct number of degrees of freedom of a neutral massive spin - two field in a fixed einstein background in arbitrary dimensions . in four bulk dimensions ,",
    "their lagrangian for @xmath10 , denoted by @xmath13 , reads @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the ricci scalar .",
    "also , we have defined @xmath16 .",
    "several comments are warranted here .",
    "first , it is crucial that the fixed background satisfies the einstein relation ( which , in four bulk dimensions , reads ) @xmath17 , with @xmath18 being the cosmological constant , otherwise some constraint equations become dynamical which would give rise to extra propagating degrees of freedom for @xmath10 . in our context",
    "this restriction simply implies that one should ignore the backreaction of @xmath10 , as well as other bulk fields that will be introduced later , on the metric of the fixed einstein background .",
    "second , in the flat spacetime limit , the above lagrangian becomes the fierz - pauli lagrangian @xcite .",
    "third , the massless limit of the bgp lagrangian , @xmath19 , has an emergent gauge symmetry ( diffeomorphism ) which is unique to the graviton : @xmath20 with @xmath21 being an infinitesimal vector .",
    "indeed , as pointed out in @xcite , this symmetry has been used to settle the ambiguity associated with the definition of the mass of @xmath10 .",
    "fourth , for @xmath22 ( here @xmath23 ) the above lagrangian has another emergent gauge symmetry @xcite : @xmath24 with @xmath25 being an infinitesimal scalar gauge parameter . in the following",
    ", we always assume that @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "excluding these two special values for the mass , the equations of motion and constraints obtained from are given by @xcite @xmath28 the above expressions give the correct number of propagating degrees of freedom for a massive spin - two field in ( 3 + 1)-dimensions .",
    "such a field transforms in the five - dimensional irreducible representation of so(3 ) , with so(3 ) being the little group of the lorentz group so(3,1 ) .",
    "as we alluded to earlier , in order to satisfy the constraint @xmath17 , we will work in a regime where matter fields do not backreact on the bulk geometry .",
    "so , we take the schwarzschild ads@xmath29 black hole as our background geometry ( @xmath30 )    @xmath31    where @xmath32 with @xmath33 being the horizon radius , given by the largest real root of @xmath34 .",
    "note that we are working in units where we set the curvature radius @xmath35 of ads@xmath29 equal to unity .",
    "also , note that in the coordinates we have chosen above , the asymptotic boundary of the spacetime is at @xmath36 .",
    "the temperature of the black hole is given by @xmath37 .",
    "to solve for @xmath10 , we only consider the configuration where @xmath38 for all @xmath39 . analyzing the equations  , one can show @xcite that it is consistent to put @xmath40 in the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 , with @xmath43 , is a symmetric traceless two - by - two matrix . defining the  director \" @xmath44 , under a rotation @xmath45 in the ( @xmath0,@xmath1)-plane , @xmath46 transforms as @xmath47 one can then choose a particular value of @xmath45 to set either @xmath48 or @xmath49 equal to zero , or make them equal .",
    "suppose now there exists a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional field theory dual to the gravitational setup under consideration here .",
    "focusing for the moment on the bulk neutral massive spin - two field @xmath10 , holography tells us that it should be dual to some operator in the boundary theory .",
    "since @xmath10 is a bulk field with spin greater than zero , its number of components does not naively match the number of components of the dual operator .",
    "but , as explained in @xcite , since @xmath10 can be put in the form , it is @xmath50 which sources a neutral symmetric traceless operator @xmath7 in the boundary theory .",
    "( the vev of the operator @xmath7 determines the nematicity of the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional boundary theory . )",
    "more concretely , equation implies that @xmath42 takes the following form near the boundary as @xmath36 @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 being symmetric traceless tensors .",
    "@xmath52 is the source for the boundary theory operator @xmath7 while @xmath53 is proportional to its vev , @xmath54 . in",
    ", @xmath55 denotes the uv scaling dimension of @xmath7 , which is related to the mass of the bulk field @xmath10 via @xmath56 note that for @xmath57 , when @xmath10 is the graviton , equation yields @xmath58 which is the dimension of @xmath59 , the energy - momentum tensor operator , of the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional boundary theory .",
    "there is a breitenlohner - freedman bound @xcite for the propagation of @xmath10 in an asymptotically ads@xmath29 geometry which reads @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "equation then implies that @xmath61 . in our discussions in this paper",
    ", we will always take the mass squared of @xmath10 in the asymptotic ads@xmath29 region of the geometry to satisfy the condition @xmath62 .",
    "note that the condition @xmath63 is then trivially satisfied .",
    "given the ansatz , we are interested in solutions in which @xmath40 , or rather @xmath42 , is regular near the horizon and normalizable as @xmath36 .",
    "more concretely , near the horizon , we look for a solution of the equation which is regular as @xmath64 , namely @xmath65 where the coefficient tensors @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 are all determined in terms of @xmath69 . in the boundary as @xmath70 , we demand @xmath42 to be normalizable @xmath71 if a solution with the above two boundary conditions exists , then the boundary theory would be in a phase where the neutral symmetric traceless operator @xmath7 ( which is the operator dual to @xmath50 ) spontaneously condenses .",
    "it is easy to show that given the set of equations ",
    ", such a solution does not exist .",
    "as we will explain in the next section , one way forward is to minimally modify the bgp lagrangian such that the new action yields the correct number of causal propagating degrees of freedom for @xmath10 , and also permits the aforementioned spontaneous condensation to occur .      undoubtedly , there are many ways to modify the bgp lagrangian to facilitate spontaneous condensation of the operator dual to @xmath10 . instead of categorizing all such modifications ,",
    "we take perhaps the simplest possibility .",
    "gubser @xcite has shown that coupling a neutral scalar field to the square of the weyl tensor leads to a scalar hair on an asymptotically flat schwarzschild black hole .",
    "this coupling is of interest here because the square of the weyl tensor vanishes at the boundary ( @xmath72 ) and hence does not affect the scaling dimension of the dual boundary operator . to this end , we modify the bgp lagrangian as follows @xmath73 with @xmath74 the weyl tensor . in the appendix , we show that the above modification to the bgp lagrangian , though not unique , offers a valid description of the neutral massive spin - two field @xmath10 , meaning that @xmath10 still propagates causally in a fixed einstein spacetime with the correct number of degrees of freedom . in what follows ,",
    "we show that the equations of motion for @xmath10 obtained from the new lagrangian now admits non - trivial normalizable solutions ( whose near horizon and asymptotic boundary behaviors are given by and , respectively ) .      from the appendix ,",
    "the relevant equation for determining whether there exists a normalizable solution for @xmath10 is @xmath75 note that the background metric must again satisfy the einstein relation .",
    "since we have taken the spacetime to be the schwarzschild ads@xmath29 black hole , the square of the weyl tensor is @xmath76 .",
    "one can easily show that , given the constraints presented in the appendix and the equation , it is again consistent to put @xmath10 in the form given in . notice that as shown above , the square of the weyl tensor evaluated on the background vanishes as @xmath36 .",
    "this then implies that the relationship between the asymptotic mass @xmath77 of @xmath50 and the uv dimension @xmath55 of the dual operator @xmath7 is still given by . also , the mass of @xmath50 in the asymptotic ads@xmath29 region satisfies the same breitenlohner - freedman bound as before .",
    "thus , regardless of the value of the coupling @xmath78 , the asymptotic ads@xmath29 region of the background remains stable .",
    "as figure [ conden ] illustrates , there exists a normalizable solution with @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "( we have used the gauge in to set @xmath81 . )",
    "the holographic interpretation of this normalizable solution is that @xmath7 has spontaneously condensed in the boundary theory . while it may be possible to obtain a normalizable solution for @xmath10 using an alternative mechanism",
    ", we believe that the details of how the dual operator condenses in the boundary theory should be irrelevant to the pomeranchuk instability as we discuss in the next section .",
    "-0.09 in , title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]      since we will be considering the boundary theory at a finite chemical potential @xmath82 for a u(1 ) charge , we need to introduce in the bulk an abelian gauge field @xmath83 with the lagrangian @xmath84 the equations of motion for @xmath85 is then @xmath86 we will only be interested in the case where @xmath87 is non - zero and , moreover , depends only on the radial coordinate @xmath88 .",
    "so , we take the ansatz @xmath89 . given our assumption that @xmath83 does not back react on the metric , the solution to is easily obtained to be @xmath90 where the boundary conditions at the horizon and the asymptotic boundary have been fixed by demanding @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "in this section , we study the shape distortion of the fermi surface as a result of the condensation of the boundary theory operator @xmath7 .",

    "the bulk spinor field @xmath93 is treated as a probe where its backreaction on the background metric , gauge field and neutral massive spin - two field is ignored .",
    "the dirac lagrangian , @xmath101 describes the bulk spinor field , where @xmath102 and @xmath103 and @xmath104 and @xmath105 being respectively the vielbein and the spin connection . also ,",

    "we ignore the terms which would just modify the mass of the spinor field .",
    "leaving aside those terms which would vanish once evaluated on the background , we focus on the leading - order that breaks parity in the boundary theory when the operator dual to @xmath10 condenses .",
