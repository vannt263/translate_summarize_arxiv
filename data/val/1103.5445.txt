    "events produced by new physics at the lhc often resemble events generated by standard model physics .",
    "this is especially true for signals involving multiple jets alongside a @xmath0 boson that decays to a lepton pair .",
    "these kinds of events most commonly arise from qcd emission in an electroweak process .",
    "such events could also be the result of cascade decays in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model , as well as in other models of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "they also emerge in top - quark pair production in its semileptonic decay mode , and in some higgs search modes .",
    "the qcd @xmath5 jets events pose a background to all of these signals .",
    "the superficial similarity of such signals to overwhelmingly larger backgrounds pushes us to find differences in various distributions , so as to impose cuts that suppress the standard - model backgrounds while retaining as much of the signals of new physics as possible .",
    "general underlying properties or principles that distinguish different sources of similar events are of particular importance . in this paper , we discuss one such general property , the large left - handed polarization of high-@xmath6 `` prompt '' @xmath2 and @xmath3 vector bosons produced directly in short - distance standard - model interactions  @xcite .",
    "this effect is distinct from the well - known  @xcite left - handed polarization of low-@xmath6 @xmath0 bosons moving primarily along the beam axis .",
    "the importance of -jet final states in hadron - collider searches has prompted intensive theoretical work over the last two decades .",
    "leading - order ( lo ) matrix - element generators have been available for some time  @xcite .",
    "more recently , they have been combined with parton - shower approaches using several matching techniques  @xcite , in order to provide event simulations which combine the correct wide - angle properties ( at lo ) with the detailed intrajet particle distributions required by experimenters .",
    "lo predictions , however , leave the overall normalization of event rates uncertain , an uncertainty that rises as the number of jets increases .",
    "obtaining quantitatively reliable predictions for -jet rates and distributions requires next - to - leading order ( nlo ) cross sections in qcd .",
    "the one - loop matrix elements entering nlo predictions stabilize the dependence on the unphysical renormalization and factorization scales , and provide predictions expected to be reliable to 1015% . until recently , calculating the required one - loop matrix elements posed a major difficulty , especially for final states with many jets ( and hence many partons ) .",
    "unitarity - based techniques have broken this bottleneck , and have allowed the prediction at nlo of vector - boson production with up to four associated jets  @xcite .",
    "these predictions do indeed possess greatly reduced overall normalization uncertainties .",
    "they also indicate where the lo predictions for shapes of distributions are reliable , and where they suffer corrections . for more than one associated jet ,",
    "the results are available at the parton level , and have not yet been incorporated into a matched parton - shower maintaining nlo accuracy .",
    "it was first observed in ref .",
    "@xcite that for -jet events at the lhc , both @xmath2 and @xmath3 bosons produced via standard - model interactions are preferentially polarized left - handed along their flight direction , beyond small transverse momenta .",
    "the polarization manifests itself in the decay spectra of the daughter leptons : left - handed @xmath2 bosons at a fixed boson @xmath7 produce larger neutrino transverse momentum ( missing @xmath8 ) and smaller charged lepton @xmath6 , in comparison with the decays of left - handed @xmath3 bosons .",
    "the polarization thus gives a characteristic shape to the ratios of the charged - lepton @xmath8 spectra , as shown in , between @xmath2 and @xmath3 production in association with three jets .",
    "( the precise setup used for this plot may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ; the key feature , a falling ratio with increasing @xmath8 , is generic . ) an opposite but similarly characteristic shape arises in the ratio of missing @xmath8 distributions for @xmath2 versus @xmath3 events .",
    "these ratio distributions are quite stable upon going from lo to nlo . ref .",
    "@xcite computed directly the left , right and longitudinal polarization fractions @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 for the case of -jet production at the lhc .",
    "the polarization fractions are quite stable over a range of @xmath0 transverse momenta , with @xmath9 of order 60% and rising slowly with @xmath7 , @xmath10 of order 25% , and the remaining longitudinal fraction @xmath11 dropping monotonically toward zero as @xmath7 increases .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath11 at large @xmath7 is dictated by the equivalence theorem  @xcite , because the goldstone modes can not couple to light quark lines .    in this paper",
    "we explore the dynamics behind the production of left - handed prompt @xmath0 bosons at finite transverse momentum at the lhc .",
    "we explain the underlying mechanism in terms of a combination of the left - handed nature of the charged - current weak interactions ( which allows only left - handed quarks to participate at lowest order ) , the domination of quarks over anti - quarks in the incoming protons , and the structure of the relevant helicity amplitudes .",
    "our earlier results  @xcite have prompted cms to undertake a measurement of @xmath0 boson polarization using the 2010 lhc data collected at @xmath12  tev  @xcite .",
    "here we provide theoretical predictions relevant to this measurement , which require a minimum @xmath7 of 50  gev , but no explicit requirement of additional jets .",
    "we apply no explicit cuts on the lepton transverse momenta or rapidity ; and no lepton isolation cuts either .",
    "the experiments do , of course , make such cuts  the detectors have finite size and cracks , and triggers impose implicit lepton @xmath6 cuts .",
    "cms has corrected its measured data for the effects of the lepton cuts .",
    "the actual cuts used , combined with the lack of knowledge of the longitudinal component of the neutrino momentum , lead to a dependence of the extracted fractions @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 on other components of the full @xmath0 boson spin density matrix .",
    "the diagonal elements of the density matrix ( essentially @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) are coefficients of functions that depend only on the polar angle @xmath13 of the charged lepton in the @xmath0 rest frame , with respect to the @xmath0 flight direction as observed in the lab frame .",
    "the neutrino will of course come out at an angle @xmath14 in this frame .",
    "the off - diagonal elements arise from the interference of amplitudes for different @xmath0 helicity states , and they depend on an azimuthal angle @xmath15 .",
    "they would integrate to zero if the experimental acceptance were uniform in @xmath15 , but it is not . accordingly , theoretical information about the @xmath15 dependence , and its uncertainty , is needed in order to extract @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the full @xmath0 spin density matrix has been studied previously in several theoretical papers  @xcite .",
    "two of the additional coefficients were measured by cdf during run i of the tevatron  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we compute the diagonal and off - diagonal elements of the density matrix as a function of the @xmath0 boson transverse momentum at the lhc at @xmath16  tev , expressed as asymmetry coefficients @xmath17 of various angular distributions .",
    "we perform the computation at lo and at nlo , _",
    "i.e. _  fixed - order and parton level , using blackhat  @xcite in conjunction with sherpa  @xcite .",
    "we also use sherpa  to provide a parton - shower prediction matched to tree - level matrix elements , also known as matrix - element - plus - truncated - shower ( me+ps ) .",
    "( our parton - shower results do not include hadronization effects , but remain at the parton level . )",
    "we find that the corrections from lo to nlo are fairly small .",
    "we also find that varying the factorization and renormalization scale in a correlated way in the numerator and denominator of the ratios entering the @xmath17 gives very small changes , so small that it does not provide a sensible measure of the theoretical uncertainty .",
    "we have studied the dependence of the @xmath17 on the parton distributions , using the error sets provided by cteq  @xcite , and find it to be small as well .",
    "we ascribe the principal theoretical uncertainty to the difference between the nlo and me+ps results .",
    "this difference is typically of order 10% for the larger @xmath17 coefficients , including @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "( the uncertainties from the choice of parton distributions are significantly smaller . )",
    "some of the @xmath17 coefficients are quite small in magnitude , presumably due to cancellations between different types of terms . in this case",
    "the percentage difference between nlo and me+ps can be significantly larger .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in",
    "we give arguments why @xmath0 bosons are predominantly left - handed at the lhc . in we define the polarization more precisely and explain how we compute it .",
    "our results are presented in . in",
    "we give our conclusions .",
    "in this section we will explain why both @xmath2 and @xmath3 bosons produced at the lhc are dominantly polarized left - handed when they emerge with large transverse momentum .",
    "we will start with a heuristic explanation based on angular momentum conservation , and then proceed to refine the explanation further .",
    "a fully quantitative description requires a numerical calculation , which we present in .    before considering the case of @xmath0 production with transverse momentum , we discuss the simpler and well - known example of @xmath0 polarization along the beam axis , for @xmath0 bosons produced with little or no transverse momentum  @xcite . here",
    "the principal production mechanism involves the leading - order partonic subprocesses @xmath18 and @xmath19 . at leading order ,",
    "the @xmath0 moves strictly along the beam axis , with no transverse momentum , @xmath20 .",
    "suppose the @xmath0 is moving in the direction of the initial - state quark , as opposed to the anti - quark .",
    "this is likely to be the case at the lhc , because the lhc is a @xmath1 machine and the quark distributions @xmath21 have a larger average momentum fraction @xmath22 than the antiquark distributions @xmath23 .",
    "because the electroweak charged current is purely - left - handed , the quark must be left - handed and the anti - quark right - handed .",
    "( we assume massless quarks and leptons throughout this paper . ) by angular momentum conservation , the spin of the @xmath0 is 100% left - handed along its direction of motion , for either @xmath2 or @xmath3 , as shown in .",
    "this effect is diluted some by anti - quarks that occasionally carry a larger @xmath22 than the quarks with which they collide .",
    "however , the dilution is small at large rapidities , because the ratio @xmath24 increases rapidly as @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath0 polarization is analyzed with 100% analyzing power through its leptonic decay .",
    "a left - handed @xmath2 tends to decay with the left - handed neutrino forward ( along its direction of motion ) and the right - handed positron backward .",
    "a left - handed @xmath3 tends to put the left - handed electron forward and the right - handed anti - neutrino backward .",
    "note that at the tevatron , a @xmath26 collider , the same basic physics of valence quark domination and angular momentum conservation causes the @xmath2 bosons , which typically move in the proton direction , to be primarily left - handed .",
    "however , the @xmath3 bosons , which typically move in the anti - proton direction , usually arise from a right - handed @xmath27 anti - quark from the anti - proton annihilating with a left - handed @xmath28 quark from the proton ; hence the @xmath3 bosons are predominantly right - handed at the tevatron .",
    "this polarization implies that both @xmath2 and @xmath3 bosons tend to decay so that the charged leptons are more central than the parent bosons , producing the well - known dilution of the @xmath0 boson charge asymmetry , when it is measured via the charged - lepton rapidity distribution .",
    "next consider the case in which the @xmath0 boson does carry transverse momentum .",
    "for definiteness , we take the @xmath0 to be a @xmath2 ; the case of a @xmath3 is qualitatively the same . at leading order ,",
    "there are three possible subprocesses : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "these subprocesses are all related to each other by crossing symmetry . for events with a sufficiently large @xmath0 transverse momentum ,",
    "the soft - gluon enhancement of @xmath30 is not that important , and the hierarchy of subprocess contributions is set by the hierarchy of relevant parton distributions for typical values of @xmath22 .",
    "now , @xmath22 increases with @xmath7 ; at sufficiently large @xmath22 , @xmath32 , which leads to the subprocess hierarchy ,  >   >   , [ subprocesshierarchy ] once we include the convolution with parton distributions in the quantities in . even at more moderate @xmath7 ( smaller @xmath22 ) , where the second hierarchy might be small , or even reversed",
    ", the first one should still hold .",
    "( kom and stirling  @xcite have found that at lo the fraction of subprocesses in -jet production that are initiated by the @xmath33 channel ( plus @xmath34 ) is around 7080% . )",
    "consider the @xmath0 polarization produced by the dominant subprocess , @xmath29 .",
    "the analysis is more complicated than in the case of production along the beam axis , because two different axes are involved , the beamline and the @xmath0 flight direction . in this section only , to simplify the analysis we define the @xmath0 flight direction using the partonic center - of - mass frame .",
    "( in subsequent sections we will use the lab frame ; at very high @xmath7 there is not much difference between these choices . )",
    "there are two feynman graphs for this process , shown in , the @xmath35-channel graph on the left and the @xmath36-channel graph on the right .",
    "we first give an heuristic argument that the @xmath0 is left - handed , based on angular momentum conservation along the @xmath0 flight direction .",
    "suppose for a moment that we could neglect the @xmath36-channel graph .",
    "then the subprocess would involve an off - shell spin-1/2 @xmath37-quark , which decays to an on - shell , left - handed @xmath28 quark recoiling against the @xmath0 boson . in this case",
    "it is impossible for the @xmath0 boson to be right - handed , because the total angular momentum along the @xmath0@xmath28 axis would then be @xmath38 , which can not be carried by the spin-1/2 off - shell quark .",
    "also , the longitudinal mode of the @xmath0 is suppressed for large transverse momenta , @xmath39 , by the equivalence theorem which relates this mode to the goldstone boson , which does not couple to massless fermions .",
    "thus we could argue that the @xmath0 boson is 100% left - handed at large @xmath7 if only we could neglect the @xmath36-channel graph .",
    "in fact , this argument is true when the incoming gluon is left - handed . to see this",
    ", we choose the gluon polarization vector so that the @xmath36-channel graph in vanishes .",
    "this graph contains a factor of @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a weyl spinor for the outgoing @xmath28 quark momentum @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the polarization vector for the gluon with momentum @xmath44 .",
    "we use a spinor - helicity representation for this polarization vector , in terms of a reference momentum / spinor @xmath45 . contracting with @xmath46 yields the gluon polarization bi - spinors , ^+(k_g , q ) & = & , [ slashpolgluerout ] + ^-(k_g , q ) & = & - , [ slashpolgluelout ] using a standard all - outgoing labeling of the gluon helicity @xmath47 , where we dropped terms that vanish when contracted with a left - handed @xmath28 or @xmath37 spinor . for a left - handed incoming gluon , as shown in ( a ) , we are instructed to use . in this case",
    "the @xmath36-channel graph is proportional to @xmath48 .",
    "we are now free to choose the reference spinor @xmath49 , so that @xmath50 and thus the @xmath36-channel graph vanishes .",
    "although this is a specific gauge choice , it allows us to argue that the @xmath0 should be 100% left - handed when the incoming gluon is left - handed , at least at very large @xmath7 , and when the @xmath0 spin is analyzed along the @xmath0 flight direction , as measured in the partonic center - of - mass frame .",
    "we will see in a moment that this statement is true even at lower @xmath7 .",
    "the purely left - handed @xmath0 polarization is indicated by a long downward - pointing vertical arrow next to the @xmath0 in ( a ) .",
    "in contrast , when the incoming gluon is right - handed , as in ( b ) , we use for the gluon polarization bi - spinor .",
    "now @xmath51 enters a more complicated spinor string , and we can not make the @xmath36-channel graph vanish by a simple choice of @xmath45 .",
    "( we could make the @xmath35-channel graph vanish if we wanted to , but that would not help in an angular - momentum - based argument . ) in accordance with this obstruction , the outgoing @xmath0 now can have any of the three possible helicities .",
    "we will see shortly that when the @xmath0 transverse momentum becomes large , its polarization is dominantly right - handed . the indefinite @xmath0 polarization , but transitioning to right - handed ,",
    "is indicated by a short arrow angling upward , next to the @xmath0 in ( b ) .",
    "the reason the right - handed @xmath0 polarization in case ( b ) does not wash out the left - handed polarization in case ( a ) at large transverse momenta is because the magnitude of its squared matrix element is only about @xmath52 the size of the one in case ( a ) .",
    "this smaller weighting leads to an estimated asymptotic polarization , at very large @xmath0 transverse momentum , of roughly 80% left - handed and 20% right - handed . in this limit ,",
    "the left - handed @xmath0 bosons all come from left - handed gluons , and the right - handed ones are all from right - handed gluons .",
    "we will see later in the paper that the actual @xmath0 polarizations predicted , at transverse momenta accessible at the lhc , are remarkably close to this asymptotic value .",
    "the leading - order amplitudes for the three subprocesses in are all related by crossing symmetry .",
    "after decaying the @xmath0 to a lepton pair , @xmath53 , they can all be written simply in terms of spinor products , ^_(a ) & & d^lo_(a ) ( k_dk_)^2 , [ casea ] + a^_(b ) & & d^lo_(b ) ( k_uk_e)^2 , [ caseb ] where we dropped coupling and propagator factors common to the two cases .",

    "this is also the angle between the @xmath28 quark and neutrino directions .",
    "this angular dependence implies the purely left - handed @xmath0 boson polarization mentioned above .",
    "in contrast , for ( b ) , the factor of @xmath57 does not lead to a net left - handed polarization .",
    "it correlates the positron direction with the incoming beam direction rather than with the outgoing @xmath0 flight direction . in the limit of large transverse momentum , when one boosts from the parton center - of - mass frame to the @xmath0 rest frame",
    ", the incoming @xmath37 quark and gluon are almost parallel , and their spatial momentum adds up to give the outgoing @xmath28 quark momentum . if the scattering angle is @xmath58 in the center - of - mass frame , then the magnitude of the @xmath37 quark momentum is precisely half that of the @xmath28 quark , in the @xmath0 rest frame .",
    "then the numerator factor @xmath57 in yields the opposite polarization from @xmath54 in , but only at @xmath52 the rate , _",
    "i.e. _  it is proportional to @xmath59 .",
    "a partonic scattering angle of @xmath58 kinematically maximizes @xmath7 at fixed parton center - of - mass energy , _",
    "i.e. _  at fixed @xmath60 for @xmath61 . however , the matrix element prefers a smaller scattering angle ( the @xmath28 quark more parallel to the incoming gluon ) , while the parton densities prefer @xmath62 , which further skews the preferred kinematics .",
    "hence the 80% value for @xmath9 that is implied by @xmath58 scattering is just an estimate for asymptotically large @xmath7 .    at finite @xmath0 transverse momentum , we find that the polarization fractions for @xmath58 @xmath63 scattering in case ( b ) are , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the angle that the @xmath37 quark makes with the @xmath28 quark in the @xmath0 rest frame . in terms of the boost of the @xmath0 boson in the partonic center - of - mass frame , @xmath66",

    "[ sinthetau ] at @xmath58 , the overall weighting of this helicity configuration , with respect to case ( a ) , is @xmath67 . from these relations",
    "one can estimate the lo polarization fractions from this subprocess at finite @xmath7 .",
    "the subprocess @xmath30 shown in is subdominant to @xmath29 , but it can be analyzed similarly using . in both cases the decay leptons are correlated with the beam direction . at large @xmath0 transverse momenta ,",
    "case ( a ) yields mainly left - handed @xmath0 bosons , while ( b ) yields mainly right - handed ones ( as indicated by the arrows next to the @xmath0s in the figure ) . for @xmath58 scattering ,",

    "finally , the subprocess @xmath68 is shown in .",
    "it produces a net right - handed @xmath0 polarization , from configuration ( b ) , because the factor @xmath57 is proportional to @xmath69 .",
    "however , it is suppressed compared to the dominant source of left - handed polarization in ( a ) , because @xmath70 except at quite small @xmath22 .    we have argued that the @xmath0 polarization should reach about 80% left - handed and 20% right - handed at asymptotically large @xmath0 transverse momentum . however , there are a number of reasons why the left - handed fraction should be smaller at finite @xmath7 :    1 .",

    "the subdominant @xmath71 and @xmath72 channels dilute the polarization .",
    "the dilution decreases as @xmath22 increases , _",

    "this explains why the @xmath9 term is proportional to @xmath97 for @xmath2 .",

    "following similar logic as for the previous case , in which the azimuthal angle has been integrated out , we may extract the angular coefficients @xmath17 directly in terms of expectation values , @xmath120 for either lo or me+ps , the coefficients @xmath121 vanish , because the functions they multiply are odd under a `` naive '' time - reversal symmetry , as well as under parity , either of which maps @xmath122 .",
    "they do receive contributions at nlo in qcd from the absorptive part of one - loop amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath7 distribution of these contributions is highly suppressed at the lhc .",
    "the left panel of shows that the @xmath123 coefficient is well below 0.01 , and indeed is consistent with zero , within integration errors due to sampling fluctuations .",

    "instead , we use the difference between the nlo and me+ps predictions as a measure of the uncertainty .",
    "the two frameworks have competing strengths .",
    "the nlo result benefits from true virtual corrections and a better cancellation of scale dependence in the overall cross section .",
    "the me+ps result includes the effects of radiating multiple soft gluons .",

    "me+ps event samples are produced according to the technique described in ref .",
    "this method combines two essentially different approaches to perturbative qcd , hard matrix element calculations , which are exact at some fixed perturbative order ( lo in our case ) and parton showers , which resum logarithmic corrections due to bremsstrahlung effects . the parton shower employed to this end in sherpa  @xcite is based on catani - seymour dipole factorization  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to earlier parton showers , the model inherently respects qcd soft color coherence , as the eikonal factors associated with soft - gluon emission off a color dipole are exactly mapped onto two dipole functions , which differ only in the assignment of emitter and spectator partons .",
    "additionally , the model allows the unambiguous identification of a recoil partner for partons that are shifted off mass - shell in the splitting process ( the `` mother '' partons ) , thereby eliminating one of the major sources of uncertainty in earlier schemes for parton evolution .",

    "although this component rises initially , by 150  gev it stabilizes between @xmath140 to @xmath141 for the @xmath2 case . for the @xmath3 case , it is a bit higher . for @xmath10",
    "the nlo predictions are a bit lower than the lo and me+ps ones . in any case , to compensate for these rises , the longitudinal component @xmath11 falls rapidly with increasing @xmath7 , as illustrated in . as mentioned previously , the decline of @xmath11 is due to the equivalence theorem .",
    "a rather striking feature of these plots is how small the difference is between the @xmath3 and @xmath2 cases , showing that the effect is essentially the same for both signs .",
    "another interesting plot is the left - handed polarization fraction @xmath9 as a function of @xmath7 , but with different rapidity cuts imposed on the vector - boson @xmath142 . in",

    ", the effect of the @xmath147 cut has essentially disappeared ; and by a transverse momentum of 350 gev , the effect of any rapidity cut has essentially disappeared .",
    "this demonstrates that the large polarization at high @xmath7 comes from central rapidities .",
    "one could impose a rapidity cut on the @xmath0 boson in order to separate the beam - axis polarization effect from the transverse one at all vector - boson transverse momenta .",
    "finally in , we compare the five @xmath17 coefficients for the cases of @xmath2 and @xmath3 using nlo qcd .",
    "up to sign flips for @xmath148 and @xmath149 we see little difference between the two cases , as a function of @xmath7 .",

    "prompt @xmath0 vector bosons of both signs , when produced at moderate to high transverse momentum at the lhc , are predominantly polarized left - handedly  @xcite . in this paper , we presented a detailed study of this phenomenon and of its underyling mechanism .",
    "the effect , which superficially appears to violate cp , actually arises from a combination of the left - handed nature of the electroweak charged - current interaction , the prevalence of valence quarks in the @xmath1 initial state ( which is not charge - conjugation invariant ) , and properties of the short - distance matrix elements .",
    "we found that a simple estimate , assuming @xmath58 scattering in the partonic center - of - mass for the dominant process @xmath151 , leads to 80% left - handed polarization for @xmath0 bosons at large @xmath7 .",
    "this high degree of polarization is somewhat reduced by kinematic effects in this subprocess , as well as dilution from other subprocesses , especially at lower @xmath7 .",
    "nevertheless , with a cut of @xmath152  gev we find that most @xmath0 bosons are left - handed , and the remainder are split between right - handed and longitudinal states .",
    "as @xmath7 increases , the left - handed polarization fraction can rise as high as 70% .",
    "this is remarkably close to the simple upper estimate of 80% .",
    "the @xmath83 boson polarization is similar , though a bit smaller at around 60% , due to dilution from right - handed @xmath37 quarks in the initial state .",
    "the effect in @xmath83 decays will be harder to see experimentally , however , as the analyzing power in decays to charged leptons is only about 15% ( versus 100% for @xmath86 ) .",
    "we studied the polarization dominance using lo , nlo and me+ps qcd calculations .",
    "the effect is theoretically robust , and higher - order qcd corrections are small .",
    "the difference between nlo and me+ps predictions suggests a 10% theoretical uncertainty in the polarization fractions . it should be possible in the future to improve the predictions , when there are no tagged jets , or even one tagged jet , in at least two ways .",

    "second , the computation of -jet production at nnlo in qcd may become feasible before long  @xcite , making it possible to study the polarization observables at one higher order in @xmath135 .",
    "we provided numerical tables and plots for the polarization fractions and compared to the recent preliminary measurement by the cms collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with this initial measurement , given its relatively sizable uncertainties .",
    "more detailed comparisons will be possible with increased data sets from the ongoing run of the lhc",
    ".    it may also be possible to use the @xmath0 polarization phenomenon as a probe of polarized gluon distribution functions , if a sufficient number of @xmath0 bosons can be produced at moderate transverse momentum in polarized proton collisions .",
    "asymmetries in inclusive ( low @xmath7 ) @xmath0 boson production in polarized @xmath1 collisions have recently been studied at rhic  @xcite .",
    "the large left - handed polarization of prompt vector bosons at high - transverse momentum is a robust theoretical prediction , stable against both qcd corrections and the emission of additional jets .",
    "it leads to very different distributions for the positively and negatively charged decay leptons , as well as for the neutrinos .",
    "the situation for top - quark pair production is very different .",
    "the initial state is predominantly all - gluon , and hence cp - invariant , so no such asymmetry is possible .",
    "while top quark decay produces @xmath2 bosons that are about 70% longitudinal , 30% left - handed , the @xmath3 bosons from @xmath153 decay are 70% longitudinal ,",
    "30% right - handed , so in this case the positively and negatively charged leptons have very similar distributions . the decay to @xmath154 pairs of a heavy higgs boson ( sufficiently heavy to decay to moderately high-@xmath6 @xmath0 bosons )",
    "is another signal process which should not display single-@xmath0 asymmetries , because of the spin-0 nature of the higgs boson .",

    "<S> the production of @xmath0 bosons in association with jets is an important background to new physics at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> events in which the @xmath0 carries large transverse momentum and decays leptonically lead to large missing energy and are of particular importance . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the left - handed nature of the @xmath0 coupling , combined with valence quark domination at a @xmath1 machine , leads to a large left - handed polarization for both @xmath2 and @xmath3 bosons at large transverse momenta . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization fractions are very stable with respect to qcd corrections . </S>",
    "<S> the leptonic decay of the @xmath4 bosons translates the common left - handed polarization into a strong asymmetry in transverse momentum distributions between positrons and electrons , and between neutrinos and anti - neutrinos ( missing transverse energy ) . </S>",
    "<S> such asymmetries may provide an effective experimental handle on separating @xmath0+jets from top quark production , which exhibits very little asymmetry due to c invariance , and from various types of new physics .    </S>",
