    "the notion that solar coronal loops are heated as an end result of magnetic braiding dates back to the 1970s and parker s notion of topological dissipation @xcite .",
    "the hypothesis is built on the foundation that the solar corona can be modelled as a largely force - free environment , with the lorentz forces in force balance .",
    "however , loops themselves are subject to photospheric motions at their footpoint and hence slow footpoint motions will lead to the quasi - static evolution of loops through sequences of force - free equilibria .",
    "complex footpoint motions applied to the base of a coronal loop will twist and tangle the magnetic field which must then relax to a force - free state . given the extremely high lundquist numbers of the corona",
    "the relaxation will be ideal and so will preserve exactly the magnetic field topology .",
    "the question is then whether a magnetic field of arbitrary topology can relax ideally to a smooth force - free equilibrium .",
    "parker hypothesised that the space of force - free fields is restricted , so that smooth equilibria will not generally exist and , instead , the magnetic field will develop tangential discontinuities corresponding to current sheets @xcite .",
    "of course in a real corona as soon as sufficiently small length scales develop then diffusion will locally become appreciable and a change in the magnetic topology can occur , releasing energy .",
    "this release of magnetic energy , built up through braiding , could , under the parker hypothesis , explain the observed high temperatures of coronal loops .",
    "observing braided magnetic fields in the corona has so far been fraught with difficulty .",
    "although a very few observations ( such as those of figure  [ fig : trace ] ) suggest large - scale magnetic fields can have braided configurations , most observations of coronal loops show an apparently well - combed structure .",
    "the latest high - resolution images from hi - c are more suggestive of braids @xcite , although how the apparently crossing structures relate to the underlying magnetic field is not immediately clear @xcite .",
    "a non - linear force - free extrapolation of the region @xcite does suggest a complex structure .",
    "although the extrapolated magnetic field outlines the crossings seen in the observations , it is also constructed from lower - resolution magnetograms .",
    "furthermore , the flux tube determined is split along its length which can only be the result of at least one coronal null point . a null point in such a coronal volume",
    "is expected from our current understanding of the structure of coronal fields : they are known to be permeated by nulls , separatrix surfaces and separators @xcite . a review in this volume @xcite discusses the significance of heating at these features , which was already acknowledged by parker : _ `` insofar as the field is concentrated into separate individual magnetic fibrils at the photosphere , each individual fibril moves independently of its neighbors , producing tangential discontinuities ( current sheets ) ... there is , however , a more basic effect , viz .",
    ", a continuous mapping of the footpoints spontaneously produces tangential discontinuities '' _ @xcite . accordingly , braiding as discussed in this review refers specifically to the elementary effect in individual elemental loops .",
    "these loops are not resolved by current instruments and , given their aspect ratio , fine scale braiding within a loop would likely appear smoothed out .",
    "the notion of footpoint motions acting on the complex coronal field with all of its topological features has been formalised into the theory of coronal tectonics @xcite .",
    "simulations addressing this relevant scenario are so far rare , with just a very few examining the basic effect @xcite . one important series of articles implicitly fall into this framework @xcite . here a potential magnetic field is extrapolated into the corona from a smoothed active region magnetogram and a convection - like driving velocity applied to its simulated photospheric boundary . although the resolution of these large - scale simulations is not sufficient to provide an understanding of exactly where or how the dissipation is occurring , the broad comparisons to observed loops are encouraging .",
    "an understanding of the viability of the parker mechanism for coronal heating requires an two - pronged attack both by theory and by direct numerical simulation , while this review discusses only the latter approach . as we will detail in section  [ sec : overview ] , numerical evidence does not , at least to date , demonstrate the ubiquitous formation of singular current sheets .",
    "nevertheless , simulations all agree that small scales in the current do rapidly develop under generic braiding conditions and these will eventually become small enough to initiate dissipation . hence a second main question to be tackled by braiding simulations arises : given a finite resistivity , how does the coronal magnetic field evolve when it is continuously driven by photospheric motions ?",
    "a discussion of the main simulations tackling these various questions is given in section  [ sec : overview ] , presented in four broad classes according to simulation setup .",
    "conclusions are briefly drawn in section  [ sec : conclusions ] together with an outline of some suggestions for future work .",
    "numerical simulations of flux braiding naturally divide into four categories . these are not all distinct , with some simulations falling into more than one category .",
    "nevertheless the division is helpful to describe the present state of knowledge . in brief , the groups of simulations are :    * _ sequences of shears_. a loop is subjected to a sequence of simple shearing motions on the boundary . + * _ continually driven systems_. a loop is subjected to boundary motions , generally of rotational form , for an extended period of time . + * _ formation of discontinuities_. the question of whether or not tangential discontinuities form in a coronal volume subjected to boundary motion is examined by simulation . + * _ initially braided fields_. the coronal volume is not braided self - consistently via boundary motions but a braided magnetic field is taken as an initial condition for a simulation .",
    "each of the simulations discussed in this review have a broadly similar experimental setup .",
    "to model the coronal loop the magnetic field is straightened out to lie between two parallel plates . hence a cartesian geometry is employed and in the numerical box both the upper and lower boundaries represent the photosphere . a velocity field imposed on one or both boundaries represents a photospheric flow .",
    "the flow is two  dimensional and flux emergence ( or cancellation ) is not considered .",
    "we detail results found for simulations in each of the classes given above in the following sections , beginning with the earliest form of simulation , that of boundary shear .",

    "throughout this section , the term shearing flow is used to describe one running on opposite directions on either side of a neutral flow line .",
    "van ballegooijen @xcite was the first to describe such a simulation , applying a shearing flow on the lower boundary of the domain in an alternating sequence of perpendicular directions ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath7 , etc . ) with differing , randomly chosen , phase angles .",
    "the flow amplitude and duration were each chosen such that the maximum displacement of fluid elements on the boundary is around @xmath9 of the domain size .",
    "the mapping of magnetic field lines from lower to upper boundary is shown to develop fine scales in the evolution , with the scales decreasing exponentially with number of shear events @xcite .",
    "although this work was developed before the concept of the quasi - separatrix layer ( qsl ) was developed @xcite , the idea is essentially the same : qsls in the domain have a thickness exponentially decreasing in time .",
    "fluid displacements on the upper boundary after 5 shears are shown in the left - hand image of figure  [ fig : vb88 ] .",
    "the corresponding volume force - free magnetic field was obtained following each boundary displacement using an energy minimisation iterative procedure on a @xmath10 numerical grid @xcite . using this approach a total of five shears",
    "were successfully applied before the method itself failed . while it is not _ a priori _ clear that the existence of small scales in the magnetic field line mapping also forces the magnetic field and current to have the same small scales , this does turn out to be the case in the example presented @xcite .",
    "hence the length scales of the current also exponentially decrease with number of shears .",
    "the current structure after 5 shears is shown in the right - hand image of figure  [ fig : vb88 ] .",
    "miki , schnack & van hoven @xcite took a similar approach , again applying a shear sequence to the lower boundary of a unit cube containing a magnetic field . their numerical scheme",
    ", a simplification of the ideal mhd equations that neglects the inertial term and employs a high viscosity , allows for a successive sequence of 12 force - free relaxations on a @xmath1 grid to be calculated .",
    "the main findings of van ballegooijen @xcite were confirmed , with the cascade to smaller scales giving an exponential growth in current density but with a smooth force - free equilibrium achieved in each step .",
    "a consequence of the exponential decrease in current layer thickness with shear is that a tangential discontinuity will only be reached after an infinite time .",
    "however , in practice current densities will be strong enough to become dynamically important in a plasma of finite resistivity .    while the shears applied in @xcite all have a low amplitude ( @xmath11 of the domain size ) , longbottom _ et al . _",
    "@xcite considered the question of how the shear amplitude itself ( rather than number of shears ) might affect the field evolution .",
    "the authors employed an ideal magnetofrictional relaxation method @xcite , and applied shearing motions on both the upper and lower boundaries of the domain .",
    "the initially uniform magnetic field on the unit cube was first subjected to a shear of amplitude 0.8 ( as a fraction of the domain size ) and then relaxed to a force - free state that was found to be smooth .",
    "this state was taken as an initial condition for a parameter study in which a perpendicular shear of various strengths was applied before relaxation .",
    "the amplitude of the second shear is shown to be crucial in determining the nature of the final force - free state . in all cases",
    "a twisted current structure is found running through the domain .",
    "the basic structure of the twisted current layer was confirmed by bowness _",
    "@xcite who imposed analytically an initial shear and then used an ideal 3d mhd code at @xmath5 to evolve the magnetic field through a second , perpendicular , shear event .",
    "taking a second shear strength of 0.5 a twisted current layer forms ( figure 11(a ) and figure  14 of @xcite ) running through the domain , agreeing with @xcite .",
    "the width of the current layer depends on shear strength @xcite : for low shear values ( below 0.5 ) the layer is well resolved while for high shear ( above 0.6 ) its behaviour is consistent with that of a true tangential discontinuity .",
    "that is , the maximum current in the layer increases linearly or faster as the grid resolution is increased ( power law growth is expected for a true current sheet @xcite ) . the simulation of longbottom _ et al . _",
    "@xcite marks the first ( and essentially only ) demonstration of a case that is consistent with parker scenario of topological dissipation @xcite . with the resolution available at that time ( a lagrangian grid of maximum size @xmath2 ) and known inaccuracies in the scheme for high grid deformation @xcite",
    ", the possibility remains that the growth of maximum current with resolution in the high shear cases could level off at higher resolutions .",
    "an increase in grid size has only very recently become accessible @xcite and this possibility is , as - yet , untested .    under either of these aforementioned scenarios ( an exponential decrease in current thickness or the formation of singular current layers in ideal mhd ) in a real physical plasma",
    "the resistivity will at some point become important . to determine the consequences of a finite resistivity , galsgaard & nordlund @xcite employed a fully resistive 3d mhd simulation to examine behaviour of a coronal loop continually subjected to boundary shearing motions .",
    "the authors detail an extensive set of simulations , common to all of which is the application of perpendicular shears of random amplitude , phase and duration to both the upper and lower boundaries of the model loop .",
    "runs consider the effect of driver speed ( @xmath12 compared with the alfvn speed of 1 ) and duration , loop aspect ratio , and grid resolution ( @xmath13 ) , with all runs extending for many alfvn loop crossing times .",
    "some results are common to each of the simulations in @xcite : shearing motions cause a rapid growth in the electric current ( with maximum strength increasing exponentially in the early phase ) , dissipation becomes important and within two or three shears a statistically steady state is reached where quantities ( including the maximum current and total magnetic energy ) fluctuate about an average level . in such steady states",
    "the current structure is fragmented with joule dissipation taking place over a wide range of scales .",

    "the magnetic field structure ( some example field lines are shown in figure  [ fig : gn96 ] ) is generally complex , including reversals in the field component perpendicular to the driven boundaries .",
    "no significant twist is built up in the system but magnetic energy in excess of potential in the steady states varies significantly .",
    "the key factor appears to be the boundary driving velocity : for the 1:10 aspect ratio loop the mean energy in excess of potential in the statistically steady states is just 1.5% for the slower driver of at a 0.02 fraction of the alfvn velocity but 45% for the faster driver at a 0.2 fraction of the alfvn velocity .",

    "the idea differs from previous simulations in that , rather than starting with a uniform magnetic field and braiding it through boundary motions , the initial configuration is already braided @xcite ( chosen as an analytical expression where some magnetic field lines have a pigtail braid topology while more generally field lines show a complex continuum of connectivities ) . overall the configuration has no helicity , being built up from an equal number of positive and negative twists .",

    "these layers then fragment and a complex network of current layers with a volume filling effect is formed ( figure  [ fig : braidj ] ) .",
    "magnetic reconnection taking place across these layers allows the magnetic field to simplify and form an equilibrium state consisting of two unlinked flux tubes of opposite twist , associated with large scale currents ( figure  [ fig : braidj ] , right - most image ) @xcite .",
    "thus , although helicity is very well conserved , relaxation is not to the expected taylor state , limiting the magnetic energy release @xcite .",
    "the braiding is found to be associated with a homogeneous loop heating @xcite .",
    "by contrast a comparison case of a more coherent braided field , constructed from twisting motions of only one sign , was examined and found to lead to more localised but stronger heating @xcite .",

    "the fields , not themselves in equilibrium , are constructed by superimposing a perpendicular field component made up of large scale fourier modes to the background uniform field , so creating a braided loop ( taken with aspect ratio @xmath49 ) . the loop evolution was found to depend on the ratio , @xmath50 , between the root mean square amplitude of the initial perpendicular field and the background field . for @xmath51",

    "the emerging consensus from flux braiding experiments is that thin but non - singular current layers form as coronal loops are subjected to braiding motions and that the width of these layers decreases exponentially in time . with photospheric motions continually but slowly braiding",
    "the coronal volume dissipation is an inevitable consequence . in simulations where systems have a finite resistivity and",
    "are subjected to footpoint motions over a long period of time statistically steady states are reached where dissipation and magnetic energy fluctuate strongly in time about an average level .",
    "although the poynting flux into the corona must balance over a long time ( with short - term decoupling present in simulations ) the flux is itself dependent on the state of the coronal field .",
    "how exactly heating depends on the nature of the photospheric motions and on the coronal resistivity is not well understood .",
    "a number of ideas arise for future attacks on the braiding problem .",
    "one is to update the simulation approach to the singularity question of parker using improved computational techniques .",
    "for example , the magnetofrictional relaxation scheme , previously known to have numerical inaccuracies , has been significantly improved and at the same time parallelised so that simulations with an order of magnitude higher resolution are possible @xcite .    for the case",
    "where loops are continually subjected to boundary motions a more detailed examination with systematic simulation setup is required to determine what exactly are the important factors in determining the level and nature of the loop heating . before tackling this with a reduced mhd approach a careful comparison of reduced mhd with fully 3d mhd could perhaps be fruitful .    in a move towards increased realism",
    "a basic question is how the corona can be braided when a realistic loop is modelled .",
    "part of this is to take a representative stratified atmosphere , with important initial advances recently presented by van ballegooijen _",
    "additionally one should recall that the real corona is full of topological structure so that how coronal fields are braided when the magnetic carpet is included , i.e.  simulations addressing the coronal tectonics hypothesis @xcite , is another task for the near future . similarly along these lines",
    "the ever - increasing computing power should allow a better resolution of large - scale simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) so that their relation to braiding and coronal tectonics can be more completely established .",
