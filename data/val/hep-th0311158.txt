    "de sitter ( ds ) spacetime is the maximally symmetric solution of einsten s equation with a positive cosmological constant .",
    "recent astronomical observations of supernovae and cosmic microwave background @xcite indicate that the universe is accelerating and can be well approximated by a world with a positive cosmological constant .",
    "if the universe would accelerate indefinitely , the standard cosmology leads to an asymptotic ds universe .",
    "de sitter spacetime plays an important role in the inflationary scenario , where an exponentially expanding approximately ds spacetime is employed to solve a number of problems in standard cosmology .",
    "the quantum field theory on ds spacetime is also of considerable interest .",
    "in particular , the inhomogeneities generated by fluctuations of a quantum field during inflation provide an attractive mechanism for the structure formation in the universe .",
    "another motivation for investigations of ds based quantum theories is related to the recently proposed holographic duality between quantum gravity on ds spacetime and a quantum field theory living on boundary identified with the timelike infinity of ds spacetime @xcite .",
    "the one of most striking macroscopic manifestations of quantum properties is the casimir effect .",
    "the presence of reflecting boundaries alters the zero - point modes of a quantized field , and results in the shifts in the vacuum expectation values of quantities quadratic in the field , such as the energy density and stresses .",
    "in particular , vacuum forces arise acting on constraining boundaries . the particular features of these forces depend on the nature of the quantum field , the type of spacetime manifold , the boundary geometries and the specific boundary conditions imposed on the field . since the original work by casimir in 1948 @xcite",
    "many theoretical and experimental works have been done on this problem ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
