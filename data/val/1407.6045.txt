    "this paper complements multiplicity statistics in the solar neighborhood . recently ,",
    "multiplicity data on the f- and g - dwarfs within 67pc of the sun ( the fg-67 sample ) and their statistical analysis were published ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter fg67a and fg67b ) .",
    "this work revealed that the census of subsystems in the _ secondary _ components of nearby wide binaries is much less complete than for the main ( primary ) targets . to address this problem ,",
    "a large survey of 212 secondary components on the northern sky has been undertaken with the robo - ao instrument at palomar @xcite .",
    "on the southern sky , however , only a limited one - night survey of wide binaries was made with the nici instrument @xcite and a few secondaries were addressed individually by various authors .",
    "here we imaged 17 faint secondary components at the 4.1-m soar telescope using the laser - assisted adaptive optics ( ao ) system sam ( soar adaptive module ) @xcite to improve spatial resolution with respect to the seeing .",
    "although the achieved resolution of about 05 is inferior to the 01 resolution of the robo - ao , the wide corrected field of sam allows comparison of the target image with other stars and enables binary detection down to a fraction of the full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) resolution ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the secondaries probed with sam are fainter than those surveyed with robo - ao , extending the subsystem census into the low - mass regime .",
    "in addition to the ao - assisted classical imaging , we targeted 46 brighter secondary components with the speckle camera . here",
    ", soar reaches the diffraction - limited resolution of 004 in the @xmath5 band , surpassing robo - ao .",
    "thus , this survey complements the robo - ao effort in different ways , while extending it to the southern sky . joining new observations with data from the literature , we cover here 95 secondary components and give a statistically independent assessment of the frequency of the secondary subsystems .",
    "the fraction of subsystems in the secondary components is a sensitive probe of formation mechanisms of binary stars .",
    "chaotic dynamics of small @xmath4-body systems leads to preferential ejection of low - mass stars .",
    "some ejected stars remain bound to their massive primaries , but they tend to be single and their wide orbits have high eccentricity ( see however fig .  3 in * ? ? ?",
    "the alternative formation mechanism of multiple stars through fragmentation of rotating cores predicts that components on distant orbits inherit a large fraction of the total angular momentum of the core .",
    "therefore their orbits should have moderate eccentricities , they never come very close to the main star , and no dynamical interplay takes place .",
    "in such case , the secondary components are as likely to contain subsystems as the primaries .",
    "this conclusion emerges from the study of the fg-67 sample ; it is strengthened here by the new data .    in section  [",
    "sec : sam ] we present observations of faint secondaries with sam .",
    "the results of the speckle survey are given in section  [ sec : speckle ] .",
    "the complete sample of secondaries is given in section  [ sec : data ] , its statistical analysis is described in section  [ sec : stat ] .",
    "section  [ sec : disc ] discusses the results .",
    "the night of march 4 , 2014 was allocated for the survey with sam through noao ( proposal 2014a-0039 ) .",
    "we selected from the fg-67 sample physical secondary components fainter than @xmath6mag with separations larger than 20   and no prior high - resolution data .",
    "the observing conditions on march 4/5 , 2014 were typical for the cerro pachn site ( figure  [ fig : seeing ] ) .",
    "the seeing fluctuated around its median value of 07 , while the seeing in the free atmosphere ( produced by turbulence above 0.5 km ) was mostly below 05 ( its median at cerro pachn is 040 , * ? ? ?",
    "there were light cirrus clouds at the beginning of the night which however did not prevent laser operation .",
    "the observations had to be stopped at ut 7:30 when the laser projection optics was damaged by a burned insect .",
    "in the following runs we installed a protective mesh in the laser launch telescope to prevent such incidents , without adverse effect on the sam performance .",
    "a total of 21 targets ( 17 of those for this program ) were pointed , with a median overhead time ( from the start of the telescope slew to closing all loops ) of 7min .",
    "the sam operated thus quite efficiently .",
    "it delivered a fwhm resolution limited mostly by the free - atmosphere seeing ( figure  [ fig : seeing ] ) .",
    "the images were acquired by the ccd of 4096@xmath74112 pixels binned 2@xmath72 to the effective pixel scale of 91mas .",
    "it covers a square field of 186 . for each target , three images in the sdss filters @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 @xcite were taken with exposure times ranging from 10s to 1min .",
    "the data were processed in a standard way ( bias subtraction and division by sky flats ) using the pipeline pyraf script of l.  fraga . then three images in each filter were median - combined .",
    "figure  [ fig : sam ] illustrates typical data .",
    "the wide binary hip  50895ab with a separation of 424 was identified by @xcite .",
    "the components share common proper motion and the colors of b match a dwarf of 0.2 solar mass located at the same distance as a , 54pc .",
    "the @xmath11 magnitudes of a and b are 8.12 and 16.3 , respectively , so the image of a is heavily saturated .",
    "the sky is not crowded , but several field stars are still available as point spread function ( psf ) reference . for each secondary component , we selected at least two reference stars .",
    "we developed several tools to detect and characterize potential subsystems ( custom software in idl ) .",
    "first , all targets and reference stars were fitted by the moffat function .",
    "the fwhm resolution was determined from these fits , while residuals show any asymmetry of the psf .",
    "the psfs have a very faint `` tail '' on their lower - right side related to the deformable mirror in sam .",
    "otherwise , the psfs are very symmetric , with ellipticity well under 0.1 .",
    "the peak intensity and total flux were determined for all targets and reference stars in all three filters .    each target",
    "was fitted by a scaled and shifted image of the reference star .",
    "this is the most sensitive test for binary companions .",
    "the fits were repeated with the second reference star , and the two reference stars were mutually cross - checked as well .",
    "we restricted the fits to the 10-pixel radius , looking for close companions ( wider companions are evident anyway ) .",
    "the quality of the fit could be evaluated by the normalized @xmath12 metric if the residuals were dominated by the readout and shot noise .",
    "however , the major contribution to the residuals comes from slight differences between the psfs , so the adequate metric of the fit quality is the rms residual difference normalized by the intensity .",
    "if @xmath13 and @xmath14 are intensities of the target and fitted psf , respectively , in the subset of @xmath15 pixels , the fit quality metric @xmath16 is @xmath17 the median value of @xmath16 in all filters is about 0.05 , and it does not exceed 0.1 . the lower - right insert in figure  [ fig : sam ] shows the residual pattern with @xmath18 : a bright central zone and a dark halo .",
    "the ao correction was slightly better for the target star than for the reference ( 1 ) ( fwhms of 072 and 075 , respectively ) , causing the residual mismatch .",
    "a similar pattern is seen when the target is fitted by the reference ( 2 ) , @xmath19 .",
    "on the other hand , the two reference stars ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are located close to each other and match better , @xmath20 .",
    "among the 17 observed targets , we detected only one new subsystem in hip  53172b .",
    "this is a late - m dwarf with estimated mass of @xmath21 located at 279   from the main component a @xcite .",
    "its distance from the sun is 47pc , @xmath11-magnitudes of a and b are 7.76 and 19.8 , respectively ( a was outside the sam field ) .",
    "the residuals to the psf fits in all filters consistently show a `` butterfly '' pattern expected for an equal - component binary ( figure  [ fig : hip52172 ] ) , while the two reference stars match each other better .",
    "the same asymmetry is seen when approximating the target by a moffat function .",
    "this detection is not absolutely certain , but very likely .",
    "the parameters of the binary pair hip  53172 ba , bb were determined by a procedure similar to the psf fit .",
    "instead of adjusting only relative position and intensity ratio to the psf star , the fitting routine now assumes that the target is a binary and adjusts three additional parameters ( relative position of the binary components and their intensity ratio ) . in the case of hip  53172 ba ,",
    "bb , we found the separation of @xmath222 pixels ( 018 ) at a position angle of @xmath23 , with equal intensity ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "consistent binary parameters are found in all three filters and while using either of the two reference stars .",
    "the fwhm resolution is 05 in both @xmath9 and @xmath10 filters .",
    "so , the binary separation is less than half of the fwhm , its measurement is quite uncertain and can not be used in the future orbit calculation ( the estimated orbital period is a few decades ) .",
    "the quality of the psf fits in the @xmath10 filter using reference stars ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is 0.063 and 0.095 , respectively . by fitting the double - star model",
    ", the residuals improve to 0.033 and 0.027 .",
    "similar improvement of residuals is found in the @xmath9 filter when fitting a double star instead of the psf .    to determine the sensitivity to subsystems , we simulated binaries and fitted them by reference stars . by adopting a conservative detection threshold of @xmath25",
    ", we found that an equal - magnitude binarity is securely detected at a separation equal to half of the fwhm resolution ( figure  [ fig : rms - sep ] ) , while at a separation equal to the fwhm the detectable intensity ratio is about 0.16 , or @xmath26 .",
    "we further adopt @xmath27 at 07 and @xmath28 at 5 , independently of the fwhm .",
    "the deepest detection in terms of the mass ratio is in the band @xmath10 , where the fwhm resolution is better and the low - mass companions are brighter .",
    "these detection limits are adopted in the statistical analysis presented below .",
    "they are obviously approximate and conservative ( the new pair hip  53172 ba , bb is just below the limit ) . to verify the absence of other detectable close companions , we ran the binary - fitting algorithm on all targets .",
    "it returned `` binaries '' with separations of less than 2 pixels .",
    "there was no agreement between binary parameters in different filters , while the residuals from fitting double stars were not substantially reduced in comparison to the psf fits .      for each field",
    ", we determined instrumental magnitudes of stars detected in all three filters by aperture photometry with the aperture radius of 10 pixels and the sky radius of 20 pixels .",
    "the zero point of the instrumental magnitudes corresponds to 25  mag for a flux of 1 count per second .",
    "four targets in the equatorial zone covered by the sdss ( hip  43172 , 43297 , 56738 , 60081 ) were used for photometric calibration .",
    "stars in these fields were matched to the sdss data release 9 @xcite using the topcat tool .",
    "] we calibrate instrumental magnitudes against the psf magnitudes of sdss . after rejecting a few outliers and stars fainter than @xmath29",
    ", we got 22 matches and fitted the instrumental magnitudes by linear relations like @xmath30 the @xmath31 color term is used for all filters .",
    "the extinction was not considered explicitly , being included in the zero - points @xmath32 , because the range of air mass was small ( from 1.04 to 1.27 ) and we did not measure the extinction .",
    "table  [ tab : photsys ] gives the zero points and color terms ( of which the only significant one is in @xmath9 ) and the rms residuals to those linear fits .",
    "the linear equations were inverted to translate instrumental magnitudes into the standard sdss system .",
    "photometry is not the main goal of our program , just a by - product , and its accuracy is about @xmath30.05mag .",

    "all secondary subsystems have periods shorter than @xmath57d and sub - arcsecond separations ( the widest pair hip  113579b = rst  1154 would have @xmath58 at a standard distance of 50pc ) .",
    "some of the surveyed binaries are quite wide and could contain subsystems with separations of a few arcseconds .",
    "such subsystems exist around some primary targets , but none were found around the secondaries , despite the ease of their detection .",
    "however , as noted in fg67a , there is a bias against discovery of wide secondary components that are themselves partially resolved binaries .",
    "subsystems with periods from @xmath1 to @xmath2 days have a good detection probability and are not strongly affected by the dynamical stability .",
    "there are 12 secondary subsystems with such periods , or a raw subsystem frequency of @xmath59 .",
    "we correct for incomplete detection by assuming that the mass ratio @xmath53 in the secondary subsystems is distributed as @xmath60 with @xmath61 or @xmath62 .",
    "these two assumptions correspond to the detection probability of 0.60 and 0.74 and lead to the detection - corrected companion frequency of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively , in the selected range of periods .",
    "the uncertainty related to the choice of @xmath65 is less than the statistical errors .    by looking at figure  [ fig :",
    "pq ] , we note that the mass ratios of secondary subsystems do not show concentration to @xmath66 but are distributed over the whole range . fitting the data by the log - normal period distribution and the power - law @xmath53-distribution using the maximum likelihood method ( see fg67b ) leads to @xmath67 for this sample , while @xmath68 was derived for secondary subsystems in the full fg-67 sample .",
    "so , we retain the estimate of subsystem frequency of @xmath63 as the most plausible .    binaries with solar - type primaries are described by the log - normal period distribution with a median of @xmath69 days , logarithmic dispersion of 2.40 , and companion fraction of 0.56 ( fg67b ) .",
    "the companion fraction in the selected two decades of period is then 0.18 , matching within errors the fraction of secondary subsystems found here .",
    "we tried to evaluate whether the absence of relatively wide secondary subsystems is significant .",
    "the statistical model of independent multiplicity developed in fg67b describes the period distribution of subsystems by a product of the log - normal generating period distribution and the dynamical constraint @xmath70 imposed by the outer binaries .",
    "the full line in figure  [ fig : cum ] depicts this model for the sample of secondaries studied here .",
    "it predicts that about a quarter of secondary subsystems ( 5 out of 23 ) should have separations above 1 arcsec .",
    "the cumulative histogram of the actual secondary periods is plotted in dashed line .",
    "it is not corrected for the observational selection ( e.g. detection probability @xmath71 at @xmath72d , see figure  [ fig : pq ] ) .",
    "addition of short undetected periods would move the dashed line further to the left .",
    "the emerging tentative conclusion is that the periods of secondary subsystems are indeed shorter than predicted by the dynamical stability constraint alone .",
    "this study confirms that the occurrence of subsystems in the secondary components of wide binaries is as likely as the binarity of their main solar - type primaries .    with sam , we probed binarity of 15 very low mass ( vlm ) secondaries .",
    "their median mass is only 0.16@xmath73 , the most massive ( hip  64056b ) has a mass of 0.28@xmath73 and the smallest ( hip  41211c ) is only 0.11@xmath73 .",
    "the new pair hip  53172 ba , bb has components of 0.10@xmath74 .",
    "one detected binary out of 15 means a 0.07 fraction of subsystems , which is less than @xmath75 for the whole sample .",
    "however , the resolution of sam is inferior in comparison to speckle interferometry and full ao , so a lower detection rate is expected .",
    "vlm binaries tend to be closer than 15au , with a peak separation around 5au @xcite .",
    "this translates to angular separations of 03 and 01 , respectively , at 50pc distance .",
    "most vlm binaries within 67pc are too close to be resolved by sam .",
    "if low - mass components of wide binaries are similar to other vlm stars , the detection of just one subsystem here is normal .",
    "the binarity of vlm stars is better studied at diffraction - limited resolution using large telescopes , ao , and infrared detectors . among the 23 secondary subsystems in table  [ tab : sec ] , two ( hip  45170 ea , eb and hip  116106 bc ) are such vlm pairs discovered by adequate techniques .",
    "although another vlm binary was found here with sam , we could not measure accurately its relative position .",
    "on the other hand , bright secondary components of larger mass can be effectively surveyed by speckle interferometry which does reach the diffraction - limited resolution .",
    "seven new pairs ( one of them actually triple ) are added by this work .",
    "many secondaries are bright enough for rv monitoring .",
    "it is obvious from figure  [ fig : pq ] that the census of secondary subsystems is very poor at short periods , so their rv survey is needed .",
    "the fraction of secondary subsystems with @xmath76 from 3 to 5 is found here to be @xmath63 or @xmath64 , depending on the assumption about the mass - ratio distribution .",
    "adopting @xmath77 , @xcite found the detection - corrected frequency of @xmath78 in a smaller period range from 3.5 to 5 ; this translates to @xmath79 when scaled to the 2-dex period interval .",
    "the two independent samples of wide secondary components studied by different instruments gave the same result , enhancing its confidence .",
    "@xcite found that the presence of secondary and primary subsystems is correlated . the southern sample of 95 secondaries studied here contains 36 primary subsystems , 8 of which also have secondary subsystems ( i.e. are 2 + 2 quadruples ) .",
    "if the occurrence and discovery of primary and secondary subsystems are mutually independent , the expected number of coincidences is @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , this smaller sample shows no evidence of the correlation discovered by @xcite and confirmed in fg67b .    by gathering data on hierarchical multiple systems ,",
    "we advance the understanding of their origin . to first order",
    ", hierarchical multiples can be described by picking randomly inner and outer subsystems from the same generating distribution of periods and keeping only stable configurations .",
    "however , the reality deviates from this simplistic model of independent multiplicity in several ways .",
    "here we noted the lack of relatively wide secondary subsystems ( if present , they would have been readily detected ) .",
    "@xcite believe that short periods of vlm binaries can not be explained by their ejection from young clusters .",
    "similarly , the secondary subsystems are closer than allowed by the outer binaries , meaning that the dynamics alone is not a valid explanation for their short periods .",
    "rather , this feature could be related to the correlation between mass and angular momentum in the epoch of mass accretion when the properties of nascent binaries and multiples are established .",
    "the software for reducing sam images was developed by l.  fraga . c.  briceo advised me on photometry .",
    "this work used the simbad service operated by centre des donnes stellaires ( strasbourg , france ) , bibliographic references from the astrophysics data system maintained by sao / nasa , the washington double star catalog maintained at usno , and data from the sloan digital sky survey dr9 .",
    "funding for sdss - iii has been provided by the alfred p. sloan foundation , the participating institutions , the national science foundation , and the u.s .",
