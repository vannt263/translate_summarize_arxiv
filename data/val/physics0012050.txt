    ".    the silicon pixel detector of the atlas experiment will be exposed at intense fluxes of radiation during its lifetime ; as a result the properties and the conditions of operation of the sensors will change .",
    "several single chip assemblies were characterised extensively in test beam experiments performed at the cern sps accelerator with a pion beam of 180 gev/_c _ momentum  @xcite .",
    "a beam telescope consisting of 4 pairs of silicon microstrips detectors ( each pair consisting of two planes of detectors with orthogonal strips ) was used to measure the transverse position of the incident beam particles .",
    "the pixel assemblies and the silicon strip telescope were positioned inside a magnet for the measurement of the lorentz angle .      a detailed description of the atlas pixel sensors can be found in  @xcite , so only a brief description is given here .",

    "typical thresholds were around 3000 electrons .",
    "some detectors were exposed to a fluence comparable to those expected for lhc .",
    "irradiations were performed using the 300 mev/@xmath6 pion beam at psi and the 55 mev/@xmath6 proton beam at lbnl .",
    "sensors irradiated with fluences of 0.5@xmath310 ^ 15^ and 1@xmath310 ^ 15^ @xmath7/cm^2^ , hereafter referred respectively as half - irradiated and full - irradiated sensors , were tested in the beam .",

    "the distribution of charge produced by ionizing particles while drifting to the read - out pixels can spread over more than one pixel .",
    "the spread depends on the particle incidence angle and is minimum for an angle equal to the lorentz angle .",

    "were taken both without magnetic field and with a magnetic field of 1.4 tesla .",
    "data taken without magnetic field were used to check the consistency of the measurement with an expected value of @xmath9 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the mean cluster size as a function of the angle for not - irradiated sensor operated at 150 v is shown in fig .",

    "the same sensor was measured again in 1999 , finding a compatible value of @xmath12 .",
    "an half - irradiated sensor was also tested at two different operating voltages : at 600 v as foreseen during data taking in atlas and at the lower voltage of 150 v for a better understanding of its behaviour .",

    "model prediction is superimposed ( dashed line ) ]    the expected mean multiplicity as a function of the track incidence angle was numerically calculated , using the properties and the operating conditions of the detectors under study ( temperature , magnetic field , bias voltage , depletion , geometry and thresholds ) .",
    "this calculation is based on a model which describes charge drifting in silicon devices .",
    "to compute the drifting trajectories is necessary to know the electric field , the magnetic field and the mobility .    the lorentz angle @xmath2 is given by @xcite    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the hall mobility and @xmath17 the drift mobility .",
    "their ratio r ( hall factor ) depends on the scattering mechanism .",
    "it has a weak dependence on temperature while it does not depend on doping level as long as the doping level is below @xmath18 .",

    "this dependence was parametrized as in @xcite .",
    "[ fig : mobility ] shows the mobility and the lorentz angle ( assuming @xmath19 and @xmath20 t ) as a function of the electric field for @xmath21=263 k and @xmath21=300  k ( irradiated and not - irradiated detectors ) .",
    "the markers correspond to the temperature and the _ mean _ electric field @xmath22 present in the detectors under study , where v is the applied voltage and d is the depletion depth .",
    "( 75,50 ) ( -6,0 )    the irradiated samples have a lower lorentz angle because of lower mobility due to a larger electric field .",
    "actually the electric field is not constant in the detector due to the presence of spatial charges , then lorentz angle varies throughout the detector with the position inside the depletion zone .",
    "the track incidence angle for which the mean hit multiplicity is minimum was defined _ effective lorentz angle_.    the doping concentration was assumed to be uniform .",
    "this is in agreement with the scaling of depletion depth with bias voltage observed in half - irradiated detectors : the depletion approximately doubles when the voltage is increased from 150  v to 600 v. with this assumption the electric field varies linearly from the backplane to the read - out plane , both in irradiated samples , which have a p - type substrate and are partially depleted , and in not - irradiated devices which are over depleted .",
    "the mean multiplicity for a given detector and track incidence angle was computed taking into account charge drifting , charge diffusion and threshold .",
    "experimental results were compared with the model .",
    "the values of depletion depth used in the model were experimentally measured ( see section[sec : dep ] ) .",
    "the results obtained are summarized in table  [ table:2 ] .",
    "the measurement of the depletion depth was performed rotating the detector around the axis parallel to the longer size of pixels .",
    "the angle between the beam direction and the normal to the sensor plane was set to @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",

    "( 75,75 ) ( -6,0 )    the charge collected at each pixel is proportional to the length of the track segment in the depleted area below the pixel itself .",

    "the consistency of the method was checked with not - irradiated sensors , that are fully depleted , for which the depletion is equal to the nominal thickness .",
    "the lorentz angle of atlas pixel radiation - hard sensors in a field of 1.4 tesla was measured . for a not - irradiated sensor operated at 150 v a value of @xmath10",
    "was found .",
    "two different measurements for a sensor irradiated with @xmath26 and operated at 600 v gave the compatible values of @xmath11 . and",
