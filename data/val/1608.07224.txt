    "the handiness of powerful computational instruments and recent improvements in multidisciplinary methods are providing researchers an ever - greater opportunity to investigate societies in their complex nature @xcite .",
    "several research outcomes have been showing that men and women differ in characteristics that could be related to their collaboration patterns .",
    "research collaboration is increasing in frequency and scope .",
    "it is driven , among other causes , by growing relationship across scientific disciplines , improvement of the efficiency in research resources in projects and development of information and communication technologies @xcite .",
    "the motivations @xcite , strategies , patterns and impacts on scientific productivity in quantity and quality in research collaboration have received great scholarly attention ( @xcite;@xcite;ductor15 ) .",
    "the patterns vary across space ( @xcite;@xcite ) , academic ranks @xcite , professional origins @xcite and scientific disciplines @xcite .",
    "economic science makes connections with many other scientific disciplines , like statistics or social sciences , like sociology , history or management ( @xcite;@xcite ) .",
    "economics shows a growing increase of co - authorship ( @xcite;@xcite;@xcite ) . on average ,",
    "a researcher in economics had less than one co - author in the 1970s , 1.24 co - authors in the 1980s and 1.67 in 1990s ( @xcite;@xcite ) .",
    "gender differences in collaborative research concerning motivations , strategies , patterns and impacts on science performance have received little attention , contrasting with the growing importance that women hold in academia and research .",
    "the literature shows mixed results about the gender differences concerning research collaboration strategies @xcite , impacts ( @xcite;@xcite;@xcite-@xcite ) and patterns ( @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "bibliometric studies and survey analysis are the main methodologies to the study of research collaboration @xcite .",
    "large bibliometric databases like web of science ( @xcite;@xcite;@xcite ) are the main sources used to bibliometric analysis . however , that bibliometric databases have a strong weakness concerning the study of the differences by gender ; they do not include information separated by male - female and the way to overcame that weakness is to obtain the information from the first name nal04 or the family name of the author @xcite .",
    "the present paper seeks to build upon the previous analysis about gender aspects in research collaboration which literature was recently surveyed in @xcite . here",
    ", we intend to contribute to at least two points of the literature : the differences of research collaboration and interdisciplinary participation by gender .",
    "focusing in economics , a scientific subject strongly connected to other scientific domains @xcite and constructing five categories of articles in a gender authorship perspective , this study addresses both issues : research collaboration and interdisciplinarity .    applying a network approach and using as unit of analysis articles indexed in the web of science ( wos ) this analysis maps the research collaboration by gender within dozen of scientific subjects , all associated with economics .",
    "the choice of network approaches to study research collaboration in economics @xcite has been extensively embraced .",
    "it often relies on the discovery of patterns of collaborations within researcher communities , aiming to find the influence of individual researchers in the networks using citation analysis .",
    "reference beaver78 , in the first complete theory of scientific collaboration , list and discuss the causes for that collaboration .",
    "they stress that it is necessary , when scientists deal with research questions , that cross disciplinary bounds .",
    "they also identify a large variation in collaboration by discipline , which is being further investigated in more recently published studies ( @xcite;@xcite ) .",
    "its well known that the adoption of a network approach allows the modeling of social structures from a bottom - up perspective , as resulting from the interaction ( or likeness ) of individual characteristics @xcite .",
    "moreover , as the individual characterization might be driven by multiple aggregate concerns , the network approaches allow for simultaneously considering that multiplicity of individual aspects and the consequences of the aggregate structures themselves on the emergence of collective patterns .",
    "meanwhile , in the adoption of a network approach , one shall be aware that the choice of a given network representation is only one out of several other ways to look at a given set of elements .",
    "as connecting the elementary units of a system may be conceived in many different ways , that choice may depend strongly on the available empirical data and on the questions that a network analysis aims to address @xcite .",
    "the main question addressed in this paper is whether some relevant characteristics of research collaboration would emerge in networks where subjects are linked whenever they co - occur in a common paper .",
    "we hypothesized that gender imbalance in authorship of papers might influence the shape of those networks , allowing to uncover patterns from gender differences .",
    "if it happens , the emerging patterns may help to understand important characteristics of research collaboration , of the relationship among subjects and its relation to gender .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : next section presents the empirical data we work with and some preliminary statistical results .",
    "section 3 describes the network approach and the results from its application .",
    "section 4 concludes .",
    "the web of science ( wos ) is one of the major bibliometric databases ( together with google scholar and scopus ) and includes all scientific subjects .",
    "it comprises a total of 11,990 journals ( 8,778 from science and 3,212 from social sciences ) @xcite .",
    "concerning the scientific domain of economics , it includes 334 publications .",
    "the wos classifies each journal in one or more subjects ( or categories ) .",
    "taking as examples the journals * journal of informetrics * and * research policy * , the former is classified in `` computer science , interdisciplinary applications '' and `` information science & library science '' , while the latter is classified in `` management '' and `` planning & development '' .    from the original wos database a selection of articles was carried on adopting as criteria : articles published in wos indexed journals over the period 2010 - 2015 , having economics as scientific subject and at least one author affiliated to a portuguese institution .    our motivation to focus on the field of economics and on the papers whose",
    "authors are affiliated to portuguese institutions is twofold :    1 .",
    "economic science makes connections with many other scientific subjects .",
    "2 .   according oecd data , portugal presents the highest percentage of women in research during the period of 2004 - 2012 ( oecd , 2016 ) .",
    "consequently , our approach is applied to a data set comprising 1,138 papers published in 2010 , 2011 , 2012 , 2013 , 2014 and 2015 and having economics as the main subject matter .    besides economics",
    ", each paper may have extra ( or secondary ) subjects .",
    "table 1 presents the set of secondary ( extra ) subjects found in our data set .",
    "each paper in the data set is coded by a string that informs about the presence of extra subjects . in the broader set of 1,138 papers having economics as the main subject matter , 29 different extra ( or secondary ) subjects were found .    [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     table 4 : topological coefficients computed from the mst of each authorship category .",
    "although the five networks have similar sizes , there is a remarkable difference in the values obtained for the man exclusive tree ( m.exc-mst ) .",
    "when women are excluded , the network of subjects displays an much higher diameter ( @xmath0 ) , showing large distances among subjects are enlarged .",
    "the also important decrease in the number of leafs ( @xmath1 ) indicates that this network develops a entirely different structure when compared with the other msts by authorship category .",
    "the plots in figure 10 show the number of leafs ( @xmath2 , the diameter ( @xmath3 and the ratio @xmath4 across the different categories of authorship . as ,",
    "depending on the specific tree motif , the values of @xmath0 and @xmath5 move in opposite directions , in computing the absolute value of the difference @xmath6 relative to @xmath7 helps to emphasize the distinguish structure of the mst that characterizes the man exclusive network ( m.exc-mst ) .    in the broader set of papers published in wos indexed journals over the period 2010 - 2015 in the scientific domain of economics and having at least one author affiliated to a portuguese institution , as the percentage of female authorship decreases , the mst obtained from the corresponding network of subjects moves from a star configuration to a path motif . in so doing ,",
    "the larger distances between subjects are enlarged and the number of poorly connected subjects increases . if , conversely , the network of subjects has a high percentage of female authorship , the corresponding mst approaches a star motif , the number of leafs is enlarged and the corresponding diameter decreases .",
    "there are many ways to link the elementary units of system in order to induce a network .",
    "choosing the most suitable way depends strongly on the available empirical data and on the research questions that a network analysis aims to address .",
    "regarding available empirical data , most of bibliometric databases have a strong weakness concerning the study of the differences by gender .",
    "in what concerns research questions , gender differences in collaborative research and interdisciplinarity in scientific outputs have received little attention when compared with the growing importance that women hold in academia and research .    from the set of papers published in wos indexed journals over the period 2010 - 2015 in the scientific domain of economics and having at least one author affiliated to a portuguese institution",
    ", our results apparently converge to the hypothesis that women prefer to work in teams .",
    "however , they also indicate that when papers are exclusively authored by women , the working teams tend to be smaller than any of those that also include men .",
    "these results converge to the mixed results reported in the literature , where different units of analysis , measures , methods and samples were adopted ( @xcite;@xcite ; @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "regarding interdisciplinarity , our findings seem to contradict the hypothesis that women have more propensity to interdisciplinary research collaboration @xcite .",
    "moreover , we found that academic women in economics compared with their male counterparts reveal preference for the subjects environmental sciences , management and political sciences and that , conversely , the subjects social sciences , mathematics and finance display higher frequencies in papers either inclusively or exclusively authored by men .",
    "our main contribution relies in the adoption of a network approach allowing to uncover the emergence of a specific pattern when the network of scientific subjects is induced from a set of papers exclusively authored by men .",
    "such a male exclusive authorship condition is found to be the solely responsible for the emergence of that specific shape in the structure of the network .",
    "moving away from a _ star _ motif together with the loss of centrality of the subject management have an important bearing on the structure of the  male exclusive authorship network : when papers authorship includes just men , the larger distances between subjects in the network become even larger and this is mainly due to a decrease in the relative number of papers having management as a secondary subject .",
    "we find enough evidence that gender imbalance in scientific authorships brings a peculiar trait to the networks of subjects .",
    "such a peculiar trait might facilitate future network analyses of research collaboration and interdisciplinarity .",
