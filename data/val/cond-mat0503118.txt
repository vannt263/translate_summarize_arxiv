    "it is well known that conventional long range order can not exist in a two dimensional continuous spin system@xcite .",
    "however the existence of topological charges leads to a quasi long range order ( qlro ) to disorder phase transition .",
    "the most notable and thoroughly investigated example is the two dimensional xy model ( o(2 ) model ) in which , using a renormalization group technique , kosterlitz and thouless @xcite predicted a qlro - disorder phase transition which is associated with the unbinding of the vortex - antivortex pairs ( topological charges of strength @xmath31 ) which are stable topological defects in this system .",
    "the phase with qlro is characterized by an algebraic decay of the spin - spin correlation function which is a slower decay than the fast exponential one which is observed in a completely disordered system . on the other hand in the two dimensional nonlinear sigma model ,",
    "an example of which is the planar o(3 ) model , there exists no stable topological defect and the system remains disordered at all finite temperature @xcite .",
    ".the parameters obtained in the l=80 , p@xmath4 model for the best fit g(r)@xmath5 of the correlation function at the temperatures indicated . in the normal lattice at these temperatures",
    "g(r ) decays exponentially to zero . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     another class of the two dimensional systems of interest is the planar lebwohl lasher ( ll ) @xcite model and a modified version of it to be elaborated below . in the 3-dimensional version of the ll model , the spins ( of dimensionality 3 ) , located at the sites of a simple cubic lattice ,",
    "interact with nearest neighbors via a potential @xmath2@xmath6 where @xmath7 is the angle between the spins and p@xmath0 is the second legendre polynomial .",
    "this model successfully describes the orientational aspects of a nematic and undergoes a weakly first order phase transition , representative of the nematic@xmath2isotropic transition , seen in a real nematic . a number of investigators @xcite",
    "have used a modified version of the ll model by adding a @xmath2p@xmath1 term to the usual @xmath2p@xmath0 one , p@xmath1 being the fourth order legendre polynomial .",
    "the introduction of the p@xmath1 term reduces the sharpness of the peak of the p@xmath0 term in the potential at @xmath8 and may lead to the appearance of a local minimum , depending on the relative strengths of the p@xmath0 and p@xmath1 terms in the potential .",
    "this is found to enhance the first orderdness of the n - i transition .",
    "the two dimensional version of the ll model and a modified version of it with a pure p@xmath1 interaction between nearest neighbor spins have recently been investigated using monte carlo(mc ) methods by a number of authors @xcite . in the rest of this paper",
    "we shall refer to these as the planar p@xmath0 and p@xmath1 models respectively .",
    "both models possess in addition to the usual o(3 ) symmetry , a z@xmath0 symmetry as well and this leads to the identification of the antipodal points in the order parameter space s@xmath9 .",
    "the planar p@xmath0 model is known to exhibit a continuous phase transition at a dimensionless temperature whose thermodynamic limit is 0.547 @xcite and the p@xmath1 model is characterized by a strongly first order transition at temperature 0.376 @xcite . in the low temperature ordered phase in both models",
    "the pair correlation function shows an algebraic decay to a plateau which changes over to an exponential decay in the neighborhood of the phase transition@xcite .",
    "the role of defects in the phase transition of various three dimensional spin systems is very difficult to study theoretically due to the nonlinearity introduced in the three dimensional nature of the spins .",
    "however simulation technique may be used to investigate the role of topological defects in these systems .",
    "lau and dasgupta@xcite have shown numerically using the conventional metropolis algorithm that monopoles ( hedgehogs ) are necessary for the phase transition in the three dimensional heisenberg model .",
    "these authors observed that if one suppresses the formation of these defects in the 3-d heisenberg model , the system remains ordered at all temperatures and the transition to the disordered phase disappears altogether . the present work , which involves an elaborate mc study , was undertaken to investigate the effect of the suppression of the topological defects on the phase transitions which the planar p@xmath0 and p@xmath1 models exhibit .",
    "the work was motivated to a large extent by the work of lau and dasgupta@xcite in the 3-d heisenberg model .",
    "another work , along the same line , which must be mentioned in this context , is that of lammert et .",
    "al.@xcite who , in a mc study , have shown that the nature of the nematic - isotropic transition in a 3d nematic changes when one suppresses the formation of the stable line defects , called the disclination lines .",
    "our work shows that the topological defects play a very crucial role in the phase transition in the planar p@xmath0 and p@xmath1 models and although these models possess the same symmetry they have remarkably different critical behavior .    in the next section",
    "we briefly discuss the nature of the topological defects in the planar p@xmath0 and p@xmath1 models and the algorithms for their identification are presented in the following one .",
    "the details of our mc simulation is then presented followed by the result and discussion .",
    "in the two dimensional heisenberg model there exists no stable topological defects .",
    "so the first or the fundamental homotopy group is just the set containing identity .",
    "however in the present planar models ( p@xmath0 and p@xmath1 ) due to the local z@xmath0 symmetry in addition to the o(3 ) symmetry there arises stable topological point defects known as 1/2-disclination points , where the director rotates through an angle of 180@xmath10 around the defect core .",
    "the order parameter space is just the unit sphere s@xmath9 with antipodal points identified .",
    "any mapping of the other half integral point defects on the order parameter space is homotopically equivalent to the mapping of the 1/2-defect .",
    "point defects of integral strength are not stable in these models because of the so called escape to the third dimension. any attempt to escape from a configuration containing a 1/2 point defect leads to a more singular semi infinite line defect extending from the defect core .",
    "so the fundamental or the first homotopy group of the concerned models is just the two element group z@xmath0@xcite ,    @xmath11    it is known that topological instability does not necessarily imply physical instability@xcite .",
    "if the path connecting the singular to nonsingular configurations of the free energy involves a configuration of higher free energy than either , then one may say that the topologically unstable singularity may possess a considerable degree of physical metastability .",
    "this seems to happen in the p@xmath1-model and may be briefly explained as follows .",
    "consider a configuration where each of the four spins at the lattice sites which form a unit square are in a plane and oriented at right angle to their neighbors .",
    "the @xmath12 potential , besides having the global minimum at @xmath7 = 0 ( or @xmath7=@xmath13 ) , also has a local minimum at @xmath8 . if the orientation of the spins are now gradually changed in order to make @xmath14 (",
    "so as to reach the ground state ) a potential barrier will have to be overcome and the process becomes energetically costly .",
    "thus there may exists metastable integral point defects in this model@xcite .",
    "the algorithm for the detection of these defects is however nontrivial as it is not really possible to enclose a 1-defect by four spins alone .",
    "the possible method of detection of these defects is discussed in the next section .",
    "we add that we were unable to detect any such defect because of the low probability of their formation .",
    "in order to detect the 1/2-point defects we have followed the algorithm originally proposed by vachaspati@xcite and subsequently used by others@xcite . in order to trace out the topological defects it will be useful to see when a closed loop in the physical space will enclose a 1/2 disclination point .",
    "let us consider a triangular plaquette abc in the physical space .",
    "due to local inversion symmetry we have to assign antipodal pair points on the unit sphere ( s@xmath9 ) for each site of the triangular plaquette .",
    "let points corresponding to a , b and c be ( n , s ) , ( p , p@xmath15 ) and ( r , r@xmath15 ) [ fig1 ] . let us start from the north pole n. the point p or p@xmath15 is selected depending on which is closer to n. let p be the selected point .",
    "so the arc np of the great circle on the order parameter space is traversed when we go from site a to b on the physical space . select from r or r@xmath15 whichever is closer to p. if the selected point is closer to s then the mapping of abc is a non contractible loop and the plaquette will enclose a 1/2-disclination point defect .",
    "however if the selected point for c is closer to n , then the mapping is contractible to a point on the sphere and no defect will be enclosed by the triangular plaquette .",
    "it may be noted that if s@xmath16 , s@xmath17 and s@xmath18 are the spin variables associated with the points a , b and c then the triangular plaquette will enclose a 1/2-defect if @xmath19=-1\\ ] ]    priezev and pelcovits @xcite in their work on 3-dimensional nematics have defined defect counting operators base on this principle . beside these two mathematically equivalent methods ,",
    "an algorithm for detecting 1/2-defects in rp@xmath9 models can be developed on the method first proposed by berg and luscher@xcite .",
    "the method works as follows .",
    "the projection matrix p associated with each unit spin vector @xmath20 in rp@xmath9 model obeys relation p@xmath9 = p and tr p=1 and its elements may be defined as p@xmath21=@xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 = 1,2,3 .",
    "the charge at a lattice site x@xmath25 enclosed by an elementary triangular plaquette which has the projection matrices p@xmath26 , p@xmath0 and p@xmath27 associated with its corners is given by    @xmath28    we have used and checked that all the three above mentioned algorithms for the detection of the 1/2-defects in triangular plaquettes are exactly equivalent in all cases in both models .",
    "the detection of the metastable 1-defects in the p@xmath1 model is a non - trivial job and the probability of their formation is very low as this requires a very special arrangement of the order parameter over many uncorrelated domains @xcite . in 3-d nematics , in principle where both line and point defects ( hedgehogs ) may form , no point defects are observed in experiments on quenched nematics @xcite until the defect network has coarsened appreciably .",
    "it has been observed that the monopoles were only formed by string interactions and none were generated during the quench .",
    "using the topology , more specifically , the homology of the order parameter space@xcite , hindmarsh has explained why the expected density of point defects in extremely low .",
    "the observation , briefly speaking , is that in order to cover rp@xmath9 space twice ( which is necessary for a topological 1-charge ) a roughly spherical arrangement of a minimum of twelve uncorrelated adjacent domains is necessary and this has a probability ~10@xmath29 . in a two dimensional nematic the same consideration",
    "are believed to apply for the the + 1 point defects@xcite .",
    "we have used the algorithm using 12-spin configuration proposed by zapotacky et .",
    "al . @xcite to detect the 1-charge but could find none .",
    "in the present paper we have used the conventional metropolis spin update algorithm@xcite with periodic boundary condition in order to study the role of the topological defects in the phase transitions exhibited by the planar p@xmath0 and p@xmath1 model .",
    "lattice sizes ranging from 20x20 to 80x80 were used and a part of the work was performed using the histogram reweighting technique of ferrenberg and swendsen @xcite .    in order to carry out the procedure of the suppression of the defects in the planar lattice models we have included a chemical potential term associated with the topological charges @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian used in the simulation is given by,@xmath30 where l is either 2 or 4 .",
    "@xmath31 is the angle between the nearest neighbor spins i , j and the @xmath32 is the sum of charges of two triangular portions of a square plaquette .",
    "a positive @xmath33 makes the formation of the charges expensive in terms of energy and for almost total suppression of the charge a large value of @xmath33 ( about 10 to 60 , but independent of temperature ) was normally chosen . in order to obtain the unrestricted simulation we set @xmath34",
    "the charge enclosed by ijk for instance is given by .",
    "@xmath35\\ ] ]    in both the planar models we have investigated , the smallest part of the system in real space that can enclose a 1/2-point defect is a triangle .",
    "each elementary square plaquette can be diagonally cut into two triangles and if these two adjacent triangles each enclose a 1/2-defect then this leads to a 1/2-pair charge being enclosed by the elementary square .",
    "if only one of those triangles encloses a 1/2-charge then the square in turn encloses a single 1/2-charge .",
    "we denote number of square plaquettes enclosing a pair of 1/2-charges by n@xmath26 ( this should however not be confused with a topological defect of charge 1 ) . similarly the number of elementary squares enclosing a single 1/2-charge is denoted by n@xmath36 . in a recent work , mondal and roy@xcite",
    "have observed that the ratio n@xmath36/n@xmath26 behaves like a response function in both the models although their behavior is different in the two systems . when plotted against temperature , the ratio n@xmath36/n@xmath26 exhibits a maximum at the transition in the p@xmath0 model while in the p@xmath1 model it shows a sharp fall at the transition .",
    "finite size effects are also prominent in the transition temperatures thus obtained from the n@xmath36/n@xmath26 vs t plots .    in our mc simulation ,",
    "while investigating the effect of suppression for the charges in the two planar models , we have treated the single 1/2-charge and the 1/2-pairs ( within an elementary square plaquette ) on different footings . for the simulation where",
    "no charge suppression has been attempted we have set @xmath34 . for the suppression of the charges represented by n@xmath36 ,",
    "@xmath37 only for q@xmath38 = 1/2 while for total ( both single-1/2 and 1/2-pair suppression ) , @xmath37 for q@xmath39 . in the p@xmath0 model , complete suppression of single 1/2-defects was found to lead to complete suppression of the 1/2-pair defects and this leads to complete elimination of the phase transition in this model . in the p@xmath1 model",
    ", however , the suppression of the single 1/2-defects leaves a large number of 1/2-pair defects within the elementary squares and the evidence of a new phase transition at a higher temperature is obtained .",
    "when these defects too were suppressed , the phase transition totally disappears .    in order to estimate the critical exponents and the thermodynamic limit of the critical temperature of the new transition which we obtained in the p@xmath1 model and which seems to be of second order , we have applied the finite size scaling method .",
    "finite size scaling method is a technique of estimating the critical exponents and the thermodynamic limit of the transition temperature by observing how the measured quantities vary with the system size . in finite size scaling method ( the data collapse method in particular )",
    "we extract the part of the thermodynamic function which does not contain system size explicitly@xcite .",
    "this part is called the scaling function . if proper values of the critical exponents and the thermodynamic limit for the transition temperature are chosen then the scaling function for different system sizes get collapsed . in this paper",
    "we have used the data collapse technique for estimating the critical exponents associated with the specific heat and the order parameter .",
    "the critical exponents associated with the correlation length , specific heat and the order parameter are denoted by @xmath40 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .    for specific heat",
    ", the scaling relation stands as    @xmath41    where t is the reduced temperature and @xmath42 is the specific heat scaling function .    similarly for the order parameter ( < q@xmath9>)(see eq .",
    "[ ord ] ) , the scaling relation is given by    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is known as the order parameter scaling function@xcite .",
    "we have evaluated various thermodynamic properties like internal energy per particle ( < e > ) , specific heat , order parameter etc .",
    "the specific heat was evaluated by taking the temperature derivative of the < e > as well as from fluctuation of the energy . due to the local inversion symmetry , the order parameter is a second rank tensor .    as a measure of the order prevailing in the system we used the quantity",
    "< q@xmath9 > given in ref.@xcite    @xmath45    @xmath46 molecule ) and n is the total number of sites ( i ) in the lattice .",
    "this definition ensures that < q@xmath9 > is zero in a fully disordered system and 1 for a fully ordered system .    in case of p@xmath0 model",
    "we have simulated for linear dimension l=40 and 60 .",
    "in fig2 we have depicted the specific heat versus temperature plot for the p@xmath0 lattice model of size 40x40 .",
    "the unrestricted simulation shows a peak which disappears when the single 1/2-charges on the square plaquettes were suppressed .",
    "we have observed that the after suppression of the single 1/2-charges on the square plaquettes there remains no 1/2-pair defect in any square plaquette .",
    "the temperature dependence of the order parameter used in this model for the two cases are shown in fig3 .",
    "while the temperature derivative of < q@xmath9 > has a peak at the transition temperature in the normal case ( where no defect is suppressed ) , which presumably is a signal of a phase transition in a finite system @xcite , in the defect free case it seems to lose the characteristic shape and shows a smooth and rather slow decrease with temperature and vanishes at around a temperature t=6 .",
    "we would be inclined to conclude from the results on c@xmath47 and < q@xmath9 > that the defect free phase exhibits no phase transition at all .    turning to the p@xmath1 model ,",
    "which has a characteristic strongly first order phase transition@xcite , we first point out that the suppression of the single 1/2 defects on the square plaquettes here does not result in suppression of the 1/2-pair defects on the square plaquettes .",
    "this observations is different from what happens in the p@xmath0 system where the suppression of the single 1/2 defects on the square plaquettes leads to suppression of the 1/2-pair defects . on suppressing the single 1/2-defects a new phase transition is observed .",
    "we however point out that it is impossible to make the system completely free of topological defects , even when arbitrarily large values of @xmath33 are used .",
    "however the residual charges left were of very insignificant amount .",
    "for instance , at t=0.55 , the traces of the single 1/2 and 1/2-pair charges which could not be suppressed were about 0.02% of these charges present in the system at the same temperature after single 1/2-charge suppression .",
    "fig4 shows the temperature dependence of the specific heat for the normal lattice ( l=40 ) and after suppression of the single 1/2-defects ( for l=40 and 60 ) .",
    "the peak in c@xmath47 for the latter case , while greatly reduced in size ( from 80 to about 17 ) , shifts to a higher temperature which for both lattices is close to 0.494 .",
    "presumably the phase transition which we observed after suppressing the single 1/2 defects is due to the presence of the 1/2-pair defects .",
    "when we suppressed the 1/2-pair defects too in all triangular plaquettes of the lattice no evidence of any peak in c@xmath47 was observed , although a hump like feature was seen with c@xmath47 ~ 3.5 over a temperature range extending from 0.53 to 0.62 . in case of p@xmath1 model",
    "we have also investigated the response of the defect density to the phase transition . when no kind of charge suppression was applied a large number of single 1/2 defects as well as 1/2-pair defects",
    "were found to be present . in fig5 the temperature dependence of the density of single 1/2-defects",
    "are shown for unrestricted simulation . in fig6",
    "the temperature dependence of the density 1/2-pair defects is shown for both before and after suppression of the single 1/2 defects .",
    "clearly the temperature derivative of defect density behaves like other response functions for all the cases .    in figure 7 , we have depicted the temperature dependence of the order parameter",
    "< q@xmath9 > for all three cases in the p@xmath1 model for l=40 .",
    "the peaks of temperature derivative of < q@xmath9 > occur respectively at 0.379 ( normal mc ) and 0.490 ( after suppressing single 1/2-defects ) and their heights are 119.5 and 18.5 respectively . on suppressing all the 1/2 charges on all triangular plaquettes of the lattice ( total charge suppression ) ,",
    "d < q@xmath9>/dt no longer exhibits a peak and < q@xmath9 > seems to have an asymptotic value of 0.1 at t=2 , up to which the investigation has been made .",
    "we add that d <",
    "q@xmath9>/dt after total charge suppression has a feature similar to that seen in c@xmath47 in that a broad peak of height ~4 was seen over a temperature range from 0.52 to 0.6 .",
    "the existence of this broad hump of insignificant magnitude over an extended temperature range can not be a sign of phase transition .",
    "these , in someway , may be connected to the existence of the small number of residual charges left in the system after the attempt to suppress them completely failed .",
    "we now turn to the pair correlation function g(r)@xmath48@xmath2@xmath49 where r is the separation between the two spins i and j which make an angle @xmath7@xmath50 with each other .",
    "this function for the p@xmath0 model at t=0.6 , for instance , which is a temperature much higher than the normal critical temperature in this model , decays exponentially to zero , as it should , in the complete absence of long range order and a best fit with g(r)@xmath51 yields @xmath23=0.439 and @xmath33=0.248 . for the single 1/2-charge ( and consequently of 1/2-pair charges )",
    "suppressed case , it decays algebraically and a best fit like g(r)@xmath52 yields the parameters a=0.404 , b=0.022 and p=0.372 [ fig 8 ] . in figure 9 , the g(r ) vs r plots for the p@xmath1 model are shown for t=0.48 ( which is greater than the normal transition temperature but less than the transition temperature obtained after 1/2-charge suppression ) , t=0.5 ( which is slightly higher than the observed transition temperature after 1/2-charge suppression ) and t=0.68 .",
    "at all of these temperatures , as one would expect , the correlation function in the normal case decays exponentially to zero .",
    "the two other cases give best fits for an algebraic decay to a plateau , and the parameters are listed in the table1 .",
    "we find that in the p@xmath1 model the results of single 1/2-charge suppression is the same as that in the p@xmath0 model while with the suppression of the 1/2-pair charges too , the asymptotic value of the order prevailing in the system increases further . the phase transition , which the p@xmath1 system has after suppressing the single 1/2-charges is second order",
    ". we have evidence that it is not first order as the dual peak structure of the probability distribution as a function of energy , which is so distinct in the p@xmath1 model@xcite , has been found to disappear totally after suppressing the single 1/2-charges on the square plaquettes . in fig10",
    "we have given the the free energy of 40x40 and 60x60 lattice in p@xmath1 model after suppressing the single 1/2 defects on the square plaquettes .",
    "the single well structure of the free energy indicates the second orderdness of the new phase transition after suppressing the single 1/2-defects .",
    "we have also used standard finite size scaling method available for second order phase transition@xcite in order to estimate the critical exponents and the thermodynamic limit of transition temperature of the new phase transition that was observed after suppressing the single 1/2-defects . in fig11 and fig12",
    "we have depicted the order parameter < q@xmath9 > and the specific heat c@xmath47 plots respectively as function of temperature for different lattice sizes after the single 1/2-charge suppression in the p@xmath1 model .",
    "we have used standard data collapse technique to collapse the data of the figures11 and 12 and the resulting diagrams are fig13 and fig14 respectively . in fig13",
    "we have shown the collapse of the order parameter scaling function for l=20 , 40 , 60 and 80 . while in fig14 the collapse of specific heat scaling function for the system sizes 40,60 and 80 are displayed .",
    "the data collapse clearly shows the phase transition that p@xmath1 model exhibits after the single 1/2-charge suppression is second order .",
    "the parameters we have obtained are t@xmath53=0.498 , @xmath540.16 and @xmath40=0.99 for the collapse of order parameter and @xmath55 = 0.4938 , @xmath560.077 and @xmath570.94 from collapse of the specific heat .",
    "we would remark that the high temperature behavior of the order parameter <",
    "q@xmath9 > after total charge suppression does not indicate the presence of a phase transition .",
    "this is true for both models .",
    "we have used large values of @xmath33 in our simulation in order to suppress the evolution of defects in both models .",
    "it is known that any monte carlo study is faithful only if we can reach any point in the phase space starting from any other point .",
    "so there must be a path connecting the two points in phase space with non zero probability .",
    "this actually indicates that we should be careful that we are not trapped in any small region of the phase space .",
    "we have investigated the phase space connectivity in both the models by observing the evolution of order parameter or energy with mc steps .",
    "the connectedness is satisfied if the observed quantities for different initial states converge to the same final value . in fig15",
    "we have shown that in case of the 80x80 p@xmath0 model , after suppressing the 1/2-defects ( by using @xmath33=60 ) on the square plaquettes , the final values of the order parameter is same for three different initial configurations . similarly in fig16 we have shown that the same thing happens for the total energy of the 80x80 p@xmath1 model after suppressing the 1/2-defects on the square plaquettes .",
    "it is therefore clear that we can use a value of @xmath33 at least up to 60 without violating the phase space connectivity .",
    "it is established in this paper that topological defects play a very important role in the phase transitions exhibited by the two planar lattice models we discussed .",
    "the observed difference in the critical behavior seems to be due to the difference in the role played by the topological defects .",
    "it is shown in this paper that for the phase transition in both the models topological defects are necessary . in the p@xmath0 model",
    "the phase transition is governed by the 1/2-disclination points enclosed by the square plaquettes only ( single 1/2 ) .",
    "on suppressing these single 1/2-defects we have shown that the phase transition was totally eliminated .",
    "however the picture is different in case of two dimensional p@xmath1 model . where on suppressing the single 1/2-defects the nature and the transition temperature of the phase transition gets changed .",
    "we have also shown that the new phase transition in the p@xmath1-model is due to the presence of large number of 1/2-pairs ( enclosed by two triangular portions ) within the square plaquettes which remains unsuppressed even after suppressing the single 1/2-defects .",
    "this leads to another important conclusion that for tracing out all the disclination points in two dimension , the minimum closed loops in physical space to be considered are the smallest triangular cells formed by three nearest neighbor sites .",
    "it will be interesting to apply the idea of triangular plaquettes in three dimensional nematics , where the stable topological defects are disclination lines as well as monopoles .",
    "let us consider small disclination loop in a three dimensional nematic [ fig17 ] . in the figure",
    "a cubic unit cell abcdefgh is shown .",
    "the disclination loop has crossed the face abcd twice . however",
    "if we take mapping of abcd on the order parameter space then we would get a contractable loop in the order parameter space and conclude that abcd does not enclosed any line defect .",
    "it is true that abcd does not enclose a single line , but it encloses two close lines ( as the loop intersects the face abcd twice ) , which could be detected only if we consider the two triangular portions ( abc and adc ) of abcd .",
    "so considering the elementary plaquettes to be square plaquettes of linear dimension equal to lattice spacing , we would miss loops as shown in the figure .",
    "in real nematics small loops are known to carry monopole ( hedgehog ) charges .",
    "actual monopole structure is very rare in real nematics .",
    "as already stated , the low probability of actual monopole structure is discussed by hindmarsh @xcite .",
    "the monopoles that comes in to play in the three dimensional nematics arises mainly from the small disclination rings . in our work",
    "it is evident that in p@xmath1 model it is very important to consider these triangular plaquettes in order to trace out the topological defects properly .",
