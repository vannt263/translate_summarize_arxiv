    "the study of statistical models related to loop models is interesting both from the physical and the mathematical point of views .",
    "most of the statistical models studied in physics such as the ising , the q - state potts model and also complicated vertex models can be represented in terms of loops @xcite .",
    "the loop representation of the spin system is very easy to understand : loops correspond to domain walls separating regions of different magnetization .",
    "the study of critical loop models can be interesting from many point of views : they are good candidates for the ground state of topological quantum systems @xcite , they are also good candidates for the schramm loewner evolution ( sle ) , a method discovered by schramm @xcite to classify conformally invariant curves connecting two distinct boundary points in a simply connected domain",
    ".    different applications of conformal loop models are stimulating to do a systematic study of these models by cft .",
    "recently we proposed in  @xcite a method to extract loop models corresponding to a conformal field theory ( cft ) , the method was based on defining a rsos model for every primary operator by using fusion matrix of the primary operator as an adjacency matrix and then extracting the loop model corresponding to domain walls of the rsos model .",
    "the weight of the loop model is equal to the quantum dimension of the corresponding operator . in this paper",
    "we want to follow the same method consistent with the conformal boundary operators , since the sle is a boundary cft we think that using the fusion matrix of boundary operators as an adjacency matrix is more consistent with the nature of sle . recently a very nice and strong project was initiated by jacobsen and saleur @xcite followed by dubail , jacobsen , saleur @xcite to classify all the possible conformal boundary loop models .",
    "it is based on classifying the possible boundary loop models compatible with the boundary conformal field theories .",
    "this classification is in close relation with the earlier work by cardy on formulating the modular invariant partition function of @xmath0 model on the annulus @xcite .",
    "the results that we get by our method apart from simplicity are all compatible with the results in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we will introduce the necessary ingredients to find the boundary operators and also the fusion matrices corresponding to them . in the third section",
    "we briefly review the method proposed in  @xcite and we will also generalize it to the graphs with largest eigenvalue bigger than two .",
    "the central claim of this section is as follows : the loop model extracted with this method is connected with the properties of the statistical loop model in the same universality class as the corresponding cft . in the third section",
    "we follow explicitly some examples in particular ; ising model , tri - critical ising model , three states potts model and tri - critical three states potts model",
    ". then we will give the possible loop models , extractable with this method , of minimal cfts and also the lattice models corresponding to these loop models .",
    "we will close this section by giving some proposals for possible loop models for wzw @xmath1 models .",
    "last section contains our conclusions with a brief description of the work in progress motivated by these results .",
    "to define loop model for a generic minimal cft consistent with the conformal boundary we need to first summarize the main important facts about boundary cft .",
    "the most important ingredient to classify the boundary conformal operators is the modular invariant partition function of the cft .",
    "the classification of modular invariant partition functions of @xmath1 minimal models are well known and can be related to a pair of simply laced dynkin diagrams @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the complete classification based on ade diagrams is @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the coxeter numbers of @xmath6 and @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "the above pair of dynkin diagrams describes bulk modular invariant partition function with some primary operators and with the following central charge @xmath9 each of the unitary minimal models @xmath10 with @xmath11 can be realized as the continuum scaling limit of an integrable two - dimensional lattice model at criticality , with heights living on the nodes of the graph @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , the critical series with @xmath12 is associated with the a - d - e lattice models  @xcite and the tri - critical series with @xmath13 is associated with the dilute lattice models  @xcite . for theories with a diagonal torus partition function it is known that there is a conformal boundary condition associated to each operator in the theory  @xcite",
    ". the fusion rules of these boundary operators are just given by the bulk fusion algebra .",
    "it was shown in a series of papers that for @xmath1 minimal models one can propose a complete set of conformal boundary operators @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are nodes on the dynkin diagram of @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively with the identification @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is an automorphism acting on the nodes of the graph @xmath7 .",
    "this automorphism is identity except for the @xmath6 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 which is @xmath21 symmetry of dynkin diagram , symmetries of dynkin diagrams play an important rule in the forthcoming discussion . following @xcite",
    "we show the corresponding operators by @xmath22 and the independent boundary states by @xmath23 which is called cardy states .",
    "cardy states can be written in terms of ishibashi states , i.e. @xmath24 , as follows @xmath25 , where sum is over all ishibashi states .",
    "we are interested to the fusion rules of these boundary operators . to give a formula for the fusion rules of these operators we need to define some quantities .",
    "let @xmath26 be the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix corresponding to the group @xmath7 then the graph fusion matrices @xmath27 with @xmath28 can be defined as follows @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the set of exponents of @xmath7 , see table  1 .",
    "let s show also the graph fusion matrix for @xmath31 by @xmath32 then following @xcite the fusion rules for boundary operators are @xmath33 where @xmath34 has the following relation with the graph fusion matrices of @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xmath35 for more details about the connection of the boundary operators to bulk counterparts see  @xcite .",
    ".[tab1 ] the coexter number and the coexter exponents of dynkin diagrams . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to calculate the fusion matrices of boundary operators we need also to define a conjugation operator @xmath36 , it is the identity except for @xmath37 graphs where the eigenvectors @xmath38 are complex and conjugation corresponds to the @xmath39 dynkin diagram automorphism .",
    "it then follows that @xmath40 .",
    "the operator @xmath41 acts on the right to raise and lower indices in the fusion matrices @xmath42 so it is the important ingredient to get the right fusion matrices for the boundary operators , in particular for the @xmath37 graphs .",
    "we will give some examples in section  4 , in particular we use the above method to get the fusion matrices of the boundary operators of ising model , tri - critical ising model ,  3 state potts model and tri - critical  3 state potts model .",
    "in this section we propose a method to extract some possible loop models for cfts , the method is the same as the method introduced recently in  @xcite . in that reference",
    "we showed that using the fusion matrix as an adjacency matrix it is possible to associate a @xmath0 loop model to every primary operator .",
    "the method is briefly as follows : the graph of a primary operator @xmath22 has @xmath4 vertices where @xmath4 is the number of primary operators in the theory and edges connecting pairs of vertices @xmath43 when @xmath44 .",
    "following @xcite one can define a height model on the triangular lattice by imposing that the height @xmath45 at the site @xmath46 can take values @xmath47 .",
    "then constraint the heights at neighboring sites according to the incidence matrix associated to a given primary field @xmath22 : only neighbor heights @xmath45 and @xmath48 with @xmath49 are admissible . for",
    "a consistent definition of loop models on a triangular lattice at least two of the heights at the corners of an elementary triangular plaquette should be equal then the weights for the elementary plaquette are defined as follows .",
    "if the heights of plaquette are @xmath50 with @xmath51 then the weight is @xmath52 , where @xmath53 satisfies @xmath54 .",
    "it means that the @xmath55 th element of the eigenvector of @xmath56 with eigenvalue @xmath57 is given by @xmath58 .",
    "if the heights are all equal then the weight is @xmath59 except for those with @xmath60 that have weights @xmath59 or @xmath61 depending on the particular model considered . the next step is to mark triangles with unequal heights @xmath50 drawing a curved segment on the dual honeycomb lattice @xcite and linking to the center the midpoints of the two edges with different heights ( @xmath55 and @xmath62 ) at the extremes ( see fig  1 ) . summing over the admissible values of heights consistent with a given loop configuration",
    "we find @xmath63 where the sum is just over @xmath55 .",
    "we take most of the times @xmath64 to get the largest eigenvalue of @xmath56 to guaranty positive real weights in our height models , however , we will also point to other cases .     and",
    "the corresponding curve segment on the dual honeycomb lattice . ]    the weight of the loops is given by the largest eigenvalue of the fusion matrix @xmath65 and the partition function of the model is as follows @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the number of bonds in the loop configuration and @xmath68 is the number of loops . using this method",
    "we can correspond to every boundary conformal operator a @xmath0 loop model , since the @xmath0 model posses a dilute critical point for @xmath69 with @xmath70 ; see  @xcite , correspondingly our loop models will have a critical point just for the fields with @xmath65 smaller than @xmath71 .",
    "the @xmath0 model has another critical regime , the so - called dense phase , for @xmath72 corresponds to a different universality class .",
    "mapping to the @xmath0 model helps us to find the connection with sle : from coulomb gas arguments we know that , in the dilute regime , the loop weight has the following relation with the drift in the sle equation @xmath73 for the dense phase the above equation is still true if we work in the region @xmath74 . using the above equation we can find the properties of the loop model corresponding to a boundary conformal operator .",
    "the achievement of this method is respecting the cardy s equation @xcite : _ fields in the same sector have the same loop representation_.    before generalizing the definition to more general graphs we should stress that although we started with well defined minimal cft but the loop model that we extracted is not necessarily minimal .",
    "the point is that the extracted loop model respects some aspects of the corresponding conformal field theory .",
    "this is like to say that although the domain walls in ising model at the critical point is the same as the critical @xmath75 but the ising conformal field theory does not explain all the aspects of the critical curves . from this point the loop model that one can get by this method from the rational cft is not perfectly equal to the corresponding cft .",
    "one can generalize the above idea to the decomposable fusion graphs by the method that was explained in @xcite . since the fusion graphs of some operators in minimal models are equivalent to the tensor product of two adjacency diagrams one can use this method to extract new loop models that can also have configurations with crossing loop segments .",
    "the general strategy is based on extracting critical loop models with @xmath69 for the graphs with largest eigenvalue bigger than  2 .",
    "some graphs obey simple decomposition , can be written as tensor product , but others need to be mapped to simple decomposable graphs by going to the ground state adjacency graph @xcite . here",
    "we just comment on decomposable graphs @xmath76 , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are simple ade diagrams . in these cases",
    "we can define two - flavor loop model living on the honeycomb lattice independently , one is related to the loop model of @xmath77 with weight @xmath79 and the other comes from the graph @xmath78 with weight @xmath80 .",
    "fendley showed @xcite that in this case it is also possible to define consistently interacting loop model on the square lattice with partition function @xmath81 , where @xmath82 are the numbers of each kind of loop and @xmath83 is the number of plaquettes with a resolved potential crossing at their center .",
    "the critical values of @xmath55 were calculated in @xcite but the critical properties of the loops are still unsolved .",
    "this is obviously is not the only method to define loop model for non - simple graphs , the other method is based on the multi - flavor loop model of @xcite . in this loop model",
    "a curve of flavor @xmath84 separating two neighboring sites does not necessarily separate two sites with different heights , for the definition of the rsos model in this case and its relation to the loop model see @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we summarize some simple examples including the most familiar minimal conformal models such as ising , tri - critical ising ,  3-state potts model and tri - critical  3-state potts model .",
    "the main point is to take the fusion graphs as adjacency graphs in the consistent way and to extract some loop models .",
    "these loop models are not equivalent to the corresponding conformal field theory but still carry some aspects of the underlying field theory in the consistent way , in particular the critical properties of these loop models are in close connection with the corresponding conformal field theory .    in this paper",
    "some distinctions are crucial .",
    "we have some minimal conformal field theories with well defined fusion matrices and modular invariant partition functions , one example is ising conformal field theory .",
    "there are some statistical models such as spin models , rsos models which at the critical point can be describe partially by the minimal cft , so the ising cft is different from the statistical ising model .",
    "we prefer also to distinguish between for example dilute ade models and dilute @xmath0 loop model .",
    "they can be mapped to each other and have the same phase transitions but since the fundamental objects in one side is local and in the other one is non - local this distinction is useful .",
    "there are lots of work done on connecting these two models , minimal conformal field theories and statistical models counterparts , using integrability methods and our argument hardly has something new to say from this point of view . finally we are defining another statistical model by using the fusion matrices of primary operators of conformal field theory which most of the times is in the same universality class as the statistical model counterpart of the corresponding cft .",
    "these height models have also loop representations .",
    "this similarity can be useful to get an idea about the loop properties of the statistical models with well - known minimal cfts .",
    "in this section we apply the method introduced in section  3 to the minimal conformal field theories with well defined fusion structure and also wzw @xmath85 models .",
    "we will also point on the consistency of these loop models with the cardy s boundary states .",
    "these consistency is a hint to believe that it may be possible to extend the results in to the level of the boundary partition function @xcite . for notational convenience in this section of the paper we will drop the hat of boundary operators .    ,",
    "@xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the graph of the operator @xmath86 is @xmath88 and the graph of @xmath87 is @xmath89,title=\"fig : \" ] +    * ising model * : the simplest example is the ising model @xmath90 since the model has diagonal modular invariant partition function the fusion matrices of the boundary operators is the same as the bulk case .",
    "the fusion graphs are as fig  2 so the boundary states are as follows latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 and @xmath189 are the intervals corresponding to branches  1 ,  2 ,  3 and  4 respectively .",
    "they coincide with the different branches in the dilute ade models .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the connection of the above loop model to the sle .",
    "there are different methods to do that here we use the magnetic operator to find the sle drift .",
    "it was shown in @xcite by the numerical calculation that the magnetic exponent of the branch  1 and  2 is identified with @xmath190 where    @xmath191    and @xmath176 is related to the central charge of the theory by @xmath192 .",
    "its connection to the loop variables comes from the relation @xmath193 derived from the coulomb gas method @xcite .",
    "the connection of the magnetic exponent to the sle drift is as follows @xcite @xmath194 using the above equation the sle drift at the branches  1 and  2 of the loop model ( [ partition function of generalized loop model ] ) can be derived as follows @xmath195 this result is consistent also with our expectation from the second level null vector of minimal models @xcite , it is also consistent with the recent direct investigation by using holomorphic variables @xcite .    back to the height model representation",
    "one can summarize following results : the branch  2 of the ade models corresponds to the dilute loops with @xmath196 and the branch  1 is the dense phase of tri - critical models with @xmath196 .",
    "the results for some of the simple cases are as follows : @xmath197    using the above method it is easy to find the lattice realization for most of the proposed loop models , the results are interestingly consistent . following the same method it is possible to extract the loop models corresponding to minimal cfts , however , the loop model for the non - diagonal cases with @xmath13 is not extractable with this method because we are not able to find the dense phase of loop models for these cases .",
    "it seems that the dense lattice height model has not been proposed for this case .    to conclude this subsection we proposed some loop representations for the minimal cfts by using fusion of boundary operators .",
    "then since ade models give a lattice statistical model representation for minimal cfts we used these models to extract physical loop models corresponding to ade models .",
    "the fractal properties of these lattice loop models are the same as the loop models that we proposed by using the fusion of primary operators .",
    "* @xmath85 models * : it is possible to follow the same calculation for every unitary minimal model .",
    "for example for wzw @xmath85 models the classification of modular invariant partition functions is based on a - d - e - t graphs with @xmath198 .",
    "the same method as the minimal models is applicable here and one can find boundary operators @xmath199 with @xmath200 .",
    "the loop models have weights @xmath201 .",
    "only @xmath202 has critical loop representation with the following loop weight @xmath203 with @xmath204 and @xmath205 for the dilute and dense phase respectively .",
    "the other loop models are not critical except for @xmath206 with @xmath207 .",
    "the fusion graphs of the operators with @xmath208 is not decomposable to the simple graphs , however , the non - largest eigenvalues can be still relevant .",
    "for example take @xmath209 with @xmath210 , the fusion graph is similar to the one part of the @xmath211 fusion graph of the tri - critical  3-state potts model , the right one in fig  6 .",
    "the eigenvalues are @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 , the last two cases have critical loop representation .",
    "the similarities between fusion graphs of @xmath85 models with minimal models is not just an accident they are based on the coset construction of the minimal models .",
    "we proposed a method to classify some possible loop models consistent with the conformal boundary conditions for generic rational cft : take the simply laced classification of the corresponding minimal cft then find the boundary operators and also the fusion matrices , make the @xmath0 loop model of the primary operator by the method that we discussed in section  3 and  @xcite .",
    "we think that there should be some connections between these loop models and the sle interpretation of cft investigated in @xcite which is based on the connection of sle with the null vectors in the cft .",
    "this connection is not complete even for minimal cfts because we do not know how to explain the boundary operators with the same loop model but with the different null vectors , for example in the three states potts model @xmath212 and @xmath124 are in the same sector from the boundary cft point of view but just @xmath86 and @xmath87 have the required second level null vectors .",
    "however , from null vector point of view this correspondence is not clear but it is possible to show that in the partition function level this similarity is more known .",
    "another way to look at the results of this paper is by conjecturing the largest eigenvalue of the fusion graph as the possible loop weight for the loop model in the universality class of the corresponding cft without defining any height model on the fusion graph",
    ".    one possible generalization of the above construction is by considering graphs with largest eigenvalue bigger than  2 as an adjacency graph of fused rsos model and then extracting the loop model by the method investigated in @xcite .",
    "the other interesting direction is to investigate the modular invariant partition functions of loop models and their possible connections to the classified modular invariant partition functions of minimal models , this is related to investigate more directly the connection of our method to the classification of @xcite .",
    "_ acknowledgment _ :    i thank roberto tateo for useful discussions and paul fendley for useful comments .",
    "i thank also john cardy for his useful criticism .",
    "+      in this appendix we list the fusion graphs of the boundary operators in tri - critical  3-state potts model .",
    "the fusion graphs are given in fig  6 .",
    "the fusion graph of @xmath213 can be derived from the fusion graph of the operator @xmath214 by the following transformations : @xmath215 the fusion graph of @xmath216 can be derived from the fusion graph of the operator @xmath158 by the following transformations : @xmath217 finally the fusion graph of @xmath218 can be derived from the fusion graph of the operator @xmath158 by the following transformations : @xmath219 to get the fusion graphs of @xmath166 and @xmath167 from the fusion graph of @xmath165 one just need to use the transformations ( [ transformations2 ] ) and ( [ transformations3 ] ) respectively .",
    "we shall call the part of the fusion graph of @xmath165 with two neighbor blobs @xmath220 , the lower index is the number of nodes and the upper index is the number of blobs attached to the neighboring nodes of the graphs starting from one of the extremes . these kinds of fusion graphs appear also in the fusion graph of @xmath221 of @xmath222 models .",
