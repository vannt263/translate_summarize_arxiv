    "this framing is called the blackboard framing .",
    "it allows us to view link diagrams as diagrams of framed links .",
    "the blackboard framing is invariant under the second and the third reidemeister moves , but not under the first reidemeister move .",
    "it is easy to see that two link diagrams describe isotopic framed links if and only the differ by a sequence of the following moves : the modified first reidemeister move r1 shown below ,    as well as the second and the third reidemeister move .",
    "a link diagram with marked points is a link diagram @xmath35 together with a finite collection of distinct points , lying on the interiors of the edges of @xmath35 , and labeled with @xmath281 or @xmath282 .",

    "the twist @xmath284 is the difference between the numbers of positive and negative marked points .",
    "a link diagram with marked points determines a framing @xmath285 of @xmath36 as follows : @xmath285 is given by a vector field which is perpendicular to the drawing plane , except in a small neighborhood of the marked points , where it twists around the link , such that each positive point contributes @xmath286 to @xmath287 and each negative point contributes @xmath288 to @xmath287 .",
    "thus we have @xmath289 .",
    "the marked first reidemeister move mr1 , shown above , leaves @xmath287 unchanged .",
    "it follows that two diagrams with marked points describe isotopic framed links if and only if they are related by a finite sequence of the following moves : marked first reidemeister move mr1 , reidemeister moves r2 and r3 , creation / annihilation of a pair of nearby oppositely marked points and sliding a marked point past a crossing .    8    8    figure 4 _ additional movie moves for framed cobordisms _      in this subsection , we discuss movie presentations for framed link cobordisms .",
    "let @xmath235 be an unframed cobordism , presented as a sequence of link diagrams .",

    "the framings of these links determine a well - defined framing of @xmath235 .",
    "we claim that every framing of @xmath235 arises in this way .",
    "to prove this claim , it would be sufficient to check that it is true for elementary cobordisms ( caps , cups and saddles ) .",
    "however , we give a different proof .",
    "the marked points in the movie presentation trace out curves on the cobordism @xmath235 ( note that these curves may have local extrema corresponding to annihilation and creation of marked points ) .",
    "we can orient these curves consistently , by declaring that positive points `` move '' in negative @xmath236 direction and negative points move in positive @xmath236 direction .",
    "conversely , if @xmath38 is an oriented simple closed curve on @xmath235 , we can think of @xmath38 as consisting of lines traced out by marked points .",
    "we can insert these marked points into a given movie presentation of @xmath235 .",
    "thus , @xmath38 acts on movie presentations of @xmath235 by insertion of marked points .",
    "this action induces an action on the framings of @xmath235 which are described by the movie presentations .",
    "it is easy to see that the action on the framings coincides with the action of @xmath266 discussed at the end of subsection [ flinks ] .",
    "since @xmath266 acts transitively , it follows that every framing of @xmath235 can be described by a movie presentation .",
    "moreover , two oriented simple closed curves induce equivalent actions on framings if and only if they are homologous .",
    "the local movie moves which are sufficient to relate any two homologous curves traced out by marked points on a cobordism are shown in figure 4 .",
    "these movie moves , together with modifications of the carter - saito movie moves obtained by inserting marked points , are sufficient to relate any two movie presentations of isotopic framed cobordisms .",
    "we can transform a link diagram with marked points into a link diagram without marked points by inserting a left  twist curl for each point marked with a @xmath281 and a right  twist curl for each point marked with a @xmath282 . under this substitution ,",
    "sliding a marked point past a crossing becomes a composition of the second and the third reidemeister move .",
    "the mr1 move and creation / annihilation of a pair of oppositely marked points become the modified first reidemeister move r1.    we can transform a movie presentation without marked points into a movie presentation with marked points as follows : we replace each r1 move by a composition of two opposite mr1 moves .",
    "the two opposite mr1 moves create a pair of oppositely marked points .",
    "we annihilate this pair immediately after its creation .",
    "the resulting movie presentation with marked points differs from the original movie presentation only locally .",
    "since we already know movie moves for movie presentations with marked points , we can define movie moves for movie presentations without marked points simply by replacing marked points with curls .",
    "let @xmath24 be the category of colored framed movie presentations .",
    "the objects are diagrams of colored links and the morphisms movie presentations of colored framed links , i.e. sequences of colored framed link diagrams , where between two consecutive diagrams one of the following transformations occur  r1 , r2 or r3 move , a saddle , a cap or a cup .",
    "note that here we need to distinguish between two saddle moves : a `` splitting '' saddle which splits one colored component into two of the same color , and a `` merging '' saddle which merges two components of _ the same color _ into one component . to components colored differently the merging saddle can not be applied .",

    "we obtain @xmath457 for @xmath458 and @xmath459 for @xmath460 .",
    "therefore @xmath461 for all @xmath462 , and hence @xmath463 .",
    "we do not know how to extend the original colored khovanov bracket @xmath122 to a functor from the category @xmath24 to the category @xmath29 .",
    "for this bracket , the morphisms @xmath330 induce chain transformations ( compare @xcite ) , but there is no choice of @xmath343 for which the morphisms @xmath341 induce chain transformations .",
    "by lee s theorem @xcite , the homology of @xmath464 has rank @xmath465 , where @xmath261 is the number of components of @xmath36 .",
    "the generators of lee homology are in bijection with the orientations of @xmath36 . hence , lee homology of a knot has two generators . in particular , the graded module associated to the lee homology of a knot",
    "has two homogeneous generators , whose topological degrees we denote by @xmath466 and @xmath467 .",
    "the rasmussen invariant @xmath468 of a knot @xmath112 is @xmath469    let us extend the rasmussen construction to links .",

    "let @xmath470 and @xmath471 be the generators of the lee homology corresponding to the orientation of @xmath36 and the opposite orientation , respectively .",
    "then by lemma 3.5 in @xcite , the filtered topological degrees of @xmath472 and @xmath473 differ by two modulo 4 .",
    "further , we can show that they differ by exactly two .",
    "indeed , a genus 1 cylinder cobordism induces an automorphism of @xmath464 of topological degree @xmath474 , which interchanges @xmath472 and @xmath473 .",

    "we will always assume that the orientations of @xmath479 and @xmath480 coincide with ones induced by @xmath235 , in the sense that @xmath481 .",
    "then the rasmussen estimate generalizes to [ re ]    characteristic of @xmath235 . indeed , arguing as in @xcite we obtain the estimate @xmath482 . by reflecting @xmath483",
    "$ ] along @xmath484 , we obtain a cobordism from @xmath480 to @xmath479 with the same euler characteristic as @xmath235 .",
    "this gives us the estimate @xmath485 .",
    "let @xmath490 and @xmath491 denote the orientations of @xmath492 and @xmath493 , respectively .",
    "the filtered modules @xmath494 and @xmath495 are isomorphic by an isomorphism which sends @xmath470 to @xmath496 .",
    "hence ( [ eunion ] ) follows from @xmath497 and @xmath498 ( cf .",
    "* corollary 3.6 ) ) .",
    "( [ esum ] ) follows from ( [ re ] ) and ( [ eunion ] ) because @xmath493 and @xmath499 are related by a saddle cobordism .",
    "similarly , ( [ emirror ] ) can be deduced from ( [ re ] ) and ( [ eunion ] ) because there is a cobordism , consisting of @xmath261 saddle cobordisms , which connects @xmath500 to the @xmath261component unlink .",
    "the notion of sliceness admits different generalizations to links .",
    "we say that an oriented link @xmath36 is slice in _ the weak sense _ if there exists an oriented smooth connected surface @xmath501 of genus zero , such that @xmath502 .",
    "@xmath36 is slice in _ the strong sense _ if every component bounds a disk in @xmath503 and all these disks are disjoint .",

    "tristram signature defined in @xcite is also an obstruction to sliceness .",
    "however , for knots with the trivial alexander polynomial , the levine ",
    "tristram signature is constant and equal to the ordinary signature .",
