    "quasars showing broad absorption troughs of resonance lines ( e.g. , , ) in their rest ultra violet spectra are called broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "bal quasars are classified into two categories , hibal and lobal quasars , depending on whether they show both high - ionization and low - ionization troughs or only low - ionization troughs .",
    "ionized wind from an accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is the most plausible candidate for the origin of bal to account for its high velocities ( several thousand km s@xmath2 to @xmath10.1@xmath3 typically ) . for the quasar sample from the sloan digital sky survey third data release ( sdss dr3 ; @xcite ) ,",
    "the fraction of bal quasars is 26% @xcite , which is a key to understanding the origin of bal quasars . to explain the fraction ,",
    "two scenarios have been proposed : an orientation scheme and an evolution scheme .    in the orientation scheme ,",
    "all quasars possess the agn wind and whether bal is observed or not can be attributed to the viewing angles to the sources .",
    "the agn wind is produced by radiation pressure nearly parallel to the disk @xcite , based on support in spectropolarimetry at rest ultra violet @xcite . in the model , bal troughs",
    "can only be seen in quasars whose edge - on disk wind points towards the observer .",
    "in contrast , @xcite found a number of radio - detected bal quasars showing rapid radio - flux variation which indicates a doppler beaming effect on pole - on viewed jets @xcite .",
    "moreover , widely distributed radio spectral indices also suggest that at least a portion of bal quasars are blazar - type objects with flat - spectrum radio cores .",
    "the simple orientation scheme might not explain all bal quasars .",
    "the evolution scheme ascribes the ratio of bal to non - bal quasars to the duration of time when quasars possess the agn wind @xcite .",
    "most bal quasars detected by the faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimeters survey ( first survey ; @xcite ) are point - like sources @xcite .",
    "the number of fanaroff - riley type - ii ( fr ii ; @xcite ) radio sources in bal quasars is roughly 10 times less common than that in all sdss quasars @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite reported that a significant fraction of bal quasars show radio spectra as found in gigahertz - peaked spectrum ( gps ) or compact steep spectrum ( css ) radio sources that are candidates for young radio sources @xcite .",
    "quasars might show their bal when they are young before they have large - scale jets .",
    "thus , radio observations to measure the age of a source is an important approach for understanding bal quasars in terms of the evolution scheme .",
    "in contrast to the above argument , gps / css sources as young radio sources are sometimes indistinguishable from blazars by radio observations with arcsecond scale resolution .",
    "usually , blazars have a flat or inverted spectrum up to high frequencies , while young radio sources have an optically thin steep spectrum in the gigahertz regime .",
    "however , blazars may show a convex spectrum similar to the gps spectrum during a flare .",
    "thus , observations with limited frequency coverage can not distinguish gps / css sources from blazars . even in these situations , blazars and",
    "young radio sources still display characteristics different from each other .",
    "blazars appear as one - sided structures in milli - arcsecond ( mas ) resolutions , long - term variability , and a high degree of polarization . on the other hand ,",
    "young radio sources have lobes with sub - relativistic speeds , which appear as two - sided structures in mas resolution , little variability , and little polarization .",
    "to distinguish blazars and young radio sources , high - resolution direct imaging is important .",
    "then , very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) is efficient to test the evolution scheme .",
    "in addition , vlbi is also one of the most direct ways to test the orientation scheme because radio structures on a mas scale include the information about the viewing angle .",
    "there have been several studies of bal quasars using vlbi .",
    "nonthermal jets and the agn wind coexist simultaneously at least in radio - loud bal quasars . furthermore , there are some inverted - spectrum sources , which are interpreted as young radio sources or doppler - beamed sources having pole - on - viewed relativistic jet @xcite .",
    "both one - sided and two - sided jet structures have been found .",
    "only one polarization study has been conducted by @xcite , which reported no difference in radio morphologies and polarization features between flat- and steep - spectrum sources .",
    "two sources were observed at more than three frequencies and show signatures of interaction with the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "@xcite reported disturbed morphology of j1048 + 3457 .",
    "@xcite discussed the ram pressure of the external medium on the mrk  231 radio source .",
    "thus far , general mas - scale radio properties of bal quasars are still unclear from the point of view of the orientation scheme and the evolution scheme .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report the result of multi - frequency polarimetric imaging observations using very long baseline array ( vlba ) for four radio - loud bal quasars with flat or inverted spectra on sub - arcsecond scale .",
    "we describe our sample sources in section  2 .",
    "the observation and data reduction are described in sections  3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "the results are presented in section  5 .",
    "we discuss the structures of parsec - scale radio jets and the agn wind , the orientation scheme , and the evolution scheme in section  6 .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in section  7 . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt a cosmology consistent with wmap results of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the angular scale of 1  mas corresponds to 8.4  parsec ( pc ) at the distances of our targets at @xmath7 .",
    "we selected a sample for the vlba observation from 20  sources detected in the first systematic vlbi observation at 8.4  ghz @xcite using the optically connected array for vlbi exploration project ( octave ; @xcite ) operated by the japanese vlbi network ( jvn ; @xcite ) .",
    "the octave sample consisted of sdss - dr3 bal quasars in @xcite , which hosted radio counterparts in the first survey with peak flux densities of more than 100  mjy .",
    "then , we selected the target sources that have ( i ) flux density of more than 100 mjy in the octave observation , ( ii ) expected polarized flux density of more than 1 mjy , and ( iii ) flat or inverted spectra , is defied as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the flux density at the frequency , @xmath10 . ] ( @xmath11 ) in @xcite .",
    "the sample is listed in table  [ tbl : sample ] .",
    "the multi - frequency polarimetric imaging was conducted at 1.7- , 5- , and 8-ghz bands using vlba on 2010 june 25 ( project code bd137 ) .",
    "the observation was carried out over 10  hours .",
    "each source was observed at the three bands with 610  minutes scan at 34 different hour angles .",
    "this leads to the quasi - similar @xmath12-@xmath13 coverages at each band .",
    "an aggregate bit rate of 128  mbps was used ; each band consisted of two 8-mhz wide , full polarization intermediate frequencies ( ifs ) centered at 1.663 and 1.671  ghz at 1.7-ghz band , 4.644 and 5.095  ghz at 5-ghz band , and 8.111 and 8.580  ghz at 8-ghz band .",
    "we integrated two ifs in each band to make stokes @xmath14 maps , while we produced the polarization map of each if separately .",
    "it is important to select a suitable setting for the ifs to determine @xmath15-@xmath16 ambiguity ( @xmath17 ) in polarization angle and to measure faraday rotation measure ( rm ) .",
    "the upper limit of measurable rm is determined by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the rm at the observer frame and the minimum separation of the square of observing wavelength , respectively .",
    "then , we obtain the maximum measurable rm as @xmath110,000  rad  m@xmath21 in the case of our setting . the maximum value at rest frame becomes @xmath190,000  rad  m@xmath21 for our sample sources at @xmath22 .",
    "data reduction was performed with a standard procedure using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ; @xcite ) software developed at the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) .",
    "amplitude calibration was performed using the measurements of system noise temperature during the observation and gains provided by each station .",
    "we also corrected the amplitude attenuation due to atmospheric opacity .",
    "fringe fitting was performed after the earth orientation parameters and ionospheric dispersive delay were corrected .",
    "finally , bandpass calibration for both amplitude and phase was performed .",
    "all sources were detected on all baselines at all frequencies except for the 1.7-ghz band at hancock station where system temperature was not obtained properly due to radio frequency interference .",
    "imaging processes were performed using the difmap software @xcite .",
    "we conducted self - calibration to derive the antenna - based amplitude corrections .",
    "the difmap does not solve for gain time variation for rr and ll visibilities separately .",
    "hence , we constructed rr or ll model by the difmap and then performed self - calibration for stokes @xmath14 by the aips , which corrects gain time variation for rr and ll visibilities separately @xcite .",
    "the error on the absolute flux density scale was generally @xmath15% .",
    "we corrected rl and lr delay offsets using the bright polarized source , j0854 + 2006 ( oj  287 ) , and corrected instrumental polarization ( @xmath23-term ) using the compact unpolarized source , j1407 + 2827 ( oq  208 ) .",
    "after @xmath23-term was calibrated , we confirmed that oq  208 had almost become unpolarized .",
    "we estimated the error on the absolute flux density scale for polarization was within 10% including residual @xmath23-term .",
    "an unknown phase offset between l and r polarizations for a reference antenna was corrected using the observed electric vector position angle ( evpa ) of j1310 + 3220 which was observed by evla at 5- and 8-ghz bands on 2010 july 15 and june 22 , respectively , under the project named tpol .",
    "each band consists of two 128-mhz wide ifs centered at 4.896 and 5.024  ghz at 5-ghz band , 8.395 and 8.523  ghz at 8-ghz band . using the data obtained by umrao",
    ", we confirmed that during the months of june and july there was no significant variability in their total flux densities , degree of polarization , and evpa .",
    "in addition , total and polarized flux density of j1310 + 3220 obtained by vlba were similar to that obtained by evla .",
    "we derived the integrated evpa for j1310 + 3220 at 1.7-ghz band by extrapolating from evpa at 5- and 8-ghz bands because evpa would be affected by rm .",
    "after the evpa correction , evpa of the other evpa calibrator , oj  287 , at 1.7-ghz band was consistent with that extrapolated from evpa at 5- and 8-ghz bands obtained using vlba ( figure  [ fig : evpacal ] ) .",
    "hence , our evpa calibrations seemed to be performed well .",
    "the errors of evpa are the root sum square of flux density measurement errors and fitting error to derive rm for the calibrator source .",
    "because polarimetry at low frequency is affected by ionospheric faraday rotation , we checked the total electron content of the ionosphere during our observation ; the typical variation of ionospheric rm within a scan was @xmath24  rad  m@xmath21 and between scans was @xmath25  rad  m@xmath21 .",
    "these values are equivalent to @xmath26  rad and @xmath27  rad at a wavelength of 20  cm , which do not affect the estimation of the evpa significantly even at 1.7-ghz band .",
    "stokes @xmath14 maps of the target sources at 1.663 , 4.644 , and 8.111  ghz are shown in figures  [ fig : j0928_i][fig : j1405_i ] .",

    "the geometry of the agn wind can be inferred from the viewing angle of the radio jet , which should be perpendicular to the innermost region of the accretion disk .",

    "these estimations give only mild constraints . according to the model presented by @xcite , the agn wind bends outward to an opening angle of 60  deg with a divergence of 6  deg to give a covering factor of @xmath110% .",
    "although our finding of blazar - type bal quasars strongly indicates pole - on - viewed agn , the derived inclinations are not strong constrains on the orientation of the agn wind in the framework of the orientation scheme .",
    "stronger constraints can be obtained in a future observation because the capability of this method depends on an image dynamic range .",
    "rm is related to physical properties through our line of sight as @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are strength of averaged magnetic field parallel to the line of sight and column density of thermal plasma , respectively . since rm is an integral quantity toward polarized sources , the observed rm comprises the contribution from the agn wind , foreground medium ( mainly galactic contribution ) , and magnetized plasma associated with a non - thermal jet ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "although we can not set constraints on the density of the agn wind because the rm contains the contribution from the plasma associated with the jet , further studies with multi - frequency radio polarimetric observations can provide the statistical estimates .      among four sources presented in this paper ,",
    "it is notable that j1159 + 0012 shows multiple components with the extension of more than 100  mas , which corresponds to the projected size of @xmath11  kpc .",
    "the bright central component with ghz - peaked spectrum can be interpreted as the core as often seen in the radio - loud quasars @xcite .",
    "however , this source apparently exhibits the emissions in both sides of the core while most of quasars show an one - side jet structure in vlbi - resolution scale .",
    "the components b  d are relatively brighter than component e , suggesting that these components are the approaching jet components and the components e is the receding jet component .",
    "the detection of the counter jet implies that the relativistic beaming is not significant at least in the component e. the most likely explanation is that the counter jet is decelerated at the component e as a result of jet termination",
    ". strong polarized emission ( @xmath69% ) is seen at the component d , and this polarized flux density constitutes the most of polarized flux density detected by vla .",
    "multi - frequency vla and single dish observations derived the intrinsic evpa of @xmath70  deg which was taken into account the faraday rotation @xcite .",
    "the resultant magnetic field direction is @xmath71  deg , which is nearly perpendicular to the position angle of approaching jet .",
    "since the polarized flux density detected by our vlba observations is almost equal to that by vla , this magnetic field direction represents the one at the component d. both strong polarized flux density and magnetic field perpendicular to the jet are consistent as if this feature results from the compression of random magnetic field @xcite , such as by shock .",
    "these evidences allow us to infer that the components d and e are hot spots produced by the jet termination by ism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is noted that the most of radio - loud quasars show two - sided structure at low frequencies @xcite .",
    "thus , the detection of the counter jet component in j1159 + 0012 is not surprising .",
    "the absence of counterpart of the components b and c is also naturally explained if both approaching and receding jets are still relativistic before reaching to the hot spots .",
    "one may think the lack of polarized emission from the component e is against above scenario but , if the component e possesses the similar level of fractional polarization with the component d , the polarized flux density is only @xmath11  mjy , which is too diffuse to be detected by our observation . besides",
    ", the counter jet component could be affected by rather significant faraday depolarization .",
    "we need polarization observation with higher sensitivity particularly at higher frequency to confirm the polarized emission from the component e.    this source shows point - like structure in arcsecond scale ( e.g. , first survey ; @xcite ) .",
    "two - sided structure with an angular size of about 200 mas , the same structure revealed by our observation , is seen on the image at 327  mhz by vlba @xcite , whose total flux density is comparable to that measured by the texas survey @xcite at 365  mhz .",
    "therefore , the most of radio emission originates in the structure between the components d and e. even if we assume a small viewing angle as usually inferred for the quasars , for instance 10 degree , total extent of these radio emissions is @xmath15  kpc .",
    "this source size is relatively compact as compared to the classical double radio galaxies .",
    "if we adopt typical hotspot velocity in young radio sources @xcite , the kinematic age of this source is @xmath1@xmath72@xmath73  year .",
    "the source might be the product of recent episode of jet activity .",
    "another possible explanation for the core - dominated morphology is the change in doppler factor and/or intrinsic jet power .",
    "one - sided structure represented by the components a1 and a2 both at 5 and 8  ghz ( see figure  [ fig : j1159_i ] ) in the core and two - sided morphology represented by the components d and e in larger scale can be interpreted by the change in the jet angle to the line of sight .",
    "such a change in jet angle can be attributed to the precession of the jet axis .",
    "one relevant observation is the bal quasar j1048 + 3457 .",
    "this source shows a distorted morphology , which is produced by the jet precession @xcite .",
    "in contrast , even if the doppler factor is constant with time , the brightness of the core ( the component a ) can also be explained by an increase in intrinsic luminosity of jets .",
    "the newly ejected component in the core represents that the source might now be in an active phase with an increase in the jet power . in this case , to form the much brighter core as compared to the extended emission , the activity should be intermittent .",
    "the activity of the core might cease after the components b  e were ejected .",
    "then , the time scale of the intermittency should be longer than the decay time of the extended components b  e ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the farthest ( or the oldest ) component is the brightest , and thus some ad hoc ingredients are needed to reconcile this with the intermittency .",
    "our vlba polarimetric imaging for four radio - loud bal quasars at 1.7 , 5 , and 8  ghz revealed the pc - scale radio structures of their non - thermal jets .",
    "j0928 + 446 , j1018 + 0530 , and j1405 + 4056 show one - sided structures in pc scales and polarized emissions in their cores .",
    "although radio flux variability is not confirmed in two - epoch observations , these characteristics are consistent with those of blazars .",
    "these three sources are presumably pole - on - viewed agns , although our observations with limited image qualities provided only mild constraints on viewing angles that are not sufficient to compete with the orientation scheme . on the other hand , j1159",
    "+ 0112 exhibits a two - sided structure across @xmath11  kpc and no significant polarization in its central component , which shows a inverted spectrum .",
    "these characteristics are consistent with those of young radio sources .",
    "the radio spectrum in the integrated flux density can be represented by a hybrid of a mhz - peaked spectrum component and a ghz - peaked spectrum component .",
    "there are still several possible explanations for the ghz - peaked component and thus further study ( e.g. , testing the variability ) is needed to uncover the nature of the source .",
    "we would like to acknowledge to g. bruni , k .- h .",
    "mack , f. m. montenegro - montes , k.  ohsuga , and k.  aoki for helpful discussions .",
    "kind advice concerning calibration of polarization with the evla data was given by j.  linford .",
    "vlba is a facility of nrao , operated by associated university inc .  under cooperative agreement with the national science foundation ( nsf ) .",
    "this work made use of the swinburne university of technology software correlator , developed as part of the australian major national research facilities programme and operated under license .",
    "this research has made use of the vla polarization monitoring program and the data from the umrao , which has been supported by the university of michigan and by a series of grants from the nsf .",
    "we also made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology .",
