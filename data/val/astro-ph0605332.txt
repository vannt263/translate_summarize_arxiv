    "after the work by @xcite , the possibility that gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) originate from a beamed emission has been one of the most debated issue about the nature of the grb sources in the current literature ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , on the ground of the theoretical considerations by @xcite , it was conjectured that , within the framework of a conical jet model , one may find that the gamma - ray energy released in all grbs is narrowly clustered around @xmath0 ergs @xcite .",
    "in a recent letter @xcite we analyzed the approximate power - law relations between the lorentz gamma factor and the radial coordinate usually adopted in the current grb literature .",
    "we pointed out how such relations are found to be mathematically correct but only approximately valid in a very limited range of the physical and astrophysical parameters and in an asymptotic regime which is reached only for a very short time , if any .",
    "therefore , such relations were there shown to be not applicable to grbs . instead , the exact analytic solutions of the equations of motion of a relativistic thin and uniform shell expanding in the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the fully radiative and adiabatic regimes were there presented .",
    "this program of identifying the exact analytic solutions instead of approximate power - law solution is in this letter carried one step forward . using the above exact solutions",
    ", we here introduce the exact analytic expressions of the relations between the detector arrival time @xmath1 of the grb afterglow radiation and the corresponding half - opening angle @xmath2 of the expanding source visible area due to the relativistic beaming ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such visible area must be computed not over the spherical surface of the shell , but over the equitemporal surface ( eqts ) of detector arrival time @xmath1 ,",
    "i.e. over the surface locus of points which are source of the radiation reaching the observer at the same arrival time @xmath1 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "the exact analytic expressions for the eqtss in grb afterglows , which have been presented in @xcite , are therefore crucial in our present derivation .",
    "this approach clearly differs from the ones in the current literature , which usually neglect the contributions of the radiation emitted from the entire eqts .",
    "the analytic relations between @xmath1 and @xmath2 presented in this letter allow to compute , assuming that the expanding shell is not spherically symmetric but is confined into a narrow jet with half - opening angle @xmath3 , the value @xmath4 of the detector arrival time at which we start to `` see '' the sides of the jet .",
    "a corresponding `` break '' in the observed light curve should occur later than @xmath4 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the current literature",
    ", @xmath4 is usually defined as the detector arrival time at which @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the lorentz factor of the expanding shell ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and also our eq.([sist ] ) below ) .",
    "in our formulation we do not consider effects of lateral spreadings of the jet .    in the current literature , in the case of adiabatic regime ,",
    "different approximate power - law relations between @xmath4 and @xmath3 have been presented , in contrast to each other ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we show here that in four specific cases of grbs , encompassing more than @xmath7 orders of magnitude in energy and more than @xmath8 orders of magnitude in ism density , both the one by @xcite and the one by @xcite overestimate the exact analytic result . a third relation just presented by @xcite",
    "slightly underestimate the exact analytic result .",
    "we also present an empirical fit of the numerical solutions of the exact equations for the adiabatic regime , compared and contrasted with the three above approximate relations . in the fully radiative regime , and therefore in the general case , no simple power - law relation of the kind found in the adiabatic regime can be established and the general approach we have outlined has to be followed .",
    "although evidence for spherically symmetric emission in grbs is emerging from observations @xcite and from theoretical argumentations @xcite , it is appropriate to develop here an exact theoretical treatment of the relation between @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "this will allow to make an assessment on the existence and , in the positive case , on the extent of beaming in grbs , which in turn is going to be essential for establishing their correct energetics .",
    "the boundary of the visible region of a relativistic thin and uniform shell expanding in the ism is defined by ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) : @xmath9 where @xmath2 is the angle between the line of sight and the radial expansion velocity of a point on the shell surface , @xmath10 is the velocity of the expanding shell and @xmath11 is the speed of light . to find the value of the half - opening beaming angle @xmath3 corresponding to an observed arrival time @xmath4",
