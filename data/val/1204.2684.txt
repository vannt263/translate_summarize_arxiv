    "it is known for quite sometime now that the degenerate fermi gas at low or zero temperature gives rise to phenomenon which is different from the normal fermi liquid behaviour once the magnetic interactions are included .",
    "this interesting feature is characterized by the appearance of anomalous logarithmic term in the expressions for various physical quantities like specific heat , entropy etc@xcite .",
    "it has also been revealed recently that at strictly zero temperature , there is a logarithmic singularity in the inverse group velocity , which leads to the breakdown of the usual fermi liquid picture in presence of the magnetic interactions .",
    "historically , such a deviation from the normal fermi liquid behavior was for the first time , exposed in @xcite , where , the specific heat of a degenerate gas due to the current - current interactions was calculated and the result contained the @xmath0 term which emanates from the unscreened magnetic interactions .",
    "it is to be mentioned here that non - fermi liquid behaviour of highly dense color superconducting qcd plasma has been studied in great detail @xcite .    for non - relativistic systems ,",
    "the magnetic interaction is suppressed in powers of @xmath1 and therefore might not be of much quantitative importance . however , for dense plasma where the constituents like quarks or electrons are moving with a velocity close to the velocity of light , the magnetic interactions can not be neglected .",
    "in fact , it has been revealed recently that in many context , the transverse interactions , due to its infrared sensitivity , may become more important than its longitudinal counterpart in this kinematic regime .",
    "for example , while calculating the fermion damping rate and energy loss , it has been shown in ref.@xcite that the leading order ( lo ) contributions come from the magnetic interaction while the longitudinal interactions contribute only at the sub leading order .",
    "in fact , it has been seen that the first two leading order contributions in the expressions for the fermion damping rate in ultradegenerate plasma come from the transverse sector alone .",
    "similar behaviour has also been reported in @xcite where the authors have studied the non - fermi liquid behaviour(nfl ) of the drag and diffusion coefficient in degenerate plasma . a more elaborate discussion on the nfl aspects of the cold and dense qed and qcd plasma has been presented in @xcite .",
    "this recently discovered phenomenon of non - fermi liquid behaviour , which relates itself to the modified quark dispersion relation for excitations close to the fermi surface , also finds important application in astrophysics .",
    "for example , it has been shown that the nfl corrections to the quark self - energy enhance the neutrino emissivity of ungapped quark matter which may exist in the core of neutron stars@xcite .",
    "like emissivity , in dense quark matter , the neutrino mean free path(mfp ) also receives significant nfl corrections as has been demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "it might be mentioned here that in all these calculations the evaluation of the quark self - energy was restricted to the leading logarithmic order . in @xcite ,",
    "on the other hand , the authors determine the quark dispersion relations in ultradegenerate relativistic plasmas beyond lo , which , at zero temperature , is characterized by the appearance of the fractional higher powers in the energy variable . in another work ,",
    "the specific heat of normal degenerate quark matter has also been calculated where also in the higher order terms the fractional powers show up @xcite .",
    "in view of these contemporary investigations , we here plan to evaluate the neutrino mfp and corresponding emissivity in normal degenerate quark matter beyond leading logarithmic order and compare with the lo results . here",
    "leading order ( lo ) refers to the anomalous logarithmic term @xmath2 that occurs as the first term in the non - fermi liquid contribution to the fermion self energy .",
    "quantities such as mean free path and emissivity calculated with this term is called the lo corrections .",
    "next to leading order ( nlo ) terms include all other terms beyond the lo that contain the fractional powers of t and up to the @xmath3 that occur in the expression of the fermion self energy .",
    "similarly , quantities calculated with this correction are labeled as nlo corrections @xcite .",
    "equipped with these results and knowing the specific heat of dense quark matter upto the order concerned , we investigate the cooling behaviour of the neutron star with dense quark core .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the formalism ; where we start with the quark dispersion relations and the modifications due to nfl effects followed by evaluation of the mfp for the degenerate and non - degenerate neutrinos .",
    "these are followed by the calculation of emissivity of the neutrinos .",
    "section iii is devoted to the study of the cooling process via neutrino emission .",
    "finally , the results are summarized in section iv followed by conclusion in section v.",
    "to calculate the quark dispersion relation in degenerate plasma one needs to evaluate the quark self - energy . for this",
    ", we consider fig.([fig1 ] ) , where the solid line represents the fermion propagator and the blob implies that the gluon propagator used here is hard dense loop ( hdl ) corrected propagator @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the quark self energy can be written as @xcite , @xmath4 where , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the matsubara frequencies for fermion and boson respectively with integers @xmath10 and @xmath11 . after performing the sum over matsubara frequency in eq.([sigma ] ) , @xmath12 is analytically continued to the minkowski space so that @xmath13@xcite .",
    "@xmath14 can be written as a combination of quasiparticle and antiquasiparticle self energies as@xcite , @xmath15 where @xmath16\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the energy projection operators are given by , _ * p*^=(1_0^i^i )    interactions within the medium severely modify the on - shell self - energy of the quarks which is manifested in the slope of the dispersion relation for the relativistic degenerate plasma .",
    "for quasi - particles with momenta close to the fermi momentum @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the quark flavor , the one - loop self - energy is dominated by the soft gluon exchanges @xcite . for the calculation of the mfp and emissivity one needs to know the modified dispersion relation which is determined as @xcite , _ = ( e_p ( _ ) + re_(_,p ( _ ) ) ) where @xmath19 is the quasiparticle / antiquasiparticle energy which is a solution of the dispersion relation and @xmath20 is the kinetic energy .",
    "as we are considering only quasiparticles , we will consider only @xmath21 and denote @xmath22 by @xmath19 .",
    "the above expression will be used to obtain @xmath23 needed for the phase space evaluation of the mean free path .",
    "the authors of @xcite have already calculated the fermion self energy with terms beyond lo .",

    "it is interesting to note here that at higher order , fractional powers in @xmath32 appear .",
    "this can be attributed to the dynamical screening for the transverse exchange of gauge bosons .",
    "the degenerate neutrinos refers to the case where the neutrino chemical potential ( @xmath33 ) is much larger than the temperature . in the interior of a neutron star , there are two distinct phenomena for which the neutrino mean free path is calculated , one is absorption and the other involves scattering of neutrinos @xcite . to calculate the mfp for the absorption process we consider the simplest @xmath34 decay reactions ; _",
    "i.e _ the absorption process and its inverse @xcite , d+_eu+e^- [ dir ] u+e^-d+_e .",
    "[ inv ] the corresponding mean free paths are denoted by @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the neutrino mfp is related to the total interaction rate due to neutrino emission averaged over the initial quark spins and summed over the final state phase space and spins .",

    "@xmath42 is the squared invariant amplitude and is given by @xmath43 . here",

    "we now consider the case of degenerate neutrinos _",
    "i.e. _ when @xmath45 .",
    "so in this case both the direct eq.([dir ] ) and inverse eq.([inv ] ) processes can occur .",

    "the leading order result is obtained as ,     arrive at the fermi - liquid result , one can use the free dispersion relation to arrive at , [ mfp_cond1 ] |_fl = g_f^2 ^ 2_c . since quarks and electrons",
    "are assumed to be massless , the chemical equilibrium condition gives @xmath53 , which we use to derive eq.([mfp_cond1 ] ) .",
    "we have further assumed that @xmath54 .",

    "in addition to the inclusion of the nlo terms , the fermi liquid term and lo term agrees with that of @xcite .",
    "we now derive mfp for nondegenerate neutrinos _",
    "i.e. _ when @xmath65 beyond the fermi - liquid contribution .",
    "for nondegenerate neutrinos the inverse process ( [ inv ] ) is dropped .",
    "we are considering only depopulation of neutrinos as in non - degenerate ( untrapped ) case repopulation or the reverse reaction is assumed to be zero .",
    "hence , we neglect the second term in the curly braces of eq.([mfp01])@xcite . for free quarks",
    ", the matrix element vanishes @xcite , since @xmath66 , @xmath67 quarks and electrons are collinear in momenta .",
    "the inclusion of strong interactions between quarks relaxes these kinematic restrictions resulting in a nonvanishing squared matrix amplitude .",
    "we can neglect the neutrino momentum in energy conserving relation due to the thermal production of the neutrinos @xcite .",
    "following the procedure described in @xcite the mfp for the fermi liquid case , lo and nlo are obtained as , [ mfp03 ] |_fl&=&g_f^2 ^ 2_c  _ d  _ u  _ e  ; |_log_f^2 ^ 2_c_e(g)^2 ( ) ;    and b_3=. similarly , for the scattering of nondegenerate neutrinos in quark matter with appropriate phase space corrections we obtain , [ mfp_scnd ] |_fl&=&n_q_ig_f^2 ; |_lo&&n_q_ig_f^2c_fg^2 ( ) ; |_nlo&&(c_v_i^2 + c_a_i^2)n_q_ig_f^2c_f , where the constants are , b_1= ; b_2=- and b_3=. here , we have assumed @xmath56",
    ". thus , the total mfp for non - degenerate neutrinos is obtained by summing up the contributions from the absorption and scattering parts to get the expression of the mfp of the non - degenerate neutrinos up to the nlo terms .",

    "the total emissivity of the non - degenerate neutrinos is obtained by multiplying the neutrino energy with the inverse of the mfp with appropriate factors and integrated over the neutrino momentum .",

    "it is to be noted that for excitations near the fermi surface , the angular integrals give no temperature dependence . now putting the standard values @xcite for the parameters ,",
    "the corrections can be compared with the results given in @xcite .",
    "the temperature of the neutron star with a quark matter core shows a dependency with time . to analyse the cooling of the star @xcite",

    "the nfl effects on the specific heat capacity of the degenerate quark matter has been calculated recently in @xcite .",

    "similar features have been observed in case of the mfp of non - degenerate neutrinos as displayed in fig.([fig3 ] ) .",
    "this marginal difference in the mfp between nfl lo and nlo corrections also leads to marginal difference in the emissivity for the two cases .",

    "we find that there is a modest increase in the emissivity of the neutrinos .",
    "the right panel of fig.([fig4 ] ) gives a comparison of the nfl corrections to the specific heat already reported in @xcite .",
    "the complicated cooling equation can not be solved analytically and we have resorted to numerical calculation .",
    "we observe that the cooling of neutron star is marginally faster in case of nfl ( nlo ) as compared to the fermi liquid result ( shown in fig.([fig5 ] ) ) .",
    "in this work , we have calculated the mfp of degenerate and non - degenerate neutrinos both for the scattering and absorption processes .",
    "we then find the expression for neutrino emissivity for non - degenerate neutrinos with nlo corrections .",
    "it is seen that both mfp and emissivity contain terms at the higher order which involve fractional powers in @xmath84 .",
    "we have found that there is a decrease in the mfp due to nlo corrections .",
    "we reconfirm that the leading order correction to the quantities like mfp or emissivity are significant compared to the fermi liquid results .",
    "the nlo corrections , which we derive here , have however been found to be numerically close to the lo results .",
    "we have also examined the cooling behavior of a neutron star by incorporating nlo correction to the specific heat and emissivity which affect the results considerably compared to the simple fermi liquid case .",
