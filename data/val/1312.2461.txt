    "note , however , that it is _ not _ equivalent to - since we are losing the information on the complete spin - vector density @xmath37 .",

    "then an elementary computation , using that @xmath12 is constant , shows that @xmath54 solves @xmath55 the second equation depends on @xmath56 only , which makes possible the application of a maximum principle .",
    "our first result is the global - in - time existence of weak solutions to - ( or equivalently , - ) under the assumption that the diffusion coefficient @xmath30 and the spin polarization @xmath28 are constant .",

    "if additionally @xmath74 , then @xmath75 .    for simplicity , the boundary data is assumed to be independent of time .",
    "the general situation can also be treated but is more technical ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the proof of the theorem is based on the leray - schauder fixed - point theorem .",
    "the key idea is to employ the variables @xmath76 for the ellipticity argument .",
    "more precisely , consider the main part of the differential operator in its weak formulation ( equation is divided by four ) , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is some test function .",

    "although the matrix is positive definite in the variables @xmath76 only , we achieve gradient estimates also for @xmath37 .",
    "this is the key estimate .",
    "note that the assumption that @xmath12 is constant is crucial here .",

    "the reason is that our proof is based on a truncation in the poisson equation ( see section [ sec.ex ] ) and not in the drift term as was done in , e.g.@xcite .",
    "this truncation yields @xmath93 regularity for the potential , but we lose the monotonicity of the nonlocal quadratic drift term .",

    "our second result is the existence of an entropy ( more precisely , free energy ) for the spinorial drift - diffusion system .",

    "the entropy is formulated in terms of the solution to - : @xmath101 the first two terms in the definition of @xmath102 describe the internal energy of the two spin components and the last term is the electric energy , relative to the boundary values . from the results on the standard drift - diffusion model ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , it is not surprising that the entropy @xmath103 is nonincreasing in time if the initial data are in thermal equilibrium .",
    "we say that @xmath104 is a thermal equilibrium state if @xmath105 for some constant @xmath106 and @xmath107 is the unique solution to @xmath108 for given @xmath109 , defined on @xmath110 and satisfying @xmath111 on @xmath110 , we extend these functions to @xmath112 by setting @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",

    "we need to suppose that @xmath128 to have well - posedness of the expression @xmath126 . because of the drift - diffusion structure of such a functional would be a natural candidate for an entropy .",
    "however , we will show that this may be not the case .",

    "we show in remark [ rem.neg ] that the integrand of the first integral may be negative for certain values of the variables .    in the special case @xmath130 and @xmath131 , which we assume in our numerical simulations in section [ sec.numer ] , the spin - vector density only depends on the third component , @xmath132 for all @xmath73 .",
