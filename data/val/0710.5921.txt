    "pattern formation in driven systems is an important direction of current research that influences many fields ranging from hydrodynamics to biophysics and from nonlinear optics to reaction kinetics ; see @xcite for a comprehensive review of the topic .",
    "some of the oldest and most well - known forms of such phenomena are the so - called faraday patterns , stemming from the classical studies of faraday in 1831 @xcite , who studied the behavior of  groups of particles [ placed ] upon vibrating elastic surfaces \" and ( in the appendix of his much - celebrated paper ) the dynamics of  fluids in contact with vibrating surfaces . \"",
    "faraday s experiment became a classical example of pattern formation , whereby the uniform state loses its stability against spatially modulated waveforms , whose dominant length - scale is determined by the intrinsic properties of the system ( such as the dominant wavelength of the instability ) and is only weakly dependent on boundary or initial conditions .    in the past few years",
    ", there has been an increasing literature about observing phenomena of the above type in driven superfluids .",
    "bose - einstein condensates @xcite offer perhaps the ideal playground for such experiments , since their experimental tunability permits to create such parametric resonance phenomena in a multiplicity of ways .",
    "one such way is by driving the magnetic trap confining the system , as was proposed in ref .  @xcite . in the same spirit of modulating the confinement of the system to observe parametric resonances , the works of refs .",
    "@xcite , motivated by the experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite , considered a periodic modulation of an optical lattice potential ; on the other hand , the later work of ref .",
    "@xcite focused on modulating in time the confinement potential in a toroidal trap .",
    "another recent suggestion was to produce a parametric drive by means of periodically modulating the scattering length @xcite , which is directly related to the prefactor of the effective nonlinearity ( due to the mean - field inter - particle interactions ) of the system .",
    "this can be achieved by means of feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "these theoretical propositions motivated the very recent experimental implementation of the faraday waves in bose - einstein condensates in the work of ref .",
    "the actual realization of the spatially modulated patterns arose in a somewhat different way than was proposed in the above studies , a way which is very close , however , to the spirit of the theoretical suggestion of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also the more recent consideration of a similar problem from a quantum point of view in ref .",
    "in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite , an elongated cigar - shaped condensate was used where the _ transverse _ , strong confinement directions were periodically modulated in time , while the weaker longitudinal direction confinement was time - independent .",
    "the parametric excitation at the driving frequency was recognized as being responsible for exciting oscillations at half the driving frequency , which is the main resonance also observed in faraday s experiments .",
    "subsequently , based on this insight and the dispersion relation of longitudinal collective modes presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , a relation was derived ( and convincingly compared to the experimental results in a quantitative manner ) for the resulting pattern periodicity versus the transverse driving frequency .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to provide a complete analysis of the instability from first principles and to obtain a fully analytical prediction that can be used for a detailed comparison with the experimental results and numerical results obtained from the 1d model reduction as well as full 3d simulations at the mean - field level .    the principal feature which allows us to provide a detailed quantitative analysis of the system is the fact that for cigar - shaped condensates ( such as the ones used in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite ) there is a quantitatively accurate description in the form of the non - polynomial schrdinger equation ( npse ) derived in ref .",
    "@xcite ( provided that the transverse direction stays close to its ground state , which is approximately the case in the experiments of ref .",
    "the remarkable feature of the npse is that in the resulting partial differential equation ( pde ) for the longitudinal description of the condensate , the transverse frequency enters explicitly and hence provides , in this setting , the explicit parametric drive that will lead to the observed spatially modulated patterns . to elucidate this feature",
    ", we will perform a linear stability analysis of the spatially uniform states in this effectively one - dimensional setting .",
    "this naturally leads to a mathieu equation .",
    "then , one can use the theory of the mathieu equation to identify the most unstable mode and the wavenumber ( and associated wavelength ) of its spatial periodicity .",
    "this , in turn , allows us to obtain a fully analytical expression for the pattern periodicity as a function of the driving frequency that can be directly compared with the experiment .",
    "we believe that this approach yields both qualitative and quantitative insight on the experiment and on the nature of the relevant phenomena .    our presentation will be structured as follows . in section",
    "ii , we develop our analytical approach and directly compare it with the experimental findings .",
    "in section iii , we complement our theoretical findings with numerical results simulating both the full 3d experimental setting and comparing it with results of its 1d analog , namely the npse equation . finally , in section iv , we summarize our findings and present some interesting directions for future work .",

    "it should be noted here that the radial profiles of high - density cigar - shaped condensates ( as the one in ref .",

    "while this introduces an element of approximation to the calculation below , the adjustable nature of the parameter @xmath11 ( which is always larger than the transverse oscillator length by a spatially dependent factor that depends on the longitudinal wavefunction ; see ref .",

    "the validity of this assumption for the present phenomenology is verified both a priori ( due to the very weak nature of the longitudinal confinement in comparison to the much stronger transverse confinement and its modulation ) and a posteriori ( from the comparison with the experimental results ) .",

    "[ fftnum ] ) , the faraday pattern contains a dominant peak with a respective finite width .",
    "the width of the peak indicates the presence of a _ range _ of spatial frequencies ( instead of a single one ) and thus we can associate an error bar to the average spacing by taking the width of the dominant peak as the variability in spatial frequencies .",

    "in this communication , we have revisited the topic of faraday waves and corresponding resonances in bose - einstein condensates . in particular ,",
    "we have focused on the experimentally relevant case where the transverse confinement is periodically modulated in time .",
    "we have used the non - polynomial schrdinger equation as a tool that permits to present in an explicit form this transverse modulation in an effective longitudinal equation describing the dynamics of the condensate wavefunction .",
    "then , a subsequent modulational stability analysis permitted us to examine the stability of spatially uniform states in this transversely driven , yet effectively one - dimensional setting .",
    "this analysis , leading to a mathieu equation , combined with the well - established theory of the latter equation allowed us to identify the dominant mode of the instability .",
    "this , in turn , led us to extract an explicit analytical formula that allows for this mode s wavenumber ( and hence its wavelength which is directly associated with the pattern periodicity and hence is an experimentally observable quantity ) as a function of the driving frequency of the transverse confining potential .",
    "direct comparison of the fully analytical result with the experimental observations confirmed the accuracy of our approach .",
    "these analytical and experimental results were also corroborated by numerical computations both within the framework of the one - dimensional npse equation , as well as for the case of the fully 3d gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "the similarities of the two regarding the instability length scale and the differences of the two in connection to the instability growth rate have been accordingly highlighted .",
    "these computations have allowed us to validate the quality of our theoretical approximations and give a detailed comparison between theory , numerics and experiment .",
    "there are numerous interesting possibilities that this experiment presents for future studies .",
    "one of them is to consider the predominantly two - dimensional case of pancake - shaped condensates , where , depending on the driving frequency , square or rhombic patterns may form . in that setting too , the effective wave equations of ref .  @xcite may allow to perform the modulational stability analysis and obtain a quantitative handle on the dominant unstable mode . on the other hand , modulations of all three spatial dimensions of the confining potential would be of interest in their own right . in the latter case , while reductions of the type used herein would not be relevant , nevertheless the dynamics may still be analytically describable upon appropriate assumptions , such as , e.g. , the quadratic phase assumption of ref .",
