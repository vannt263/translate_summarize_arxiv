    "the distortion of pulses propagating through waveguides arises due to dispersive spreading",
    ". however , if the waveguides is made using materials the refractive index of which depends nonlinearly on the intensity of the propagating pulses , it will be possible to compensate the effect of dispersion by a pulse - narrowing effect @xcite . a typical example in respect of this",
    "is provided by optical fibers . here",
    "the weak nonlinearity of the index of refraction arising due to kerr effect produces a self modulation which in turn causes steepening of the wave .",
    "the dynamical interplay between the dispersive and narrowing effects produces the so called optical solitons . for an isotropic medium with cubic nonlinearity",
    "the complex optical wave field @xmath0 is governed by the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls )    @xmath1    here @xmath2 stands for time and @xmath3 , the coordinate along the fiber .",
    "the suffixes @xmath3 and @xmath2 of @xmath4 denote partial derivatives with respect to these variables . in particular , @xmath5 .",
    "the main reason for the robustness of the solitons described by @xmath6 is that the wave numbers of the solitons lie in a range that is forbidden for the linear dispersive waves @xcite . as a result",
    ", linear wave can not be in resonance with the soliton to receive energy from the latter .",
    "we then have a stable soliton .",
    "the propagation of picosecond pulses is well described by the nls equation in @xmath6 which accounts for only the second - order dispersion and self modulation . but for femtosecond pulses another important physical effect namely , the third - order dispersion comes into play . in this case",
    "the appropriate evolution equation for the pulse propagation is given by @xcite @xmath7 understandably , the parameter @xmath8 is a measure of the perturbation caused by the third - order dispersion . due to the effect of perturbation",
    "a soliton could have wave numbers residing inside the linear spectrum of the system .",
    "such a soliton is called an embedded soliton @xcite .",
    "clearly , the embedded solitons can be in resonance with the perturbation to generate continuous wave radiation for subsequent decay . despite this , in certain parameter regimes these solitons can be stable @xcite . in view of this",
    "the stability analysis of embedded solitons arising in the solutions of higher - order nls equation has been subject of considerable current interest .",
    "the present work is an effort in this direction .",
    "studies in embedded solitons @xcite within the framework of a third - order nls equation indicate that these soliton exits as a continuous family .",
    "the members of the family being characterized by their propagation velocities are connected through a gauge transformation @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate the existance of such a family by using a straightforward analytical model and argue that embedded solitons can be fully stable despite their tendency to shed radiation .",
    "we believe that such an approach has distinct advantages to deal with physical problems because many unknown effects are then readily expressed and evaluated . to achieve our goal",
    "we shall derive a variational approach involving trial functions in order to describe the main characteristics of the embedded solitons as determined by the third - order nls equation in @xmath9 .",
    "although the chosen trial functions have a specific form , the shape parameters are allowed to evolve as the solitons propagate . with this assumtion",
    "the evolution equation under consideration simplifies to a reduced lagrangian problem @xcite .",
    "we shall try to study the stability of embedded solitons by taking variations of this lagrangian with respect to the shape parameters .",
    "for the nls equation in @xmath6 there exists a well - defined spectral problem @xcite such that one can write a closed form analytical solution of it in terms of sech functions .",
    "as opposed to this , the third - order nls equation can not be solved analytically . keeping this in view we look for a variational treatment of @xmath9 to find an accurate approximation solution . for our treatment",
    "we will essentially rely on a ritz optimization procedure @xcite applied to the lagrangian function for the nls equation in @xmath9 .",
    "we have found that the action functional @xmath10 with the lagrangian density @xmath11 reproduces the third - order nls equation via the hamilton s variational principle .    in the ritz optimization procedure , the first variation of the action functional is made to vanish for a suitable chosen trial function . in analogy with the well - known solution of @xmath6",
    "we introduce a sech type trial function @xmath12\\times \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\nonumber \\\\\\exp i\\left [ v(x)(t - y(x))+\\frac{b(x)}{2a(x)}\\left ( t - y(x)\\right)^2+\\sigma(x ) \\right ]   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are real functions of @xmath3 .",
    "the parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath16 are related to the three lowest - order moments of the @xmath4 envelope and represent respectively its amplitude , central position and width respectively .",
    "the other parameters @xmath18 , @xmath15 and @xmath17 stand for the phase , velocity ( centre of the soliton ) and frequency chirp .",
    "understandably , these parameters will all vary with the distance of propagation . using @xmath19 in @xmath20",
    "we get @xmath21 where    @xmath22    @xmath23    @xmath24sech^2\\left(\\frac{t - y}{a}\\right)\\ ] ]    and @xmath25    here the subscript @xmath26 on @xmath27 indicates that we have inserted the @xmath28 ansatz for @xmath0 into the lagrangian density . in terms of @xmath29",
    "the variational principle implied by @xmath30 leads to @xmath31 with @xmath32 we have found that result for @xmath33 is given by    @xmath34",
    "from the vanishing conditions of the variationals @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 we obtain the following equations .",
    "@xmath41    @xmath42    @xmath43    @xmath44    @xmath45    and @xmath46    from @xmath47    @xmath48    use of @xmath49 in @xmath50 gives @xmath51 again @xmath49 and @xmath52 give @xmath53 similarly from @xmath49 and @xmath54 we have @xmath55    subtracting @xmath56 from @xmath57 we write @xmath58 from @xmath49 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 we get a second - order differtial equation for the pulse width @xmath61 the first integral of @xmath62 gives @xmath63 where the potential field @xmath64 the constant of integration @xmath65 is determined by the initial conditions of @xmath62 .",
    "first from the initial conditions of @xmath62 written as @xmath66 and @xmath67 , we have @xmath68 using @xmath69 in @xmath70 we write @xmath71 we now introduce a normalized pulse width @xmath72 to rewrite @xmath73 as    @xmath74    with    @xmath75    and    @xmath76    the potential function @xmath77 vanishes for two values of @xmath78 , namely , @xmath79 and @xmath80 implying that there is a minimum in between these points .",
    "the point at which @xmath77 is minimum can be obtained from @xmath81 as @xmath82 in the limit when @xmath83 we have @xmath84 and @xmath85 . in this case",
    "the potential well degenerates into a single point such that a particle released at that point will stay there . in the context of this work , this signifies that a wave pulse for which @xmath83 propagates with unchanged shape as a cosequence of exact balance between nonlinear and dispersive effects .",
    "interestingly , we now have a continuous family of soliton solutions because @xmath86 depends on the continuous variable @xmath87 .",
    "this implies that in the neighbourhood of each embedded soliton there is another one having a slightly higher or lower energy .",
    "a particular embedded soliton when perturbed may always relax to the adjacent one .",
    "this makes an embedded soliton fully stable .    in fig .",
    "1 we plot the potential function @xmath77 as a function of @xmath78 for @xmath88 .",
    "each of these potentials has @xmath89 and is , therefore , associated with an embedded soliton .",
    "the solid curve @xmath90 is the potential function corresponding to the usual second - order nls equation while the dotted curves represent the potential functions of the embedded solitons as found in the solution of third - order nls equation . for @xmath91 ,",
    "the potential curves for the embedded solitons lie above the solid curve for @xmath92 . for @xmath93",
    "the dotted curves fall below the solid curve .",
    "we have drawn only a few curves for discrete values of @xmath94 . however , a dense set of curves can be drwan by varying @xmath94 continuously .",
