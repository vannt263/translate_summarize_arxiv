    "one of the most important predictions of modern theory of strong interactions , the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , is that in the processes occuring at high energies these interactions become perturbative @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is usually described by introducing an effective ( i.e.  running ) coupling parameter that is decreasing with increasing energy , and the theory is said to be asymptotically free .",
    "the energy dependent coupling parameter plays central role in the formulation of the so called renormalization group improved perturbation expansion , which is now a standard tool used to evaluate perturbative predictions for strong interaction effects . due to the asymptotic freedom property of qcd",
    "this renormalization group improved expansion works very well at high energies .",
    "however , already the early perturbative calculations of strong interaction effects in higher orders of perturbation expansion have shown that application of perturbative methods in qcd is more subtle than in other field theories .",
    "this is partially related to the fact that in qcd there is no unique and natural definition of the coupling parameter with a clear physical interpretation .",
    "there are many viable definitions of the coupling parameter in qcd , corresponding to different choices of the renormalization scheme ; each choice gives ( numerically ) a slightly different perturbative prediction , as was discussed in @xcite . in a given order of perturbation expansion this renormalization scheme",
    "( rs ) dependence of perturbative predictions is formally a higher order effect , and its significance diminishes at very large energies , where the running coupling parameter becomes small .",
    "it turns out , however , that in the region of moderate energies  say , of the order of few gev  the renormalization scheme dependence becomes numerically quite large , even with a conservative choice of the scheme parameters , as has been pointed out by the author of this report in @xcite .",
    "this is a rather unfortunate circumstance , because there are many strong interaction effects of considerable interest , for which the characteristic energy scale is not very high .",
    "another problem , which plagues the conventional renormalization group improved perturbation expansion at low and moderate energies is the presence of the so called landau singularity  the running coupling parameter may become infinite at some nonzero energy and then below this energy the perturbative predictions simply do not exist .",
    "various attempts have been made to improve the reliability of the qcd predictions at moderate energies . in the case of physical quantities defined at timelike momenta it was observed in @xcite that one may reduce the renormalization scheme dependence of the predictions by resumming some higher order corrections with the contour integral technique in the complex momentum space @xcite ; this was verified in detail in @xcite .",
    "other propositions included a resummation of the series expansion for physical quantities via the pad approximants @xcite ; modification of the expansion by enforcing certain analyticity properties in the complex energy plane @xcite ; and application of more complicated resummation methods @xcite .",
    "it appears , however , that neither of the proposed methods provides a complete and satisfactory solution of the problem .",
    "the aim of this report is to present an alternative approach .",
    "our starting point is the observation that strong rs dependence of perturbative predictions obtained in the conventional approach is largely a consequence of the very strong rs dependence of the conventional running coupling parameter .",
    "we propose therefore to introduce a modified running coupling parameter , obtained by integrating the renormalization group equation with a modified , nonpolynomial @xmath0-function .",
    "the sequence of modified @xmath0-function is a generalization of the sequence of polynomial @xmath0-function approximants used in the conventional expansion .",
    "this sequence is constructed in such a way so that the nonpolynomial approximants for each order satisfy certain general constraints and ensure the reduced renormalization scheme dependence of the effective coupling parameter . in particular ,",
    "they are chose to ensure the absence of singularity at nonzero positive energy .",
    "the modified perturbation expansion for physical quantities is then constructed by replacing the conventional coupling parameter by the modified running coupling parameter . using as an example the qcd effective charge appearing in the static interquark potential and the corrections to the gross - llewellyn - smith ( gls ) sum rule in deep inelastic neutrino - nucleon scattering ,",
    "we show that perturbative predictions obtained at moderate energies in such a modified expansion are much more stable with respect to change of the renormalization scheme .",
    "we also find that the predictions obtained from the modified expansion have a weaker dependence on the characteristic energy scale than the predictions obtained form the conventional expansion .",
    "making some fits to the experimental data for the gls sum rule we show that this effect might have interesting consequences for the qcd phenomenology .",
    "this report is organized as follows : to prepare the stage for further discussion , we briefly summarize in chapter 2 the main facts about the renormalization scheme dependence of the conventional perturbative predictions in qcd . as a concrete example , we discuss in detail the rs dependence of the perturbative expression for two quantities , the qcd effective charge related to the static interquark potential , and the qcd correction to the gls sum rule , in order to show explicitly that at moderate energies the rs dependence is indeed quite substantial .",
    "we then briefly discuss previous attempts to improve the reliability of perturbative qcd predictions . in chapter 3",
    "we describe the construction of an improved running coupling parameter that has much weaker rs dependence than the conventional coupling parameters .",
    "we first give some general constraints that such a modified coupling parameter should satisfy in order to give more stable predictions , and then we present a concrete model of the modified @xmath0-function . in chapter 4",
    "we discuss perturbative predictions for physical quantities , obtained with the modified coupling parameter in various renormalization schemes .",
    "in particular , we consider the defining equations for the so called principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) scheme in the modified expansion , which plays important role in our approach .",
    "an interesting aspect of our approach is that the sequence of the modified @xmath0-functions contains a free parameter , which gives us a natural way of utilizing the information of nonperturbative or phenomenological character to improve the accuracy of perturbative predictions in low orders of perturbations expansion .",
    "we propose certain procedure for fixing this parameter , involving phenomenological expression for the effective charge related to the interquark potential . in chapter 5",
    "we discuss the problem of uniqueness of the predictions obtained in the modified expansion : we consider an alternative model of the modified running coupling parameter and we evaluate perturbative predictions with this coupling parameter .",
    "we argue that predictions obtained in the modified expansion should be insensitive to the choice of the concrete form of the modified coupling parameter even in low orders of the perturbation expansion , provided that the pms scheme is used . in chapter 6",
    "we examine , how the use of the modified expansion might affect the qcd phenomenology .",
    "we give an argument that for all physical quantities ( that belong to the general class discussed in this report ) the modified predictions obtained in the pms scheme lie below the conventional pms predictions and evolve less rapidly as a function of the characteristic energy scale . using the qcd correction to the gls sum rule",
    "we illustrate that this might be a welcome trend , improving the consistency between low and high energy determinations of the strong coupling parameter . in the appendix",
    "a we give a solution of certain inequality , which is used to select ",
    "reasonable  scheme parameters in the discussion of the renormalization scheme dependence in chapter 2 . in the appendix",
    "b we describe yet another modified coupling parameter , which was not included in our analysis of perturbative predictions for physical quantities ; it is distinguished by the fact , that it is described by very simple formulas and may be interesting in its own right .",
    "basic ideas presented in this report have been previously communicated briefly by the author in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "all the symbolic and numerical calculations reported here have been performed with mathematica .",
    "in order to prepare the stage for further discussion and introduce appropriate notation let us recall some basic facts about the renormalization scheme dependence of perturbative qcd predictions in finite order of perturbation expansion .",
    "we shall concentrate on the class of simplest qcd predictions that may be expressed in the form of a dimensionless quantity @xmath1 depending on a single variable with dimension of @xmath2 , which we shall further denote as @xmath3 .",
    "we shall also assume that the effects of nonzero quark masses are approximated by the step - function @xmath3-dependence of the number @xmath4 of the `` active '' quark flavors , and we shall restrict our attention to the class of mass and gauge parameter independent renormalization schemes .",
    "under these assumptions the @xmath5-th order perturbative expression for @xmath1 may be written  apart from a multiplicative constant  in the form : @xmath6 , \\label{eq:201deltamu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the undetermined scale appearing in the process of renormalization and @xmath8 is the coupling parameter ( a  couplant  ) , related to the gauge coupling @xmath9 : @xmath10 .",
    "the couplant satisfies satisfying the @xmath5-th order renormalization group ( rg ) equation : @xmath11 .",
    "\\label{eq:203murge}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in equation ( [ eq:201deltamu ] ) we assumed that the expansion for @xmath1 starts with the couplant @xmath12 in the first power , which is the most common case .",
    "the expansion for @xmath1 may of course begin with @xmath13 , where @xmath14 ; it is straightforward to generalize our discussion to include this case , but we may also note that our considerations could be directly applied to @xmath15 . in the following we shall usually omit the index @xmath5 in @xmath16 , assuming that @xmath17 is always evaluated with the couplant satisfying the @xmath5-th order rg equation .",
    "we introduced here the  hat  notation in order to distinguish the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 from the corresponding parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the renormalization group improved expression for @xmath1 .    under the assumptions listed above the coefficients @xmath22 and",
    "@xmath23 in the @xmath0-function are ordinary numbers and the differential equation ( [ eq:203murge ] ) may be transformed into a transcendental equation of the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 . \\label{eq:207betint}\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath26 appearing in equation  ( [ eq:205murgint ] ) is the usual dimensional parameter used to distinguish between different integral curves of equation ( [ eq:203murge ] ) , and the arbitrary integration constant has been chosen according to the conventions set by @xcite .",
    "the role of subtractions introduced in the definition of the function @xmath27 is to make the integrand finite in the limit @xmath28 , which simplifies both analytic and numerical evaluation of the integral in various cases .",
    "the form of the coefficients @xmath29 is constrained by the fact that physical predictions of the theory should be ( at least formally ) independent of @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath30 under our assumptions the coefficients @xmath29 may be written in the form @xmath31 where the parameters @xmath32 are ordinary numbers .",
    "the results of perturbative qcd calculations are usually expressed in the modified minimal subtraction ( @xmath33 ) renormalization scheme @xcite , but there are many other possible renormalization schemes , which correspond to different choices of the finite parts of the renormalization constants .",
    "one may for example choose the momentum subtraction ( mom ) prescription @xcite , where the renormalized coupling constant is defined by absorbing radiative corrections to some vertex functions at certain configurations of the momenta .",
    "however , any choice of the finite parts of the renormalization constants leads to a well defined renormalized theory , so we may take a broader view that these finite parts may may be in principle arbitrary ; in other words , there is in fact a continuum of renormalization schemes @xcite .",
    "the coupling parameter in some general renormalization scheme x is related to the @xmath33 couplant by a finite renormalization : @xmath34 , \\label{eq:211finrena}\\ ] ] where the constants @xmath35 are related to the finite parts of the renormalization constants and in principle they may take arbitrary values .",
    "if the physical quantity @xmath1 is expanded in terms of @xmath36 , the expansion coefficients take the form : @xmath37 in general in the new scheme also the coefficients in the @xmath0-function would be different . under our assumptions the coefficients @xmath22 and @xmath38 are independent of the renormalization scheme , but the coefficients @xmath39 for @xmath40 are in general scheme dependent ; in the nnl order we have for example @xmath41 the change of the renormalization scheme affects also the parameter @xmath26 @xcite : @xmath42 this relation is _ exact _ to all orders of the perturbation expansion .    in the @xmath5-th order of the perturbation expansion we have @xmath5 parameters ( @xmath35 ) characterizing the freedom of choice of the renormalization scheme and @xmath43 expansion coefficients ( @xmath20 and @xmath23 ) , which depend on these parameters .",
    "it is clear therefore that the expansion coefficients are not totally independent  for @xmath44 there must be @xmath45 combinations of these coefficients , which are independent of the renormalization scheme @xcite .",
    "for @xmath46 the relevant scheme invariant combination may be written in the form : @xmath47 it should be noted that the invariant shown above corresponds to the definition adopted in @xcite , which is slightly different from the definition introduced in @xcite .",
    "it is not surprising that we have some freedom in defining the scheme invariant combinations of the expansion parameters , because any combination of the scheme invariants is of course itself a scheme invariant .",
    "it seems , however , that the invariants defined by @xcite give a more natural measure of the magnitude of the higher order radiative corrections .",
    "this may be seen in the following way : let us take for example the nnl order approximant @xmath48 , calculate the derivative @xmath49 and expand the result in terms of @xmath48 itself .",
    "we obtain @xmath50 .",
    "\\label{eq:220ec}\\ ] ] this looks very much like the renormalization group equation ( [ eq:203murge ] ) , except that instead of the coefficient @xmath51 we have the scheme invariant combination @xmath52 ( exactly in the form proposed in @xcite ) , while the higher order expansion coefficients @xmath53 in this expression are  of course  scheme dependent .",
    "if we would do the same calculation with @xmath54 , we would obtain a similar equation , where the coefficients _ up to and including _ the order @xmath55 would be the scheme invariants @xmath56 defined by @xcite , while the coefficients of higher order would be scheme dependent .",
    "this shows that the invariants proposed in @xcite have indeed some universal meaning .    in phenomenological applications",
    "it is usually assumed that renormalization scale @xmath7 is proportional to the characteristic energy scale of the process : @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is some constant . in this way",
    "we obtain the so called renormalization group improved expression for the physical quantity @xmath1 @xmath59 , \\label{eq:221dnrgim}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath20 are now independent of @xmath3 and in the arbitrary scheme x they take the form @xmath60 the whole @xmath3-dependence of @xmath1 comes then from the @xmath3-dependence of the couplant @xmath61 , which is determined by the implicit equation @xmath62 where we used the exact relation @xcite to introduce @xmath63 as a reference phenomenological parameter .",
    "the use of @xmath21 instead of @xmath19 in ( [ eq:221dnrgim ] ) is equivalent to resummation of some of the @xmath64 terms appearing in @xmath65 to all orders .",
    "of course @xmath66 satisfies the equation @xmath67    if we change the renormalization scheme , the finite renormalization of the couplant is compensated by the change in the coefficients @xmath20 , but in finite order of the perturbation expansion such compensation may be of course only approximate , so the actual numerical value obtained for @xmath17 does depend on the choice of renormalization scheme .",
    "the differences between values of @xmath17 calculated in various renormalization schemes are formally of the order @xmath68 , but numerically for @xmath3 of the order of few @xmath69 they may become quite significant , which creates a practical problem when we want to confront theoretical predictions with the experimental data .",
    "this is the problem that we want to address in this report .    in order to study the renormalization scheme dependence",
    "we need a convenient parameterization of the available degrees of freedom in choosing the perturbative approximants .",
    "the next - to - leading ( nl ) order approximants contain in principle two arbitrary parameters , @xmath70 and @xmath58 , which however appear in the expression for @xmath71 and in the equation ( [ eq:225intrgim ] ) in the combination @xmath72 .",
    "this means that in the nl order the freedom of choice of the approximants may be characterized by only one parameter ; we found it convenient to choose as such a parameter the coefficient @xmath73 in the renormalization group improved expression for @xmath1 .",
    "thus in the nl order we have : @xmath74 , \\label{eq:227d1con}\\ ] ] with @xmath75 determined by the equation @xmath76 where @xmath77    it should be emphasized , however , that although under our assumptions the parameters @xmath70 and @xmath58 have the same _ effect _ on @xmath71 , they have in fact a completely different character .",
    "for example , in a more general class of renormalization schemes the coefficient @xmath70 may depend on quark masses and the gauge parameter .",
    "the procedure of fixing the choice of the renormalization scheme ( i.e.  @xmath70 ) differs from the procedure of fixing the renormalization scale ( @xmath58 ) , even in the nl order .",
    "this observation has important consequences for the discussion of the ",
    "reasonable  schemes for nl order approximants .",
    "for example , it shows that there is no such a thing as a ",
    "reasonable  value of the scale parameter ; as has been emphasized in @xcite , a given value of @xmath73  which provides a unique specification of the nl order approximant  may correspond to a ",
    "reasonable  value of @xmath58 with one subtraction procedure ( say , @xmath33 ) , and a completely  unreasonable  value of @xmath58 in a scheme defined by some other subtraction procedure ( for example momentum subtraction ) .    in the next - to - next - to - leading ( nnl ) order",
    "there appears an additional degree of freedom in choosing the renormalization scheme , corresponding the freedom of choice of the parameter @xmath78 .",
    "following @xcite we shall parameterize this degree of freedom by the coefficient @xmath51 in the nnl order @xmath0-function .",
    "if the parameters @xmath73 and @xmath51 are fixed , the value of the coefficient @xmath79 may be determined from the scheme invariant combination @xmath52 : @xmath80 thus in the nnl order we have : @xmath81 , \\label{eq:231d2con}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is determined by the equation @xmath83 where again we have shown explicitly the dependence of various terms on the scheme parameters @xmath73 and @xmath51 . for @xmath84",
    "the function @xmath85 has the form : @xmath86 the expression for @xmath85 for other values of @xmath51 may obtained via analytic continuation in @xmath51 .",
    "the coefficients of the @xmath0-function have the following values : @xmath87 @xcite , @xmath88 @xcite and @xcite @xmath89      besides the @xmath33 @xcite and the momentum subtraction schemes @xcite there were other propositions concerning the optimal way to choose the renormalization scheme .",
    "we now briefly review major approaches that have been considered .",
    "an interesting proposition , directly referring to diagrammatic calculations and motivated by analogy with qed , was formulated in @xcite : it was proposed to choose the renormalization scale ( represented in our notation by the coefficient @xmath58 ) in the nl order expression in such a way that the contribution to the physical quantity from the vacuum polarization effects due to quarks ( represented in the coefficient @xmath90 in the formula ( [ eq:209genr1 ] ) by the term depending on the number @xmath91 of  active  quarks ) is absorbed into the definition of the renormalized coupling constant ( via the @xmath91-dependent term in the coefficient @xmath22 ) . extensions of this so called blm procedure to the case of scale fixing in the presence of some higher order corrections were discussed in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it proved difficult to extend the blm method to higher orders in such a way that it would lead to a unique choice of all the renormalization scheme parameters relevant in the given order of the perturbation expansion , as was discussed in @xcite .",
    "a more radical proposition , originating from the work of @xcite , was to choose the constants @xmath92 in the equation ( [ eq:211finrena ] ) in such a way that all the expansion coefficients @xmath20 in the @xmath5-th order approximant @xmath17 for the physical quantity @xmath1 are identically zero , @xmath93 , without any reference to any explicit subtraction procedure .",
    "in other words , in this scheme the renormalized couplant coincides with the physical quantity @xmath1 . in our parameterization",
    "this corresponds to the choice of the scheme parameters @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "this choice was dubbed in @xcite the fastest apparent convergence ( fac ) scheme .",
    "another interesting proposition was to choose the scheme parameters according to the so called principle of minimal sensitivity @xcite ( for a more recent discussion see @xcite ) : since the physical predictions of the theory should in principle be independent of the choice of the renormalization scheme , we should give preference to those values of the scheme parameters , for which the finite order perturbative predictions are least sensitive to the local changes in these parameters .",
    "since this approach would play an important role in our further discussion , and our parameterization of the scheme dependence is slightly different from that assumed in the original paper @xcite , we shall describe it here in some detail .    in the nl order the scheme parameter @xmath96",
    "corresponding to the pms scheme is a solution of the equation : @xmath97 where we emphasized the fact that @xmath71 depends on @xmath73 both explicitly and implicitly via the @xmath73-dependence of @xmath21 . performing the differentiation and taking into account that in the nl order we have @xmath98 we obtain @xmath99 solving this equation for @xmath96 we find @xmath100 inserting this expression into the equation ( [ eq:229a1con ] ) for the nl order couplant we obtain a transcendental equation for @xmath101 . solving this equation we obtain the numerical value of @xmath101 for the chosen value of @xmath102 , which then allows us to determine the numerical value of @xmath103 , and hence the numerical value of @xmath71 in the pms scheme for this @xmath102 . for small @xmath101 ( i.e.  for large @xmath102 ) we may use an approximate expression for @xmath103 : @xmath104    in the nnl order",
    "the parameters @xmath96 and @xmath105 corresponding to the pms scheme are solutions of the system of two equations : @xmath106 and @xmath107 where it is understood that in performing partial differentiation of @xmath48 over @xmath73 and @xmath51 also of the implicit dependence of @xmath108 on these parameters is taken into account . in the nnl order",
    "we have @xmath109 so the partial derivative over @xmath110 has the form : @xmath111 the equation ( [ eq:243dd2dr1 ] ) is therefore equivalent to : @xmath112 where in the @xmath113 term we expressed @xmath114 in terms of @xmath103 and @xmath115 .",
    "the partial derivative of @xmath48 over @xmath116 has the form : @xmath117 where @xmath118 more explicitly @xmath119 where for @xmath120 we have @xmath121 .",
    "\\label{eq:251da2condc2h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for other values of @xmath51 the relevant expression is obtained via analytic continuation in @xmath51 .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath122 .",
    "the equation ( [ eq:245dd2dc2 ] ) for the pms parameters may be therefore written in the form @xmath123    solving the pms equations ( [ eq:247d2pmseqr1 ] ) and ( [ eq:253d2pmseqc2 ] ) we obtain the parameters @xmath96 and @xmath105 singled out by the pms method , expressed in terms of @xmath101 . inserting this solution into the implicit equation for the nnl order couplant ( [ eq:233a2con ] ) we obtain the parameter @xmath101 for the chosen value of @xmath102 . inserting these values into the expression ( [ eq:231d2con ] )",
    "we then obtain the pms prediction for @xmath48 at this @xmath102 .",
    "the equations ( [ eq:247d2pmseqr1 ] ) and ( [ eq:253d2pmseqc2 ] ) are quite complicated , but for small @xmath101 ( i.e.  for large @xmath102 ) it is easy to solve them in an approximate way @xcite . if we look for @xmath96 and @xmath105 in the form of a series expansion in @xmath101 , then from ( [ eq:253d2pmseqc2 ] ) we see , that @xmath124 from ( [ eq:247d2pmseqr1 ] ) we then immediately find that @xmath125    the choice of the pms scheme has nice conceptual motivation , but it may be also advantageous from the point of view of resummation of the perturbation series . as is well known , the perturbation series in qcd is only asymptotic ( i.e.  its radius of convergence is equal to zero ) and a straightforward summation of successive corrections in any fixed renormalization scheme must inevitably give infinite result .",
    "one may nevertheless give meaning to the sum of such divergent series by applying various summation methods , such as the method based on the borel transform .",
    "in @xcite it was conjectured that the pms method  which involves a  floating  choice of the scheme parameters , depending on the energy and the order of the expansion  could provide an  automatic  resummation method , which would convert a divergent series expansion into a convergent sequence of nonpolynomial approximants .",
    "this idea was further discussed in @xcite .",
    "although in the case of realistic qcd series this conjecture is far from being proved or disproved , it has been known for a long time that re - expansion procedures based on the introduction of some auxiliary parameters , which are  floating  ,",
    "i.e.  they are fixed in an order dependent way , could indeed provide an effective resummation method for divergent series .",
    "for example in @xcite a rigorous proof has been given that a method based on an order dependent mapping gives convergent results in the case of the factorially divergent expansion of a one dimensional non - gaussian integral , and a compelling numerical evidence has been obtained that the same is true in the case of the divergent perturbation expansion for the ground state of the anharmonic oscillator ; in a numerical study of the anharmonic oscillator presented in @xcite it has been shown , that a sequence of approximants constructed according to the minimal sensitivity criteria seems to be convergent ; finally , in @xcite a method for improving the perturbation series for the anharmonic oscillator has been proposed , which involves order dependent choice of certain parameters , and it has been proved , that it results in a convergent sequence .",
    "for all these model divergent series rigorous proofs have been obtained , that the resummation methods based on the pms criteria do indeed give convergent results @xcite .",
    "regardless of the ingenuity of various propositions for the optimal choice of the renormalization scheme one can not escape the fact that they are ( at least so far ) of heuristic character . in the scheme parameter space in the vicinity of the  optimal  schemes we have many other schemes , which _ a priori _ look equally reasonable ; predictions in such schemes also should be somehow taken into account .",
    "unfortunately , even if we restrict ourselves to  reasonably  looking schemes , the variation of the predictions obtained from the conventional perturbation expansion at moderate energies appears to be quite large .",
    "we illustrate this problem in the following sections .",
    "before we move on , let us comment on a completely different strategy of evaluating perturbative qcd predictions , i.e.  the so called method of effective charges , originating from the works of @xcite and recently further developed in @xcite . in its simplest form",
    "this approach is based on the manifestly rs independent evolution equation for @xmath126 , @xmath127 .",
    "\\label{eq:257ec}\\ ] ] which is obtained by taking the limit @xmath128 in the equation ( [ eq:220ec ] ) .",
    "the great advantage of this approach is that the generator of the evolution for @xmath126 is a scheme independent object , so all the scheme dependence of perturbative predictions is apparently absent in this formulation from the very beginning .",
    "let us note , however , that if we use as an expression for the generator a simple truncated series in the given order , we end up with the expression coinciding with the formula obtained in the fac scheme ; this expression can not be considered completely satisfactory , for example because it suffers from the landau singularity problem ( at least for physical quantities with positive @xmath129 ) . on the other hand , if we try to improve the series expansion for the generator via some sequence of nonpolynomial approximants , then in the low orders we encounter the problem of arbitrariness in the choice of these approximants , which has a similar effect on the predictions as the effect of arbitrariness in the choice of the renormalization scheme in the usual expansion in terms of the effective couplant .",
    "another drawback of this approach is that there are physical quantities , which can not be easily expressed in terms of simple effective charges .",
    "it seems , therefore , that this approach can not compete at present with the commonly used expansion in terms of an effective couplant .",
    "another interesting manifestly scheme independent approach has been developed in @xcite , where authors propose to make a direct comparison of physical quantities .",
    "the attractive feature of this approach is that by expanding one physical quantity in terms of another physical quantity one may avoid to some extent the complications arising from the scheme dependence .",
    "it was also observed that relating physical quantities at appropriately chosen energy scales  called by authors  commensurate scales ",
    " one may eliminate large contributions to the expansion coefficients that arise from the terms that explicitly depend on the @xmath0-function coefficients .",
    "unfortunately , results obtained with commensurate scale relations can not be easily combined with the results obtained in the more conventional approaches to the qcd phenomenology . in particular , in order to achieve their goals , authors of @xcite adopt a somewhat unusual multi - scale method , evaluating _ each term _ of the series expansion at a different energy scale .",
    "the fact that finite order perturbative predictions obtained with the conventional perturbation expansion exhibit at moderate energies a strong dependence on the choice of the renormalization scheme , despite a conservative choice of the scheme parameters , has been demonstrated in several articles @xcite . as a preparation for further discussion",
    "we illustrate this effect once again , using as an example the perturbative qcd expression for the effective charge @xmath130 , appearing in the static interquark interaction potential @xcite . to our knowledge",
    ", a complete analysis of the rs dependence of @xmath130 has not been performed so far .",

    "the pad approximants , being rational functions , tend to develop singularities for some particular values of the scheme parameters .",
    "it also seems that the character of divergence of the qcd perturbation expansion at high orders is such that it can not be resummed by approximants of this type @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the  analytization  procedure introduces some essentially nonperturbative contributions ( required to cancel the unphysical singularities of the conventional perturbative approximants  as may be seen in the formula shown above ) , which generate @xmath197 corrections at moderately large @xmath3 .",
    "these corrections are troublesome , because for some physical quantities  such as the @xmath182 ratio  they are incompatible with the operator product expansion , and for other quantities  like @xmath164  such corrections interfere with the available estimates of nonperturbative contributions , causing a double counting problem .",
    "the  analytization  procedure also introduces a very strong modification of the low-@xmath3 behaviour , making all the expressions _ finite _ at @xmath198",
    " and this modification is very  rigid  , i.e.  it is uniquely defined by the weak coupling properties of the theory , which is slightly suspicious .",
    "finally , if we decide to apply the , , analytization  procedure directly to physical quantities , then we effectively abandon the concept of expressing all the predictions of the theory in terms of one universal effective coupling parameter .    in this note",
    "we make an attempt to formulate an alternative method for improving perturbative qcd approximants , which gives more reliable results than the conventional expansion and yet at the same time does not depart too far from the standard perturbative framework .",
    "a closer look at the conventional rg improved expansion immediately reveals that one of the main reasons for the significant rs dependence of finite order predictions is the very strong rs dependence of the running coupling parameter itself .",
    "an extreme manifestation of this scheme dependence is the fact that in a large class of schemes the couplant becomes singular at finite nonzero @xmath3 , with the location and the character of the singularity depending on the choice of the scheme . in the nl order",

    "although the singularity itself occurs in the range of @xmath3 which is normally thought to belong to the nonperturbative regime , its strong rs dependence affects also the behaviour of the couplant at @xmath3 above the singularity , resulting in a strong rs dependence of the running coupling parameter for those values of @xmath3 that lie in the perturbative domain , which can not be properly compensated by the corresponding changes in the expansion coefficients @xmath20 .",
    "it seems unlikely that one would be able to improve stability of the perturbative predictions in a significant way without somehow solving this problem .",
    "fortunately , within the perturbative approach we have some freedom in defining the actual expansion parameter .",
    "the idea is then to exploit this freedom and try to construct an alternative couplant , which would be much less scheme dependent than the conventional couplant , hopefully giving also much less rs dependent predictions for physical quantities . from the preceding discussion it is obvious that first of all we would like this modified couplant to be free from the landau singularity .",
    "the idea of modifying the effective coupling parameter @xmath21 in order to remove the landau singularity has of course a long history , dating back to the early days of qcd @xcite .",
    "it turns out , however , that various proposed models  although very inspiring  are not directly useful from our point of view .",
    "let us formulate more explicitly the conditions that the modified couplant should satisfy in order to be suitable for our approach .",
    "our first constraints are related to our assumption that we want to stay as close as possible to the usual perturbative framework .",
    "this means in particular that we want to retain the concept of an effective coupling parameter satisfying the renormalization group equation , although the conventional , polynomial generator @xmath210 in this equation would have to be replaced by an appropriately chosen nonpolynomial function @xmath211 .",
    "first of all , in order to ensure the perturbative consistency of the modified perturbation expansion with the conventional expansion in the n - th order we shall require    ( i ) : :    @xmath212    if this condition is satisfied , then the expression obtained by replacing the conventional couplant @xmath66 in the expansion for @xmath17 by the modified couplant @xmath213 ( we may temporarily denote such an expression as @xmath214 ) differs from the original expression only by terms that are formally of higher order than the highest order term retained in the conventional approximant .",
    "secondly , in order to ensure that the modified running coupling parameter remains nonsingular for all real positive @xmath3 , we shall require that :    ( iia ) : :    @xmath215 is negative and nonsingular for    all real positive @xmath12 and for    @xmath216 it behaves like    @xmath217 , where    @xmath218 is a positive constant and @xmath219 ,    or    ( iib ) : :    @xmath215 has zero for real positive    @xmath220 and is negative and nonsingular for    @xmath221 .",

    "unfortunately , such models usually generate @xmath227 corrections at large @xmath3 , which are unwelcome .",

    "the conditions ( i)-(iv ) are rather general , so that at any given order there are many functions satisfying these criteria .",

    "one may restrict this freedom by fixing these parameters with help of some information coming from outside of perturbation theory .",

    "for this reason we shall further restrict the class of possible functions @xmath215 .",
    "we shall require , that :    ( v ) : :    @xmath215 should not contain free    parameters specific to some particular order of the expansion    ( i.e.  @xmath5 ) .    in other words ,",

    "the simplest idea is to use the pad approximant . in the nl order",
    "we then obtain @xmath236 unfortunately , this expression becomes _ singular _ for real positive @xmath12 , so there would not be much of an improvement in the behaviour of @xmath12 . in higher orders the situation becomes even worse  not only the pad approximants develop singularities for real positive @xmath12 , but also the locations of these singularities are scheme dependent . for example , the [ 1/1 ] approximant in the nnl order has the form : @xmath237 this shows that in order to obtain a satisfactory model @xmath0-function one has to go beyond the straightforward pad approximants or their simple modifications .",

    "from the way we introduced the modified couplant it is clear that the sum of the perturbation series should be independent of @xmath245 , but this statement requires some comments .",
    "first of all , the perturbation expansion in qcd is divergent , so in order to achieve the @xmath245-independence we would have to use an appropriate summation method . as mentioned in section  2.2",
    ", there is a possibility , that in the case of qcd such a summation method may be provided by the pms approach , which motivates us to give some preference to the modified pms approximants when considering phenomenological applications of the the modified expansion .",
    "secondly , in fact we _ do _ expect some @xmath245-dependence even if the perturbation series is resummed to all orders .",
    "this is because for @xmath299 ,",
    "i.e.  in the conventional expansion , there are whole classes of schemes , for which resummation of the perturbation series for the physical quantity can not give a satisfactory result , because it is unlikely that it would remove the landau singularity in the @xmath102-dependence of the couplant ; one example of such a scheme is the so called t  hooft scheme , in which all the @xmath0-function coefficients beyond the nl order are chosen to be identically equal to zero : @xmath300 for @xmath301 . on the other hand , if @xmath302 , then perturbative predictions are _ finite _ for _ all _ positive values of @xmath102 , and one may reasonably expect that the resummed series would give an expression that does not suffer from the landau singularity problem .    even if we use some resummation procedure , the low order approximants",
    "do depend on @xmath245 .",
    "it should be stressed that such dependence may be in fact seen as an advantage of the modified expansion , because it may be used to improve the accuracy of the predictions by incorporating some information outside of perturbation theory .",
    "this may be achieved for example by adjusting @xmath245 to match some phenomenological or nonperturbative results for some important physical quantity .",
    "ideally one would want to use some results obtained from first principles , for example in the lattice approach , but this is a complicated subject , so as a first try we use in this report a much simpler condition that relies on a phenomenological formula for @xmath130 @xcite that has had some success in correlating the experimental data for heavy quarkonia .",

    "was recently discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , authors of @xcite incorporate in their formula a large nnl order correction and use as a constraint in the fit a rather large value of @xmath313 , so we decided to use the older expression ( [ eq:411bgt ] ) . in any case",

    "the concrete procedure that we use to fix @xmath245 is the following : we assume that the modified predictions for @xmath314 coincide with the value given by the phenomenological expression ( [ eq:411bgt ] ) at @xmath162 , i.e.  at the upper boundary of the @xmath143 region ( which is achieved by adjusting the parameter @xmath63 in the expression for @xmath130 ) and we adjust @xmath245 so as to obtain the best possible agreement between these two expressions at lower @xmath3 , down to @xmath315 . to perform this matching procedure we use the predictions for @xmath135 in the pms scheme .",

    "this effect is of course not unexpected , since the initial motivation for our construction of the modified expansion was exactly to reduce the rate of growth of the couplant with decreasing @xmath102 in some schemes and to eliminate the singularity at positive @xmath3 . on the other hand , this effect is not entirely trivial , because there is no immediate relation between the low-@xmath3 behaviour of the couplant in any particular scheme and the low-@xmath3 behaviour of the pms approximants : firstly , in some renormalization schemes the modified predictions lie _ above _ the conventional predictions , as may be seen for example in figure [ fig:11dve1r1 ] , and secondly , the pms scheme parameters for the modified approximants are different from the pms parameters of the conventional approximants . if such a pattern would be observed for all physical quantities , it might have important consequences for phenomenology .",
    "it is therefore of some interest to investigate , whether we may support our observation by some general arguments .",
    "an ideal solution would be to give some rigorous bounds on the pms predictions in the modified expansion , but this seems to be a rather difficult problem .",
    "we shall therefore adopt a less ambitious approach : in order to compare the modified pms predictions with the conventional pms predictions in a given order we shall expand both expressions in terms of a new couplant @xmath220 , defined by the implicit equation : @xmath354 where @xmath355 denotes as usual the first expansion coefficient for the considered physical quantity in the @xmath33 scheme .",

    "this casts doubt on the reliability of the commonly used perturbative expressions in this energy range . taking closer",
    "look at the conventional expansion we observed that one of the possible sources of the strong renormalization scheme dependence of perturbative predictions may be the strong scheme dependence of the conventionally used running qcd coupling parameter ( the couplant ) itself ; an extreme manifestation of the scheme dependence of the conventional couplant is the presence of a scheme dependent singularity ( landau singularity ) at nonzero value of @xmath102 ( section  3.1 ) .    as a step towards improving the reliability of perturbative predictions we proposed to replace the conventional couplant in the perturbative approximant of a given order by the modified couplant , obtained by integrating the renormalization group equation with a modified , nonpolynomial @xmath0-function that in each order is a generalization of the polynomial expression for the @xmath0-function used in the conventional expansion .",

    "one of the properties of our model is that in each order of perturbation expansion the modified couplant is free from the landau singularity , despite the fact that the @xmath0-function does not contain any essentially nonperturbative terms .",
    "we then performed a detailed analysis of the modified nl and nnl order predictions for @xmath135 and @xmath327 in various renormalization schemes .",
    "in particular , we generalized to the case of the modified perturbation expansion the equations defining the renormalization scheme distinguished by the principle of minimal sensitivity ( section  4.2 ) .",
    "the sequence of modified @xmath0-functions in our approach contains two parameters : parameter @xmath258 , related to the asymptotic behaviour of the modified couplant in the limit @xmath409 , and the parameter @xmath245 , which characterizes the value of the modified couplant , for which the nonpolynomial character of the modified @xmath0-function becomes important .",
    "the presence of these parameters gives us the opportunity to improve the accuracy of low order perturbative approximants by using use some information from outside of the perturbation theory .",
    "we proposed to fix the parameter @xmath258 in such a way that the modified couplant in every order has a @xmath410 behaviour in the limit @xmath409 , and to adjust the parameter @xmath245 so that the modified nnl order pms predictions for @xmath135 would match certain phenomenological expression for this effective charge ( section  4.3 ) . we have then shown that for the chosen values of the these parameters the modified perturbative predictions for @xmath135 and @xmath327 are much less sensitive to the choice of the renormalization scheme than the predictions obtained in the conventional expansion ( section  4.4 ) .",
    "the observed pattern of the scheme dependence of the modified expansion indicates in particular that the pms predictions in this expansion stand on a better footing than in the conventional expansion .",

    "it seems however that the results are sufficiently encouraging to justify a comprehensive study of various perturbative qcd predictions at moderate energies within the modified perturbation expansion approach .",
    "such study could include the perturbative qcd effects in the physics of heavy quarkonia , in hadronic decays of the @xmath132 leptons and in the deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering at the lower end of the energy scale",
    ". it would be then interesting to compare the results of such comprehensive analysis with the high energy measurements of the strong coupling parameter @xmath413 .",
    "as a first step towards such an analysis one should perform a more detailed study of possible methods to constrain the parameters @xmath245 and @xmath258 in the proposed sequence of the modified @xmath0-functions , generalizing the very simple approach adopted in this report .",
    "another interesting line of research would be to study the resummation of the qcd perturbation expansion in the modified approach  the stability of the modified couplant with respect to change of the renormalization scheme should have favorable effect on the stability and the rate of convergence of the results obtained with various summation methods . in this context",
    "it would be interesting to investigate , whether the pms prescription applied to the modified expansion does indeed act as an automatic resummation procedure for divergent perturbation series .",
