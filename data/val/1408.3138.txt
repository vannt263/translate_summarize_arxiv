    "with the exception of mergers and interactions between galaxies , star formation is the most transformative process that a galaxy can undergo .",
    "star formation in large gas - rich spiral galaxies is a very complex process that depends on many internal and environmental factors .",
    "alternatively , gas - rich dwarf irregular galaxies ( dis ) provide a much simpler laboratory for studying star formation processes in galaxies .",
    "in particular , blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds ) are especially unique objects , as they are currently experiencing some of the most intense bursts of star formation in the local universe .",
    "the term `` blue compact dwarf '' is used in the literature to describe a wide variety of galaxies .",
    "bcds were first identified by sargent & searle ( 1970 ) as small galaxies with emission lines in their spectra , giving the appearance of `` extragalactic hii regions '' .",
    "it is clear that bcds are relatively rare galaxies undergoing a significant starburst and that they have characteristically low metallicities .",
    "however , conclusions about the origin and nature of bcds depend strongly on sample selection .",
    "indeed , there are many different definitions of bcds in the literature ( e.g. , thuan & martin 1981 , gil de paz et  al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "soon after their discovery , the very blue colors of bcds were found to be consistent with bursting late type dwarfs ( searle , sargent , & bagnuolo 1973 ) .",
    "the combination of these blue colors with their very low metallicities led some to propose that bcds were young galaxies possibly undergoing their first episode of star formation ( searle & sargent 1972 ) . indeed , even modern observations ( e.g. , i zw 18 , izotov & thuan 2004 ) have concluded that some bcds are intrinsically young ( i.e. , @xmath1 myr old ) objects .",
    "however , whenever more sensitive observations are made ( e.g. , aloisi et  al .",
    "2007 ) , evolved stars are detected and it is clear that all of the known bcds have an underlying old stellar population .",
    "indeed , the discovery of an underlying lower surface brightness component ( loose & thuan 1986 ) in bcds was another confirmation that old stars are an important component in bcds , meaning that they are not young objects or purely hii regions . while suggestions have been made that there may be a small fraction of intrinsically young galaxies ( thuan et  al .",
    "1999 ) , the most recent searches have revealed older , underlying stellar hosts in all bcds ( papaderos et  al .",
    "2008 ) . since its discovery",
    ", the lower surface brightness component in bcds has been studied in the search for evolutionary connections between dwarf galaxies .",
    "lin & faber ( 1983 ) suggested that dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsph ) could form when a di loses its gas from ram pressure stripping near a large galaxy .",
    "however , thuan ( 1985 ) found that the infrared colors of dwarf elliptical galaxies ( des ) and dis imply metallicities that are quite different ; simple gas stripping is not enough to transform a di into a de . adding to these differences , papaderos et  al .",
    "1996 found that the underlying host structure of bcds was substantially different from dis and des , which means that the older stellar component must undergo serious structural changes if there are evolutionary connections between types of dwarf galaxies .",
    "this structural distinction in the underlying stellar component of dis and bcds has also been noted by marlowe et  al .",

    "in particular , luminous blue compact galaxies ( lbcgs , werk et  al .",
    "2004 , garland et  al .",
    "2004 , salzer et  al .",
    "2009 ) have been fitted with a variety of profile shapes ( micheve et  al .",
    "2013 , amorn et  al .",
    "2009 ) , as have the so - called green pea galaxies ( cardamone et  al .  2009 ) .",
    "in general , the lbcgs and bcds are both dominated in their appearance by recent and intense star formation , and the lbcgs may be higher - mass analogues to bcds . if the transformative effects of star formation can have a substantial impact in the more massive lbcgs , the effects of recent star formation in bcds will be even more significant .    to understand the evolutionary status of galaxies currently hosting bcd - like starbursts , we have acquired observations of a sample of bcds with high resolution and in many wavelengths . in this paper",
    "we compare the isophotal structures of bcds with other types of dwarf galaxies to shed light on possible evolutionary connections . in a subsequent paper",
    "we fit the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of these bcds with models to derive star formation histories and further constrain evolutionary pathways .",
    "many of the bcds in our sample have been observed with space- and ground - based telescopes .",
    "indeed , the literature is rich with high quality surface brightness profiles , some with even better resolution and depth than the observations presented here .",
    "however , most studies of the structural parameters of bcds are carried out in great detail but on only a handful of objects .",
    "the structural parameters obtained from fitting surface brightness profiles can be affected by the methods used or even the observations themselves . in order to avoid systematic uncertainties inherent in a heterogeneous sample",
    ", we will use only our own observations to determine structural parameters for our sample of bcds .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sampleobs ] we present our bcd sample and the observations we have obtained .",
    "our surface photometry methods and fits are described in section [ sbfits ] and the results of those fits are compared with other dwarf galaxies in section [ results ] .",
    "finally , we discuss the implications of these results and summarize our conclusions in section [ discussion ] .",
    "our sample of 21 bcds represents a variety of bcds and bcd - like galaxies , some of which are archetypal bcds ( e.g. , i zw 18 ) and some of which may be similar to des but possess a strong central starburst ( e.g. , mk 900 ) .",
    "the sample includes a wide range of bcd morphologies , including bcds with offset starbursts ( e.g. , mk 36 , mk 750 ) , bcds with two primary starburst regions ( um 461 , mk 600 ) , bcds with cometary shapes in their outer isophotes ( e.g. , mk 5 ) , and bcds with a large number of active star formation sites ( e.g. , um 439 , um 462 , um 323 ) .",
    "our bcds are all less luminous than @xmath8 ( typically around @xmath9 ) , have blue colors with @xmath10-@xmath11-@xmath12 , and are less than @xmath13 mpc distant ( their median distance is @xmath14 mpc ) .",
    "gas phase abundances ( @xmath15 ) show that our sample is characteristically metal poor , with a range between @xmath16 ( i zw 18 ) and @xmath17 ( mk 328 ) , although the vast majority have metallicity between @xmath18 and @xmath19 ; the median value is @xmath20 .",
    "table [ sample ] gives the details of our bcd sample .",
    "coordinates on the sky , observed recession velocities , and flow - model distances all come from ned ( nasa extragalactic database ) .",
    "our absolute magnitudes come from aperture photometry of the galaxies , using photometric zeropoints from stars in the field measured by sdss and 2mass ( see section [ bsdss ] and section [ h2mass ] ) , and are corrected for galactic extinction . also shown are the total integration times from our broadband optical , near - infrared , and narrow band observations .",
    "we varied the integration times on each target depending on their expected brightness and sky conditions .",
    "mk 750 was not observed in near - infrared .      in order to measure the structural parameters of the underlying host galaxies of our bcds , we need very deep images that are sensitive to their faint outer reaches .",
    "many of the bcds in our sample have been studied before , but previous surface photometry lacked the necessary depth and sensitivity to measure the structure of the host galaxies .",
    "we find that our understanding of the evolutionary context of bcds requires detailed knowledge about the structure of their faint underlying host galaxies .",
    "if bcds are typical dwarf galaxies undergoing a recent and localized burst of star formation , their underlying old stellar population should be similar to normal dwarf galaxies .",
    "it is easier to separate this old population from the recently - formed stars by considering only the underlying host galaxies of the bcds .",
    "we restrict our surface brightness profile fits to this underlying host light in the outskirts of the bcds .",
    "while the high surface brightness regions of the bcds typically have clumpy and irregular morphologies , the outskirts have more regular shapes and smoother light distributions .",
    "it is this underlying host galaxy that we fit in order to probe the bcd as it was before the current burst of star formation .",
    "given the very blue optical colors of our bcds , we chose to observe them in the johnson b filter in order to achieve the greatest sensitivity to the faint stellar populations of the underlying host galaxy . while this is the optimal filter choice for a metal - poor population , some of the blue light in the bcds also comes from their substantial ongoing star formation",
    "this recent star formation can be identified by bright h@xmath21 emission from the ionized gas around young massive stars .",
    "we observe each bcd in a narrow - band h@xmath21 filter to locate regions with active star formation .",
    "we use these h@xmath21 images to mask out regions of the b image involved in current star formation and keep only light from the underlying host galaxy .    a more direct way to study the underlying host galaxy light is to use a much redder filter which is mainly sensitive to the light from evolved stars and which is much less affected by recently formed stars . toward this end , we use the near - infrared ( nir ) h filter at @xmath22 to directly observe the old stellar populations of the host galaxies .",
    "very young ( @xmath23 myr ) stellar populations can have b - h @xmath24 , but old ( @xmath25 gyr ) stellar populations have b - h @xmath26 ( bressan et  al .",

    "carter et  al .",
    "although the bcds are much fainter and harder to observe in h than in b , the nir light is more representative of the old underlying component .",
    "we observed our sample of bcds using the wisconsin yale indiana noao ( wiyn ) 3.5 m telescope at kitt peak national observatory , between november 2008 and april 2010 .",
    "the minimosaic and optic ( orthogonal parallel transfer imaging camera ) imagers were used to obtain deep images in broadband b and narrow - band h@xmath21 filters , and whirc ( wiyn high resolution infrared camera , meixner et  al .",
    "2010 ) was used to obtain deep near - infrared images in the h filter .",
    "the good native seeing of the wiyn site provides images with an average of @xmath27 seeing .",
    "the following subsections describe the individual observations and processing .",
    "the b images of the bcds were observed with the minimosaic and optic imagers .",
    "minimosaic and optic both consist of two side - by - side 2048 x 4096 pixel ccds , where the pixels are 0.141@xmath28 on a side , and the field - of - view is 10@xmath29 .",
    "targets were placed on the cosmetically cleanest area of both cameras while avoiding the small chip gaps .",
    "two 900s ( or three 600s ) exposures were taken in b to aid in cosmic ray rejection .",
    "one galaxy ( mk 5 ) was observed twice as long to compensate for poor sky transparency during the observations .",
    "these images were reduced with the standard iraf ccdproc and mscred packages , including an overscan subtraction , bias image correction , and sensitivity correction from dome flat fields .",
    "laplacian cosmic ray rejection was applied to individual images with lacos ( van dokkum 2001 ) , a world coordinate system ( wcs ) was applied using the usno - b1 catalog , and mscimage was used to create single - extension images from the multi - extension images .",
    "finally , the individual images of each bcd were combined to create a single , deep image by averaging and using standard bad pixel masks .",
    "many of the b observations were not taken under photometric conditions , so we use a boot - strap calibration from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 9 ( ahn et  al .",
    "all but one of the bcds ( mk 5 ) are within the survey footprint . using broadband observations from another observing run with minimosaic during photometric conditions where standard stars were observed ( haurberg et  al .  in preparation ) , we derived our own empirical conversions between sdss ugriz photometry and minimosaic bvr photometry , and found the following relationship for b as a function of g and r :    @xmath30 .",
    "we measure the brightnesses of foreground stars on the same chip and amplifier as the bcds in our @xmath10 images and find a zero - point for each image based on the difference between the sdss catalog photometry and our measured photometry .",
    "we selected unsaturated stars with @xmath31 mag , and with photometric measurements better than @xmath32 mag . typical uncertainties ( standard deviations of multiple stars in each image ) on these computed zero - points",
    "are @xmath33 mag .",
    "we use these boot - strap calibrations for all @xmath10 photometry throughout this work for consistency .",
    "the final calibrated @xmath10 images are shown in the left - most column of figure [ images ] .",
    "we also find a small systematic offset between this aperture photometry and earlier @xmath10 photometry ( salzer , private communication ) , such that the new observations are @xmath34 magnitudes brighter , with a standard deviation of only @xmath35 magnitudes .",
    "this systematic difference could be related to the increased depth of our new observations which may have detected previously unseen low surface brightness light in the outskirts of the bcds .",
    "the narrow - band h@xmath21 images of the bcds were obtained with minimosaic , placing the targets on the cosmetically optimal portion of the detector , as with the b images .",
    "we used two narrow - band h@xmath21 filters appropriate to the redshift of the targets ( @xmath36 widths : @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) .",
    "as with the b images , in order to effectively reject cosmic rays , two 720s narrow - band exposures were taken of each target . a short ( 180s )",
    "image in the r filter ( encompassing the narrow - band filters in wavelength range ) was taken between the pairs of narrow - band exposures to provide an image for subtraction of the stellar continuum .",
    "the same image reduction methods were applied as with the b images .",
    "we remove the continuum from our h@xmath21 images by re - scaling the short @xmath39 filter exposure , following a well - documented procedure ( van sistine et  al .  in preparation ) .",
    "we first align the three images to match each other and apply a wcs using 2mass stars in the field .",
    "next we measure the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the profile of many stars in the three images to identify any mismatches in image quality through the sequence . in order to have effective continuum - subtraction , the images must be at approximately the same resolution .",
    "if the average fwhm differs between images by more than 0.2@xmath28 , the image with the smaller fwhm is smoothed with a gaussian kernel to match the larger fwhm .",
    "finally , stellar photometry is carried out in all three images , and the images are multiplicatively scaled so that stars , which we assume have no significant h@xmath21 emission on average , have the same flux in all images . to produce the final continuum - subtracted image , the scaled r image is subtracted from the average of the two h@xmath21 images .",
    "due to non - photometric conditions , standard stars were not observed during our h@xmath21 observations .",
    "however , we again use the calibrated photometric narrow - band minimosaic observations from haurberg et  al .",
    "( in prep ) to calculate a typical offset between photometry of stars in the r and h@xmath21 images .",
    "we find that the two filters have a consistent zero - point offset of @xmath40 magnitudes .",
    "finally , we compare the photometry of well - measured stars from the images to derive a relationship between calibrated sdss magnitudes and minimosaic r and find the following relationship :    @xmath41    we adopt the assumption that the narrow - band images here have no significant color term .",
    "thus , we use this relation to derive zero - points for our r images , and the standard offset between r and h@xmath21 zeropoints to calibrate our h@xmath21 images .",
    "these h@xmath21 images are reprojected using iraf s mscimage task to be matched precisely on the same pixel scale as the b images .",
    "the final calibrated h@xmath21 images are shown in the right - most column of figure [ images ] .",
    "the h images of the bcds were observed between nov 2008 and sep 2009 with the whirc imager .",
    "whirc has a @xmath42x@xmath42 hgcdte array with @xmath43 pixels and a @xmath44x@xmath44 field - of - view .",
    "total exposure times were between 2200s and 4600s per object .",
    "the most important step in reducing ground - based nir observations is the sky subtraction .",
    "atmospheric oh emission contributes heavily to the bright ( @xmath45 mag / arcsec@xmath7 ) near - infrared sky . with this high sky background in mind , we used dithered sequences of 3-minute exposures on each target .",
    "since the bcds are much smaller than whirc s field - of - view , most of the image is sky and a good sky subtraction can be obtained without separate dedicated sky observations .",
    "we dithered in a 2x2 box 50@xmath28 on a side , and offset subsequent dither boxes by 10@xmath28 .",
    "most targets had 12 three - minute exposures ( 3 separate 2x2 dithers ) , but we spent more time ( up to 26 three - minute exposures ) on the fainter targets .    these images were reduced with standard iraf routines , but required some special attention and efforts , described in detail in appendix a. in brief , the whirc task wprep is run to trim and linearize all of the raw images .",
    "dome flat fields were created by subtracting an average of 10 lamps - off flat fields from an average of 10 lamps - on flat fields , to remove the very high background ( alam & predina 1999 ) .",
    "these dome flats were also used to create a bad pixel mask . later on in the reduction process we created sky flat fields that flattened the observations significantly better than the dome flats .",
    "finally , we took darks at every exposure time we planned to use , since the dark level on whirc is not negligible .    to achieve a successful sky subtraction we used an iterative subtraction method with object masking . on each iteration , we use the combined images to mask out objects from the individual dithered frames , generate an improved sky subtraction , and then create better combined images .",
    "we also found it necessary to characterize and remove a dark `` palm - print '' feature from some images , which resulted from an issue with the amplifier electronics .",
    "the complete details of the sky subtraction and image processing are detailed in appendix a.    after the final images are created we measured the brightnesses of all of the 2mass stars in our frames to determine a photometric zero - point for each image .",
    "the final calibrated images are re - projected using mscimage to match the pixels in the b images ( 0.14  ) for consistent surface photometry .",
    "the final calibrated @xmath46 images are shown in the left - center column of figure [ images ] , using 2x2 pixel binning ( 0.28  pixels ) to increase the signal - to - noise ratio in each pixel .",
    "we also download calibrated @xmath47 images from sdss dr9 ( ahn et  al .",
    "2012 ) for the bcds in our sample ( excluding mk 5 , which has not been observed by sdss ) .",
    "these images have average fwhm of 1.3@xmath28 but are not as deep as our observations . using iraf s mscimage task and the compatible wcs on the sdss images and our own , we re - project each sdss filter image to match the pixels in our @xmath10 image . while less deep than our observations , we use these @xmath47 images to construct surface brightness profiles in additional colors across the high surface brightness regions of the bcds .",
    "this variety of colors is useful to compare with our deep @xmath48 color profiles . in particular",
    ", we convert the @xmath49 surface color profile into a @xmath50 profile .      in order to more directly probe the intrinsic stellar mass of the bcds",

    "wise surveyed the sky in 4 photometric bands between 3.4@xmath51 m ( @xmath52 band ) and 22 @xmath51 m ( @xmath53 band ) .",
    "the recent allwise data release ( http://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allwise/ ) contains the most reliable photometric catalog of sources released to date .",
    "in particular , we have obtained catalog aperture photometry for all of our bcds by finding the nearest wise source within 5@xmath28 of our bcds .",
    "these infrared luminosities are easily converted into stellar masses via the reliable mass - to - light ratio of mcgaugh & schombert ( 2013 ) , and will be even less affected by the recent star formation than the near - infrared observations .",
    "our observations in @xmath10 , @xmath46 , and h@xmath21 for each bcd are shown in figure [ images ] .",
    "most images are shown using a logarithmic intensity scaling to adequately show the high dynamic range between both the high and low surface brightness portions of each galaxy .",
    "the @xmath10 and @xmath46 images are shown in units of calibrated surface brightness ( magnitudes per square arcsecond , mag / arcsec@xmath7 ) and visibly demonstrate the range of morphologies of bcds in our sample . for most of our sample , we also produce @xmath48 color maps , which are shown in the third column of figure [ images ] . for mk 750 we do not have an @xmath46 image and thus can not create a @xmath48 color map .",
    "we also do not show a @xmath48 color map for um 461 because our @xmath46 image of um 461 is not sensitive enough .",
    "while the @xmath10 and @xmath46 images look generally similar to each other , the @xmath48 color maps show that there are significant color differences within the bcds . in particular , many bcds ( c.f .",
    "um 439 ) have regions of significantly bluer ( @xmath48 ) color which also correspond to regions of stronger h@xmath21 emission , likely indicating the locations of hii regions with hot young stars ionizing the low - metallicity gas that surrounds them . across most of the sample",
    "there is a ( @xmath48 ) color trend for the galaxies to have somewhat bluer centers and somewhat redder outskirts , which likely indicates the different stellar populations present across the galaxies .     while many of our bcds have already been observed by other researchers and have published surface brightness profiles , we restrict our analysis to those profiles which we have observed and processed with our simple and consistent method .",
    "one of the largest sample of modern high quality observations is micheva et  al .",

    "our objective is to measure the properties and structure of the @xmath10 and @xmath46 light of the underlying host in each of our bcds .",

    "we use our calibrated h@xmath21 images to identify and mask areas of active star formation in our b images .",
    "the b - filter light comes mostly from stellar emission , particularly from young , recently - formed stars . in order to compare bcd hosts with other types of dwarf galaxies , independent of recent star formation we use the h@xmath21 threshold masks to ensure that we only fit the light from the old stars and that our surface brightness profile fit represents the light from the underlying host galaxy .",
    "we use the galphot package and ellipse ( jedrzejewski 1987 ) task in iraf to fit elliptical isophotes to the @xmath10 images . starting from an initial isophote , the fit proceeds toward the center of the galaxy until it runs out of pixels to fit , and then proceeds toward the outskirts of the galaxy . at each isophote",
    ", the algorithm varies the geometric parameters ( center , ellipticity , position angle ) of subsequent ellipses until it best fits the galaxy at that isophotal level . below a certain signal - to - noise threshold ,",
    "there is not enough galaxy light to accurately determine the shape of the isophotes , so the parameters from the last well - determined ellipse are held fixed and all larger ellipses have the same ellipticity and position angle .",
    "the @xmath10 images are fit both with and without the h@xmath21 masks , and we find that the mask has a negligible effect outside of the bright , central region of the galaxy . as our profile fitting will be limited to the outskirts of the galaxies , these h@xmath21 masks will not drive our results but are a good precaution . however , to display sensible @xmath10 surface brightness profiles inside the regions excluded by the h@xmath21 masks , we need to make a composite profile . when fitting inwardly on the unmasked image , we hold the shape parameters fixed within the region covered by the mask . in detail , we determine the innermost isophote with at least half of its pixels unmasked , and use that as the transition point between an unconstrained shape fit , and holding the shape fixed all the way to the center .",
    "the resulting isophotal ellipse fits obtained from the b - filter surface photometry are then applied to the @xmath46 images to generate a comparable surface brightness profile in @xmath46 .",
    "we found very small differences in the @xmath46 surface brightness profile when it was determined using the @xmath10 annuli compared to when the @xmath46 profile was determined from an unconstrained fit to the @xmath46 image itself .",
    "however , due to the shallower nature of the @xmath46 images , the @xmath10 annuli are able to trace the @xmath46 profiles to fainter levels than if the @xmath46 images had been fit with independent isophotes .",
    "these same @xmath10 annuli are also used on each of the sdss @xmath47 images to determine surface brightness profiles in each filter .",
    "the use of spatially - matched images and common isophotes for all wavelengths allows us to create surface brightness profiles where each isophotal annulus measures the same physical part of the galaxy in each filter , enabling us to also create _ surface color _ profiles .",
    "we also apply a correction in each filter for galactic extinction obtained through ned , from the recently re - calibrated dust maps of schlafly & finkbeiner ( 2011 ) .",
    "dwarf galaxy surface brightness profiles can be fit with a wide variety of functions across their radial extent .",
    "a wide variety of surface brightness profile breaks are observed in dwarf galaxies ( herrmann et  al .",
    "2013 ) , but each component is still fitted with exponential profiles ( hunter & elmegreen 2006 ) , consistent with stellar disks .",
    "as motivated in section [ observations ] , in order to probe the structure of the underlying old stellar populations in the outskirts of the bcds , we fit only the outer portion of each bcd s surface brightness profile , where the shape is well described by a single exponential profile .",
    "this exponential decline likely indicates the presence of a somewhat regular underlying stellar disk .",
    "the inner limit of the fit to the underlying host galaxy is set at the point where the contamination by light from recent or ongoing star formation is no longer significant and the profile has a simple exponential decline .",
    "the outer limit of the fit is set by the signal - to - noise of the profile above the sky background , in terms of how bright the galaxy is relative to the standard deviation ( @xmath59 ) of the measured sky level .",
    "sometimes these fit limits are different between the @xmath10 and @xmath46 filter , owing usually to the shallower nature of the @xmath46 images . in a few cases the @xmath46 images are not deep enough to reach a region where the @xmath46 surface brightness profile follows an exponential decline , and no @xmath46 profile fitting is possible .",
    "for this reason , we do not fit @xmath46 profiles to was 5 , mk 36 , or um 461 ( c.f .",

    "2011 , and micheva et  al .",

    "2005 . while the @xmath60 and @xmath61 images are less deep than our observations , the additional color information is valuable even if it is only available in the higher surface brightness regions of the bcds . the @xmath50 and @xmath48 colors typically flatten to a constant value in the region of the outskirts where we fit exponentials to the profiles , and we compute the average color within this region as well .",
    "our linear least - squares fit to the surface brightness profiles of the underlying host galaxy gives a best - fit value of the slope ( related to the disk scale length ) and intercept ( related to the central surface brightness ) , but these observed quantities must be converted to intrinsic quantities .",
    "first we need to geometrically correct the observed central surface brightness @xmath51 to the central surface brightness for a face - on orientation @xmath62 using a determination of the inclination angle , @xmath63 , assuming an optically thin disk , with :    @xmath64 .    following the method of staveley - smith et  al .",

    "we determine the mean ellipticity ( @xmath69 ) within the outskirts of the galaxy where the underlying surface brightness profile is fit .",
    "we use this ellipticity to determine an estimate of the inclination angle , and correct all central surface brightnesses to face - on .",
    "we also use distances derived from flow models ( mould et  al .",
    "2000 ) to convert the scale radius into physical units .",
    "all of these best - fit parameters are listed in table [ structparms ] , and are plotted in the figures that follow ( absolute magnitudes are corrected for galactic extinction ) .",
    "the surface brightness profiles , ellipticity profiles , color profiles , and fits are all shown in figure [ sb ] .",
    "for each surface brightness profile we show the @xmath46 and @xmath10 profiles on the same scale and also plot the masked and unmasked @xmath10 profile fits together to show the minimal differences . because of the mask",
    ", the masked profile does not continue to the center of the galaxy .",
    "instead , we show a profile of fixed - shape isophotes which takes the shape of the inner - most well - determined isophote using the mask , and extending that shape inward .",
    "using a fixed - shape ellipse in the inner regions of the bcds has largely a cosmetic effect on the surface brightness profile , preventing the ellipse shape from varying wildly as it tries to match the irregular structures in the inner regions of most of the bcds .",
    "the fixed - shape profile is not necessarily physically meaningful , but it is representative of the azimuthally - averaged light distribution in the complex central regions of the bcds .",
    "we also show the ellipticity profile at the top of each graph in figure [ sb ] . as our profiles",
    "are all displayed in terms of semi - major axis , the ellipticity profile is necessary in order to interpret changes and shapes in the surface brightness profile .",
    "a few galaxies show dramatic changes in ellipticity in their fits .",
    "notably , mk 600 has @xmath70 across most of its profile , but in the inner regions , the ellipticity rapidly decreases as the isophotes become much more circular .",
    "that sudden change in @xmath71 causes a break in the surface brightness profile , which is evident in the graph as well . in general",
    "it is safer and simpler to use the semi - major axis for surface brightness profiles , but in cases where the ellipticity ( or position angle ) change rapidly , the resulting profiles are more difficult to interpret . in our bcds ,",
    "the underlying host profiles are all fit in regions of relatively stable ellipticity , so that our fits are unaffected by the irregular central regions where isophotal shapes may change more rapidly .",
    "the complex inner regions of the bcds have less bearing on this work than do the outskirts , as we are most interested in the underlying host light .",
    "there are some notable shapes and features in the profiles interior to the portions we fit .",
    "some bcds have significant curvature in their inner profiles ( was 5 , mk 475 , mk 900 , mk 324 , mk 328 ) , which looks similar to a devaucouleurs profile , suggesting that these galaxies may have bulge - like centers or be similar to des .",
    "other bcds have irregular bumps and jumps in their inner profiles ( mk 5 , i zw 18 , mk 36 , mk 750 ) , which show the difficulty of fitting smooth ellipses to inherently more complex structures .",
    "in particular , the central regions of um 461 and um 462 have a bright and nearly uniform level of intensity , punctuated with sites of active star formation , which makes for a very complex environment . finally , some bcds have profiles which remain almost exponential over their entire extent ( um 323 , um 408 , cg 10 , um 439 ) , which may indicate a somewhat simpler recent history of star formation and activity .",
    "the shapes of a few galaxies were particularly difficult to fit with our simple method , due to their significant irregularities .",
    "the cometary shape of mk 5 creates a significant positional offset between the center of the bright star - forming region and the center of the faint outer isophotes .",
    "this rapid shifting of successive isophotes leads to a poorly determined fit in the central regions , and so we do not display the inner part of the fit .",
    "the fit to the smooth , regular outer isophotes is reliable , though , so we keep this galaxy in our sample ( see also section 6.1.1 in amorn et  al .",
    "2007 for a 2d treatment of mk 5 ) . in a similar way",
    ", i zw 18 presents a challenging structure to be fit .",
    "because of the visible and irregular structures present throughout much of the galaxy , we caution that even though our fit is restricted to the outermost regions of the galaxy , we may not have reached the true underlying population of this faint , unusual galaxy .",
    "the graphs of @xmath48 and @xmath50 color in figure [ sb ] are also powerful tools in understanding these complex galaxies .",
    "the shallower depth of the sdss images makes the @xmath50 profile become noisy and erratic beyond the exponential fit region . inside the fit region and in the inner regions of the bcds , however , the @xmath50 and @xmath48 profiles are mostly well behaved and have interesting features .",
    "as noted in the @xmath48 color maps in figure [ images ] , the bcds tend to have bluer centers and redder outskirts .",
    "some bcds have particularly strong color gradients over most of their radial extent ( cg 10 , i zw 18 , was 5 , mk 750 , um 461 , mk 67 , mk 475 ) while others are surprisingly flat ( um 323 , um 408 , mk 600 , um 439 , mk 324 ) . the surface colors ( @xmath50 and @xmath48 ) , averaged within the region of the profile where we fit an exponential , are given in table [ structparms ] , and are fairly red .",

    "in fact , the trends may even be stronger when measured this way . in the relationship between @xmath214 and luminosity ,",

    "the change from @xmath218 to @xmath52 does not significantly change the position of the bcd hosts relative to the dis .",
    "the bcd hosts already had significantly higher central surface brightnesses than the dis , and no luminosity shift can alter that .",
    "overall , since the infrared luminosity makes the bcd hosts even more distinct , we can be sure that the unusual structural parameters of the bcds are not just a result of their current bursts of star formation .",

    "the error bars on the final point show the standard deviation of all isophotes within the region where the exponential profile is fit .",
    "we do not plot the central surface color since the @xmath10 , @xmath46 , and sdss images often have incompatible spatial resolutions .",
    "also shown are evolutionary tracks from simple stellar population ( ssp ) models ( bressan et  al .",

    "2010 , obtained at : ` http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/cmd ` ) .",
    "the bressan et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) models do not include contributions from thermally - pulsating asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) stars , while the girardi et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) models do include tp - agb stars .",
    "models are generated at metallicities that match the gas - phase abundances of the bcds and are shown in the appropriate panels .",
    "these @xmath50 vs @xmath48 evolutionary tracks do not include any non - stellar effects in the light output of the bcds , such as dust absorption , hot dust emission , nebular emission lines , nebular continuum , etc .",
    "while dust can have significant effects on galaxy colors , the low metallicities of these systems suggest that they will not have very much dust .",
    "most of our bcds have strong emission lines ( notably h@xmath21 , but also [ oiii ] 5007 and others ) , which may affect the broadband colors particularly in their inner regions .",
    "emission - line contamination should be negligible in the underlying host colors as measured in the outermost isophotes .",
    "we take these ssp model tracks as representative of stellar evolution in these systems , but do not expect exact agreement with our observations .",
    "the bcds show colors indicative of younger stellar populations near their centers , and colors consistent with older populations in their outskirts .",
    "this old population in the outskirts has been identified earlier , but is confirmed more robustly with this comparison to actual ssp models , even though these simple models do not include non - stellar emission or absorption .",
    "the paths that individual bcds take in color - color space all show radial age gradients in the sense that the average age of the stellar population increases with increasing radius throughout the bcd .",
    "this radial increase in average stellar age is seen all the way to the outskirts of the bcds , which gives some constraints on the formation and evolution of these galaxies .",
    "this universal age gradient might suggest that new stars are formed in the ( often irregular ) inner regions of bcds , and gradually diffuse into the outskirts over time .",
    "alternatively , this age gradient could mean that @xmath243 years ago ( the typical age of the outskirts ) , star formation took place across the entire bcd , and gradually became more confined to the central regions like it is today , perhaps as gas outflows quenched the ongoing star formation .",
    "it is also possible that most of the evolved stars were formed in an early star formation event and the younger average ages near the center are a result of recurrent starburst events producing young stars .",
    "still , even at @xmath12 @xmath244 , the color - color diagram indicates relatively old average ages for the bcds : the youngest , mk 475 , is around @xmath245 yr , but most are around @xmath246 yr .",
    "this underlying population age is in stark contrast with the ages of the most recent star formation , and it is important to note that there appears to be a significant presence of evolved stars even near the actively star - forming regions of these bcds .",
    "the central regions of all the bcds have significant h@xmath21 emission , which means o and b stars must be present to ionize the neutral hydrogen gas .",
    "those o and b stars only live 30 myr or less , so the central star formation is indeed very recent .",
    "however , it is an open question whether or not the current burst of star formation will create enough new young stars to significantly lower the average age of the outer regions of the bcds .      in order to quantify the significance of the current star formation event",
    ", we calculate the burst strength parameter for our bcds .",
    "burst strength is usually parametrized in terms of luminosity , and is the ratio between the light coming from the recently formed stars and the overall total luminosity of the galaxy . in the simplest scenario ,",
    "the underlying host galaxy light is well - described by an exponential profile , while the starburst is simply an addition of light near the center .",
    "it is more complex to determine the burst strength in real galaxies .",
    "salzer & norton ( 1999 ) observed a similar sample of bcds and dis , and derived surface brightness profiles for both galaxy types . in the same manner as this study , they fit the underlying host galaxy light with exponential profiles , and integrated those fits to derive total luminosities of the underlying host .",
    "however , as many groups have noted ( e.g. mccall et  al .",
    "2012 ) , the surface brightness profiles of dis tend to flatten near their centers , so the extrapolation of the exponential profile tends to overestimate the observed central surface brightness . in typical non - starbursting dis , the integrated luminosity of the exponential fit to the host is on average @xmath247 mag brighter than the total observed luminosity of the galaxy ( salzer & norton 1999 ) . to meaningfully determine burst strength in our sample of bcds",
    ", we must remove this average offset to correct the burst strength to its true value .",
    "in fact , we find that in many cases , an extrapolation the exponential fits of the underlying hosts of the bcds would predict a brighter central surface brightness than the observed value .",
    "just as we parametrize both the dis and bcd hosts with a single exponential function , we assume both will follow the same functional form .",
    "even though the bcd hosts typically have shorter exponential scale lengths than dis of similar luminosity , we expect them both to similarly flatten in their centers . in this way",
    ", our determination of the corrected burst strength of the bcds will represent the excess luminosity contributed by the starburst , without being affected by the centrally - flattening surface brightness profile of the underlying host .    following this method",
    ", we integrate the exponential profile fits to the underlying hosts of our bcds and apply the correction factor of @xmath248 mag to account for the central flattening of the underlying , older population of stars .",
    "we find that the average corrected burst strength of our sample of bcds is @xmath249 mag , with a range of corrected burst strengths from @xmath250 mag to @xmath251 mag across the sample .",
    "this means that the star formation in our bcds is responsible for average luminosity enhancements of @xmath249 mag or about a factor of @xmath252 in luminosity .",
    "papaderos et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) also determined the burst strength of their bcds , and found results similar to ours .",
    "their profile decomposition scheme was substantially more complicated , involving three - component fits to the surface brightness profiles .",
    "even with this difference in methodology , they found that the components associated with the starburst contributed an average of @xmath253 mag on top of the underlying host galaxy .",
    "our determination of burst strength is less dependent on assumptions about the profiles of bcds , since we compare host light to the total observed luminosity of the galaxy , rather than inter - comparing components of the same profile .    in the context of our earlier plots of structural parameters , we stress that this burst strength is too small to account for the displacement of the bcd hosts from the dis . while the bcd hosts are offset from the dis in terms of their exponential scale length when measured in the luminosity direction ( figure [ opt ] ) , this offset is @xmath224 mag .",
    "even if the @xmath218 values of the bcds were corrected to remove the light from the starburst and represent only the light from the underlying host galaxy , the bcd hosts would still be distinct from the dis .",
    "similarly , in terms of central surface brightness , no shift in the luminosity of the bcd hosts can bring them into agreement with the dis .",
    "in order to understand the evolutionary processes that affect dwarf galaxies , we have carefully measured the structural parameters of the underlying host galaxies in our sample of bcds and compared them with the structural parameters of a large number of dis .",
    "we emphasize that the structural parameters we have measured are , to the best of our abilities , independent of the existence of the current starburst .",
    "the structures of the bcd host galaxies occupy an extreme part of parameter space defined by the structures of dis .",
    "this parameter space covers one and a half orders of magnitude in scale length , and @xmath254 magnitudes ( more than a factor of @xmath255 ) in central surface brightness .",
    "this broad parameter space is bounded at one extreme by low surface brightness dwarf galaxies ( exceptionally faint @xmath215 and large @xmath214 for their luminosities ) , and at the other extreme by bcd hosts ( exceptionally bright @xmath215 and small @xmath214 for their luminosities ) .",
    "the bcd hosts are similarly distinctive in the near - infrared structural parameter diagrams .",
    "the distinctive compactness of the underlying bcd hosts is similar to the results of van zee et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) who found that the neutral hydrogen gas ( hi ) in bcds is also more centrally concentrated than other gas - rich dwarf galaxies .",
    "van zee et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) also found that the rotation curves in bcds were steeper than in comparable dwarf galaxies , indicating a more compact mass distribution , as well .",
    "more recently , lelli et  al .",
    "( 2014 ) studied the hi in a sample of dwarf galaxies and found that bcds have stronger velocity gradients in their inner regions than non - starbursting dwarf galaxies .",
    "lelli et  al .",
    "( 2014 ) and van zee et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) both discuss the persistent nature of this compact structure , even after the current burst of star formation has faded .",
    "the unusually compact nature of the stars and gas in these galaxies likely points to a difference in the underlying dark matter distribution of bcds .",
    "certainly the compact distribution of luminous matter seems to be a hallmark of bcds ; the dark matter distributions are likely to be similarly compact .",
    "it may be that this compact matter distribution is the reason bcds can host such intense starbursts . while bcds were first identified for their intense star formation activity",
    ", the strong starbursts may merely be symptoms of a compact matter distribution . in this way ,",
    "the compact mass distribution is the fundamental parameter of bcds , not their intense but transient star formation events .",
    "this structural distinction of the bcd hosts is important both in terms of identifying a well - defined and meaningful sample of present - day bcds , and also in understanding the past and future evolution of present - day bcds .",
    "there are many possible definitions of bcds that use various observational criteria ranging from spectral diagnostics to isophotal colors ( sargent & searle 1970 , thuan & martin 1981 , gil de paz & madore 2005 ) .",
    "we suggest that the truly distinctive observable characteristic of bcds compared with dis is their exceptionally concentrated underlying mass distribution , as measured by the compact light distribution .",
    "this is not a new definition or suggestion , as compactness was part of the original discovery and classification of bcds by sargent & searle ( 1970 ) .",
    "thuan & martin ( 1981 ) loosely parametrized this compactness by requiring bcds to have optical sizes @xmath256 kpc . shortly thereafter , this classification got even broader with the atlas of virgo cluster dwarf galaxies ( sandage & binggeli 1984 ) , where starbursting dwarf galaxies with `` several knots and some low surface brightness fuzz '' were cataloged as bcds although the authors acknowledged that `` our bcd objects would not fall into the extremes of this class '' .",
    "the bcd classification continued to grow increasingly broad with time .",
    "loose & thuan ( 1986 ) describe bcds as `` low - luminosity galaxies ... undergoing intense bursts of star formation '' , as do more recent groups like lelli et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) `` ... low - mass galaxies that are experiencing a starburst '' . the frequently - cited definition in gil de paz et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) parametrizes compactness via the peak surface brightness , and requires @xmath25722 mag / arcsec@xmath7 , rather than actually measuring the compactness of the underlying light .",
    "gil de paz et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) , like many authors , determine these criteria based on their sample of `` known '' bcds .",
    "many other authors follow this definition and substitute small size for compactness , and some even classify bcds purely spectroscopically .",
    "as the definition of a bcd has evolved , the importance of compactness has been increasingly overlooked .",
    "our conclusions from this study suggest that the compactness of the underlying light is a defining characteristic of bcds , and is just as important to their classification as their blue color and their low luminosity .    even after the current starburst fades ( if @xmath218 fades by perhaps as much as @xmath258 magnitude ) , the bcd hosts will continue to occupy this extreme area of parameter space .",
    "fading of @xmath218 can bring bcd hosts closer to the distribution of normal dis in terms of scale length , but a change in @xmath218 does not bring the bcd hosts closer to the dis in terms of central surface brightness . _",
    "major structural changes would be required in the underlying light distribution if bcds could transform to or from dis .",
    "_ this type of transformation would require mechanisms that could cause galaxy - wide structural changes in dwarf galaxies , in particular , changes to the structure of the underlying mass distribution . among the most frequent mechanisms discussed for transforming the underlying structure of non - interacting dwarf galaxies are substantial mass loss from galactic winds ( mac low & ferrara 1999 ) and infall of fresh gas . in denser environments , interactions with other galaxies",
    "can also have transformative effects ( e.g. , ram pressure and tidal stripping of dwarf spheroids in cluster environments ) .",
    "ongoing secular structural evolution within the bcds is not expected to change the underlying structure dramatically enough , as the time scales for internal evolution processes are longer than the other mechanisms discussed .",
    "furthermore , the energy required to remove enough material from the central regions to cause global structural changes is prohibitively large .",
    "whether this underlying structural distinction is significant enough to truly distinguish bcds from dis is a more complicated question which requires additional detailed studies across all types of dwarf galaxies .",
    "the broad continuum of structural properties of dwarf galaxies ( as seen in the broad parameter space populated by galaxies in both panels of figure [ opt ] ) further complicates the classification process , and muddles the evolutionary pathways .",
    "one class of dwarf galaxy which may be relevant to these evolutionary connections is the `` transition '' type dwarf galaxy ( ttd ) .",
    "ttds have been studied by many groups ( dellenbusch et  al .",
    "2008 , koleva et  al .",
    "2013 , and references therein ) , and share properties with both the gas - rich classes of dwarf galaxies ( di and bcd ) and the gas - poor classes ( de and dsph ) .",
    "it has been suggested that ttds may possibly represent a short - lived transition period between classes . in some cases",
    ", ttds may be classified as bcds ( e.g. , a galaxy with de - like outer regions but a starburst at its center ) or vice versa .",
    "while star formation events can alter the appearance of dwarf galaxies , our results suggest that transitions between `` true '' bcds and typical dis would require a significant amount of structural change to the underlying hosts .",
    "we consider such transitions unlikely",
    ".    given the apparent permanence of the underlying compact global structure of bcd hosts , and the short gas depletion time scales of the current star formation in bcds , there must be galaxies which have had a bcd - like phase in their past but which are not forming stars as actively today .",
    "indeed the galaxies we have identified in table [ similar ] with similar structural parameters to the bcd hosts may be examples of galaxies which , if starbursting , would be classified as bcds .",
    "other groups have searched for bcds before or after their burst phase .",
    "snchez almeida et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) has identified a population of dwarf galaxies in sdss which may be bcds during quiescence ( qbcds ) .",
    "qbcds have some properties in common with bcds ( i.e. , similar structure and color of the outskirts ) but are not necessarily undergoing a significant burst of star formation . while the sample of 21,000 qbcds used by snchez almeida et  al",
    ".  may include some examples of bcd - like galaxies in quiescence , they note that the gas - phase abundances of the qbcds are @xmath259 dex more metal rich than bcds on average , which makes them an unlikely population to transform simply into bcds with the addition of a starburst",
    ". however , the less likely scenario of pristine gas infall might be able to lower their metallicities and trigger a starburst to bring them out of quiescence .",
    "next we consider the impact of the duty cycle of star formation in bcds , as today s bcds can not sustain their starbursts indefinitely .",
    "lee et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) used a volume - limited survey of 261 nearby galaxies ( within 11 mpc ) to determine that only @xmath260% of dwarf galaxies are currently experiencing global star formation events .",

    "( 2009 ) volume ( mk 36 & mk 475 ) , and are among the three largest h@xmath21 equivalent width systems in their entire sample . even if bcds have a significantly greater duty cycle of star formation than normal dwarf galaxies , there should be many more non - bursting bcds than bursting bcds at any given time .",
    "depending on what triggers the bursts in the bcds , the pre - burst and post - burst bcds may have observable signatures , as well .",
    "for example , a post - burst bcd would have a unique stellar population for a while as its starburst population becomes intermediate aged .",
    "these starburst events themselves may also last longer than is commonly assumed .",
    "mcquinn et  al .",
    "2010 studied twenty dwarf galaxies and found that most of the starburst durations were between 450 - 650 myrs , considerably longer than the lifetimes of o and b stars .",
    "still , we expect the underlying host galaxy structure to change on a slower time scale than that of the starburst , so we could look for galaxies with similarly compact underlying old stellar populations but without current significant star formation ( e.g. , the types of galaxies listed in table [ similar ] ) . in principle , surveying for non - bursting dwarf galaxies with compact structural parameters would allow for the determination of the bcd duty cycle . however , carrying out such a study in practice would be very difficult , as it would require detailed observations of a large volume - limited sample .",
    "in addition to classifications of dwarf galaxies based on the structural parameters of their underlying host galaxies , we briefly consider what can be inferred about their evolutionary status by studying their stellar populations .",
    "the detailed sed - modeling of the stellar populations and star formation histories of this sample of bcds will be explored in a subsequent paper , but for now we consider the color gradients found in the bcds and shown in figure [ bvbh ] .",
    "we find agreement with other groups that the outer regions of bcds indeed show colors consistent with evolved stellar populations , but it is revealing to also see how the stellar population changes radially across the galaxy .",
    "marlowe et  al .",
    "1999 produced similar plots ( their fig .",
    "7 ) which showed that the cores of `` blue amorphous galaxies '' typically have colors consistent with ages of @xmath261 years while the outer regions of their underlying host galaxies have colors consistent with ages of @xmath262 years . comparing an individual galaxy s age range ( or , analogously , color gradient ) from its center to its outskirts may give insight not only about its particular star formation history ( sfh ) but also about its preferred modes of star formation .",

    "2003 ) to check and improve the wcs on all of the images .",
    "once the wcs was suitable , we used mscimage to re - project all of the images for a particular target and filter onto the same pixel scale so that they were aligned .",
    "we applied this same re - projection to the original bpms as well , and used them on the final images .",
    "these reprojected sky - subtracted images are then median - combined ( using the sky level from the central region as the zero - level in imcombine ) to create our first stacked images of each target .",
    "the added depth of these images allows us to detect and mask objects too faint to be seen in individual frames , to further improve the sky subtraction .",
    "we used the acesegment task to automatically detect and generate a mask for all of the objects in the combined image .",
    "these masks are then reprojected using mscimage back to each of the original images from that dither sequence .",
    "using these detailed masks we generated improved dark sky flats for each filter .    finally , we begin the final - pass sky subtraction using these detailed masks on every raw image . this final sky subtraction is more sophisticated than the previous sky subtractions since we create a custom sky image for each individual science image . in most cases we created the sky image from a masked weighted median combination of the ( usually ) 7",
    "nearest ( most contemporaneous ? ) images of the same dither sequence .",
    "a combination of the detailed object masks and the bad pixel mask were used on each of the raw images , and the images with the `` palm - print '' are excluded from the sky image creation .",
    "we used the second - pass sky subtraction to assess sky stability and determine whether 5 , 7 , or 9 images should be used in the median combine .",
    "we also weighted each image in the median combination by @xmath282 where @xmath283 is the number of images separating the target image from the sky image in the dither sequence .",
    "this weighting method increases the contribution from nearby images and decreases the contribution from more distant images . after subtracting the sky image from each science frame",
    ", we flatten the images with the improved dark sky flats created using the detailed masks .",
    "now we must remove the dark `` palm - print '' feature from the affected first - images .",
    "the sky subtraction on these images is satisfactory , since only the adjacent non - affected images were used to create the sky images .",
    "we median combine all sky - subtracted images in a particular filter that contain the dark feature in order to make a template model of the feature .",
    "this template is scaled to precisely match each affected image , by matching median levels in selected regions both on and off the feature .",
    "after the template has been scaled to the individual image , the template is subtracted from the image , and the dark `` palm - print '' feature is removed .    before the final stacking of dither sequences",
    ", we also checked the photometric stability throughout the night by measuring the brightnesses of 2mass stars in each individual frame .",
    "we used this photometry to check for absolute zeropoint variations throughout the night and also be sure that the photometry was stable throughout individual dither sequences . if standard stars are being observed to calibrate the observations , this photometric verification is useful . when we did experience non - photometric conditions , the 2mass stars in the final stacked image were used to determine a post - calibration zeropoint .",
    "just before doing the final image stacking , we checked that all of the images have excellent wcs and re - projected them to be mutually aligned .",
    "additionally , we calculate the original sky level of each image ( before any sky subtraction was applied ) and store it as a header keyword in order to later restore the poisson image statistics .",
    "we use imcombine to average and ccdclip the images , using both the median of the central 1000x1000 pixels as the zeropoint ( which was usually very close to zero ) and the offsets from the wcs . after this image",
    "is combined , we add a constant value to it in order to make the final sky level the same as the average throughout the sequence .    at this point , the images have been fully reduced and are ready to be measured .",
    "the combination of the iterative sky subtraction and object masking ( and the dark `` palm - print '' feature removal ) makes these reduced images suitable for surface photometry .",
    "an extensive detailed description of the parameters used for each task is available upon request , but it was too detailed to present in this appendix .",
    "in addition to the per - image calibrations from 2mass , we calibrated many of our observations using jhk standard stars from hunt et  al .",
    "presented in the table below is a sample of our derived zero - points and color terms , and the values we used for airmass extinction .",
    "these values come from observations of 7 standard stars in jhk filters on the night of november 5th 2008 .",
    "the full set of photometric equations for calibrated @xmath267 magnitudes , and @xmath276 and @xmath278 colors are given below .",
    "descriptions and values of the adopted and best - fit terms are given in table [ jhk ] ."
