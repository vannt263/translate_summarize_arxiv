    "the goal of the nucleus - nucleus collision research program at the present and the future gsi accelerators is to investigate the properties of highly compressed nuclear matter .",
    "such a form of matter exists in various so far unexplored phases in the interior of neutron stars and in the core of type ii supernova explosions .",
    "figure [ nstar ] illustrates structures of neutron stars as predicted by various models ( compilation by f. weber @xcite ) . as to date , none of these proposed novel phases of subatomic matter can be ruled out by observation .",
    "further understanding of the structure on neutron stars requires more experimental information on the nuclear equation - of - state at high baryon densities , on the in - medium properties of hadrons , in particular of strange particles , and on location of the deconfinement phase transition at high baryon densities .",
    "[ hpt ]       the nuclear matter equation of state plays an important role for the dynamics of core collapse supernova and for the stability of neutron stars . in type",
    "ii supernova explosions , symmetric nuclear matter is compressed to 2 - 3 times saturation density . these conditions are realized in heavy - ion collisions at sis18 beam energies , although the temperatures reached in nuclear collisions are higher than those in the core of a supernova .",
    "the isospin asymmetric matter in the interior of neutron stars is compressed to 5 - 10 times saturation density . at these high densities ,",
    "the nucleons are expected to melt into quarks and gluons .",
    "the experimental study of this extreme state of matter in the laboratory will be one of the major research programs at the future facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) .",
    "figure [ eos ] depicts different versions of the equation of state as predicted by different calculations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the figure illustrates that it is not sufficient to determine the nuclear compressibility ( which is determined by the curvature of e(@xmath0 ) at saturation density ) , but rather one has to study the response of nuclear matter at different densities , which means one has to perform nucleus - nucleus collisions at different beam energies .",
    "[ hpt ]        the study of the equation - of - state ( eos ) of symmetric nuclear matter is one of the most challenging goals of the nuclear collision experiments at gsi .",
    "the experimental observables related to the eos are the collective flow of nucleons and the production of strange particles .",
    "microscopic transport calculations indicate that the yield of kaons created in collisions between heavy nuclei at subthreshold beam energies ( e@xmath1 = 1.58 gev for nn@xmath2@xmath3n ) is sensitive to the eos of nuclear matter at high baryon densities @xcite .",
    "this sensitivity is due to the production mechanism of k@xmath4 mesons . at subthreshold",
    "beam energies , the production of kaons requires multiple nucleon - nucleon collisions or secondary collisions such as @xmath5n@xmath2@xmath3 .",
    "these processes are expected to occur predominantly at high baryon densities , and the densities reached in the fireball depend on the nuclear equation - of - state @xcite . according to transport calculations , in central au+au collisions",
    "the bulk of k@xmath4 mesons is produced at nuclear matter densities larger than twice saturation density .",
    "moreover , @xmath6 mesons are well suited to probe the properties of the dense nuclear medium because of their long mean free path .",
    "the propagation of @xmath6 mesons in nuclear matter is characterized by the absence of absorption ( as they contain an antistrange quark ) and hence kaons emerge as messengers from the dense phase of the collision .",
    "in contrast , the pions created in the high density phase of the collision are likely to be reabsorbed and most of them will leave the reaction zone in the late phase .",
    "the influence of the medium on the @xmath6 yield is amplified by the steep excitation function of kaon production near threshold energies .",
    "early transport calculations find that the @xmath6 yield from au+au collisions at subthreshold energies will be enhanced by a factor of about 2 if a soft rather than a hard equation - of - state is assumed @xcite .",
    "recent calculations take into account the modification of the kaon properties in the dense nuclear medium @xcite(see next chapter ) . when assuming a repulsive @xmath6n potential as proposed by various theoretical models ( see @xcite and references therein ) the energy needed to create a @xmath6 meson in the nuclear medium is increased and hence the @xmath6 yield will be reduced .",
    "therefore , the yield of @xmath6 mesons produced in heavy ion collisions is affected by both the nuclear compressibility and the in - medium kaon potential .",

    "the kaos collaboration proposed to disentangle these two competing effects by studying @xmath6 production in a very light ( @xmath8c+@xmath8c ) and a heavy collision system ( @xmath9au+@xmath9au ) at different beam energies near threshold @xcite . the reaction volume is more than 15 times larger in au+au than in c+c collisions and hence the average baryonic density - achieved by the pile - up of nucleons - is significantly higher @xcite .",
    "moreover , the maximum baryonic density reached in au+au collisions depends on the nuclear compressibility @xcite whereas in the small c+c system this dependence is very weak @xcite .",

    "recent qmd transport calculations which take into account a repulsive kaon - nucleon potential reproduce the energy dependence of the kaon ratio if a compression modulus of @xmath10 = 200 mev for nuclear matter is assumed @xcite .",
    "these calculations use momentum - dependent skyrme forces to determine the compressional energy per nucleon ( i.e. the energy stored in compression ) as function of nuclear density ( see figure [ eos ] ) .",
    "the result of this calculation is presented in figure [ eosexci ] in comparison with the data @xcite .    in order to reduce systematic uncertainties both in experiment ( normalization , efficiencies , acceptances etc . ) and theory ( elementary cross sections etc . )",

    "the total energy of a kaon at rest in nuclear matter increases and the antikaon energy decreases with increasing density .",
    "it has been speculated that an attractive @xmath13n potential will lead to bose condensation of @xmath13 mesons in the core of neutron stars above baryon densities of about 3 times saturation density @xcite .",

    "the accelerators will deliver primary beams ( protons up to 90 gev , uranium up to 35 agev , nuclei with z / a = 0.5 up to 45 agev ) and secondary beams ( rare isotopes and antiprotons ) with high intensity and quality .",
    "the aim of the nucleus - nucleus collision research program is to explore the qcd phase diagram at high net baryon densities and moderate temperatures .",

    "the phase diagram also contains the critical endpoint ( star ) which has been predicted recently by lattice qcd calculations @xcite .",

    "the lambda / pion ratio exhibits also a maximum at the same beam energy . in this case",
    ", the shape of the excitation function can be reproduced by a statistical model analysis , which indicates that the transition from baryon dominated matter to meson dominated matter occurs at a beam energy of about 30 agev .",
    "it turns out that the maximum net - baryon density at freeze - out is reached at a beam energy of 30 agev @xcite .",
    "the major challenge is to find diagnostic probes which are connected to the onset of chiral symmetry restoration , to the deconfinement phase transition , and to the equation of state of hadronic and partonic matter .",
    "the in - medium spectral functions of short - lived vector mesons - which are expected to be sensitive to chiral symmetry restoration - can be studied in the dense nuclear medium via their decay into lepton pairs @xcite .",
    "since the leptons are very little affected by the passage through the high - density matter , they provide , as a penetrating probe , almost undistorted information on the conditions in the interior of the collision zone . another observable sensitive to in - medium effects is open charm , e.g. d - mesons .",
    "the effective masses of d - mesons - a bound state of a heavy charm quark and a light quark - are expected to be modified in dense matter similarly to those of kaons .",
    "such a change would be reflected in the relative abundance of charmonium ( c@xmath28 ) and d - mesons .",
    "the onset of a first order phase transition is expected to cause a discontinuity in the excitation function of particular observables .",
    "such a non - monotonic behavior has been observed around 30 agev in the kaon - to - pion ratio and in the inverse slope parameter of kaons @xcite .",
    "a beam energy scan looking at a variety of observables is needed to clarify the experimental situation .",
    "this includes the measurement of the phase - space distributions of strange particles , in particular multi - strange baryons ( anti - baryons ) , and particles containing charm quarks .",
    "for example , a discontinuity in the excitation function of the j/@xmath29-to-@xmath29 ratio would indicate sequential charmonium dissociation due to color screening in the deconfined phase .",
    "moreover , event - by - event fluctuations are expected to appear when crossing a first order phase transition , and particularly in the vicinity of the critical endpoint .",
    "the identification of a critical point would provide direct evidence for the existence and the character of a deconfinement phase transition in strongly interacting matter .",
    "the formation of a mixed phase indicating the onset of deconfinement leads to a softening of the equation of state at a given beam energy @xcite .",
    "the location of the so called softest point ( i.e. where the sound velocity exhibits a minimum ) may be discovered by measuring carefully the excitation function of the collective flow of particles .",
    "charm production plays a particular role at fair energies , because charmonium , d - mesons and charmed hyperons are created at beam energies close to the kinematical threshold .",
    "therefore , these particles are sensitive probes of the early , high - density stage of the collision ( more than 10 times saturation density ! ) .",
    "collective effects contributing to charm production may be visible for the first time .",
    "charm exchange processes may become important , revealing basic properties of charm propagation in a dense baryonic medium .",
    "the situation is analogue to strangeness production at sis18 energies , where 2 - 3 times saturation density is probed in au+au collisions . in order to perform high statistics measurements ,",
    "the low cross sections for charm production at threshold beam energies has to be compensated by high beam intensities .",
    "the experimental task is to identify both hadrons and leptons and to detect rare probes in a heavy ion environment .",
    "the apparatus has to measure multiplicities and phase - space distributions of hyperons , light vector mesons , charmonium and open charm ( including the identification of protons , pions and kaons ) with a large acceptance .",
    "the challenge is to filter out those rare probes in au+au ( or u+u ) collisions at reaction rates of up to 10@xmath30 events per second .",
    "the charged particle multiplicity is about 1000 per central event .",
    "therefore , the experiment has to fulfill the following requirements : fast and radiation hard detectors , large acceptance , lepton and hadron identification , high - resolution secondary vertex determination and a high speed trigger and data acquisition system .",
    "the layout of the cbm experimental setup is sketched in figure  [ cbm ] .",
    "the cbm setup consists of a the following subsystems :    * a large acceptance superconducting dipole magnet * a radiation - hard silicon tracking station comprizing pixel / strip detectors * a silicon pixel microvertex detector with high position resolution and low material budget * a ring imaging cherenkov detector ( rich ) for soft electron identification * transition radiation detectors ( trd ) for identification of electrons with momenta above 2 gev / c * a muon detection system consisting of several layers of absorbers and tracking chambers .",
    "this system is an alternative to rich and trds , which then would be used as tracking stations for hadron identification .",
    "* resistive plate chambers ( rpc ) for time of flight measurement ( hadron identification ) * an electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) for identification of photons * a high speed online event selection and data acquisition system    the cbm detector is designed for a comprehensive research program using proton beams ( with energies of 10 - 90 gev ) and nuclear beams ( 10 - 45 agev ) impinging on various targets .",
    "the measurements at beam energies below 10 agev will be performed with the hades detector .",
    "the measurements , in particular those of rare diagnostic probes , require a dedicated accelerator with high beam intensities , large duty cycle , excellent beam quality , and with an operational availability of several month per year .",
    "details of the cbm research program and of the setup can be found in the technical status report which has been submitted in january 2005 @xcite .",
