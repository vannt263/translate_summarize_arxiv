    "the clustering of galaxies on small scales provides important constraints on the relationship between galaxies and the underlying dark matter distribution .",
    "this relation is of interest in itself as a constraint on galaxy formation and evolution , as well as for quantifying the impact of galaxy - formation scale physics on larger scale clustering measures used for cosmological parameter constraints .",
    "modern approaches to modeling the relationship between galaxies and the underlying dark matter distribution rely on the basic tenet that galaxy formation requires a gravitationally - bound dark matter halo or sub - halo to accumulate and condense gas @xcite . in their simplest form ,",
    "such `` halo models '' contain one dominant variable that determines the probability that a ( sub-)halo hosts a galaxy of interest . in the halo occupation distribution ( hod )",
    "formalism adopted in this paper , halo mass is the dominant variable and halos are permitted to host more than one galaxy . in the sub - halo abundance",
    "matching ( `` sham '' ) formalism , the maximum circular velocity at accretion is often used @xcite .",
    "the primary advantage of sham is that each sub - halo hosts only a single galaxy , thus requiring fewer free parameters to specify the model but assuming a specific but physically motivated relation between central and satellite galaxies .",
    "the practical disadvantage is that @xmath11-body simulations require higher resolution to resolve sub - halos . in principle",
    "both of these approaches could be generalized to include additional secondary variables such as halo formation time , with observable consequences @xcite .",
    "there are a host of observables available to constrain halo models as a function of galaxy properties : one - point statistics like number density or luminosity functions , two- or three - point galaxy clustering @xcite , marked statistics @xcite and direct measurements the galaxy group multiplicity function @xcite .",
    "the most widely used observable is the projected correlation function , @xmath12 , which removes sensitivity to redshift space distortions by integrating over the line - of - sight separation . while redshift space distortion effects are more difficult to model , they do provide complementary constraints both on the velocity distribution of galaxies relative to their host dark matter halos @xcite and on cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "the primary goal of the present paper is to use the information in the anisotropy of the galaxy correlation function on scales @xmath0 @xmath1 mpc to simultaneously constrain the hod and growth rate of cosmic structure through the pairwise infall of galaxies caused by their mutual gravitational attraction @xcite .",
    "constraints on gravitational infall on these scales is of particular interest in searching for signatures of modified gravity : for instance , an @xmath13 model with @xmath14 predicts a @xmath15 increase in the amplitude of pairwise infall velocities on scales of 10 - 30 mpc @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the non - linear regime is also a promising avenue for constraining dark sector coupling @xcite .",
    "we can also use the constraints on the hod to infer the nuisance parameter @xmath16 employed in our analysis on larger scales @xcite to account for the velocity dispersions of galaxies relative to their host dark matter halos . see @xcite for a similar concept applied to the power spectrum multipoles .",
    "in this paper we focus on the cmass sample from the sdss - iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) .",
    "this sample has thus far been the focus of several cosmological analyses , most recently providing a one per - cent absolute distance measurement using the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) standard ruler @xcite and a 6% constraint on the growth rate of cosmic structure @xcite",
    ". the projected correlation function of these galaxies has also been used to constrain halo models using both the hod @xcite and sham @xcite formalisms ; this work represents the first quantitative comparison to the small - scale anisotropic clustering of the cmass galaxies .",

    "[ sec : modgrav ] we discuss the implications of our results for constraining modified gravity models , and in sec .  [ sec : conc ] we discuss future prospects for this technique .",
    "many components of our analysis are interdependent , so a strictly linear presentation is impossible",
    ". therefore we provide an overview of the full analysis here .",
    "the first new product of this work is an unbiased estimate of the small - scale aniostropic clustering of the cmass sample from the boss survey .",
    "second , we implement a new algorithm to quickly and accurately predict two - point clustering statistics as a function of hod parameters .",
    "the algorithm is based directly on measuring the clustering of halo catalogs derived from @xmath11-body simulations ; it uses no analytic approximations or fits for the one - halo or two - halo terms .",
    "we combine these two products to constrain both hod and growth rate parameters .    for the measurements ,",
    "the primary source of systematic uncertainty , referred to as `` fiber collisions '' , is the instrumental constraint that spectroscopic fibers can not be placed closer than 62  during a single observation .",
    "therefore , the galaxies that do not receive a spectroscopic fiber are a non - random subset of the targets ; they preferentially reside in regions of higher target density .",
    "moreover , the positioning of spectroscopic tiles depends on the angular density of targets , so that regions in which plates overlap ( and therefore fiber collisions can be resolved ) are not representative of the full survey .",
    "ignoring these effects would substantially bias our clustering measurements . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fb ] we consider two fiber collision correction methods previously introduced in the literature : nearest neighbor redshift assignment and angular upweighting .",
    "neither correction is exact , so we apply the boss tiling pipeline to a mock galaxy catalog to determine which fiber collision correction method is best on which scales , which potential observable is the least affected , and what the residual biases are . below we define the set of clustering measures we will consider for our final analysis .    we make use of halo catalogs derived from different @xmath11-body simulations for three distinct purposes :    * to evaluate theoretical models for parameter estimation * to estimate the uncertainty ( theory covariance matrix ) due to the finite volume of simulations used to compute the theoretical models * to generate the mock galaxy catalog to which we applied the boss tiling algorithm in order to study the effects of fiber collisions .",
    "below we specify the set of @xmath11-body simulations we use for these purposes as well as explain how the halo catalogs are derived from the simulation outputs .",
    "the primary goal of our analysis is to constrain the growth rate of cosmic structure using redshift space distortions , and so we review the basic physics first .      because cosmological flows are non - relativistic , the spectrosopically observed redshift of a galaxy can be expressed as the sum of two components : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the redshift expected if the universe were homogeneous , while the second term accounts for the component of the physical `` peculiar velocity '' along the line - of - sight ( los ) , i.e. , the proper motion of an object due to its local gravitational potential . here",
    "@xmath20 is the scale factor of the universe and c is the speed of light .",
    "`` redshift space distortions '' ( rsd ) is the generic term referring to distortions in the observed galaxy density field due to the @xmath21 contribution to the observed redshift coordinate . throughout this work",
    "we will quote velocities in units of distance , with the relation between peculiar velocity @xmath22 and apparent line - of - sight comoving distance shift @xmath23 for a galaxy observed at @xmath24 given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the expansion rate at @xmath24 .    on large scales where linear perturbation theory applies , the peculiar velocity field @xmath27",
    "is simply related to the underlying matter density fluctuations , @xmath28 : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the logarithmic growth rate , and @xmath31 is the linear growth function that specifies the amplitude of fluctuations as a function of @xmath24 , relative to some initial fluctuation amplitude : @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , in the linear regime , a measure of the amplitude of the peculiar velocity field through rsd provides a constraint on @xmath33 times the amplitude of matter fluctuations on some scale ; often this scale is taken to be 8 @xmath1 mpc , so that linear redshift space distortions measure @xmath17 .",
    "because the scale - dependence of the matter power spectrum is extremely well - constrained by the cmb , the specified scale is not important for many applications ( see section 5.1 of * ? ? ?",
    "the measurement of the amplitude of the peculiar velocity field is typically made using the variation of the amplitude of galaxy clustering as a function of orientation with respect to the line of sight caused by redshift space distortions .",
    "on large scales , eq .",
    "[ eq : pecv ] implies @xcite @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the observed ( in `` redshift space '' ) galaxy density fluctuation for wavevector @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the real space linear galaxy bias , and @xmath38 is the true underlying matter density fluctuation ( i.e. , in `` real space '' , without velocity perturbations included in the redshift direction coordinate ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath39 is the cosine of the angle between @xmath36 and the los , and the known @xmath39 dependence allows a measurement of @xmath17 after marginalizing over the unknown galaxy bias . in the present work ,",
    "we work strictly in configuration space ; see @xcite for the configuration space equivalent of eq .",
    "[ eq : kaiser ] .    on smaller scales investigated in the present work ,",
    "nonlinearities become important and the relationship between @xmath40 and @xmath28 becomes substantially more complicated .",
    "a detailed description of many distinct physical effects that impact the observed redshift space galaxy clustering on small scales is given in @xcite . because of the complexity of the modeling and the high statistical precision of our data , we resort to @xmath11-body simulations to provide predictions for our observables , which we describe below .      because rsd effects only distort the observed coordinates ( or pair separations ) in the los direction , the two - point correlation function @xmath42 is fundamentally a function of two variables .",
    "in fig .  [",
    "fig : xibutterfly ] we choose as coordinates the los separation , @xmath43 , and the separation transverse to the los , @xmath44 to display our measurement from the galaxy sample analysed in the present work .",

    "two primary features are apparent : on large scales ( @xmath45 @xmath1 mpc and above ) , contours of constant @xmath42 are `` squashed '' in the los direction . the correlation between the density and velocity field described by eq .",
    "[ eq : pecv ] on average reduces the apparent separation between pairs of galaxies along the line of sight . on smaller scales where eq .",
    "[ eq : pecv ] breaks down , the contours are instead stretched along the los .",
    "galaxies orbiting in the potential of a gravitationally bound dark matter halo have a virial - like velocity component .",

    "the prominent feature in @xmath42 along the los ( i.e. , at @xmath46 @xmath1 mpc ) is due to these motions , often called `` fingers - of - god '' ( fogs ) @xcite ; note that these virial - like velocities distort @xmath42 at all separations , and their impact must be mitigated even in analysis of relatively large scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "while we are unable to provide any quantitative constraints without halo catalogs derived from modified gravity simulations , the @xmath261 precision of our gr - based @xmath17 constraint should severely limit the types of modifications described above .",
    "we have made the most precise comparison to date between the observed anisotropic clustering of galaxies at relatively small separations ( @xmath0 @xmath1 mpc ) and the predictions of a standard halo model in the context of @xmath2cdm .",
    "we found good agreement between our simplified , redshift - independent hod model and our measurements of both the projected and anistropic clustering on small scales .",
    "our fits constrain the growth rate of cosmic structure at the effective redshift of our galaxy sample : @xmath262 .",
    "this constraint is consistent with but improves on our dr11 analysis of large scale anistropy @xcite by a factor of 2.5 .",
    "intriguingly , our result has the same statistical power but is @xmath8 low compared with planck s @xmath2cdm prediction , @xmath137 @xcite .    the competitive statistical precision of our measurement warrants a systematic evaluation of the observational and modeling systematics . for the former",
    ", we introduced a new anisotropic clustering statistic @xmath60 that does not include information below the fiber collision scale , but approaches the usual multipoles on large scales .",
    "we carefully assessed the systematic and observational uncertainties from the angular upweighting method to correct fiber collisions to order to estimate the projected correlation function @xmath47 .",
    "we combined these measurements to obtain robust joint constraints on the halo occupation distribution and growth rate of cosmic structure probed by cmass galaxies .    to assess the robustness of our modeling assumptions",
    ", we investigated several generalizations to our hod assumptions and particularly how we assign velocities to the mock galaxies from which we draw our theoretical predictions ; the results are summarized in table [ tab : hod ] .",
    "the variations we examined caused at most @xmath158 shifts in the @xmath17 constraints . however , given the statistical precison of our reported constraint , further investigation with more sophisicated modeling of the galaxy - halo connection is warranted .",
    "of the possibilities we explored , a model that relaxes the assumption that halos hosting satellite galaxies also host centrals ( labelled `` cen / sat test '' ) improved the fit to our measurements by @xmath263 but did not shift @xmath17 constraints appreciably .",
    "such a model is well - motivated by our target selection process ",
    "both color cuts and photometric errors cause massive galaxies to scatter in and out of the sample .",
    "alternatively , we can also improve the model fit by increasing the satellite galaxy velocity dispersion at fixed halo mass .    at least within the cosmological parameter space we explored",
    ", we found that for two different definitions of the central galaxy velocity , the data prefer @xmath88 , the motion of the densest @xmath264 clump , over @xmath75 , the halo center - of - mass velocity averaged over all particles within @xmath265 .",
    "a comparison of these two velocity fields also indicates a possible shift of @xmath266 in the effective large scale @xmath17 , and should therefore be considered when this level of precision is reached .",
    "while we have not tested any explicit modified gravity models , we have shown that the clustering of few @xmath267 @xmath1 mpc halos are consistent with the expectations of @xmath2cdm and a simple picture of galaxy formation in which halo mass is the only relevant variable determining the probability of hosting a cmass galaxy . to quantify the precision of this test",
    ", our best fit model matches the observed @xmath93 at the 3 per - cent level from 0.8 - 32 @xmath1 mpc , and 15 to 5 per - cent level from 5 to 32 @xmath1 mpc for @xmath74 , with reasonable agreement compared to our uncertainties on smaller scales as well .    as the example of @xmath13 shows ,",
    "modified gravity could potentially dramatically alter structure growth on these scales , and our analysis should be used to constrain such models .",
    "in addition to the @xmath17 constraint afforded by our measurements , more precise galaxy velocity bias predictions in @xmath2cdm would allow our joint constraints on @xmath163 and @xmath110 to be interpreted as an additional consistency test between the halo mass inferred from clustering amplitude @xmath110 , and from the halo virial velocities probed by @xmath163 .",
    "finally , even ignoring the information of the small - scale clustering on @xmath17 , our data tightly constrain the impact of the intra - halo motions of galaxies on clustering at relatively large scales .",
    "we derive a prior on the `` finger - of - god '' nuisance parameter that is tighter but consistent with the prior adopted in @xcite and @xcite",
    ". moreover , our detailed study of the clustering on small scales also allowed us to validate that @xmath16 as defined in those works can precisely describe the impact of intra - halo velocities of cmass galaxies on quasi - linear scales .",

    "throughout this analysis we have treated the cmass sample within @xmath268 as a single population .",
    "one reason for this is that fiber collision corrections using the angular upweighting become substantially more uncertain as the spectrosopic sample becomes a smaller subset of the target sample .",
    "however , the nearest neighbor correction method should be valid in arbitrary redshift bins .",
    "[ fig : zdep ] shows our measurement of @xmath60 using the nearest neighbor redshift correction for redshift cuts that split the sample equally into three bins in both the north and south .",
    "these bins also have different galaxy weighted number densities : @xmath269 3.4 , 3.4 , and 1.5 @xmath270 . rescaling the bootstrap covariance matrix derived for the full sample by @xmath271 to compute an approximate @xmath83 difference between the subsamples and the full @xmath268 sample , we find these subsample clustering measurements to be consistent with being drawn from the full sample ( @xmath272 ) , with the exception of the highest redshift bin in the north ( @xmath273 for 18 bins ) ; comparison with the same bin in the south suggests most of the difference could be cosmic variance rather than a systematic change from the clustering of the full sample . the covariance matrix used for this comparison is approximate and does not include any of our theoretical error budget . remarkably , our target selection algorithm selects galaxies with very similar clustering across the redshift range of our sample , even though the linear growth factor increases by 14% in our fiducial cosmology between @xmath62 and @xmath274 .",
    "using the medres simulation box , we explore in the left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : vcenapp ] the mean square velocity difference between the halo center of mass velocity and various central velocity definitions , in units of the halo velocity dispersion : the velocity of the particle at the potential minimum ( red ) , the velocity averaged over the innermost 10 and 20 particles ( green ) , the velocity averaged over a fixed fraction of the innermost halo members , ranging from 3.75% to 40% ( blue ) , and the fiducial choice adopted in this work ( thick black dashed line ) and detailed in sec .  [",
    "sec : nbody ] .",
    "the right panel demonstrates that the mean square dispersion of the central velocity depends on the fraction of innermost halo particles used to determine the central velocity ( blue curve ) . for uncorrelated intrahalo motions",
    ", we would expect the green curve ; we interpret the difference ( red curve ) as evidence for bulk motion of the central galaxy .",
    "this naive noise estimate suggests that our fiducial central velocity definition has a sizeable contribution from particle noise .",
    "we integrate the square velocity difference in the central velocity dispersion between our medres and hires simulations ( lower dashed and solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparevcatsvsm ] ) over the best fit hod , and find only a 13% excess in the medres simulation . since the hires mass resolution is eight times larger , we are therefore confident that our central galaxy velocities are negligibly affected by resolution in the mass range of interest for this analysis",
    ".    however , since their is no apparent convergence of the central velocity dispersion at small smoothing scales , we expect our predictions for galaxy clustering to be sensitive to this choice . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nbody ] we argued that our fiducial choice corresponds to the typical galaxy size for the population we are modeling , at least over the halo mass range that dominates the clustering signal .",
    "moreover , our fiducial choice provides approximately the correct amount of central velocity dispersion to match the observed @xmath60 ; slight modifications to the central velocity definition may improve the fit on small scales .",
    "we have not explored this possibility further here , but hope to in future work .",
    "we note that the final test in sec .",
    "[ sec : robustresults ] showed that our measurements do not favor additional random central velocity dispersion .",
    "examination of hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulations would shed light on both the impact of baryonic effects and could determine the best algorithm to estimate the central galaxy velocity from dark matter - only simulations .    finally , we note that a similar effect was discussed in @xcite ; their figure 11 includes the _ median _ three - dimensional velocity offset at @xmath275 in halo mass bins , but averaged in spherical shells rather than including all particles within a given radius .",
    "nonetheless , from their plots we would expect @xmath276 km @xmath277 for @xmath278 and @xmath255 @xmath279 halos , averaged over 0.06 ( 0.12 ) mpc , while our measurements shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparevcatsvsm ] predicts @xmath280110 ( 237 ) km @xmath277 for the rms three - dimensional rms velocity at this redshift .",
    "in addition , we find the one - dimensional velocity distribution of @xmath281 to be approximately exponential , for which we expect the rms to be larger than the median by a factor of @xmath282",
