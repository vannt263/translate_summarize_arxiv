    "multi - hadron systems , from the deuteron to heavy nuclei to neutron stars , represent a significant fraction of the universe that we observe , and for decades the phenomenological study of these systems defined the field of nuclear physics .",
    "understanding how nuclei and nuclear interactions emerge from quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the underlying theory of the strong interaction , is now a central goal of modern sub - atomic physics .",
    "since hadrons are bound - states of quarks and gluons , they do not arise at any finite order in perturbation theory and a description from qcd has proved elusive . the only known non - perturbative method that systematically implements qcd from first principles is its formulation on a discretized space - time , _",
    "lattice qcd_. while it is still not possible to directly calculate the properties of even the simplest nucleus from qcd , the tools and technology are gradually being put in place to make such calculations possible with lattice qcd in the near future .",
    "the impact of the successful realization of this goal can not be overstated .",
    "for the first time , it would allow reliable calculations of strongly - interacting many - body processes that are not ( or are only poorly ) accessible experimentally .",
    "important examples are hyperon - nucleon interactions that many play significant roles in the interior of neutron stars .",
    "further , it would enable the exploration of how the properties of such systems depend upon the fundamental constants of nature , exposing the ( possible ) fine - tunings between the light - quark masses that give rise to the multiple fine - tunings observed in nuclear physics .",
    "our current understanding of nuclei requires a small but non - zero three - nucleon interaction . in the study of the structure of nuclei ,",
    "we now have refined many - body techniques , such as green s function monte - carlo ( gfmc )  @xcite with which to calculate the ground states and excited states of light nuclei , with atomic number @xmath5 .",
    "using modern nucleon - nucleon potentials that reproduce all scattering data below inelastic thresholds with @xmath6 , such as @xmath7 @xcite , one fails , quite dramatically , to recover the structure of light nuclei .",
    "the inclusion of three - nucleon interactions greatly improves the predicted structure of nuclei , but at present , such interactions are difficult to constrain . at some point in the future , lattice qcd will be able to predict the interactions between multiple neutrons ( and proton and mixed proton - neutron systems ) , bound or unbound in the same way it will be used to determine the two - body scattering parameters .",
    "a calculation of the three - neutron interaction , for instance , will be possible .    as a first step toward the study of nuclei and their interactions using lattice qcd , in this work we study systems composed of up to twelve @xmath0 s .",
    "these multi - pion systems are conceptually and computationally the simplest multi - hadron systems that can be constructed .",
    "in addition to the two - body interactions , there are expected contributions from multi - body interactions .",
    "such multi - body interactions are not forbidden by the symmetries of qcd , and are expected to be present with a magnitude that can be estimated with naive dimensional analysis ( nda )  @xcite .",
    "however , they are qualitatively ( and obviously quantitatively ) different from systems involving nucleons .",
    "the lowest - lying continuum state of multiple pions in a large volume is perturbatively close to each pion carrying zero - momentum , whereas the wavefunctions of systems of multiple nucleons are subject to the pauli exclusion principle .    in a recent letter  @xcite , we have reported results of the first many - pion calculation unless otherwise stated . ] in lattice qcd .",
    "we explored systems containing up to five pions , extracted the @xmath3 scattering length , and , for the first time , found indications of a non - zero renormalization group invariant ( rgi ) @xmath4-interaction . here",
    "we continue our investigations , presenting more detailed results of the previous studies and extending our work to systems containing up to twelve charged pions .",
    "we also use the recently derived expression for the ground - state energy of @xmath8-identical bosons in a finite volume at @xmath9 @xcite in our analysis , one order beyond that at which our previous calculations  @xcite were analyzed .",
    "multi - pion systems are of interest in their own right as a strongly interacting boson gas at finite density and temperature",
    ". such systems may be important for the late - time evolution of heavy ion collisions , such as those at rhic and also in the interior of neutron stars  @xcite . during the last several years",
    "there have been a number of theoretical explorations of pionic systems at finite isospin chemical potential , with or without a finite baryon number chemical potential .",
    "leading order ( lo ) chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath10pt ) has been used to study the vacuum realignment that takes place in the presence of an isospin chemical potential that exceeds the mass of the pion , leading to a charged pion condensate , and excitations about this realigned vacuum .",
    "one of the important results of this present work is the calculation of the isospin chemical potential as a function of the isospin density .",
    "our results are in good agreement with the lo @xmath10pt result , and further , demonstrate the sizable contribution from multi - pion interactions even at moderate densities .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : multi - meson - energies ]",
    "we review the theoretical expectations for the ground state energy of multi - pion systems at finite volume and discuss methods for extracting their interactions . in section  [ sec : lattice - techniques ] we provide details of our lattice qcd measurements and analysis and in sections [ sec : correlation - energies ] and [ sec : threebody ] we present the main results of our calculations . in section [ sec : chemical ]",
    "we discuss the implications of our results for the equation of state of the pionic gas , its isospin chemical - potential and its pressure .",
    "finally in section [ sec : disc ] we discuss the results in a global context and conclude .",
    "certain technical details of contractions and numerical implementation are relegated to the appendices .",

    "the breakdown of double - precision calculations with increasing @xmath8 and @xmath112 , where non - zero values of the correlation functions are lost to noise , is clear .",

    "given a particular gauge field , the accuracy with which the quark propagator is computed ( e.g. the tolerance in conjugate gradient ( cg ) algorithm ) will influence the correlation functions computed from that propagator . in extreme cases , where the solution is quite inaccurate in comparison to the statistical precision of the importance sampling procedure , this residual error can persist through the ensemble averaging and lead to errors in the correlation functions . in the case of the multi - pion correlations studied here ,",
    "the situation is particularly acute as the high powers to which the propagators are taken can enhance small effects . at this point in time",
    "we have not performed a detailed study of this issue .",
    "it would require generating full sets of propagators at different inversion precisions on the same configurations .",
    "we have simply studied the effect on a few representative configurations , and it is clear that for large @xmath8 , significant differences in the correlation functions can arise from loose tolerance of the cg - solver . in future studies of even larger @xmath8 ( and very high precision studies of any observable ) , this issue must be investigated in more detail .",
