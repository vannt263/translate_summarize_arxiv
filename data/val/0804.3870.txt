    "the integral ( international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory ) satellite was launched on 17 october 2002 . since then",
    ", there were many observations of the gamma - ray and x - ray sources obtained .",
    "thanks to the omc ( optical monitoring camera ) , there was collected also a large database of the observations in the visual passband .    for a detailed description of the camera , its efficiency and parameters ,",
    "see e.g. @xcite . due to its relatively large field of view ( almost 5 @xmath1 5 degrees )",
    "there were observed also many photometric variable stars near the gamma and x - ray sources as a by - product .",
    "the main advantage of the omc data is the duration of the continuous time series of observations , which could reach up to a few days without any interruption .",
    "this could not be achieved by the ground - based telescopes . due to this fact",
    ", there could be discovered also very slow variables , or the minima of very slow algol - type eclipsing binaries ( hereafter ebs ) could be catched during one observation run .",
    "despite the fact that the older omc observations are available on the internet ] , the data mining and the analysis are still very rare .",
    "regarding the ebs , there were only one paper about the system v435 cas ( see @xcite ) and the collection of 236 minima timings of ebs by @xcite .",
    "the analyses of the light curves of eclipsing binaries have not been published so far .",
    "all observations of the selected systems were carried out by the same instrument ( 50 mm omc telescope ) and the same filter ( johnson s v filter ) .",
    "time span of the observations ranges from november 2002 to july 2006 .",
    "a transformation of the time scale has been done following the equation @xmath2 . only a few outliers from each data set were excluded .",
    "the phoebe programme ( see e.g. @xcite ) , based on the wilson - devinney algorithm @xcite , was used .    due to the missing information about the stars , and having only the light curves in one filter , many of the parameters have to be fixed . at first , the temperature of the secondary component was fixed ( according to the estimated spectral type ) . the `` detached binary '' mode was used for computing and the eccentricity was set to 0 ( circular orbit ) .",
    "the limb - darkening coefficients were interpolated from van  hamme s tables ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the values of gravity brightening and bolometric albedo coefficients were set at their suggested values for convective atmospheres ( see @xcite ) , i.e. @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "no third light was assumed : @xmath5 .",
    "the first system is pv  cyg (= an  93.1928 = gsc 03137 - 03117 , @xmath6  56@xmath7  29@xmath8 , @xmath9  43@xmath10  08@xmath11 , j2000.0 , @xmath12  mag ) .",
    "this star was discovered to be a variable by @xcite and its designation as pv  cyg was introduced by @xcite . since then",
    ", there was no detailed analysis of the system performed , only the times of minima observations were published .",
    "the only rough estimation of its spectral types as a1+[g6iv ] were published by @xcite , but it is not very reliable .",
    "light curve of pv  cyg.,width=521 ]    according to these spectral types , the temperature of the primary should be circa 9100  k and the temperature of the secondary about 5700  k ( according to @xcite ) . due to this fact",
    ", the temperature of the secondary was fixed @xmath13  k and @xmath14 was calculated ( from its starting value 9100  k ) . the final fit is plotted in fig.[figpvcyg ] , while all the relevant parameters of the fit are presented in table [ tablebig ] . in this table the ephemeris @xmath15 and @xmath16 are written together with the inclination @xmath17 , the mass ratio @xmath18 , the radii ratio @xmath19 , the temperature ratio @xmath20 , the luminosity ratio @xmath21 and the kopal s potentials @xmath22 , respectively .    altogether there were obtained 795 observations of the star .",
    "as one can see from table [ tablebig ] , the radius of the secondary is larger than the radius of the primary . despite this fact , thanks to the higher effective temperature of the primary",
    ", the relative luminosity of the primary component is about 4 times larger .",
    "the scatter of the individual measurements is quite high , but the final fit is satisfactory .      the eclipsing binary v822  cyg (= an  216.1935 , @xmath6  54@xmath7  08@xmath8 , @xmath23  21@xmath10  00@xmath11 , j2000.0 , @xmath24  mag ) was discovered by @xcite .",
    "the light curve was observed and published by @xcite , but any analysis has been performed , so its parameters are still questionable . @xcite",
    "published the first approximate estimation of the spectral types , resulting in ( a3)+[g2iv ] . but this result is again not very reliable .    from these spectral types one could derive the temperatures @xmath25  k and @xmath26  k ( according to @xcite ) .",
    "exactly the same method as in the previous case was used .",
    "altogether there are 1680 observations of v822  cyg .",
    "the resulting parameters are in table [ tablebig ] and the plot is in fig.[figv822cyg ] .",
    "light curve of v822  cyg.,width=521 ]    although the scatter of the measurements is rather high , thanks to the relatively large number of observations ( 1855 in total ) , the final fit is satisfactory and no other effects are observable in this light curve .",
    "the last eclipsing binary selected for a detailed analysis is v1011  cyg (= gsc  02677 - 01203 , @xmath6  55@xmath7  15@xmath8 , @xmath27  12@xmath10  30@xmath11 , j2000.0 , @xmath28  mag ) .",
    "it was discovered to be a variable by @xcite .",
    "the spectral type a0 was presented in @xcite , while more detailed classification as a0+[g3iv ] was presented in @xcite .    according to this latter paper ,",
    "the proposed temperature of the primary is circa 9400  k , and about 5800  k of the secondary .",
    "altogether there are 1704 observations .",
    "as one can see , the curve is not symmetric and the brightnesses near the phase -0.1 and near the phase 0.1 are not equal .",
    "this could be explained e.g. by the presence of a spot . if one assume the spot to be located on the primary component , the parameters of such a spot are the following :    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the final parameters of the light - curve fit are presented in table [ tablebig ] and the fit itself is plotted in fig.[figv1011cyg ] .",
    "the 3-d plot of the system is shown in fig.[fig3d ] .",
    "light curve of v1011  cyg.,width=529 ]    however , the presence of spot on the primary is not able to describe the light curve in detail and at least two spots are needed .",
    "one of them should be brighter and the other one dimmer than the surface of the star .",
    "there is a slight difference between the shapes of the light curves obtained at different epochs .",
    "the first observations from 2002 show larger difference in brightness near the phase -0.1 and 0.1 , while the observations from the following years show almost symmetric curve .",
    "this could indicate the time evolution of the spots .",
    "only further analysis would confirm the presence of the spots and their possible evolution .",
    "the light - curve analysis of three selected systems in cygnus constellation has been done . using the light curves observed by the integral satellite , one can estimate the basic physical parameters of these systems . despite this fact , the parameters are still only the preliminary ones , affected by relatively large errors and many of the relevant parameters",
    "were fixed at their suggested values . the detailed analysis is still needed , especially in different filters .",
    "together with a prospective radial - velocity study , the final picture of the systems could be done .",
    "particularly , the system v1011  cyg seems to be the most interesting one due to its asymmetric light curve .",
    "based on data from the omc archive at laeff , pre - processed by isdc .",
