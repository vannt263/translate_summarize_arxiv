    "this is in distinction from fluctuations generated by a finite number of scattering centers which are non - vanishing in the limit of a large number of colors but vanish in the limit of an infinite number of color sources  @xcite .",
    "four- and higher order - particle elliptical anisotropies also demonstrate a non - trivial behavior as a function of number of colors and number of sources  @xcite .",

    ", one sees odd harmonics , and they indeed develop after the collision of the nuclei has taken place while final state interactions are in play  @xcite .    it is the purpose of this paper to elaborate somewhat on the generation of flow in the classical equations that describe the evolution of the glasma  @xcite and to build a bridge between the analytical calculations in the dilute  dense limit ( see e.g.  ref .",

    "we then iterate the equations around the leading order , treating the color field of the nucleus to all orders , and we find that we generate odd moments of azimuthal anisotropy in the first such iteration of these equations .",
    "the non - zero contribution to odd harmonics arises from the interference of the leading and next - to - leading orders .",
    "we find remarkable simplification for the result for such odd moments when gluons are put on mass shell , and we integrate over intermediate coordinates associated with iterating the equations .",
    "this exercise is not only academic , in that it provides analytic confirmation of what is already known from numerical simulation , but it is also useful for describing dilute systems such provided by pp and pa collisions , since the analytical form may be somewhat simpler to use than numerical solutions to the full scattering problem .",

    "here we briefly summarize our results and provide some comments .    1 .",
    "the surface contribution on the light cone gives zero odd azimuthal anisotropy to all orders .",
    "it is t - even and can be written in a local form . 2 .",
    "the odd harmonics originate from evolution in the forward light cone .",
    "they are non - local and not t - even . in single particle inclusive process they average out to zero for a gaussian ensemble because they are proportional to @xmath13 .",
    "essentially they are defined by odderon exchanges .",
    "we were unable to establish the connection between our formulae and geometric anisotropy in the initial state @xmath128 . from the equation it is obvious that the anisotropy is not defined by the global scales , but rather by the geometry on the scales of @xmath129 .",
    "4 .   the argument presented in ref .",
    "@xcite is valid only for the surface contribution in the dilute approximation .",
    "we showed that the bulk contribution for configuration - by - configuration single inclusive result is not symmetric under @xmath130 .",
    "our results take into account the first saturation correction , which was also considered in  ref .",
    "we complement the numerical results of refs .",
    "@xcite with an analytical prove beyond any doubts in numerics and uncertainty in the prescription of what is defined by a gluon at an intermediate state , @xmath28 , that cym produces odd azimuthal anisotropy",
    "our results can be potentially used to calculate @xmath131 without solving cym numerically .",
    "we thank a.  bzdak for sharing his puzzle on the two - dimensional fourier transformation , odd harmonics , and necessity to include the time - dependence .",
