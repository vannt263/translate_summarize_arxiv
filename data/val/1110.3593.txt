    "while the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) states of a photon allow higher dimensional representations of quantum information @xcite , an entangled photonic state that is encoded in terms of oam states will suffer degradation of the encoded information when it propagates through a turbulent medium as a result of the decoherence of the entanglement that is caused by the scintillation . to design a quantum communication system",
    "one therefore needs to understand the decoherence process of spatial mode entanglement in a turbulent atmosphere .",
    "recently a theoretical framework , in the form of an infinitesimal propagation equation ( ipe ) , has been developed to handle this problem @xcite .",
    "although it extended previous work @xcite , which modeled the turbulence with a single phase function , the framework in @xcite considered only single photons going through a particular turbulent atmosphere at a time .",
    "the effect of multiple photons going through the same medium has therefore been neglected . here",
    "we extend the framework to include the additional correlations that are introduced when multiple photons propagate through the same medium . as a result",
    "we obtain additional terms in the final expression for the ipe .",
    "these terms serve to link different photons with each other .    at the same time we also provide a more thorough discussion of the quantization of the electric field .",
    "previously @xcite , the quantization of the electric field was expressed in the popular way @xcite .",
    "however , it can be shown that the quantum states that are defined in this way are manifestly not lorentz covariant @xcite ( under a lorentz boost the orthogonality relation for these quantum states transforms into an expression that is different from the original expression ) .",
    "on the other hand , one can argue that the final expression would inevitable be non - covariant as a result of the explicit violation of lorentz covariant when one either fixes the propagation direction or enforces the field to be monochromatic .",
    "the question then is whether the final expression could be derived consistently from an initial lorentz covariant formulation . in other words , does the final expression look the same when one starts with the usual non - covariant quantization as it would when one starts from a lorentz covariant quantization and then goes , in a consistent manner , through the steps that explicitly breaks the lorentz covariance ?",
    "we find that there is a minor difference between these expressions ( the integrals in the latter case contain an additional factor of @xmath0 ) , but in the paraxial limit this difference becomes insignificant .",
    "in general , quantum basis states are defined in the fourier domain where they represent a plane wave basis and depend on the three components of the propagation vector @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 and on the angular frequency @xmath4 . due to the vacuum dispersion relation @xmath5 , any three of the four quantities @xmath4 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 will fix the fourth .",
    "therefore , the phase space integrals for propagating ( on shell ) fields only run over three of these quantities .",
    "it is natural to select @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 as the three integration variables , which then fixes the value of @xmath4 .",
    "in this way one can define all the quantities in an explicitly lorentz covariant manner .",
    "we ll start with the expressions in this form .    in the current scenario where we consider the decoherence of oam entangled states in atmospheric turbulence , we find that the system is not one that evolves in time , but rather in space @xcite .",
    "the quantum states represent excitations of an optical beam propagating in a particular direction through space , which we define as the @xmath6-axis .",
    "in this situation it is more convenient to integrate over @xmath4 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 and thereby fix @xmath3 .",
    "the reason is that the system s evolution is considered as a function of the propagation distance and not as a function of time .",
    "moreover , the input is specified as a function on a two - dimensional plane perpendicular to the propagation direction for all time ( as opposed to a three - dimensional function through all space at a fix initial point in time ) .",
    "such an input can also be expressed in the fourier domain as a function of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 . in the monochromatic case one can fix @xmath4 and then end up with a two - dimensional function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .    it should be noted that by fixing the @xmath6-axis as the propagation direction , one explicitly breaks the rotation symmetry , which forms part of the lorentz symmetry . as a result",
    "our final expression implies an explicit breaking of lorentz invariance .",
    "nevertheless , our initial formulation should still be lorentz invariant to ensure consistency .",
    "we therefore start with expressions that are defined in terms of lorentz covariant integrals over @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . performing a change of variables",
    ", we then end up with quantities that are defined in terms of integrals over @xmath4 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",

    "this is because the transformation of the density operator during propagation over an infinitesimal distance through turbulence is caused by the distortion of the momentum space wave functions .",
