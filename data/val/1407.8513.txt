    "many real - world complex systems ranging from society to critical infrastructure operate through multiple layers of distinct interactions among constituents as well as the interplay between these interaction layers @xcite .",
    "multiplex network @xcite is a class of networks introduced to model such systems , in which the same set of nodes ( say , individuals in a society ) are connected via more than one type of links ( say friendships , kinships , co - workerships , _ etc _ ) .",
    "each type of links in multiplex networks forms the network layer .",
    "the study on multiplex networks is one of the major contemporary topics of network theory @xcite , together with closely related topics such as interacting networks @xcite , interdependent networks @xcite , and interconnected networks @xcite ,  _ etc . _",
    "introduction of distinct layers in multiplex networks necessitates new conceptual as well as computational developments beyond the well - established single - network framework @xcite , as one has to properly deal with the coupling between layers as well .",
    "one such factor is the pattern of multiplexity , that is , how the layers are coupled structurally . in real - world multiplex systems ,",
    "the coupling structure between layers should by no means be random but correlated . the term correlated multiplexity was introduced to refer to this correlation property @xcite .",
    "correlation properties of the layer coupling have been assessed empirically @xcite in term of the interlayer degree correlation and the link overlap , and indeed both were found to be significant .",
    "effect of the interlayer degree correlation has been theoretically investigated for percolation @xcite and network robustness @xcite in multiplex networks ( see also related studies on the interdependent networks @xcite ) . the multiplex network model based on the coevolution of layers",
    "@xcite has been proposed to model the emergence of interlayer degree correlation in evolving multiplex networks .",
    "a more comprehensive framework for characterization of the correlation properties of multiplex networks has recently been proposed @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , in social network literature the existence and consequences of link overlaps across social network layers have been the central issues of multiplexity studies , proving to play instrumental roles in social structure and dynamics in diverse ways @xcite .",
    "however , most theoretical studies on multiplex networks thus far have focused on the case of randomly coupled sparse layers , thereby the effect of the link overlap across layers has largely been ignored . only recently two groups of researchers have investigated explicitly the effect of link overlap for the problem of mutual percolation @xcite using different theoretical approaches and obtained different conclusions about the existence of tricritical point .    mutual percolation is a percolation model originally introduced for interdependent networks @xcite yet applicable to multiplex networks straightforwardly @xcite .",
    "a pair of nodes in multiplex network are said to be mutually connected if the pair is connected through each and every layer in the network .",
    "a set of nodes within which every pair is mutually connected form the mutually - connected component , or the mutual component for short .",
    "if there exists an extensive mutual component , called the giant mutual component , we say that mutual percolation has occurred and the system is mutual - percolated .",
    "the mutual percolation is a minimal model of cooperative coupling between layers in multiplex systems .",
    "recently the so - called viability of multiplex networks has been introduced @xcite ( see also closely related weak percolation models proposed in @xcite ) .",
    "the viability of multiplex networks is based on the concept of multiple resource demands for proper functioning in multiplex systems .",
    "for such kind of systems , a node can be viable only when it is supplied with each and every kind of resources successfully through corresponding network layer . as we will see in the following sections , the problem of viability of multiplex networks turns out to include the mutual percolation as a particular limit @xcite , thus provides unifying framework for existing different approaches for mutual percolation with link overlap @xcite , thereby helps clarify how and why the two studies produce different results .",
    "thus we study in this article the effect of link overlap on the viability of multiplex networks @xcite with two - fold objectives : i ) to present generalized theoretical formalism and understanding of the problem of viability of multiplex networks with link overlap ; and ii ) to clarify the discrepancy of existing results for the mutual percolation with link overlap by way of the limiting case of the multiplex viability problem .",
    "the rest of the article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : viability ] , we introduce the model of viability in multiplex networks and summarize main results from @xcite .",
    "effect of the link overlap on viability is investigated in section  [ sec : viability - overlap ] . as a limiting case of the viability problem",
    ", we revisit the mutual percolation with link overlap and discuss about the two existing approaches  @xcite in section  [ sec : mutual ] .",
    "implications to the network robustness under random link failures in networks with link overlap are investigated in section  [ sec : robustness ] .",
    "finally summary and discussions in section  [ sec : conclusion ] will follow .",
    "the viability of multiplex networks was introduced @xcite based on the concept of multiple resource demands for proper functioning in multiplex systems such as the civil society  @xcite and biological systems  @xcite .",
    "for example , in the case of society , our life in modern society relies on interrelated infrastructure networks including water supply networks , gas supply networks , and power grid systems @xcite . in such systems , simultaneous connectivities of a node with the nodes producing resources ( thereafter called the resource nodes ) , such as power plants in the power grid and water sources in the water supply networks , through a series of functioning nodes",
    "are essential for the proper functioning , _",
    "i.e. , _ to be viable . in this section",
    "we briefly summarize the previous work @xcite to outline the viability model and its solution properties , before generalizing it to cases with overlapping links in the following sections .",
    "for more details and additional results regarding the multiplex viability model the reader is referred to @xcite",
    ".      let us consider a network with @xmath0-multiple layers , where each layer of the multiplex network corresponds to a certain infrastructural network .",
    "a given fraction @xmath1 of resource nodes generates and distributes resources essential to be viable .",
    "a key assumption of the model is that only viable nodes can function properly and transmit resources further to their connected neighbors .",
    "then , a node is viable only if it can reach , via the viable nodes , to a resource node in each and every layer .",
    "one is interested primarily in what fraction of the nodes would be viable for given network parameters and distribution of resource nodes .",
    "specifically , we define the viability @xmath2 to be the fraction of viable nodes in the limit @xmath3 .    to identify clusters of viable nodes ( or viable clusters for short ) in a given network , two algorithms were proposed @xcite , called the cascade of activations ( ca ) and deactivations ( cd ) , respectively .",
    "how the two algorithms proceed when applied to a small multiplex network of @xmath4 nodes with two layers ( without overlapping links ) is illustrated in fig .  1 .     at each step .",
    "reproduced from ref .",
    "@xcite . ]",
    "[ fig : algorithm - viability ]        [ fig3 ]    the ca algorithm runs as follows :    * initially all nodes except resource nodes are labeled unviable .",
    "* at each step , unviable nodes that are linked to viable nodes through each and every layer [ colored green in fig .",
    "1(a ) ] are activated to become viable . *",
    "this cascade of activations continues until no nodes newly become viable .",
    "the cd algorithm runs as follows :    * initially all nodes including resource nodes are labeled viable .",
    "* at each step , the nodes that do not reach the resource nodes in any of the layers [ colored green in fig .",
    "1(b ) ] are deactivated to become unviable . *",
    "this cascade of deactivations continues until there are no nodes to deactivate .",
    "note that the viable clusters obtained from the ca and cd algorithms can be in general different from each other , as exemplified in fig .  1 . while the viable nodes for the ca are always viable for the cd as well , it is not always so _ vice versa_. this already suggests that the problem of multiplex viability can have multiple solutions , depending on the system s history .",
    "to gain more insight , we compute the viability analytically .",
    "this can be done for the cases of multiplex networks with layers that are locally - tree - like ; we further assume that the layers are coupled randomly , so that the link overlaps among layers are negligible for sparse networks we consider ; finally , resource nodes are assumed to be distributed randomly over the network .    in @xmath0-layer networks ,",
    "each node has @xmath5 degrees over different layers drawn from the joint degree distribution @xmath6 . to calculate viability , we first consider the probability @xmath7 that the node reached by following a randomly chosen @xmath8-type link ( @xmath9 is not viable . given the initial fraction @xmath1 of randomly distributed resource nodes on locally - tree like structures , @xmath7 s satisfy the following self - consistency equations , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the mean degree of the @xmath8-layer network .",
    "the first term is the probability that the chosen node is a resource node .",
    "the second term is the probability that it is connected with viable nodes through each type of links .",
    "the viability @xmath2 is obtained as the probability that a randomly chosen node is viable , which is given in terms of @xmath7 s by @xmath12 by solving eqs .",

    "( 12 ) reduce to those of mutual percolation @xcite with the viability @xmath2 identified with the size of the giant mutual component .",
    "we illustrate basic features of the multiplex viability model with a specific example of the multiplex networks with two randomly - coupled erds - rnyi ( er ) layers ( duplex er graphs ) . for simplicity the mean degrees of two layers",
    "are chosen to be the same , denoted as @xmath14 .",
    "then eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) reduce to a single equation for @xmath2 as @xmath15 by solving eq .",
    "( 3 ) , @xmath2 can be obtained for given @xmath1 and @xmath14 .",
    "( 3 ) is found to have two stable solutions for a range of parameters .",
    "one can construct the @xmath16 phase diagram [ fig .",
    "2(a ) ] , in which the low and high viability phases are separated by the two lines of loci of the saddle node bifurcations .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the points at which the viability for the ca algorithm undergoes a discontinuous change , and the dashed line indicates that for the cd algorithm . between the two lines ( hysteresis region ) , there are two possible stable solutions , and @xmath2 is determined by its initial value .",
    "for example , for the ca algorithm , @xmath2 keeps to be in low viable state with increasing @xmath14 until the abrupt jump at @xmath17 on the solid line . for the cd case",
    ", high viability sustains until abrupt collapse at @xmath18 on the dashed line [ fig .",
    "two lines merge at the critical point located at @xmath19 . above @xmath20 ,",
    "the viability changes gradually without discontinuity as @xmath14 increases and the distinction between the two phases disappear .",
    "such a bistability leads to a hysteresis in viability of multiplex networks [ fig .",
    "in order to demonstrate the hysteresis explicitly , let us suppose the following scenario of a sequence of systemic collapse and subsequent recovery of viability .",
    "initially the system is in high viability state with well - established networks ( that is , sufficiently large @xmath14 ) .",
    "as @xmath14 decreases due to random failures of links , @xmath2 abruptly collapses at @xmath18 .",
    "after collapse , if one tries to restore viability to the level before the collapse , one needs to increase the link density up to @xmath17 , which is significantly larger than the point of collapse @xmath18 .",
    "this suggests that the multiple resource demands lead to not only a potential danger of abrupt collapse but also an excessively severe complication in recovery . note that the bistability and hysteresis are absent in the single networks , @xmath21 [ fig",
    "in this section , we study the viability of multiplex networks with link overlap . with link overlap , one can still apply the ca and cd algorithms in a straightforward manner ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "however , one should note different roles of overlapping and non - overlapping links for mutual connectivity and viability . for ordinary connectivity , making link overlap over different layers",
    "does not extend the existing connected clusters but merely provides redundancy .",
    "for mutual connectivity , by contrast , the overlapping links can play distinctive role : a cluster formed by overlapping links ( hereafter called the overlap cluster for short ) is by itself a mutually - connected component .",
    "consequently the whole overlap cluster becomes viable once any of its member nodes becomes viable .",
    "similarly , the overlap cluster becomes deactivated also as a whole .    in what follows",
    "we will focus on the duplex systems .",
    "generalizations for @xmath22 cases will be discussed later . given the distinct roles of non - overlapping and overlapping links , it is useful to represent the degree of a node by distinguishing the two classes .",
    "therefore we use the vectorial degree @xmath23 for each node where @xmath24 @xmath25 is the degree for non - overlapping link of type @xmath8 and @xmath26 is for overlapping links , all of which are drawn from the joint degree distribution @xmath6 .",
    "we further assume that the layers are randomly coupled as well as the overlapping and the non - overlapping degrees are uncorrelated .",
    "we provide analytic treatments for the ca and the cd algorithms , respectively , for viability in the presence of link overlap .",
    "it is shown that the two algorithms are described by different sets of equations , displaying a rich variety of behaviors in viability .",
    "[ fig : algorithm - overlap ]      to become viable in the ca algorithm , a node must be connected individually with viable nodes either through both types of links simultaneously or through overlapping links .",
    "accounting for this , the self - consistency equations for the probabilities @xmath7 ( @xmath27 ) that the node reached by following a randomly chosen type-@xmath8 nonoverlapping ( overlapping ) link is not viable in the ca algorithm thus can be written as @xmath28 , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "we found as expected that overlapping link removals are significantly more detrimental than non - overlapping link removal in both system s viability [ fig .",
    "9(a ) ] and mutual connectivity [ fig .",
    "surprisingly , removals of only one of the overlapping links are quite closely as efficient as the removals of the entire overlapping links , reflecting the critical role of the link overlap .",
    "such a critical role of link overlap may provide mechanistic basis for understanding of the importance of multiplexity in social context @xcite . finally , it is also observed that removing the non - overlapping links in a particular layer is more efficient to break the network down than the removals of the same number of non - overlapping links from any layers .",
    "in this article , we have studied the effect of link overlap in the viability of multiplex networks , both analytically and numerically .",
    "distinctive role of overlapping links in viability and mutual connectivity is emphasized and exploited for setting up analytic framework properly .",
    "especially , it was shown that with link overlap the ca and the cd algorithms for the viability are described by different equations . as a result , a rich phase diagram for viability is obtained and the hysteretic patterns of viability become greatly diversified in the presence of link overlap . mutual percolation with link overlap",
    "is revisited as the @xmath13 limit of the cd case of multiplex viability problem , and controversy between existing results was clarified . for duplex",
    "random graphs , the transition is obtained to be discontinuous as long as @xmath101 at the transition , thus the tricritical point is absent .",
    "the distinctive role of overlapping links was demonstrated explicitly by the different responses of the network under random removals of overlapping and non - overlapping links , respectively , as well as under several removal strategies .",
    "our results show that the link overlap strongly facilitate viability and mutual percolation as the overlapping links form mutually - connected cluster by themselves . at the same time , by forming cluster the effect of link overlap can become long - ranged , posing challenge in analytical approach to the problem .",

    "i.e. _ , when the overlapping links span across all the layers .",
    "in case of the partial overlap , for instance when some links overlap across only two of three layers , the present approach can not be readily applied , although the numerical algorithm can .",
    "it is left an open problem to establish theory for the cd algorithm with general overlaps . the theory for ca algorithm , eqs .",
    "( 45 ) , however , would be extended to @xmath0-layers straightforwardly by generalizing the degree vector to include the partially overlapping link degrees as well .",
    "speaking in clich , the link overlap is more than sum of its part links .",
    "the impact of link overlap on multiplex network dynamics is expected be seen widespread given its strong empirical evidences across diverse real - world systems and generic nontrivial role for cooperative couplings between layers .",
    "these may include , but not limited to , cascading failure @xcite , cooperative infection @xcite , information spreading @xcite , and social behavioral cascade @xcite , opening a wide opportunity for future studies .",
    "lastly , the cd and ca algorithms for the multiplex viability can be thought of as multiplex generalizations of the classic bootstrap percolation @xcite and diffusion percolation @xcite , respectively . in this respect ,",
    "the study of viability problem in low dimensions could be of interest , too .",
