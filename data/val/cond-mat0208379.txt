    "the authors of @xcite discuss an alternative explanation of their data , postulating a correlated tunneling process depending only on intrinsic properties of the quantum dot .",
    "however , in view of the existing knowledge about the behaviour of metal - to - nanotube contacts , we consider the straightforward explanation given here rather persuasive .",
    "we demonstrate that contacts to quantum wires strongly influence transport through a one - dimensional quantum dot system .",
    "recent experiments on both cleaved - edge overgrowth and carbon nanotube quantum wires can thus be reconciled with the tomonaga - luttinger model of the one - dimensional electron liquid .",
    "non - fermi - liquid transport properties such as power - laws governing the height of coulomb blockade peaks were previously interpreted only through characteristics of the quantum dot itself .",
    "however , the power - laws in the temperature dependence of the cb maxima can be modified or superseded by the effect of inhomogeneous contacts ( ceo s ) or tunnel junctions ( nanotubes ) .",
    "depending on the energy regimes where the measurements are carried out , the linear conductance is either a local probe establishing the interaction parameter near the dot , or a global probe of a larger system including extended one - dimensional excitations and external contacts .",
    "the temperature distinguishing between these two regimes is either determined by the length scale on which an inhomogeneous interaction changes ( ceo s ) , or by the ratio of the contact and buckle tunneling resistances ( nanotubes ) .",
