    "we have shown that ideal pulsars calculated in the force - free limit of strong - field electrodynamics ( sfe ) dissipate a large fraction of the poynting flux in the singular current layer outside the light cylinder ( gruzinov 2011 ) .",
    "this result  finite damping in an ideal system  is not really that unusual .",
    "burgers equation , for instance , with viscosity @xmath0 , dissipates finite energy in infinitely thin shocks .",
    "the standard axisymmetric pulsar magnetosphere features a nearly head - on , gruzinov ( 2005 ) ] collision of poynting fluxes right outside the light cylinder .",
    "it is to be expected , although merely by common sense , that such a collision should be accompanied by damping .",
    "here we show that our sfe solution also obtains from the standard force - free magnetosphere equation of scharlemant & wagoner ( 1973 ) , if one uses the `` correct '' boundary condition at the equatorial current layer .",
    "we propose that the `` correct '' boundary condition at the singular current layer ( which now exists only outside the light cylinder ) is [ bc ] b^2-e^2=0 .",
    "this condition is lorentz invariant , comes up in the sfe simulations , and has a clear physical meaning ( at equator , the field becomes electric - like in order to drive large current )",
    ".    we can not be sure that our proposal works , until one justifies the full sfe , or just eq.([bc ] ) , microscopically .",
    "but conversion of 50% of the poynting flux into the ohmic power ( radiation , electron - positron pairs ) occurring close to the light cylinder must have consequences for the pulsar phenomenology , and needs to be studied .    in  2",
    "we derive the pulsar magnetosphere equation and explain how contopoulos , kazanas & fendt ( 1999 ) solve it . in ",
    "3 we put together all the equations which are needed to calculate the pulsar magnetosphere . in ",
    "4 we describe the numerical solution and the corresponding physics results .",
    "goldreich & julian ( 1969 ) proposed that neutron star magnetospheres obey the force - free condition [ ff ] + * j*=0 .",
    "surprisingly , it turns out that this simple equations allows a full calculation of the pulsar magnetosphere ( scharlemant & wagoner 1973 , contopoulos , kazanas & fendt 1999 , gruzinov 2005 , spitkovsky 2006 ) .    for the stationary axisymmetric case ,",
    "the calculation is as follows . using axisymmetry and stationarity , in cylindrical coordinates",
    "@xmath1 , we represent the fields by the three scalars @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , which depend on @xmath5 and @xmath6 but not on @xmath7 : [ stat ] * e * = - ,   * b*=1r(-_z , a,_r ) , where the subscripts denote the partial derivatives .",
    "we plug ( [ stat ] ) into ( [ ff ] ) and use @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we also use the boundary conditions at the surface of the star  the continuity of the normal component of the magnetic field and the tangential component of the electric field .",
    "we use the pulsar units = = c=1 , where @xmath10 is the magnetic dipole moment of the star .",
    "it is assumed that the magnetic field is a pure dipole near the surface inside the star .",
    "the star is assumed to be a perfect conductor .",
    "@xmath11 is the angular velocity of the star .",
    "we get = ,   a = a ( ) , where @xmath4 is an arbitrary function of @xmath3 , and we also get the `` grad - shafranov - like '' pulsar magnetosphere equation for @xmath3 [ pme ] ( 1-r^2)-2r_r+f()=0 . here",
    "@xmath12 , and @xmath13 , where the prime denotes the @xmath3-derivative . the pulsar magnetosphere equation ( [ pme ] )",
    "is solved outside the star r^2+z^2>r_s^2 , with the boundary condition at the surface of the star = r^2r_s^3 ,   r^2+z^2=r_s^2 .",
    "the pulsar magnetosphere equation ( [ pme ] ) contains @xmath14  an arbitrary function of @xmath3 , and it is not clear how one should solve it .",
    "this was explained and done by contopoulos , kazanas & fendt ( 1999 ) ( ckf ) .",
    "the pulsar magnetosphere equation is elliptical both inside and outside the light cylinder , and can therefore be solved if some conditions are given at all boundaries and if @xmath14 is known .",
    "we first pick a trial @xmath14 .    then inside the light cylinder",
    ", we have all the boundary conditions : ( i ) we know @xmath3 at the surface of the star , ( ii ) @xmath15 at @xmath16 , ( iii ) at @xmath17 the boundary condition is given by the pulsar magnetosphere equation itself , @xmath18 .",
    "so we can find @xmath3 inside the light cylinder , say by the relaxation method using the variation principle .    outside the light cylinder ,",
    "ckf postulate the boundary condition at the equator , ( r,0)=(1,0 ) ,  r>1 . then , with some boundary conditions at infinity ( we use @xmath15 at @xmath16 and @xmath19 at @xmath20 ) , and with the same boundary condition at the light cylinder , @xmath18 at @xmath17 , one can solve the pulsar magnetosphere equation outside the light cylinder too .    for a generic @xmath14 , this procedure gives a solution with @xmath21 .",
    "but one might hope that there is a ( unique ? )",
    "@xmath14 which gives a smooth solution .",
    "ckf use a feedback procedure  numerical adjustment of @xmath14 leading to a smooth light cylinder crossing .    in our case ,",
    "the boundary condition at the equator outside the light cylinder is ( r^2 - 1)()^2=a^2 ,  z=0 ,  r>1 . at the light cylinder , @xmath17",
    ", this gives a(_0)=0 ,  _",
    "0(1,0 ) , meaning that there is no singular return current on the field line @xmath22 .",
    "the only singularity is the equatorial current layer .",
    "in summary , we solve the following pulsar magnetosphere equation [ pme1 ] ( 1-r^2)-2r_r+aa=0 , [ pme2 ] = r^2r_s^3 ,   r^2+z^2=r_s^2 , [ pme3 ] ( r^2 - 1)()^2=a^2 ,  z=0 ,  r>1 .",
    "the function @xmath23 is ( uniquely ? ) determined by the continuity at the light cylinder .",
    "the poynting power is @xmath24 .",
    "our numerical procedure is as follows .",
    "we pick a trial function g(r)>0 ,   g(r)<0 ,  r>1 ,  g(1)=1 . instead of the boundary condition ( [ pme3 ] ) , we impose ( r,0)=_0g(r ) ,   r>1 ,   _ 0(1,0 ) .",
    "we apply the ckf relaxation method to calculate @xmath25 ( ignoring the singular return current ) .",
    "then we calculate the field invariant at the equator outside the light cylinder i(r)=1r^2(a^2+()^2)-()^2 ,  z=0 ,  r>1 .",
    "we then _ manually _ chose @xmath26 , so as to make @xmath27 as close to zero as we can at all @xmath28 .",
    "it turns out , that g(r)=0.52 + 0.48r , nullifies @xmath27 to about the numerical accuracy .",
    "has been read off the sfe time - dependent simulation ( we then confirm that various other profiles @xmath26 do nt nullify @xmath27 to the accuracy shown in fig.1 . ) . what one really wants is a ckf - type feedback loop , which would adjust @xmath26 so as to nullify @xmath27 . or",
    ", maybe , one can enforce the correct boundary condition ( [ pme3 ] ) throughout the @xmath14 relaxation .",
    "we were unable to develop a numerical scheme which would solve the problem ( [ pme1 ] - [ pme3 ] ) all by itself . ]",
    "one gets the spin - down power ( the poynting flux at the stellar surface = the poynting flux through the light cylinder ) : l_sd 0.9 ^ 2 ^4c^3 . the ohmic power ( the poynting flux on the field lines that cross the equatorial current layer ) is l_ohm 0.5l_sd . the ohmic power between 1 and 1.5 light cylinder radii is l_ohm 1.5 0.1l_sd ."
