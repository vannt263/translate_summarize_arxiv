    "the new generation of deep wide surveys can play a key role in setting a tight upper limit on the neutrino mass , and possibly detect it if the true neutrino mass is sufficiently high .",
    "this is due to the order of magnitude increase in volume of the new surveys .",
    "here we study specifically the ability to set an upper limit on the neutrino mass from the galaxy clustering expected in the photometric redshift survey dark energy survey ( des ) , combined with planck cmb measurements .",
    "the reason a survey like des would be effective is its large volume , @xmath0 gpc@xmath1 , and large number of galaxies , @xmath10 million .",
    "crudely , for a spectroscopic survey , where accurate redshifts are known , the error on the power spectrum scales with the survey effective volume @xmath11 as @xmath12 on the other hand , the suppression is proportional in the linear regime to @xmath13 @xcite , where @xmath14 we expect therefore ( when all other cosmological parameters are fixed ) that the determination of the upper limit on the neutrino mass would be inversely proportional to @xmath15 . from the 2df galaxy spectroscopic redshift survey , covering a volume of roughly 0.2 @xmath16 , the upper limit on the sum of neutrino",
    "mass is about 2 ev at 95 % cl @xcite .",
    "had des been a spectroscopic survey with volume of about 20 @xmath16 , i.e. 100 times larger , we would expect an upper limit of 0.2 ev on the sum of neutrino mass .",
    "our detailed calculation below yields an upper limit of 0.1ev for des&planck .",
    "this is tighter than the above back - of - the - envelope calculation , probably as planck priors are incorporated , and the effective volumes above are only given crudely .",
    "however , des is photometric redshift survey , so the radial component of distance to galaxies is significantly degraded , resulting in a poorer estimate of the power spectrum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore we prefer in this analysis to quantify the galaxy clustering as angular ( spherical harmonic ) @xmath17 power spectrum derived in photometric redshift shells which are wide enough relative to the photometric redshift errors , and to derive the resulting upper limits more carefully and quantitatively .",

    "the survey will be carried out using the blanco 4-m telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) in chile .",
    "the main objectives of the survey are to extract information on the nature and density of dark energy and dark matter using galaxy clusters , galaxy power spectrum measurements , weak lensing studies and a supernova survey .",
    "this will be achieved by measuring redshifts of some 300 million galaxies in the redshift range @xmath22 , tens of thousands of clusters in the redshift range @xmath23 and about 2000 type 1a supernovae out to redshift @xmath24 .",

    "the bias factor of a class of galaxies increases with redshift in opposition to the decreasing linear growth factor , in order to reproduce the observed approximate constancy of the small - scale clustering length ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "fortunately there are several independent ways of controlling this systematic effect : ( i ) modelling the biasing via halo model or semi - analytic simulations , and marginalising over the biasing parameters ; ( ii ) estimating the neutrino mass from galaxy power - spectra derived for different galaxy types and checking for consistency ; ( iii ) estimating the biasing empirically from weak - lensing map to be produced e.g. from des itself ; ( iv ) estimating biasing from high order statistic such as the bi - spectrum .",
