    "theoretical prediction on superfluidity of bound electron - hole pairs in electron - hole bilayers @xcite and , especially , in quantum hall bilayers @xcite has stimulated experimental study of the counterflow transport in such systems . in these experiments",
    "@xcite electrical current is passed through one layer in a given direction and returned to the source through the other layer in the opposite direction .",
    "the counterflow currents in the adjacent layers can be provided by excitons that consist of an electron belonging to one layer and a hole belonging to the other layer .",
    "one can expect that at low temperature the gas of such excitons becomes superfluid and the counterflow current may flow without dissipation .    in the counterflow experiments @xcite",
    "bilayer quantum hall systems with the total filling factor @xmath0 are used . at such a filling the number of electrons in one layer coincides with the number of empty quantum states ( holes ) in the lowest landau level in the other layer . at rather small interlayer distances @xcite the ground state of such",
    "a system is the bcs - like state with electron - hole pairing .",
    "the pairing is caused by the coulomb attraction .",
    "the bcs - like state can also be considered as a superfluid state of interlayer excitons .    in spite of expectation to reach at low temperature zero electrical resistance , counterflow experiments in quantum hall bilayers",
    "give some other results .",
    "at all temperatures a finite longitudinal resistance is registered .",
    "it decreases exponentially under lowering of temperature , but it does not vanish completely .",
    "moreover , the counterflow longitudinal resistivity @xmath3 is even higher than the longitudinal resistivity measured in the parallel current geometry @xmath4 ( in which the electrical currents in the adjacent layers are equal in value and flow in the same direction ) .",
    "the excitons can not give a contribution into the conductivity in the parallel current geometry .",
    "therefore , the parallel current conductivity @xmath5 should be much smaller than the counterflow conductivity @xmath6 .",
    "the relation between the longitudinal resistivities is another one . at zero or small hall conductivity",
    "the longitudinal resistivity is in inverse proportion with the longitudinal conductivity .",
    "but for the conductivity tensor with a large hall component the longitudinal resistivity is in direct proportion with the longitudinal conductivity .",
    "the first case is realized for the counterflow geometry and @xmath7 .",
    "the parallel current geometry corresponds to the second situation and @xmath8 .",
    "exciton superfluidity can be imperfect due to phase slips caused by motion of vortices across the flow . in that case the counterflow resistivity is nonzero and , in principle , it can be larger than the parallel current resistivity . the smallness of @xmath9 can be accounted , for instance , for a small density of carriers that contribute into @xmath10 .",
    "the specifics of the exciton superfluidity in bilayer quantum hall systems is that the vortices carry electrical charges .",
    "such vortices not only bring to a decay of superflow , but also give a direct contribution into conductivity . as was argued in @xcite , due to such a two - fold role of vortices ,",
    "the counterflow and parallel current longitudinal resistivities coincide with each other ( in the absence of other essential factors that may contribute to the conductivity ) .",
    "the role of vortices in transport behavior of quantum hall bilayers was considered in ref .",
    "the consideration @xcite is based on the coherence network model @xcite . in this",
    "model superfluid excitons flow in a network formed by narrow links , and the dissipation is caused by vortices that cross these links . in @xcite the drag geometry experiments are analyzed . in this geometry",
    "@xcite the current flows through one layer and the resistivities are measured in both layers .",
    "the resistivities in the active ( drive ) layer @xmath11 and in the passive ( drag ) layer @xmath12 are connected with @xmath13 and @xmath14 by the relations @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the resistivities of the layer that is used as an active one in the drag geometry ( in case of imbalanced bilayers @xmath13 and @xmath14 are different for different layers ) .",
    "the resistivities @xmath17 and @xmath3 demonstrate thermally activated behavior .",
    "the activation energy depends asymmetrically on the imbalance of electron densities of the layers @xcite . as was shown in @xcite this behavior",
    "can be described under assumption that vortex mobilities are thermally activated quantities and their activation energies are different for different specie of vortices .",
    "the vortex configurations in strongly disordered quantum hall bilayers were studied in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that disorder should be rather strong to provide vortex proliferation .",
    "the ideas of @xcite are important for the understanding of transport properties of quantum hall bilayers .",
    "nevertheless , the question requires further study because a number of essential features should be explained .",
    "first of all , in all experiments the drag resistivity @xmath18 is negative and the counterflow resistivity @xmath3 is larger than the parallel current resistivity @xmath4 .",
    "actually , it is one of key points because in case of perfect exciton superfluidity @xmath18 should be positive and equal to @xmath17 .",
    "then , the origin of the counterflow hall resistivity remains unclear . also , the absolute value of @xmath3 observed experimentally is quite large and one can think about additional factors ( beside vortices ) that increase @xmath3 .    in this paper",
    "we present a model in which transport features of quantum hall bilayers are accounted for a special influence of imperfectness .",
    "we assume that due to imperfectness the local total filling factor deviates from unity and in some area @xmath19 , while in other areas @xmath20 . in the areas of the first ( second )",
    "type positive - charged ( negative - charged ) vortices emerge .",
    "besides , we imply that in some defect areas the interlayer phase coherence is destroyed completely . using the effective medium approach",
    "@xcite we compute the effective longitudinal and hall resistivities for the counterflow , parallel current and drag geometries .",
    "the results are in good agreement with the experiment .",
    "there are four species of vortices in the system considered @xcite . below they",
    "are notated by the index @xmath21 .",
    "the wave functions @xmath22 for the states with a single vortex can be presented as @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the operator of creation for an electron in the layer @xmath25 in the state with definite angular momentum @xmath26 : @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the polar angle counted according to the right - hand rule with respect to the magnetic field direction , and @xmath29 is the magnetic length .",
    "the @xmath30 and @xmath31 coefficients are @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the filling factor for the layer 1 , and @xmath35 is the filling factor for the layer 2 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the electron density in the layer @xmath25 .",
    "each vortex is characterized by distinct values of its vorticity and electrical charge .",
    "the vortex charge @xmath38 can be found from the corresponding wave function ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "one can see from ( [ 2 ] ) that the charge of a given vortex is fractional and is concentrated in a certain layer .",
    "we notate this layer by @xmath39 .",
    "the vortex is a state with a clockwise circular electrical current in one layer and a counterclockwise current in the other layer .",
    "we use the convention that the vortex has the positive vorticity @xmath40 if the electrical current associated with the vortex is a counterclockwise in the layer 1 and clockwise in the layer 2 . the vortex parameters for each specie are given in table [ t1 ] .",
    ".the vorticity @xmath41 , the electrical charge @xmath38 and the layer @xmath39 where the charge is concentrated , for four species of vortices [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the vortices nucleate in pairs .",
    "the components of the pair have the opposite vorticities . in the absence of electron deficit or",
    "excess the vortices in the pair have the opposite electrical charges , as well .",
    "the coulomb attraction results in an increase of the binding energy of the pair .",
    "therefore , free vortices at @xmath0 emerge at temperatures higher than the berezinskii - kosterlits - thouless ( bkt ) transition temperature    deviation of the total filling factor from unity forces the appearance of charge excitations that are transformed into vortex pairs . in a given pair",
    "each vortex has the fractional charge , but the sum of the charges is integer . in areas with electron deficit",
    "an equal number of vortices @xmath42 and 2 is nucleated , and equal number of vortices @xmath43 and 4 emerge in areas with electron excess . in a given area",
    "the vortices have the same sign of charge and due to coulomb repulsion the size of a bound vortex pair can be quite large .",
    "the energy of the pair is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the superfluid stiffness , @xmath46 is the distance between the vortices , and @xmath47 is the vortex core radius .",
    "the energy ( [ 17 ] ) is minimum at the distance @xmath48 . the quantity @xmath49 ( where @xmath50 is the concentration for one specie of vortices ) yields the ratio of the vortex pair size to the average distance between the vortices",
    ". one can expect that at @xmath51 a plasma of free vortices of opposite vorticities instead of a gas of vortex pairs emerges .",
    "using the mean field value of @xmath45 @xcite one finds that the condition @xmath52 corresponds to the critical vortex density @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the electron density of a completely filled landau level . the critical density @xmath55 is proportional to @xmath56 .",
    "it is known that the mean - field approximation overestimates the superfluid stiffness @xmath45 : it does not take into account quantum and thermal excitations , and the interaction with impurities that reduce the superfluid stiffness ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the actual critical density can be considerable smaller .",
    "let us consider the forces that act on a vortex .",
    "the vortices are electrically charged and the electric and magnetic components of the lorentz force are applied to them : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the electrical fields in the layer @xmath25 and @xmath59 is the vortex velocity .",
    "vortices carry the vorticity and in system with nonzero net current the magnus force @xmath60 emerges .",
    "this force can be obtained from the derivative of the electrical current energy with respect to the vortex position ( see , for instance , @xcite ) : @xmath61 here @xmath62 is the unit vector directed along the magnetic field , and @xmath63 is the gradient of the phase of the order parameter taken far from the vortex center .",
    "the net currents in the layers read as @xmath64 .",
    "the magnus force does not depend on the vortex velocity , because in the case considered this force is proportional to the difference of the net currents @xmath65 .",
    "this difference is the same in the lab reference frame and the reference frame connected with a moving vortex .",
    "we should also take into account the viscous force @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the viscosity parameter . in what follows",
    "we will imply the vortex motion is connected with thermally activated hops of vortices between pinning centers .",
    "is this case temperature dependence of the viscosity parameters can be approximated as @xmath68    in the stationary state the resultant force applied to the vortex is equal to zero @xmath69 eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) is fulfilled for each specie @xmath70 with nonzero density .    the motion of vortices across the flow results in a decay of the phase gradient .",
    "the rate of decay is @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the density of vortices of specie @xmath70 .",
    "antiparallel electrical fields applied to the layers may compensate this decay .",
    "they increase the phase gradient at the rate @xmath73 . in the stationary state",
    "the following condition should be satisfied @xmath74    having the vortex density one solves eqs .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) and finds the contribution of excitons and direct contribution of vortices into conductivity . to compute the conductivity tensor one should also take into account the bare conductivity of landau level .    in the bcs - like state",
    "each electron is distributed between two one - particle states with the same guiding center index and distinct layer indices .",
    "the system responds on the resultant electrical force @xmath75 ( @xmath76 is the total number of electrons ) in the same manner as a completely filled landau level responds on electrical field . in the latter case",
    "the electron gas moves as a whole with the drift velocity @xmath77 . in case of the bilayer system the expression for the drift velocity contains the effective field @xmath78 .",
    "the velocity @xmath79 can be also found from the condition that the electrical and magnetic components of the lorentz force applied to the whole system compensate each other , as it takes place for a completely filled landau level with negligible small relaxation @xmath80 the motion of an electron gas with the velocity @xmath79 yields the contribution into the electrical currents @xmath81 .",
    "thus , the electrical currents in the layer read as @xmath82 where @xmath83    tuning the magnetic field one can always fulfill the condition @xmath0 in average .",
    "but due to structural defects the local @xmath84 can be larger than unity in some areas and smaller than unity in other areas . for simplicity , we consider the system with two statistically distributed areas of equal fraction with local @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( @xmath85 ) . in these areas",
    "the vortex densities for certain @xmath70 are nonzero : @xmath86 in @xmath19 areas , and @xmath87 in @xmath20 areas ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "we start from the analysis of transport properties of balanced bilayers ( @xmath89 ) . in this case",
    "the electrical charges of the vortices are equal in modulus .",

    "( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 29 ] ) , we obtain @xmath108    @xmath109    the effective parallel current and counterflow resistivities are obtained from ( [ 36]),([37 ] ) by the operation of inversion of the conductivity tensor .",
    "we take into account that @xmath110 is the small parameter . in the leading order in @xmath110 the resistivities equal to @xmath111",
    "the negative sign of @xmath112 means that the induced drag voltage is opposite to the voltage drop in the drive layer .",
    "note that our model predicts rather small @xmath112 - it is quadratic in the small parameter @xmath110 .",
    "one can see that for large viscosity @xmath113 the resistivities @xmath114 , in an qualitative agreement with the experiment .",
    "the hall resistivities @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 are in the quantitative agreement with experimental data .",
    "let us now consider the case of imbalanced bilayers . in imbalanced systems",
    "the vortex charges differ not only in sign but in absolute value .",
    "the viscosity is caused by the interaction of vortices with the pinning centers , so one can assume that the corresponding activation energy depends on the vortex charge . according to table [ t1 ] , we introduce two viscocity parameters @xmath118 and @xmath119 . for simplicity , we restrict the analysis to the case of large viscosities @xmath120 . in this case",
    "one can neglect the difference of @xmath121 in @xmath20 and @xmath19 areas .",

    "one can see that the longitudinal resistivities of different layers are determined by different viscosities .",
    "therefore , the resistivities may demonstrate different temperature dependences .",
    "it was observed experimentally that the activation energy for the longitudinal resistivities is higher in the layer with larger electron concentration .",
    "it corresponds to the grows of @xmath129 under increase of the vortex charge @xmath38 .",
    "in addition , we note that in the leading order the hall resistivities ( [ 110 ] ) are not sensitive to the imbalance as it was seen in experiments .",
    "we have shown that due to specific relation between the vortex charge and the filling factor @xmath130 the resistivities @xmath131 and @xmath132 are very close to each other .",
    "they almost cancelled each other in the expression for the longitudinal drag resistivity , and the latter quantity ( see eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) ) is very small , in difference with experimental data that show considerable negative resistivity .",
    "it is important to note that in case of perfect exciton superfluidity the longitudinal drag resistivity should be positive and equal to the drive resistivity .",
    "indeed , any normal conductivity channel contributes into @xmath10 , so the resistivity @xmath9 should be nonzero . in the counterflow geometry the normal channel is shunted by superfluid excitons and can not result in nonzero @xmath3 .",
    "it yields @xmath133    in case of slightly imperfect exciton superfluidity the situation might be the following . an additional normal conductivity channel ( not connected with free vortices )",
    "increases both @xmath10 and @xmath6 .",
    "it results in an increase of @xmath9 , but in a decrease @xmath3 , so , it gives positive @xmath18 .",
    "in particular , bound vortex pairs ( which are charged are carry zero vorticity ) should work in this direction .",
    "thus , the question on the origin of negative longitudinal drag remains open .    in this section",
    "we will show that the negative drag can be accounted for the presence of defect areas , where the interlayer phase coherence is suppressed completely . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the case of balanced bilayers .    on a qualitative level",
    "the impact of defect areas can be understood as follows . in these areas",
    "the counterflow and parallel current conductivities are equal each other and coincide ( at least , approximately ) with the conductivities of a single layer with the filling factor @xmath134 .",
    "the longitudinal conductivity of a single layer @xmath135 is much smaller than the counterflow conductivity determined by the exciton channel , and in the counterflow geometry the defect areas work as a sort of an exclude volume .",
    "thus , the effective conductivity @xmath6 decreases and the effective resistivity @xmath3 increases . on the other hand , if the conductivity @xmath135 is of the same order as the conductivity determined by the direct contribution of charged vortices the defect areas have only a small impact on the resistivity @xmath4 .    to describe the influence of defect areas quantitatively",
    "we use the approach developed in @xcite . according to @xcite , in general case of unequal fractions of the components the effective longitudinal and hall conductivities of a two - component systems",

    "if the condition @xmath0 is fulfilled in average and local total filling factor deviates from unity , the excess electrons or holes induce vortex excitations that suppress the superfluidity . if one trusts in the explanation presented one could expect that concrete values of counterflow , parallel current and drag resistivities are not universal quantities and may vary from sample to sample .    the problem of negative longitudinal drag resistivity forces to put forward the idea on the existence of areas with completely destructed interlayer coherence",
    "this idea looks quite reasonable taking into account that real geometry of arms should result in essential edge effects ( the presence of edge areas with destructed interlayer coherence ) .",
