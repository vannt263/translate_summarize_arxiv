    "in the last decade , system of ultra - cold atoms has been one of the most actively studied area in atomic and condensed matter physics .",
    "its various physical properties have been investigated quite intensively by both experimental and theoretical methods@xcite . as dimensionality and interactions between particles are highly controllable and also there are no effects of impurities and defects , cold atomic system in an optical lattice is regarded as a  final simulator \" for quantum many - body systems and it sometimes elevates a purely academic theoretical model to a realistic one .    it is also expected that obtained knowledge of cold atomic systems gives useful insights into physical properties of strongly - correlated many - body systems . in the present paper",
    ", we shall investigate a system of two - component bosons with strong repulsions .",
    "we shall first introduce a bosonic t - j model , which is an effective model of the bose - hubbard model@xcite with strong on - site repulsive interactions between atoms@xcite .",
    "the original t - j model of fermions is a canonical model for the high - temperature ( @xmath0 ) superconducting ( sc ) materials@xcite .",
    "the fermionic t - j model has been studied quite intensively since the discovery of the high-@xmath1 sc , but precise knowledge of its phase structure etc is still lacking partially because of difficulty of numerical study of the fermionic system .",
    "we expect that study on more tractable bosonic counterpart of the t - j model is useful to understand the strongly - correlated quantum systems including high-@xmath1 materials .",
    "this is one of our motivation to study the bosonic t - j model .",
    "another motivation of the present study is to see if some exotic state like the supersolid ( ss ) , which was theoretically predicted in single - component boson systems , exists in the multi - component system . in 2004 , it was reported that the ss state of @xmath2he , i.e. , solid with superfluidity ( sf ) , was observed by experiment@xcite .",
    "soon after this report , possibility of ss in cold atom systems was theoretically investigated .",
    "study of the hard - core bosons on a square lattice concluded that the realization of the ss was difficult in that system unless a long - range interaction exists@xcite . on the other hand for the hard - core bosons on a triangular lattice ,",
    "parameter region for possible ss state has been clarified@xcite . in the ss of single - component boson , a density wave and",
    "sf coexist . in the present paper , we shall study the possibility of ss in the two - component hard - core boson systems .",
    "it should be remarked that the ss state _ with paired superfluid and checkerboard order _ in the bosonic system corresponds to the coexisting phase of the antiferromagnetism ( af ) and sc in the electron system .",
    "recently this af and sc coexisting phase was really observed for highly homogeneous samples of high-@xmath1 materials@xcite . then it is quite interesting to see how the ss emerges in the present system .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we shall briefly review the derivation of the t - j model from the bose - hubbard model .",
    "slave - particle operators are introduced to express faithfully the hard - core nature of two - component bosons .",
    "then the model is studied by the mean - field theory .",
    "obtained phase structure at the total filling factor less than unity is shown .",
    "in particular , the phase diagram contains the parameter region corresponding to the ss . in sec.iii",
    ", we study the system by means of monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "the system in grand - canonical ensemble is studied rather in detail . at vanishing hopping of bosons ,",
    "the system reduces to a spin model . as it was already shown in the previous paper@xcite , this system has three phases at finite @xmath0 , i.e. , antiferromagnetic ( af ) , ferromagnetic ( fm ) and paramagnetic ( pm ) phases in terminology of spin model .",
    "then we turn on the hopping amplitude to investigate how the sf state appears .",
    "all the above three phases result in the sf phase as the hopping amplitude is increased .",
    "we are particularly interested in phase transition from the checkerboard insulating phase ( af phase ) to the sf .",
    "it is verified that the phase transition is of first order with a large hysteresis loop .",
    "this result indicates that a coexisting phase of the af solid and the sf may appear .",
    "we show that a phase separated ( ps ) state of the above two phases really exists at certain parameters .",
    "we investigate whether the josephson - like tunneling of sf through af solid takes place .    in sec.iv , we study the system in canonical ensemble with fixed total particle number . starting from the af",
    "solid , we increase the hopping amplitude and study how phase of the system evolves .",
    "we found that the system behaves rather differently depending on the density of atoms . at low - density region , there exists a single phase transition to the sf . on the other hand for high - density region",
    ", we found another phase besides those observed in grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "this new phase is composed of sf cloudlets ( finite magnitude of droplets ) in the af solid background .",
    "the system evolves as af crystal @xmath3 cloudlet state @xmath3 ps state @xmath3 sf",
    ". physical properties of each phase are investigated by calculating correlation functions and snapshots . in sec.v , we study effects of nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interaction between atoms . in particular we are interested in relation between a paired sf ( psf ) @xcite and the af order . in the absence of the nn interspecies attractive force , the psf does not appear and the sf of one - body atom has no af long - range order .",
    "however we found that by adding the nn interactions between atoms , the state with both the psf and af order emerges .",
    "this result gives an important implication to mechanism of the high-@xmath1 sc of the cuprates .",
    "section vi is devoted for conclusion .",
    "as explained in the introduction , we shall study the t - j model of hard - core bosons in the cubic lattice at finite temperature ( @xmath0)@xcite . hamiltonian of the t - j model is derived from the bose - hubbard model whose hamiltonian is given as , @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes site of the cubic lattice , @xmath6 is the unit vector in the @xmath7-th direction ( it also sometimes denotes the direction index ) , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are boson annihilation operators .",

    "for the original atomic model , the af phase corresponds to the state with the checkerboard symmetry of @xmath44 and @xmath45 atoms . on the other hand , the fm long - range order ( lro )",
    "means nonvanishing condensation @xmath46 , and sometimes it is called supercounter flow ( scf ) in the original atomic system . as holes are doped",
