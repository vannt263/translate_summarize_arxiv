    "the study of noncommutative ( nc ) geometry and its implications have gained considerable importance in recent times as these studies are motivated both from string theory @xcite as well as from certain condensed matter systems like the quantum hall effect @xcite . here",
    "the canonical nc structure is given by the following operator valued space - time coordinates , @xmath0 = i\\theta^{\\mu \\nu}. \\label{1a}\\ ] ] instead of working with functions of these operator - valued coordinates , one can alternatively work with functions of @xmath1-numbered coordinates provided one composes the functions through the @xmath2 product defined as @xcite @xmath3 ( x )   \\label{starprod } \\\\",

    "however , in general @xmath11 showing that the action of the group @xmath4 or @xmath5 is not an automorphism of the algebra @xmath12 , unless one considers the translational sub - group .",
    "this violation of poincar symmetry in particular is accompanied by the violation of microcausality , spin statistics and cpt theorem in general @xcite .",
    "these results , which follow from the basic axioms in the canonical ( commutative ) quantum field theory ( qft ) , are no longer satisfied in presence of noncommutativity in the manner discussed above . besides , nc field theories are afflicted with infra - red / ultra - violet ( ir / uv ) mixing .",
    "it is however possible for some of these results to still go through even after postulating weaker versions of the axioms used in the standard qft .",
    "for example one can consider the proof of cpt theorem given by alvarez - gaume et.al @xcite where they consider the breaking of lorentz symmetry down to the subgroup @xmath13 , and replace the usual causal structure , given by the light cone , by the light - wedge associated with the @xmath14 factor of kinematical symmetry group .",
    "one can also consider the derivation of cpt and spin - statistics theorems by franco et.al @xcite where they invoke only `` asymptotic commutativity '' i.e. assuming that the fields to be commuting at sufficiently large spatial separations .",
    "as all these problems basically stemmed from the above mentioned non - invariance ( [ gastarb ] ) , it is desirable to look for some way to restore the invariance . indeed , as has been discovered by @xcite and @xcite",
    "( see also the prior work of @xcite ) this invariance is restored by introducing a deformed coproduct , thereby modifying the corresponding hopf algebra . since then , this deformed or twisted coproduct has been used extensively in the framework of relativistic quantum field theory , as this approach seems to be quite promising .",
    "two interesting consequences follow from the twisted implementation of the poincar group .",
    "the first is that there is apparently no longer any ir / uv mixing @xcite , suggesting that the high and low energy sectors decouple , in contrast to the untwisted formulation .",
    "the second striking consequence is an apparent violation of pauli s principle @xcite .",
    "this seems to be unavoidable if one wants to restore poincar invariance through the twisted coproduct .",
    "if there is no ir / uv mixing , one would expect that any violation of pauli s principle would impact in either the high or low energy sector .",
    "experimental observation at present energies seems to rule out any effect at low energies , therefore if this picture is a true description of nature , we expect that any violation of the pauli principle can only appear at high energies .",
    "it does , therefore , seem worthwhile as a consistency check to investigate this question in more detail and to establish precisely what the possible impact may be at low energies and why it may not be observable .",
    "one of the quantities where spin statistics manifests itself very explicitly is the two particle correlation function .",
    "a way of addressing this issue would therefore be to study the low temperature limit of the two particle correlation function in a twisted implementation of the poincar group . since we are at low energies it would , however , be sufficient to study the non - relativistic limit , i.e. , the galilean symmetry .",
    "we therefore need to consider the question whether the galilean symmetry can also be restored by a suitable twist of the coproduct .",
    "this is a non trivial point that requires careful investigation , as the galilean algebra admits a central extension , in the form of mass , unlike the poincar case and the boost generator does not have a well defined coproduct action .",
    "it may be recalled , in this context , that the presence of space - time non - commutativity spoils the nc structure under galileo boost .",
    "this question is all the more important because of the observation made by @xcite that the presence of space - time non - commutativity does not spoil the unitarity of the nc theory .",
    "however , we show that the presence of space - time non - commutativity in the relativistic case does not have a well defined non - relativistic ( @xmath15 ) limit .",
    "furthermore , space - time non - commutativity gives rise to certain operator ordering ambiguities rendering the extraction of a non - relativistic field in the @xmath15 limit non trivial .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "we discuss mathematical preliminaries introducing the concept of hopf algebra and the deformed or twisted coproduct in section 2 .",
    "section 3 deals with a brief review of the twisted lorentz transformation properties of quantum space - time in sub - section ( 3.1 ) , as was discussed by @xcite .",
    "this is then extended to the non - relativistic case in sub - section ( 3.2 ) .",
    "we then discuss briefly the non - relativistic reduction of the klein - gordon field to the schrdinger field in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions in commutative space in section 4 , which is then used to obtain the action of the twisted galilean transformation on the fourier coefficients in section 5 .",
    "we eventually obtain the action of twisted galilean transformation on non - relativistic schrdinger fields in section 6 . in section 7",
    "we discuss the implications of the subsequent deformed commutation relations on the two particle correlation function of a free gas in two spatial dimensions .",
    "we conclude in section 8 .",
    "finally , we have added an appendix where we have included some important aspects of wigner - in@xmath16nu group contraction in this context ( i.e. poincar @xmath17 galileo ) , which we have made use of in the main text .",
    "in this section we give a brief review of the essential results in @xcite for the purpose of application in later sections .",

    "we denote this action by @xmath21 for @xmath22 and @xmath23 . then the group algebra @xmath24 also acts on @xmath19 . a typical element of @xmath24 is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is an invariant measure on @xmath18 .",
    "its action is @xmath27    both @xmath18 and @xmath24 act on @xmath28 , the tensor product of @xmath19 s over @xmath29 , as well .",

    "this restriction specifies @xmath33 on all of @xmath24 by linearity .",

    "finally , let us mention the action of the coproduct @xmath33 on the elements of a lie - algebra @xmath55 .",
    "the coproduct is defined on @xmath55 by @xmath56 its action on the elements of the corresponding universal covering algebra @xmath57 can be calculated through the homomorphism @xcite i.e. @xmath58 one can also easily check that this action of the coproduct on the lie - algebra is consistent with the action on the group element defined by @xmath59",
    "to set the scene for the rest of the paper , we give a brief review of the lorentz transformation properties in the commutative case in this subsection .",

    "@xmath89 one can generalise this to higher second rank tensors @xmath90 as @xmath91 since we can write @xmath92 where we have made use of ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "this indeed shows the covariant nature of the transformation properties of @xmath93 .",
    "we now review the corresponding covariance property in the nc case under the twisted coproduct of lorentz generators @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the issue of violation of lorentz symmetry in noncommutative quantum field theories has been known for a long time , since the field theories defined on a noncommutative space - time obeying the commutation relation ( [ 1a ] ) between the coordinate operators , where @xmath94 is treated as a constant antisymmetric matrix , are obviously not lorentz invariant .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that there exists a new kind of twisted poincar symmetry under which quantum field theories defined on noncommutative space - time are still poincar invariant .    to generalise to the nc case , first note that the star product between two vectors @xmath80 and @xmath95 given as @xmath96 is not symmetric , unlike in the commutative case .",
    "one can , however , write this as @xmath97 where the curly brackets @xmath98 denotes symmetrization in the indices @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "this can be easily generalised to higher ranks , showing that every tensorial object of the form @xmath101 can be written as a sum of symmetric tensors of equal or lower rank , so that the basis representation is symmetric",
    ". consequently @xmath102 should be replaced by the symmetrized expression @xmath103 , and correspondingly the action of the lorentz generator should be applied through the twisted coproduct ( [ newcoprod ] ) , @xmath104 in the above equation , @xmath105 denotes the usual lorentz generator , but with the action of a twisted coproduct . in @xcite",

    "we extend the above twisted poincar result to the corresponding non - relativistic case . to demonstrate the need for this , consider the galilean boost transformation , @xmath109 applied in the nc galilean space time having the following nc structure @xmath110 = i\\theta^{0 i } \\ \\ \\ ; \\ \\ \\",

    "note that with @xmath128 , @xmath126 does not have the right coproduct action ( [ 23 ] ) .",
    "this is also quite satisfactory from the point of view that the non - commutativity of space - time is an intrinsic property and should have no bearing on the mass of the system inhabiting it .",
    "we also point out another dissimilarity between the relativistic and non - relativistic case . in the relativistic case , the generators @xmath68 ( [ 4 ] )",

    "this was done by studying the action of the twisted galilean symmetry on the schrdinger field as obtained from a non - relativistic reduction of the klein - gordon field .",
    "here we had to consider the absence of any space - time noncommutativity as , otherwise one can not define a proper non - relativistic limit .",
    "the possible consequences of this deformation in terms of a violation of the pauli principle was studied by computing the two particle correlation function .",
    "the conclusion is that any possible effect of the twisted statistics only show up at very high energies , while the effect at low energies should be very small , consistent with current experimental observations .",
    "whether this effect will eventually be detectable through some very sensitive experiment is an open , but enormously interesting and challenging question .",

    "here we summarise the well known wigner - in@xmath16nu group contraction from poincar to galilean algebra in order to highlight some of the subtleties involved , as these have direct bearings on the issues discussed in section ( 3.1 ) .",
    "to begin with let us consider a particle undergoing uniform acceleration ` @xmath238 ' , along the @xmath239 direction , measured in the instantaneous rest frame of the particle .",
    "a typical space - time rindler trajectory is given by the hyperbola @xmath240 so that the acceleration @xmath241 w.r.t the fixed observer with the above associated coordinates ( @xmath242 ) measured at time @xmath118 is , @xmath243 since the frame @xmath244 appearing in ( [ 8 ] ) coincides with that of the fixed observer at time @xmath245 , we must have @xmath246 where @xmath20 is the distance measured at that instant from the origin . to take the non - relativistic limit",
    ", we have to take both @xmath150 and @xmath247 such that @xmath248 is held constant .",
    "for example , the corresponding non - relativistic expression @xmath249 for the distance travelled by the particle in time @xmath118 is obtained by identifying @xmath250 which reproduces the standard result .",
    "now let us consider the lorentz generator along the @xmath239 direction @xmath251 .",
    "this can be rewritten in terms of @xmath249 using ( [ 10 ] ) , @xmath252 note that @xmath253 by itself does not have any @xmath1 dependence , the non - relativistic limit of @xmath253 can thus be obtained by just taking the limit @xmath254 , which yields @xmath255 although this vector field indeed generates the integral curve in the @xmath118 , @xmath249 plane which is a parabola given by ( [ 10 ] ) , it can not be identified with the galileo boost generator because @xmath256 \\sim \\left ( p_i - p_j\\right ) .",
    "\\label{12b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the galilean algebra on the other hand is obtained by taking the limit @xmath15 of the commutators involving boost in the following way : @xmath257 & = & \\lim_{c \\to \\infty } \\frac{1}{c^2 }",
    "\\left [ m_{01 } , m_{02 } \\right ] = \\lim_{c \\to \\infty } \\frac{1}{c^2 } m_{12 } = 0 \\nonumber \\\\ \\left [ p_1 , \\bar{k_{1 } } \\right ] & = & \\lim_{c \\to \\infty } \\frac{1}{c } \\left [ p_1 , m_{01 } \\right ] = \\lim_{c \\to \\infty } \\frac{1}{c^2 } p_0 = i m \\nonumber \\\\ \\left [ \\bar{k_{1 } } , j \\right ] & = & \\lim_{c \\to \\infty } \\frac{1}{c } \\left [ m_{01 } , m_{12 } \\right ] = i \\bar{k_{2 } } , \\label{12a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath258 is identified as the mass .",
    "the rest of the commutators have the same form as that of poincar algebra .",

    "a simple inspection , at this stage , shows the following form of the galileo boost generators @xmath259 clearly the rest of the generators in galilean algebra have the same form as poincar algebra . for completeness",
    "we enlist the full galilean algebra in ( 2 + 1 ) dimension : @xmath260 & = & \\left [ p_i , p_j \\right ] =   \\left [ p_i , h \\right ] =   \\left [ j , h \\right ] = 0 \\nonumber \\\\ \\left",
