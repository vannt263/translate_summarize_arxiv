    "spin chains are an important theoretical model to understand properties of many - body systems such as quantum phase transitions  @xcite , and have become popular as a possible model for quantum computation ( qc ) and communication  @xcite .",
    "various types of spin - spin interactions including the heisenberg , xy and ising model have been discussed both analytically and numerically . among these ,",
    "the ising model is one of the most ubiquitous , arising in many different settings from atoms in optical lattices  @xcite , to nmr systems  @xcite to ion traps  @xcite and polar molecules  @xcite . for many of these systems addressing individual spins selectively",
    "is extremely difficult , limiting the type of control we can implement . for instance , for cold atoms in an optical lattice , addressing individual atoms with an external laser is very difficult as the waist of the controlling laser is on the scale of many lattice sites .",
    "one way to circumvent this problem is by eliminating the need for local addressing , i.e. , by using only control fields that act globally on all the spins at once .",
    "one type of global control was first proposed in  @xcite , where it was demonstrated that universal qc can be achieved by controlling the qubits collectively , and since then extensive work has been done on this approach  @xcite . however , in all of these proposals , the spin - spin interaction hamiltonian and the globally controlled hamiltonian are not sufficient to realize universal qc , and additional resources are necessary . for example , in  @xcite , the spin chain consists of two types of qubits , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , arranged in an alternating , repeating pattern : @xmath2 , and it is assumed that the two types of spin - spin interactions @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be switched on and off as needed , which is a demanding experimental requirement . in an improved scheme  @xcite , the coupling hamiltonian can be kept unchanged but the transition frequencies of each qubit must be tuned individually , which is still too difficult to implement for cold atoms in optical lattices at this time . in another scheme  @xcite ,",
    "the need for such `` individual tuning ability '' is avoided but at the expense of requiring a chain with a repeating pattern of four types of qubits , raising a high demand for the preparation process .",
    "if the goal is universal quantum computation then such extra requirements are necessary as a controllability argument shows that the system hamiltonian together with only a global control hamiltonian do not generate the full lie algebra @xmath5 but only a proper subalgebra , rendering the system uncontrollable .",
    "one interesting question therefore is what further assumptions are necessary for universal qc , a question that has been addressed in various recent papers  @xcite .",
    "however , there are many tasks that do not require controllability , and we can ask what interesting tasks we can perform using global control only , without additional resources .",
    "this is the focus of this article .",
    "in particular we demonstrate that global control alone is sufficient to steer an ising chain from a certain initial product state to a ghz state  @xcite . such ghz states ( or multi - qubit cat states or noon states , as they are variously called ) are of utmost importance for improving frequency standards beyond the classical realm @xcite , and could result in highly sensitive magnetometers @xcite .",
    "this is why recently there has been extensive interest in their experimental realization , for example , in ion traps @xcite and with multiple nuclear spins in a molecule @xcite .",
    "however , a fast/ non - adiabatic ( so as to be robust to decoherence ) method of generating these systems with minimal control , such as global fields on an ising chain , is still an open problem , and will be a very important milestone for realizing quantum enhanced sensing and standards .",
    "we again emphasize that all control schemes relying purely on global control are useful for experiments on the systems where individual addressability is not available .",
    "we show that with global control , certain ghz states can be reached in finite time from a given , easy - to - prepare product state , i.e. , that there always exists a control that achieves the task , and consider and compare three different methods to design suitable controls : adiabatic passage , lyapunov control design and optimal control .",
    "one of the most interesting issue of our proposal is that in all three methods the initial and final states are the eigenstates of the hamiltonian and hence the output state does not evolve anymore .",
    "this makes it convenient since no fine - tuning of the control time is necessary and the output state can be saved for further tasks .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in sec .  ii the model and control problems are defined . in sec .",
    "iii , controllability of the system , or rather lack of it , and reachability are discussed . in sec .",
    "iv three methods for ghz state generation are considered in detail , namely , adiabatic passage , lyapunov control and optimal control .",
    "finally , the effect of various procedural imperfections such as imperfect initialization , inhomogeneity and decoherence are studied in sec .",
    "v , followed by a brief summary and discussion of the results in sec vi .",

    "we choose @xmath8 and @xmath10 such that the total hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : hf ] ) is a uniform nearest - neighbor ising interaction in a transverse time - dependent magnetic field @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the pauli matrices .",
    "practically , one can think of @xmath11 as a time - dependent global magnetic field in the @xmath14-direction that causes all spins to rotate simultaneously , while all spins are constantly coupled via ising interaction .",
    "the field @xmath11 is varied with respect to time @xmath15 and at time @xmath16 takes @xmath17 .",

    "our main objective is to prepare an ising chain of length @xmath6 with hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : hf ] ) in one of the following ghz states    [ eqn : ghz - state ] @xmath20    starting in the ground state @xmath21 of the hamiltonian @xmath22 , i.e. , our aim is to find a magnetic field @xmath11 such that the system states evolves into one of the entangled ghz states given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ghz - state ] ) under the action of the resulting hamiltonian , starting from the initial state @xmath21 .    in the absence of the magnetic field , @xmath23 ,",
    "the ground state of the @xmath24 is two - fold degenerate , spanned by @xmath25 for @xmath26 , and @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "although the target states are ground states of the hamiltonian @xmath8 , due to the degeneracy cooling alone does not suffice to prepare the system in any of the states  ( [ eqn : ghz - state ] ) .",
    "rather , simple cooling will result in the system being left in a mixture of different ground states , which is not useful . on",
    "the other hand , in the presence of the magnetic field the ground state of the total hamiltonian @xmath24 with @xmath29 is non - degenerate , and if the system is cooled in the presence of a global field @xmath30 along the @xmath14-axis , it will be initialized in the ground state @xmath21 of @xmath24 . as @xmath31",
    "we have    @xmath32    where @xmath33 , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the eigenstates of @xmath36 , i.e. , for sufficiently large @xmath37 we can assume @xmath21 to be approximately equal to @xmath38 or @xmath39 .",
    "choosing @xmath37 large also ensures a sufficiently large energy gap for efficient cooling .",
    "the dynamics  ( [ control - dynamics ] ) can be expressed in terms of the unitary process @xmath40 satisfying @xmath41 with @xmath42 . denoting the solution of ( [ eqn : seu ] ) for a given control @xmath11 by @xmath43 , the reachable set of unitary operators @xmath44",

    "hence , if @xmath53 or @xmath54 then we have @xmath55 or @xmath56 , the system is controllable in that we can implement any unitary operator @xmath57 up to at most a global phase @xmath58 . in this case",
    "any pure state is reachable from any other pure state , and more generally , any two density operators with the same spectrum can be interconverted .",
    "since the spectrum of any operator is preserved under unitary evolution , this is the most we can hope for . in this sense , controllability is a sufficient condition for reachability . on the other hand , any system that possess symmetries will not be fully controllable . for the hamitonian @xmath59 ,",
    "if there exists a hermitian operator @xmath60 such @xmath61=0 $ ] for @xmath62 , then the hamiltonians @xmath8 and @xmath10 are simultaneously block - diagonalizable . in this case the hilbert space can be decomposed into orthogonal invariant subspaces @xmath63 such that any initial state @xmath64 remains in @xmath63 under the evolution , regardless of what control @xmath11 we apply .",
    "since no states outside @xmath65 can be reached from an initial state in @xmath65 , decomposability immediately implies non - controllability .",
    "however , a target state @xmath66 may still be reachable from an initial state @xmath67 if both belong to the same subspace . in particular",
    ", this is the case if the system is controllable on the relevant invariant subspace .",
    "applying these results to our ising chain subject to global control we see immediately that the system  ( [ eqn : h ] ) possesses symmetries as both hamiltonians @xmath8 and @xmath10 commute with the `` @xmath68-parity '' operator @xmath69 .",

    "this shows that the ising chain with global control is not controllable and explains why additional resources are required to obtain universal qc  @xcite .",
    "however , there are many useful tasks that can be performed under the evolution  ( [ control - dynamics ] ) .",
    "for @xmath77 there are further symmetries and both blocks are further decomposable .",
    "there are various approaches to decompose the hilbert space into invariant subspaces that are not further decomposable .",
    "one approach is to proceed as before and find the symmetry operators @xmath60 on each subspace .",
    "if @xmath78 is an eigenbasis of @xmath60 then @xmath79 will be block - diagonal .",
    "this can be done recursively until no further symmetries are found for any of the blocks , leaving us with indecomposable blocks .",
    "this approach becomes tedious , however , when there are many symmetries .",
    "alternatively , we can calculate the eigenvectors of a linear combination of the hamiltonians , @xmath80 .",
    "letting @xmath78 be a unitary matrix whose columns are the normalized eigenvectors of @xmath81 , we define an adjacency matrix @xmath82 with @xmath83 if the absolute value of the @xmath84th element of the matrix @xmath85 is greater than some threshold value @xmath86 , and @xmath75 otherwise , and find the connected components of @xmath0 , which define the respective invariant subspaces .",
    "the accuracy of this approach depends on suitable choice of @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath86 .",
    "choosing @xmath89 and @xmath90 , @xmath91 , we calculated the subspace decomposition for ising chains up to @xmath92 .",
    "having found a decomposition of the system into indecomposable subspaces the next step is to verify if the initial and target states both belong to the same invariant subspace . for @xmath26",
    "we verified numerically that both @xmath93 and the ghz state @xmath94 belong to the same invariant subspace for @xmath95 . to establish reachability",
    "the next step is usually to try to show that the system is controllable on this invariant subspace . for @xmath96 ,",
    "this is easy .",

    "one might therefore hope that the the system is controllable on the relevant invariant subspace @xmath102 for all @xmath6 .",
    "unfortunately , this is not true for higher dimensions . for @xmath109 , for instance , the smallest subspace @xmath102 that contains both @xmath101 and @xmath94 and is invariant under the hamiltonian has dimension @xmath110 , while the dynamical lie algebra @xmath50 generated by @xmath8 and @xmath10 on the entire space has only dimension @xmath111 .",
    "this is strictly smaller than the dimension needed for controllability on the subspace , which is @xmath112 for full controllability and @xmath113 for pure - state controllability for a six - dimensional subspace requires that we can generate the full lie algebra of ( trace - zero ) hermitian matrices @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) ; if we are only interested in pure - state controllability it suffices if we can generate symplectic lie algebra @xmath116 .",
    "see @xcite ] .",
    "hence , the system can not be controllable on @xmath102 .",
    "explicit calculations for various @xmath6 suggest that dynamical lie algebra on the entire hilbert space is a @xmath117-dimensional reducible representation of @xmath114 , and that the dynamical lie algebra on the smallest invariant subspace that contains both @xmath101 and @xmath94 is an irreducible representation of @xmath115 or @xmath114 . as for @xmath118 the dimension of the subspace",
    "@xmath102 is greater than @xmath6 , this implies non - controllability on @xmath102 for @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , in general a different approach is needed to show that @xmath94 is reachable from @xmath101 .",
    "similar problems arise when trying to assess the reachability or non - reachability of the other ghz states @xmath119 from @xmath101 or @xmath120 .",
    "we now discuss three different methods for generating ghz states ( [ eqn : ghz - state ] ) from the separable states @xmath101 or @xmath120 : ( i ) adiabatic passage ; ( ii ) lyapunov control and ( iii ) the optimal control theory .",
    "we shall see that adiabatic passage demonstrates asymptotic reachability of certain ghz states from certain product states .",
    "it is also has many benefits in that a simple field can achieve high fidelity and rather robust population transfer for spin chains of varying length .",
    "a general drawback of adiabatic schemes , however , is that the target state is exactly reachable only in the limit @xmath121 , and the time required to prepare the target state with sufficiently high fidelity can be long .",
    "this prompts the question whether we could do better using some form of optimal control design either lyapunov control or global optimal control .",

    "if we can show that a particular ghz state in ( [ eqn : ghz - state ] ) is the limit of the ground state of @xmath124 as @xmath125 , then it is possible to adiabatically transfer the system to one of the ghz states ( [ eqn : ghz - state ] ) .",
    "indeed , such a result has been implicitly shown for an ising `` chain '' with periodic boundary conditions  @xcite using the jordan - wigner transformation , and we can easily show directly that this result is true for proper chains using the fact that @xmath8 and @xmath10 simultaneously commute with the @xmath68-parity operator @xmath60 , and thus that @xmath126=0 $ ] regardless of the choice of @xmath9 and @xmath11 .",
    "we clearly have    @xmath127    this shows that @xmath101 always has positive parity , while @xmath120 has positive parity for @xmath6 even , and negative parity for @xmath6 odd .",
    "the same must hold for the finite values of @xmath30 , i.e. , the eigenstate @xmath128 has positive parity if @xmath129 , or @xmath130 and @xmath6 even , and negative parity if @xmath130 and @xmath6 odd .",
    "as the parity is a conserved quantity , the adiabatic limit state @xmath131 must have the same parity as @xmath21 .",
    "it is easy to see that the intersection of the two - fold degenerate ground state manifold of @xmath132 with the @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) eigenspace of @xmath60 is unique .",
    "for @xmath26 the ground state manifold of @xmath132 is spanned by the ghz states @xmath135 , and it is easy to see that @xmath94 has positive , and @xmath136 negative parity .",
    "for @xmath28 the ground state manifold of @xmath132 is spanned by the ghz states @xmath137 , and it is easy to see that @xmath138 has positive , and @xmath139 negative parity .",
    "thus we have    @xmath140    although adiabatic passage provides a way to drive the system to a certain ghz state @xmath66 in ( [ eqn : ghz - state ] ) , strictly speaking it only implies asymptotic reachability of @xmath66 from the given initial state @xmath21 as the adiabatic theorem provides that the error between the exact final state @xmath131 and @xmath66 will go to zero only as @xmath141 , i.e. , that the fidelity @xmath142 if the field @xmath11 changes sufficiently slowly so that the rate of the change of the ground state energy @xmath143 , is small compared to the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state , i.e. , @xmath144 .",
    "this is not really a problem in practice as we are likely to be satisfied if we can get sufficiently close to the target state in a finite time , and similar adiabatic schemes have indeed been proposed , e.g. , for strings of neutral atoms in  @xcite . moreover , under certain conditions asymptotic reachability implies finite - time reachability .",

    "lyapunov control can be considered as a kind of optimal control in that the distance from the target state is monotonically decreasing with time .",
    "this form of optimal control is sometimes referred to as local optimal control because at each point in time the control design is based only on information about the current state of the system and the target state . from a computational point",
    "its main advantage is that the control pulses can be calculated directly in a non - iterative fashion , but as the last section shows , for more complex problems such as longer chains this approach is not sufficiently powerful .",
    "an alternative method is to take a global approach , specify a target time @xmath46 , and attempt to maximize the fidelity @xmath207 by globally varying the control pulse @xmath11 in the allowed control function space .",
    "in practice , optimal control problems over function spaces can generally be solved only numerically , by parameterizing or discretizing the control @xmath11 .",
    "the simplest and most common approach is to subdivide the time interval @xmath208 $ ] and approximate the control @xmath11 by a constant on each subinterval @xmath209 .",
    "this results in an optimization problem over @xmath210 , where @xmath211 is the number of time intervals , which can be solved , e.g. , by starting with an initial trial field @xmath212 and iteratively refining @xmath213 such that the fidelity at the target time @xmath214 monotonically increases as a function of the iteration @xmath215 .",
    "the crucial part of this procedure is the way @xmath213 is updated in each iteration .",
    "we adopted here a quasi - newton method developed by boyden , fletcher , goldfarb , and shanno  @xcite .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the optimization process can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic and the lyapunov control pulses found earlier provide upper bounds on @xmath46 to reach a certain final fidelity @xmath216 , and our previous reachability considerations for ising chains with hamiltonian @xmath59 suggest that there exists a solution @xmath11 with @xmath217 for a finite time @xmath46 , although the proof does not give any hint as to the best driving field @xmath11 or how to discretize the control pulse .",
    "although it can be shown , roughly , that if the target state is reachable by some admissible control field then there also exists a piecewise constant control that achieves the same task , the theorem again does not tell us how many time steps are needed .",
    "if the resolution is too low , i.e. , @xmath218 is too large , the target fidelity may not be achievable .",
    "an interesting question for optimal control therefore is how fast we can hope to achieve transfer to the target state , and what time resolution of the field is required .",

    "@xmath9 is usually a few hundred hz , while we can easily achieve fields up to 50khz for liquid - state nmr and is a few hundred khz for solid - state nmr  @xcite , which would suggest a reasonable upper bound on the field amplitudes of perhaps @xmath220 . simulations for this problem suggest that bounds of this magnitude can usually be neglected as the unconstrained optimization solutions almost always satisfy these constraints , and unconstrained optimization is computationally more efficient than constrained optimization .    using an unconstrained optimization based on the above - mentioned quasi - newton method , we calculated the optimal pulses for ising chains of length @xmath96 to @xmath221 . assuming @xmath26 and starting with the initial state @xmath93 , we calculated optimal controls for different values of the target time @xmath46 and time steps @xmath211 , choosing the ghz state @xmath94 as a target state . for chains up to @xmath219 we were able to find",

    "this shows that the transfer times for the optimal controls are much shorter than those for the adiabatic pulses  by about one order of magnitude  and the transfer time appears to be increase linearly with the chain length @xmath6 , at least up to @xmath219 as shown in fig .",

    "this is quite surprising when one considers that the dimension of the smallest invariant subspace @xmath102 that contains the ghz state @xmath94 increases exponentially in @xmath6 .",

    "this behavior can be explained in terms of the subspace coupling induced by the interaction hamiltonian @xmath10 .",
    "for the dynamics restricted to the subspace @xmath102 , @xmath10 couples each eigenspace of @xmath8 only with its first and second neighbor , i.e. , the ground state manifold is directly coupled only to the first and second excited state manifold , and so forth .",
    "therefore population can not be directly transferred from e.g. , @xmath239 to @xmath240 , but must pass through several intermediate levels .",

    "if the system starts in the state @xmath93 or a state close to it , all of these eigenspaces are initially populated .",
    "this does not fully explain the behavior of the optimized dynamics as there are many different excitation pathways and optimal control attempts to maximize constructive interference between all different paths leading to the desired outcome , but it suggests an alternative explanation for the apparently linear dependence of the minimum transfer time on @xmath6 , at least for chains up to length @xmath219 , despite the exponential increase in the dimension of @xmath102 from @xmath241 for @xmath96 to @xmath242 for @xmath219 .",

    "there are always fluctuations in the spin coupling which make the chain disordered . to assess the effect of such inhomogeneity we consider the case where the couplings between neighboring sites are randomly perturbed around the average value @xmath9 @xmath263 where @xmath264 $ ] is a random variable with uniform distribution around zero .",
    "since the random couplings are not known we can only study their average effect over entanglement generation .",

    "lyapunov and optimal control pulses on the other hand rely on dynamic and interference effects to achieve faster transfer , and the temporal shape of the optimal pulse is thus more strongly dependent on the form of the hamiltonian including the coupling strength .",
    "thus , the optimal control pulses are more susceptible to disorder although the optimal control pulses appear to outperform adiabatic control for fluctuations up to @xmath268 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the more efficient control pulses obtained from global optimization techniques are more susceptible than their less effective lyapunov control cousins .",
    "again , the performance of optimal control schemes can be significantly improved if the actual couplings can be estimated more accurately using system identification techniques  @xcite or closed - loop adaptive strategies  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , when accurate estimation of the couplings is infeasible or impossible , e.g. , because we wish to control an ensemble of systems with slightly different couplings , the performance of optimal pulses can ( sometimes ) be improved by optimizing ensemble averages for a collection of systems as in @xcite , although this may not be feasible for systems with more than a few spins as optimizing over a collection of systems is computationally expensive , with each function evaluation requiring the numerical solution of the time - dependent schrodinger equation for many systems .     in terms of @xmath266 , the strength of disorder .",
    "the target time was @xmath269 for adiabatic passage and @xmath270 for lyapunov and optimal control . ]",
    "another major problem in practice is that it is impossible to isolate the system from its environment .",
    "any interaction with environment tends to disturb the evolution of the system .",
    "the precise effect of the environment clearly depends on the type of interaction .",
    "we shall assume that the system - environment interaction is weak and markovian and modelled by a lindblad equation @xmath271 + \\ll(\\rho(t)),\\ ] ] where @xmath272 corresponds to dissipative effects and @xmath195 is the density matrix of the system .",
    "we shall focus here on dephasing , which destroys the coherence of the system , as it is common for many physical systems and the typical dephasing times for most physical systems are much shorter than other relaxation rates .    to assess the effect of decoherence we solve the lindblad equation using the appropriate adiabatic or optimized pulse @xmath11 obtained for the noiseless system . for a dephasing noise",
    "we consider the specific model @xmath273 which corresponds to localized dephasing of individual spins .",
    "[ fig : dic_compare ] shows the fidelity achieved as a function of noise strength @xmath274 for all methods .",
    "as expected , the fidelity decays as the noise strength increases for all strategies but adiabatic passage is substantially more susceptible to the dephasing noise of the form considered .",
    "this is mainly due to the times involved : the transfer times for the adiabatic pulses tend to be about one order of magnitude greater than those for the optimal pulses , giving dephasing more time to act and destroy the coherence .",
    "optimal control is more robust , and theoretically , it may be possible to improve the performance of optimal control by taking decoherence effects into account in the optimization progress , although this is computationally demanding as it require full density matrix optimzation for a density matrix of hilbert space of dimension @xmath117 , as opposed to pure - state optimization on a subspace , which can be done far more efficiently .    .",
    "the longer pulses required for adiabatic passage leave it more susceptible to dephasing .",

    "we have studied ising chains subject to a single a global control such as a magnetic field in the @xmath14-direction with regard to preparing them in an entangled ghz state . due to the existence of multiple symmetries",
    "the system is not controllable , and the hilbert space decomposes into subspaces of varying dimensions that are invariant under the dynamics .",
    "our analysis further shows that even on the invariant subspaces the dynamics is not controllable for all but the smallest subspaces for @xmath118 , and that the ghz state of interest always lies in one of the largest invariant subspaces on which the dynamics is not controllable except for @xmath275 .",
    "nonetheless the ghz state is ( asymptotically ) reachable from an easy - to - prepare initial state by adiabatic passage , and under certain conditions finite - time reachability from a product state such as @xmath276 can be inferred for chains of arbitrary length @xmath6 .",
    "motivated by this positive reachability result , three different control strategies ",
    "adiabatic control , lyapunov control and optimal control  were considered to prepare a ghz state , and their advantages and disadvantages discussed , serving as a reference for future experimental implementations .",
    "each method has its own advantages and disadvantages . broadly speaking lyapunov control",
    "is a simple form of optimal control design , which produces pulses that are simple and quite effective for short chains but the method struggles for longer chains , and for @xmath277 both adiabatic and global optimal control seem to be generally superior . in terms of the total time required to prepare a ghz state with high fidelity for a given chain of length @xmath6",
    ", the control pulses found by global optimal control proved the most efficient , with the time required being up to an order of magnitude less than the time - scale for adiabatic transfer .",
    "the short pulse durations also confer greater robustness in the presence of local spin dephasing compared to the adiabatic transfer scheme , and the optimal control pulses appear slightly more robust with regard to finite temperature effects .",
    "the adiabatic transfer scheme , on the other hand , is more robust with regard to system inhomogeneity such as unknown fluctuations in the @xmath9-coupling between spins .",
    "this is to be expected considering that small system perturbations do not change the ground state of the system appreciably , while such perturbations can alter the interference between different excitation pathways that optimal control designs aim to exploit .",
    "the performance of the latter can be improved by system identification or closed - loop adaptive strategies , and in some cases by explicitly taking inhomogeneity or decoherence into account in the optimization .",
    "both the adiabatic pulse and the lyapunov pulse have analytic expressions , and especially for the adiabatic control , we can choose the form of the slowly varying pulse without solving the dynamical equation .",
    "it is interesting in this regard to note that although a linearly decreasing field would appear to be the simplest choice for adiabatic control , simulations and analysis suggest that a field of the form @xmath278 is generally preferable , resulting in both faster transfer and increased robustness .",
    "while the pulse shapes of the optimal pulses are rather random and more complex than the corresponding adiabatic control fields , the amplitude range and spectral bandwidth of the pulses are quite narrow , and certainly appear to be within experimentally accessible limits .",
    "one major drawback of optimal control is that , unlike for the adiabatic and lyapunov control designs , there are no explicit expressions for the optimal pulse .",
    "instead the pulse must be computed by numerically , and the complexity and computational overhead of calculating the optimal pulses increases rapidly with the length of the chain . although the dynamics can be restricted to a subspace , unfortunately , the ghz state of interest belongs to one of the largest invariant subspaces @xmath102 , whose dimension increases exponentially in @xmath6 with @xmath279 for large @xmath6 , which substantially increases the computational complexity .",
    "surprisingly , despite this exponential increase of the subspace dimension , the minimum time required to prepare a ghz state given an initial product state such as @xmath276 using optimal control appears to be actually linear in @xmath6 . such fast production of a multi - spin ghz ( or cat or noon ) state using a minimal global field on an ising chain will be highly valuable in the fields of enhanced sensing and quantum information technology .",
