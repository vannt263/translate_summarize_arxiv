    "recent developments in the field of cold atomic gases have proven that this system provides an ideal laboratory for the studies of quantum many - body systems@xcite .",
    "this is due to the experimental facilities which allow to control various parameters characterizing the many - body system , e.g. , external potentials including optical lattices , choice of atoms obeying bose or fermi statistics and their mixtures , variable particle densities , etc .",
    "the use of feshbach resonances , in particular , makes the atomic gases an extremely flexible system as it provides a means to control atomic interactions@xcite .",
    "one thus was , for instance , able to study the bec - bcs crossover process in the two - component fermi system , which has been under intense investigation for decades@xcite . by changing the resonance energies through the external magnetic field",
    ", one can in principle change the magnitude and the sign of the scattering length of the interacting particles , keeping track all the way from a resonating fermion pair to a bound composite particle , a bosonic molecule .",
    "the aim of the present paper is the study of pair correlations in a different system , a bose - fermi(bf ) mixture .",
    "degenerate mixtures of bosons and fermions have been created since several years , and studies of static and dynamic properties have been performed@xcite . among those are the studies of attractively interacting bf systems , where one finds a sudden loss of fermions as the bf attractive interaction is effectively increased@xcite .",
    "detailed studies of the dynamics of this system are still missing , however .",
    "recently the finding of feshbach resonances and formation of the boson - fermion molecules have been reported@xcite .",
    "it is thus expected that by controling the bf interaction one may realize an analog of the process found in two - component fermi systems .",
    "what should be expected if one replaced fermion pairs in the bec - bcs crossover process by bf pairs ?",
    "such studies have indeed been performed theoretically@xcite ( see also @xcite . ) by adopting a cooper type two - particle problem on top of the boson - fermion degenerate system , it was shown that a stable correlated bf pair is created even before the threshold for the bf bound state .",
    "in contrast to the bcs case , however , the system allows only one correlated bf pair with a given center - of - mass ( cm ) momentum because of the fermionic nature of the composite particle .",
    "it is then suggested that by increasing the bf attractive interaction , one may create bf pairs with different cm momentum stepwise , until finally a new fermi sea of the bf pairs is completed .    in ref.@xcite",
    "a separable bf interaction has been adopted to elucidate the mechanism of the creation of bf pairs . in the present paper",
    "we adopt a standard pseudopotential for the interaction , and calculate energy and pressure of the system for various values of input parameters .",
    "we use green s function formalism for this system and calculate perturbatively relevant diagrams to lowest order of the hole - line expansion .",
    "such formalism has been developed in @xcite together with the calculation of the energies including bose - bose ( bb ) interaction .",
    "our formulation is similar to @xcite , but we use the renormalization procedure of @xcite in relating the pseudopotential strength to the @xmath3-wave scattering length .",
    "this allows us to formally take the limit @xmath4 , the unitarity limit @xcite , which is necessary when one considers a ( nearly ) bound state of a pair of atoms .",
    "we then calculate the poles of the bf pair scattering amplitude in the bf medium , which may be compared with the results of @xcite .",
    "studies of the behavior of the poles as a function of input parameters give us suggestions on the role of the bf pair correlations in the static properties of the system .",
    "the content of the paper is as follows : in the next section we present our model based on the hamiltonian without bose - bose interaction .",
    "we calculate the bf scattering amplitude in the bf mixture in ladder approximation , and give formulas for physical quantities in terms of the amplitude . in section 3",
    "we show numerical results for the ground state energy and pressure for various choices of the boson / fermion masses and the values of the bose - fermi interaction .",
    "we then study bose - fermi pair correlation in section 4 by focusing on the pole structure of the boson - fermion scattering amplitude in the mixture .",
    "we also calculate the pole of the single fermion green s function and study the role of the bose - fermi pair and its dispersion .",
    "we summarize our results in section 5 together with a comment on the effects of the bose - bose interaction .",
    "detailed expressions for the scattering amplitude are given in the appendix .",
    "we consider a uniform system of a polarized bose - fermi mixture of atomic gases with attractive boson - fermion interaction .",

    "effects of the boson - boson interaction will be mentioned later , while the fermion - fermion interaction is omitted throughout as we consider one - component ( polarized ) fermions .",

    "the two formulations are , however , essentially equivalent . from the structure of eq.([eq : temp1 ] ) , one easily finds that @xmath51 depends only on the variable @xmath53 , and we hereafter write simply @xmath64 .",
    "one also finds that the integral in eq.([eq : temp1 ] ) requires a momentum cutoff , which originates from the use of the zero - range interaction .",
    "we can remedy this shortcoming by employing the observable s - wave scattering length @xmath65 , instead of the pseudopotential coupling constant @xmath50 .",

    "if a similar phenomenon is expected or not for bose - fermi pairs will be studied in the next section .    using above vertex function",
    ", we can calculate the proper self - energies for the fermion and the boson as @xmath75 expression ( [ eq : temp1 ] ) implies that @xmath76 is analytic in the upper half @xmath77 plane , and eq.([eq : bstemp ] ) reduces to @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",
    "this shows that @xmath80 , and hence , also @xmath81 is analytic in the upper half @xmath82 plane .",

    "we calculate the energy of the system in the leading order of the hole - line expansion , that is we replace green s functions in eq.([eq : ene_exp ] ) with the free one @xmath84 in eq.([eq : freegf ] ) , and obtain    @xmath85    where , @xmath86 and @xmath87 is the fermi energy . within the same approximations , the thermodynamic potential at zero temperature",
    "is given by @xmath88 thus , the equilibrium condition ( [ eq : bnum ] ) for @xmath89 leads to the integral equation for @xmath12 , @xmath90 where @xmath51 depends also on @xmath12 .",
    "the total energy of the system is then finally given by @xmath91 details of the calculation and the analytic expression for @xmath51 are given in the appendix .",
    "we may rewrite eq.([eq : chemdet ] ) in a scaled form as @xmath92 where we introduced tilde ( dimensionless ) quantities through @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "the expression shows that the scaled chemical potential @xmath97 depends only on the mass ratio @xmath98 and the dimensionless scattering length @xmath94 .",
    "we solved eq.([eq : iona ] ) for @xmath97 numerically as a function of the boson - fermion mass ratio @xmath99 for different values of the interaction strength represented by @xmath100 . in terms of the scaled quantities ,",
    "the ground state energy per particle is expressed from eq.([eq : intene ] ) as @xmath101 where the dimensionless parameter @xmath102 is given by @xmath103    we first show the results for energy and pressure in the unitarity limit , @xmath74 . in this limit , assuming s - wave scattering and neglecting effective range , we are left with only one length scale , @xmath104 , or @xmath105 in terms of the density @xmath106 @xcite for a given mass ratio @xmath99 .",
    "note that the chemical potential @xmath97 has no @xmath57 dependence in the unitarity limit , and the parameter @xmath102 depends only on the number ratio @xmath1 .",
    "thus the ground state energy per particle , eq.([eq : aa ] ) , is proportional to @xmath87 , and the dependence on the parameters are all absorbed in a simple multiplicative factor @xmath107 .",
    "we show in fig.[fig : chem ] the chemical potential @xmath12 and in fig.[fig : graene ] the beta parameter as functions of the mass ratio @xmath98 , both in the unitarity limit .",
    "note that the results are independent of the magnitude of the individual mass parameters as we show dimensionless quantities scaled with @xmath87 .",
    "figure [ fig : chem ] shows that the boson chemical potential is always negative .",
    "this fact reflects the attractive boson - fermion interaction in the unitarity limit , in accordance with eq.([eq : renorm ] ) which implies negative @xmath50 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath102 in fig.[fig : graene ] simply follows the one of the chemical potential .",
    "the results suggest that the attractive interaction becomes more effective for small values of the mass ratio @xmath99 , and the effect is greatly enhanced as the particle number ratio @xmath1 becomes larger , that is as the number of bosons increases with respect to the fermions .",
    "the dependence on @xmath99 may partly be understood by noting that the relative phase space available for the intermediate states in the two - body scattering in the mixture will be larger for small @xmath99 , i.e. , for a relatively larger @xmath108 , because of the lower fermi energy and higher level density .",
    "we next consider the pressure to study the stability of the system .",
    "since the total energy takes a universal form and the @xmath102 parameter has no volume dependence in the unitarity limit , the pressure is simply given by @xmath109 for @xmath110 the pressure becomes negative , and the system collapses .",
    "this happens especially for larger values of @xmath1 , where the pressure becomes always negative irrespective of the mass ratio @xmath99 . in actual experiments , e.g. , for the @xmath111k-@xmath112rb mixture which has @xmath113",
    ", the number ratio is typically @xmath114 and the system would collapse in the unitarity limit .",
    "this is not in contradiction to recent experimental results @xcite .",
    "another feature in the unitarity limit seen from fig.[fig : chem ] and fig.[fig : graene ] is that the boson chemical potential and the ground state energy saturate when the mass ratio becomes large .",
    "it is natural that the bosonic degree of freedom gets frozen and a universal fermionic description appears in this case , since the fermionic effects on the bosons would become negligible , and the bosons would act as a static external field for fermions .",
    "this behavior at large @xmath99 also has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "we now study the case with an arbitrary value of the scattering length .",
    "first , we show the chemical potential @xmath12 as a function of @xmath115 in fig.[fig : chem_a ] , where the mass ratio @xmath99 and @xmath1 are set to 1 .",
    "then , we show the energy and pressure as a function of @xmath115 in figs.[fig : energy_pressure_m08 ] , [ fig : energy_pressure_m10 ] and [ fig : energy_pressure_m12 ] , for the mass ratio @xmath116 with different values of @xmath117 . for @xmath118 ,",
    "the pressure is given by    @xmath119 ,          \\label{eq : press_general_a}\\ ] ]    where the term dependent on @xmath120 reflects that the chemical potential , and hence the @xmath102 parameter , depends on @xmath121 .",
    "from the results on energies we see that the system becomes more attractive at smaller values of the mass ratio @xmath99 as in the unitarity limit , although the effect is not large in this parameter range .",
    "we find a strong increase of the attraction as the parameter @xmath115 passes through zero , the unitarity limit , from negative to positive .",
    "this is in accord with a naive picture where the positive values of the scattering length imply a newly formed bound state .",
    "one should however note that even in the present approximation the effects of the medium modify the two - body scattering amplitude , and a simple picture of independent bound pairs does not hold in general .",
    "turning now to the pressure , a comparison of eq.([eq : press_general_a ] ) with the corresponding expression ( [ eq : pre ] ) in the unitarity limit shows that the strong attraction for @xmath122 comes from the large negative values of @xmath51 as well as from the coherence of the two terms in the integrand .",
    "results of the previous section indicate that the strong attraction in the mixture will show up especially for positive @xmath65 , which may eventually lead to a collapse of the system .",
    "we now consider another scenario for the attractively interacting mixture , the possibility of a bose - fermi pair formation@xcite . for this purpose",
    "we study in this section the behavior of the pole of the bose - fermi scattering amplitude @xmath64 in the mixture .    in unpolarized ( or two - component ) fermi systems ,",
    "an infinitesimal attraction around the fermi surface leads to formation of cooper pairs with a center - of - mass ( cm ) momentum @xmath123 , causing a transition to the bcs state . in a bose - fermi mixture ,",
    "on the other hand , the difference in the momentum distribution of the two particles and the fermionic character of the bose - fermi pair , in particular , predict quite a different scenario for the formation of the pairs in the mixture .",
    "it requires consideration of the balance of the kinetic energies of different kinds of particles and the magnitude of the attractive interaction .",
    "let us give a brief picture on the formation of bose - fermi pairs in the mixture .",
    "following the idea of @xcite , we may take a bose - fermi mixture with @xmath124 , focusing only one pair of a boson and a fermion with cm momentum @xmath125 , putting other particles as a free background .",
    "the hamiltonian in this system may be written as @xmath126 where we explicitly write the kinetic energy and the interaction for the two particles , while the background hamiltonian @xmath127 acts only to impose a pauli - principle constraint .",
    "we neglect here the effect of the boson chemical potential for simplicity .",
    "if the effect of @xmath128 on the pair were negligible , the energy of the bose - fermi pair with cm momentum @xmath125 would be simply @xmath129 which has been called _ free branch _ in @xcite , since the boson will remain at @xmath130 in the condensate .",
    "when the effect of the interaction becomes important , one may rewrite eq.([eq : model_h ] ) as @xmath131 where the interaction @xmath128 is contained in the hamiltonian @xmath132 of the relative motion . by replacing the latter with its eigenvalue @xmath133 ( the effect of the medium",
    "may be included here ) , one obtains a different dispersion curve for the bose - fermi pair , the _ collective branch _ ,",
    "which is given by @xmath134 the calculation for the model with a separable interaction in @xcite shows that the two dispersion curves , eqs.([eq : eps_free ] ) and ( [ eq : eps_coll ] ) , coexist except for the region of cm momentum @xmath135 given by a solution of the equation @xmath136 there is a mixture of the two branches around @xmath137 , and the dispersion curve of the pair deviates from @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "for a sufficiently attractive interaction , the solution of eq.([eq : pcross ] ) satisfies the condition @xmath140 , which occurs for @xmath141 one may thus expect that the system will lower the energy by converting the free bose - fermi particles in the range @xmath142 into _ collective _ pairs .",
    "( note that we neglect the interaction of the pairs in this simple argument . )",
    "if @xmath128 is so strong as to allow for a bound state of the pair , i.e. , @xmath143 , all the free bosons and fermions would be replaced with the bound b - f pairs , and the new fermi sea of the pairs will be formed .",
    "this picture may be modified even in this simple model , however , for a system with many bose - fermi pairs .",
    "as the pairs can occupy low - momentum states having lower energies without changing the total momentum of the system , the formation of the collective pairs may start if the condition @xmath144 is satisfied , even before the condition ( [ ed : cond_cross ] ) .",
    "similarly , the formation of the fermi sea of the pair will be completed only when @xmath145 is satisfied .",
    "we note that the collective branch ( [ eq : eps_coll ] ) may suffer a laudau type damping for sufficiently large @xmath133 .",
    "this is because the free bose - fermi mixture with fermi momentum @xmath57 has a continuum of the boson - fermion excitation with momentum @xmath146 which starts at the energy @xcite",
    "@xmath147 this implies that the collective branch remains undamped only when @xmath148 a condition which is approximately realized for the pole of the boson - fermion scattering amplitude as shown below .",
    "now we study the behavior of the pole of @xmath64 .",
    "a first study concerns the pole condition .",
    "that is @xmath149 for @xmath150 , we show in fig.[fig : i_by_p_zero ] the right hand side of ( [ eq : pole_condition ] ) as a function of @xmath151 for @xmath152 .",
    "we see the development of a logarithmic divergency as @xmath151 aproaches @xmath153 .",
    "this stems from the fact that above dispersion integral has exactly the same structure as the one encountered in the problem of cooper for a fermion pair in a fermi - sea .",
    "we want , however , to point out that the pole corresponds to a composite fermion what has important consequences for the physics .",
    "nevertheless the fact is there that a stable collective b - f pair developes for any infinitesimal attraction , i.e , even in the limit @xmath154 quite in analogy to the original cooper pole @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss the collective pole contained in @xmath64 .",
    "be @xmath155 the pole of @xmath64 with cm momentum @xmath156 .",
    "@xmath157 represents the total energy of a boson - fermion pair corresponding to the _ collective branch _ aside from the chemical potential .",
    "one may then define a @xmath158-dependent binding energy ( including total kinetic energy ) measured from the last filled free bose - fermi pair by @xmath159 see fig.[fig : pairing ] .",
    "positive value of @xmath160 would signal a formation of the bose - fermi pair .    .",
    "the dots represent a boson ( left ) and a fermion(right ) .",
    "the shaded box indicates a fermi sphere . ]",
    "we solved @xmath157 numerically . here",
    "we include chemical potential @xmath12 , and show @xmath160 in units of @xmath87 for @xmath116 in figs.[fig : delta_pair_m08 ] , [ fig : delta_pair_m10 ] and [ fig : delta_pair_m12 ] .",
    "the number ratio is fixed at @xmath161 . left panel of each figure shows results for several values of @xmath162 .",
    "one finds that each line extends up to a maximum value of @xmath158 , the energy of which corresponds to @xmath163 in eq.([eq : eps_th ] ) , i.e. , the point where the pole hits the continuum and obtains a finite lifetime due to the non - vanishing imaginary part . in the right panels of these figures",
    ", we show the dispersion curves at the threshold values of @xmath162 , where @xmath160 turns from negative to positive for the first time .",
    "we see from these figures that the effective binding increases as the interaction becomes more attractive , and eventually leads to a formation of the bose - fermi pair . the threshold value of @xmath162 is lower for a smaller value of @xmath98 in agreement with the result for the total energy .",
    "we find also that @xmath164 is always negative in the unitarity limit , suggesting that the bose - fermi pair may not be formed in this limit .",
    "a peculiar feature seen from the figures is the non - monotonic dependence of @xmath164 against cm momentum @xmath158 , which is in contrast to the @xmath165 dependence of eq.([eq : eps_coll ] ) in the simple picture .",
    "this is particularly apparent for small values of @xmath98 .",
    "missing in the simple model is the @xmath53-dependence of the pair binding energy @xmath133 which should be present due , e.g. , to the phase space available for the two - body scattering in medium . the medium effect becomes stronger for larger ( positive ) values of @xmath115 , especially for small @xmath99 as seen from the figure .",
    "it may be mentioned in addition , that the results in the next subsection suggest a strong interplay of the collective and free branches for the fermion dispersion relation .",
    "let us now investigate the pole structure of the single particle green s function @xmath166 of ( [ eq : gfermi ] ) .",
    "the pole condition reads , @xmath167 in order to be consistent with our publication in @xcite , we here neglect the chemical potential @xmath12 in @xmath64 of ( [ eq : gammap ] ) .",
    "this means that we replace in @xmath64 the boson and fermion propagators by totally free ones with the kinetic energies of boson and fermion and @xmath168 which is the uncorrelated value .    with the definition of @xmath169 in ( [ eq : gfermi ] ) with @xmath168 and the expression @xmath51 of ( [ eq : gammap ] )",
    ", we easily can investigate the poles of @xmath166 for various system parameters .",
    "we first consider cases , like in @xcite , where @xmath170 .",
    "we expect two branches : one which corresponds in week coupling to @xmath171 and one which corresponds to the collective branch , i.e. the pole contained in @xmath172 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in fig.[fig : fermi_disp_two ] , we show on the left panel the case of @xmath173 and on the right panel the case of @xmath174 . from top to botom , we have @xmath175 . here mass ratio @xmath152 . the dotted area is the region where the imaginary part of @xmath169 is different from zero . as in our ealier work @xcite , we see an avoided crossing of the two branches at some finite value of @xmath176 .",
    "we also see that the interaction between the two branches becomes stronger as @xmath1 increases .    in fig.[fig",
    ": fdisp_a05 ] , we show the case @xmath177 and @xmath178 for left panel and @xmath161 for right panel .",
    "we see that no crossing feature is visible any longer and the two branches probably become completely hybridised . in a future publication",
    "we intend to investigate in a systematic way the nature of the two branches as a function of the system parameters .",
    "we studied in this paper the static properties of the bose - fermi mixture in the lowest order of the hole - line expansion , i.e. in the t - matrix approximation .",
    "the interaction parameter is expressed in terms of the scattering length up to infinite order using the renormalization procedure of ref.@xcite , so as to allow for the calculation around the unitarity limit .",
    "the t - matrix approach is a common approximation often used in the past in fermi and bose systems @xcite .",
    "it has , however , not been investigated very much in bose - fermi mixtures and , therefore , one has not much experience about its quality in that situation",
    ". recently appeared , however , a study for a one dimensional system @xcite , from where exact quantum monte carlo results are available for comparison . in ref",
    "@xcite it is shown that the t - matrix approach yields quite reasonable results also in the bose - fermi case , even in a one dimensional case which is probably the worst situation possible .    with this background in mind , we first studied energy and pressure as functions of the inverse scattering length for several choices of the mass ratio @xmath98 and the number ratio @xmath1 .",
    "the energy of the system becomes strongly attractive as the inverse scattering length changes sign from negative to positive , i.e. around the unitary limit .",
    "as one increases the number of bosons with respect to the fermions , arrives a point where the pressure becomes negative , i.e. the system becomes unstable ( collapse ) .",
    "the effect is stronger for small values of @xmath0 .",
    "this is not in contradiction with experiments @xcite .",
    "next we studied the possibility of stable bf - pairs , as in @xcite .",
    "we , indeed , also found in the present model that even for infinitesimal bf - attraction a stable bf - mode appears , reminiscent of the cooper pole in a two component fermi gas , since in both cases its origin stems from the presence of a sharp fermi surface .",
    "however , in the bf case the bf - pair is a composite fermion , whereas in the original cooper problem , one has a composite fermion pair , i.e. a boson - like cluster . in the latter case , many pairs can well be treated by the usual bcs formalism . on the other hand ,",
    "the case of many bf - pairs still has to be worked out .",
    "this shall be done in future work .",
    "but we here studied the bf pair formation by observing its binding energy measured from the last filled free bf pair . for some finite values of the attractive interaction , there occurs the formation of stable bf pairs .",
    "for @xmath179 the pair shows a standard dispersion of a quasiparticle , while for @xmath180 the pair with finite center - of - mass momenta feel stronger attraction .",
    "this effect is not clearly seen in the energy or pressure , where the singular effect may have been averaged out .    up to this point we assumed an ideal case where the bose - fermi interaction is dominant , while the bose - bose interaction was neglected . to compare with a real atomic gas system",
    ", the bose - bose interaction can not be discarded even when the bose - fermi interaction is enhanced , e.g. , through feshbach resonances .",
    "we checked the effect of the bose - bose interaction on the energy of the system up to the first order in @xmath181 .",
    "we took the bosebose scattering length @xmath182 in the range @xmath183 , and the number ratio @xmath1842.0 , 1.0 and 0.5 , and repeated the calculation of the @xmath102 parameter and the pressure @xcite .",
    "the calculation shows that the effect of the bose - bose interaction is small within the adopted parameter values : the @xmath102 value at the unitarity limit , for instance , deviates less than 10% for @xmath185 and @xmath124 , and does not change conclusions obtained at @xmath186 .    in summary , we suggest that the energy gain in the bose - fermi mixture at positive values of @xmath187 is related to the formation of the resonant bose - fermi pairs , and that the center - of - mass momenta of the pairs are dependent on the ratio @xmath0 due to the statistics of the two kinds of the particles .",
    "we thank x. barillier - pertuisel , k. suziki , t. nishimura , t. maruyama and h. yabu for useful discussions .",
    "we also thank j. dukelsky and s. pittel for their general interest and contributions to the subject of bf correlations .",
    "let us calculate the @xmath188 ( [ eq : gammap ] ) of the scattering amplitude @xmath64      as we are interested in the real part of the pole of @xmath64 , we hereafter omit @xmath190 in the denominator . each term in the integrand shows an ultraviolet divergence , and we formally introduce a cutoff @xmath191 which will be taken to infinity later .",
