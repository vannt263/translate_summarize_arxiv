    "to understand the connection between long - duration gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) and the supernovae ( sne ) associated with them , it would be significant to detect the effects of jets that are produced in the explosion even when the observer is not in the relativistic beam @xcite ) . in the broad - lined type ic , sn 2003jd ,",
    "an off - axis grb jet was proposed as the cause for the double - peaked oxygen profile observed in its nebular spectrum @xcite . a similar double - peaked oxygen profile , with a large blueshift ,",
    "was detected in the peculiar type ib , sn 2005bf @xcite , where it was interpreted as coming from a unipolar blob or jet @xcite .",
    "if the double - peaked oxygen shape were exclusively caused by highly relativistic jets , then we might expect only broad - lined sn ic , whose line widths approach 30,000 @xmath0 , and which are the only subtype of stripped - envelope sn seen at the sites of grbs to exhibit them .",
    "however , if we see double - peaked profiles in a range of supernova types , we might conclude that asphericities are present in more typical core - collapse events .",
    "we set out to obtain a set of nebular spectra for supernovae of various subtypes to measure the emission line profiles with adequate resolution and signal to detect signs of these double - peaked profiles in nebular spectra of supernovae .",

    "for most sn in our sample , the trough between the two `` horns '' is located at nearly zero velocity for [ ] 6300 .",

    "could the observed double - peaked profile be due to optical depth effects ? the [ ]  @xmath16300,6363  doublet has a velocity separation of 3000 @xmath0(with respect to 6300  ) and an intensity ratio of 3:1 in the optically thin limit .",

    "[ sn04aoratio_fig ] ) .    in sn 2004ao , where we have sufficiently high s / n- data",
    ", we also see a similar double - peaked profile in the permitted  @xmath27774  line and in [  @xmath6 which are not doublets , as shown in fig .",
    "[ doubleoxy_fig ] .",
    "this suggests that the line shapes really do provide a guide to the distribution of oxygen and magnesium in the ejecta .",
    "optical depth is not the probable cause for seeing two equal peaks in the [ ]  @xmath16300,6363  line profile .",
    "@xmath26300  and [ ]  @xmath26363 the intensity ratio would increase over time , as observed in sn  1987a ( empty circles , from @xcite ) and 1988a @xcite . ]",
    "we suggest a torus - like structure for either the oxygen distribution or for the radioactive energy source that excites the oxygen lines , @xmath10co  @xcite . if the distribution of the energy source were most important , we would expect to see a double - peaked profile for all the emission lines , including calcium .",
    "since the double - peaked lines are seen only for oxygen and magnesium , the evidence favors the view that we are seeing the effects of the distribution of those elements in velocity space .",
    "models of the line shape that results from an expanding disk are worked out by , e.g. , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "comprehensive modeling of the line profiles needs to take into account viewing angle effects and the thickness of the line - emitting and expanding region .",
    "we leave that as a topic for future work .    here",
    "we do not attempt to explain the extreme blueshift ( @xmath7 2000 @xmath0 ) seen in sn  2005bf  at epochs later than 200 days .",
    "the less extreme blueshifts seen in spectra obtained at @xmath11 200 days for one of our sn ( sn  2004ao ) might be caused by the same mechanism that is responsible for the observed blueshifts in sn that show a single - peak line of [ ]  @xmath16300,6363 .",
    "s. taubenberger at al .",
    "( in preparation ) observe in a large set of late - time spectra of 34 sn ib and sn ic that the oxygen line centroids are found to be blueshifted for spectra taken at @xmath12 200 days .",
    "these blueshifts range up to @xmath71500 @xmath0  for spectra at @xmath1390 days and go to zero with increasing time .",
    "taubenberger et al .",
    "exclude dust formation , contamination from oth er lines and geometric effects as potential causes and invoke residual opacity effects as the most likely reason .",
    "the observed blueshift - values in our sample agree with those seen in taubenberger et al . for similar epochs ; thus , the same mechanism might be causing the blueshifts in both single- and double - peaked [ ]  @xmath16300,6363 .",
    "we encourage future detailed modeling of the radiative transfer of [ ]  @xmath16300,6363  to elucidate the exact reason for the blueshift .",
    "we do not have a simple explanation for the redshift seen in the trough of the double - peaked [ ]  @xmath16300,6363  of sn  1984l .",
    "we conclude that the most probable explanation for the double - horned oxygen profiles is a torus like , or at least flattened , distribution of oxygen , that may be a relic of the explosion physics .",
    "energy deposition and radiation transport modeling of late - time emission in sn ib ( @xcite ) predicts that material contributing to [ ]  @xmath16300,6363  ( and to [  @xmath6 ) emission is situated further out in the ejecta than material emitting in [ ]  @xmath17291,7324  ( see their fig . 8) . we speculate that the mechanism causing the asphericities has to affect the outer layers of the sn debris more than the inner ones .",
    "the anisotropies we observe in the oxygen lines suggest large - scale plumes of mixing rather than the small - scale inhomogeneities invoked to explain sub - structure of the oxygen lines as reported for sne ii 1979c , 1980k ( @xcite and references therein ) , in sn iib 1993j @xcite and in sn ib / c  1985f @xcite . in the case of our observed sn ,",
    "the anisotropies may be of global nature in order to give rise to such a clear double - peaked line profiles .",
    "alternatively , in case the supernova progenitors are part of binaries , binary interaction or merger might be modulating the geometry of the supernova ejecta @xcite .",
    "such a clear signature of a pure double - peaked oxygen profile has not been found in other sn ib / c @xcite , except in sn  2003jd @xcite and in sn  2005bf .",
    "sn  2003jd was a broad - lined sn ic without an observed grb and showed the same double - peaked oxygen profile @xcite as sn  2004ao ( compare their fig .",
    "2 with our fig .  [ doubleoxy_fig ] ) .",
    "@xcite interpret their observations as indicating an aspherical axisymmetric explosion viewed from near the equatorial plane , and suggest that this asphericity was caused by an off - axis grb jet .",
    "they conclude that only special sn , those with high expansion velocities and possibly connected with grbs , are aspherical , and use sn  2003jd as a link between the normal , spherical sn ic and those highly aspherical ones connected with grbs . in our sample",
    ", however , the sn showing these line profiles are normal sn ib and even sn iib , i.e. sn from stars with intact helium and partial h envelopes before explosion , and have normal early - time expansion velocities .",
    "thus , it appears that asphericities are prevalent in normal core - collapse events .",
    "indeed , complex and ring - like velocity structures of oxygen have been observed in sn remnants ( snrs ) , most prominently in the oxygen - rich snr  1e0102.2@xmath87219  in the small magellanic cloud @xcite .",
    "@xcite and subsequent papers fit a twisted ring model to the spatial and velocity extent of the filaments that extents to velocities ranging between @xmath82500 to @xmath14 4000 @xmath0 .",
    "it is conceivable that the stellar death leading to snr  1e0102.2@xmath87219  had a geometry for the ejecta that was similar to the events we observe .",
    "asphericities may be common in in core - collapse events , be they neutrino - driven @xcite , acoustic @xcite , or magneto driven @xcite , as indicated by polarization , neutron star kick velocities and the morphologies of young remnants .",
    "recently , @xcite also reported that double - peaked line profiles are not rare in stripped core - collapse sn .",
    "they suggested that the observed fraction of double - peaked profiles ( @xmath15% ) is consistent with the hypothesis that all of these core - collapse events are mildly aspherical .",
    "although their inferences are based on the results of bipolar jet models @xcite , @xcite suggest that a wide variety of geometries , similar to those suggested here , may be present .",
    "in summary , we detect clear double - peaked line profiles of [ ]  @xmath16300,6363  in three sn iib and sn ib / c out of our observed sample of 8  and additionally , in one out of four published sn ib .",
    "our sample does not include broad - lined sn ic or peculiar objects .",
    "these line profiles are probably not caused by optical depth effects , and suggest global anisotropies in the ejecta . prior to this work ,",
    "double - peaked oxygen lines had only been reported in two peculiar sn ib / c and interpreted as off - axis grb - jet or unipolar blob ejections .",
    "it seems more likely that asphericities are present in a wide variety of core - collapse events and they are not strictly confined to the supernovae associated with grb jets .",
    "although special models have been proposed to account for the line profiles in peculiar supernovae , our investigation suggests that double - peaked profiles , and underlying disks , are not unusual .",
    "these ordinary sn from our sample have a variety of subtypes , reflecting the diversity of mass loss prior to the explosion .",
    "we recommend a meta - analysis of available nebular spectra of all core - collapse sn , spanning the full range from sn ii to iib , ib , ic and finally , to broad - lined sn ic , in order to quantify the kinematics and geometry of the ejecta and to seek trends as a function of sn type . further high - sn / n",
