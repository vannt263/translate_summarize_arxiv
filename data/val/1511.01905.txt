    "finally , an efficient mechanism of baryogenesis has been proposed in susy , making use of flat directions @xcite .",
    "the minimal version of the susy standard model ( sm ) , also known as mssm , contains one dimensionful parameter in the superpotential , namely , the @xmath1-term , i.e. , @xmath2 , where the su(2 ) doublets @xmath3 and @xmath4 yield masses to uplike and downlike quarks as they acquire vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) , respectively .",

    "typically a discrete @xmath0 symmetry is imposed under which all chiral superfields @xmath11 transform as @xmath12 .",
    "such a symmetry guarantees the absence of terms like @xmath13 and @xmath14 as well as the @xmath1-term in the mssm .",

    "this symmetry breaking also poses an intriguing problem and a challenge , which leads to the formation of domain walls in the universe .",
    "although domain walls with tiny energy scale may yield some interesting cosmological consequences @xcite including mild acceleration of cosmic expansion @xcite , in the present case , their energy scale is so high that if they persist in the late universe , they simply cause cosmological disasters overdominating the energy density of the universe @xcite .    in the literature , in order to evade this problem , it is usually assumed that the @xmath0 symmetry is an accidental symmetry and there exists some explicit symmetry breaking term , which leads to the collapse of domain walls at late times .",

    "] the purpose of the present paper is to provide an alternative explanation to avoid the domain wall problem in the context of inflationary cosmology rather than an explicit symmetry breaking term employed so far in the literature .",
    "we will see that the formation of domain walls can be alleviated if there exist sufficiently large negative supergravity corrections proportional to the hubble parameter in the effective potential for the singlet scalar field during and after inflation . in nmssm . ]",
    "since the singlet field tracks a time - varying minimum of the effective potential after inflation , we call this scenario the _ tracking mechanism_.    the outline of the paper is as follows : in sec .",

    "[ sec3 ] . in sec .",

    "initial conditions for the singlet field during inflation are also discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] , we take account of finite temperature corrections for the evolution of the singlet field after inflation and obtain some conditions on the higgs - singlet coupling and the reheating temperature in order to avoid the domain wall formation .",
    "the consequences for cosmology in the nmssm are briefly discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec7 ] . finally , sec .",
    "[ sec8 ] is devoted to the conclusion and discussions .",
    "in order to address this issue , let us first note that from @xmath18 , we see that @xmath19 can be much larger than the weak scale if the coupling @xmath9 is sufficiently small . in this case , the scalar potential can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the soft susy breaking mass parameters . would also appear , where @xmath23 , and @xmath24  gev is the reduced planck mass . in this paper",
    "we are ignoring these higher order contributions to the superpotential and the potential . ] from the above form of the potential , we can estimate the vev of @xmath6 at the global minimum as @xmath25 note that the magnitude of @xmath22 must be slightly larger than that of @xmath26 in order to guarantee the existence of the global minimum with @xmath27  @xcite : @xmath28 furthermore , @xmath9 and @xmath10 can not have a large hierarchy if the magnitudes of all dimensionful parameters @xmath1 , @xmath26 , and @xmath22 are close to the weak scale . in this paper , we assume @xmath29 for simplicity .    before discussing the resolution of the problem , let us describe how likely the formation of domain walls occurs in the inflationary context . for simplicity , we assume that inflation is driven by a potential energy of some scalar field , called inflaton , and that the inflaton sector does not embody the @xmath6 superfield , or as a matter of fact other mssm superfields .",
    "a naive expectation is that the domain wall formation is avoidable if the thermal corrections to the effective potential of the singlet scalar remain irrelevant after inflation such that the @xmath0 symmetry is never restored , but this simple observation turns out to be insufficient when we carefully consider the evolution of the singlet scalar during and after inflation due to the reasons discussed below .    during inflation ,",
    "quantum mechanically induced vacuum fluctuations significantly displace any light scalar field whose effective mass is smaller than the hubble parameter @xmath30 because it obtains quantum fluctuations of order @xmath31 within each hubble time  @xcite .",
    "after a sufficiently large number of @xmath32-folds of inflation , a free real scalar field @xmath33 with mass @xmath34 acquires long - wave fluctuations with dispersion @xmath35 the dispersion of a scalar field with a more complicated potential can be calculated by the stochastic inflation method @xcite but the typical field amplitude can be estimated by simply requiring that the typical value of its potential energy density takes a value @xmath36 .",
    "this fact implies that the vev of the @xmath6 field during inflation is generically different from the value @xmath37 ,  eq .",
    ", at the global minimum of the low - energy effective potential because the bare mass of @xmath6 field is @xmath38 . after inflation ,",
    "the @xmath6 field starts to oscillate , reducing its amplitude with time .",
    "it eventually falls into one of the global minima , whose phase is related by the @xmath0 transformation to that of other minima .",
    "note , however , that the final value of the phase of @xmath39 can differ at each spatial point because of the existence of the field fluctuations @xmath40 .",
    "these field variations originate from quantum fluctuations during inflation , and they may be enhanced once the @xmath6 field starts to oscillate due to the parametric resonance effect ; see  @xcite .",
    "the enhancement occurs both in the radial and angular direction of the complex scalar @xmath6 , since the @xmath22 term mixes them . as a result ,",
    "different domains are created within the horizon scale , and domain walls are formed around their boundary .",
    "the above discussion suggests that the formation of domain walls is almost inevitable unless the @xmath6 field is stabilized at the minimum of the effective potential during inflation .",
    "in this paper , we shall argue that the resolution of this problem is also achieved within the inflationary paradigm ( for a recent review of inflation , see , _",
    "e.g. _ ,  @xcite . )",
    "the key ingredient is an effective mass of the form @xmath41 for the @xmath6 field , where @xmath42 is the hubble parameter at a given time .",
    "such a mass term generically arises via a planck - suppressed interaction in the framework of supergravity  @xcite ; see also  @xcite .",
    "since the value of the coefficient @xmath43 depends on the details of the khler terms  @xcite , it is fair to treat it as a free parameter to keep the discussion model independent . according to its value",
    ", we may consider the following three possibilities :    * : in this case , @xmath6 is expected to take a large value @xmath44 during inflation due to the accumulation of long wave quantum fluctuations .",
    "it starts oscillation as the hubble parameter gets smaller than the effective mass of @xmath6 after inflation .",
    "then even in case a motion along the angular direction was suppressed initially , as it crossed the origin , it would start the angular motion and the phase of the scalar field would have a scattered distribution due to the @xmath0 symmetry of the potential . as a result ,",
    "formation of domain walls is inevitable . * : in this case , during inflation the @xmath6 field is stabilized at the origin .",
    "after inflation , it rolls down to the global minimum from the origin when the temperature of the universe becomes sufficiently low ( i.e. , the phase transition occurs ) , and again domain walls are created through the kibble mechanism . * : in this case , during inflation the @xmath6 field takes a value larger than @xmath45 , very similar to our fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . as we will see below",
    ", there is a possibility to avoid the domain wall formation in this case .",
    "indeed if @xmath6 sits on its potential minimum at each time and adiabatically traces its time evolution until the field relaxes to @xmath45 , we may avoid the domain wall formation .     at early times , and",
    "the green solid line represents that at the present time where the hubble - induced term becomes irrelevant .",
    "the location of the minimum varies with time , which is indicated by blue circles.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    from here onwards , we will only consider the last case with a negative hubble - induced mass ( @xmath46 ) to see if the above - mentioned tracking scenario works .",
    "we can write the effective potential for the @xmath6 field during inflation as @xmath47 where terms dependent on @xmath30 are induced by the inflaton s potential through the supergravity effect . here",
    "we have ignored the soft susy breaking contributions , since @xmath48 , and the possible interaction terms with two higgses , since they are stabilized at the origin due to the large field value of @xmath6 .",
    "the cubic term of the form @xmath49 with @xmath50 being another coefficient plays an important role in stabilizing the phase of @xmath6 to the minimum of the potential .",
    "terms dependent on the hubble parameter @xmath51 induced by supergravity effects are present even in the field oscillation regime after inflation : @xmath52 here the coefficients , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , may take somewhat smaller values than @xmath43 and @xmath50 during inflation , respectively , because in this regime the kinetic energy is comparable to the potential energy .",
    "hereafter we assume that all these four parameters are real and positive , and that @xmath55 and @xmath56 for simplicity .",
    "it should be noticed that ( the origins of ) the phases of the @xmath57 terms in eqs .   and   might not be identical if the khler structures responsible for the @xmath57 terms are changed .",
    "since the khler structures remain unchanged during inflation and inflaton oscillation due to the energy dominance of the inflaton field , both phases are expected to coincide . on the other hand , they may change generally after the inflaton decays and radiation dominates the energy density of the universe . here",
    "we assume both phases coincide for simplicity .",
    "in order for the tracking scenario to work , we must address the following two issues , apart from thermal effects which will be discussed later .",
    "first , it must trace the time evolution of the minimum adiabatically in the postinflationary universe when the effective potential is given by eq .  .",
    "second , the initial fluctuations of the singlet field generated during inflation are small enough not to create different domains at a later time . in this section",
    "we discuss the former issue .    in terms of @xmath58 , eq .",
    "is expressed as @xmath59 the angular direction has one of the minima at @xmath60 , where the radial direction feels the potential @xmath61 which is minimized at @xmath62 neglecting the motion in the phase direction and fixing as @xmath60 , we obtain the equation for the radial direction : @xmath63 by introducing a new variable @xmath64 , the above equation can be rewritten as @xmath65 = 0 , \\label{eom_xi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the tracking scenario works only if @xmath68 holds throughout its evolution .",
    "note that for @xmath69 , where @xmath70 represents the scale factor of the universe at a given time , we have @xmath71 and @xmath72 . just after inflation",
    "the inflaton field oscillates around the minimum of its potential behaving like a matter component , which leads to @xmath73 for the cosmic expansion .",
    "then we have @xmath74 , and @xmath75 becomes a solution of the field equation [ eq .  ] . however , this solution is unstable since the damping is negative , @xmath76 . in other words ,",
    "if there exists a deviation from @xmath75 initially , it grows with time and spoils the tracking mechanism when the deviation becomes @xmath77 .",
    "the instability described above can be alleviated if the coefficient @xmath53 or @xmath54 is sufficiently large .",
    "note that just before the end of inflation ( @xmath78 ) the damping is positive ( @xmath79 ) , and the field variable @xmath80 exponentially converges into the value determined by setting the bracket in the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eom_xi ] ) to zero , which reads @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "the effects of quantum fluctuations will be discussed and shown to be negligible in the next section . since @xmath83 just before the end of inflation",
    ", this fact implies that at this epoch the value of @xmath80 deviates from @xmath75 by the following quantity : @xmath84    after inflation , the initial deviation @xmath85 starts to grow . to see how it grows ,",
    "let us substitute @xmath86 with @xmath87 into eq .  .",
    "assuming that @xmath88 , @xmath74 , and @xmath89 during the inflaton - oscillation dominated phase , we have @xmath90 where we neglected the terms of higher order in @xmath91 .",
    "the above equation implies that the deviation grows with time as @xmath92 for @xmath82 .    in order to guarantee that the deviation from the minimum @xmath93 remains small throughout its evolution , we require the following condition : @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 represent the time at which the @xmath6 field reaches the global minimum and that at the end of inflation , respectively . in the second equality of the above equation , we used the fact that @xmath97 . here",
    "@xmath98 corresponds to the value at the end of inflation @xmath99 and @xmath100 corresponds to that at the global minimum [ see eq .  ] .",
    "the condition given by eq .",
    "implies that @xmath101    we summarize some representative values for the coefficients of the hubble - induced correction terms in table  [ tab1 ] . according to the amplitude of the hubble parameter during inflation ( and hence the energy scale of inflation )",
    ", relatively large coefficients are required .",
    "these required values might be much larger than those derived in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of the cosmological moduli problem .",
    "this is because there exist both positive and negative hubble - induced terms in the model considered in  @xcite , in contrast to the scenario in this paper where there exists the negative hubble - induced term only .",
    "in the latter case the dragging of the scalar field is not so efficient as we expect in the former case .",
    "likewise , we expect that the dragging mechanism of ref .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we also note that at the time @xmath105 , the @xmath6 field does not rotate in the phase direction as long as the @xmath22 term satisfies the condition given by eq .  .",
    "then the transition from one vacuum to others related by the @xmath0 transformations is prohibited even after the negative hubble - induced terms become irrelevant .",
    "let us next study the field configuration during inflation , keeping the above parameter values in mind .",
    "the potential minimum is located at @xmath106 [ see eq .  ] , and quantum fluctuations around it are estimated as @xmath107 where @xmath108 and it is assumed that only the mass term is important .",
    "thus , fluctuations along the radial direction are much smaller than the expectation value @xmath109 , and we may study fluctuations along the angular direction by setting @xmath110 .    the potential for the angular scalar field defined by @xmath111 is given by @xmath112 where the latter expression applies for small @xmath113 , and we can read off the mass of @xmath114 as @xmath115    let us estimate the number of domains where fluctuation along the angular direction exceeds @xmath116 to make a domain wall somewhere within our observable universe using the approximated potential [ eq .",

    "requiring that the above expression should be smaller than unity , we find only a mild constraint on @xmath10 .",
    "this can be easily seen from the exponent @xmath131 , which gives a huge negative contribution for @xmath132 .",
    "therefore to summarize , as long as the condition for the tracking behavior is satisfied , quantum fluctuations during inflation are suppressed both along radial and angular directions , so that the domain wall formation is always avoided .",
    "finally we consider possible thermal effects on the @xmath6 field after inflation .",
    "as the amplitude @xmath133 decreases with time , interactions with light fields in the thermal bath gradually come into play , which can destroy the @xmath6 field condensate to produce domain walls . in particular",
    ", we must ensure the following two conditions :    1 .",
    "thermal corrections of the form @xmath134 should be small enough to satisfy @xmath135 in order not to affect the tracking evolution of the @xmath6 field .",
    "2 .   the amplitude of thermal fluctuation @xmath136 of the @xmath6 field should be well below that of the background field @xmath137 ; otherwise they may cause transitions into different domains to create domain walls .    since @xmath138 and @xmath139",
    ", we see that these two requirements lead to the identical condition on the model parameters , which is solely determined by the dynamics of later times , since @xmath42 decreases faster than @xmath140 after inflation .",
    "hence , we have only to consider the constraint at the time when @xmath6 has almost reached the global minimum , i.e. , @xmath141 .",
    "therefore , we may impose the following condition to avoid destruction of the condensate with the potential given by @xmath142 , which gives a good approximation around @xmath143 .",
    "we have confirmed that for reasonable values of the model parameters the @xmath6 field does not move to other minima if the deviation from @xmath144 is less than @xmath145 , which we use as the criterion shown in eq .  .",
    "] : @xmath146 let us quantify eq .   more explicitly by considering the evolution of the universe after inflation",
    "just after inflation , the inflaton starts to oscillate around the minimum of its own potential , and it eventually decays into the ( ms)sm degrees of freedom to reheat the universe .",
    "there are two distinct possibilities : ( 1 ) the @xmath6 field reaches its global minimum during the inflaton - oscillation dominated phase before reheating is completed , and ( 2 ) the @xmath6 field reaches its global minimum in the radiation dominated epoch after reheating .    in the first scenario ,",
    "the temperature of the thermal bath is given by @xmath147  @xcite , where @xmath148 is the reheating temperature .",
    "at the relevant epoch we find @xmath149 , and eq",
    ".   leads to the following bound : @xmath150 since @xmath151 by assumption , we obtain an upper bound on @xmath148 : @xmath152    if the condition given by eq .",
    "is not satisfied , the @xmath6 field reaches its global minimum in the radiation dominated epoch after reheating . from the relation @xmath153",
    ", we have @xmath154 at @xmath155 , and by using eq .",
    ", we obtain @xmath156 note that the above condition makes sense only if there exists a large negative hubble - induced mass term @xmath157 and @xmath57 terms @xmath158 even after the reheating is completed .",
    "the existence of the negative hubble - induced mass term is foreseeable due to the susy breaking contributions from the thermal bath  @xcite .",
    "the phase of the coefficient @xmath54 of the hubble - induced @xmath57 term can change after reheating since the khler structures might change at that epoch , which induces a rotation of the @xmath6 field in the angular direction .",
    "this fact does not spoil the tracking mechanism as long as the magnitudes of the coefficients remain sufficiently large .",
    "the reason may be understood as follows : the angular motion induced by the change of the khler structures proceeds adiabatically with a hubble time scale , since the transition to the radiation dominated phase happens smoothly at that epoch .",
    "for such a smooth transition , the deviation from the minimum of the effective potential induced by the angular motion is at most @xmath159 , which remains negligible for large coefficients .    .",
    "domain walls are not produced in the region below the blue line corresponding to eqs .   and  .",
    "the region to the right side of the blue dotted line corresponding to eq .   also leads to the domain wall formation if the large negative hubble - induced mass is absent in the radiation dominated epoch after inflation .",
    "we also plot the values of the vev @xmath39 at the global minimum [ eq .  ] as purple chain lines . here",
    "we fix the values of other parameters as @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    figure  [ fig2 ] summarizes our analyses . combining two cases described above , we show the allowed parameter range for @xmath148 and @xmath163 . from the plot",
    "we see that the resolution of the domain wall problem requires a small value for the higgs - singlet coupling besides the large enough hubble - induced mass .",
    "the results obtained in this paper lead to several consequences for cosmology in the nmssm .",
    "first , for sufficiently small couplings the singlet sector would decouple from the thermal bath .",
    "a dominant interaction process between the singlet fields and the mssm fields is the @xmath164 interaction involving higgsinos and weak bosons ( and their susy partners ) , whose rate is roughly estimated as @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is the weak coupling strength .",
    "since this interaction rate is exponentially suppressed after the temperature of the thermal bath becomes less than @xmath167 , and the hubble parameter @xmath168 decays faster than @xmath169 , we expect that the fields in the singlet sector would never thermalize if the condition @xmath170 is satisfied at @xmath171 .",
    "this occurs if the value of the coupling satisfies @xmath172 for such a small coupling the singlino state can not be produced from the thermal bath , and it would not contribute to the dark matter abundance .",
    "finally , the @xmath6 field falls in the global minimum much earlier than the epoch of the electroweak phase transition @xmath173 , if the tracking mechanism works .",
    "therefore , the first order phase transition is not likely to be realized in this case .",
    "these facts would have an important consequence for the electroweak baryogenesis within nmssm and the mass range for the dark matter , which would now primarily contain the higgsino component  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that the domain wall problem of the nmssm can be resolved via the tracking mechanism if the following conditions are satisfied : ( 1 )  there exist negative hubble - induced corrections with sufficiently large coefficients [ see eq .  ] in the effective potential for the @xmath6 field during and after inflation .",
    "( 2 )  the @xmath22 term is slightly larger than the soft mass @xmath26 [ see eq .  ] in order to prevent the @xmath6 field from rotating in the phase direction at later times .",
    "( 3 )  the thermal effects must remain irrelevant ; see eq .  .",
    "this requirement leads to the constraints on the coupling strength and the reheating temperature as shown in fig .",
    "our study has many important phenomenological consequences for lhc and dark matter creation and detection within nmssm .",
    "let us briefly mention a particular relevance for the future experimental studies of nmssm .",
    "typically , in nmssm the higgs sector is enlarged due to the presence of a singlet , and for reasonably large couplings , i.e. , @xmath174 , higgs - to - higgs decays can possibly be observed in the forthcoming lhc experiment  @xcite . according to fig .",
