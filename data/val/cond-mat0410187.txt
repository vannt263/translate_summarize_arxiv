    "we compare our results in the previous section with properties of multi - scale cantor sets which are produced by splitting an interval into a definite number of subintervals with definite scales ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "we call the intervals of the multi - scale cantor sets `` bands '' , while we call the removed intervals as `` gaps '' .",
    "let us consider the band - width distribution of a multi - scale cantor set , @xmath94 .",
    "as far as we know , @xmath94 has not been appeared in the literature .",
    "however , kolmogorov s theory of turbulence @xcite introduces the energy distribution measured at a definite spatial scale , which is conceptually equivalent to @xmath94 of our case .",
    "we derive @xmath94 in the appendix , and it turns out to follow a logarithmic normal distribution as a distribution in kolmogorov s theory , @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 is the variance of the logarithm of the scales to generate a multi - scale cantor set and @xmath98 is the number of steps to produce the set .",
    "thus for a multi - scale cantor set , @xmath94 becomes broader for large @xmath98 and does not converge to a normalizable distribution .",
    "this contrasts with the behavior of @xmath22 for the fibonacci model .    as shown in the appendix",
    ", we can modify the construction of a multi - scale cantor set so that @xmath94 has a constant variance by including a finite size correction to the scales at each splitting step .",
    "when we write the width of a band produced at step @xmath99 as @xmath100 , @xmath101 would receive a correction proportional to @xmath102 .",
    "then @xmath103 a graph for a logarithmic normal distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ log - normal ]    at the origin , the logarithmic normal distribution approaches zero faster than power law . also at the tail ,",
    "it does not decay at an exponential rate .",
    "thus , the behavior of @xmath94 of this multi - scale cantor set with the finite size corrections shows differences from those of the fibonacci model .",
    "these differences may be rooted in the degree of self - similarity .",
    "the multi - scale cantor sets are genuinely self - similar : the same splitting procedure is applied to every interval at each step .",
    "this leads to a logarithm normal contribution . on the other hand ,",
    "the splitting of the energy levels of the fibonacci model is different for each band and it has different scales for different bands @xcite . in @xcite , it has been observed that numerical values of scales of the band s center coincide with eigenvalues of the linearized kkt map at the hyperbolic points of the corresponding periodic orbit and the splitting of the bands is explained by the smale s horseshoe structure .",
    "this observation can be applied to other periodic orbits corresponding to other bands .",
    "then , at least , some subsets of the bands are self - similar and should satisfy the band - width distribution like the multi - scale cantor sets .",
    "still a finite number of periodic orbits only lead to the sum of logarithmic normal distributions and can not explain fully the behavior of the fibonacci model .",
    "then our comparison implies that , to understand the behavior of @xmath22 of the fibonacci model by the language of dynamical system , it is necessary to include finite size corrections as well as an infinite number of periodic orbits .",
    "such a fine structure of fractal is not taken into account in multifractal analysis of @xcite , which characterizes fractal objects by the statistical distribution of scales .",
    "as proved in @xcite , the energy spectra of the fibonacci model belong to a class of a general cantor set .",
    "thus they belong to a different class of cantor sets to the multi - scale cantor sets .",
    "we also compare the results for the gap distribution .",
    "the gap distribution of the multi - scale cantor set follows an inverse power law near the origin @xmath89 @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the hausdorff dimension .",
    "this is because the length of gaps of a multi - scale cantor set is directly related to the length of the removed elements since the bands and gaps are complementary in a fixed interval .",
    "although the fibonacci model have an inverse power law like eq.([gapcantor ] ) for the gap distribution , the relation @xmath106 does not hold for the fibonacci model because of the value of the hausdorff dimension @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the splitting of the energy levels as observed in fig .",
    "1 : the energy levels of the fibonacci model have fluctuating endpoints , and the bands and the gaps are not complementary of a fixed interval , and hence have different scaling properties . on the other hand , for the harper model , the numerical results of @xcite seem to sustain the relation @xmath108 . from the same reasoning",
    ", there seems to exist no explanation for it actually .",
    "spectral properties of the fibonacci model are examined numerically by using the kohmoto - kadanoff - tang map .",
    "we investigated the band - width distribution @xmath22 and the gap distribution @xmath28 .",
    "we find a power law @xmath109 near the origin and an exponential decay @xmath3 toward infinity ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "also @xmath28 diverges with an inverse power law @xmath111 near the origin ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "the indices turn out to depend on the coupling constants through the constant of motion in the kohmoto - kadanoff - tang map .",
    "we compare the band - width distribution @xmath22 and the gap distribution @xmath28 of the fibonacci model with those of multi - scale cantor sets .",
    "as the distribution of the  band \" widths @xmath94 for multi - scale cantor sets always obeys a logarithmic normal distribution , the behavior of @xmath22 is rather different from that of @xmath94 .",
    "also , while the distribution of the `` gaps '' @xmath113 of the multi - scale cantor sets is an inverse power law @xmath111 near the origin ( @xmath112 ) and there is the relation between the index @xmath88 and its hausdorff dimension , the relation does not hold for the fibonacci model .",
    "thus the critical level statistics is useful to quantify differences between the energy spectra of the fibonacci models and multi - scale cantor sets which are hidden in the language of multifractal analysis .",
