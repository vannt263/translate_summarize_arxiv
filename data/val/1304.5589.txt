    "it is well known that the process of a particle quantum tunneling through a barrier will take a time duration . among various proposed expressions",
    "@xcite , group delay @xcite ( @xmath0 , also known as phase time in the literature ) and dwell time @xcite ( @xmath1 ) are two well - established ones .",
    "the group delay is the duration between the appearing time of the reflection or transmission particle pulse and the arrival time of the incident pulse , while the dwell time is the time a particle lingers in the barrier region ( see , fig .",
    "[ setup]b ) .",
    "they describe the tunneling speed through a barrier in different aspects , and are both of paramount importance for solid - state devices working at high frequencies @xcite . recently ,",
    "as graphene rises as a star material in condensed matter physics , extensive efforts @xcite have been devoted to the investigations of group delay and/or dwell time in it .     and",
    "@xmath2 components , which are located at @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 for the incident , reflected , and transmitted beams , respectively .",
    "( c ) experimental setup for measuring the cgd by spin precession .",
    "four ferromagnetic electrodes magnetized respectively along the @xmath6- , @xmath6- , @xmath7- , and @xmath7-axis are contacted to the graphene barrier , and a weak magnetic field is applied in the graphene plane along the @xmath8-axis .",
    "the contact induced potential @xcite can be avoided by such four points probe @xcite and the intrinsic conductance through the barrier can be measured by @xmath9 . the length of the electrodes themselves are assumed to be small compared with @xmath10 so that the precession in them can be neglected . ]",
    "unlike in single - electron devices , the current in bulk graphene devices is contributed by numerous electrons or holes on half of the fermi surface .",
    "this fact implies that a _ collective _ group delay ( cgd ) of all these particles rather than an individual group delay ( igd ) of a single particle should be adopted to evaluate the tunneling speed in graphene .",
    "the cgd can be defined as the summation of mode ( @xmath11)-dependent igds weighted with corresponding transmission probability ( @xmath12 ) , i.e. , @xmath13 . in this work",
    "we theoretically investigate the cgd in graphene .",
    "our motivation is two - fold .",
    "( i ) cgd in graphene is not directly observable . very recently ,",
    "an approach using a larmor clock @xcite has been suggested to measure the transmission times @xmath14 ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) at the especial fermi energy that aligns to the barrier charge neutrality point ( or dirac point ) @xcite .",
    "however , the tunability of the fermi energy is necessary in graphene devices ; while the dynamics in graphene becomes totally different when the fermi energy aligns to or diverges from the barrier dirac point ( i.e. , pseudodiffusive @xcite for the former and ballistic @xcite for the latter case ) .",
    "so , how to measure the ballistic cgd at _ arbitrary _ fermi energy is still a basic problem . to propose a feasible approach to measure the ballistic cgd at arbitrary fermi energy",
    "is our first motivation .",
    "( ii ) the ballistic transport in graphene is essentially two dimensional ( 2d ) . as a result , a lateral goos - hnchen ( gh )",
    "shift @xcite occurs for the reflected or transmitted wave packet along the corresponding interface @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ setup]b ) .",
    "as we will show , such gh shift makes an intrinsic contribution to the igd .",
    "this fact has not been noticed in previous studies in graphene . it should be clarified no matter for the sake of itself or before we consider the measure problem of cgd . to obtain the complete expression of 2d igd with the gh component contained",
    "is our second motivation .    in this work , through the analogy between ballistic electrons and photons , we obtain the complete expression of the 2d igd and show that , the inherent gh component adds an asymmetric feature to the igd s energy dependence . by linking the 2d igd to spin precession through the 2d dwell time ,",
    "we further suggest that , for any fermi energy comparable with the barrier height , the cgd and its gh component can be probed through conductance measurements in a spin precession experiment under weak magnetic fields .",
    "to investigate the 2d igd , let us consider the 2d quantum tunneling through a potential barrier in graphene ( see , fig .",
    "[ setup](a)(b ) ) .",
    "the size of the graphene sample is set to be smaller than the electron mean free path ( @xmath17 0.5 - 1@xmath18 m @xcite ) and the phase - relaxation length ( @xmath19 3 - 5@xmath18 m @xcite ) to ensure the system stays in the ballistic coherent regime .",
    "a real potential occupies the region of @xmath20 and is translational invariant in the @xmath6-direction ; it can be induced by a top gate due to the electric field effect @xcite .",
    "the fermi energy is @xmath21 and can be controlled by a back gate @xcite .",
    "the sample width @xmath22 in the @xmath6-direction is several times of @xmath10 to ensure that the edge details are not important @xcite .",
    "an electron with a central incident angle of @xmath23 at the fermi surface incidents from the left side of the barrier . in the stationary state description",
    ", the spinor of electron envelope function @xmath24 can be represented as a wave packet of a weighted superposition of plane wave spinors ( each being a solution of dirac s equation ) @xcite .",
    "the appearing loci ( @xmath25 ) and moments ( @xmath26 ) for the @xmath27 and @xmath2 ( @xmath28 ) component of the incident , reflection , and transmission ( @xmath29 ) packet peaks ( see , fig .",
    "[ setup](b ) ) are determined by the following condition : the gradient of the _ total _ phase ( @xmath30 ) in the wave vector ( @xmath31 ) space must vanish . here , @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) and",
    "@xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) are the reflection ( transmission ) coefficient and corresponding phase shift , respectively ( see , fig . [ setup](b ) ) .",
    "this is similar to the optical case @xcite but with the extra sublattice degree of freedom ( @xmath36 ) . since @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the above condition means two independent conditions @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "a comparison of the second conditions between the reflection ( transmission ) and incident beams gives the sublattice dependent lateral gh shift @xcite : @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( see , fig .",
    "[ setup](b ) ) .",
    "a comparison of the first conditions gives the reflection and transmission 2d igd , @xmath43_\\alpha.\\ ] ] here sublattice independent average values of gh shifts @xmath44 have been used to evaluate the igd for the electron spinor rather than its sublattice components .",
    "for asymmetric barriers , there is a difference between the reflection and transmission in both @xmath45 and @xmath46 , so a bidirectional 2d igd can be defined as @xmath47 .    ) as a function of the fermi energy at @xmath48 .",
    "the magenta thin solid curve stands for the time associated with the snell shift , @xmath49 .",
    "the parameters of the potential barrier ( which are also used in figs . 3 - 5 ) are @xmath50 and @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 being a length unit and energy unit , respectively . ]    in the 1d case the bidirectional igd has an expression of @xmath54 , which stems solely from the phase shifts introduced by scattering at the interfaces @xcite . comparing the two expressions , we can find that the differences come in two aspects between the 2d and 1d cases .",
    "firstly , the differential in the 1d case becomes partial differential in the 2d one , i.e. , @xmath55 .",
    "secondly , besides the scattering phase shifts in the 1d case , the gh shifts also contribute inherent phase shifts in the 2d case , i.e. , @xmath56 .    to highlight the intrinsic contribution of the gh shifts , we rewrite the bidirectional 2d igd as @xmath57 the first component @xmath58 comes from the scattering phase shifts at the interfaces , which is the same as the 1d case ; while the second component @xmath59 results from the gh shifts , which is totally absent in the 1d case .",
    "note , we have used the relation @xmath60 to get the gh component , since the gh shifts are not explicit functions of the energy .",
    "we would like to stress that , although the gh component displays a partial differential respective to @xmath61 at fixed @xmath21 ( i.e. , @xmath59 and @xmath62 ) , this component essentially comes from the condition that the energy gradient of the gh phase shifts ( i.e. , @xmath63 ) must vanish . we can understand the gh component as following . at time @xmath64 , the wave front of the transmitted beam reaches @xmath65 and then propagates freely with a velocity of @xmath66 to the final position @xmath67 ( see , fig .",
    "[ setup](b ) ) .",
    "this step will cost a duration of @xmath68 since the wave front is perpendicular to the propagation direction .",
    "this picture also holds for the reflected beam .",
    "a weighted average of the transmission and reflection gives @xmath69 .",
    "figure [ contribution ] shows clearly the contribution of the gh component to the 2d igd .",
    "one can see that @xmath70 is symmetric about the center ( @xmath71 ) of the transmission gap ( tg ) due to the symmetry of @xmath72 about it . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath73 stemming from the quantum gh shifts is asymmetric about the tg s center .",
    "the quantum gh shift displays the same trend as the classical shift predicted by the snell s law ( @xmath74 with @xmath75 being the refracted angle ) .",
    "the latter is obviously asymmetric as it is negative ( positive ) in the low ( high ) energy range ( see fig . [ contribution ] ) . in total",
    ", the gh component not only quantitatively contributes a part of order of @xmath76 to the 2d igd , but also qualitatively results in the remarkable asymmetric feature in the energy dependence of the 2d igd .",
    "having obtained the complete expression for the igd , we now seek physical observable for the cgd at arbitrary fermi energy .",
    "the larmor precession of the electron spin in a magnetic field provides a clock for studying the electron dynamics @xcite . here",
    ", we consider a configuration where the magnetic field is applied in the graphene plane along the @xmath8-axis ( see , fig .",
    "[ setup](c ) ) .",
    "in such a configuration , the dynamical perturbation by the lorentz force is avoided , and the only effect of the magnetic field is to cause spin precession round the @xmath8-axis . for electrons with spins initially directing the @xmath6-axis , a duration of this precession leads to different transmission probabilities in the @xmath77 and @xmath78 directions .",
    "we calculate the spin - dependent transmission probability ( @xmath79 ) in a pseudospin - spin direct product space ( a similar method is used in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , where @xmath80 denotes the transmission probability for an electron incident from electrode 2 ( with @xmath6-directed spin ) and transmitted to electrode 3 ( with @xmath77 or @xmath78-directed spin ) ( see , fig .",
    "[ setup](c ) ) . an explicit equality between the spin polarization in transmission probabilities @xmath81 and the dwell time ( @xmath82 ) is found in the weak - field limit : @xmath83 where",
    ", @xmath84 is the larmor frequency , @xmath85 is the gyromagnetic factor in graphene , @xmath86 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath2 is the magnetic field with a reduced strength @xmath87 .",
    "this equality is clearly demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ dwell ] .",
    "note , this equality is restricted in symmetric structures @xcite . under such restriction eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) holds for _ arbitrary _ incident energies and angles and can be interpreted physically in following . rewriting the equality as @xmath88 and multiplying both sides by @xmath89",
    ", the right hand side gives the expectation value of @xmath90 of the transmitted electrons .",
    "such expectation value is determined by the product of the spin precession frequencey ( i.e. , the larmor frequency ) and the time the precession persists ( i.e. , the dwell time ) .",
    "this is just what the left hand side expresses .",
    "it is noted that eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) also holds in systems with parabolic dispersion relations and scale envelope functions @xcite .     at various @xmath91 as a function of the fermi energy at @xmath48 . ]    to obtain the summation of the dwell time on half of the fermi surface , we multiply eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) by @xmath92 ( which tends to @xmath93 when @xmath94 ) .",
    "then the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) can be further related to an experimental observable , the conductance ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "this is because the conductance is defined as @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the quantum conductance considering the twofold valley degeneracy .",

    "insert : the collective self - interference delay versus the fermi energy . ]",
    "we now try to link the cgd to the above conductance difference by the relation between the 2d igd and the 2d dwell time .",
    "this relation can be obtained by making a variation of the time - independent dirac equation at the barrier boundary with respect to the two individual variational parameters , ( @xmath100 , @xmath61 ) or equivalently ( @xmath21 , @xmath101 ) .",
    "the 2d feature of the tunneling process and the spinor nature of envelope functions should be taken into account in the variation , for which the detailed derivations can be found in the appendix .",
    "we make the variation with respect to @xmath21 and @xmath102 , since the variation results about them can be expediently related to @xmath70 ( see , eqs .",
    "( [ aeq3])-([aeq7 ] ) in the appendix ) and @xmath73 ( see , eqs .",

( [ aeq7 ] ) in the appendix ) stemming from the interference of the incident and reflection envelope functions in front of the barrier @xcite .",
    "the correctness of this relation can be verified by numerically calculating and comparing the explicit expressions of @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",
    "[ threetimes ] shows the 2d igd , dwell time , and self - interference delay in reduced form as a function of the fermi energy at a fixed incident angle , where @xmath108 is the reduction factor .",
    "one can see that the reduced self - interference delay ( @xmath109 ) is symmetric about the tg s center ; it achieves the maximum at the tg s center and oscillates around zero outside the tg .",
    "the self - interference delay itself is important only in the low energy range ( diverging as @xmath110 when @xmath111 ) .",
    "it disappears at ( anti)resonant tunneling since there is no interference in front of the barrier .",
    "accordingly , the igd almost coincides with the dwell time except within the low energy range or around the tg s center .    the collective self - interference delay ( @xmath112 ) can be calculated by using @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the number of the transverse modes ( which should be rather big ) . as can be seen in the insert of fig .",
    "[ threetimes ] , @xmath112 oscillates with @xmath21 with the amplitude disappearing exponentially at a relatively high fermi energy",

    "the spin - precession induced conductance difference can be obtained by measuring @xmath117 and @xmath118 separately ( see insert in fig .",
    "[ conductance ] ) and it increases for weaker @xmath91 ( see fig . [ conductance ] ) . at @xmath121 , it is already a rather good measurement of the cgd for @xmath122 .",
    "thus , we provide an electrostatic approach to measure the cgd in graphene , which is feasible for almost arbitrary fermi energy .",
    "this approach looks interesting when we notice that the cgd describes a dynamic process while the conductance is static .    in fig .",
    "[ conductance ] , it is also noted that , due to the gh shifts with different signs , the scattering component is always larger ( smaller ) than the expected value of the cgd when @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "then , a comparison between the experimentally observed value of the conductance difference ( the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ observe ] ) ) and the theoretical prediction of the cgd ( the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ observe ] ) ) at fermi energies away from the barrier dirac point can be utilized to probe the inherent gh component of the cgd ( or equivalently the intrinsic effect of the gh shifts on the cgd ) in graphene .",
    "in summary , we have obtained the complete expression of the 2d igd in graphene with the intrinsic contribution of the gh shifts being contained . moreover , we have proposed an approach to probe the ballistic cgd and its inherent gh component by conductance measurements in a weak - field spin precession experiment .",
    "this approach is feasible for almost arbitrary fermi energy .",
    "we have also indicated that , it is a generally nonzero self - interference delay that relates the 2d igd and dwell time in graphene .",
    "the inherent gh component of the 2d igd should also present in other 2d ballistic coherent electronic systems , since the derivations of it do not depend on the specific electronic excitation of graphene .",
    "the feasibility of the proposed approach to measure cgd in these systems is an interesting question .",
