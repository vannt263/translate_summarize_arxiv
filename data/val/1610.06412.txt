    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are close binary systems consisting of a mass - accreting white dwarf ( wd ) and a mass - donating late - type main - sequence companion star . intermediate polars ( ips ) , an important subclass of cvs , are considered to involve wds with magnetic field of @xmath4 g. in an ip , gas from the companion forms an accretion disk down to a radius @xmath5 where gravity is counter - balanced by the magnetic pressure .",
    "then the gas is captured by the wd s magnetosphere , and accretes onto the wd surface to form accretion columns due to strong magnetic field . in the accretion column ,",
    "the gas is heated up to @xmath6 k by a standing shock , and lands onto the wd surface emitting thermal x - rays .",
    "if @xmath5 is far enough from the wd surface , the temperature @xmath7 just below the shock is proportional to gravitational potential of the wd ( aizu 1973 ) : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is mean molecular weight and @xmath10 is the proton mass .",
    "therefore the wd can be estimated by combining the measured @xmath7 with the standard mass v.s .",
    "radius ( @xmath11-@xmath12 ) relation ( nauenberg 1972 ) .",
    "an x - ray spectrum from ips is a superposition of optically - thin thermal emissions of various temperatures , from @xmath7 downwards . to determine @xmath7",
    ", it is hence important to accurately measure both the hard x - ray continuum , and the ratio of fe xxv and xxvi lines at @xmath13 kev .",
    "this is because the hard x - ray continuum is sensitive to the hottest components ( with temperature @xmath14 ) , whereas the latter tells us contributions from cooler components arising closer to the wd surface .",
    "this method has been established with x - ray satellites such as _ ginga _",

    "gk persei , a cataclysmic variable system , is interestingly categorized as both a dwarf nova and an ip . after a classical nova explosion in 1901 ( williams 1901",
    "; hale 1901 ) , it repeats , every 23 years , dwarf nova outbursts each lasting for 2 months ( e.g. imon 2001 ) . during outbursts , the optical and x - ray luminosities increase by a factor of 1020 .",
    "the distance was measured to be @xmath15 pc ( harrison & bornak 2013 ) .",
    "reinsch ( 1994 ) and morales - rueda et al .",
    "( 2002 ) optically determined the wd mass as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "an outburst from gk persei started in march 2015 , and continued for 2 months ( wilber et al .",
    "2015 ) . during this outburst , a too ( target of opportunity ) observation of _",
    "nustar _ was triggered ( zemko et al . 2016 ) .",
    "suleimanov et al .",
    "( 2016 ) analyzed the too data and constrained the wd mass as @xmath18 .",
    "_ suzaku _ was serendipitously pointed at the onset of this outburst ( yuasa et al .",
    "2016 ) . with _ nustar _ , we observed gk persei again , after the object returned to its quiescence .",
    "the present paper describes a combined analysis of the outburst and quiescence data from _",
    "the x - ray satellite _ nustar _ ( harrison et al .",
    "2013 ) , launched on 2012 june 13 , has a 379 kev sensibility .",
    "it is thus suited for our purpose , because we can study both the hard x - ray continuum and the fe - k lines .",
    "as described in  1 , gk persei was observed twice with _ nustar _",
    ", once at the outburst peak and the other after the outburst terminated .",
    "details of the observations are shown in table 1 .",
    "we extracted the data from the two focal plane modules ( fpma and fpmb ) with nupipeline and nuproducts included in nustardas version 1.5.1 .",
    "the source region was chosen to be a circle of @xmath19 radius for the outburst data , and @xmath20 for the quiescence data .",
    "the remaining region was used for background .",
