    "nowadays technology allows to fabricate artificial arrays of antidot scatterers which form superlattices in semiconductor heterostructures with a two dimensional electron gas ( 2des ) ( see e.g. @xcite and refs . therein ) .",

    "the effects of chaotic dynamics and contributions of unstable periodic orbits on electron conductivity have been clearly seen experimentally .",

    "the irradiation of such superlattices by a microwave field @xcite opens interesting possibilities for microwave control of electron current in nanostructures .",
    "these systems of relatively large period are classical , and the periodic potential is the source of electron scattering .    unlike arrays of symmetric antidots , studied experimentally in early works , more sophisticated systems were for a long time out of attention .",

    "similar direct current caused by temporal irreversibility due to simultaneous action of two electromagnetic fields with frequencies @xmath1 and @xmath2 is known as the coherent photogalvanic effect ( cpge ) ) @xcite",
    ".    appearance of directed transport without obvious directed forces is also known as ratchet effect which has a long history .",
    "for example , the behavior of a ratchet under the influence of thermal fluctuations was considered in the textbook by feynman , leighton and sands @xcite in connection with the problem of reversibility in statistical mechanics .",
    "recently the ratchet problem attracted a great interest of the scientific community @xcite .",
    "in fact the photogalvanic effect corresponds to a ratchet subjected to weak alternating force with zero mean .",
    "such ratchets have been observed in various physical systems including josephson junction arrays @xcite , cold atoms @xcite , macroporous silicon membranes @xcite , microfluidic channels @xcite and other systems .",
    "the growing interest to ratchets is strongly stimulated by their possible applications to biological systems @xcite . in this sense",
    "the artificial asymmetric nanostructures , as those discussed in @xcite and here , can serve as a prototype for understanding of photocurrent properties in biomolecules .",
    "the results obtained for ratchets induced by microwave fields in nanostructures can be also used for understanding of directed transport created by _",
    "ac-_fields in molecular electronics @xcite .",
    "relatively recently an artificial lattice of asymmetric antidots ( triangles ) participating in transport as scatterers of electrons was realized experimentally .",
    "it exhibited the direct current induced by alternating electric field @xcite .",
    "the effect of such type was considered theoretically in @xcite by means of the classical kinetic equation for the system with weak asymmetric periodic lateral potential .",
    "another case of superlattices of asymmetric antidots ( semidisks oriented in one direction or the semidisk galton board ) has been proposed and analyzed theoretically @xcite by simulations of motion of a particle subjected to alternating force with zero means and collisions with hard - wall antidots .",
    "it has been shown that a microwave radiation creates the directed flow of electrons .",
    "the velocity of this flow @xmath3 is proportional to a friction coefficient while the direction of current depends on the microwave polarization .",
    "the directed transport induced by a microwave field appears also for an ensemble of noninteracting particles been at a thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath4 .",
    "this effect is absent in structures with circular antidots due to symmetry conservation .",
    "recently , semidisk galton board realized experimentally @xcite exhibited the rectification of high - frequency electric field .",
    "in @xcite the properties of photocurrent in asymmetric nanostructures have been explained on the basis of heuristic arguments and extensive numerical simulations .",
    "however , the analytical theory of the effect still needs to be developed .",
    "this aim is reached in this paper with the help of a kinetic equation approach applied to a specific model of asymmetric scatterers ( cuts model ) .",
    "this approach allows to obtain analytical dependence of photocurrent properties on system parameters .",
    "here we study a simple model of anisotropic 2d artificial scatterers , which permits the analytical consideration in the framework of kinetic equation approximation and leads to the pge .",
    "the kinetic equation was used in a number of papers devoted to photogalvanic effect .",
    "unlike the particle dynamics method , this way suggests the developed chaos picture where ergodicity of motion is achieved . at the same time it is free from the voluntary assumptions about the particle friction used in @xcite .",
    "the system under consideration contains randomly distributed oriented scatterers .",
    "the scatterers are assumed to be segments of the length @xmath5 oriented along the @xmath6 axis ; one side ( left ) of the segment is specular and the other side is diffusive ( see fig . [ cuts ] ) .",
    "the concentration of scatterers @xmath7 is supposedly low : @xmath8 . in this approximation",
    "the kind of spatial distribution of scatterers ( random or periodic ) is of no importance .",
    "besides , to limit the possible divergency of the result we include isotropic impurity scattering into our model .",
    "this system can be considered as a simplification of the semicircle model studied in @xcite .",
    "in fact , the diffusive side of the cut scatters particles like round side of the semicircle , if not to pay attention on the difference between randomized ( in our case ) and deterministic ( in semicircle case ) motion .",
    "the advantage of `` cuts '' model is its exact solvability .",
    "the kinetic equation reads as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the distribution function , @xmath11 is the electron momentum .",
    "the term ( @xmath12 ) represents the action of electric field @xmath13 of the electromagnetic wave with the complex amplitude @xmath14 : @xmath15\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as it will be seen further , the acceleration in the @xmath6 direction can not be limited by the scattering on segments only because electrons moving in this direction do not relax .",
    "this is why we have not restricted our consideration by the collision with cuts only but have also taken into account the impurity scattering .",
    "hence the collision integral @xmath16 is assumed to consist of impurity - induced @xmath17 and segment - induced @xmath18 collision integrals . the segment - induced collision integral @xmath19.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "is determined by the scattering probability on the cuts @xmath20 :    @xmath21,\\ ] ]    where @xmath22 is the corresponding characteristic time , @xmath23 ; @xmath24 is the heaviside function .",
    "the impurity scattering is suggested to be isotropic : @xmath25 where @xmath26 means average over angles , @xmath27 is the relaxation time corresponding additional isotropic scattering .",
    "we shall solve the kinetic equation eq.([kin])in the second order on electric field . in the elastic approximation",
    "the collision operator is degenerate because its action on the isotropic function gives zero ; thus this operator has an eigenfunction with zero eigenvalue .",
    "physically , this means that the elastic scattering does not change any distribution function depending only on the energy .",
    "but if to project the gilbert space of distribution functions on the subspace with zero angular average , the corresponding projection of the scattering operator becomes non - degenerate .",
    "so if to consider only the distribution functions with zero mean , the elastic scattering operator remains non - degenerate and can be treated as full relaxation operator .",
    "inelastic scattering controls only isotropic part of the distribution function which ( if it is weaker than elastic one ) has no impact on the pge .    in the second order on alternating electric field the steady current density",
    "is described by the phenomenological expression @xmath28 the symmetry of the considered system allows the following non - zero components of the photogalvanic tensor @xmath29 : @xmath30 from eq.([j ] ) it follows that components @xmath31 and @xmath32 are real .",

    "all components tend to zero for @xmath75 and exhibit non - analytical behavior at @xmath86 .",
    "asymptotic behavior @xmath107 ( or @xmath108 ) at large @xmath87 follows from the odd dependence of the current on the asymmetric scattering on the cuts that results in the proportionality of the current to the scattering rate on cuts for low their concentration .",

    "such behavior results from the absence of relaxation of electrons moving along @xmath6 axis .",
    "the state with @xmath113 plays role of a drain for electrons .",
    "these electrons do not participate in the transport along @xmath36 axis , but due to absence of relaxation they accumulate in the state @xmath113 ; this suppresses the distribution function with finite @xmath114 , and @xmath115 . on the contrary",
    ", the transport along @xmath6 axis diverges due to the same reason .    for linear polarized electric field the signs of current components depend on the direction of polarization .",
    "physically , this can be explained by the effective increase of the mean - squared component of electron momentum along field and subsequent increase ( decrease ) of scattering on the cuts .",
    "let electron with a momentum @xmath116 impacts with a cut .",
    "the change of momentum are equal to @xmath117 for an electron with the momentum @xmath118 and @xmath119 for an electron with the opposite momentum , respectively . in equilibrium",
    "this change is compensated by the contributions of other electrons .",
    "but the increase of the mean - squared component of electron momentum along field gives the finite positive contribution to the total current .",
    "the acceleration of an electron by the field in @xmath6 direction increases @xmath6 component of the momentum and produces the opposite direction of @xmath120 .",
    "the values of coefficients @xmath121 are essentially larger than @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "it is a consequence of the fact that the motion along @xmath6 direction is collisionless unless the impurity scattering is taken into account .",
    "obviously , the difference is more pronounced at low @xmath87 .",
    "it is useful to calculate the possible maximal pge coefficient . from said above it follows that this maximum is achieved for the component @xmath122 at low frequencies @xmath123 and for clean material @xmath124 .",
    "in this case we have @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the electron concentration , @xmath127 , @xmath128 is the angle of electric field with respect to the @xmath36 direction .",
    "the estimation gives the value @xmath129a / cm for @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132cm / s .",
    "the special case is the limit of zero impurity concentration .",
    "as we have found , in this case for finite frequency the current in @xmath36 direction becomes equal to zero and infinity for @xmath6 direction . from said above it",
    "is evident that the inelastic collisions become essential : they limit this non - analytical behavior .",
    "the careful examination of this question is beyond the paper .",

    "is evident that the inelastic collisions become essential : they limit this non - analytical behavior .",
    "the careful examination of this question is beyond the paper .",
    "we have restricted ourselves by the classical consideration only .",
    "two quantum factors have not been taken into account : comparability of @xmath133 with characteristic electron energies , the fermi energy and the temperature , and the quantum corrections to conductivity .",
    "it should be emphasized that in used approximation the pge in the metal case does not depend on the temperature in the low temperature limit .",
    "this is because the momentum relaxation in metal is temperature - independent ( unlike energy relaxation ) .",
    "despite the involvement of energy relaxation into the control on the distribution function , the current in the second order in electric field is determined by the contributions which do not depend on energy relaxation .",
    "the quantum corrections suppress the low temperature transport and should lead to the temperature dependence of the effect .",
    "both modelling of @xcite and the present theory neglect quantum corrections .",
    "thereupon , the temperature dependence of steady current in @xcite is not clear .",
    "the approach of these papers used a friction force essentially depending on the excess electron energy .",
    "possibly , it is the reason of the temperature dependence .",
    "it should be mentioned that the quantum corrections are of less importance in high - mobility samples utilized usually in experiments with antidots .",
    "in this section we compare our results with the simulations of the flow velocity of a particle colliding with semidisks.@xcite we consider the model used here as a simplification of the semidisks model of ref .",
    "the essential differences between approaches of ref.@xcite and the present paper are : periodic / random distribution of asymmetric scatterers , deterministic / chaotic character of electron scattering on antidots and motion between them , and absence / presence of the gas approximation .",
    "however , the case of low density of semidisks and weak friction corresponds to the gas approximation because the scattering randomizes the motion well enough , and the results of both approaches should be in accord with each other .",
    "the fig.6 in @xcite shows approximate quadratic dependence of the flow velocity on the alternating field what agrees with the second - order in field approximation used in the present paper .",
    "the dependence fig.7 from @xcite demonstrates the drop of the flow velocity with the growth of the semidisk size .",
    "this behavior qualitatively corresponds to the drop @xmath134 for @xmath135 ( fig.2 of present paper ) . at the same time",
    "there is no drop in this figure for large @xmath136 following from the present paper .",
    "the dependence of the flow velocity on the distance between semidisk centers ( fig.8 from @xcite ) can be treated as rescaled dependence of @xmath31 on the mean free time @xmath137 which in the present case vanishes both for @xmath138 and @xmath136 ( fig.2 of the present paper ) .",
    "the dependence of the flow velocity ( fig.9 in @xcite ) on the impurity scattering also has a drop for @xmath139 , like expected from the eq.([121 ] ) , but there is no drop in this figure for large @xmath27 .    hence , there is a partial qualitative accordance between the present results and computer simulations of @xcite .",
    "the origin of discrepancy needs additional study .",
    "the considered system of oriented asymmetric scatterers - cuts has @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath121 non - zero components of photogalvanic tensor .",
    "the linear photogalvanic effect is determined by @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath35 .",
    "the circular - polarized illumination , causes the response of the @xmath6 component of current only , determined by @xmath37 .",
    "the static limit of the current in impurity - free system is ambiguous , depending on value of the product of frequency to the impurity mean - free time .",
    "the @xmath36 component of the current is limited and in the impurity - free system tends to zero , while the @xmath6-component tends to infinity .",
    "this is explained by the accumulation of electrons in the state with zero @xmath36-component of momentum .",
