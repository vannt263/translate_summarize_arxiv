    "loss of quantum coherence , quantum entanglement , quantum beating , wave function collapse and several related issues are at the heart of quantum features that must be necessarily considered in order to construct a suitable quantum measurement theory @xcite .",

    "more particularly , the effect of phase - space noncommutativity on phenomena such as quantum beating , missing information and decoherence .    to start with , noncommutativity in the configuration space has been firstly suggested as a way to regularize quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is a long - held belief that in quantum theories which include gravity , the nature of the space - time is modified at the planck scale , and that noncommutativity must be considered at high energy scales .",
    "noncommutative geometry is also encountered in the context of string theory / m - theory @xcite .",
    "we also mention that several aspects of nc theories have been studied , including noncommutative gauge and field theories @xcite .    in the quantum mechanical context , nc extensions have been discussed with respect to the quantum hall effect @xcite , for electrons in a magnetic field projected to the lowest level in the landau problem in the phase - space @xcite , for the @xmath0-dimensional ( 2d ) quantum harmonic oscillator in cartesian coordinates @xcite , and in the gravitational quantum well for ultra - cold neutrons @xcite .",

    "it is important to stress that phase - space nc extensions of qm have striking features .",
    "these include putative violations of the robertson - schrdinger uncertainty relation @xcite , a feature that has somehow been observed in a recent experiment @xcite . moreover , the regularizing features of phase - space nc qm are remarkable and shown in minisuperspace quantum cosmology models @xcite , and in black - hole physics where a @xmath2 wave - function can be found and the singularity problem can be resolved @xcite .",

    "not less important , is the missing information due to probability distribution distortions , which can be displayed through the coupling of nc degrees of freedom to a thermal reservoir .",

    "the quantum entropy destroyed by the nc character is quantified and a well - defined prescription for the wave function distortion in thermodynamic equilibrium is obtained .",
    "results for the thermodynamic limit of the internal energy , boltzmann entropy , and heat capacity are derived .",
    "the quantum issue of the 2d nc harmonic oscillator is reformulated in section v. it is shown that some aspects of the axial symmetry of the problem allow for a factorization of the nc effects .",
    "obtaining a well - defined quantum number and a factorizable wave - function component for noncommutativity are shown to be relevant for quantifying the nc effects on the 2d quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "finally , we draw our conclusions in section vi and address some related issues concerning the anisotropic nc harmonic oscillator , and possible extra linear contributions to the potential in space coordinates .",
    "the predictive power of qm relies on its formalism to connect quantum observables to expectation values . in this respect ,",
    "the wigner function and the weyl transform establish an alternative formulation to the better known schrdinger and heisenberg frameworks .",
    "this formalism provides an interesting insight into the nature of qm and its classical limit .",
    "the wigner representation has also the operational advantage of exhibiting all the information about the state vector in the phase - space .",
    "this contrasts with the conventional qm approach which provides information about position , or momentum , but not both together .",
    "this formulation is akin to the formalism of statistical mechanics .",
    "the inception of the wigner function is the definition of the weyl transform of an operator @xmath3 through the expression @xmath4}\\,\\langle q - y/2 | \\hat{o } | q + y/2 \\rangle = \\int \\hspace{-.15 cm } dy \\,\\exp{\\left[- i \\,q\\ , y/\\hbar\\right]}\\,\\langle p - y/2 | \\hat{o } | p + y/2\\rangle,\\ ] ] in both coordinate and momentum basis , where operators , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , are converted into @xmath7-numbers , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the fundamental property of the weyl transform is that the trace of the product of two operators , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , is given by the phase - space integral of the product of their weyl tranforms @xcite as @xmath12 = h^{-1 }   \\int \\hspace{-.15cm}\\int \\hspace{-.15 cm } dq\\,dp \\,o^w_1(q , p)\\,o^w_2(q , p),\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is planck s constant .",

    "providing a distribution in the phase - space and a representation for the expectation values of quantum observables is not , nevertheless , an exclusive property of the wigner functions .",
    "a similar procedure could be implemented through other function candidates to provide enough information about the quantum systems .",

    "<S> in this work we examine the effect of phase - space noncommutativity on some typically quantum properties such as quantum beating , quantum information , and decoherence . to exemplify these issues </S>",
    "<S> we consider the two - dimensional noncommutative quantum harmonic oscillator whose components behavior we monitor in time . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure allows us to determine how the noncommutative parameters are related to the missing information quantified by the linear quantum entropy and by the mutual information between the relevant hilbert space coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> particular questions concerning the thermodynamic limit of some relevant properties are also discussed in order to evidence the effects of noncommutativity . finally , through an analogy with the zeeman effect , we identify how some aspects of the axial symmetry of the problem suggest the possibility of decoupling the noncommutative quantum perturbations from unperturbed commutative well - known solutions . </S>"
