    "oxide - metal interfaces continue to be studied intensively because of the many ways in which they are of commercial and scientific importance .",
    "applications range from the nanoscale in microelectronics packaging to the macroscale engineering of thermal barrier coatings or the formation of protective scales .",
    "the science of these interfaces has been addressed in volumes of conference papers and reviews @xcite .",
    "there are also reviews in the literature @xcite which specifically address the theoretical questions about the nature of the bonding at these interfaces , such as : what determines the site - preference of metal atoms on the oxide surface ; whether the bonding can be thought of as predominantly covalent or metallic and how to quantify these concepts ; whether a simple classical image model can be used to interpret the bonding ; what is the strength of adhesion of metal to oxide .",
    "the basis for answering these questions is to have reliable calculations of the electronic structure and total energy of particular surfaces and interfaces .",
    "such calculations came of age over the past ten years or so with the use of first - principles methods .",
    "these mainly apply density functional theory ( dft ) and the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite , which are the basis of the calculations we shall report here .",
    "hartree - fock calculations are also feasible and have been applied effectively to the ag / mgo interface  @xcite , although they tend to be more expensive than dft for larger systems .",
    "since the reviews cited , there have been numerous applications of dft to study bonding in the initial stages of deposition of metal on oxide , with cluster or multilayer geometries , notably on mgo  @xcite , but to a lesser extent on more complex oxides such as tio@xmath2 @xcite , mgal@xmath2o@xmath4 @xcite and @xmath12o3 @xcite .",
    "the bonding of nb to @xmath12o3 has long been a subject for experimental work , because besides its relevance to electronic components it offers practical advantages for sample preparation : the two materials bond strongly @xcite ( anomalously strongly according to a recent study  @xcite ) , do not react chemically and have similar coefficients of thermal expansion . in the orientation",
    "nb(111)/2o3 ( 0001 ) there is a lattice mismatch of @xmath5 , allowing the preparation of a nearly coherent interface ( using molecular beam epitaxy ) , the atomic structure of which has been studied by high resolution transmission electron microscopy ( hrtem ) and analysed in detail  @xcite .",
    "this interface was the subject of first - principles calculations which used periodic boundary conditions , making the reasonable assumption that the effect of misfit dislocation can be neglected @xcite . our recent work @xcite analysed the nature of the bonding in detail by calculating mulliken populations and bond orders , concluding that the bonding across the interface is strongly ionic .",
    "the work of separation  of the interface was calculated , and found to be very high : of order 10jm@xmath6 when niobium was bonded to the oxygen terminated 2o3 surface .",
    "lower energy pathways for the cleavage of this interface would be within the nb metal or the oxide itself .",
    "two other interfaces were studied corresponding to the two other possible terminations of bulk 2o3 ( 0001 ) ; namely the stoichiometric , aluminium termination ( one layer of aluminium ) and the aluminium - rich termination ( two layers of aluminium ) .",
    "hrtem could not distinguish between the stoichiometric termination and the oxygen termination , however evidence from electron energy loss spectroscopy @xcite favoured the oxygen termination .",
    "we point out here that as far as we know the question of which termination is more stable has not yet been addressed in all the theoretical work which has been published so far on any oxide - metal interfaces .",
    "the structural predictions have been confined to the question of the relative displacement of the crystals , parallel and perpendicular to the interface , and the local relaxations of atoms at the interface , as well as the energy needed to separate the crystals .",
    "this has been done for interfaces with different terminations or local stoichiometry ; all calculations were carried out with atoms at rest ( @xmath7 ) and minima in the total energy were located as a function of atomic positions .",
    "however , the question as to whether the oxygen terminated or the aluminium terminated interface is more stable was not discussed .",
    "it is well known that this question can only be answered with respect to the chemical potentials of the species in the environment with which the interfaces are in equilibrium , which is normally characterised by temperature and partial pressure of oxygen @xcite , and the difficulty of relating the quantities accessible to a first principles calculation to these parameters may have been a reason for leaving this question to one side .",
    "the main purpose of our present paper is to show how in fact we are already able to make predictions of the stability of different interfaces when they differ not only in structure but also in composition . with certain simplifying assumptions",
    "we show how this can now be done with little more effort than the calculations which need to be done to calculate the work of separation , and we present first results for the nb/2o3 interface .",
    "the ingredients of the theory are the works of adhesion and surface energies .",
    "for these we draw upon the results reported briefly in @xcite , supplemented by some further calculations to discuss the case of oxygen on the nb surface .",
    "the basic theory is outlined in section ii .",
    "we derive the equations for a general @xmath8 oxide in contact with a metal @xmath9 ; it would be a short step to generalise them still further to an interface between arbitrary compounds .",
    "essentially the same thermodynamics was applied by wang _",
    "@xcite in calculations of the surface energy of oxides with different terminations , over a range of chemical potentials of oxygen ; our theory makes the further connection to the temperature and in particular the _ pressure _ of oxygen , which are the parameters directly under the control of the experimentalist .",
    "a detailed study of the 2o3 surface will be reported elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the plan of the rest of the paper is as follows .",
    "sections iii - v cover aspects of our total energy calculations which were not dealt with , or dealt with only briefly , in our letter @xcite . in section",
    "iii our method of total energy calculation is summarised . in section",
    "iv we describe the atomic relaxations _",
    "parallel _ to the interfaces which are generally not commented upon .",
    "although this structural aspect is not central to the thrust of our paper , it turned out that lateral relaxations also have a strong part to play in determining the interplanar relaxations and energies reported previously , and we therefore describe them for completeness . in section",
    "v we describe and comment on the results for the work of separation on different planes and with different terminations of the interface .",
    "our calculated interfacial free energies are presented in section vi and we conclude in section vii .",
    "let us consider the interface between metal @xmath9 and an oxide of metal @xmath10 in equilibrium at temperature and pressure @xmath11 .",
    "the stoichiometric composition of the @xmath10 oxide is @xmath8 .",
    "we obtain the definitions of interfacial quantities by referring to the contents of a periodically repeated supercell of area @xmath12 parallel to the interfaces which it may contain .",
    "all extensive thermodynamic quantitites in the following will refer to the contents of such a supercell .",
    "the interfacial energy per unit area , counting the two interfaces within each supercell , is given by@xcite :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the gibbs energy of the contents of a supercell containing two interfaces , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the chemical potentials of the three components , and @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the numbers of atoms of the three components within the supercell .",
    "the denominator @xmath21 occurs because there are two interfaces in the supercell , as required by periodic boundary conditions .",
    "chemical potentials here are per atom rather than per mole , which would be the usual convention for macroscopic thermodynamics . special cases of eqn .  ( [ gammaint ] ) are when either the metal @xmath9 or the oxide is absent from the supercell , in which cases we recover expressions for the surface energies of the oxide @xmath22 and the metal @xmath23 respectively :    @xmath24    @xmath25    the quantities @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the gibbs energies of slabs of oxide and of metal , with free surfaces separated in their respective supercells by an adequate thickness of vacuum . we have assumed in eqn.([gammab ] ) that the metal surface is clean",
    "; this will suffice for a calculation of the energy of the @xmath28 discussed below .",
    "however , we can easily consider for example adding a monolayer of oxygen to the metal surface in the calculation of @xmath29 . since there is no separate oxide phase , the number of oxygen atoms in the system , @xmath30 , now resides on the metal surface .",
    "the contribution @xmath31 must be subtracted in the calculation of the corresponding surface energy just as in the calculation of the interface energy .",
    "we shall in fact make this calculation of an ` oxidised ' nb surface in the course of obtaining the work of separation of an interface by a pathway which leaves oxygen on the exposed metal surface .",
    "the motivation for calculating @xmath32 is as follows .",
    "an interface between two crystals requires five parameters for its macroscopic specification , for example three to specify the relative crystallographic orientation of the materials and two more to specify the orientation of the interface .",
    "we note in passing that a free surface in contact with vapour or liquid only requires two parameters to specify its crystallographic orientation .",
    "there is always a large set of hypothetical interfaces which have the same five macroscopic parameters but which differ in their atomic structure and local stoichiometry .",
    "the member of this set which minimises @xmath32 for given chemical potentials is the equilibrium interface .",
    "so provided we know the chemical potentials of the components , we could in principle predict the atomistic structure of the equilibrium interface , including its local stoichiometry , by evaluating @xmath32 for each member of the set .",
    "in practice , of course , we can only calculate @xmath32 for a small subset of the entire set , and rely on our experience and intuition , together with experimental information , to ensure that we have not omitted an important structure .",
    "prior to the present work we and others have calculated total energies for a number of structures at 0k , in which the atomic positions are relaxed by energy minimisation .",
    "the equations to be derived below show how to go the two important steps further , namely to correct the 0k information to finite temperature and to take account of local stoichiometry .",
    "the relationship between local stoichiometry and @xmath32 is well known in thermodynamics as the gibbs adsorption equation , in which local stoichiometry is measured in terms of _ excesses _ @xmath33 of one or more components labelled @xmath34 . our final version of eqn .",
    "( [ gammaint ] ) will be in terms of the excess of oxygen at the interface with respect to the metal @xmath10 , per unit surface area , which is defined as :    @xmath35    this choice of component @xmath34 is arbitrary ; we could equally well work in terms of @xmath36 , because they are related through    @xmath37    we note three further points in connection with excesses .",
    "firstly , each further component in the system would introduce another excess , each excess being referred to the same designated component .",
    "secondly , a stoichiometric interface is by definition one for which all the excesses vanish .",
    "finally , since one of the phases is the pure metal @xmath9 , there can be no excess of the metal @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath9 were in fact also @xmath38 , thereby reducing the number of components to two , the interface could not be described as having an excess of @xmath39 or @xmath38 . for more discussion of the thermodynamics of excess quantities the reader",
    "is referred to @xcite .",
    "a difficulty up to now has been to calculate the chemical potentials involved in these equations and , more specifically , to relate them to given experimental conditions . in the following",
    "we show how eqn .",
    "( [ gammaint ] ) can be reformulated to relate @xmath32 to the partial pressure of oxygen @xmath0 .",
    "first we define the _ work of separation _  of the interface .",
    "it does not refer to chemical equilibrium states and therefore does not involve chemical potentials of the separate components :    @xmath40    for brevity we do not explicitly indicate the temperature and pressure dependence of all the terms unless it needs to be emphasised . an important point to note about this quantity , which makes it relatively straightforward to calculate ,",
    "is that the separate slabs of metal and oxide have exactly the same composition as the two slabs which are joined to form an interface",
    ". this would not in general be the case if these slabs and the interface were in equilibrium with a given environment ( constant @xmath41 ) , because one would expect for example some loss or gain of surface oxygen or metal from the oxide to the vapour phase when the surfaces are created . if the interface as well as the exposed surfaces are the ones which are in chemical equilibrium ( which we denote by superfix @xmath42 ) , an equation similar to ( [ wsep ] ) defines the _ work of adhesion _ :    @xmath43    this is the quantity of relevance to contact angles and wetting for example , and unlike  it is not obtainable by a simple comparison of three total energies .",
    "calculations of  for nb/2o3 were reported in our letter@xcite and these have been extended here , as described in the following sections .",
    "is probably more relevant than @xmath44 in formulating a fracture criterion , when internal surfaces are formed which are not in equilibrium , but in order to predict the equilibrium structure of interfaces we also need to be able to evaluate eqns.([gammaint])-([gammab ] ) .",
    "we now introduce the quantity @xmath45 , the gibbs energy per formula unit of bulk   in equilibrium with metal @xmath10 and oxygen in vapour form : @xmath46 so that @xmath47 is the gibbs energy of a stoichiometric cell containing @xmath48 atoms of @xmath10 . inserting ( [ gao ] ) and ( [ excess ] ) into ( [ gammaao ] ) gives the surface energy of the oxide in a form which makes the effect of the excess oxygen explicit : @xmath49    consider now how to go about calculating the two surface energies from ( [ gammab ] ) and ( [ gammaao2 ] ) , which we will eventually combine with  in ( [ wsep ] ) to give us @xmath32 .",
    "the gibbs energy of all slabs can be calculated at @xmath7 and @xmath50 from first principles , it is just the total energy . if the slabs are bulk pure material , their gibbs energy can be corrected to temperature t by using experimental specific heat data . on the other hand when the slabs are separated in the supercell by a layer of vacuum to represent free surfaces ,",
    "there is no such experimental data and the correction to finite @xmath51 could be done by calculating the phonon spectrum and using the quasiharmonic approximation for the free energy .",
    "this has been done previously for classical ionic models by taylor and coworkers@xcite , in order to obtain the temperature dependence of their surface energy , but we have not yet made the equivalent calculation with our _ ab initio _ code .",
    "for a metal slab ( ag ) , the quasiharmonic free energy based on _ ab initio _ phonon frequencies was recently calculated by xie and coworkers@xcite . in the case of the pure metal slab ,",
    "the chemical potential @xmath52 is the gibbs energy per atom of a bulk slab .",
    "the surface energy of @xmath9 is therefore obtained from the results of two supercell total energy calculations in the standard way .",
    "the main present issue , which is less familiar in the context of total energy calculations , is how to calculate the significant term due to the chemical potential of oxygen , which must be included when the surface of the oxide is non - stoichiometric ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the chemical potential of oxygen is well described in terms of its partial pressure @xmath0 by the standard ideal gas expression @xmath54 in eqn .",
    "( [ muo ] ) , @xmath55 is the oxygen chemical potential in its standard state ( stp ) at @xmath56=298.15k , @xmath57=1at .",
    "chemists would set @xmath55 to zero by definition , but we can not do that since our zero of energy is already defined as the energy of separated ions and electrons at @xmath58k .",
    "on the other hand the energy of oxygen molecules is not something we want to calculate , since there are well known problems in using density functional theory for this system .",
    "fortunately , we can circumvent the problem by using a thermodynamic cycle . from the defining equation for the standard gibbs energy of formation",
    "@xmath59 : @xmath60 we obtain the troublesome oxygen chemical potential at stp in terms of @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the quantities @xmath61 and @xmath63 are things we _ can _ calculate accurately , and we can look up @xmath59 in tables of thermodynamic data .",
    "inserting @xmath55 from ( [ deltag ] ) into ( [ muo ] ) and ( [ muo ] ) into ( [ gammaao2 ] ) gives us our final expression for the surface energy of the oxide : @xmath64 from which we obtain the final expression for the interfacial energy by subsituting ( [ gammaao3 ] ) into ( [ wsep ] ) : @xmath65 the quantities @xmath61 and @xmath66 entering the third line of ( [ gammaint2 ] ) are well described by @xmath58k quantities which we calculate .",
    "it can be verified that correcting them to standard state has a negligible effect on the surface energy .",
    "the minimum physically meaningful value of @xmath0 , which we denote @xmath67 , is set by the condition that if @xmath68 the oxide would spontaneously decompose into metal and oxygen .",
    "neglecting the small variation in solid energies with temperature by comparison with @xmath59 this condition is : @xmath69 similarly , the maximum physically meaningful value of @xmath0 is defined by the lowest standard gibbs energy of formation of a metal b oxide @xmath70 : @xmath71 where the first oxide to form would have the stoichiometry @xmath72 .",
    "the thermodynamic data used here are summarised in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "for the interface calculations we use the total energy plane wave pseudopotential method based on lanczos diagonalization of the kohn - sham density matrix@xcite . the supercell has the form of a rhombohedral prism and in the stoichiometric slab it contains 45 atoms : 14 al , 21 o and 10 nb atoms ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) . by stripping off the outer plane of al from each interface we obtain an interface which is o - terminated with an o excess @xmath73 atoms per surface unit cell . by adding the surface plane of al atoms to the neutral interface we make an oxygen poor interface , with the negative o excess @xmath74 .",
    "the total energy of the contents of a supercell is minimized with respect to the atomic coordinates by the quasi - newton method with hessian updated using the broyden - fletcher - goldfarb - shano ( bfgs ) method .",
    "the pseudopotential for nb was of troullier - martins form @xcite , with @xmath75 and @xmath76 non - locality .",
    "the pseudopotential for o was of optimised form @xcite , with @xmath75 non - locality .",
    "the pseudopotential for al was of gonze type @xcite with @xmath75 non - locality .",
    "all calculations were made with two @xmath77-points in the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone , and with a plane - wave cut - off of 40 ry .",
    "the effect of increasing the plane wave cutoff from 40 to 60ry was to reduce  by 3.3% for the nb / al interface , which we take as a satisfactory indication of the basis set convergence .",
    "for the neutral 45 atom interface we have made test calculations with six @xmath77-points which results in a decrease of total energy by about 4mry and very small ( @xmath78 nm ) changes of relaxed positions of atoms compared with two @xmath77-point calculations .",
    "the effect of increasing the @xmath77-point sampling from 2 points to 9 is to change  by less than 1% .    by doubling the original unit cell in the x - y plane we obtained a 180 atom cell , with which we recalculated the wavefunctions at the gamma point with the previously relaxed atomic coordinates .",
    "the gamma point wavefunctions in this cell were used for mulliken population analysis which was made by projecting the optimized wave functions onto the pseudoatomic orbitals @xmath79 ( i labels site , @xmath80 - orbitals ) according to the procedure suggested in@xcite .",
    "the `` spillage '' of each occupied orbital @xmath81 was less than 1.5% .",
    "the slab with which the nb(111)/2o3(0001 ) interface was modelled is shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the interlayer relaxation of the interface has been reported previously@xcite , and we refer to that paper for results . here",
    "we mention a feature which has not previously been discussed , namely the relaxations parallel to the interface , which we refer to as in - plane relaxations . it has been found that to make a calculation of the interlayer relaxation of the alumina surface one needs to take into account the in - plane relaxations of the oxygen atoms@xcite , which were neglected in some earlier work@xcite .",
    "the present results show that in - plane relaxation of the oxygen ions is a general feature of the structure near the interface .",
    "the geometry of these relaxations is described by two parameters ; the rotation @xmath80 and the bond length extension @xmath82 of the equilateral triangle of oxygen atoms in a plane , illustrated in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the rotation and dilation of this equilateral triangle does not break any symmetry , preserving for example the three fold axis about the centre of the triangle concerned .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath80 and @xmath83 are shown in table  [ table2 ] for the terminating and second layer oxygen planes ( denote by subscripts 1 and 2 ) in five cases .",
    "the first two cases , labelled n(b)/a(o ) and n(b)/a(al ) are the o and al terminated bulk nb/2o3 interfaces .",
    "cases three and four are pure alumina surfaces , labelled a(o ) and a(al ) to indicate that they are oxygen and aluminium terminated respectively . case five , labelled n(m)/a(o ) is a nb monolayer on an oxygen terminated alumina surface .",
    "one can see that the in - plane relaxation is a feature of all the systems studied . from the evidence of the first two layers , the rotation of o - triangles and the increase of the o - o bond lengths appears to be localised near the surface of the alumina .",
    "the nb monolayer on the o - terminated surface of alumina shows this effect most strongly , which is quite surprising , since the interplanar relaxation in this case is much less than that of the al layer for which the nb substitutes .",
    "there is experimental confirmation of the effect , obtained by small angle x - ray diffraction@xcite , in the case of the a(al ) surface . in this case",
    "the experimental results are @xmath84 and @xmath85=@xmath86 , compared with our calculated results of @xmath87 and @xmath85=@xmath88 .",
    "the agreement is only qualitative .",
    "all our results for the calculated work of separation  of different interfaces and cleavage planes are shown in table  [ table3 ] .",
    "the column of ` unrelaxed ' results refers to values obtained by assuming bulk unrelaxed atomic positions both at the interface and for the free surfaces .",
    "the interplanar spacing between o and nb across the interface in this case was simply taken as the bulk spacing between o and al planes .",
    "the results in the ` relaxed ' column are calculated with atomic positions relaxed both before and after cleavage .",
    "the effect of relaxations on  naturally depends on the interface .",
    "it is most pronounced when an al terminated 2o3 surface is exposed , because of the large relaxation of this surface , which lowers its surface energy by about 1.5jm@xmath6 . on the other hand , if the relaxation of the _ interface _ dominates the energy balance in eqn.([wsep ] ) then the relaxed value of can even be larger than the unrelaxed value , as in the case of cleavage between nb and o at the n(b)/a(o ) interface .",
    "the lowest value of , 2.7jm@xmath6 , is found for the cleavage of bulk nb from the stoichiometric al - terminated alumina .",
    "the highest values are found for the cleavage of bulk nb from the o - terminated alumina surface .",
    "indeed we can deduce from table  [ table3 ] that this interface would be unlikely to separate between nb and o planes , but would prefer to separate inside the nb , leaving a monolayer of nb on the surface , or even between o and al , leaving a monolayer of o on the nb surface .",
    "the highest value ( relaxed ) of all in table i is for the cleavage of pure 2o3 between o and al planes .",
    "experimentally , @xmath12o3 does not cleave on the basal plane at all , but its lowest energy cleavage on this plane would clearly be between al planes .",
    "this is what one expects on the basis of charge neutrality arguments , because by cleaving between al planes two identical , neutral surfaces are created . on the other hand by cleaving between o and al , different surfaces are created which , in order to be neutral , require the oxygen or aluminium at the surface to be in an unfavourable valence state , hence this is a final state of especially high energy .",
    "the above interpretations are supported by the mulliken populations shown in table  [ table4 ] for the three interfaces between bulk nb and 2o3 .",
    "we make the usual caveat here that mulliken charges do not have absolute significance , since they depend on the choice of basis set , but they are nevertheless a useful indicator of trends in ionicity or covalency .",
    "the interfaces in table iii are labelled by their oxygen excesses , to highlight certain trends with the stoichiometry of the interface .",
    "bulk oxygen carries a mulliken charge of -1 , and for the oxygen plane nearest the interface this value is reduced to -0.99 , -0.93 and -0.86 in turn as the excess of oxygen at the interface is increased from negative to positive .",
    "the change is rather modest , indicating that oxygen does not readily alter its valence state .",
    "the charge on the interfacial oxygen is provided by the terminating layer of al in the case of al termination , or in the case of the oxygen terminated interface the electrons are provided mainly by the first two layers of nb .",
    "five surface energies are shown in fig.[fig3]a as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the x - axis is appropriate to a temperature of 1500k ; to obtain the results at temperature @xmath51 the numbers on the x - axis should be multiplied by @xmath89 .",
    "the o - rich ( @xmath90 ) and o - poor ( @xmath74 ) alumina surfaces have negative and positive slopes respectively , while the stoichiometric 2o3 and pure nb(111 ) surface energies are constant , and by chance nearly equal .",
    "the most negatively sloping surface energy we have plotted here refers to the nb(111 ) surface with an attached monolayer of oxygen .",
    "it becomes negative at an oxygen pressure inside the regime of stability of nbo .",
    "the interfacial free energy from eqn.([gammaint ] ) is shown as a function of @xmath0 in fig.[fig3]c for three interfaces , o - rich , stoichiometric and o - poor ( @xmath91 ) . to generate the interfacial free energies one has to subtract the work of separation shown for convenience in fig.[fig3]b , from the sum of the equilibrium surface energies of the two corresponding free surfaces .",
    "with increasing @xmath0 the o - rich interface becomes increasingly stable , the al - rich interface less stable and the free energy of the stoichiometric interface remains constant , exactly parallel to the behaviour of the free surfaces .",
    "the interfaces can only be in thermodynamic equilibrium in the range of oxygen pressure which is indicated on the figure . at 1500k",
    "this range is as given in table [ table1 ] ; at values of @xmath0 above this range , the nb would oxidise to nbo , and below it the alumina would decompose .    the _ work of adhesion _ at a given @xmath0 can also be estimated from the results on this graph using eqn.([wad ] ) .",
    "the free surface and interface energies should be those with lowest free energy at the given oxygen pressure , and these can be read off from figs.[fig3]a and [ fig3]c .",
    "the result is plotted in fig.[fig3]d .",
    "we have made a careful distinction between work of separation , a mechanically defined quantity , and work of adhesion , a thermodynamic quantity , focusing on how to go about calculating these quantities within an atomistic model .",
    "we particularly consider the interface between a metal and an oxide , since it is of practical importance and since oxygen is a troublesome component for which to calculate the chemical potential , a key quantity in interfacial energies . a useful practical equation for the free energy of an interface involving oxygen has been derived , namely eqn.([wad ] ) , which gets around the previous difficulty by using a thermodynamic cycle to express the result in terms of quantities which can be readily calculated , namely the total energies of slabs , and quantities which can be obtained from tables , namely the standard gibbs energy of formation of the oxide and the gibbs energies of the bulk materials relative to their @xmath58k values .    to illustrate and apply the method we have made a number of first principles calculations for nb(111)/2o3 ( 0001 ) interfaces , oxygen rich , oxygen poor and stoichiometric , and for several surfaces",
    "we fully relax the atomic positions in supercells using a plane wave , pseudopotential methodology .",
    "the relaxations are significant , and in all cases they involve in - plane as well as interlayer relaxations of the oxygen ions .",
    "results on the work of separation of these interfaces were given in a letter@xcite recently , and we have extended them to include the possibility of a cleavage of the o - terminated interface which leaves the nb coated with oxygen .",
    "this turns out indeed to be a lower energy mode of separation ( 4.9jm@xmath6 ) than the alternative which leaves an oxygen rich 2o3 surface behind ( 9.8jm@xmath6 ) , because the favourable degree of ionicity of oxygen is thereby preserved as it is in both bulk alumina and its stoichiometric surface .",
    "considering further the strongly bound o - terminated nb/2o3 interface , it turns out that the hypothetical processes of ( i ) cleavage within bulk nb ( 4.2jm@xmath6 ) , or ( ii ) leaving a monolayer of nb on the oxide surface ( 3.8jm@xmath6 ) , or even ( iii ) cleavage within bulk 2o3 ( 3.9jm@xmath6 ) are all marginally of lower energy than the cleavage which takes oxygen with the niobium .    by combining the results of our calculations with thermodynamic data we obtain surface energies and interfacial energies as a function of oxygen partial pressure and temperature .",
    "an approximation we make here is in omitting the temperature dependence of the solid state free energy , but we include the @xmath92 term which describes the temperature dependence of the oxygen chemical potential ; this is also the term which describes the dependence of all the interfacial and surface free energies on oxygen pressure .",
    "it is clear how a more accurate calculation could be made by implementing the quasiharmonic approximation to correct solid surface free energies , and it will probably become a routine matter to include such a correction in future work . another approximation is made by considering only a small set of possible interface and surface compositions which we think are representative . nevertheless , despite the present simplifications",
    ", some clear results have emerged .    of the free surfaces of 2o3 ,",
    "the stoichiometric one , terminated by a single layer of al , is the most stable over the whole range of oxygen partial pressure up to over one atmosphere .",
    "it may be that a treatment of the temperature dependence of the energy of the slabs could modify the upper and lower bounds on pressure somewhat .",
    "correction of the lda error is also likely to lower surface energies by 10 - 20% ( i. g. batyrev , unpublished ) .",
    "for example , work of c. e. sims _ et al _",
    "@xcite with classical potentials indicates that the surface energies of al - terminated 2o3 can be reduced by up to 0.2 - 0.3 jm@xmath6 at 1500 - 2000k .",
    "we expect an oxygen terminated surface to be stable at a pressure not too far from atmospheric , but we can not unfortunately be more quantitative in the prediction at this stage . at very low oxygen pressures it is also reasonable that the experimentally observed al - rich ( @xmath93 ) structure is stable ; we can not model a supercell of the size needed to calculate this .",
    "instead we modelled a much simpler al - rich interface , which is predicted to become the most stable one just above @xmath67 where 2o3 decomposes . since the experimental @xmath93 is a very al - rich surface ( @xmath94 in the present notation ) , the slope of its surface energy versus @xmath95 is correspondingly very steep and positive , and it must intersect all the other surface energies just above @xmath67 .",
    "the nb free surface should obviously become unstable with respect to some adsorption of oxygen when @xmath96 , the pressure at which nbo begins to form .",
    "the particular configuration and concentration of an oxygen monolayer which we have calculated is not likely to be the optimum configuration of the first oxygen covered nb(111 ) surface , but it does become more stable than the free surface at pressures somewhat above @xmath97 ( fig.[fig3]a ) .    a significant new result is the theoretical analysis of the _ thermodynamic _ stability of the o - terminated interface , the strong bonding of which we discussed above .",
    "no interface is thermodynamically stable above the ( very low ) oxygen pressure at which nbo forms , but over most of the range below this the o - terminated interface is less stable than the al - terminated one ( fig.[fig3]c ) , despite its strong bonding .",
    "in fact at the very lowest pressure of oxygen , as would pertain in the presence of pure aluminium , our prediction is of an al - enriched interface .",
    "the experimental indications from eels@xcite show no evidence for al - nb bonding , and suggest rather the existence of the o - terminated interface . according to our analysis",
    "this could only be marginally in thermodynamic equilibrium if the oxygen pressure is being ` buffered ' by nb / nbo and lies close to @xmath97 , which does not seem unreasonable .",
    "we have not included in our comparison interfaces with a different macroscopic orientation such as the nb(110)/2o3 ( 0001 ) interface  @xcite .",
    "although this interface is believed to be thermodynamically more stable than the nb(111)/2o3 ( 0001 ) interface , the kinetic barrier to changing the macroscopic orientation is presumably much greater than the barriers to changing the local interface structure .    although the formalism has been developed for describing metal - oxide bonding , there are obvious applications to systems in which water or other substances may contaminate surfaces or interfaces .",
    "the comparison of the energetics of interfaces with differing amounts of segregation follows the same lines .",
    "the application of the present formalism using a thermodynamic cycle to avoid the most difficult calculations may be fruitful in other situations in the field of interface chemistry .",
