    "the electronic component of cr carries important physics information . due to their low mass , electrons ( e@xmath1 ) and positrons ( e@xmath2 )",
    "are subject to important energy losses in the interaction with the inter stellar medium , during their trajectory between the sources and earth . for this reason they carry information about the origin and the propagation of cr complementary to the hadronic component . due to their strong energy losses ,",
    "electrons and positrons at high energies are unique probes to study the cr source property in the galactic neighborhood @xcite . + in 2008 ,",
    "the pamela collaboration reported an unexpected _ rise _ in the positron fraction between 1 and 100gev of energy , which is in contrast with the standard expectations from secondary production models@xcite .",
    "this `` positron excess '' has been confirmed by ams-02 in the extended energy range of 0.5 - 500gev @xcite . unlike hadrons",
    ", light cr leptons are subjected to radiative energy losses which limit the range they can travel to distances of @xmath31kpc at @xmath41gev @xcite .",
    "hence the observed positron excess suggests the existence of an unaccounted source of cr leptons , possibly placed near the solar system @xcite , which manifest itself as a distinctive excess in the high - energy positron flux .",
    "extra sources may include either dm particles annihilation / decay or nearby astrophysical sources such as pulsars or old snrs @xcite .",
    "+ for a better understanding of the rise in the positron fraction , the measurement of the separate fluxes of electrons and positrons is needed .",
    "the measurement of the cosmic electrons ( e@xmath1 ) and positrons ( e@xmath2 ) is challenging : charged cosmic rays between 1 gev - 1 tev observed at earth , are made substantially of protons ( @xmath5 ) , helium ( @xmath6 ) and heavy nuclei ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "e@xmath1 and e@xmath2 constitute respectively @xmath01@xmath8 and @xmath9 of the total cr flux . the main challenge in the measurement of the electronic component",
    "is the naturally high background / signal ratio .",
    "the ratio to the main cr component , i.e. protons ( p ) , amounts to e@xmath10/p@xmath1110@xmath12 and e@xmath2/p @xmath010@xmath1310@xmath14 , depending on the energy .",
    "the ams-02 is a large acceptance cosmic ray detector which has been installed during the sts-134 nasa endeavour space shuttle mission in may 2011 on the international space station ( iss ) , where it will collect cosmic rays until the end of the iss operation , currently set to 2024 .",
    "thanks to the long exposure time combined with a large detector acceptance ( @xmath15m@xmath16sr ) , ams is able to study the primary cr fluxes in the energy range gev - tev with unprecedented precision and sensitivity .",
    "+        the main goals of the experiment are the direct search of anti - nuclei and indirect search of dark matter particles through their annihilation into standard particles such as @xmath17 , @xmath18 , or @xmath19-rays @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the ams-02 data are expected to significantly improve our understanding of the cr acceleration and propagation processes in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the measurements of low energy cr fluxes during an entire 11 years solar cycle will also help in the understanding of solar physics and of the propagation of crs in the heliosphere .",
    "+ the core of the instrument - which schematic layout is reported in figure [ fig : detector ] - is a spectrometer , composed of a permanent magnet , which produces a magnetic field with an intensity of 0.14@xmath20 t , and of a tracker ( trk ) constituted by 9 layers of double - sided micro - strip silicon sensors .",
    "the task of the spectrometer is the reconstruction of the trajectory and the measurement of the rigidity ( @xmath21 , momentum / charge ratio ) . above and below the spectrometer",
    "two planes of time of flight counters ( tof ) provide the main trigger of ams-02 and distinguish between up - going and down - going particles . this information combined with the trajectory curvature given by the spectrometer ,",
    "is used to reconstruct the sign of the charge . a transition radiation detector ( trd )",
    "is located at the top of the instrument .",
    "the detector is completed with a ring imaging cherenkov detector ( rich ) and an electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) .",
    "the central part of ams-02 is surrounded by an anti - coincidence system ( acc ) .",
    "the ams-02 detector is described in details in @xcite .",
    "+ in the following the ams s latest results of primary cosmic - ray electron flux and the positron flux will be presented .      in order to obtaine the needed high e / p rejection power , ams-02 uses mainly",
    "three sub detectors : the trd , the ecal and the trk .",
    "trd and ecal are the two key detectors for the lepton - hadron separation .",
    "these detectors allow the rejection of the overwhelming background coming , mainly , by cr protons , and are used to perform the measurement of the leptonic components .",
    "+ the trk is able to detect the crossing points of particles with high accuracy ( @xmath23 in the bending direction and @xmath24 along the non - bending one , for z=1 particles ) . from the crossing",
    "points it is possible to provides the measurement of the particle rigidity .",
    "combining the information about the direction of the particle given by the tof ( down - going or up - going particle ) with the sign of the rigidity is possible to reconstruct the sign of the charge and , hence , distinguish between electrons and positrons .",

    "thank to the high statistic collected by ams , is possible to determinate the spectral indices as a function of energy as show in figure [ fig : spectral_index ] .",
    "this is a new observation and provides important information on the origins of cosmic - ray electrons and positrons .",
    "the data show that the electron flux and the positron flux each require a description beyond a single power - law spectrum .",

    "this demonstrates that the high - energy rise of the positron fraction is due to a hardening of @xmath27 spectrum and not to a softening of the @xmath28 spectrum .",

    "the proposed explanations involve dm annihilation or decay @xcite , production of @xmath18 pairs inside nearby pulsars @xcite , or production of @xmath18 from proton - proton collisions inside old snrs @xcite .",
    "the underlying mechanism can be ascertained by continuing to collect data up to the tev energy region and by measuring the @xmath30 ratio to high energies @xcite . +        it should be also emphasized that the low - energy fluxes are significantly affected by cr transport in the solar wind . in order to interpret the @xmath18 data at @xmath310.5 - 20gev in terms of galactic cr propagation",
    ", the solar modulation effect must be taken into account and properly modeled @xcite . in this respect ,",

    "these data may allow for a substantial progress in the understanding of cr transport in the solar wind .",
    "+        data recorded in the first @xmath0 30 months of mission by the ams experiment have been analyzed and the measurement of the energy spectra of electrons and positrons have been presented .",
    "the observed positron excess may imply a heavy dark matter wimp particle or a new mechanism of acceleration in the pulsars . through the measurement of antiproton to proton ratio and positron fraction to high energies ,",
    "ams has the potential to shed a light on the origin of these observed features , either from exotic sources such as dark matter particles or other astrophysical sources such as pulsars .",
    "furthermore , the simultaneous measurement of e@xmath1 and e@xmath2 has also allowed to study differences of the solar modulation effects which are related only to the charge - sign of the particles .",
    "these new accurate experimental data will be of great relevance to improve the current models of cr propagation in the heliosphere , therefore allowing a deeper understanding of the local interstellar spectrum of cosmic rays .",
