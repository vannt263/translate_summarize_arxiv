    "the joint esa - nasa solar and heliospheric observatory ( _ soho _ ) was launched in late 1995 and began routine operations in april of 1996 . since that time , and by virtue of the unique views offered by the on - board large angle spectrometric coronagraph ( lasco ) instruments , more than 3,000 previously unknown sungrazing and near - sun comets have been discovered in _",

    "s first comet discovery ",
    "kreutz comet c/1996  q2 ( soho )  was made on august 22 , 1998 , by mission team member s.  stezelberger , though the publication of the orbit was not made until the following year @xcite . over the next two years",
    ", several bright comets were detected in _",
    "s lasco cameras by _ soho _ mission team scientists .    with word slowly reaching the broader astronomical community ,",
    "amateur astronomers not affiliated with the _ soho _ mission began to take advantage of _ soho _ data posted publicly to the internet , and began reporting comets in archive data previously overlooked by scientists . by 2000",
    ", approximately two hundred comets had been detected in _",
    "s lasco imagery .",
    "the increasing public awareness of this led directly to the creation of what is now known as the `` sungrazer project ''  the nasa - funded citizen science effort that enables amateur astronomers and enthusiasts worldwide to search for and report comets in _ soho _ data .",
    "this project was curated by d.  biesecker from its inception through 2003 , d.  hammer for part of 2003 , and then by k.  battams from october 2003 to the present time . during this period",

    "c1 , c2 , and c3  designed to observe the solar corona from a distance of 1.130 r@xmath0 ( 1 r@xmath0 = 1 solar radius = 0.00465 au ) in the plane of the sky @xcite .",
    "we note briefly that several comets have been observed by _",
    "soho _ s ultraviolet coronal spectrograph ( uvcs ) ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , and that comets are routinely observed and occasionally discovered in its all - sky solar wind anisotropies ( swan ) lyman - alpha imager ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , these observations and detections are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "lasco s innermost field of view was covered by the internally - occulted fabry - perot interferometer c1 telescope that observed the corona from 1.1 to 3.0 r@xmath0 at 5.6-arcsec / pixel resolution .",
    "no comets were detected by c1 , which was only operational until june 24 1998 , and thus no further mention of the instrument is made here .",
    "the lasco c2 telescope is an externally - occulted coronagraph with a field of view extending from approximately 2.0 to 6.4 r@xmath0 .",
    "images are recorded by a 1024@xmath11024 pixel ccd , with a resolution of 11.9 arcsec / pixel .",
    "nominally , c2 images are recorded using a combination of orange filter and clear polarizer , the specifications of which are detailed in table  [ t : filters ] . other filters available to c2 are clear , blue , deep red , h - alpha and infrared , with polarizers at 0@xmath2 and @xmath360@xmath2 .",

    "prior to _ soho _ s launch , approximately thirty kreutz sungrazers were known .",
    "the group is named for heinrich kreutz who derived the first definitive linkages of very bright comets seen near the sun in the 1800s @xcite . with further kreutz discoveries made in the mid - twentieth century ( c/1945  x1 du toit , c/1963  r1 pereyra , c/1965  s1 ikeya - seki and c/1970  k1 white - ortiz - bolelli )",
    ", the group stood at nine confirmed members until 1979 , when the solwind coronagraph about the usaf p78 - 1/solwind satellite observed the first space - detected comet ",
    "the kreutz group object c/1979  q1 @xcite .",
    "this discovery was followed by an additional eight likely kreutz sungrazing comet detections by the solwind instrument ( including four archival discoveries by r. kracht in 2005 ) before the satellite was destroyed by a planned u.s .",
    "air force exercise in 1985 .",
    "the solar maximum mission ( smm ) coronagraph / polarimeter discovered an additional ten kreutz comets ( e.g. , @xcite ) between 1984 and 1989 .",
    "none of the comets discovered by solwind and smm were ground - observed and were thus likely similar to the brighter kreutz comets observed by _",
    "these objects differ significantly in brightness and , presumably , size from the large ground - observed kreutz of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries . for more detailed discussion of the history of the kreutz group ,",
    "we refer the reader to works such as @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "kreutz comets are characterized by their extremely small perihelion distances of around 12 @xmath4 , high inclinations ( @xmath5 ) , and orbital periods of centuries .",
    "these orbital elements are primarily constrained from historic kreutz observations ; _ soho _ s large pixel sizes and short observing arcs yield highly ambiguous orbits .",
    "orbital elements stated for _",
    "soho_-observed kreutz should be treated with the utmost of caution and skepticism and , in many cases , `` should not be taken at all seriously '' ( marsden , private comm . ) .",
    "this statement applies equally to all other _ soho _ discoveries other than those designated periodic .",
    "the kreutz lightcurves are unusual in that they generally peak in brightness at 1015 @xmath6 and fade interior to this , with an occasional second peak inside of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the comets eventually disappear , often significantly before perihelion , and none of the _ soho_-observed kreutz have been observed to survive perihelion except c/2011  w3 lovejoy . this behavior is interpreted as the total destruction and vaporization of the comet and has been used to estimate initial sizes of less than @xmath8100 m in diameter @xcite .",
    "the smallest kreutz comets detected by _",
    "are likely 510 m in diameter prior to the onset of activity ; it is assumed that smaller objects exist but are below the detection threshold .",
    "unlike all other _ soho_-observed populations , _ soho _ s kreutz comets exhibit diverse morphologies .",
    "we broadly categorize _",
    "soho_-observed kreutz morphologies as follows : stellar ( figure  [ fig : c3_krz]a ) ; tailed ( figure  [ fig : c3_krz]b ) ; and diffuse ( figure  [ fig : c3_krz]c ) .",
    "due to the large pixel scale ( 56 arcsec / pixel ) , c3 kreutz comets rarely cover more than one to four pixels in any given image . consequently , the majority of kreutz observed in lasco c3 are what we would describe as stellar ; that is , very condensed with no apparent tail or diffuse extended coma .",
    "kreutz brighter than approximately m5 tend to exhibit a tail feature in c3 .",
    "the improved 11.9 arcsec / pixel resolution offered by c2 enables a somewhat better qualitative analysis of the morphology .",
    "c2 kreutz will typically span at least two pixels , and frequently as many as five or six . at this resolution",
    ", we routinely observe the objects diffuse coma , and can also better detect tail - like features , even in faint comets .",
    "we also see a broader diversity of morphologies , including : small ( one or two - pixel ) stellar objects with no visible diffusivity or tail - like extension ( figure  [ fig : c2_krz]c ) ; small to large ( @xmath95 pixel ) diffuse objects with no apparent central condensation ( figure  [ fig : c2_krz]d ) ; narrow , needle - like objects with no obvious head or nucleus ( figure  [ fig : c2_krz]b ) ; and classic cometary objects with coma , condensed central nucleus , and short tail ( figure  [ fig : c2_krz]a ) .",
    "while these labels apply generally to all c2-observed kreutz , the morphology often can evolve over time , and frequently overlaps between the categories we have defined .                to date",
    ", there has been no published study dedicated to categorizing _",
    "kreutz comet morphologies .",
    "while a time - consuming task , we feel it would be a potentially informative study . such work could seek to filter out effects from seasonality ( viewing geometry ) and phase angle to produce a better understanding of the diverse apparent morphology of kreutz sungrazers .",
    "as discussed by @xcite _ soho _ kreutz objects are prone to clustering , with one theory being that these are objects recently fragmented from one - another .",
    "however , the density of the kreutz stream and ambiguities in orbit determinations make this a challenging case to definitively argue as there may be many serendipitously timed arrivals . on many occasions of two or more kreutz passages within hours of each other ,",
    "we have noted the morphologies of the two or more presumed siblings to be remarkably different , with a `` small diffuse '' kreutz perhaps accompanying a much larger , condensed object , for example .",
    "figure  [ fig : fragment ] shows the very bright kreutz comet c/2008 k4 ( soho ) trailed by approximately half a degree by the far smaller and fainter c/2008 k5 ( soho ) , in an image recorded on may 23 , 2008 at 14:54 ut .",
    "numerous similar examples exist in the archives in which a bright object is followed or preceded by a very faint object .",
    "however , there also exist a substantial number of equivalently bright pairs of objects reaching perihelion within hours of each other .",
    "these pairs of comets have been studied by @xcite ; this is a subject that would benefit from revisiting with the additional sixteen years of available data .",
    "kreutz - comet discovery rates see significant impacts from the rate of data returned by lasco , and seasonal effects resulting from the viewing geometry of the spacecraft .",
    "figure  [ fig : krz_seasons ] shows the total number of kreutz discoveries in each month of the year for the entire _ soho _ mission , 19962015 . the peaks in april / may / june and october / november / december correspond to the periods in which the geometry is such that the interval of peak brightness occurs in the more sensitive c2 camera .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , this seasonal variation is indicative that the actual rate of kreutz comets is substantially higher than recorded .",
    "the impact of the rate of data returned on _ soho _ kreutz discoveries was considered by @xcite , who made estimates of the approximate number of comets likely `` missed '' due to observing interruptions .",
    "the study found that the rate of kreutz comets reaching perihelion increased from 1996 to 2008 , with a large jump occurring in 20022003 , and that the increase was seen in comets at all sizes .",
    "here we take an alternative approach and look at the rate of comet discovery normalized by the rate of `` useful '' images recorded annually by the spacecraft .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ table_lasco_images ] .",
    "we use the same definition of a useful image as outlined in section  [ sec : disc ]",
    ".    figure  [ fig : krz_rates ] plots the annual discovery rate of kreutz comets per 1000 useful images recorded by both lasco c2 and c3 cameras , as listed in column four of table  [ table_lasco_images ] . over the past 19 years , the lasco instrument has observed approximately three new kreutz comets for every one thousand images returned by the instrument .",
    "1998 shows the highest annual rate , with almost five per one thousand images .",
    "however this number must be treated with caution as the lasco instrument was not operational through late june until late september of that year , which corresponds to the period in which fewer kreutz comets tend to be observed , per figure  [ fig : krz_seasons ] .",
    "thus this number is unfairly biased towards higher discovery rates .",
    "of particular note in figure  [ fig : krz_rates ] is the apparent fall in normalized discovery rates since 2010 , despite a large increase in the total number of comets discovered during this period ( figure  [ fig : all_discoveries ] ) .",
    "the years 2003 through 2010 show a very consistent normalized discovery rate of approximately 3.8 kreutz comets per 1,000 useful images , whereas 2010 to present shows a similarly consistent rate of approximately 2.7 kreutz comets per 1,000 useful images . in most cases ,",
    "the additional comet discoveries since 2011 are extremely faint objects that may only be visible in five to eight consecutive images at the new higher data rate , and thus would have perhaps only been seen in two to four images during the mission s early phase .",
    "it has long been the policy of the sungrazer project that kreutz comets could only be `` confirmed '' ( and thus recorded ) if at least five images of the comet are observed .",
    "this is to ensure that noise and cosmic rays are not falsely identified as comets , and that derived orbits of any objects have at least one hour of observing arc .",
    "lasco c3 is less impacted by the increased data rate as objects discovered and observed in that camera tend to be those that are yet to peak , or have only just peaked in brightness , and thus generally persist for at least a few hours .",
    "kreutz in c2 , however , are often at the end of their life , frequently extremely small and likely vaporizing rapidly , thus five images per hour versus three per hour can have a major impact on their detectability .",
    "two possibilities exist to explain the changes in discovery rates since 2010 : ( 1 ) either the rate of kreutz comets did indeed fall from constant levels in 20032010 to a new constant since 2011 ; or ( 2 ) we have reached a detection threshold based now on the sensitivity of the lasco cameras and not on the rate of incoming comets .",
    "since the number of comets per year has actually increased since 2010 , the only explanation is ( 2 ) .",
    "this implies that as the lasco c2 data rate tended towards infinity , we would not detect appreciably more comets that are physically visible to the cameras at or above the instrument detection threshold .",
    "thus , essentially all kreutz objects that pass through the lasco field of view that are at or above the detection threshold are being discovered , i.e. , the citizen scientists are not overlooking many objects .",
    "as of may 31 , 2016 , 200 members of the meyer - group had been identified , making this the second most populous known comet population . yet despite their relatively high number , meyer - group objects are the least well understood of all _ soho _ groups .",
    "nothing is known of the origins or progenitor(s ) of the group , and due to the low quality astrometry available from _ soho _ , their high - inclination orbit is only approximated .",
    "thus , no reliable estimate of the orbital period is possible .",
    "marsden ( private comm . ) has suggested the latter to be at least decades to centuries , while @xcite equivalently propose a likely large aphelion distance for this group .",
    "all observed members of the meyer group transit lasco c2 , and with limited exceptions are exclusive to that instrument .",
    "thus all discussion of meyer comets in this paper should be assumed to refer to only c2 observations unless stated otherwise .",
    "size estimates for meyer comet are not possible , as all objects appear to survive perihelion so the assumptions made to estimate kreutz sizes ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) are not valid .",
    "furthermore , none have been observed beyond the fields of view of _ soho _ ( few are even seen in _",
    "c3 field of view ) , so no useful constraints on size or activity level can be set at larger heliocentric distances .",
    "morphologically , the meyer comets are almost entirely uniform , exhibiting an identical stellar , condensed appearance .",
    "meyer comets sometimes give the appearance of very slight elongation , but it remains unclear whether this is true elongation or simply an instrumental effect , as stars near the edge of the c2 field of view sometimes exhibit a similar apparent elongation .",
    "an example of a typical meyer - group comet is shown in panel a of figure  [ fig : non_krz_imgs ] .",
    "the brighter members of the group reach approximately m6.5 @xcite , but these are rare , with most objects around m7.58.5 . despite some inherently bright members of the population , none have been observed with any indication of a diffuse coma or obvious tail .",
    "unlike kreutz , marsden and kracht objects , the meyer group shows little temporal clustering @xcite , perhaps implying they are structurally strong and/or have very low activity .",
    "the only notable `` cluster '' of meyer - group comets on record are those of the recent trio , soho-2884 , soho-2886 and soho-2887 .",
    "the former of these was an unusually bright meyer comet ( @xmath8m6.5 ) , observed in both lasco c3 pre - and post - perihelion , as well as in lasco c2 , on march 1 , 2015 .",
    "the other two objects were observed in c2 only on march 5 , 2015 , following almost identical paths as each other and only two hours apart .",
    "this latter pairing constitutes the closest clustering of any meyer group comets on record , and the distance between soho-2884 and 2886/2887 was only exceeded by the pair c/1997 u8 and u9 ( soho ) , which were recorded approximately three days apart . given the low rate of occurrence of meyer comets ( 10 per year on average ) , the close clustering of soho-2886 and 2887 would imply a recent fragmentation event as opposed to an alternate hypothesis of simple coincidence .        the meyer - group discoveries exhibit a small seasonal trend ,",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : meyer_seasons ] , but the effect is not as pronounced as that of the kreutz group .",
    "again , this seasonal effect is due to the viewing geometry of the meyer - group orbits throughout the year , with april / may and october /",
    "november / december offering better geometries .",
    "the meyer - group discovery rate has remained largely commensurate with lasco s data rate throughout the mission .",
    "figure  [ fig : meyer_rates ] shows the number of meyer discoveries per year for every one thousand lasco c2 images recorded .",
    "we do not include lasco c3 observations here as only a limited number of very bright meyer comets have been seen in c3 , and all of those were also observed in c2 .",
    "the somewhat anomalously low rate for 1996 is attributable to that being the first year of operation for the spacecraft , and its limited data return during the relatively meyer - abundant months of january through march of that year .",
    "based upon _",
    "s observations and the lack of any observations at larger heliocentric distances , the implication is that the meyer group is an extremely old and highly - evolved population of largely inert bodies . while we can only speculate upon the origin , it would seem probable that the original fragmentation event leading to this group s formation occurred many revolutions ago . assuming an orbital period of at least a century and many dozens of orbits needed to smooth out arrival times",
    ", this implies an origin at least 10@xmath10 yr ago , perhaps substantially longer . assuming the current rate of @xmath810 comets / orbit holds all the way around the orbit and that meyer comets are comparable in size to 322p / soho  1 ( 150320 m in diameter ; @xcite ) , the original parent need only have been a few kilometers in diameter , e.g. , comparable to typical jupiter - family comets @xcite .",
    "the marsden and kracht groups were originally recognized based on similarities in path across the _ soho _ fields of view of individual objects @xcite .",
    "later , linkages between individual objects within each group were noted and each group s orbits were revised ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and many more ) , resulting in short period , low inclination orbits ( see table  [ table_overview ] ) .",
    "subsequent analysis by @xcite and @xcite showed that both the marsden and kracht groups are likely dynamically related to comet 96p / machholz  1 as part of the larger `` machholz complex . '' according to these investigations , the marsden and kracht groups likely split from 96p some time in the last 8001200 years and have been perturbed into their current orbits by having had slightly different gravitational interactions with jupiter .",
    "interestingly , the marsden and kracht groups currently have smaller perihelion distances and lower inclinations than 96p , but 96p was predicted to reach similarly extreme orbits in the next few centuries ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , well before the marsden and kracht groups were discovered .    like the meyer group , the marsden and kracht comets exhibit nearly identical condensed , stellar appearances ( figure  [ fig : non_krz_imgs]b&c ) . all but one have been seen in c2 , while the brightest are also seen in c3 .",
    "typical 96p family comets reach m78 but the brightest , marsden comet p/1999  j6 = 2004  v9 = 2010  h3 , has reached @xmath8m5 each apparition @xcite .",
    "the marsden and kracht comets are often observed to survive perihelion , and they generally peak in brightness within a few hours of perihelion .",
    "their sizes are unknown , but they are likely larger than the kreutz comets ( e.g. , at least a few 10s of meters in diameter ) since there has been no appreciable fading of the objects definitively seen on multiple apparitions .",
    "we do not show here the detection rates of 96p - family objects , as we feel it not particularly meaningful .",
    "these objects are highly dynamic , with certain individual members seemingly fragmenting between perihelion passages ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and some objects not reappearing on subsequent passages .",
    "furthermore , per the  _ soho _ numbering \" policy of the sungrazer project , some objects are counted two or three times prior to determination of their linkage / periodicity , and then not counted on subsequent passages once they are deemed to be a  known \" object . while each group has seasonal variations in viewing geometry that affect detectability by _",
    "soho _ , all marsden and kracht comets reach perihelion within the fields of view of the coronagraphs throughout the year .",
    "the relatively low number of family members likely dominates the seasonal and annual detection rates .",
    "temporal clustering is frequent among the marsden and kracht comets , with two or more objects in the same family often arriving within days of each other followed by many months without any objects .",
    "this clustering has been interpreted as a sign of ongoing fragmentation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , with comets arriving in a cluster presumed to have split near perihelion on their previous perihelion passage .",
    "the most notable clustering event was the seven kracht - group comets observed may 12 - 15 , 2004 @xcite .",
    "@xcite concluded that the spread in orbital elements of each group is consistent with their having been produced by cascading fragmentation over the last few centuries .",
    "a `` family tree '' of each group ( see , e.g. , figures  4.9 and 4.10 of @xcite ) can plausibly link the known members of each group to just a handful of fragments in the early 1990s .    despite the ongoing production of new group members via fragmentation ,",
    "the overall number of comets in each of the two groups has remained relatively constant over @xmath86 year intervals ( the approximate orbital time for each group ) .",
    "this suggests that the smallest objects are dropping below the detection threshold and/or being destroyed .",
    "thus , we are likely observing these groups at a fortuitous time ; at some point in the relatively near future there are likely to not be any members of either group .",
    "it is possible that there are other groups in the machholz complex that do not yet reach small enough perihelion distances to appear in _ soho _ images , but may evolve into the field of view in the future @xcite .",
    "the 96p family is evidently still evolving .",
    "during 96p s 2012 perihelion passage , two small fragments were observed on a similar trajectory and leading it by several hours .",
    "the fragments bore a remarkably similar appearance to members of the kracht and marsden groups , with no apparent coma or visible tail .",
    "only one of the two fragments could be definitively linked to 96p @xcite due to the low quality astrometric reductions , however there is little doubt that both objects were indeed fragments of 96p .",
    "both fragments appeared to survive perihelion and thus may be detectable during the 2017 perihelion passage , which will again be observed by _",
    "soho _ assuming",
    "the satellite remains in operation .",
    "we collectively refer to all of the comets that are not members of one of the previously discussed families as `` non - group . ''",
    "while this includes a handful of comets that are apparently dynamically related to each other , the majority of the `` non - group '' comets have no relation to any other known objects .",
    "these comets are a mixture of short and long period comets , and some have substantially larger perihelion distances than typical near - sun comets .",
    "due to the lack of relationships between the non - group comets , there are no group properties or discovery statistics to discuss .",
    "we briefly highlight below a few of the most interesting objects , and direct the reader to @xcite for photometry of all non - group comets through 2008 .",
    "the first short period comet to be definitively identified in _",
    "images was 322p / soho  1 ( p/1999  r1 ) , which was recognized by r. kracht @xcite and the orbit definitively determined by @xcite .",
    "it has now been observed on five apparitions and tentatively linked to c/2002  r5 , c/2008  l6 , and c/2008  l7 as members of the `` kracht  ii '' group @xcite .",
    "322p recently became the only short period _",
    "soho_-discovered comet observed beyond the fields of view of solar observatories @xcite ; its inactivity at these distances and peculiar properties have called into question whether it is of traditional cometary or asteroidal origin .",
    "additional confirmed periodic non - group comets in the _ soho _ dataset include 321p / soho  3 ( p/1997  j6 ) which has been seen on a _",
    "soho_-record six apparitions , 323p / soho  2 ( 1999  x3 ) which has been seen on four apparitions , and p/2003  t12 ( soho  7 ) which has been seen three times over four apparitions ( it went unobserved during its 2007 apparition due to poor observing geometry from _ soho _ ) . despite its much larger perihelion distance than typical _ soho_-discovered comets ( @xmath11=0.57 au ) , p/2013  t12 reached extraordinarily high phase angles in stereo - b images during its 2012 apparition , which @xcite used to constrain dust scattering and polarization models .",
    "there have been very few orbits computed for non - group comets since 2010 , making it possible that at least a few additional non - group comets have been re - observed but not yet recognized in the _ soho _ data .",
    "the majority of the non - group comets are on high inclination and apparently long period orbits . however , orbit determinations for these comets are highly ambiguous , often with numerous divergent , unique solutions .",
    "most appear `` stellar '' and are only observed for a few hours , thus little is known about them besides their brightness ( see @xcite ) .",
    "one prominent recent exception was c/2015 d1 ( soho ) which was observed for nearly four days in _ soho _ images .",
    "although it was destroyed during the perihelion passage , enough dust survived that its remnants became the first _ soho_-discovered sunskirting comet ever observed from the ground @xcite .    while it was not discovered by _",
    "soho _ , non",
    "- group comet c/2012  s1 ( ison ) was the most well - studied sungrazing comet in history and , therefore , deserves a brief mention here .",
    "ison was discovered more than a year before perihelion and gained widespread fame because it was the first known dynamically new ( apparently entering the inner solar system for the first time ) comet on a sungrazing orbit .",
    "the long lead time allowed it to be well characterized prior to reaching the _ soho _ fields of view .",
    "unfortunately , ison disintegrated prior to perihelion @xcite and failed to became the naked - eye comet many had hoped for . nonetheless , it was observed far more extensively than any other near - sun comet , resulting in a wealth of unique information .",
    "these include constraints on its nucleus size prior to entering the _ soho _ fields of view @xcite , production rates of water and other volatiles ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , and identification of outbursts of activity that may have resulted in the catastrophic breakup of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "since its launch in 1996 , _ soho _ continues to discover sungrazing and near - sun comets at a consistent and high rate , enabled by the nasa - funded sungrazer project . as of may 31 , 2016 , 3,138 objects have been discovered by the project , primarily ( 86% ) belonging to the kreutz - group of sungrazing comets , with the remaining objects being distributed among the meyer group ( 6% ) , the 96p family ( marsden and kracht groups ; 3% ) , and so - called non - group objects ( 5% ) . in this paper",
    "we have provided a review of _ soho _",
    "s detections and observations of each of these populations .",
    "the rates of discovery of objects in the kreutz and meyer groups , when corrected for the data rate of the spacecraft , have remained largely consistent over at least the past ten to twelve years and suggest that the current discoveries are nearly complete and approaching the limits of instrumental capabilities .",
    "we discussed the diverse morphology of kreutz group objects , recommending this as a focus area of future studies on the population , and showed examples of the rather uniform morphologies exhibited by all members of other groups .",
    "we also discussed the arrival rates of members of the meyer , marsden , and kracht groups , showing that the meyer group is consistent with an evolved population while the marsden and kracht groups continue to fragment .",
    "this ongoing evolution is not restricted to the small comets in the 96p family  96p itself was accompanied by two fragments unseen from the ground during its most recent apparition in 2012 , highlighting the valuable role _",
    "soho _ continues to play for solar system studies after 20 years .",
    "we conclude with a thought experiment to highlight how the studies of small comets by _ soho _ complement work going on elsewhere in the solar system and to link this manuscript with others in these proceedings .",
    "rosetta observations of 67p / churyumov - gerasimenko have shown that , while a low level of activity seems to be nearly uniform across the daytime surface , strong outbursts are generally limited to vertical faces ( @xcite ; @xcite drew a similar conclusion from flyby data of 9p / tempel 1 ) suggesting some localized differences in composition .",
    "surface features are seen on 67p on many scales , from meters to hundreds of meters , that exhibit different physical properties .",
    "for example , figure  [ fig : rosetta_boulders ] shows a number of several - meter class boulders on the surface of 67p that , presumably , are somewhat less volatile than , say , source regions of jets .",
    "if we now place 67p in a hypothetical kreutz - like orbit and fragment the comet , we could hypothesize the current 21 km@xmath12 nucleus @xcite to completely disrupt and form six 1.5-kilometer diameter objects , around 90 0.5-kilometer objects , and approximately one million twenty - meter class objects .",
    "the six large objects would be analogous to the historically brightest members of the group and the 90 intermediate sized objects would be analogous to c/2011 w3 lovejoy .",
    "the smallest objects , about the size of boulders seen on the surface of 67p would be analogous to the @xmath82,700 kreutz comets discovered by _ soho _ thus far . given the likely differences in volatile content between a relatively inert boulder on the surface of 67p and a volatile - rich boulder from its interior , it is likely that our hypothetical kreutz population would exhibit different morphologies and brightening behaviors near the sun .",
    "thus , studies of the various aspects of sungrazing comets of all size can help to piece together the properties of the parent comet , allowing us glimpses of the interior of a comet not possible even with rosetta .",
