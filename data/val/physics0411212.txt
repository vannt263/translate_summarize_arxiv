    "a second - order correlation function is an intensity - intensity correlation function , having information on both photon statistics and dynamics of the light generation process of a light source .",
    "it was first introduced by hanbury brown and twiss in order to measure the angular separation of binary stars  @xcite , and later it was applied to property measurement of various light sources such as measuring the coherence time of thermal light  @xcite , getting information on the nature of scatterers  @xcite and surveying the correlation properties of laser light near laser threshold  @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was used in probing the nonclassical nature of light such as antibunching  @xcite and sub - poissonian photon statistics  @xcite .",
    "much effort has been made in devising a precise and efficient apparatus to measure the second - order correlation function .",
    "the first successful time - resolved measurement was done by using a single detector , a single variable delay generator and a coincident circuit to measure the coherence time of low - pressure gas discharge in a single @xmath0 isotope  @xcite .",
    "this technique has a limitation in getting the correct correlation function near zero time delay due to the imperfectness of the detector such as spurious multiple pulse emission and incapability of detection for a finite amount of time just after detecting real photons .",
    "these effects are referred to as after - pulsing and dead time effects , respectively .    to overcome this limitation ,",
    "a two - detector configuration has been adopted in which a light beam is divided into two parts and two photodetectors are used to record photons arrived at each detector  @xcite . unlike the single - detector configuration , the spuriously emitted photons and dead photons at one detector are completely uncorrelated to the photons detected on the other detector so that the contribution of after - pulsing and dead time effects are equally spread over the entire measurement time .",
    "this allows measurements to be extended down to the zero time delay .",
    "more sophisticated correlators , which made use of multiple time delays , were developed which digitized the time interval between a _ start _ pulse from one photodetector and multiple _ stop _ pulses from the other photodetector at a time  @xcite .",
    "the number of pulse pairs corresponding to a given delay is registered on a corresponding counter and the result is proportional to the second - order correlation function . such a device is called a multi - stop time - to - digital converter ( mstdc ) .",
    "this method is more efficient than previous method owing to the multiple delay generators .",
    "even though a two - detector configuration can effectively remove the artifacts caused by the detector imperfectness , this benefit is true only for a stationary source , the intensity of which is independent of time . since the probability of spurious emissions or losing photons due to the detector dead time depends on the intensity , the measured intensity profile can be greatly distorted for a non - stationary source .",
    "in other words , the spurious emissions or lost photons are not equally spread over the entire measurement time but dependent on time .",
    "this can cause distortion in the second - order correlation measurement .    in the present study",
    ", we have carefully investigated the limitation of the two - detector configuration for non - stationary sources and have devised a systematic way of calibrating the second - order correlation function for the first time to our knowledge . for this study , we have developed a novel second - order correlation measurement system which records all the arrival times of photons detected at start and stop detectors and make use of all the photons detected at the start detector as triggers .",
    "there are no waste of photons at the start detector and thus our system can be much more efficient than mstdc for a light source having a high photon flux and a long coherence time .",
    "a schematic of our second - order correlation measurement system is shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "photons are detected by two avalanche photodiodes ( apds , model spcm - aqr-13 by perkinelmer ) .",
    "one detector ( apd1 ) serves as a start detector while the other ( apd2 ) as a stop detector .",
    "each apd has a dark count rate less than 150 cps and a dead time of about 50 ns and generates electrical pulses whenever the photons are detected with detection efficiency of about 50@xmath1 .",
    "apds are electrically connected to the counter / timing boards ( counter 1 , 2 ) installed in two computers ( computer 1 , 2 ) .",
    "relatively low - cost and commercially available counter / timing boards ( pci-6602 by national instruments ) are used to record the arrival times of the electrical pulses and to store them to the computers .",
    "each board has its own internal clock of 80 mhz so that the time resolution is 12.5ns .",
    "two independent boards installed in separate computers are used to prevent the crosstalks between boards or computers .",
    "the internal clock of each counter / timing board has a limited accuracy and also has a drift of 50 ppm as the surrounding temperature changes .",
    "the accurate frequency of the internal clock in each board has been calibrated by counting the arrival times of reference pulses from function generator(ds345 , stanford research system ) .",
    "the frequency difference between boards is typically several tens of ppm and is accounted for in getting absolute arrival times from the measured ones .        to make the two counters start to count at the same time , an additional control computer ( computer 0 )",
    "is used to generate a trigger signal to simultaneously arm the counters .",
    "it has a board with analog outputs and digital inputs / outputs ( ni6703 , national instruments ) , which can send a ttl signal as a trigger .",
    "all the arrival times of photons detected on both detectors are the relative times with respect to the same origin defined by the trigger .",
    "all the detected photons on one detector therefore can be used as start pulses with respect to those of the other detector .",
    "for this reason , we call our apparatus a _ multi - start multi - stop time - to - digital converter _ ( mmtdc ) compared to the conventional _ multi - stop time - to - digital converter _ ( mstdc )",
    ".    mmtdc makes use of all the photons detected at a start detector whereas the mstdc makes use of a single photon detected at a start detector as a trigger and measures the relative arrival times for a time interval which is several times ( let us say @xmath2 times ) longer than a correlation time @xmath3 of a light source .",
    "it starts over and repeats the next measurement cycle using another single photon detected at the start detector after @xmath4 .",
    "if the incoming photon flux to the start detector is @xmath5 , only one photon out of @xmath6 photons is used in the measurement .",
    "therefore , our mmtdc has an efficiency @xmath7 times higher than that of mstdc .",
    "mmtdc is specially advantageous for a light source which has a high photon flux and long correlation time but has a limited operation time with its second - order correlation signal embedded in a large background .",
    "the microlaser  @xcite was a good example to fit this category .",
    "it had an output photon flux of about 3 mcps and a correlation time of about 10 @xmath8 such that our new method was about 30 times more efficient than that of mstdc .",
    "because of limited oven life time , full time measurement could give a signal - to - noise ratio of about 3 even when mmtdc was used .",
    "we could have obtained a signal - to - noise ratio of only 0.55 if we had used the conventional mstdc method , only to fail to resolve the signal . due to limitation in computer memory ,",
    "the number of arrival times recordable at a time is limited by about one million counts in our mmtdc setup .",
    "to get an enough number of data , measurements should be done in a sequential way .",
    "all computers are connected by ethernet connections in such a way that they can send and receive messages among themselves . the counting computers ( computer 1 and 2 )",
    "send a message to the control computer to notify the end of counting whenever they complete a specified number of counting and recording .",
    "after checking that the control computer has received the message , both counting computers prepare a next measurement .",
    "when the control computer receives the message , it sends triggers to the counting computers to initiate counting again .",
    "the number of sequences is determined so as to get an enough signal - to - noise ratio .    to get the second - order correlation function ,",
    "a histogram is constructed for the time differences between all possible pairs made of one of the photon arrival times at start apd and another one at stop apd . to save calculation time , only the pairs of photons the time difference of which are within a certain time window , typically chosen 10 times larger than the correlation time of the source ,",
    "are included in the calculation .",
    "the second - order correlation function can then be obtained from the normalization of this histogram by the averaged histogram value for much longer delay times than the correlation time .",
    "we have tested our mmtdc system using an extended cavity diode laser ( 2010 m , newport ) operating far above threshold as a test source .",
    "the photon statistics of its output is supposedly poissonian and the second - order correlation function is thus unity for all delay times .",
    "photon flux was 3 mcps for each detector and the number of sequences was 1,000 with 500 kilo counts per sequence .    a correlation function obtained from the photons measured at a _ single _ detector exhibits the effect of detector dead time and after - pulsing .",
    "a figure  [ deadtimedistribution](a ) shows a measured result .",
    "two types of dip below 1 appear and the one near the zero time delay corresponds to the detector dead time .",
    "this can be confirmed from the output pulse shape of apd shown in fig .",
    "[ deadtimedistribution](c ) .",
    "the full width of the pulse was measured to be about 50 ns .",
    "the stop photons following a given start photon within this time window are completely ignored and thus a dip with a depth of unity appears .",
    "another dip is extended to 250 ns and its depth is about 0.25 , which means that the following stop photons are partially ignored with a probability of 25% .",
    "this dip originates from the counter / timing board .",
    "usually counter electronics also have dead times since it takes a finite amount of time to record measured arrival times . in our case , since there is no onboard memory in the counter / timing board , it has to transmit the arrival times to the computer memory through dma ( direct memory access ) .",
    "since the data transfer rate through dma is limited by 100 mbps , some counts can be missed if the time interval between photons is too short to be transferred . the probability to miss a count depends on the time interval between successive photons .",
    "we call this loss of counts the _ dead time effect of the counter _ as an analogy to the detector dead time .    the correlation function obtained from the photons detected at _ two _ detectors is shown in fig .",
    "[ deadtimedistribution](b ) .",
    "the effect of the detector and counter dead time is completely removed and the value of the correlation was very close to unity for all delay times , as expected .",
    "since the number of photon pairs per bin amounted to @xmath9 , the standard deviation from unity was only @xmath10 . utilizing all the photons detected at start detector helped to reduce the background noise greatly .",
    "using our mmtdc second - order correlation measurement system , we have measured the second - order correlation function for a non - stationary light source .",
    "the output beam from an extended cavity diode laser was modulated by an acousto - optic modulator .",
    "the amplitude of a driving rf ( radio frequency ) field to the acousto - optic modulator was sinusoidally modulated using a function generator so that the intensity of the first - order diffracted beam was sinusoidally modulated .",
    "its functional form can be written as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 have the units of count per second for the photon counting measurement . since the response time of aom is measured to be 130 ns , the modulation frequency can be safely set up to 1 mhz . for the present experiments ,",
    "the modulation frequency was set as 100 khz .",
    "the normalized second - order correlation function for a classical source , applied to the intensity of electromagnetic field @xmath14 , is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes a time average .",
    "the second - order correlation function for the sinusoidally modulated source is thus calculated to be @xmath17 figure [ eliminationdip](a ) and ( b ) show measured second - order correlation functions .",
    "mean count rates for individual detectors were about 0.6 mcps and 1000 sequences of measurements were done with each sequence counting 300 kilo counts for each detector .",
    "it took about 1000 seconds including sequencing procedure .",
    "the adjacent points were added up and thus the time resolution was 125 ns .",
    "figure [ eliminationdip](a ) is the second - order correlation function obtained from photons detected at a single detector and thus shows a sharp dip near time delay zero .",
    "the dip results from the dead times of the detector and the counter . on the other hand , fig.[eliminationdip](b ) is obtained from the photons detected on two detectors , apd1 and apd2 .",
    "the central dip is completely eliminated , as in the case of stationary light sources .",
    "the normalized shot noise is only about 0.06% due to the large mean counts per bin of about 2.8 million .",
    "the contrast ratios @xmath18 of single- and two - detector configurations are almost the same .",
    "even though the two - detector configuration can eliminate the detector dead time effect near the zero time delay , the detector dead time still can affect the correlation measurements for non - stationary sources when the detector counting rate becomes comparable to the inverse of the detection dead time .",
    "since the probability to miss photons is dependent on the intensity , the measured time - varying intensity profile can be distorted .",
    "we used photon counting method to measure the time - dependent intensity .",
    "since our mmtdc was based on the photon counting method , we used photon counting technique rather than photo current measurement for a consistent quantitative relation between the intensity profile and the second - order correlation function . in order to obtain enough number of counts per counting bin for intensity measurement , which has to be done in a fashion of single shot measurement , we used a slow intensity modulation frequency of 0.1 hz for a given incoming photon flux of around 1 mhz .",
    "photons were counted for every counting bin of 0.01 sec and the counted numbers were transferred at the end of each bin . since the dead time of the counter occurs when the time interval between successive data transfers is shorter than 250ns , this measurement should be free from the counter dead time effect . at 1 mhz counting rate ,",
    "the mean counts @xmath19 per bin was @xmath20 counts and thus the normalized noise @xmath21 was 0.01 , which means we could resolve an intensity modulation whose contrast was as small as 0.01 .",
    "we repeated the measurement for various mean count rates @xmath13 while keeping the contrast of the intensity @xmath22 constant .",
    "to do so , we fixed the radio frequency field driving the acousto - optic modulator and varied the mean intensity using neutral density filters .",
    "the intensities measured in this way were well fitted by sinusoidal functions as shown in fig .",
    "[ contrastintensity](a ) . the contrast ratio in fig .",
    "[ contrastintensity](a ) is about @xmath23 , which corresponds to the contrast ratio at a mean intensity of 3 mcps in fig .",
    "[ contrastintensity](b ) , where the measured results denoted by circular dots show a linear decrease as the mean count rate increases .",
    "this linear decrease can be explained in terms of the correction factor @xmath24 of the detector which needs to be multiplied by the measured intensity to get an original intensity , @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the original and measured intensities , respectively , in the unit of cps and @xmath28 is the dead time of the detector .",
    "if there exists additional dead times such as the dead time of the counting board , @xmath28 should be replaced with an effective total dead time including all dead times , and this subject will be discussed in details in the next section . for @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which shows that the contrast ratio is modified from @xmath22 to @xmath32 .",
    "note that the unmodified contrast @xmath22 , fixed in the experiment , can be determined from the @xmath33 intercept of a linear fit to the measured contrast ratios and the inclination of the linear fit corresponds to the dead time @xmath28 . in fig[contrastintensity](b ) , we get @xmath34 and @xmath35 56 ns , which is about 10% larger than our initial estimate based on the single - photon pulse shape in fig.[deadtimedistribution](b ) . this discrepancy is due to the finite bin size of 12.5 ns , which results in an additional broadening of about 6 ns , a half of the bin size , in the effect of the detector dead time in the correlation function .",

    "[ g2contrast ] indicates the expected contrast with @xmath41 ns .    using mmtdc , we have measured the second - order correlation function under the condition identical to the one under which we had measured the intensity except for the intensity modulation frequency , which is now set at 100khz , since the correlation measurement need not be done in a single - shot fashion as in the intensity measurement .",
    "the square dots in fig .",
    "[ g2contrast ] are the contrasts obtained by fitting the measured @xmath36 with a sinusoidal function .",
    "it decreases linearly as the photon flux increases , but the decreasing rate of the contrast ratio is 1.54 times larger than that expected from the intensity measurement .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the dead time of the counter / timing board , which was absent in the preceding intensity measurement performed at 0.1 hz modulation frequency with a data transfer rate of 100hz . in the second - order correlation measurement , regardless of the modulation frequency , since all of the arrival times are recorded , the data transfer rate can be much faster than the inverse of 250 ns , which is the maximum dead time of the counter . when the time difference of two successive photons is shorter than 250 ns , there exists a finite chance that the following photon is ignored .",
    "a complexity arises since this chance is not alway unity",
    ". it can be anywhere between 0 and 1 .",
    "we thus need to find an effective dead time which can properly includes both detector and counter dead time effects .",
    "to understand the dead time effect of counter , we numerically simulated the effect of a partial dead time .",
    "a poissonian light source was simulated using a random number generation algorithm . in the simulation , if the time difference between two successive photons are shorter than 50 ns , the following photon is omitted with a probability @xmath42 of 50% . this probability would be unity for the case of the detector dead time .",
    "figure  [ partialdeadtime](a ) is the second - order correlation function of this simulated source and shows a dip with a half width the same as the dead time and a depth equal to @xmath42 , 50% .",
    "the correction factor @xmath24 is calculated as a function of the mean intensity and shown in fig .",
    "[ partialdeadtime](b ) .",
    "the result can be well fitted by the following relation . @xmath43",
    "note that the linearity coefficient in @xmath24 with respect to the intensity is not @xmath28 as in eq .",
    "( [ correctionfactor ] ) but @xmath44 .",
    "we can generalize this observation and expect that the detector dead time @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ g2-contrast ] ) will be replaced by @xmath45 . this expectation has been confirmed by our numerical simulations .",
    "therefore , we call @xmath46 an effective dead time and it is equal to the area of the dip ( @xmath47 only ) around the origin in the second - order correlation function obtained in the single - detector configuration ( fig .  [ partialdeadtime](a ) ) . in general , we can experimentally determine the effective dead time @xmath48 of an entire detection system from the dead time distribution , _",
    "i.e. _ , the shape of the second - order correlation function around the origin , calculated with photons detected on a single detector only .        the dead time distribution of our mmtdc system is shown in fig .",

    "the total area of the dip near the origin is 80 ns , which is our effective dead time @xmath49 for the entire measurement system .",
    "the area of the central dip only equals @xmath28=55 ns , originating from the detector dead time .",
    "the ratio @xmath50 is 1.45 , and thus we expect that the inclination of the observed contrast in @xmath36 with respect to the counting rate @xmath13 would be 1.45 times greater than that expected from the intensity measurement free from the counter dead time effect .",
    "this is what we have observed in fig[g2contrast ] , where the observed ratio is 1.54 , showing only 6% discrepancy from our expectation .    from these observations",
    ", we can establish a calibration method for the second - order correlation function of a non - stationary light source .",

    "the second - order correlation function is then measured again , but this time in the two detector configuration . since the correction factor in eq .",
