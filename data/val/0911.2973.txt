    "assemblies of dense granular materials behave unlike usual materials .",
    "one may think that a liquid phase is absent for granular assemblies since they lack attractive interaction .",
    "indeed , the gas kinetic theory such as the boltzmann - enskog theory has historically been employed in describing dense granular flows , where correlation effects appear only through the contact value of the radial distribution function.@xcite this approach is powerful and semi - quantitatively accurate even for considerably dense systems . in these days , however , we have recognized the relevancy of the concept of  granular liquids \" because correlation effects in granular flows , such as long - time correlations and long - range correlations , turned out to be relevant as in molecular liquids.@xcite    there have been some developments in the granular liquid theory starting from microscopic basic equations such as the liouville equation .",
    "the liouville equation of granular fluids was first discussed by schofield and oppenheim@xcite long time ago , and brey _",
    "et al._@xcite further developed such a formulation .",
    "recently , dufty et al.@xcite discussed in detail the green - kubo formula of freely cooling granular gases starting from the liouville equation .",
    "the green - kubo formula for granular fluids has been discussed in various contexts@xcite , and these studies suggest that some correction terms to the conventional green - kubo formula are necessary for granular fluids .",
    "there is an advantage in using the liquid theory .",
    "it is known that liquid theories such as the mode - coupling theory ( mct ) for supercooled liquids are commonly used to describe the glass transition of molecular liquids or colloidal assemblies.@xcite liu and nagel@xcite proposed that the jamming transition is a fundamental transition in glassy and granular materials . since",
    "then many aspects of similarities between the conventional glass transition and the jamming transition have been investigated @xcite , where some researchers have used granular materials to study dynamical heterogeneity in glassy materials .",
    "@xcite along this line it appears natural to apply a liquid theory to dense granular assemblies .",
    "nevertheless , the jamming transition under a plane shear exhibits some distinct aspects from conventional glass transitions , e.g. , the jamming transition depends strongly on details of microscopic interactions between particles .",
    "in fact , one can not use a naive mct  @xcite in describing sheared jamming transitions . instead",
    ", the jamming transition of frictionless granular particles is believed to be a continuous transition at a critical density above which elastic moduli and the yield stress become nonzero , and there are scaling laws in the vicinity of the critical point as observed in conventional critical phenomena .",
    "@xcite    quite recently , chong and kim@xcite have reformulated the liquid theory of sheared dense molecular liquids with the gaussian thermostat .",
    "later , chong et al.@xcite extended their formulation to soft granular liquids under a plane shear , and found the existence of the generalized green - kubo formula and integral fluctuation theorem .",
    "chong et al.@xcite have further developed an mct for uniformly sheared granular liquids .",
    "this generalized green - kubo formula applies not only to linear regime but also to nonequilibrium states arbitrarily far from equilibrium .",
    "thus , one can avoid the use of hydrodynamic equations including burnett and super - burnett terms which occasionally exhibit a divergent behavior .",
    "the aim of this paper is to outline our formulation of the liquid theory for dense sheared granular materials . in the next section ,",
    "we summarize the microscopic starting equations , such as sllod equations , liouville equations , and nonequilibrium distribution function . in section iii",
    ", we present the transient time correlation function formalism and discuss steady state properties .",
    "we then derive the generalized green - kubo formula .",
    "it is demonstrated that the generalized green - kubo formula yields the nonequilibrium steady - state average which is essentially independent of the specific choice of the initial condition . in section iv",
    ", we outline the liquid theory beyond the generalized green - kubo formula , and discuss its connection to the fluctuating hydrodynamics .",
    "the paper is summarized in section v.",
    "in this section , we derive exact microscopic equations and relations which serve a basis in constructing a nonequilibrium liquid theory for uniformly sheared frictionless granular particles .",

    "we assume that each granular particle is a soft - sphere , and the contact force acts only on the normal direction . under a homogeneous shear ,",

    "this means that the sllod equations are equivalent to the newtonian equation of motion under the lees - edwards boundary condition .",
    "@xcite we also note that frictionless sheared granular particles under a constant pressure boundary behave as those under the lees - edwards boundary condition in the vicinity the jamming transition.@xcite on the other hand , it is hard to extract physical essences from actual frictional granular assemblies under a physical boundary condition . thus , a set of sllod equations is a natural starting point in constructing a liquid theory of granular particles .",
    "we also notice that a granular flow on an inclined slope can be approximately described by a uniformly sheared flow except for the boundary layers.@xcite    we stress that an energy sink term is necessary even for a system of a sheared molecular liquid .",
    "indeed , the system heats up without the energy sink . in simulations ,",
    "one usually introduces a thermostat , and an experimental apparatus for the real system plays a role of the thermostat .",
    "we have already confirmed that behaviors of uniformly sheared granular liquids with small inelasticity are almost the same as those for a model of a molecular liquid with a velocity rescaling thermostat.@xcite    we have assumed that the interaction between granular particles is described by a soft - core model , which differs from most of the conventional treatment of the granular gas kinetic theory and the mct for sheared granular liquids where a hard - core model is adopted.@xcite the soft - core model has several advantages : ( i ) the model is more realistic than the hard - core model , ( ii ) one can apply this formulation to very dense systems even in the vicinity of the jamming transition , and ( iii ) one can avoid the use of the pseudo - liouvillian .      for nonequilibrium systems described by the sllod equations , the liouville equation is commonly used .",

    "now , let us compare our formulation with previous formulations of the green - kubo formula for granular fluids.@xcite we first stress that our formulation is unique in that it applies to a nonequilibrium steady state of uniformly sheared granular liquids , while the previous ones deal with the green - kubo formula for granular gases in a freely cooling state .",
    "we also note that green - kubo formula in the previous studies is the linear response theory to a nonequilibrium `` steady state '' ( which includes a homogeneous cooling state ) , but our method is a nonlinear response theory to the initial canonical state . in practice",
    ", the application of the linear response theory to freely cooling granular gases has some technical problems ; ( i ) one can not take the @xmath137 limit of the integral of the time - correlation function because the granular particles quickly lose their kinetic energy , ( ii ) thus the behavior of the steady state strongly depends on the cut - off time of the integration , and ( iii ) the determination of a nonequilibrium steady distribution is difficult .",
    "let us also notice that that freely cooling states can not be realized in experiments .",
    "on the other hand , our method which is the nonlinear response theory to the initial canonical distribution has several advantages such as ( i ) the steady state under a uniform shear can be approximately realized in many situations , and ( ii ) the steady state is almost independent of the choice of the initial condition , although our method can not be generalized to a response theory to a reference state .",
    "nevertheless , it is remarkable that the green - kubo formula for freely cooling granular gases has a similar structure to our generalized green - kubo formula . indeed , eq .",
    "( 139 ) in ref.@xcite is the essentially same as eq.([eq : ss - average ] ) where their expression corresponds to the integral @xmath182 \\rangle$ ] in our context .",
    "this paper summarizes our recent studies on the granular liquid theory under the uniform shear .",
    "we demonstrated that there exists the generalized green - kubo formula in sheared granular liquids .",
    "we also showed that it yields the nonequilibrium steady - state average which is essentially independent of a specific choice of the initial condition .",
    "it should be noted that our formulation does not rely on the presence of the steady distribution function which is hard to obtain , but any averaged quantity in the steady state can be obtained under the simple initial condition . in the previous section ,",
    "we outlined how we can apply our formulation to characterize the behaviors of granular liquids .",
    "one of the most important conclusions in this paper is that the granular liquid theory starting from the liouville equation reduces to the fluctuating hydrodynamics if one considers a weak - shear and elastic limit along with the markovian approximation .",
    "thus , this paper provides a microscopic support of the fluctuating hydrodynamics which is known to give accurate results of the time correlations and the spatial correlations .",
    "we have skipped detailed derivation of mori - type generalized langevin equation and mct .",
    "this will be discussed in another paper.@xcite we also note that we can derive the integral fluctuation theorem along the same line , though there is no microscopic time reversal symmetry .",
