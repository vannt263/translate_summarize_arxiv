    "when a system phase - separates , it pays for the different domains with a surface energy , which is usually negligible with respect to the bulk energy . as a consequence , any non concave region in the entropy",
    "vs energy curve has to be replaced by a straight line .",
    "this is the result of the usual maxwell construction .",
    "however , the condition of negligible surface energy is violated in presence of long range interactions , as well as for systems with a small number of components . in both cases ,",
    "the possibility of non concave entropies and ensemble inequivalence is well known , and has been demonstrated on numerous models , for instance  @xcite .",
    "the same condition of negligible surface energy is also violated on sparse random graphs : despite the fact that each site has only a small number of neighbors , there will be in general an extensive number of links between two ( extensive ) subsets of the system .",
    "the possibility of ensemble inequivalence in this type of models has been alluded to in some works related to the statistical physics of random graphs and combinatorial optimization  @xcite . however , these authors study the analog of the canonical ensemble , and replace the non concave part of the entropy by a straight line . this phenomenon remains thus to our knowledge unstudied , despite the widespread current interest in complex interaction structures , and networks in general .",
    "the purpose of this work is to present a simple , exactly solvable model on a random regular network , that displays a non concave entropy and ensemble inequivalence .",
    "this is a first step towards the study of more complicated networks , which may also include some local structure , like small world networks .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : analytical ] , we present the model , and give its analytical solution ; we then turn in section  [ sec : numerical ] to the comparison with microcanonical simulations using both creutz  @xcite microcanonical dynamics and metropolis  @xcite canonical simulations .",
