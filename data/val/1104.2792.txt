    "rayleigh - bnard convection , the buoyancy - driven flow of a fluid heated from below and cooled from above , is a fundamental paradigm of complex nonlinear dynamics , pattern formation , and turbulence .",
    "an ongoing challenge for analysis , theory , computation , and experiment is to ascertain how the heat transport depends on the thermal forcing as gauged by a nondimensional rayleigh number and the fluid s material properties ( typically the prandtl number , the ratio of kinematic viscosity to thermal diffusivity ) @xcite . rigorous bounds on heat transport in rayleigh - bnard convection within the boussinesq approximation were pioneered by howard @xcite and subsequently elaborated by busse @xcite .",
    "later , following the motivational work of hopf @xcite , an alternative variational framework for bounds on turbulent transport of momentum , mass , and in the case of rayleigh - bnard convection , heat , known as the ` background method ' was formulated @xcite .",
    "this is the approach we adopt here .    in this paper",
    "we consider an infinite prandtl number boussinesq fluid contained between two rigid isothermal boundaries thermally driven by constant internal heating .",
    "this model is inspired by convection in the earth s mantle where the prandtl number is @xmath3 and the motion is predominantly driven by a semi - uniform heating from radioactive decay . for definiteness",
    "we consider an isoviscous fluid subject to no - slip isothermal vertical boundary conditions ( without loss of generality @xmath4 on the boundaries ) with uniform heating in the bulk , an idealization of the actual geophysical conditions . at low heating rates as measured by the dimensionless ` heat rayleigh number ' @xmath2 , the fluid remains at rest and heat is transported to the boundaries by conduction with a parabolic temperature profile across the layer . at high @xmath2 convection sets in ,",
    "increasing the effective thermal conductivity of the layer and consequently lowering the bulk averaged temperature .",
    "the enhancement of heat transport is indicated by @xmath0 , the ratio of the bulk averaged temperature to that of the parabolic profile resulting from conduction alone .",
    "the challenge is to determine how @xmath0 varies with @xmath2 .",
    "the no - convection conduction solution exists ( be it stable or unstable ) for all @xmath2 and realizes the upper limit on the bulk averaged temperature , @xmath5 . at high @xmath2",
    "the question is , how low can @xmath0 go ?",
    "this problem was previously considerd by lu _",
    "@xcite who used estimates originally derived for boundary driven convection @xcite and a simple piecewise linear background profile to produce a lower bound on the space and time averaged temperature relative to that of the conduction state .",
    "that result was @xmath6 because @xmath7 , this is not inconsistent with a scaling law measured from direct numerical simulations @xcite suggesting that @xmath8 we note , however , that those computations employed ` free - slip ' boundary conditions on the velocity field rather than the no - slip conditions employed in the analysis .",
    "boundary conditions for traditional rayleigh benard convection can drastically affect the dynamics so the comparison must be taken with a degree of caution .",
    "more recent developments @xcite indicate that background profiles including some stable stratification in the bulk may be optimal for infinite prandtl number convection suggesting room for improvement for rigorous results . in particular , a singular integral analysis was performed to obtain a key estimate that was then utilized in the background method to produce an upper bound on the nusselt number @xmath9 , the dimensionless measure of the enhancement of heat transport in boundary - driven rayleigh - bnard convection , in terms of the traditional rayleigh number @xmath10 of the form @xmath11^{1/3}$ ] @xcite . here",
    "we show that that key estimate is in fact a modified hardy - rellich inequality and we derive the sharp prefactor .",
    "the newly derived inequality is then applied to the internal heating problem via the background method and , along with some additional considerations , we prove @xmath12    the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section describes the boussinesq equations of motion with internal heating and provides an outline of the background method applied to the problem .",
    "section iii introduces the particular background temperature field as a logarithmic perturbation of a quadratic profile and applies the modified hardy - rellich estimate to obtain the bound .",
    "section iv discusses these results and briefly remarks on the parallels between the internal heating and boundary driven convection problems .",
    "the new derivation of the hardy - rellich inequality is described in the appendix .",
    "in non - dimensional variables the boussinesq approximation of the navier - stokes equations with a constant internal heat source is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the velocity field , @xmath15 is the temperature field @xcite .",
    "the heat rayleigh number is @xmath2 and @xmath16 is the prandtl number .",
    "we consider periodic horizontal boundary conditions in all variables with no - slip conditions ( @xmath17 ) at the bottom ( @xmath18 ) and top ( @xmath19 ) of the box .",
    "combined with the incompressibility condition , this implies that @xmath20 at the top and bottom boundaries as well . for definiteness",
    "we choose the special case where the boundary temperature is isothermal : @xmath21    defining the space - time average of a function @xmath22 as @xmath23 ( assuming that the limits exist ) we are interested in obtaining a lower bound on the average temperature @xmath24 in terms of the rayleigh heat number @xmath2 .",
    "we focus on the infinite @xmath16 limit of , the rigorous validity of which has recently been established @xcite , so that the navier - stokes equations become the stokes equations @xmath25    to apply the background method , break the temperature field up into a background profile and fluctuations according to @xmath26 where @xmath27 leaving the fluctuation @xmath28 to satisfy homogeneous dirichlet conditions at the top and bottom boundaries as well .",
    "applying this decomposition to the equations of motion and considering the space time average of both the momentum and properly weighted temperature equations we arrive at the following bound on the average temperature ( see @xcite for details of the derivation ) : @xmath29 as long as the quadratic ( in @xmath30 ) functional @xmath31 is positive semidefinite among and temperature fluctuations and velocity fields satisfying the boundary conditions .",

    "previous analysis of this problem and boundary driven convection considered background profiles @xmath53 constant in the bulk of the layer so the only possible negative contribution to @xmath32 relied on the product of @xmath50 and @xmath49 in boundary layers where both are constrained to be relatively small in magnitude .",
    "as was shown for boundary driven convection , however , a stably stratified ( i.e. @xmath54 ) profile in the bulk can be exploited to utilize the positive weighted correlation between @xmath33 and @xmath30 resulting from the slaving and improve the positivity of @xmath32 , allowing for sharper estimates @xcite .",

    "the logarithmic term enhances the positivity of @xmath32 , and hence leads to an improved scaling of the boundary layer with @xmath59 , while the quadratic term is meant to increase the integral of @xmath53 sufficiently to offset the slow logarithmic growth near @xmath18 and lessening the negative impact of the dirichlet integral in .",

    "an appropriate choice of the scaling of the parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 with respect to @xmath61 will allow us to determine both the ` correct ' boundary layer scaling , and to maximize the lower bound on @xmath24 .",
    "the two key inequalities required for the analysis are @xmath62 the first inequality ( [ new_estimate ] ) is an exercise in integration by parts the details of which are left to the reader .",

    "while a prefactor improvement may be considered minor , our approach to prove it is simplified significantly and embeds the problem in the familiar context of a generalized hardy - rellich inequality .",

    "but this costs dearly in the computation of the dirichlet integral that negatively affects the estimate of @xmath93 while adding very little to the computation of @xmath94 .",
    "that is , while the quadratic term ( @xmath95 ) thins the boundary layer , it also contributes significantly to @xmath96 and raises the lower bound .    in previous applications of the background method @xcite",
