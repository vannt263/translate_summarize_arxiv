    "in this work , the first one in a series of two papers on transport equations , we present a new formalism for the time evolution of one - particle distribution functions which allows the inclusion of many - body correlations . in the second paper",
    "we derive the transport equations for an electron - phonon system and compare the numerical results with the exact solutions of one - dimensional models ( polaron model , tomonaga - luttinger model )",
    ".    very often non - equilibrium phenomena in quantum many - particle systems are studied by the use of real - time green s function techniques ( martin and schwinger @xcite , kadanoff and baym @xcite , keldysh @xcite , langreth and wilkins @xcite ) . for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite . in the keldysh formalism",
    "the perturbative expansion uses a time integration over a path in the complex plane .",
    "if only interested in the one - particle distribution function , one usually applies the generalized kadanoff - baym ansatz @xcite , which was justified by schoeller @xcite as a partial resummation in the diagrammatic expansion .",
    "the transport equation obtained in the born approximation is of the form of a non - markovian boltzmann equation with renormalized one - particle propagators , usually taken the same as in equilibrium . in ref .",
    "@xcite initial correlations are also discussed , but it does not seem to be possible to apply the same resummation method including the initial correlations .",
    "this stems from the fact that the correlations are not taken into account as time - dependent quantities .    motivated by the work of schoeller",
    ", we present a method which enables the inclusion of the correlations as dynamical quantities .",
    "only single - time expectation values of operators are considered in contrast to green s function techniques . in the course of this work ( cf .",
    "part ii ) it will become clear that the transport equations with correlations already include the renormalization of one - particle propagators in the dynamics .",
    "there is no need to calculate retarded and advanced green s functions independently of the distribution functions .    as the dynamics of all quantities",
    "is just given by the hamiltonian in the form of an equation of motion ( eom ) ( schrdinger or von - neumann equation ) , it seems to be more natural to consider only single - time quantities .",
    "the problem to be solved is how to cut off the infinite hierarchy of equations of motion in a consistent way .",
    "it will be shown that the expansion of the expectation values of many - body operators in terms of correlations ( or , diagrammatically speaking , `` connected parts '' ) allows a systematic decoupling of the hierarchy at any given order . the lowest order ( almost ) agrees with the usual decoupling procedure to obtain the born approximation .",
    "in this section the method will be explained for a fermionic system with two - particle interaction in time - dependent external fields described by the hamiltonian @xmath1 the fermionic annihilation and creation operators are denoted by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the index @xmath4 referring to the one - particle states . in the interaction term",
    "@xmath5 the matrix elements @xmath6 are supposed to be anti - symmetric in the first and second pair of indices ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the external fields are described by the time - dependent hermitian matrix @xmath8 .",
    "sometimes we use the notation @xmath9 for the one - particle hamiltonian matrix .",
    "the method is not restricted to this type of systems .",
    "it may as well be applied to systems with bosons , even with `` anomalous '' ( i.e.  not conserving the particle number ) expectation values like @xmath10 .",
    "the necessary small alterations are mentioned from time to time in this presentation and in part ii the method is applied to an electron - phonon system .    throughout this work we use the heisenberg representation , so that the following equation of motion for operators holds : @xmath11 ( t ) = - i [ a , v ] ( t ) \\quad.\\ ] ] for the case of an operator @xmath12 and the hamiltonian of eq .",

    "( the heisenberg representation of an operator is supposed to be such that @xmath18 . ) for our method to work @xmath15 does not have to be of any special form . as the case of a non - diagonal one - particle matrix @xmath19 is notationally cumbersome , but does not pose any additional problems in the derivation of the kinetic equations , we will carry out the derivation for the case of a diagonal one - particle hamiltonian , adding the necessary alterations for non - vanishing external fields in the end .",
    "thus , given the initial state @xmath15 ( mixed or pure ) at time @xmath16 , we have to solve an infinite hierarchy of ordinary differential equations ( ode ) .",
    "of course , this is usually not feasible and some kind of decoupling procedure is needed . starting with one - particle expectation values @xmath20",
    "the eom involve expectation values of two - particle operators . in the equation of these quantities",
    "the `` collision term '' ( the right hand side ( rhs ) of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom ] ) ) is often approximated by factorizing all expectation values into products of one - particle expectation values as if the wick theorem holds for an arbitrary state of the system . in this way a non - markovian boltzmann equation in born approximation is obtained .    in this work we present a method to extend this procedure beyond the born approximation .",
    "it yields again an infinite hierarchy of eom , which is still exact , but now in terms of correlations .",
    "in contrast to the usual hierarchy of eom mentioned above , this hierarchy allows the decoupling at any given order without any ambiguities .",
    "the essential ingredient is the following cluster expansion @xcite of products of field operators , i.e.  creation and annihilation operators , denoted by @xmath21 : @xmath22 the @xmath23-th order correlations @xmath24 are defined recursively .",
    "the operators need not be normal - ordered .",
    "every expectation value @xmath25 is decomposed into sums over products of correlations in the following way : the sum extends over all disjoint partitions of the set @xmath26 . the product is taken over the correlations corresponding to each subset in the partition . inside each correlation",
    "the order of the field operators is retained .",
    "the overall sign of the product is determined by the sign of the permutation of fermionic field operators necessary to disentangle overlapping correlations .",
    "as we assume that the initial statistical operator as well as the hamiltonian conserve the total number of fermions , only correlations with an equal number of fermionic creation and annihilation operators occur . because of this property",
    "the sign of each decomposition into correlations is well defined .",
    "so far , the cluster expansion has been written down for both , fermionic and bosonic operators . for fermionic systems",
    "the particle number must be conserved and the usual rules for permutations of fermionic operators apply .",
    "the one - particle correlations coincide with the corresponding distribution functions @xmath27 and the two - particle correlations @xmath28 , for example , are defined by @xmath29 from the canonical anti - commutation rules it follows immediately that @xmath30 in all higher - order correlations the fermionic operators anti - commute , i.e. @xmath31 which can be easily proved by induction . therefore , it is sufficient to consider the following anti - normal ordered correlations : @xmath32 we will call the one - particle correlations ( @xmath33 ) contractions .",
    "any expectation value of the form @xmath34 can be expressed in terms of correlations as can be seen directly from the definition of the correlations in eq .",

    "this enables us to transform the infinite hierarchy of eom into an equivalent one in terms of correlations .",
    "so far , nothing seems to be gained .",

    "an _ external _ vertex ( fig .  [ fig : ext_vertex ] ) represents a single creation or annihilation operator .    2 .",

    "then , the overall sign is given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the number of fermionic loops in the deformed diagrams in which the paired external vertices coincide and @xmath95 is the sign of the permutation normal - ordering the external pairs .",

    "since the correlations are ( except for the sign ) independent of the relative order of the creation and annihilation operators , the two terms differ only in the contributions of the contractions .",

    "( [ eq:2parteom ] ) ) : @xmath106    the diagrammatic rules for the correlations are the same as those for the corresponding @xmath49-point functions except that only connected diagrams must be considered ( linked cluster theorem ) .",
    "the fact that the correlations are independent of the order of creation and annihilation operators ( except for the sign ) and that the @xmath49-point functions do depend on this order does not pose any problems for the following reason : except for the sign , the order of creation and annihilation operators is of importance only in contractions connecting two external vertices . and",
    "these contractions do not appear in connected diagrams .",
    "the linked cluster theorem can be proved in the following way . to each graph for a @xmath49-point function belongs a partition of the external vertices into connected components , e.g.  the graph shown in fig .",

    "this marked component determines one term in the temporal evolution of the @xmath49-point function . in order to reduce the formalism this",
    "is explained for the example : @xmath110 \\langle \\psi_{k_1 } \\cdots \\psi_{k_4 } \\psi_{k'_4}^{\\dag }      \\cdots \\psi_{k'_1}^{\\dag } \\rangle_t }    \\\\",

    "we will prove the linked cluster theorem by induction on the order of the correlations , corresponding to their recursive definition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cluster ] ) .",
    "obviously only connected diagrams contribute to the time evolution of the contractions as at least one external vertex must be contracted with the interaction vertex ( and the other one must be connected to the interaction vertex because of the fermionic particle conservation ) .",
    "we consider now a correlation @xmath111 of order @xmath112 and assume by induction that the linked cluster theorem holds for all correlations of order less than @xmath23 .",
    "the set of all diagrams for the corresponding @xmath49-point function @xmath113 is decomposed into classes of diagrams with the same partition of the external vertices and the same marked component .",
    "to each of the classes belongs a term in the cluster expansion of the differential equation , as described above . by induction , this term is described by the corresponding class of diagrams if the marked component is of order less than @xmath23 .",
    "but the total of these diagrams are all unconnected diagrams .",
    "thus , the remaining term in the cluster expansion of the differential equation @xmath114 \\langle \\psi_{k_1 } \\cdots \\psi_{k_n } \\psi_{k'_n}^{\\dag }    \\cdots \\psi_{k'_1}^{\\dag } \\rangle_t^c\\ ] ] is represented by the connected diagrams .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "of course , it is necessary to check the sign and the prefactor as well .",
    "as far as the factor @xmath115 is concerned , this is clear because the factor belongs to the component containing the interaction vertex",
    ". we will not give a formalized proof for the correctness of the sign , which should nonetheless be apparent as the sign only reflects the necessary permutation to bring the fermionic operators into the given order .",
    "we close with the remark that the proof is the same for the case of a non - diagonal one - particle hamiltonian @xmath19 and that for bosons the induction starts with the correlations of lowest order @xmath116 and no argument about particle - conservation is needed .",
    "the fact that only connected diagrams contribute to the time evolution of correlations is explained by the definition of the correlations because we allowed for all possible partitions of the creation and annihilation operators .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to define the cluster expansion for bosonic systems with non - vanishing expectation values @xmath117 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cluster ] ) and not as sometimes defined : @xmath118 otherwise , also unconnected diagrams give contributions to correlations .",
    "we now return to the example given in section [ sec : eom ] and present the diagrams for the correlations of one , two , and three particles .",
    "the diagrams for the one - particle distribution function representing the hartree - fock contribution and the `` real '' collision term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : one - particle ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1part_ex ] . in order to greatly reduce the number of diagrams , we draw the diagrams for higher - order correlations unlabeled and without arrows .",
    "these diagrams are to be seen as representatives for all the diagrams which arise by labeling the external vertices in all possible ways and attaching arrows consistently with the conservation of the particle number .",
    "the last two graphs in fig .",
    "[ fig:1part_ex ] , for example , are represented by the single graph in fig .",
    "[ fig:1part_noarrow ] . with this simplification",
    "there are four types of diagrams for the two - particle correlations ( cf .",
    "( [ eq:2part - correom ] ) ) shown in fig .  [ fig:2part_ex ] .",
    "the numbers of resulting diagrams with external labels and arrows are indicated in parentheses .",

    "[ fig:3part_ex ] without writing down the corresponding equations . to cut off the hierarchy at this order the four - particle correlations are ignored as described in section [ sec : eom ] .",
    "we have described the general formalism for a new method of deriving transport equations for quantum many - body systems .",
    "it is based on the equation - of - motion technique and a cluster expansion of many - particle expectation values .",
    "combining these two elements one obtains an exact infinite hierarchy of eom in terms of correlations which allows a consistent , unambiguous breaking at any order in contrast to the usual hierarchy .",
