    "@xcite enable to express vacuum characteristics of hadrons in terms of the vacuum expectation values of qcd operators .",
    "this approach was employed to description of nucleons in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the improved analysis was presented later in @xcite .",
    "the method was used also for description of delta - isobars @xcite and of the baryons containing heavier quarks @xcite .",
    "further applications of the vacuum nucleon qcd sum rules are reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the method was expanded also for the cases of finite temperatures  @xcite and densities  @xcite .",
    "the main tool of the vacuum qcd sum rules for a hadron is the dispersion relation for polarization operator @xmath0 with @xmath1 a local operator ( `` current '' ) carrying the quantum numbers of the hadron .",
    "it is nucleon ( proton ) in our case .",
    "the dispersion relation is considered at large values of @xmath2 where @xmath3 can be represented as a power series in @xmath4 , with the vacuum expectation values of qcd operators as the coefficients of the expansion .",
    "this is known as operator power expansion ( ope ) @xcite .",
    "recall the main milestones of the qcd sum rules analysis .",
    "following @xcite one can write dispersion relations @xmath5 @xmath6 for the ingredients @xmath7 of the polarization operator @xmath8 we equal the ope of the left - hand side ( lhs ) of eq .",
    "( 2 ) to the contribution of the observable hadrons to its right - hand side ( rhs ) .",
    "the latter is usually approximated by the  pole + continuum `` model in which the lowest pole is written exactly while the other states are approximated by continuum : @xmath9 of course , the ' ' pole + continuum \" model is reasonable only if the contribution of the pole exceeds that of the continuum .",
    "behavior of both sides of eq .",
    "( 2 ) prompts the choice @xcite @xmath10 note that in this approach the continuum threshold @xmath11 does not coincide with the physical continuum threshold .",
    "thus the position of the lowest pole @xmath12 , its residue @xmath13 and the model continuum threshold @xmath11 are the unknowns which are expected to be determined by the qcd sum rules equations .",
    "the standard next step is the borel transform , after which eqs.(2 ) take the form @xmath14 here @xmath15 are the borel transforms of the lhs ( rhs ) of eq .",
    "( 2 ) , @xmath16 is the borel mass .",
    "this approach provided good results for the nucleon mass and for the other nucleon parameters @xcite .",
    "note that both @xmath17 and @xmath18 are calculated in framework of certain models .",
    "the ope expansion for @xmath17 is increasingly true at large values of @xmath16 .",
    "the  pole + continuum \" for model for @xmath18is increasingly true at small values of @xmath16 .",
    "important assumption is that there is a region of intermediate values of @xmath16 where both approximations work and reproduce to some extend the true ( unknown ) function of @xmath16 .",
    "thus our task is to find the interval of the values of @xmath16 , where the functions @xmath17 can be approximated by the functions @xmath18 and to find the set of parameters @xmath19 and @xmath11 which insure the most accurate approximation of @xmath17 by @xmath18 .",
    "the set of values of parameters @xmath20 and @xmath11 , which minimize the function @xmath21 will be referred to as a solution of the sum rules equations .",
    "note that it is important to obtain  duality \" between the lhs and rhs of eq.(5 ) in some interval of the values of @xmath16 , but not at certain point @xmath22 .",
    "therefore we will look for the three unknown parameters simultaneously .",
    "both the interval of the values of the borel mass ( `` borel window '' ) and the solution of the sum rules depend on the form of the proton nucleon current @xmath1 , which is not determined in an unique way .",
    "the general form is @xcite @xmath23 with @xmath24\\gamma_5u_c(x ) ; \\quad j_2(x)= \\varepsilon_{abc}[u_a^t(x)c\\gamma_5d_b(x)]u_c(x),\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the quark operators , @xmath27 are the color indices , @xmath28 denotes a transpose and @xmath29 is the charge conjugation matrix , while @xmath30 is an arbitrary parameter .    following @xcite",
    ", we shall use the current determined by eq.(7 ) with @xmath31 .",
    "it can be written ( up to a factor @xmath32 ) as @xcite @xmath33\\gamma_5\\gamma^{\\mu}d_c(x)\\ ] ] this choice was shown in @xcite to be most relevant for description of nucleons , since the polarization operator @xmath3 calculated with this current satisfies two main requirements . on the rhs of eq.(5 )",
    "the contribution of the nucleon pole exceeds that of the higher states ( approximated by continuum ) . on the lhs of eq.(5 )",
    "the higher order terms of @xmath34 series should drop fast enough to be consistent with the convergence of the ope .",
    "it is important also that there is a gap between the position of the lowest pole @xmath35 and the effective threshold @xmath11 .",
    "this choice of the current was advocated in @xcite .",
    "there are many papers , in which this very current was used - see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "several lowest terms of the ope for the current ( 8) have been calculated in @xcite .",
    "the leading term depends on @xmath36 as @xmath37 .",
    "it comes from the free three - quark loop .",
    "the higher order ope terms contain the matrix elements @xmath38 etc .",
    "analysis carried out in @xcite contained also the most important radiative corrections in which the qcd coupling constant @xmath39 is multiplied by  large logarithm \" @xmath40 .",
    "corrections of the order @xmath41 to the leading ope terms have been calculated earlier in @xcite .",
    "the appropriate interval @xmath42 ( `` borel window '' ) was found in @xcite .",
    "the values of the lowest ope terms at conventional values of the qcd condensates enable to expect the convergence of ope series .",
    "also , for the solution found in @xcite the contribution of the pole exceeds that of the continuum .",
    "the ope series for @xmath43 and @xmath44 start from the terms @xmath37 and @xmath45 correspondingly .",
    "thus , in somewhat straightforward interpretation of ope only @xmath43 contains a leading term .",
    "this allows to consider the chirality conserving structure @xmath43 as a more important one .",
    "however actually we consider the values of the borel mass @xmath16 of the order of the proton mass .",
    "after the borel transform the leading contributions to @xmath43 and @xmath46 are of the same order .",
    "the chirality violating sum rule for @xmath44 can be considered as important as that for @xmath43 .",
    "the two sum rules were considered on the same terms , requiring the same accuracy for both of them .",
    "that s why the terms corresponding to @xmath43 and @xmath44 on the right hand side of eq.(6 ) were included with the same weights .",
    "a weak point of this procedure is that the choice of parameters @xmath47 and @xmath11 may be not simple .",
    "there can be several local minima of @xmath48 corresponding to several sets of the parameters .",
    "note that the values of qcd condensates are known with large uncertainties .",
    "the expectation value @xmath49 can be determined with the larger accuracy than the other condensates due to the gell - mann  oakes  renner relation  @xcite .",
    "there is no experimental data on values of four- and six - quark condensates .",
    "they can be calculated in the factorization approximation for the case of large number of colors @xmath50 .",
    "the accuracy of this approximation for @xmath51 is obscure .",
    "the value of gluon condensate was initially obtained from the qcd sum rules for @xmath52 mesons @xcite .",
    "however the sum rules for other mesons lead to somewhat smaller @xcite or larger @xcite values , with the latest analysis presented in @xcite .",
    "hence it is reasonable to study dependence of the nucleon parameters on the values of the qcd condensates .",
    "this dependence should be investigated together with inclusion of radiative corrections .",
    "the latter imitate modification of the values of the condensates providing the contributions @xmath53 and @xmath54 to each of ope term .",
    "thus , including the radiative corrections into our analysis , we can separate the effects of uncertainties in the qcd condensates values .    in the present paper",
    "we analyze the role of the unphysical solution for the nucleon qcd sum rules , which corresponds to the continuum contribution exceeding that of the pole .",
    "we mentioned this solution in our earlier papers @xcite . here",
    "we show that both physical and unphysical solutions provide local minima of the function @xmath55 determined by eq .  ( 6 ) .",
    "for the absolute values of condensates , which differ noticeably from the conventional values ( still consistent with convergence of the ope series on the lhs of the sum rules ) , the minima corresponding to physical solutions may vanish .",
    "we show that inclusion of the radiative corrections modifies the situation .",
    "one could expect this , since it was shown in @xcite that the radiative corrections affect mostly the value of the nucleon residue @xmath56 .",
    "after the corrections of the order @xmath39 are included perturbatively , the physical solution exists for a broader interval of the values of condensates .",
    "also , domination of continuum contribution over that of the pole for the unphysical solution becomes stronger .",
    "the unphysical solution becomes `` more unphysical '' .",
    "note that the problem of the pole dominance emerged in other qcd sum rules studies . in review on the qcd sum rules analysis of the pentaquark states",
    "@xcite the authors found that it is very difficult to satisfy the requirements of pole domination , ope series convergence and stability within the borel window simultaneously .",
    "this contrasts the earlier statements ( cited in @xcite ) that the qcd sum rules support the existence of the pentaquark .",
    "however , the authors of @xcite do not make a definite statement on the qcd sum rules predictions about the pentaquark states . in the qcd sum rules analysis of the light tetraquark states @xcite it was found that the solution with the domination of the pole can be obtained only for small values of the borel mass @xmath16 , where the ope series does not converge .",
    "the authors of @xcite conclude the qcd sum rules analysis does not support existence of light tetraquark particles .",
    "in view of the analysis carried out in the present paper , inclusion of the radiative corrections may become important here .    in section 2",
    "we analyze the interplay of the physical and unphysical solutions taking into account only the leading radiative corrections .",
    "we include corrections of the order @xmath39 in sec .  3 .",
    "we summarize in sec .  4 .",
    "we start by representing the nucleon qcd sum rules @xcite without using the factorization hypothesis for the condensates of the high dimensions .",
    "the lhs of the borel transformed nucleon sum rules ( eq.(5 ) ) with inclusion of the anomalous dimensions ( i.e. of the corrections of the order ( @xmath57 ) can be written as @xmath58 here the lower indices show the dimensions of the condensates . if the current @xmath59 in eq.(1 ) is given by eq.(8 ) , the terms on the right hand sides of eq .",
    "( 10 ) are @xcite @xmath60 here @xmath61 accounts for the leading radiative corrections @xmath62 @xcite @xmath63 with the anomalous dimension @xmath64 ( @xmath65 if the leading radiative corrections are neglected ) . after the borel",
    "transform @xmath66    the condensates @xmath67 are @xmath68 and @xmath69 is indeed more complicated .",
    "for example , @xmath70 contains the condensates @xmath71 with @xmath72 being the basic @xmath73 matrices @xmath74 .",
    "the same is true for @xmath69 .",
    "hence the matrix elements @xmath75 and @xmath76 in expressions for @xmath70 and @xmath69 in eq .",
    "( 13 ) are somewhat  effective \" @xmath77 and @xmath78 condensates",
    ". denote @xmath79 here we introduced dimensionless parameters @xmath80 . in the factorization approximation @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "we shall investigate the dependence of nucleon parameters on qcd condensates modifying the values of @xmath80 .",
    "note also that @xmath84 with @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "following @xcite we write @xmath86 for traditional choice of the normalization point @xmath87  gev @xmath88 putting all @xmath89 in eq .",
    "( 14 ) we come to the standard nucleon sum rules @xcite with @xmath90 here @xmath91 i.e. the contributions of continuum are transferred to the lhs of eq .",
    "the rhs of eq .",
    "( 5 ) @xmath92 contain only the contribution of the nucleon pole with @xmath93 .    in the borel window @xmath94 with @xmath95 is just @xmath96 determined by eq.(17 ) before the threshold contribution is transferred to the lhs .",
    "( note that @xmath97 and @xmath98 are numerically small due to a small coefficient connected with contributions of the gluon condensate ) .",
    "this is consistent with the hypothesis about convergence of the ope series .",
    "we can expect that the convergence will not be spoiled by the disregarder terms .",
    "note that the term @xmath99 can be viewed as coming from expansion of the expectation value of the operator @xmath100 in powers of @xmath101 .",
    "the ratio @xmath102 is the characteristic scale for further expansion in powers of @xmath34 , caused by expansion in powers of @xmath101 .",
    "the mixed quark - gluon condensates of higher dimensions are expected to have small numerical factors , connected with the gluons , similar to @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "finally , there is the only qcd parameter @xmath105 , and there can be contributions containing the factor @xmath106 .    in framework of the factorization hypothesis the method developed in @xcite provides @xmath107 if the numerical values ( 16 ) are employed .",
    "we assume @xmath108mev . in the one - loop approximation",
    "this corresponds to @xmath109  gev@xmath110 , which is consistent with the pdg data @xcite .",
    "if the radiative corrections are neglected , i.e. @xmath65 the solution appears to be @xmath111 one can see that for the solution represented by eq .",
    "( 21 ) the contribution of the pole exceeds that of continuum more than twice .",
    "however the successive inclusion of the ope terms leads to another solution . taking into account only the condensates with the dimensions @xmath112",
    "we find a trivial solution @xmath113 .",
    "inclusion of the condensate with @xmath114 keeps @xmath115 , @xmath116 but provides @xmath117 .",
    "the condensates with @xmath118 and @xmath119 require the nonzero values of @xmath12 and @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath120 we treat this solution as an unphysical one since in the borel window determined by eq.(9 ) the contribution of the pole is smaller than that of the continuum .",
    "for example , at the characteristic value @xmath121gev@xmath122 of the borel window the ratio of the continuum and pole contributions is 2 and 1.75 for the @xmath43 and @xmath44 structures correspondingly .",
    "as we shall see below , the unphysical solution manifests itself when the qcd condensates deviate from their conventional values .",
    "note that for all the cases discussed below eq.(19 ) is still true , and thus the convergence of the ope series is not violated .",
    "also ( see , e.g. fig.1 below ) the value of @xmath48 is small enough . hence , the only reason for assuming this solution to be unphysical is the domination of the contribution of the continuum over that of the pole .    it is instructive to trace the dependence of nucleon parameters on the value of gluon condensate . at @xmath123 ,",
    "i.e. at the value of the gluon condensate corresponding to eq .",
    "( 16 ) the functional ( 6 ) has two local minima corresponding to the solutions ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) .",
    "the deeper minimum is provided by the unphysical solution ( 22 ) . at @xmath124",
    "we still have two minima , and the values of the nucleon parameters do not change much even for @xmath125 due to a relatively small value of the term @xmath97 in eq .",
    "however for @xmath126 the deeper minimum corresponds to the unphysical solution ( 22 ) .",
    "somewhat straightforward employing of the chi - squired method may leave the physical solution unnoticed .",
    "the situation is more dramatic for @xmath127 . at @xmath128 the certain minimum corresponding to the physical solution",
    "vanishes and only the unphysical solution survives .    in order to illustrate the role of the unphysical solution in the borel window we introduce the function @xmath129 with @xmath130 and @xmath131 defined by eq.(10 ) . using eq.(18 )",
    "we see that for the values of @xmath16 determined by eq.(9 ) we can expect @xmath132 for the solutions of the sum rules equations .",
    "putting @xmath133 ( to make the difference of the corresponding @xmath48 values more visible ) we expect the solutions to be close to those described by eqs.(21),(22 ) for @xmath123 .",
    "the functions @xmath134 for @xmath135  gev@xmath122- see eq.(21 ) and for @xmath136gev@xmath122 -see eq.(22 ) are shown in fig.3 .",
    "one can see that the unphysical solution exhibits a more stable behavior then a physical one .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the dependence of @xmath47 and @xmath11 on the value of @xmath137 .",
    "note that if there is an unphysical solution which corresponds to the absolute minimum of the functional @xmath138 defined by eq.(6 ) , the search for another solution and its interpretation becomes more complicated .",
    "it is rather simple if both minima are sharp .",
    "however , if the unphysical solution corresponds to a wide minimum , while the second solution corresponds to a shallow one , interpretation of the latter solution requires additional analysis .",
    "now we come to variation of the values of the quark condensates .",
    "let us first modify the value of the condensate @xmath49 , keeping the other ones to be unchanged .",
    "hence we put @xmath139 in eq .",
    "( 14 ) , changing the value of @xmath140 .",

    "the physical solution disappears if @xmath142 exceeds slightly the value @xmath144 corresponding to the factorization hypothesis .",
    "there is no minimum corresponding to a physical solution for @xmath145  fig .",
    "5 . on the contrary ,",
    "the physical solution is not consistent with small values of @xmath143 .",

    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "there is no minimum corresponding to a physical solution since it vanishes for @xmath150 .",
    "here we include the corrections of the order @xmath39 and @xmath54 in the lowest order of perturbation theory .",
    "this modifies the contributions to @xmath151 . for the contributions of the free quark loop @xmath152 and for those of the scalar quark condensate @xmath153 and the four - quark condensate @xmath154 we have now @xcite @xmath155 with @xmath156 .",
    "corrections to the other ope terms are not included because of the large uncertainties of the values of the condensate .    the numerically large coefficient of the correction of the order @xmath39 to the term @xmath152 caused doubts in convergence of ope series @xcite . in @xcite eqs .",
    "( 23 ) and ( 24 ) were used for determination of nucleon parameters in framework of the finite energy sum rules .",

    "similar result was obtained in @xcite in framework of the borel transformed sum rules .",

    "we assume @xmath162gev@xmath163 , which is consistent with the recent data presented in fig.9.2 of @xcite .",
    "a somewhat larger value is given in @xcite .",
    "anyway , the nucleon parameteres depend weakly on the actual value of @xmath39-see fig.2 of @xcite .",
    "hence the same referes to the present analysis .",
    "the physical solution is now @xmath164 the unphysical solution is @xmath165 with the contribution of the pole 3 times smaller than that of the continuum .",
    "hence the radiative corrections made the unphysical solution even more `` unphysical '' .",
    "dependence of the nucleon mass on the values of condensates is shown in figs .  2a , 47 .",
    "one can see that the physical solution exists in the larger interval of the values of @xmath80 than in the case when only anomalous dimensions are included .",
    "the physical solution ( described by eq.(26 ) for @xmath166 ) provides absolute minimum of the function @xmath48 for @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169  see figs .  2 , 57 .",
    "dependence on the value @xmath140 without and with factorization assumptions is shown in figs . 4 and 7 correspondingly .",
    "note also that the variation of the limits of the borel window changes the values of nucleon parameters only by several percent .",
    "for example , solving eq.(5 ) in the intervals @xmath170gev@xmath171gev  @xmath122 we find @xmath172gev , while in the interval @xmath173gev@xmath174gev",
    "@xmath122 we obtain @xmath175 gev for @xmath176 .",
    "there is also an unphysical solution , but the corresponding values of @xmath48 are at least ten times larger then for the physical one .",
    "we analyzed dependence of the nucleon mass on the values of qcd condensates in framework of the qcd sum rules .",
    "we investigated also the dependence of the residue of the nucleon pole and of the continuum threshold in ",
    "pole + continuum \" model of the hadron spectrum .",
    "these dependences were studied with inclusion of radiative corrections of the order @xmath39 and @xmath54 .",
    "we presented three sets of the results for minimization of @xmath48 defined by eq.(6 ) in the borel window defined by eq.(9 ) .",
    "they correspond to total neglection of the radiative corrections , to inclusion of the corrections @xmath41 in all orders and to perturbative inclusion of corrections @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "it is shown that even at relatively small deviations of qcd condensates from the standard values the qcd sum rules have an unphysical solution with the contribution of continuum exceeding several times that of the nucleon pole .",
    "this contradicts the idea of the  pole + continuum \" model for the hadron spectrum .",
    "we showed that ( neglecting the radiative corrections ) at @xmath124 there is an interplay of the physical and unphysical solutions . in this case",
    "the two solutions can be separated .",
    "if both unphysical and physical solutions are connected with sharp minima of the dependence of the function @xmath48 on nucleon parameters , they can be separated easily . however in the general case , for example , for a wide minimum corresponding to the unphysical solution or for a shallow minimum of another solution the interpretation of the latter one may be obscure .",
    "the strongest limits on the values of condensates corresponding to a physical solution emerge if one includes the radiative corrections @xmath41 , the limits are weaker if the radiative corrections are totally neglected and still weaker if the corrections are included perturbatively  figs .",
    "thus for consistent calculations it is reasonable either to include the radiative corrections perturbatively or just to ignore them .",
    "we demonstrated that for the physical solution the value of the nucleon mass is less sensitive to the exact values of the condensates than those of the residue @xmath157 and of the continuum threshold @xmath11 .",
    "in other words , the uncertainties in the value of condensates influence mostly the magnitudes of @xmath157 and @xmath11 .",
    "we found that the nucleon mass depends mostly on the expectation value of the scalar quark operator @xmath177 .",
    "dependence on the condensates of higher dimensions is much weaker .",
    "the dependence on the condensate @xmath49 becomes weaker if one assumes factorization hypothesis for the four - quark and six - quark condensates .    in the qcd sum",
    "rules the nucleon mass obtained a nonzero value due to exchange by noninteracting quark ",
    "antiquark pairs between the nucleon current and vacuum .",
    "as we have seen perturbative inclusion of interactions taking place at the distances of the order @xmath178 , corresponding to inclusion of the radiative corrections @xmath53 make the solution more stable .",
    "the physical solution exists in a broad interval of the values of @xmath49 if the radiative corrections are included perturbatively . on the other hand",
    "the unphysical solution becomes `` more unphysical '' , with a stronger dominance of the contribution of continuum over that of the pole .",
