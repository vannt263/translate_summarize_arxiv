    "gravitational collapse results in black holes which contain singularities .",
    "the collapse process is not described by an analytical solution of the field equations , and the gravitational field is so strong that perturbation theory is not helpful either . so numerical simulation is needed .",
    "but even here , the full process of gravitational collapse is not usually examined : some simulations examine the formation of black holes but not singularities @xcite while others examine singularities but not black holes @xcite .",
    "note , however , that there has been some recent progress in numerical simulations capable of examining the formation of both black holes and singularities.@xcite in the case where black holes are examined , the simulation sometimes ends when the black hole forms @xcite or the simulation goes on , but the interior of the black hole is excised @xcite . in the case where the singularity is examined ,",
    "one usually imposes periodic boundary conditions , which means that what is studied is singularity formation in a closed cosmology .",
    "there is a longstanding conjecture due to belinskii , khalatnikov , and lifschitz ( bkl ) as to the general behavior of spacetime singularities.@xcite essentially the bkl conjecture is that as a generic singularity is approached in a comoving coordinate system , the field equations will be dominated by terms containing derivatives with respect to time , and all other terms can be neglected .",
    "the bkl conjecture has been verified by numerical simulations@xcite for the case of singularity formation in a closed cosmology .",
    "since bkl dynamics are local , it seems likely that the bkl conjecture is also true in the case of singularity formation inside a black hole ( at least for part of the singularity , see @xcite for a conjecture about another part of the singularity ) .",
    "however , one would like to verify the bkl conjecture by a treatment of the singularities inside black holes .",
    "one of the earliest studies of gravitational collapse , that of oppenheimer and snyder @xcite was capable of also examining the singularity . in @xcite gravitational collapse",
    "is modeled as a spherically symmetric spacetime containing two parts : the schwarzschild metric on the outside and a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) spacetime with non - relativistic matter ( dust ) on the inside .",
    "the schwarzschild and frw spacetimes have two different coordinate systems which must be matched along the boundary .",
    "this difficulty can be overcome @xcite through a coordinate transformation which allows the full spacetime to be covered by a single coordinate system .",
    "however a more serious difficulty is that pressureless dust is not a good model of how matter behaves in the extreme conditions of singularity formation .",
    "so the properties of dust singularities tell us very little about the properties of generic singularities .",
    "ideally , one would like to check the bkl conjecture by treating the gravitational collapse of a more realistic matter model , like a scalar field , using a single coordinate system that follows the formation of the black hole and the singularity .",
    "as a preliminary step in that direction , we perform numerical simulations of the behavior of a test massive scalar field on the spacetime of @xcite using the coordinates of @xcite .",
    "the relevant equations and numerical methods are described in section 2 , while results are presented and discussed in section 3 .",
    "a spherically symmetric spacetime can be put in the form @xcite @xmath0 here , @xmath1 is the usual area coordinate , while @xmath2 is a time coordinate chosen so that @xmath3 .",
    "we now show how to put the schwarzschild and frw metrics in this form .",
    "the schwarzschild metric in the usual coordinates is @xmath4 we wish to express @xmath5 as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath1 so that the metric takes the form of eqn .",

    "( [ pgmetric ] ) . comparing the angular parts of the metric",
    ", it is clear that we must have @xmath12 .",
    "it is then straightforward to show that with @xmath13 the metric of eqn .",

    "( [ pgmetric ] ) with @xmath14    the collapse takes place at negative times and is complete at @xmath15 .",
    "the boundary between the interior frw part of the spacetime and the exterior schwarzschild part is given by @xmath16 .",
    "for some function @xmath17 . since the metric , and",
    "therefore @xmath18 must be continuous across the boundary , we have @xmath19 thus the spacetime metric is given by eqn .",

    ". the initial scalar field can be thought of as a linear combination of a left mover and a right mover .",
    "the right mover escapes from the black hole , while the left mover plunges towards it . some part of the left mover scatters off of the black hole , while another part is captured and approaches the singularity .",
    "we are particularly interested in finding the behavior of the scalar field as the singularity is approached . in our coordinate system ,",
    "the singularity is approached as @xmath63 but only in the frw portion of the spacetime . to examine the scalar field behavior near the singularity",

    "it is clear that the trend is that as the singularity is approached , the scalar field gets a larger amplitude and a steeper profile . to see whether this behavior can be understood quantitatively",
    ", we turn to the bkl conjecture : the claim that as a generic singularity is approached in a comoving coordinate system , the field equations will be dominated by terms containing derivatives with respect to time , and all other terms can be neglected . to apply this conjecture , we consider the klein - gordon equation ( [ kleingordon ] ) in the untransformed frw metric and coordinates given by eqns .",
