    "production of superpartners at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , the event rates observed in the recent cosmic ray data @xcite , and potentially in dark matter direct detection experiments @xcite , all may be linked to the composition of dark matter .",
    "a well motivated class of candidate models that can be tested on all of these fronts arises when the dark matter is the lightest r - parity odd supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) and has a substantial wino component .",
    "however , even if the lsp is produced at the lhc at a relatively light mass , a discoverable signal at the lhc may be difficult unless colored superpartners such as the gluino , are light .",
    "there are few top down models which generically imply an lsp that is dominantly wino with a light gluino .",
    "the breaking of supersymmetry ( susy ) through a pure anomaly mediated contribution does predict an lsp that is a wino , but needs an extension to provide a consistent model .",
    "string frameworks of interest which give rise to a light gluino and predict a wino lsp include those based on the fluxless sector of @xmath7 compactifications from which a realistic model of soft susy breaking has been constructed @xcite .",
    "related models of soft breaking based on the heterotic string can also yield a light gluino with a wino - like lsp @xcite , and a light gluino / wino - like lsp system can also arise from gaugino mass non - universality in d - brane models of soft susy breaking @xcite .    that a wino - like lsp is consistent with the pamela satellite data with a mass of order 200 gev has been emphasized @xcite , and recent works have begun to study the implications of a light wino with a correspondingly light gluino @xcite . generally , for a pure wino , or wino - like dark matter candidate",
    ", the predictions on the relic abundance can be in the vicinity of the wmap data @xcite .",
    "relatively light wino - like dark matter can produce the correct relic density and have a thermal history provided it contains non - negligible bino and higgsino components in extended theories @xcite , while the pure wino can do so in a non - thermal paradigm due to the decay of heavy moduli @xcite ( for recent related work see @xcite ) .",
    "the heavy moduli can add large additional post freeze - out entropy to the primordial particle density from the moduli decay into the susy sector .",
    "this decay also leads to a release of winos which annihilate at a temperature much lower than freeze - out .    for the class of models we are interested in here ,",
    "the gluino mass is rather light , as dictated by the soft breaking of supersymmetry and electroweak symmetry breaking , leading to large gluino production cross sections with subsequent decays of the gluinos via three - body decay chains .",
    "thus a prominent lhc signal arises from multijet production .",
    "some early susy discovery prospects in multijets at the lhc over a broad class of models have been given in @xcite@xcite ( for reviews see @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "distinctively , here we emphasize well motivated models that yield dark matter annihilation cross sections consistent with the recent pamela data , and also lead to a spectrum with a light gluino .",
    "the associated production of gluinos and a wino - like lsp lead to a simultaneous probe of supersymmetry at colliders and in present dark matter experiments , where the gluino is linked to the chargino and neutralino through its dominant three body decay channels .",
    "the analysis of electroweak gauginos at colliders with mass degeneracy between the lsp and chargino has been studied in great detail ( for early work see @xcite and for a recent analysis see @xcite ) where the soft decays of the chargino can lead to a wino lsp and a charged pion , giving rise to a displaced vertex of a track length of a few centimeters .",
    "the organization of this paper is a follows : in section [ g2 ] we briefly review a soft breaking sector of interest which gives rise to a light wino and a light gluino and serves to illustrate the effects of the expected high jet multiplicity from the production of gluinos at the lhc .",
    "we then discuss the numerical simulations that allow us to make contact between the theory and the data and enable a connection between the predictions for the lhc and to possible signals of dark matter . following this , in section [ lhcmodels ]",
    "we analyze the early discovery prospects of such models at the lhc for benchmark models and also for a large collection of models .",
    "the above is all carried out in the framework of the @xmath7 models with a pure wino lsp and a light gluino .    in section [ generalpredictions ]",
    "we examine a larger class of models in the context of relic density and direct and indirect detection of dark matter .",
    "we include models which deviate from a pure wino , but still have a substantial wino component . here , as before , the soft breaking of supersymmetry and radiative electroweak symmetry breaking dictate the mass of relatively light gluino in the models of interest .",
    "we optimistically conclude in section [ conc ] .",
    "the underlying framework we work in is described by @xmath8 supergravity .",
    "we first consider the @xmath9 @xcite which has a generalized sector of soft susy breaking derived from both @xcite a tree level supergravity contribution and an anomalous contribution .. ] the soft parameters can be parametrized at the unification scale as @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the gravitino mass , @xmath14 is a universal scalar mass , @xmath15 are the gaugino masses , and @xmath16 are the tri - linear couplings of the third generation . here",
    "the parameters @xmath17 are functions of the microscopic theory which are determined entirely from the effective supergravity model .",
    "the soft parameters are well approximated by ( for the complete analytical expressions see @xcite ) @xmath18 , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , and @xmath21 parametrizes gauge coupling corrections in the tree level sector of the gaugino masses .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 arises as a consequence of the hidden sector potential which is responsible for tuning the cosmological constant to zero .",
    "the terms entering for the tri - linears of the third generation are well approximated by @xmath23 up to small corrections in the normalized yukawas and the normalized volume @xmath24 of the @xmath7 manifold , the latter of which enters in the determination of the gravitino mass .",
    "the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation values is generically in the range @xmath25 as @xmath26 and @xmath27 are both taken to arise from the quadratic term in the kahler potential , and are similar in magnitude . here",
    "the largeness of the gravitino mass decouples the scalars while the gaugino masses are suppressed relative to the gravitino mass , where the suppression enters via the volume of hidden sector three cycles .",
    "the physical values of the soft parameters are sensitive to the precise value of the unified gauge coupling and threshold corrections .",
    "the largeness of the gravitino mass generically drives the @xmath26 term to be order @xmath28 for electroweak symmetry breaking , which in turn induces a relatively large self energy correction @xcite to the electroweak gaugino masses @xcite .",
    "the models studied in reference @xcite did not have a solution of the @xmath26 problem , but simply assumed that @xmath26 and the associated soft breaking term @xmath29 arose from the quadratic term in the kahler potential .",
    "when the issues of embedding the standard model in the @xmath7 manifold are fully understood it could happen that @xmath26 is small by symmetry arguments , e.g. u(1 ) charges force the bilinear term to vanish . then if @xmath26 was of the same order as @xmath30 there would be some higgsino mixture in the @xmath7 wino , so the theories would have a wino - like lsp instead of a pure wino one . in this paper",
    "we use  @xmath31 to refer to the pure wino case of reference @xcite . if the theory developed to imply a wino - like lsp the results for describing",
    "the pamela data and lhc predictions would change very little ; however predictions on dark matter direct detection would be considerably modified .      in this work",
    "we have implemented the complete analytical expressions for soft breaking terms of the @xmath7-mssm into softsusy@xcite .",
    "the analysis includes the gaugino mass threshold corrections @xcite with 2 loop scalar corrections , 2-loop rges for the higgs and gaugino masses , @xmath26 , and yukawa and gauge couplings @xcite .",
    "branching fractions have been computed with susyhit @xcite and production of signal and backgrounds are generated with pythia @xcite and pgs @xcite with the level 1 ( l1 ) triggers designed to efficiently reproduce cms specifications @xcite ( for detailed discussions see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "signal and background have been simulated at @xmath32 in order to generalize our predictions for preliminary lhc runs and future operational center of mass energies .",
    "specifically , sm backgrounds have been generated with qcd multi - jet production due to light quark flavors , heavy flavor jets ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) , drell - yan , single @xmath35 production in association with quarks and gluons ( @xmath36 + jets / @xmath37 + jets ) , and @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 pair production resulting in multi - leptonic backgrounds .",
    "laboriously , samples were generated at @xmath41 with up to 5  @xmath5 of luminosity . in pgs4 jets",
    "are defined through a cluster - based algorithm which has a heavy flavor tagging efficiency based on the parametrizations of the cdf run ii tight / loose ( secondary ) vertex b - tagging algorithm @xcite .",
    "the standard criteria for the discovery limit of new signals is that the susy signals should exceed either @xmath42 or 10 whichever is larger , i.e. , @xmath43 , were @xmath44 indicates the channel of interest .",
    "the signature space of the models we probe has distinctive dark matter predictions .",
    "the models we consider are dominated by dark matter annihilations into @xmath45 and can yield a significant flux of cosmic antimatter in the galactic halo ( for early work see @xcite ) .",
    "the annihilation cross section receives an enhancement relative to other susy modes since it is s - wave and has a relative strength dictated by the su(2 ) gauge coupling and the wino component of the lsp .",
    "the models are made consistent with the relic density constraints as will be discussed .",
    "for the analysis of dark matter annihilation cross sections and their resultant fluxes we employ fragmentation functions from darksusy @xcite using pythia . in this work we also model cosmic fluxes with galprop v50.1p @xcite",
    "in theories with wino lsps , the dominant lhc production modes are not strictly those from strongly produced susy .",
    "the production modes of the wino ( @xmath46 ) and the lightest chargino ( @xmath47 ) are competitive with the gluino ( @xmath48 ) production and frequently are larger . however due to the small splittings ( a fraction of a gev ) between the wino and chargino the decay products here are soft . except for larger gluino masses , we find that most events that pass the triggers do indeed come from @xmath49 production , though as much as 30% of the events come from electroweak production .",
    "thus the dominant production modes are @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "the decays modes lead to rich jet and missing energy signatures with a sizeable number of leptons in the final state .",
    "in particular the dominant decays are as follows : @xmath51 $ ] with secondary decays @xmath52 and @xmath53 with tertiary branchings of the produced standard model particles @xmath54 and @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "the models are rather predictive as they typically require no more than 2 - 3 branchings to complete susy cascades resulting in lepton and jet signatures .",
    "while this is a typical signature of susy in a generic model , it is actually a prediction of the wino branch of the @xmath7 model as electroweak symmetry breaking corners the viable parameter space and thus the viable signature space .",
    "the decays of @xmath56 and their jet and lepton by - products will be very soft yet there can be radiation of gluon from the initial or final state partons that can generate a relatively hard jet .",
    "thus one can look for a hard monojet and n - jet events with large missing energy as an early indication of the production of supersymmetric events at the lhc . in table ( [ parbench ] )",
    "we illustrate some typical spectra found in the @xmath7 models for @xmath57 ( precisely in the mass range pointed to by the recent pamela data [ see sec.([positrons ] ) ] along with the dominant branching ratio of the gluino given in table ( [ branch ] ) .",
    ".benchmark models predicting a light gluino and a lsp that is a wino with a degenerate chargino with a light second neutralino ( which is mostly bino ) .",
    "the last four columns carry units of gev . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ lhcdata ]    in figure  ( [ fig1 ] ) ( left upper panel ) one observes that the models can produce detectable multi - jet signals even at @xmath58 tev for @xmath59 of integrated luminosity under the standard @xmath60 discovery reach criteria in the kinematic variable @xmath61 . in figure  ( [ fig1 ] ) ( right upper panel )",
    "we show the large number of multijet signals .",
    "the analysis shows that the model can produce a large excess in hadronic jets over the backgrounds .",
    "the large jet multiplicity arises from the three body decay of the gluinos and from jets arising from initial state radiation .",
    "we find the discovery limit is optimal for 4 - 5 jets with a lepton veto and large missing energy cut .",
    "the lower right panel exhibits @xmath62 with larger luminosity .",
    "the lower left panel shows the discovery reach for the same model with @xmath63 and @xmath60 can be reached with several hundred inverse picobarns of data .",
    "having established that the highly constrained , and therefore predictive @xmath7 model can give rise to detectable signals of susy with early lhc data ( see also @xcite ) , we now extend the analysis to a larger region of the @xmath7 parameter space rather than focusing on a benchmark model .",
    "we have performed a detailed scan of the parameter space of these models over the parameters discussed in section [ g2 ] , consistent with radiative electroweak symmetry breaking subject to the constraint that the wino mass is in the range ( 170 - 210 ) gev .",
    "we uncover a large parameter space where the gluino can be relatively light in the @xmath7 model .",
    "the majority of the models have a gluino in the mass range of 500 to 900 gev ( see fig.([figrat ] ) for the corresponding gaugino mass ratios ) .",
    "lhc predictions with light gluino have been studied recently @xcite , but without considering the connection to the pamela data , which we pursue in the next section .    in table",
    "( [ lhcdata ] ) we display the relatively large total theoretical production cross section before cuts ( @xmath64 from gluino , neutralino , chargino production ) and the effective susy cross section @xmath65 ( cross section after the l1 triggers have been passed ) .",
    "one observes that the l1 triggers are well optimized for these events as a large fraction of the susy cross section is maintained .",
    "the substantial missing energy arises in many of the models from the prompt branching of the gluino into 2 jets and the lsp wino .",
    "event rates at the lhc are shown in the 4-jet channel and the 2b channel with just 1 fb@xmath66 of integrated luminosity at @xmath58 tev along with the ratio of the signal to the square root of the background .",
    "these models can be discovered very early with the lhc and can begin to be probed at @xmath67     figure ( [ fig3 ] ) displays the effective susy production cross section after cuts ( @xmath65 ) as a function of gluino mass at various center of mass energies .",
    "the ( shaded ) colored regions are the necessary luminosity need for a @xmath68 excess in steps of 200 pb@xmath66 of integrated luminosity where we require at least 5 jets and large missing energy @xmath69 gev .",
    "thus it is apparent from the analysis that nearly all the models can produce discoverable signals with low luminosity .",
    "remarkably , we find that with only @xmath70 of data at @xmath71 10 tev , the models will produce large jet - based signals which can be discovered over the sm backgrounds over a part of the parameter space , even for gluinos as light as 550 gev with @xmath72 at @xmath73 tev .",
    "models with wino - like lsps , and thus nearly degenerate charginos and neutralinos , are well known to be be difficult to study @xcite .",
    "the chargino lifetime can be of order a centimeter , and the second heavier neutralino can even have order tens of gev splitting ( see table ( [ parbench ] ) for such theory motivated examples ) .",
    "once a set of gluino candidates have been identified , an off - line analysis focused towards the study of the chargino and neutralino states in the gluino decay products will be necessary .",
    "in this section we relax the tight constraints of the @xmath7 theory space and explore the possibility of an lsp which has a significant wino component (  wino - like \" ) , but may also have non - negligible bino and higgsino components .",
    "one natural class of models where such an lsp is achieved are in grand unified models such as @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 where the gut symmetry is broken by a non - singlet @xmath77 term leading to gaugino masses at the unification scale that are non - universal , i.e. , @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "such soft breaking mass terms can give rise to a wino - like lsp with a light gluino if the high scale values of the gaugino masses , @xmath30 and @xmath80 , are reduced relative to @xmath81 .      in a general setting , the relic density can be equal to the observed one with a wino - like or pure wino lsp due to the late decay of a modulus field .",
    "such is possible in a universe that has a non - thermal cosmological history @xcite .",
    "thus , for a single heavy modulus field @xmath82 , in the so - called instantaneous decay approximation one obtains a reheat temperature , @xmath83 , due to the decay @xmath84 by assuming all energy density of @xmath82 is transferred into radiation .",
    "the modulus decays after freeze - out and the reheat temperature is @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "here @xmath87 , @xmath88 , where @xmath89 , where @xmath90 parametrizes deviations from the planck scale ( moduli couplings at ( much lower ) intermediate scales have been considered in @xcite ) .",
    "for example , @xmath91 gives @xmath92 which may be interpreted as an effective string scale . under this assumption of non - thermal ( nt )",
    "production one has @xmath93 , where @xmath94 can be computed in the usual manner ( see i.e. @xcite ) .",
    "for the s - wave dominated lsp interaction , we obtain @xmath95 , where we have used @xmath96 , and where @xmath97 .",
    "a saturation of the error corridor from the wmap constraint on @xmath98 is then possible for a gravitino in the mass range @xmath99 tev . in the @xmath7 models specific calculations of the relic abundance from moduli decay",
    "have been carried out @xcite giving a relic density , from a string based construction , a few times larger than the experimental value unless the gravitino mass is order 100 tev .    in greater generality , the nature of soft breaking and the cosmological history of the universe",
    "may very well be closely tied together @xcite . on the other hand , in a non - thermal framework one can also approach the wmap constraint so long as @xmath83 does not spoil bbn constraints @xcite .    in a thermal paradigm the relic abundance of a wino - like lsp can also be brought in accord with the wmap data in the presence of residual abelian gauge factors that survive down to the susy scale and mix weakly with the mssm neutralinos leading to a co - annihilation enhancement @xcite in an otherwise depleted relic abundance from the large annihilations of the lsp .",
    "this is to be contrasted with enhancements in the halo cross section , i.e. through a sommerfeld enhancement @xcite or through a breit - wigner enhancement @xcite or a boost in the flux via dark matter clumps @xcite .",
    "thus predictions on the relic density consistent with the production of positrons in the halo are rather model dependant , but nevertheless can account for the proper relic abundance of dark matter in such models .",
    "the data released by the pamela collaboration indicates a large excess in positron flux in the halo . for the case of models with mssm field content ,",
    "annihilations of the lsp into @xmath37 bosons are dominant possible sources of positrons and indeed the @xmath100 production provides the needed cross section in the halo to account for the pamela anomaly for a pure wino @xcite@xcite without any boost factor in the positron flux ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "the pamela data can also be fit when the lsp has a non - negligible higgsino component @xcite with small boost ( clump ) factors in the positron flux @xmath102 .",
    "figure ( [ figpam ] ) illustrates fits to the data for various neutralino masses with no boost factor in the positron flux .",
    "the figure is meant to show that models with wino - like lsps which describe the pamela positron ratio should have masses in the range near ( 170 - 200 ) gev .",
    "progress has been made towards a complete fit to both the pamela positron , antiproton data , and the fermi @xmath103 flux data using galprop @xcite and more exhaustive analyses are currently under way .",
    "a lighter lsp could also produce the pamela signal with a different set of propagation parameters .",
    "if other effects , such as small density fluctuations are included , the lsp mass range could cover slightly heavier masses .",
    "the relative strength of the photon line spectrum arising from dark matter annihilations in the galaxy @xcite is highly sensitive to the gaugino content of the lsp @xcite@xcite .",
    "thus with an essentially pure wino , as in the g@xmath104 models , @xmath105 , for a wino mass corresponding to the line energy of fig.([figdata2 ] ) .",
    "such models provide promising probes for dark matter candidates with the fermi data @xcite in the central galaxy and from dwarf galaxies . in fig.([figdata2 ] ) we illustrate this effect for the recently released photon data @xcite .",
    "the analysis shows that annihilations of a pure wino are not inconsistent with an isothermal profile ( which may be favoured by recent simulations including baryons @xcite ) .",
    "such a constraint is highly dependent on the profile uncertainties . at present",
    ", the pamela data can be described consistently with the fermi photon data and fig.([figdata2 ] ) shows that fermi is close to sensitivity needed to see a signal in the line source .",
    "another probe of annihilating dark matter comes from the fermi analysis on dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "the recently reported results show the strongest constraints are from ursa minor and draco implying a signal should be seen for wino masses below @xmath106 .",
    "this constraint assumes a nfw dwarf density profile @xcite ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "there presently is a rather appreciable uncertainty in the predicted flux from the dwarf galaxies due in part to the integration over the density ( squared ) source of dark matter @xcite,@xcite . for the case of the draco dwarf galaxy ref .",
    "@xcite finds an uncertainty of a factor of 10 or more .",
    "a more detailed analysis will help shed light on these constraints .",
    "it would be premature to deduce that the constraints are ruling out models until the profile of the dwarf galaxies are better understood and the inclusion of more stars enters into the analyses .",
    "a related indication of wino - like dark matter ( but not pure wino ) is that of an enhanced spin independent ( si ) cross section when the wino content is supplemented by non - negligible sources of higgsino and bino content .",
    "the spin dependent cross section is also enhanced , and their contribution is not negligible , at least for xenon based targets . for the si interactions with admixtures of the above type one finds si cross sections in the interesting region of @xmath107 @xcite , ( for recent related work see @xcite ) .",
    "for a pure wino , the tree level cross section involving the higgs exchanges vanish and loop corrections @xcite are not large enough to bring the cross section up in the region that is presently testable",
    ". thus observation of a signal in cdms ii , xenon-100 ( or edelweiss and other related experiments ) would immediately exclude a pure wino lsp .",
    "deviating from the pure wino by a few percent leads to a detectable ( si ) cross section .",
    "for example , with soft breaking parameters @xmath108 , with @xmath109 , the lsp forms a _ wino - like eigenstate _ : @xmath110 , _ with both a large halo annihilation cross section , @xmath111 , and detectable si scattering cross sections , @xmath112 . _ specifically , one obtains the following : @xmath113 , and @xmath114 with @xmath115 . here",
    "the lsp mass is @xmath116 and the gluino mass is very light @xmath117 .",
    "such a model would produce discoverable jet signatures immediately at the lhc .",
    "thus , this class of model produces positrons in the halo which describe the pamela data , and produces a spin independent scattering cross section within reach of the cdms and xenon experiments ( see : @xcite and @xcite for a similar emphasis ) . on the other hand",
    "if xenon-100 sees no signal , and the pamela data turns over at higher energies , a pure wino remains a possible and well - motivated interpretation .",
    "in this letter we have studied collider and dark matter implications within the setting of soft supersymmerty breaking based on string compactifications and in related models with non minimal gaugino sectors .",
    "the implications of a pure wino and a wino - like lsp in association with the production of light gluinos at the lhc , along with a possible interpretation of dark matter annihilations as a cause for the rising positron ratio in pamela satellite data , all provide exciting possibilities for the early discovery of supersymmetry .",
    "such a discovery will have strong implications for the underlying theory and for the nature of soft supersymmetry breaking , as well as for the cosmological history of the universe .",
    "an underlying theory which can accommodate the positron excess , can produce testable event rates in direct detection experiments , and lead to testable signatures at the lhc due to the presence of light gluinos , all can arise with an lsp that has a substantial wino component .",
    "in addition , the wino - like lsp can have a spin independent interaction cross section that can be rather large when a non - negligible higgsino component is present .",
    "a theory of this kind provides a compelling candidate to explain the nature of dark matter , its relic density from re - heating , and its annihilations in the galaxy .",
    "recent photon constraints from fermi on the above class of models are also analyzed and we have shown that there is a large region of parameter space where a wino - like lsp is consistent with the constraints .",
    "the constraints are very sensitive to the gaugino content of the wavefunction of the lsp and to the assumed halo profile .",
    "this parameter space accommodates light gluinos and therefore jets and missing energy signals that can be tested with early data at the lhc .",
    "we have particularly emphasized , via specific models , a light gluino , and the importance of three - body decay chains which yield large jet multiplicities from the light gluino decays producing wino or wino - like lsps .",
    "the resulting set of decays are strikingly simple and predictive with gaugino production controlling the event topologies . the nearly degenerate charginos and neutralinos arise from the three body decays of the gluino and",
    "could be identified with a careful analysis after collecting a sample of gluino events . indeed",
    "the models discussed here are ripe for studies at the lhc with low luminosities and at start up center of mass energies due to their large multi - jet event rates .",

    "<S> motivated by specific connections to dark matter signatures , we study the prospects of observing the presence of a relatively light gluino whose mass is in the range @xmath0 with a wino - like lightest supersymmetric particle with mass in the range of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the light gaugino spectra studied here is generally different from other models , and in particular those with a wino dominated lsp , in that here the gluinos can be significantly lighter . </S>",
    "<S> the positron excess reported by the pamela satellite data is accounted for by annihilations of the wino lsp and their relic abundance can generally be brought near the wmap constraints due to the late decay of a modulus field re - populating the density of relic dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> we also mention the recent fermi photon constraints on annihilating dark matter in this class of models and implications for direct detection experiments including cdms and xenon . </S>",
    "<S> we study these signatures in models of supersymmetry with non - minimal soft breaking terms derived from both string compactifications and related supergravity models which generally lead to non - universal gaugino masses . at the lhc , </S>",
    "<S> large event rates from the three - body decays of the gluino in certain parts of the parameter space are found to give rise to early discovery prospects for the gaugino sector . </S>",
    "<S> excess events at the 5 sigma level can arise with luminosity as low as @xmath2(100 ) @xmath3 at a center of mass energy of 10 tev and @xmath4(1 ) @xmath5 at @xmath6 . </S>"
