    "the superfluid @xmath0he is a unique system among the other condensed matter , because it has the maximum symmetry breaking , which can be compared only with the vacuum in the elementary particle physics , and due to the rich set of the fermionic and bosonic excitations interacting with gauge - like fields of numerous collective modes @xcite .",
    "most of the common phenomena are yet to be confirmed in the particle physics while they are quite routinely observed or can be investigated in @xmath0he .",
    "these include the variety of topological defects with their potential astrophysical and cosmological consequences .",
    "till now in particle physics only the perturbative features of the modern quantum field theories have been put to the test and it would be worthwhile to have a better understanding of the non - perturbative aspects",
    ". such an understanding may be crucial , for example , for testing the hypothesis that the baryon number of the universe was produced ( baryogenesis ) during the electroweak or other phase transition in the early universe . to gain some intuition ,",
    "we need such condensed matter system as superfluid @xmath0he , which has the closest similarity with the physical vacuum .",
    "this makes the superfluid @xmath0he a working laboratory for modelling different processes which can occur in the physical vacuum and in universe .",
    "the complicated topology of the @xmath0he vacuum results in a variety of defects in @xmath0he , such as monopoles , hedgehogs , boojums , solitons , domain walls , textures , vortices , which have many direct analogies with topological defects in quantum vacuum .",

    "there are also combinations of topological defects of different dimensionality found in helsinki rotating cryostat : in @xmath0he - a it is the vortex sheet  the soliton plane filled with the vortex lines @xcite , which topology is similar to that of bloch lines within the bloch wall in ferromagnets . in @xmath0he",

    "the analog of the former instability is realized in the moving @xmath0he - b , if its velocity reaches the landau value : the creation of quasiparticles in supercritical regime , detected in vibrating wire experiments@xcite , is similar to the creation of the electron - positron pairs by strong field .      in many cases",

    "we discuss the `` momentogenesis ''  production of the fermionic linear momentum during the vortex motion .",
    "this leads to the additional nondissipative force on the vortex which competes with conventional magnus force .",

    "the equation for the balance of forces acting on the moving vortex contains 3 nondissipative forces and the friction one@xcite : @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the parameter of the friction force , which arises when the vortex moves with respect to the heat - bath .",
    "the nondissipative forces contain ( i ) the conventional magnus force on the vortex moving with respect to the superfluid vacuum @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the vortex winding number , @xmath13 is the circulation quantum , @xmath14 the density of the liquid .",
    "\\(ii ) iordanskii force is the result of the aharonov - bohm effect , experienced by excitations in bulk liquid , when they interact with the vortex@xcite : @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the ( tensor ) density of the normal component .",

    "\\(iii ) the so called spectral - flow force is responsible for the `` momentogenesis '' which we discuss below @xmath17 the parameter @xmath18 is determined by the anomalous dynamics of fermions in the core@xcite .",
    "there is a close connection between the spectral flow force and the nonconservation of the baryon number @xmath19 in the presence of the @xmath20 and @xmath3 field strengths @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the number of families .",

    "the counterpart of the axial anomaly in condensed matter leads to the net product of the fermionic linear momentum @xmath36 in the time - dependent texture : @xmath37 since the total linear momentum is conserved in condensed matter , the eq.(4.7 ) means that the momentum is transferred from the superfluid _ vacuum _ to the _ matter _ ( the normal component ) in the presence of the time - dependent texture .",
    "the continuous vortex moving in 3he - a generates both the `` electric '' and `` magnetic '' fields and thus represents the right texture , which leads to the momentogenesis .",
    "integration of the anomalous momentum transfer in eq.(4.7 ) over the cross - section of the soft core of the moving vortex gives the lost of the linear momentum@xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the force acting on the vortex in the form of eq.(4.4 ) : @xmath38 the parameter @xmath18 appears to be temperature independent , @xmath39 , and is close to the mass density @xmath14 .",
    "the continuous vortex provides an example of the extreme spectral - flow force , which effectively cancels the magnus force in eq.(4.2 ) .      for singular vortices in @xmath0he - b and superconductors the spectral flow",
    "is suppressed due to discrete character of the fermionic spectrum in the vortex core@xcite .",

    "the dynamics of the core fermions also determines the friction parameter @xmath10 @xcite : @xmath46      the forces on the vortex have been recently measured in superfluid @xmath0he - b in a broad temperature range @xcite .",
    "the results are expressed in terms of @xmath47 the experimental bell shape of @xmath48 follows the temperature dependence of @xmath49 in the eq.(4.10 ) with @xmath50 at @xmath51 and @xmath52 close to @xmath53 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the observed @xmath54 reproduces the eq.(4.9 ) : at low @xmath55 the observed negative sign of @xmath54 reflects the suppression of the spectral flow according to eq.(4.9 ) : @xmath56 .",
    "the observed upturn of @xmath54 demonstrates an increase of @xmath18 with increasing @xmath55 .",
    "the positive value of @xmath54 at @xmath45 shows that at these @xmath55 the spectral flow already dominates : @xmath57 . and finally at higher @xmath55 , where @xmath52 , the experimental @xmath54 approaches 1 , which shows that @xmath58 , ie the spectral flow reaches its extreme limit .",

    ", the topological defects appear due to the nonequilibrium dynamics of the phase ordering .",
    "the nonequilibrium processes take place because the cool - down through @xmath53 occurs with finite rate , as a result the order parameter fluctuations above @xmath53 are quenched below @xmath53 .",
    "the physics of the nonequilibrium phase transition in expanding universe is the same as in condensed matter , and thus may be modelled in the laboratory where the cooling rate can be controlled @xcite .",

    "the mean free path is 0.1 mm in liquid @xmath0he and thus all absorption reactions occur close to the walls of the container . since the incident thermal neutron has low momentum , the 573 kev proton and 191 kev triton fly apart in opposite directions , producing 70 and 10 @xmath63 m long ionization tracks , respectively .",
    "the subsequent charge recombination yields a ` primordial fireball '  a heated region of the normal liquid phase .",

    "was identified with the moment when the system cools below the ginzburg temperature @xmath79 above which the thermal fluctuations prevail , ie @xmath80 .",
    "this implies that the initial distance between the vortices is the coherence length at @xmath79 , i.e. @xmath81 , and does not depend on the cooling time @xmath82 . in superfluid @xmath0he the critical fluctuation region is extremely narrow , @xmath83 , because the zero temperature coherence length @xmath84 m is two orders of magnitude larger than the interatomic spacing @xmath85@xcite . as a result",

    "the friction is small and vortices have time to propagate into the bulk liquid before they collapse .",
    "the formed vortices can be effectively stabilized in the rotating container which produces the superfluid velocity @xmath108 near the wall ( here @xmath109 is the container radius and @xmath110 the rotation velocity ) .",
    "if the radius of the vortex loop exceeds the value @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the circulation quantum , the loop expands under the action of the magnus force .",
    "an expanding vortex ring eventually results in a rectilinear vortex line which is pulled to the centre of the container , where it is detected by nmr .",

    "the radius @xmath115 of the initial loops is smaller than the critical radius @xmath116 , that is why the formed vortex network remains in the bubble and the vortex cluster decays according to the general properties of the strings dynamics . if in this process the @xmath77 reaches @xmath116 , the vortices escape and are detected .",

    "this is in favour of the zurek modification of the kibble mechanism of defect formation .",
    "on the other hand it is difficult to find some other mechanism of the defect nucleation by neutron irradiation , which could be responsible for all the found phenomena , including that observed at low @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "it is believed now that the @xmath114 itself is not the reason of the vortex formation : @xmath114 mainly allows the formed vortices to escape , to expand and finally to reach a stable state in the rotating container so that they can be detected one by one . with increasing @xmath114 , smaller loops , which represent an earlier stage in the evolution of the network ,",
