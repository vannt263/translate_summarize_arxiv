    "the cometary globules in the helix nebula ( ngc  7293 ) are among the most remarkable structures seen in planetary nebulae ( pne ) .",
    "they occur in large numbers in the lower ionization regions of the nebula , and appear in high resolution optical images as small ( @xmath6 ) , convex , photo - ionized surfaces facing the central star , with comet - like tails extending in the opposite direction ( e.g. , meaburn et al . 1992 ; odell & handron 1996 ) .",
    "these structures are seen in other pne ( e.g. , odell et al . 2002 ) and are probably quite common , but they are best seen in the helix nebula because it is the nearest example , at a distance of @xmath7  pc ( @xmath8  mas , harris et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "a key step in understanding the nature of the helix globules has been their detection in co by huggins et al .",
    "( 1992 ) . with a resolution @xmath9",
    ", the co observations did not resolve their structure , but demonstrated that globules contain a major mass component of molecular gas , consistent with observations of dust , seen in absorption against the nebula emission by meaburn et al .",
    "the molecular gas places important constraints on the origin and evolution of the globules , and provides a direct connection with the massive shell of neutral gas that surrounds the ionized nebula ( forveille & huggins 1991 ; young et al .",
    "1999 ; rodriguez , goss , & williams 2002 ) .",
    "this connection is underscored by wide field imaging of the nebula in the infrared lines of h@xmath1 by kastner et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , cox et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and speck et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , at resolutions from 8  to 2 , that show a highly fragmented envelope .    in order to determine the detailed relation between the molecular gas and the structure of the globules revealed by optical images",
    ", we have made new observations of the helix nebula in both co and h@xmath1 with significantly better resolution than previous observations . in this _",
    "letter _ , we report results on the molecular gas in a single cometary globule that resolve its head - tail structure .",
    "the globule observed is a prominent feature lying within the ionized nebula to the north of the central star at offsets ( @xmath1010 , + 135 ) .",
    "it is designated c1 by huggins et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and its location is shown in fig .",
    "3a of meaburn et al .",
    "( 1998 ) where it is labeled `` 1 '' .",
    "optical images of the globule from walsh & meaburn ( 1993 ) in h@xmath11+[nii]6584  and in [ oiii]5007 , where it is seen in absorption against the nebular emission , are shown in the top right panels of fig .  1 .",
    "the co observations were made in the 2.6  mm ( 115  ghz ) @xmath0 line using the iram interferometer at plateau de bure , france , in may 1999 .",
    "the array consisted of five , 15  m antennas , equipped with sis heterodyne receivers .",
    "the observations were made with the d configuration of the array , with maximum baselines of @xmath12  m. the primary beam size of the interferometer is 44  at 2.6  mm , and the effective velocity resolution for the analysis is 0.2  kms@xmath5 .",
    "the uv data were fourier transformed and cleaned , using the clark algorithm , and the restored gaussian clean beam is @xmath13 , at a position angle of 14 .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "1 and 2 .    images of the h@xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 emission in the northern quadrant of the helix nebula were obtained with the sofi infrared camera on the eso ntt , in june , 2001 .",
    "the instrument has a 1024@xmath14 hawaii hgcdte array and was used with an image scale of 024 pixel@xmath5 .",
    "the seeing was 1 .",
    "the observations were made with an h@xmath1 filter of width 0.028  @xmath4 , centered at 2.124  @xmath4 , well separated from the hei 2@xmath15p@xmath162@xmath15s 2.058  @xmath4 and hi 2.166  @xmath4 lines , the latter having a transmission of a few percent in the filter passband .",
    "fifteen 1  min exposures were made , using sky offset positions at 5  n , 5  e , and 7  ne .",
    "the individual images were sky cleaned , flat fielded , and combined with shift - and - add registration using the brightest stellar images .",
    "many globules are detected in the full h@xmath1 image , and the region around globule c1 is shown in the top , center - left panel in fig .  1 . an approximate calibration has been made by comparing the smoothed , full image with the data of speck et al .",
    "the intensity of the emission at the head of the globule is @xmath17  ergs@xmath5@xmath18sr@xmath5 .",
    "astrometry of the h@xmath1 and optical images was carried out using stars in the usno catalog , and the registration between the images is @xmath19 rms .",
    "the accuracy of the absolute positions for comparison with the co interferometry is @xmath20 00 .",
    "the observations presented in fig .  1 provide complementary views of the helix globule .",
    "the co 10 line , with an upper level of @xmath21  k above the ground state , shows the overall distribution and kinematics of the cool molecular gas ; the high lying ( @xmath22  k ) h@xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 line traces excited molecular gas ; the image in [ oiii ] shows the distribution of dust , seen in absorption against the nebular emission ; and the image in h@xmath11+[nii ] shows the photo - ionized surfaces facing the central star",
    ".    the observations immediately confirm the molecular nature of the globule , and reveal some important details of its structure .      the co 10 velocity - integrated intensity map ( fig .",
    "1 ) is seen to be extended with respect to the telescope beam , and the deconvolved source size , assuming a gaussian distribution , is @xmath23 ( 1  corresponds to @xmath24  cm at 200  pc ) .",
    "the emission is marginally resolved in ra but is resolved in dec , and extends roughly along the head - tail axis of the globule .",
    "the peak intensity is 2.6  kkms@xmath5 , and the total flux is 166  kkms@xmath5arcsec@xmath14 .",
    "the co velocity - strip ( fig .  2 ) shows that to the south , toward the head of the globule , the line width is extremely narrow , @xmath25  kms@xmath5  ( fwhm ) , and it broadens out to @xmath26  kms@xmath5  farther north into the tail region .",
    "the co radial velocity is precisely determined to be @xmath27  kms@xmath5  ( the correction to @xmath28 is @xmath102.9  kms@xmath5 ) , consistent with @xmath29  kms@xmath5measured in [ nii ] 6584  by meaburn et al .",
    "the systemic velocity of the whole envelope of the helix nebula is @xmath1023  kms@xmath5  ( young et al . 1999 ) , so the globule is blue - shifted by @xmath30  kms@xmath5 . for a radial expansion velocity of the globule system of @xmath31  kms@xmath5",
    "( young et al . 1999 ) , the globule lies on the near side of the nebula , on a radius vector from the star inclined to the line of sight by @xmath32 . the head - tail axis , assumed radial , is also seen at this angle .",
    "the co channel maps ( fig .",
    "1 ) show the structure in the molecular gas .",
    "there are two peaks , offset 3  n and 8n from the field center .",
    "the first is just north of the maximum absorption in the [ oiii ] image ( centered at @xmath33n ) , and we identify this molecular emission with the head of the globule whose photo - ionized surface toward the central star is seen in the h@xmath11+[nii ] image .",
    "substantial co emission , however , extends away from the head into the tail region , and the second co peak lies close to a second , weak maximum in the dust absorption image ( at 8n ) .",
    "this extended co emission , together with the line broadening into the tail accounts for the offset of the peak in the co integrated intensity map from the head of the globule .",
    "these observations demonstrate that the molecular gas in the cometary globule is _ not _ a compact spheroidal bullet , but has a substantial component extending into the tail region .",
    "the distribution of the h@xmath1 emission in the globule is strikingly different from that of co ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the strongest h@xmath1 emission occurs at the face of the globule toward the central star .",
    "there is little emission directly behind the globule , but observable emission extends to large distances ( @xmath34 ) along the tail .",
    "remarkably , the h@xmath1 distribution most closely follows that of the ionized gas seen in h@xmath11+[nii ] .",
    "the high spatial resolution of our observations and the well defined geometry of the globule provide a unique perspective on the question of the excitation of the h@xmath1 ( cox et al .",
    "1998 ) , which affects its observed distribution .",
    "the bright h@xmath1 emission clearly arises in a thin surface layer in the molecular gas .",
    "3 shows a close - up of the globule head , comparing the h@xmath1 and h@xmath11+[nii ] emission with [ oiii ] . the h@xmath1 emission forms a limb - brightened cap on the globule facing the central star , and lies just inside ( 01 ) the halo of photo - ionized gas seen in h@xmath11+[nii ] . in the tail region too ( fig .  1 ) , the h@xmath1 is enhanced near two h@xmath11+[nii ] peaks , at 8n and 12n on the east side , which are directly illuminated by the star .",
    "more detailed observations are needed to determine whether these are separate , small globules along the line of sight , or sub - structures of the main tail .",
    "the observed distribution of the h@xmath1 emission is in complete accord with the expectations of h@xmath1 excitation in a thin photo - dissociation region ( pdr ) at the surface of the molecular gas .",
    "the observed intensity of the line is probably consistent with this interpretation ( natta & hollenbach 1998 ; speck et al .",
    "2002 ) although detailed pdr models of the globules have not yet been developed .",
    "the possibility that the observed distribution is caused by shocks is unlikely , in view of the small crossing time ( @xmath35  yr ) for shocks ( @xmath36  kms@xmath5 ) able to excite the @xmath37 @xmath3 h@xmath1 line ( e.g. , burton et al . 1992 ) ; shocks in the bulk of the molecular gas are ruled out by the absence of any disturbance in the co emission with velocities larger than @xmath38  kms@xmath5 .      using the co 21 observations of the globule by huggins et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , we find the 21/10 flux ratio to be @xmath20 23 ( assuming significant 10 flux is not resolved out on the shortest baselines ) , which suggests that the lines are at least partly optically thin , with an excitation temperature @xmath20 1840  k in the thin limit .",
    "for a representative value of 25  k and a co abundance of @xmath39 , the co 10 flux gives a mass of molecular gas in the globule of @xmath40  m@xmath41 .",
    "the corresponding average density in a volume with projected dimensions of @xmath42 , which includes the head and the tail seen in co , is @xmath43  @xmath44 .",
    "these values are consistent with a mass of @xmath45  m@xmath41  and @xmath46  @xmath44 determined for the head of the globule by meaburn et al .",
    "( 1992 ) from the dust absorption seen in [ oiii ] , corrected to a distance of 200  pc .",
    "the typical mass of photo - ionized gas at the surface of a globule , @xmath47  m@xmath41  ( e.g. , odell & handron 1996 ) , is negligible in comparison .",
    "the structure and kinematics of the molecular gas in the head and in the tail of the globule provide basic constraints on their origin and evolution .",
    "one scenario for the origin of globules is that they form in the atmosphere of the progenitor star and are carried out in the expanding circumstellar envelope ( dyson et al .",
    "1989 ) . in this case",
    ", the wind - swept appearance of the globules suggests a model in which material from the head is swept into the tail by a radially directed wind , and dyson , hartquist , & biro ( 1993 ) have shown that the wind needs to be subsonic to form a narrow tail .",
    "our observations constrain this model in showing no evidence for a wind - swept flow pattern at the present time .",
    "there is no difference in velocity between the co emission in the head and the tail of the globule , and from the co strip map ( fig .",
    "2 ) the differential motion is @xmath48  kms@xmath5along the line of sight , or @xmath49  kms@xmath5  in a radial direction , corrected for the inclination .",
    "this would produce a tail of length @xmath50 in 5,000  yr which is likely the maximum time available for such a process .",
    "the tails could have been fully formed at an earlier epoch , or it might be that ablation occurs only from the ionized edges of the head of the globule , but this would not account for the presence of molecular gas seen in h@xmath1 along the whole length of the tail .    a different view of the gas dynamics around the globule at the present time is provided by the photo - evaporation model , which has been discussed in the context of the helix globules by lpez - martn et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . in this model , photo - ionization of the neutral globule , whose molecular core is unambiguously confirmed by our observations , produces an ionized out - flow from the surface .",
    "given that the density of the ionized gas at the head of the globule is @xmath51  @xmath44 , and that of the ambient gas is much lower @xmath52  @xmath44 ( e.g. , odell & handron 1996 ) , any subsonic flow of the ambient gas around the globule is unlikely to have important dynamical effects in shaping the gas in the tail .",
    "an alternative mechanism for growing a tail on a pre - existing globule is by shadowing ( cant et al .",
    "1998 ) , which can form a tail behind the globule as the result of under - pressure of the gas in the shadowed region . for the simplest case of a neutral globule in ionized gas",
    ", this model produces only modest density increases in the tail , and is unlikely to lead to the substantial molecular tails revealed by the present observations .",
    "striking effects of shadowing of the ionizing radiation are , however , seen in optical images of the helix ( e.g. , henry , kwitter , & dufour 1999 ) , where long , radial plumes appear as extensions to globules and their tails .",
    "similar shadowing of the stellar radiation at wavelengths longer than the lyman limit must also occur , and the consequent reduction of the co and h@xmath1 photo - dissociation rates in the shadowed regions must play a key role in preserving the molecular gas in the extended tails .    if globules originate close to the star as proposed by dyson et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , the most crucial phase in their evolution occurs when they are overrun by the ionization front of the nebula . at this stage",
    ", the shadowing of pre - existing molecules or hydrodynamic flows , or both , could lead to globules with molecular tails .",
    "an alternative scenario is one in which the globules and their tails originate simultaneously in instabilities at the ionization front ( e.g. , capriotti 1973 ) . in this model , shadowing and possibly hydrodynamic flows would also likely play a role , and the fingers of gas which result from the instability could contribute directly to the formation of the tails .",
    "the later development of these two models will likely be similar , and can plausibly lead to the globules with substantial molecular tails that we now observe .",
    "further studies should allow us to discriminate between them .",
    "as for the fate of the globules , meaburn et al .",
    "( 1998 ) estimated an ablation rate for globule c1 of @xmath53  m@xmath41yr@xmath5 based on densities inferred from the [ oiii ] image , and an assumed ablation flow velocity of 10  kms@xmath5 .",
    "this implies an improbably short lifetime of @xmath54  yr which led meaburn et al . to consider ad hoc , restricted flow models around the globule .",
    "the absence of an observable ablation flow in the globule reported here for co ( @xmath55  kms@xmath5 ) completely resolves this problem , by increasing the original estimate of the ablation time scale by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "in fact , the current mass - loss rate of the globule is likely dominated by photo - evaporation ( lpez - martn et al .",
    "2001 ) , and the corresponding time scale is @xmath56  yr . thus the globules are long lived , and may even escape the nebula ."
