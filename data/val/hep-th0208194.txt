    "deformation quantization as a framework for quantum physics has many attractive features . after setting up a classical system as a commutative algebra of functions on phase space ,",
    "the passage to the corresponding quantum stystem is completely staightforward : the quantum observables are the same phase space functions as the classical observables .",
    "the only thing that changes is the product which is used to multiply phase space functions : in the quantum case one uses a _ star product _ instead of the commutative pointwise product of classical mechanics .",
    "the use of the star product produces all the characteristic quantum effects : non - commutativity , heisenberg uncertainty and nonlocality . for a recent review at an elementary level see ref .",

    "@xcite a few applications to non - relativistic quantum mechanics were known , but little concerning possible uses in relativistic quantum field theory .",
    "this situation has recently changed .",
    "after dito s work on star products and free scalar fields @xcite , dtsch and fredenhagen have studied the relation between deformation quantization and the algebraic approach to perturbative quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "deformation theory has been used to establish important results concerning the quantization of gauge field theories , including the mathematical reconstruction of the brst procedure @xcite and the batalin - vilkoviski formalism @xcite .",
    "cattaneo and felder @xcite have demonstrated a direct relationship between kontsevich s star product on a general poisson manifold @xcite and the perturbative expansion of the poisson - sigma model , which describes a two - dimensional topological field theory @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is threefold .",
    "firstly , we wish to demonstrate that the deformation quantization approach , besides its mathematically appealing features , provides a _ practical _ method for dealing with problems of quantum physics .",
    "secondly , we attempt to illuminate certain basic aspects of perturbative quantum field theory , by offering new insights into the structures which underlie the calculations .",
    "finally , although our work certainly does not render the recent more specialized applications referred to above any the less remarkable , it may make them appear less surprising .    in the present paper",
    "we give a systematic account of the passage from the quantum mechanics of systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom to field theory in the framework of deformation quantization .",
    "we then relate our results to the analogous formulae in the operator formalism .",
    "we find that star products provide a natural setting for various forms of wick s theorem , as well as the perturbative expansion of the time - evolution operator , which yields the feynman rules of quantum field theory .",
    "in contrast to systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom , in field theory requirements of freedom from divergences and causality dictate the use of specific star products and quantization schemes .",
    "in deformation quantization one starts from a classical system , that is , a poisson manifold @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a smooth manifold and @xmath2 the bivector which specifies the poisson structure .",
    "the classical observables are smooth real - valued functions on @xmath1 which form , by pointwise multiplication , the commutative algebra of observables .",
    "quantization involves a deformation of this algebra to a noncommutative associative algebra @xmath3 involving smooth complex - valued fuctions on @xmath1 which are multiplied by the use of a _ star product _ , defined as follows .",
