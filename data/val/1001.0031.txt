    "nearly a century after einstein s theory of general relativity was found to correctly predict the precession of the planet mercury around the sun and the deflection of light by the sun s gravitational field , the problem of understanding orbital trajectories around very massive objects still retains interest as it relates to current astrophysical topics [ 1 ] such as the study of gravitational waves . among the numerous works on this subject , we should mention the classic publications of whittaker [ 2 ] , hagihara [ 3 ] and chandrasekhar [ 4 ] on the schwarzschild geometry , and the more recent work of levin and perez - giz [ 5 ] on the schwarzschild and kerr geometries .    in the work of chandrasekhar and that of hagihara , the orbits are classified into various types according to the roots of a certain cubic equation , while in the work of levin and perez - giz , the orbits are classified topologically by a triplet of numbers that indicate the numbers of zooms , whirls and vertices . in the work of levin and perez - giz ,",
    "the orbits were obtained by numerically integrating the integrable equations .",
    "these authors used the planet s energy and angular momentum as the principal physical parameters , and made extensive use of an effective potential for describing the schwarzschild orbits , as most studies on the topics of general relativity do .    in this paper , we first present , in section 2 , three explicit analytic expressions for the orbits in the schwarzschild geometry : one is for periodic orbits [ 6 ] ( including a special case that we call asymptotic ) , and two are terminating orbits .",
    "the explicit analytic expressions that we derive not only describe the precise features of the orbits ( periodic , precessing , non - periodic , terminating , etc . ) but also clearly indicate two physical parameters which can be used to characterize these orbits .",
    "these two dimensionless parameters are specific combinations of the following physical quantities : the total energy and angular momentum of the planet , the masses of the massive object and the planet , and , of course , the universal gravitation constant @xmath0 and the speed of light @xmath1 .",
    "these two physical dimensionless parameters were first used by one of us in ref.6 .",
    "we shall refer to these two quantities as the energy eccentricity parameter @xmath2 and the gravitational field parameter @xmath3 respectively ( or simply as the energy parameter and the field parameter ) .",
    "they will be defined in section 2 .",
    "we will use neither the common convention of setting @xmath4 , nor the energy and angular momentum of the planet by themselves , as the physical parameters for characterizing the orbits . with the energy parameter @xmath5 plotted on the horizontal axis and the field parameter @xmath6 plotted on the vertical axis",
    ", the parameter space for all possible orbits will be shown to be divisible into three sectors , which we call regions i , ii and ii , that have clearly defined boundaries .",
    "region i permits periodic and terminating orbits .",
    "regions ii and ii terminating orbits only .    in section 3 ,",
    "we describe region i for the orbits in greater detail .",
    "we first divide region i by lines each of which represents orbits described by elliptic functions of the same modulus @xmath7 .",
    "we then give a more physical division of region i which consists of nearly horizontal lines each of which represents orbits that have the same precession angle @xmath8 , and of bent vertical lines each of which represents orbits that have the same `` true '' eccentricity @xmath9 .",
    "the terminating orbits will be characterized by two parameters one of which is the angle at which the planet enters the center of the blackhole , and the other being the initial distance of the planet from the star or blackhole . in sections 4 and 5",
    ", we describe regions ii and ii in which all orbits are terminating , and we again divide region ii by curves of constant modulus @xmath7 each of which describes orbits with the same modulus .",
    "regions ii and ii are separated by the schwarzschild horizon .",
    "thus the grid of our `` map '' can be used to describe all possible orbits in the schwarzschild geometry in their entirety .",
    "the observational data related to a planet s orbit about some giant star or blackhole can be directly identified with a point having certain coordinates @xmath10 on our map , which can then be used for estimating the physical characteristics associated with the star or blackhole and that of the planet itself , assuming that the star or blackhole is not spinning very fast . for the kerr geometry , another dimensionless quantity , which is clearly the ratio of the spin angular momentum per unit mass of the blackhole to the orbital angular momentum per unit mass of the planet , should enter into the consideration . in section 6 ,",
    "we briefly discuss a possible extension of our results to the case involving a slowly spinning blackhole , at least to the first order perturbation , by rescaling the physical parameters involved .    in section 7 , we study the deflection of light by the gravitational field of a very massive object .",
    "a single dimensionless parameter will be used to characterize the region .",
    "we show that here too , we should divide the region into three sectors , which we again call regions i , ii and ii , and we present three analytic expressions for the trajectories of light applicable in these different regions .",
    "region i has trajectories of light that get deflected , and regions ii and ii have trajectories of light that are absorbed by and terminate at the blackhole .    in section 8 , we give a summary of our results .",
    "proofs of many interesting analytic relations among the parameters appearing in these studies are given in several appendices . since our results presented in this paper cover gravitational fields of all ranges , from the weak field produced by the sun of our solar system , for example , to the very strong field produced by a blackhole",
    ", we want to avoid referring to the massive object that produces the gravitational field as a blackhole , and prefer to refer to it as the star or blackhole , and we shall refer to the object of a much smaller mass that orbits around it as the planet or the particle .",
    "we have supplemented our many analytic results with numerous tables that present various physical quantities such as the minimum and maximum distances of the planet from the star and the angles of precession of the orbits that are calculated from our analytic expressions , as well as numerous figures that show various kinds of orbits of the planet and various kinds of deflection of light .",
    "we consider the schwarzschild geometry , i.e. the static spherically symmetric gravitational field in the empty space surrounding some massive spherical object such as a star or a blackhole of mass @xmath11 .",
    "the schwarzschild metric for the empty spacetime outside a spherical body in the spherical coordinates @xmath12 is [ 1 ]    @xmath13    where    @xmath14    is known as the schwarzschild radius , @xmath0 is the universal gravitation constant , and @xmath1 is the speed of light . if @xmath15=(t , r,\\theta , \\phi ) $ ] , then the worldline @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the proper time along the path , of a particle moving in the equatorial plane @xmath18 , satisfies the equations [ 1 ]    @xmath19    @xmath20    @xmath21    where the derivative @xmath22 represents @xmath23 .",
    "the constant @xmath24 is identified as the angular momentum per unit mass of the planet , and the constant @xmath25 is identified to be    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the total energy of the planet in its orbit and @xmath28 is the rest mass of the planet at @xmath29 . substituting eqs.(3 ) and",
    "( 5 ) into ( 4 ) gives the combined energy equation [ 1 ]    @xmath30    substituting @xmath31 into the combined energy equation gives the differential equation for the orbit of the planet    @xmath32    where @xmath33 ,  @xmath34 ,  @xmath35 .",
    "following whittaker [ 2 ] , it is convenient to change variable from @xmath36 to a dimensionless quantity @xmath37 defined by    @xmath38    or @xmath39 so that eq.(7 ) becomes    @xmath40    where    @xmath41    and where    @xmath42 ^{1/2}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath43    the two dimensionless parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which are defined by the two above equations and which we call the energy and field parameters respectively , will be the principal parameters we shall use for characterizing the orbit of a planet .",
    "it will be noted that the constant @xmath44 which is @xmath45 for a bound orbit , can be identified with @xmath46 in the newtonian limit , where @xmath47 is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies and is @xmath45 for a bound orbit , and @xmath48 is the mass of the planet ( which approaches @xmath28 ) , and that    @xmath49 ^{1/2}\\ ] ]    is the `` eccentricity '' of the orbit .",
    "also , in the small @xmath3 limit , the orbit equation can be shown to be given by    @xmath50,\\ ] ]    where @xmath51 .",
    "thus @xmath52 assumes the same value when @xmath53 increases to @xmath54 . comparing this with the increase of @xmath53 from @xmath53 to @xmath55",
    ", the ellipse will rotate about the focus by an amount which is the angle of precession    @xmath56    this is the well known approximate expression for the precession angle for the case of very small @xmath3 .",
    "the limiting case for @xmath57 is the well known orbit equation in newtonian mechanics .",
    "we should note that while the limit @xmath58 ( and thus @xmath57 ) can not be strictly correct in principle so long as @xmath59 , this limit can be used for many practical cases with great accuracy as evidenced by the predictions of newtonian mechanics .",
    "a special case of these newtonian orbits is the circular orbit of radius @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "we now derive the exact analytic solutions of eq.(9 ) and classify the three possible solutions from a purely mathematical viewpoint , and we shall consider their physical interpretations in the next section .",
    "we first define the discriminant @xmath62 of the cubic equation    @xmath63    by    @xmath64    the three roots of the cubic equation ( 16 ) are all real for the case @xmath65 .",
    "we call the three roots @xmath66 and arrange them so that @xmath67 ; the special cases when two of the roots are equal will be considered also . for the case",
    "@xmath68 , the cubic equation ( 16 ) has one real root and two roots that are complex conjugates .",
    "the analytic solutions of eq.(9 ) that we shall present will give the distance @xmath52 of the planet from the star or blackhole in terms of the jacobian elliptic functions that have the polar angle @xmath53 in their argument and that are associated with a modulus @xmath7 that will be defined .",
    "instead of writing @xmath52 , we use the dimensionless distance @xmath69 measured in units of the schwarzschild radius @xmath70 and defined by    @xmath71    the dimensionless distance @xmath69 is related to @xmath37 of eq.(8 ) by    @xmath72    we now give the three analytic solutions of eq.(9 ) in the following .",
    "solution ( a1 ) for @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "writing the right - hand side of eq.(9 ) as @xmath75 , eq.(9 ) can be integrated with @xmath53 expressed in terms of the inverse jacobian @xmath76 function [ 7 ] . after a little algebra and some rearrangement , the equation for the orbit",
    "is found to be    @xmath77    where the point at @xmath78 has been chosen to give @xmath79 .",
    "the constant @xmath80 appearing in the argument , and the modulus @xmath7 , of the jacobian elliptic functions are given in terms of the three roots of the cubic equation ( 16 ) by    @xmath81    where @xmath66 are given by    @xmath82    and where    @xmath83    equation ( 20 ) was first given in ref.6 using a slightly different approach that was initiated by whittaker [ 2 ] .",
    "in addition , eq.(20 ) was shown to reduce to eq.(14 ) for the case of very small @xmath3 which in turn gave the known approximate precession angle given by eq.(15 ) .",
    "the modulus @xmath7 of the elliptic functions has a range @xmath84 .",
    "since the elliptic functions @xmath76 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are all periodic functions of @xmath53 for @xmath87 , we shall call this solution for the orbit the periodic solution . for the special case of @xmath88 , since @xmath89 , @xmath90 , the solution is no longer periodic , and we shall refer to it as the asymptotic periodic solution .",
    "the period of @xmath91 is @xmath92 , and the period of @xmath93 and of @xmath94 is @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind [ 7 ] . for @xmath97 , @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 .",
    "as @xmath101 increases from @xmath102 to @xmath103 , @xmath96 increases from @xmath104 to @xmath105 .",
    "the distance @xmath52 of the planet from the center of the star or blackhole assumes the same value when its polar angle @xmath53 increases from @xmath53 to @xmath106 .",
    "comparing this with the increase of @xmath53 from @xmath53 to @xmath107 in one revolution , the perihelion ( or the aphelion ) will rotate by an amount    @xmath108    which is the exact expression for the precession angle . for @xmath101 close to the value @xmath103",
    ", the planet can make many revolutions around the star or blackhole before assuming a distance equal to its initial distance .",
    "thus if @xmath109 is the largest integer for which @xmath110 is equal to or greater than @xmath111 , the angle of precession should be more appropriately defined as @xmath112 . for the sake of consistency , however , we shall stick to the definition given by eq.(25 ) .    for the case of very small @xmath3 and to the order of @xmath113 ,",
    "it was shown in ref.6 that @xmath114/2 $ ] , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and substituting these into eq.(25 ) gives the well known approximate result given by eq.(15 ) .",
    "for these periodic orbits , we note that the maximum distance @xmath117 ( the aphelion ) of the planet from the star or blackhole and the minimum distance @xmath118 ( the perihelion ) of the planet from the star or blackhole , or their corresponding dimensionless forms @xmath119 @xmath120 and @xmath121 @xmath122 are obtained from eq.(20 ) when @xmath123 and when @xmath124 respectively , and they are given by    @xmath125    and    @xmath126    where @xmath127 and @xmath128 are determined from eqs.(23 ) , ( 24 ) and ( 10 ) in terms of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "although we call the orbits given by this solution for @xmath129 periodic , they are not necessarily closed orbits .",
    "it is seen from the precession discussed above that for @xmath130 , unless @xmath131 is a rational number , the orbit will not close and it is not strictly a closed periodic orbit .",
    "however , for all practical purposes , any irrational number when truncated becomes a rational number , and thus the orbit will be closed .",
    "the distinction of closed and non - closed orbits depending on whether @xmath131 is rational or irrational is of course of profound theoretical interest [ 5 ] .    for a general periodic orbit that precesses",
    ", the general or true eccentricity @xmath9 of the orbit is defined by    @xmath132    where @xmath119 and @xmath121 are given by eqs.(26 ) and ( 27 ) .",
    "we shall show in the following section that the true eccentricity @xmath133 is in general not equal to the energy eccentricity parameter @xmath134 defined by eq.(11 ) , but that @xmath135 in the limit of @xmath136 , i.e. in the newtonian limit .",
    "for the special case of @xmath137 however , we shall show that it coincides with the special case of @xmath138 for all applicable values of @xmath3 , and that it signifies an unbounded orbit .",
    "we now proceed to present the second solution .",
    "solution ( a2 ) for @xmath73 , @xmath139 .",
    "we write the right - hand side of eq.(9 ) as @xmath140 and eq.(9 ) can be integrated with @xmath53 expressed in term of the inverse jacobian @xmath76 function [ 7 ] .",
    "the equation for the orbit is found to be    @xmath141    where @xmath80 , @xmath7 , @xmath142 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 are given by eqs.(21)-(24 ) as in the first solution .",
    "this solution gives a terminating orbit .",
    "the point at @xmath78 has been chosen to be given by    @xmath143    the planet , starting from the polar angle @xmath78 at a distance @xmath144 from the blackhole , plunges into the center of the blackhole when its polar angle @xmath145 is given by @xmath146 , i.e. when    @xmath147    where @xmath80 and @xmath7 are given by eqs.(21 ) and ( 22 ) .",
    "the region of @xmath10 where orbits given by solutions a1 and a2 are applicable will be called region i , and it will be described in greater detail in section 3 . thus each point @xmath10 of parameter space in region i represents two distinct orbits , one periodic and one terminating . at the same coordinate point ,",
    "the characteristic quantities that describe the two distinct orbits are related .",
    "for example , by noting @xmath148 and from eqs.(26 ) and ( 27 ) , @xmath144 can be expressed as    @xmath149    where @xmath121 and @xmath119 are the minimum and maximum distances for the periodic orbit at the same coordinate points @xmath10 .",
    "it will be noted that @xmath144 is less than @xmath121 , i.e. for the terminating orbit the planet is assumed initially to be closer to the blackhole than the @xmath150 for the associated periodic orbit , except at @xmath88 where @xmath151 and the planet has a circular instead of a terminating orbit that will be explained later .",
    "we note that the terminating orbit equation ( 29 ) presented has no singularity at the schwarzschild horizon @xmath152 , because , as is well known , @xmath153 is a coordinate singularity and not a physical singularity .",
    "the orbit obtained from continuing @xmath53 beyond the value @xmath154 may become interesting if the concept of `` whitehole '' turns out to be of physical relevance .    for now ,",
    "the orbits in region i are characterized mathematically by @xmath65 .",
    "we now present the third solution .",
    "solution ( b ) for @xmath68 .",
    "define    @xmath155    where @xmath156 and @xmath62 are defined by eqs.(10 ) and ( 17 ) .",
    "the real root of the cubic equation ( 16 ) is given by    @xmath157    and the two complex conjugate roots @xmath158 and @xmath159 are @xmath160 .",
    "we further define    @xmath161^{1/4}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath162    writing the right - hand side of eq.(9 ) , with @xmath163 , as @xmath164 , eq.(9 ) can be integrated with @xmath53 expressed in terms of the inverse jacobian @xmath85 function [ 7 ] .",
    "we find the equation for the orbit to be    @xmath165    this is a terminating orbit .",
    "the initial distance @xmath166 of the planet at @xmath167 has been chosen to be given by    @xmath168    it plunges into the center of the blackhole when its polar angle @xmath169 is given by    @xmath170    where @xmath80 and @xmath7 are given by eqs.(34 ) and ( 35 ) .",
    "again , we note that the orbit equation ( 36 ) has no singularity at @xmath152 .",
    "the region of @xmath10 where orbits given by eq.(36 ) are applicable will be divided into two sectors called regions ii and ii , the boundary between which will be defined later .",
    "they have terminating orbits only . for now , the orbits in regions ii and ii are characterized mathematically by @xmath68 .    as for the initial points of the orbits discussed above , by comparing eq.(19 ) with the orbit equations ( 20 ) , ( 29 ) and ( 36 ) , and with eqs.(26 ) , ( 30 ) and ( 37 ) , we already noted that our choice of @xmath78 in our orbit equations is such that it gives @xmath79 , @xmath142 , and @xmath171 respectively that in turn give @xmath172 , @xmath144 , and @xmath166 as the initial distances of the planet from the star or blackhole .",
    "we then note from eq.(9 ) that @xmath173 and hence @xmath174 for the planet at these initial points of the trajectories , i.e. the trajectory or more precisely the tangent to the trajectory at @xmath78 is perpendicular to the line joining the planet to the star or blackhole .",
    "all this will be seen in the figures presented later , and all our references to the initial position of the planet from here onward assume that the trajectory ( as @xmath53 increases from @xmath102 ) of the planet at its initial position is perpendicular to the line joining the planet to the star or blackhole .",
    "consider the orbits expressed by eqs.(20 ) and ( 29 ) given by solutions a1 and a2 and characterized mathematically by @xmath73 .",
    "we call the region covered by the associated range of values for @xmath10 region i.    to gain a preliminary perspective , consider the earth ( as the planet ) and the sun ( as the star ) in our solar system . substituting the mass of the sun @xmath175 and the angular momentum of the earth per unit mass of the earth @xmath176 , we find @xmath177 .",
    "the energy eccentricity parameter @xmath2 , which is equal to the true eccentricity @xmath9 of the earth s orbit for such a very small @xmath3 value , is known to be about @xmath178 .",
    "the approximate relation @xmath179 gives the squared modulus of the elliptic functions that describe the earth s orbit to be @xmath180 .",
    "we see that for the planetary system that is familiar to us , the values of @xmath3 and @xmath101 are very small indeed .",
    "we may also note that the schwarzschild radius @xmath181 @xmath182 would be well inside the sun which has a radius of @xmath183 .",
    "the earth s dimensionless distance is @xmath184 from the sun s center . for",
    "this value of @xmath3 , with @xmath185 , the orbit given by eq.(29 ) from solution a2 would require the initial position @xmath144 of a planet to be @xmath186 according to eq.(31 ) , i.e. the planet would have to be at a distance equal to the schwarzschild radius from the center of the sun for it to have a terminating orbit which plunges to the center of the sun . therefore the terminating orbit given by eq.(29 ) is inapplicable for our solar system .",
    "the periodic orbits , on the other hand , are perfectly valid .",
    "however , for cases when the massive object is a gigantic mass concentrated in a small radius such as a blackhole , all the possibilities presented here may arise . as the field parameter @xmath3 increases from @xmath102 , the modulus @xmath7 of the elliptic functions that describe the planet s orbits also increases . from eqs.(21)-(24 )",
    ", it is seen that several steps are needed to relate @xmath187 to @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in appendix",
    "a , we show that a direct relationship between @xmath101 and @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be established , and it is given by    @xmath188    the @xmath189 of eq.(39 ) is the same @xmath189 that appears in eq.(24 ) , and , in particular , it is equal to @xmath190 for @xmath191 respectively .    the curve represented by @xmath88 , after setting @xmath192 in eq.(39 ) , can be readily shown to give a quadratic equation @xmath193 that gives    @xmath194    for @xmath195 , and @xmath196 for @xmath138 .",
    "equation ( 40 ) representing @xmath197 gives the upper boundary ( for the values of @xmath3 ) of region i ( the uppermost heavy solid line in fig.1 ) ; it extends from @xmath198 for @xmath61 to @xmath199 for @xmath138 , i.e. a line that is nearly parallel to the @xmath2-axis .",
    "thus region i is a region bounded by @xmath200 , and by @xmath201 where @xmath202 is given by eq.(40 ) , in which the squared modulus of the elliptic functions that describe the orbits cover the entire range @xmath84 .",
    "we now use eq.(38 ) to give a plot of lines of constant @xmath203 as shown in fig.1 .",
    "these lines conveniently divide region i into regions of increasing field strengths as @xmath101 increases from @xmath102 to @xmath103 . on a point representing a particular @xmath101 and a particular @xmath2 value ,",
    "@xmath3 can be determined from eq.(38 ) and the orbit is then given by eq.(20 ) using eqs.(98 ) , ( 10 ) and ( 21 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath3 on these constant @xmath101 lines for the values of @xmath204 are given in table 1 which thus give the coordinates @xmath10 of the points on the lines representing different values of @xmath101 .",
    "these coordinate points @xmath205 from table 1 are used to give the following tables : tables 2 and 3 give the values of @xmath119 and @xmath121 for the orbits obtained from eqs.(26 ) and ( 27 ) .",
    "note that the dimensionless distance @xmath69 is in units of the schwarzschild radius @xmath70 which depends on the mass @xmath11 of the star or blackhole corresponding to that particular coordinate point , and thus one should not compare @xmath69 at two different coordinate points just by their absolute values alone .",
    "table 4 presents the values of the precession angle in units of @xmath206 , i.e. @xmath207 , obtained from eq.(25 ) .",
    "table 5 presents the values of the true eccentricity @xmath9 obtained from eq.(28 ) .",
    "tables 2 - 5 are to be used in conjunction with table 1 for identifying the locations @xmath10 of the corresponding quantities that are presented .",
    "the physical quantities presented in tables 2 - 5 together with the coordinates @xmath10 given in table 1 now give all possible periodic orbits in the schwarzschild geometry in its entirety .",
    "that is , the coordinates @xmath205 of a planet orbiting a non - spinning blackhole can be identified if the observation data on @xmath208 and @xmath8 can be collected .",
    "region i shown in fig.1 is where orbits given by eqs.(20 ) and ( 29 ) apply . in sections 4 and 5",
    ", we shall discuss regions ii and ii which are shown above region i in fig.2 where orbits given by eq.(36 ) apply .",
    "as an example of application of tables 1 - 5 , from the second row and second column of tables 1 - 5 and using only two significant figures , for orbits with @xmath209 we find from tables 2 - 5 that @xmath210 or @xmath211 and @xmath212 , i.e. orbits with those seemingly small values of @xmath3 and @xmath101 give a precession angle of @xmath213 per revolution that is already very large compared to those encountered in our solar system for which the precession angle is only @xmath214 per century for the earth s orbit ( for which @xmath215 ) , and the value of the true eccentricity @xmath9 of these orbits is already quite different from their energy parameter @xmath2 .",

    "thus @xmath555 which results in    @xmath556    from eq.(24 ) , which in turn gives a simple relationship    @xmath557    for example , we have @xmath558 for @xmath61 , and @xmath559 for @xmath138 ( using lhospital rule ) .",
    "these two values represent the two terminal coordinates of the constant @xmath244 line in region i ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the other solution of eq.(106 ) is eq.(58 ) which is applicable for region ii as we shall show later in this appendix .",
    "we also find from eq.(23 ) that    @xmath560    and    @xmath561{g_{2}},\\ ] ]    and the orbit equation ( 20 ) becomes    @xmath562    where the @xmath3 value for @xmath259 in this case is given by eq.(107 ) for region i. the precession angle @xmath8 can be found from eq.(25 ) and from @xmath563 .",
    "it is given by    @xmath564{g_{2}}}-2.\\ ] ]    from eqs.(26)-(28 ) and ( 108 ) , we find    @xmath565    which can be inverted and solved for @xmath3 in terms of @xmath9 , giving    @xmath566    substituting eq.(111 ) into eq.(106 ) gives @xmath2 in terms of @xmath9 as    @xmath567    since for @xmath61 , @xmath568 when @xmath244 as we showed above , substituting this @xmath3 value into eq.(106 ) gives @xmath569 . for @xmath138 , @xmath570 when @xmath245 , and substituting this @xmath3 value into eq.(106 ) gives @xmath571 as it should .",
    "thus eqs.(111 ) and ( 112 ) are the parametric equations for the line of constant @xmath244 which can be used instead of eq.(107 ) as @xmath133 takes the values between @xmath572 and @xmath103 .    also , substituting @xmath573 from eq.(108 ) into eq.(27 )",
    "gives    @xmath574    independent of @xmath2 for @xmath244 , as shown in table 3 .",
    "we now consider @xmath244 in region ii . from eqs.(35 ) and ( 33 ) , we have    @xmath575    from eq.(32 ) , and from @xmath576 , and @xmath577 , we arrive again at eq.(106 ) with the same @xmath156 given by eq.(10 ) .",
    "this explains why we stated after eq.(107 ) that the other solution of eq.(106 ) given by eq.(58 ) gives the relation between @xmath3 and @xmath2 for region ii .",
    "the two equations ( 108 ) and ( 58 ) that give simple relations between @xmath3 and @xmath2 in two different regions and that arise as two different solutions of the same equation ( 106 ) show a rather remarkable symmetry exhibited by the special case @xmath244 .",
    "it also follows from eqs.(32 ) and ( 34 ) that    @xmath578    @xmath579 ^{1/4},\\ ] ]    and that the orbit equation ( 36 ) becomes    @xmath580    where the @xmath3 value for the above equations is given by eq.(58 ) for @xmath200 .    since @xmath581 ,",
    "the initial distance @xmath166 of the planet from the blackhole is @xmath582 from eq.(37 ) , independent of @xmath2 , as shown in table 10 .",
    "on the upper boundary @xmath583 of region ii , the planet starts from the schwarzschild horizon given by @xmath152 , which implies that for @xmath78 , @xmath316 from eq.(36 ) , or                                    finally , there is a special case of @xmath594 or @xmath361 ( @xmath595 ) in region ii that is somewhat interesting . if @xmath259 of eq.(10 ) is equal to zero , then @xmath596 from eq.(17 ) , and from eqs.(32)-(35 ) , we find @xmath597 , @xmath598 , @xmath599 , @xmath600 , and noting that @xmath601 for @xmath361 and @xmath222 , we have      which is independent of @xmath2 , i.e. the constant @xmath603 curve in region ii just above the boundary curve of regions i and ii in fig.2 is a horizontal line . thus the terminating orbits represented by eq.(36 ) for any point along this horizontal line are represented by elliptic functions of the same squared modulus given above .",
    "it should be remembered , however , that the orbits and the initial positions of the planet ( the initial trajectory of which is perpendicular to the line joining it to the blackhole ) depend also on @xmath80 and @xmath171 that are dependent on the value of @xmath2 .",
    "thus the orbit for @xmath138 , for example , that gives @xmath604 ( and @xmath605 ) is a terminating orbit for a planet that is initially infinitely far away from a blackhole ."
