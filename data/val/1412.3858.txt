    "the year 2015 has been declared by un and unesco as the `` international year of light '' @xcite which commemorates the achievements of light sciences .",
    "simultaneously , the year 2015 is the centenary year of general relativity .",
    "light bending is a genuine effect of general relativity ( at least when we confront the theoretical prediction with observations ) and was the first experimental confirmation of the newly discovered theory which , looking back , is quite an achievement .",
    "it seems therefore timely to revive the subject of light motion on curved backgrounds by including new interesting examples of recently emerged metrics and generalizing or improving / correcting existing analytical results .    to appreciate the development of the subject",
    "let us recall that the idea of light bending can be traced back to newton s _ opticks _ @xcite which concludes with a number of queries . in query 1",
    "@xcite newton states : _",
    "`` do not bodies act upon light at a distance , and by their action bend its rays , and is not this action ( caeteris paribus ) strongest at the least distance''_. however , according to @xcite the first concrete calculation within the newtonian framework was done by henry cavendish in 1784 , but the result remained unpublished .",
    "twenty years later johann georg von soldner has done a similar calculation @xcite and taking into account that both these calculations assume a different position of the light source ( cavendish light is emitted at infinity whereas soldner s comes form a surface of a gravitating body ) , both results agree in the first order approximation @xcite .",
    "moreover , the result , @xmath0 ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the mass and radius of the sun ) , is half the value obtained from general relativity using the schwarzschild metric .",
    "einstein first attempt to calculate the effect of gravity on light yielded the same value obtained by cavendish and soldner as he also used the newtonian theory by invoking the energy - mass equivalence . only in 1916",
    "he obtained what is now considered the correct result ( twice the newtonian value ) within the framework of general relativity . using the robertson expansion of the metric the deflection angle can be parametrized as @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the closest approach ) .",
    "the most precise experiments on quasars using very long baseline radio interference gives @xmath5 @xcite , an impressive result which excludes the newtonian value @xmath6 and confirms general relativity .",
    "of course , the above mentioned theoretical result in general relativity is only the very first approximation in the schwarzschild metric .",
    "more accurate expansions are possible and will be presented in this paper .",
    "the result is valid up to @xmath7 based on expansion of incomplete elliptic integrals of the first kind .",
    "a more pronounced effect of light bending is gravitational lensing .",
    "the idea is usually attributed to einstein @xcite , but has been already published twelve years earlier by chwolson @xcite . since",
    "then the field has achieved a remarkable level , from the observational as well as from theoretical point of view @xcite reaching a high mathematical sophistication @xcite . in spite of the seniority of the subject , one can still find some niches where an improvement is possible .",
    "as far as the lensing in the schwarzschild metric is concerned we offer some corrections of expressions existing in the literature and generalization of the formulae .",
    "another metric , closely related to the schwarzschild metric , is the kottler or schwarzschild - de sitter metric which includes a positive cosmological constant .",
    "the interest in this metric was revived after the accelerated stage of the expansion of the universe was discovered and a positive cosmological constant could account for the observational data .",
    "a natural question arises : does the cosmological constant , given its `` measured value '' affect the properties of light deflection ? this led to some controversy in the literature regarding the observability of the cosmological constant in the lensing . considering that with the inclusion of the cosmological constant two different scales appear in the theory , it is a priori not excluded that an effect combines these two scales in a way that it becomes , in principle , measurable .",
    "this does not seem to happen for the cosmological constant at least as far as lensing is concerned .",
    "our result contains the cosmological constant , but the effect is tiny . in deriving this result",
    "we made sure that our expressions reduce to the formulae encountered in the schwarzschild metric when we put the cosmological constant to zero .    in the whole paper we probe into the light motion around naked singularities .",
    "one case studied in detail is the janis - newman - winicour ( jnw ) metric .",
    "one of the interest is to get an insight of motion of light in naked singularities . in the case of the jnw metric",
    "we concentrate on generalization of existing results , but embed the jnw results also in a wider context . with a simple qualitative tool we can show that in many cases of naked singularities ( apart from the jnw metric , we examine three other naked singularities ) a narrow range of possible parameters leads to bound states of light .",
    "the relevance of lensing is , of course , manifold .",
    "but it is probably its connection to dark matter ( dm ) @xcite which led the area to the avenues of new physics .",
    "based on the non - relativistic dark matter density of navarro - frankel - simon a general relativistic metric has been derived earlier which makes it possible to study the deflection of light in the galactic dm halos from the scratch .",
    "we offer here the first results of such a study .",
    "next we focus on a class of metrics which have been derived having in mind some models of quantum gravity . to be specific",
    ", we calculate the light deflection angle for two black hole ( bh ) metrics : the holographic screen and the dirty bh inspired by noncommutative geometry .",
    "the dirty bh contains in a limit the case of a noncommutative bh when the parameters are chosen accordingly .",
    "these metrics are based on the fact that noncommutativity , i.e. , @xmath8=i\\theta^{\\mu \\nu}$ ] , leads to smeared objects in place of point - like particles @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the holographic screen metric has been obtained by `` reversed engineering '' demanding that the metric has no curvature singularity and `` self - implements '' the characteristic length scale .",
    "it is , of course , of some interest to see how light behaves in exotic metrics like the worm hole metric and mini bh metrics which include aspects of noncommutative geometry .    the choice of the metrics to study the light deflection covers a wide range : from the standard general relativistic metrics of bhs over a naked singularity and a dm galactic halo metric to metrics inspired by some aspects of quantum gravity out of which one is a worm hole .",
    "we hope to have added to the subject of light bending in gravitational fields some new insight by studying these examples .",
    "we consider a static and radially symmetric gravitational field represented by the line element ( @xmath9 ) @xmath10\\ ] ] with @xmath11 , @xmath12 $ ] , and @xmath13 .",
    "we further suppose that the functions @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are at least @xmath17 times continuously differentiable on some interval @xmath18 .",
    "the corresponding relativistic kepler problem is defined by the geodesic equation @xmath19 for the metric ( [ 25.3 ] ) and the relation @xmath20 if we compute the christoffel symbols we find that the geodesic equation gives rise to the following system of ordinary differential equations @xmath21 equation ( [ 25.7 ] ) can be solved by imposing that @xmath22 .",
    "there is no loss in generality in introducing this condition since at a certain point in time the coordinate system can be rotated in such a way that @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "then , the coordinate and velocity vectors will belong to the equatorial plane @xmath22 .",
    "this implies that @xmath24 and hence @xmath25 . as a consequence",
    "the whole trajectory will belong to the equatorial plane and equation ( [ 25.8 ] ) becomes @xmath26 the above equation can be immediately integrated and we obtain @xmath27 we can also motivate the choice @xmath22 and equation ( [ 25.11 ] ) with the help of the isotropy of the problem at hand .",
    "this approach is usually adopted in the treatment of the nonrelativistic kepler problem where the angular momentum @xmath28 is conserved because of the isotropy of the problem .",
    "since the direction of @xmath28 is constant , we can choose the coordinate system in such a way that @xmath29 .",
    "this is equivalent to require that @xmath22 . since the magnitude of @xmath28 is constant , equation ( [ 25.11 ] ) will hold .",
    "hence , the integration constant can be interpreted as the angular momentum per unit mass , i.e. @xmath30 .",
    "let us write ( [ 25.5 ] ) in the form @xmath31=0.\\ ] ] integrating the above equation we obtain @xmath32 if we set @xmath22 and use ( [ 25.11 ] ) and ( [ 25.13 ] ) in ( [ 25.6 ] ) , as a result we get the equation @xmath33}{2r^3 a(r)c^2(r)}=0.\\ ] ] multiplication by @xmath34 yields @xmath35=0.\\ ] ] one more integration finally gives @xmath36 this radial equation can be seen as the most important equation of motion since the angular motion is completely specified by ( [ 25.11 ] ) and the condition @xmath22 whereas the connection between @xmath37 and @xmath38 is fixed by ( [ 25.13 ] ) . if we integrate ( [ 25.16 ] ) once more we obtain @xmath39 and if we substitute this function into ( [ 25.11 ] ) and ( [ 25.13 ] ) , we get after integration @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "elimination of the parameter @xmath38 yields @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "together with @xmath22 they represent the full solution of the problem .",
    "the involved integrals can not be in general solved in terms of elementary functions . to determine @xmath44 , we rewrite ( [ 25.2 ] ) as @xmath45 where in the last inequality we used the condition @xmath22 together with ( [ 25.11 ] ) , ( [ 25.13 ] ) and ( [ 25.16 ] ) . from ( [ 25.17 ] ) and ( [ 25.2 ] ) it follows that @xmath46 we want to determine the trajectory @xmath47 in the equatorial plane @xmath22 .",

    "the plus and minus sign must be chosen for particles approaching the gravitational object on the equatorial plane and having trajectories exhibiting an anticlockwise and clockwise direction , respectively .",
    "this integral determines the trajectory @xmath47 in the plane where the motion takes place . in the case of a massive particle ( @xmath53 ) the trajectory depends on two integration constants ( @xmath54 and @xmath28 ) . in the case of a scattering problem",
    "these constants can be expressed in terms of an impact parameter and the initial velocity @xmath55 where @xmath4 is the distance of closest approach to the gravitational object attained for some value @xmath56 of the affine parameter . for massless particles ( @xmath57 ) the trajectory depends only on the integration constant @xmath58 that can be interpreted as an impact parameter as follows @xcite @xmath59 this in turn permits to express ( [ 25.21 ] ) as @xmath60^{-1/2}+\\widetilde{c}.\\ ] ] it is useful to derive an inequality which gives us information for the qualitative orbits of the particle .",
    "it is straightforward to see that from ( [ 25.21 ] ) we obtain the condition @xmath61 for massless particles we can write @xmath62 as a first application of equation ( [ vtilde ] ) consider the reissner - nordstrm metric with @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the standard schwarzschild radius and @xmath65 proportional the electric charge .",
    "we have a naked singularity if @xmath66 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath67 has a local minimum and maximum if @xmath68 .",
    "such a minimum in which the photons would be trapped has a physical singificance only if it occurs at a value bigger than the horizon @xmath69 ( the horizons are @xmath70 or in the case of a naked singularity . in figure 1 we demonstrate that this minimum is of relevance only if we have a naked singularity .",
    "hence the range for such meaningful minimum is very narrow , namely @xmath71 if a particle in classical mechanics has a bound orbit ( like in the minimum ) we usually talk about an attractive potential . by the same token using similar nomenclature",
    "we could claim that the existence of photon s bound orbits around a naked singularity is an indication for its attractive nature for light in contrast to some other results for massive particles @xcite .",
    "we will see later that this statement is generic for other naked singularities as well .    [ rn ]   behaviour of the `` photon potential '' proportional to @xmath67 for the reissner - nordstrm naked singularity . as explained in the text in the narrow range of @xmath72 there is a possibility to trap photons inside a well .",

    "let s , l , o , and i denote the light source , the lens , the observer , and the image of the source seen by the observer , respectively . by ol we denote the optical axis .",
    "furthermore , we introduce angles @xmath73 and @xmath74 giving the position of s with respect to ol and the position of i as seen by o , respectively . in general , the closest approach distance @xmath4 does not need to be identified with the impact parameter @xmath75 .",

    "we mean critical images .",

    "light rays experience a bending effect due to the presence of a gravitational field .",
    "we quantify this effect in the case of a lens represented by a schwarzschild black hole with @xmath91 where @xmath92 denotes the mass of the black hole .",
    "we will also suppose that the source , lens , and observer lie along a straight line .",

    "note that the choice of a plus sign in front of the above integral corresponds to the fact that we are considering light rays moving on trajectories having an anticlockwise direction . without loss of generality",
    "we also require that @xmath95 . from @xmath96 to @xmath97 the angle @xmath98 changes by a quantity @xmath99 . along the photon trajectory",
    "the radial vector undergoes a rotation with angle @xmath100 .",
    "if the gravitational object would be absent , we would have a straight line for the photon trajectory implying that @xmath101 .",
    "hence , the angle by which light is bended by a spherically symmetric gravitational field described by an asymptotically flat metric is given by @xcite @xmath102 since in general @xmath103 the underlying three dimensional space is not euclidean .",
    "for very large distances we have @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "this means that asymptotically far away from the gravitational object the light ray can be described as a straight line in the euclidean space .",
    "the distance of closest approach is determined by the condition @xmath106 with @xmath107 and we find that @xmath108 this allows us to eliminate the constant @xmath109 in ( [ 26.1 ] ) so that we can rewrite ( [ 26.2 ] ) as @xmath110^{-1/2}.\\ ] ] depending on the values of the impact parameter we have the following scenarios @xcite    1 .   if @xmath111 , the photon is doomed to be absorbed by the black hole ; 2 .",
    "if @xmath112 , the photon will be deflected and it can reach spatial infinity . here , we must consider two further cases 1 .",
    "if @xmath113 , the orbit is almost a straight line and the deflection angle is approximately given by @xmath114 .",
    "weak gravitational lensing deals with this case which corresponds to the situation when the distance of closest approach is much larger than the radius @xmath115 of the photon sphere . for spherically symmetric and static spacetimes @xmath115 can be computed by solving the equation @xcite @xmath116 in the case of the schwarzschild metric we obtain @xmath117 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath118 , we are in the regime of strong gravitational lensing corresponding to a distance of closest approach @xmath119 . in this case",

    "@xcite splits the integral in ( [ bozza_int ] ) as follows @xmath158 where @xmath159 contains the divergence and @xmath160 is the original integral with the divergence subtracted . at this point one solves the above integrals and the sum of their results will give the deflection angle .",
    "the integral @xmath161 can be solved exactly and we get @xmath162 after having expanded @xmath72 and @xmath73 around the radius of the photon sphere . to compute the residual integral @xmath163 @xcite employs the following expansion @xmath164 and at the first order we find @xmath165 @xcite claims that ( [ regular ] ) can be used to compute all coefficients in the expansion for the regular part of the integral @xmath163 .",
    "this is not true since a closer inspection of the partial derivatives @xmath166 shows that they have the following behaviours as @xmath150 @xmath167 hence , the regular part of the integral giving the deflection angle can not be represented by means of ( [ regular ] ) because otherwise each coefficient with @xmath168 in the expansion for @xmath163 would blow up due to the fact that @xmath166 is never integrable at @xmath151 for all @xmath168 .",
