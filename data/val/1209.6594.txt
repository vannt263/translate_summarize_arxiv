    "ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions create not only a domain of extremely high energy density where a new state of matter  the deconfined quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) may form , but also extremely strong ( electro)magnetic fields due to the relativistic motion of the colliding heavy ions carrying large positive electric charge  @xcite .",
    "previous computations showed that the magnetic fields generated in au + au collision at rhic ( @xmath4 ) can reach about @xmath5 g  @xcite , which is @xmath6 times larger than the strongest man - made steady magnetic field in the laboratory .",
    "the magnetic field generated at lhc energy can be an order of magnitude larger than that at rhic  @xcite , according to a simple scaling law recently found in  @xcite for the event - averaged magnetic field : @xmath7 for @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the charge number of the ions , @xmath10 is the impact parameter , @xmath11 is the radius of nucleus , and the @xmath12-axis is perpendicular to the reaction plane .",
    "thus , heavy - ion collisions provide a unique terrestrial environment with ultra - strong magnetic fields .",
    "there have been very strong interests and intensive efforts recently in studying various possible physical effects induced by the presence of strong magnetic field .",
    "receiving particular enthusiasm is the set of ideas to look for experimental manifestation of qcd effects stemming from topology and anomaly and aided by the external magnetic field .",
    "these include , e.g. , the so - called chiral magnetic effect ( cme )  @xcite in which a nonzero axial charge density in the matter ( presumably from topological transitions via sphalerons ) together with the magnetic field @xmath13 will induce a dipole charge separation along the @xmath13 direction .",
    "a lot of works have been done in the past few years to experimentally measure this effect by analyzing the charged particle correlations  @xcite and to understand the interpretation and background effects related to these measurements  @xcite , as recently reviewed in ref .",
    "there is also the so - called chiral separation effect ( cse )  @xcite , from its interplay with the cme there arises a gapless collective excitation called the chiral magnetic wave ( cmw )  @xcite .",
    "an observable effect of cmw was proposed in  @xcite : the cmw with the presence of nonzero vector charge density and the magnetic field transports the charges in qgp towards an electric quadrupole distribution with more positive charges near the poles of the produced fireball ( pointing outside of the reaction plane ) while more negative charges near the equator ( in the reaction plane ) , and this leads to a measurable splitting of negative and positive pions elliptic flow .",
    "recently star collaboration reported the first measurement of the charged pion flow spitting versus the charge asymmetry which appears in agreement with the predictions from cmw  @xcite .",
    "yet one more interesting effect is possible soft photon production through the qcd conformal anomaly in the external magnetic field as suggested in  @xcite .",
    "( the cme could also possibly cause anisotropic soft photon production , see  @xcite . ) in this mechanism the photons are emitted perpendicular to the @xmath13 direction and there is an appreciable azimuthal anisotropy of the emitted photons which might partially account for the unusually large @xmath14 of direct photons reported by phenix collaboration  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above anomaly phenomena in magnetic field , there are also discussions of other novel effects in strong magnetic fields  @xcite , e.g. , the spontaneous electromagnetic superconductivity of qcd vacuum , the possible enhancement of elliptic flow of charged particles , possible anisotropic electromagnetic radiation from the qgp , the energy loss due to the synchrotron radiation of quarks , and the emergence of anisotropic viscosities .    in most of the phenomenological studies of these effects , the magnetic field @xmath13 in heavy - ion collisions",
    "represents the largest source of uncertainty in their quantitative calculations , and a precise knowledge of the magnetic field is urgently needed .",
    "this is particularly so in the context of the realization and intensive investigations in the last two or three years that there are very strong fluctuations in the initial conditions of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "such fluctuations have been shown to lead to strong observable effects both in the bulk collective expansions ( as `` harmonic flows '' )  @xcite and in the anisotropy of penetrating hard probe ( as `` harmonic tomography '' )  @xcite .",
    "since the magnetic field directly relies on the initial distributions of protons in both nuclei , a realistic computation has to take into account such strong initial fluctuations .",
    "a first step has been made in @xcite to compute the magnitude of @xmath13 with event - by - event fluctuations , which was indeed found to be remarkably modified from the naive `` optical '' estimates .    in this paper , we focus on the strong fluctuations in the azimuthal orientation of the magnetic field @xmath13 , and particularly investigate its angular correlation with the underlying matter geometry ( specified by participant planes ) bearing concurrent fluctuations on an event - by - event basis .",
    "this correlation is a very important link between the experimental measurements and any of the magnetic field induced effects in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "most ( if not all ) previous studies rely on the assumption that the magnetic field is pointing in the out - of - plane direction which would be true without fluctuations . in the real world , however , both the @xmath13 and the `` planes '' ( event planes or participant planes ) bear strong fluctuations and as we will show their orientations are never fully `` locked '' and only strongly correlated in some circumstances .",
    "we will study these correlations in great details and examine the consequences for a number of observables related to some aforementioned effects .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the aim of this section is to give an event - by - event calculation of the electromagnetic fields in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we focus on the fields at the initial time @xmath16 , that is , the moment when the two colliding nuclei overlap completely .",
    "our starting point is the lorentz boosted coulomb formulas which are equivalent to the linard - wiechert potentials for constantly moving charges : @xmath17^{3/2}}{\\bf v}_n\\times{\\bf r}_n,\\nonumber \\\\ \\label{lwe } e{{\\bf e}}(t,{{\\mathbf r}})&=&\\frac{e^2}{4{\\pi}}\\sum_n z_n({\\bf r}_n)\\frac{1-v_n^2}{[r_n^2-({\\bf r}_n\\times{{\\bf v}}_n)^2]^{3/2}}{\\bf r}_n,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the relative position of the field point @xmath19 to the @xmath20th proton at time @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the velocity of the @xmath20th proton .",
    "the summations run over all protons in the projectile and target nuclei .",
    "equations ( [ lwe])contain singularities at @xmath24 if we treat protons as point charges . in practical calculation , to avoid such singularities we treat protons as uniformly charged spheres with radius @xmath25 .",
    "the charge number factor @xmath26 in eqs .",
    "( [ lwe ] ) is introduced to encode this aspect : when the field point locates outside the @xmath20th proton ( in the rest frame of the proton ) @xmath27 , otherwise @xmath28 depends on @xmath29 .",
    "the in - medium charge radius @xmath25 of proton is unknown ( the most recent measurement of the rms charge radius of proton gives @xmath30 fm in vacuum  @xcite ) , we choose @xmath31 fm in our numerical simulations .",
    "we checked that varying @xmath25 from @xmath32 fm to 0.9 fm will shift the numerical results within @xmath33 but no qualitative conclusion is altered .",
    "the nucleons in one nucleus move at constant velocity along the beam direction ( we choose it as @xmath34-direction ) , with the nucleons in another nucleus moving oppositely at the same speed .",
    "the energy for each nucleon is set to be @xmath35 in the center - of - mass frame , therefore the value of the velocity of each nucleon is given by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the mass of the nucleon .",
    "we set the @xmath38-axis along the impact parameter vector so that the reaction plane is the @xmath38-@xmath34 plane .",
    "finally , the positions of nucleons in the rest frame of a nucleus are sampled according to the woods - saxon distribution .     and @xmath39 ( in unit of @xmath40 ) at @xmath16 and four different points on the transverse plane as functions of the impact parameter @xmath10.,title=\"fig:\",width=207 ]   and @xmath39 ( in unit of @xmath40 ) at @xmath16 and four different points on the transverse plane as functions of the impact parameter @xmath10.,title=\"fig:\",width=207 ]                in this computation we have obtained in each event all the components of both the @xmath13 and @xmath41 fields at four different points , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , on the transverse plane for a wide range of impact parameter @xmath10 in au + au collision at rhic energy @xmath44 gev .",
    "we have found that all the @xmath34 components are negligibly small , while the transverse components are strong , with their centrality trends in agreement with previous results in  @xcite .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of these fields are somewhat smaller than those reported in  @xcite , due to the important difference that we treat each proton as a charged sphere with radius @xmath25 rather than a point charge , which is both more physical and mathematically less of singularity problem . as also noted in  @xcite and confirmed in our computation ,",
    "although the @xmath38-component of the magnetic field as well as the @xmath38- and @xmath12-components of the electric field vanish after averaging over many events , their magnitudes in each event can be huge and comparable to the @xmath12-component of the magnetic field due to the fluctuations .",
    "this already implies that both the magnitude and the direction of the electromagnetic field ( albeit in the unmeasurable @xmath38-@xmath12 plane ) fluctuate strongly . in fig .",
    "[ field2 ] we show @xmath45 and @xmath46 as functions of @xmath10 at different points : clearly the electromagnetic fields bear considerable inhomogeneity on the transverse plane .",
    "we also notice that the electric field can be very strong particularly for more central collisions .",
    "the @xmath45 is particularly interesting because the signal strengths of several magnetic - field - induced effects are proportional to @xmath47 , as we will discuss more in sec .",
    "[ impac ] .",
    "as already mentioned before , on the event - by - event basis the electromagnetic field fluctuates strongly both in magnitude and in azimuthal direction .",
    "the direction of the @xmath13-field is very important as the @xmath13-field induced effects inherit this information and occur either along ( e.g. cme , cmw ) or perpendicular ( e.g. photon emission ) to @xmath13 .",
    "even more important from the measurement perspective is the question of the @xmath13 orientation with respect to a frame that could be identified experimentally rather than to the ideal world reaction plane . in reality",
    "what could be determined is the final - state hadrons distribution geometry in momentum space , in particular the second harmonic @xmath14 event plane ( ep ) which is relatively more tightly correlated with the initial matter distribution geometry that can be specified primarily by the second harmonic @xmath48 participant plane ( pp ) .",
    "therefore the really useful information is the @xmath13 orientation with respect to the matter geometry per event .",
    "here we make a first detailed examination of such a kind , studying the azimuthal correlation between the magnetic field and the participant planes .    in order to do that",
    ", we determine the participant planes for various harmonics from the monte carlo glauber simulations of the initial condition and analyze the angular correlations between the @xmath13 and the participant plane orientations from the same event .",
    "the @xmath20th harmonic participant plane angle @xmath49 and eccentricity @xmath50 are calculated from participant density @xmath51 as in the literature ( e.g.  @xcite ) : @xmath52 and @xmath53 for @xmath54 . in this section",
    "we focus on the 2nd harmonic participant plane @xmath55 as it is the most prominent anisotropy from both geometry and fluctuations .",
    "correlations of @xmath13 with other harmonics will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ impac ] . by determining @xmath13 and @xmath55 in each event we can examine the distribution of their relative angle over many events : in fig .",
    "[ his ] we plot the event - by - event histograms of @xmath56 at @xmath57 and @xmath58 fm for au + au collisions at @xmath44 gev where @xmath59 is the azimuthal direction of the magnetic field at @xmath16 and @xmath60 .",
    "strikingly at @xmath61 the histogram of @xmath56 is almost uniform indicating that @xmath59 and @xmath55 are basically uncorrelated . for @xmath62 and @xmath58 fm ,",
    "the histograms have gaussian shapes peaking at @xmath63 with the corresponding widths not small at all .",
    "the width first decreases when @xmath10 increased from @xmath64 to @xmath65 fm and then increases again toward @xmath66 fm .",
    "so although the @xmath13 field indeed points at @xmath67 with respect to @xmath55 plane on average , it fluctuates significantly in each event .",
    "the correlation between @xmath59 and @xmath55 is the strongest in middle - centrality while weakens much in the most central and most peripheral collisions .    to further reveal the correlation pattern between @xmath59 and @xmath55 and to understand better the non - monotonous centrality trend of the widths of the histograms in fig .",
    "[ his ] , we show the scatter plots from all events at given @xmath10 on the @xmath59-@xmath55 plane in fig .",
    "[ scat ] which visualize the 2d probability distribution density .",
    "again for @xmath61 , the events are almost uniformly distributed indicating negligible correlation between @xmath59 and @xmath55 . for @xmath62 , and @xmath58 fm ,",
    "the event distributions evidently concentrate around @xmath68 indicating a correlation between the two .",
    "going from @xmath69 to @xmath65 and to @xmath58 fm , the spread in @xmath59 keeps shrinking while the spread in @xmath55 clear grows with larger @xmath10 .",
    "this is because for non - central collisions with increasing @xmath10 , the @xmath13 is mostly from the spectators whose number increases and bears less fluctuations while the @xmath55 is determined by participants whose number decreases and fluctuates more .",
    "this explains the non - monotonic trend of the widths in the histograms in fig .",
    "[ his ] . in short",
    ", we have found that the event - by - event fluctuations of the initial condition bring azimuthal fluctuations in both @xmath59 and @xmath55 , and the angular correlation between them is smeared out significantly in the very central and very peripheral collisions while stays strong for middle - centrality collisions .",
    "this observation certainly influences the interpretation of observables related with @xmath13-induced effects , as will be discussed in the next section .",
    "we now discuss the impacts of the azimuthal fluctuations of the magnetic field with respect to matter geometry ( the participant planes ) on a number of pertinent observables recently measured in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we recap a few points already discussed : the @xmath13-induced effects are sensitive to the azimuthal direction of the @xmath13 field , which however is not experimentally known ; in the past when observables are proposed and interpreted for measuring certain @xmath70-related effects , it is often assumed that the @xmath70 direction is perpendicular to the reaction plane ; as already shown in last section , this assumption is not true , and the azimuthal orientation between @xmath71 of @xmath70 and @xmath72 fluctuates with sizable spread in their relative angle @xmath73 . in what follows we evaluate the impacts of such fluctuations on the experimentally measured quantities .    first ,",
    "let us consider the pair correlation @xmath74 with @xmath75 the azimuthal angles of the particle 1 and 2 where the average is taken over events .",
    "the measurements of @xmath76 are motivated by the search for the chiral magnetic effect  @xcite .",
    "( the @xmath76 is actually extracted through three particle correlations @xmath77 divided by elliptic flow @xmath14 with the third particle serving as a `` projector '' toward the event plane  @xcite . )",
    "now let us focus on the same - charge pairs , and suppose the cme indeed gives rise to the same - side azimuthal correlations along the @xmath70-field direction for the same - charge pairs .",
    "the two - particle density then receives the following contribution ( with @xmath78 the signal strength ) @xmath79 this translates into the following form after re - defining angles @xmath80 and @xmath81 : @xmath82\\ , \\cos(\\bar{\\phi}_1+\\bar{\\phi}_2 )   \\nonumber \\\\ & & +   \\frac{a_{++}}{2 } [ \\sin(2\\bar{\\psi}_{\\bf b})]\\ , \\sin(\\bar{\\phi}_1+\\bar{\\phi}_2).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we therefore see that the cme s contribution to the @xmath83 : @xmath84 if the @xmath70-direction were to be always perfectly aligned with the out - of - plane , i.e. @xmath85 , then we simply have @xmath86 .",
    "but the fluctuations in magnetic field as well as in matter geometry will blur the angular relation between the two and modify the signal by the factor @xmath87 .",
    "similarly , if one measures the charge separation with respect to higher harmonic participant plane , e.g. the fourth harmonic plane @xmath88 , the corresponding correlation will be @xmath89{\\rangle}$ ] ( as recently proposed with the hope to disentangle the collective - flow and cme contributions to @xmath76  @xcite ) .",
    "the azimuthal fluctuation of @xmath13 field with respect to @xmath88 will again contribute a modification factor @xmath90{\\rangle}$ ] in the above correlation .",
    "-weighted correlations @xmath91{\\rangle}/{\\langle}(e{{\\bf b}})^2{\\rangle}$ ] as functions of impact parameter for @xmath92 at @xmath60 fm .",
    ", width=207 ]    recently it has been suggested that a splitting between the elliptic flow of the @xmath93 and @xmath94 could occur in heavy - ion collisions due to the chiral magnetic wave  @xcite , as briefly discussed in sec .",
    "[ intro ] .",
    "specifically the cmw will induce an electric quadruple in the net charge distribution along the @xmath70 field : @xmath95 =   2r_e \\cos[2(\\bar{\\phi } - \\bar{\\psi}_{\\bf b})],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath96 $ ] quantifies the quadruple from cmw .",
    "this modifies the final charged hadron distribution by an amount proportional to @xmath97 : @xmath98\\rc , \\quad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is the charge multiplicity .",
    "thus one obtains a splitting of the charged pions @xmath14 @xmath100 again , we see the modification factor @xmath101 arising from relative orientation between @xmath70 and @xmath55 . if @xmath102 were to be simply @xmath67 ( i.e. @xmath70 always out - of - plane ) then the sign of splitting is always @xmath103 . however due to the fluctuation , @xmath102 deviates from @xmath67 and leads to a smaller splitting .",
    "finally , we consider the example of recently suggested soft photon production from conformal anomaly in the presence of an external @xmath13 field  @xcite .",
    "the photon emitted via this mechanism carries azimuthal information of the external magnetic field .",
    "if one assumes a homogeneous external @xmath70 field , then the produced photon spectrum goes like @xmath104 leading to the following azimuthal distribution : @xmath105 \\rc={\\left\\ { } \\newcommand\\rc{\\right\\}}1 - \\cos[2(\\bar{\\phi}-\\bar{\\psi}_b)]\\rc \\quad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which will contribute the following to the elliptic flow of these photons ( with @xmath106 being the signal strength ) @xmath107 once again we see the same modification factor @xmath87 due to the mismatch between @xmath70 field and the out - of - plane direction from event to event .",
    "if @xmath102 were to be simply @xmath67 ( i.e. @xmath70 always out - of - plane ) then indeed these photons will have positive and sizable elliptic flow .",
    "however the fluctuation may bring @xmath102 to depart from @xmath67 considerably .",
    "in all three examples , the fluctuating @xmath56 brings in a reduction to the intrinsic strength of the signal by @xmath108 it is therefore worth a close examination of this factor : see fig .",
    "[ icos2 ] for the computed average values of @xmath109{\\rangle}$ ] for varied centralities from event - by - event determination of the @xmath70-field direction @xmath71 ( at several different spatial points ) and the participants harmonics , @xmath110 , @xmath92 .",
    "the plots suggest that the correlations between @xmath59 and the odd harmonics @xmath111 are practically zero ( in accord with parity invariance ) , while the the correlations of @xmath59 with even harmonics @xmath112 are nonzero but get suppressed as compared with the results in optical geometry limit ( without fluctuations ) e.g. @xmath113{\\rangle}_{\\rm opt}=-1 $ ] .",
    "the centrality dependence of @xmath113{\\rangle}$ ] is in perfect agreement with the patterns seen in the histograms fig .",
    "[ his ] and scatter plots fig .",
    "[ scat ] : it is significantly suppressed in the most central and most peripheral cases ( indicating no correlations ) while is maximized around @xmath114 fm with peak values @xmath115 .",
    "similar behavior is observed for @xmath116{\\rangle}$ ] too albeit with a weaker correlation strengths , e.g. with the peak values @xmath117 or so .",
    "although suppressed , the correlation between @xmath59 and @xmath88 appears still sizable for moderate values of @xmath10 . this may imply complications and caveats that must be seriously addressed for the proposal in ref .",
    "@xcite to use the two - particle correlation with respect to the fourth harmonic event plane to disentangle the cme contribution and the flow contribution .",
    "the plots in  fig.[icos2 ] for four different field points demonstrate the spatial dependence of the correlations @xmath109{\\rangle}$ ] on the transverse plane .",
    "we first see minor differences when the field point deviates from the origin and such differences become sizable for the outer most point @xmath118 fm .",
    "the comparison suggests that further away from the origin the correlations between @xmath59 and @xmath49 become even weaker .",
    "however , near the central overlapping region , the correlations are almost homogeneous over , for example , the distance of the typical size of a sphaleron , @xmath119 fm for rhic and lhc  @xcite .",
    "the last issue we want to address is the possible correlation between the @xmath13 orientation and its own strength .",
    "it is conceivable that there could be correlation ( on an event - by - event basis ) between the signal strength and the @xmath70 field direction .",
    "typically the signal strength of these @xmath70-field induced effects will scale as @xmath120 .",
    "for example , recalling that the cme current is proportional to @xmath13 and the signal strength @xmath78 as mentioned earlier would be nearly proportional to @xmath121 .",
    "the quadrupole strength @xmath97 through cmw also scales similarly @xmath122 .",
    "so does the signal strength @xmath123 in the case of soft photon emissions .",
    "if the field strength and the orientation of @xmath13 do correlate with each other , then one may not be able to factorize the signal strength and the field orientation factor @xmath124 when taking the event average .",
    "we therefore further examine the correlations between the two by evaluating the factor @xmath125 in fig .",
    "[ figb2 ] we show the impact parameter dependence of the @xmath126-weighted correlations @xmath91{\\rangle}/{\\langle}(e{{\\bf b}})^2{\\rangle}$ ] for @xmath92 .",
    "we find little difference between the two factors @xmath127 in fig.[icos2](the most left panel ) and @xmath128 in fig.[figb2 ] at all centralities for all @xmath20 values .",
    "while only results for field point @xmath60 are shown in fig.[figb2 ] , we have checked all other three points and the observation is the same .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the magnitude of the magnetic field has no noticeable correlation to its azimuthal direction with respect to the matter geometry .",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss how the event - by - event fluctuation affects the correlation between the orientation of @xmath41-field and the participants harmonic planes , @xmath49 .",
    "the motivation is that from fig .",
    "[ field2 ] we notice that the electric field can be as strong as the magnetic one , and thus they may lead to observable effects too .",
    "an obvious example is possible multiple charge distributions induced by the strong electric field .",
    "similarly to the magnetic field case , possible @xmath41-induced effects would be affected by the azimuthal correlations between @xmath41 and matter geometry .",
    "it is therefore interesting to also study these correlations . in fig .",
    "[ fige1 ] , we show the correlations @xmath129{\\rangle}$ ] , @xmath92 , as functions of the impact parameter at the four field points as before .",
    "there are a number of interesting features that differ from the magnetic field case : 1 ) there is a clear negative correlation ( i.e. back - to - back ) between @xmath130 and @xmath131 and it is most strong in the more central collisions and at the field point near the origin  this is understandable as the pole of @xmath131 with more matter will concurrently have more positive charges from protons generating @xmath41 pointing in the opposite ; 2 ) at field points away from the origin the @xmath130 is strongly correlated to @xmath55 ( and also weakly correlated to @xmath88 )  the direction of @xmath41 is more in - plane for the field point on @xmath38-axis while more out - of - plane for points away from @xmath38-axis ; 3 ) there is also a weak correlation between @xmath130 and @xmath132 .",
    "finally we have also checked the @xmath39-weighted correlations @xmath133{\\rangle}/{\\langle}(e{{\\bf e}})^2{\\rangle}$ ] and find no visible correlation between the @xmath41 magnitude and orientation .",
    "the studies of correlations between @xmath13 and @xmath41 fields and matter geometry suggest in general that there may be nontrivial charge distributions , particularly in azimuthal angles ( e.g. charged dipole and quadrupole ) , induced by varied @xmath13- and @xmath134induced effects .",
    "there are also other effects not related the initial @xmath41 and @xmath13 fields , e.g. , the local charge conservation effect  @xcite that can lead to nontrivial charge azimuthal correlations when coupled with various harmonic flows .",
    "it is therefore tempting to think about possible measurements that may fully extract information for the azimuthal charge distributions . in parallel to the measurements of ( charge - inclusive ) global azimuthal particle distributions",
    "that can be subsequently fourier - decomposed into various harmonic components , here we suggest a class of observables , the charged multiple vectors @xmath135 .",
    "consider the measured charged hadrons in an event we can construct the charged multiple vector @xmath136 with magnitude @xmath137 and azimuthal angle @xmath138 : @xmath139 where the summation runs over all particles with @xmath140 and @xmath141 the electric charge and azimuthal angle of the @xmath142-th particle .",
    "this idea generalizes the earlier proposal of the charged dipole vector analysis suggested in @xcite in the context of cme observables .",
    "one may introduce properly @xmath143-weighed definition .",
    "one may also think of sub - event version of this analysis or possible multi - particle correlation improved version .",
    "we emphasize that these are different and independent from the existing @xmath144 vectors related to flow measurements , i.e. @xmath145 . the @xmath144 is charge blind and includes all charges similarly while the @xmath136 takes the difference between positive and negative charges therefore yields information on the charge distribution .",
    "the technical difficulty of @xmath136 measurements should be at the same level as previous @xmath144 analysis and quite feasible , while clearly the @xmath136 analysis provides orthogonal and unique information on the charge distributions . with a joint @xmath144 and @xmath136 analysis one can study the strength and azimuthal correlations among all harmonics and charged multipoles .",
    "therefore it is very valuable to do a systematic charged multiple vector analysis , leading toward a quantitative `` charge landscape survey '' in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "in summary , we have performed a detailed study of the event - by - event fluctuations of both the azimuthal orientation of the magnetic and electric fields as well as the matter geometry ( which is specified by the participant planes of a series of harmonics ) in the initial condition of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "such fluctuations suppress the azimuthal correlations between the magnetic field and the second harmonic participant plane particularly in the very central and very peripheral collisions , while leaving a window around @xmath114 fm with still sizable correlation between the two .",
    "we have further studied similar azimuthal correlations between @xmath13 and other harmonic participant planes , and found similar yet weaker correlation with @xmath88 while no correlation with @xmath146 and @xmath132 .",
    "the correlation between @xmath59 and @xmath88 may indicate that the cme can also contribute to the charge - pair correlation @xmath89{\\rangle}$ ] as opposed to the assumption in ref .",
    "examination of these correlations at different field points shows notable dependence on spatial positions . for completeness",
    "we have presented similar studies for electric field @xmath41 azimuthal correlations with matter geometry which show quite different patterns from that for the @xmath13 field .",
    "we have evaluated the impact of such azimuthal fluctuations and correlations on a number of observables related to magnetic - field induced effects in heavy - ion collisions : the charged pair azimuthal correlations , the charge dependent elliptic flow of pions , as well as the azimuthal anisotropy of soft photons due to conformal anomaly .",
    "specifically we have quantified the modification factors @xmath147 and the @xmath126-weighted reduction factor @xmath148 at different centralities ( see figs .  [ icos2 ] and [ figb2 ] ) and found sizable reduction in both very central and very peripheral collisions . from these results",
    "we conclude that the optimal centrality class for observing the above mentioned @xmath13-induced effects corresponds to impact parameter range @xmath3 fm .",
    "the qualitative conclusion should hold also for pb + pb collisions at lhc .",
    "we end with a few pertinent remarks : + ( 1 ) in our computations ( as well as all the previous computations  @xcite ) , the classical linard - wiechert potentials have been used .",
    "one may worry about quantum corrections to the field equations as the magnitude of the electromagnetic field is much larger than the electron and light quark masses . in principle",
    "a calculation including all relevant qed processes is needed , but a one - loop euler - heisenberg effective lagrangian ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for review ) may give a good indication on the size of such corrections . at strong - field limit the field equation derived from this lagrangian can be regarded as linear maxwell equations with the renormalized charge @xmath149}$ ] .",
    "an estimate implies that the computed electromagnetic field may be amended only by a few percent even for @xmath150 .",
    "+ ( 2 ) as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the magnetic field magnitude bears strong time dependence .",
    "furthermore , the electromagnetic response of qgp could dramatically modify the time evolution of the @xmath13 and @xmath41 fields .",
    "it would be important to incorporate these into realistic modeling of effects induced by these fields , as recently attempted in  @xcite to incorporate the time evolution into the event - by - event estimates of the cme by using the parton - hadron - string - dynamics approach .",
    "+ ( 3 ) as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to disentangle the effects of the magnetic field and the collective flow , it is very useful to study the u + u collisions where the geometry becomes a nontrivial level arm",
    ". it will be interesting to study in the future the various correlations among the field strengths , field azimuthal orientations with the matter geometric eccentricities as well as the harmonic participant planes .",
