    "as energy consumption is becoming an environmental and therefore social and economic issue , green information and communication technology ( ict ) has attracted significant research attention recently .",
    "it was reported that internet consumes as much as @xmath0 of the total electricity in broadband enabled countries@xcite , and currently and in the medium term future , the majority of the energy of internet is consumed by access networks owing to the large quantity of access nodes @xcite .",
    "energy consumptions of access networks depend on the access technologies . among various access technologies including",
    "wimax , fttn , and point to point optical access networks , passive optical networks ( pons ) consume the smallest energy per transmission bit attributed to the proximity of optical fibers to the end users and the passive nature of the remote node @xcite .",
    "however , as pon is deployed worldwide , it still consumes a significant amount of energy .",
    "it is desirable to reduce the energy consumption of pons since every single watt saving will end up with overall terawatt and even larger power saving .",
    "reducing energy consumption of pons becomes even more important as the current pon systems evolve into next - generation pons with increased data rate provisioning @xcite .    in pons ,",
    "energy is consumed by optical line terminal ( olt ) and optical network units ( onus ) .",
    "owing the large quantity , onus consume a large portion of the overall pon energy @xcite .",
    "although olt consumes a less amount of power than the total aggregated onus , one olt line card does consume a much larger amount of power than one onu .",
    "reducing energy consumption of olt is as important as reducing energy consumption of onus especially from the operators and home users perspectives .",
    "for the network operators , decreasing the energy consumption of olt can significantly reduce the energy consumption of the central office , while decreasing the energy consumption of onus has small and likely negligible impacts on that of home users who have many other electrical appliances with much higher energy consumption .",
    "formerly , sleep mode and adaptive line rate have been proposed to efficiently reduce the power consumption of onus by taking advantages of the bursty nature of the traffic at the user side @xcite .",
    "it is , however , challenging to introduce `` sleep '' mode into olt to reduce its energy consumption for the following reasons . in pons",
    ", olt serves as the central access node which controls the network resource access of onus .",
    "putting olt into sleep can easily result in service disruption of onus in communicating with the olt .",
    "thus , a proper scheme is needed to reduce the energy consumption of olt without degrading services of end users .    in this paper , we propose a novel energy - efficient olt structure which can adapt its power - on olt line cards according to the real - time arrival traffic . to avoid service degradation during the process of powering on / off olt line cards ,",
    "proper devices are added into the legacy olt chassis to facilitate all onus communicate with power - on line cards . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first work focusing on reducing the energy consumption of olt .",
    "in the central office , one olt chassis typically comprises of multiple olt line cards that transmit downstream signals and receive upstream signals at different wavelengths .",
    "each line card communicates with a number of onus .",
    "two wavelengths for the uplink and the downlink are assigned to each onu . in the currently deployed epon and gpon systems",
    ", one olt line card usually communicates with either @xmath1 or @xmath2 onus and such an arrangement is referred to as a pon segment . to avoid service disruptions of onus connected to the central office , all these olt line cards in the olt chassis are usually power - on all the time . to reduce the energy consumption of olt ,",
    "our main idea is to adapt the number of power - on olt line cards in the olt chassis to the real - time incoming traffic .",
    "there are two types of subscribers that each network serves ; business subscribers and residential subscribers .",
    "business and residential areas are usually disjunct .",
    "it is more likely that each pon segment serves either business customers or residential customers .",
    "these two types of customers have different traffic profiles .",
    "business users demand high bandwidth during the day and low bandwidth at night while residential customers request high bandwidth in the evening and low bandwidth during the day .    during the day time",
    ", residential segments are lightly loaded .",
    "therefore , one olt line card can serve several residential segments . in the similar way",
    ", the traffic from the business segments can combined to traverse a smaller number of line cards in the evening .",
    "business and residential segments usually have low bandwidth demands during the midnight . in these situations ,",
    "the whole network is lightly loaded . in order to save energy ,",
    "the number of line cards can be reduced based on the traffic volume .",
    "parameters of the proposed model are notated below :    @xmath3 : data rate of one olt line card in the upstream direction .",
    "@xmath4 : data rate of one olt line card in the downstream direction .",
    "@xmath5 : total number of line cards ( pon segments ) .",
    "@xmath6 : number of onus connected to pon segment @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 : fixed traffic cycle in tdm pon .",
    "@xmath9 : arrival upstream traffic rate from onu @xmath10 of pon segment @xmath7 at time @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 : arrival downstream traffic rate to onu @xmath10 of pon segment @xmath7 at time @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath13 : smallest number of required olt line cards at time @xmath11 . by powering on all the olt line cards , the overall upstream data rate and downstream data rate accommodated by the olt chassis equal to @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "@xmath14 ( or @xmath15 ) may be greater than the real - time upstream ( or downstream ) traffic",
    ".    the traffic rate of each segment can not be more than the provisioned capacity of the dedicated fiber .",
    "therefore , the following constraints have to be satisfied for any segment @xmath7 : @xmath16 @xmath17 the real time incoming upstream and downstream traffics are defined as @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively . then , @xmath20    our ultimate objective is to * power on only @xmath13 olt line cards to serve all @xmath21 onus * at a given time @xmath11 instead of powering on all @xmath5 line cards .",
    "however , powering off olt line cards may result in service disruptions of onus communicating with these olt line cards . to avoid service disruption , power - on olt line cards should be able to provision bandwidth to all onus connected to the olt chassis . to address this issue",
    ", we propose several modifications over the legacy olt chassis to realize the dynamic configuration of olt as will be presented next .",
    "to dynamically configure the communications between olt line cards and onus , one scheme we propose is to place an optical switch in front of all olt line cards as shown in fig.[fig : engolt ] ( a ) .",
    "the function of the optical switch is to dynamically configure the connections between olt line cards and onus . when the network is heavily loaded , the switches can be configured such that each pon system communicates with one olt line card .    as discussed in section [ sec : i ] , when the network is lightly loaded , the switches can be configured such that multiple pon systems communicate with one line card .",
    "then , some olt line cards can be powered off , thus reducing energy consumption .",
    "assume the energy consumption of the optical switch is negligible .",
    "as compared to the scheme of always powering on all @xmath5 line cards , the scheme of powering on only @xmath13 line cards at time @xmath11 can achieve relative energy saving as large as@xmath22    then , the average energy saving over time span @xmath8 equals to @xmath23    we define the traffic load as the maximum of upstream and downstream traffic loads to determine the required number of line cards : @xmath24the process of changing the switch configuration is time consuming , frequent change of each line card s status may degrade the onu performance .",
    "since the traffic of the onus is also bursty and changes dynamically , it is more efficient to monitor the traffic for an observation period ( @xmath25 ) before changing the switch configuration .",
    "if the traffic load of the network remains below a threshold for @xmath25 , the number of line cards will be adjusted accordingly . by",
    "dynamically configuring switches , the number of power - on olt line cards is reduced from @xmath5 to @xmath26 when the traffic load falls between @xmath27 and @xmath28 for a period of @xmath25 .",
    "thus , a significant amount of power can be potentially saved .",
    "[ fig : engolt ] ( b)-(e ) illustrates the configuration of switches for the case that one olt chassis contains four olt line cards .",
    "the number of power - on olt line cards is reduced from four to three , two , and one when the traffic load falls within the range @xmath29 $ ] , @xmath30 $ ] , and @xmath31 $ ] , respectively .    by equipping the olt chassis with proper optical switches ,",
    "the communications between olt line cards and onus can be dynamically configured .",
    "the new olt structure appears to be promising and cost - effective as compared to the wdm based solutions .",
    "configuration time of the optical switches and power consumption of each switch are two main specifications that should be considered in the analysis .",
    "switches take time to change configurations",
    ". the switch reconfiguration time may affect the onu performances when powering on / off olt line cards .",
    "we investigate the impacts of the switch reconfiguration time on epon and gpon , respectively .",
    "* epon : we argue that services of epon onus are not affected when the switch configuration time is as large as @xmath32 ms .",
    "+ in epon , the upstream bandwidth allocation is controlled by olt .",
    "onus transmit the upstream traffic using the allocated time durations stated in the gate message .",
    "ieee 802.3ah @xcite specifies that onus need to send gate messages every @xmath32 ms to maintain registration even if they do not have traffic to transmit .",
    "thus , the disrupted servicing time can be transparent to epon onus when the switch reconfiguration time is as large as @xmath32 ms , which can be satisfied by most optical switches .",
    "* gpon : we argue that services of gpon onus are not affected when the switching time is no greater than @xmath33 .",
    "+ for gpon , itu - t g. 984.3 @xcite specifies a fixed frame length of 125 @xmath34 .",
    "an onu receives downstream control messages and sends its upstream data or control traffic every gpon frame , i.e. , 125 @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , services of gpon onus are not affected when the switch configuration time is no greater than @xmath33 .",
    "so far , we have not considered the impact of the power consumption of optical switches on the saved energy of olt chassis .",
    "optical switches consume some power , and the nonzero power consumption of optical switches may reduce the saved energy of the olt chassis .",
    "denote @xmath35 and @xmath36 as the power consumption of optical switch and one olt line card , respectively . by incorporating considering the energy consumption of the optical switch ,",
    "the power consumption of the proposed olt chassis at any given time @xmath11 equals to @xmath37 hence , the energy saving is reduced to @xmath38 the proposed olt chassis can save some energy as compared to the legacy olt chassis when the power consumption @xmath35 of the optical switch satisfy the following condition @xmath39 the power consumption of optical switch differs from the switch size as well as the manufacturing technology . it is reported that one @xmath40 optomechanic switch consumes around @xmath41 w @xcite , while an olt line card consumes around @xmath42 w @xcite . then , for the @xmath43 case , energy can be saved as long as the average number of power - on olt line cards @xmath44 is less than @xmath45 .",
    "this condition can be easily satisfied .",
    "therefore , even considering the power consumption of optical switches , the proposed olt structure can still achieve a significant amount of power saving as compared to the legacy olt .",
    "we employ semi - markov chains to analyze the system .",
    "different observation periods have been considered for decreasing and increasing the number of line cards .",
    "@xmath46 is the observation time period for decreasing the number of active line cards .",
    "@xmath47 is defined as an observation period for increasing the number of line cards . in order to ease the analysis , from now on ,",
    "the formulations are based on the downstream traffic only .",
    "poisson processes with the average rate of @xmath48 packets per second is assumed for downlink packet arrivals .",
    "a fixed traffic scheduling cycle is assumed in the performance analysis .",
    "consider @xmath49 as the probability that @xmath50 downstream packets arrive at the olt chassis during @xmath8 traffic scheduling cycle : @xmath51 the same process can be considered for uplink packet arrival in the case of having downstream and upstream traffic simultaneously",
    ".      in the defined markov chain model , the total number of active line cards vary from @xmath52 to @xmath5 .",

    "that the typical switching speed of the opto - mechanical switch is around @xmath42 ms . as discussed before , it does not affect the performances of users in epon , but may have impacts on the performances of users in gpon .",
    "another scheme of avoiding the significant cost increase is to use electrical switches instead . however , before aggregating traffic using electrical switches , the optical transceivers are required to convert the optical signals into electrical signals .",

    "as it can be seen in figure [ fig : loadsim ] , the trend of energy saving performance by increasing the traffic load for self - similar traffic is similar to that of the markov model for poisson traffic .",
    "figure [ fig : dlistensim ] shows the impact of different @xmath60 listen cycles on the system performance . similar to the theoretical analysis of poisson traffic , energy saving decreases as the number of listen cycles increases .",

    "<S> to be environmentally friendly , it is desirable to reduce energy consumption of olt as much as possible ; such requirement becomes even more urgent as olt keeps increasing its provisioning data rate , and higher data rate provisioning usually implies higher energy consumption . in this paper , we propose a novel energy - efficient olt structure which guarantees services of end users with the smallest number of power - on olt line cards . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , we adapt the number of power - on olt line cards to the real - time incoming traffic . </S>",
    "<S> also , in order to avoid service disruption resulted by powering off olt line cards , proper optical switches are equipped in olt to dynamically configure the communications between olt line cards and onus .
