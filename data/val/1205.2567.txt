    "precise rotation sensors are critical components for stabilization , navigation , and targeting applications . at the moment , the most sensitive commercial devices are optical gyroscopes based on the sagnac effect  @xcite .",
    "such a device consists of a ring interferometer with two counter - propagating light waves , as shown in fig .",
    "[ optgyro.fig ] .",
    "the rotation of such an interferometer results in a phase difference between the two optical fields proportional to the magnitude of the rotational angular velocity @xmath1 : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the light angular frequency , @xmath4 is the speed of light , and @xmath5 is the area of the optical loop .",
    "most successful realizations to date are fiber - optics gyroscopes , in which the interferometer ring is formed by a loop of an optical fiber .",
    "the sensitivity of such an interferometer is usually boosted by using a large number @xmath0 of loops that increase the effective area in eq .   by a factor of @xmath0 .",
    "the sagnac phase shift can then be measured directly from the interference of the two counter - propagating waves at the output , or by monitoring the resulting frequency difference between corresponding counter - propagating modes of the interferometer cavity . in either case",
    ", the reciprocity of light propagation dramatically reduces effects of environmental factors ( temperature , vibrations , etc . ) , and ensures high reliability . as a result , the sensitivity of state - of - the - art compact fiber - optic gyroscopes has reached the shot - noise - limited value of @xmath6@xmath7  @xcite , while large - area laser gyroscopes have achieved even greater sensitivities , on the order of @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "similar sensitivity has been also achieved with matter - based sagnac interferometers . in this case , the rotation - induced phase equation may be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent the average velocity and the de broglie wavelength of the massive particles , respectively . here ,",
    "the advantage gained by the use of massive particles ( @xmath12 ) is offset by the much smaller effective area compared to fiber - optics devices , resulting in similar performance  @xcite .",
    "recent demonstrations of slow light pulse propagation in coherent optical media stirred active debate on the possibility of using slow - light pulses to enhance the sagnac effect .",
    "it was quickly established that neither large positive ( `` slow light '' ) nor negative ( `` fast light '' ) dispersion has a _ direct _ influence on the magnitude of the sagnac phase shift in eq .",
    "( [ sagnac ] )  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it still seems to be possible to take advantage of a large group index to enhance gyroscopic performance .",
    "for example , the output signal of a rotating interferometer with a highly dispersive slow - light medium can be enhanced by its differential response to opposite sagnac phase shifts of two counter - propagating light waves  @xcite .",
    "a modest factor - of-@xmath13 enhancement of the observed phase difference has been recently demonstrated in a slow light fiber ring  @xcite , and a more significant enhancement ( up to a factor of 200 ) is predicted in certain coupled resonator structures  @xcite .",
    "even more dramatic improvements are predicted for the measurement of the sagnac - effect - induced mode splitting in an active ring cavity with strong negative dispersion  @xcite .",
    "calculations have shown that the resulting frequency difference between two counter - propagating modes is inversely proportional to the group index , and thus nominally diverges for @xmath14 ( i.e. , for @xmath15 )  @xcite .",
    "while this divergence disappears after correcting for higher - order nonlinear effects , a @xmath16 improvement in gyroscope sensitivity should still be possible .",
    "the current status of these debates shows that while strong positive or negative optical dispersion may indeed be capable of dramatic improvements in optical gyroscope performance , there is no clear winning approach .",
    "thus , an atomic system that can be easily reconfigured to exhibit either strong positive or strong negative dispersion is an ideal candidate for the development of such a new generation of advanced optical gyroscopes . in the last decade , controllable manipulations of the group velocity of light have been demonstrated in a wide range of systems  @xcite . nonetheless , atomic systems with long - lived spin coherences still provide the highest values of group index for both slow and fast light regimes  @xcite . in such atomic systems ,",
    "the group velocity for a probe optical field can be widely tuned by adjusting parameters of a strong control field that provides strong coupling of the probe optical field to a collective atomic spin state  @xcite .",
    "an ideal test system for the development of a new type of optical gyroscope with improved rotational sensitivity should have a dispersion that can be continuously controlled in the widest possible range  from the highest positive group index to the highest negative group index  with minimal changes in the experimental arrangement .",
    "while several interaction schemes are capable of such wide tunability  @xcite , a so - called _ n_-scheme has recently emerged as a promising candidate  @xcite . a possible realization of an _ n_-scheme is formed by three optical fields interacting with four - level atoms in the arrangement shown in fig .  [ nlevels.fig ] .",
    "in the absence of the control field , the two resonant optical fields @xmath17 form a regular @xmath18 system exhibiting eit and slow light  @xcite .",
    "the interaction of the atoms with the second strong control field @xmath19 splits this single eit peak into two , separated by a narrow enhanced - absorption peak .",
    "this spectral region exhibits a fast - light effect , desired for gyroscope performance enhancement .",
    "however , this fast - light regime can not be directly utilized in the proposed active enhanced - sensitivity optical gyroscope due to its unavoidable high optical losses .    in this manuscript",
    ", we provide an extended treatment of the four - level _ n_-scheme that includes the possibility of four - wave mixing ( fwm ) by allowing optical transitions ( and spontaneous decay ) between states @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the associated fwm gain modifies the transmission of the probe field  @xcite , and provides a smooth switch between slow- and fast - light regimes by varying the strength of one of the pump fields ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the evolution of a four - level _ n_-system , shown in fig .",
    "[ nlevels.fig ] , can be described under the rotating - wave approximation by the following hamiltonian : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the rabi frequencies and phases of the corresponding optical fields , respectively , and @xmath25 are their detunings from the corresponding optical transitions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ nlevels.fig ] .",
    "here we have assumed the four - photon resonance condition @xmath26 , as well as the phase - matching condition on the optical wavenumbers @xmath27 , @xmath28 , which results in the elimination of the explicit time and space dependence from the hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "the four - photon resonance condition is automatically satisfied in the situation that we will primarily consider , in which the stokes field @xmath29 is spontaneously generated .",
    "mhz is on ( standard eit regime ) ; _ ( b ) _ both control fields @xmath30  mhz and @xmath31  mhz are present , but no radiative transition between states @xmath20 and @xmath21 is allowed ( standard _ n_-scheme ) ; _ ( c ) _ both control fields @xmath32  mhz and @xmath33  mhz are present , and both excited states have equal decay rates into each of the ground states . for all graphs the excited state decay rates are @xmath34  mhz , the ground - state relaxation rate is @xmath35  mhz , we assume equal branching ratios for all optical transitions , and both pump fields are resonant with corresponding optical transitions . ]",
    "the ability to control the dispersion of the probe field @xmath36 by adjusting the intensities of two strong control fields @xmath37 and @xmath19 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ nscheme_comp.fig ] , obtained by numerically solving the evolution equations obtained from the above hamiltonian for the steady - state condition .",
    "figure  [ nscheme_comp.fig](a ) shows a traditional eit regime , with a moderately strong first control field @xmath38  mhz and the second control field @xmath19 turned off .",
    "as expected , we observe a dip in the absorption spectrum ( dashed line ) and steep , positive , linear dispersion of the refractive index ( solid line ) near zero two - photon detuning @xmath39 , between two absorption peaks corresponding to the autler - townes splitting of the excited state by the strong control field .",
    "figure  [ nscheme_comp.fig](b ) depicts the situation in which the atoms interact with both strong control fields @xmath37 and @xmath19 in a standard _ n_-configuration , in which optical transition from state @xmath20 to @xmath21 is not allowed by selection rules . in this case , the spectrum consists of four partially - resolved absorption resonances , which can be interpreted as unequal autler - townes splittings of the states @xmath40 and @xmath41 by the control fields of different intensities @xmath42  mhz and @xmath43  mhz . even though there are several spectral regions in which steep anomalous dispersion is realized , all of them occur in conjunction with enhanced absorption .",
    "finally , figure  [ nscheme_comp.fig](c ) shows that the situation is quite different if optical transitions are allowed from both excited states to each of the ground states . in this case , the four - wave mixing process in a double-@xmath18 system is possible , and it is enhanced through the long - lived spin coherence between states @xmath21 and @xmath40  @xcite . as a result",
    ", a new optical stokes field @xmath29 is efficiently generated , and the probe - field spectrum consists of two antisymmetric raman resonances , with gain regions at both positive and negative probe - field detunings .",
    "for properly chosen intensities of the two control fields , it is possible to adjust the frequency splitting and widths of these peaks to achieve a negatively - sloped refractive index for the probe field near the zero two - photon detuning @xmath44 , while the its gain drops to zero between the two gain peaks .",
    "thus , the probe field experiences minimal absorption or gain for frequencies near the two - photon resonance , which are the desired characteristics of an atomic medium for gyroscope enhancement .     on the two - photon resonance , as function of both control fields strengths .",
    "for this calculation , we assumed @xmath45  cm - long atomic medium of @xmath46  cm rb density ; the rest of the experimental parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ nscheme_comp.fig ] .",
    "zero probe - field absorption is predicted for the shown range of control fields rabi frequencies . ]    from this picture , it is clear that optimization of the control field intensities allows for smooth tuning of the probe field s dispersion from slow to fast light regimes by changing the frequency shift and shape of the raman peaks . to find the optimal operational parameters numerically ,",
    "we compute the spectrum of the probe field @xmath36 for the range of the control fields rabi frequencies and calculate dispersion at the zero two - photon resonance .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ dispersionmap.fig ] .",
    "one can see that depending on the ratio between two control fields , the probe experiences either slow light ( when the two gain peaks for positive and negative two - photon detuning are not resolved and form a single gain peak ) , or fast light ( when the two peak are farther apart , forming a distinct dip between them ) .",
    "when both fields are very strong , the raman resonances are shifted too far from the origin , leading to flat dispersion . from this analysis",
    "we have identified @xmath47  mhz and @xmath43  mhz as suitable values for producing the desired lossless fast - light behavior .    under the four - wave mixing condition , the spontaneously generated stokes field",
    "@xmath29 experiences strong gain , and thus its intensity increases as it propagates through the medium .",
    "moreover , its presence has a strong effect on the probe field amplitude due to their mutual coupling through the atomic spin coherence , even though both probe and stokes fields remain significantly weaker than either control field . in fig .",
    "[ fwmanalysis.fig ] , we plot the real and imaginary parts of optical polarizations for both the probe ( top ) and stokes ( bottom ) fields , under conditions corresponding to different points along the optical path through the atomic medium .",
    "the left column represents the entrance of the vapor cell , where only the probe field is present , and @xmath48 since it is not yet generated . under these conditions , @xmath29 experiences strong gain , which leads to its spontaneous generation .",
    "the stokes field is generated at the frequency that satisfies the four - photon resonance condition  any variation in the probe two - photon detuning @xmath49 is matched by the corresponding change in the stokes field two - photon detuning @xmath50 .",
    "as the unattenuated probe light and generated stokes field propagate along the cell , the increasing strength of @xmath29 starts affecting the propagation of the probe field through the fwm coupling .",
    "in particular , the negatively - sloped refractive index is somewhat flattened out , due to appearance of a small amount of gain [ fig .",
    "[ fwmanalysis.fig](c ) ] .",
    "farther along the cell , the probe field experiences stronger gain , but the dispersion switches to non - anomalous , associated with slow - light propagation regime .",
    "the observed behavior indicates the the amplitude of the stokes field offers an additional control mechanism of the group index through , for example , the optical depth of the atomic ensemble . at the same time",
    ", the four - wave mixing process produces higher gain for the probe field at the output , and thus allows for compensation of unavoidable optical losses when operating inside a cavity .    , proportional to the refractive index and absorption for the probe field @xmath36 for for various strengths of the stokes field .",

    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) without making any additional assumptions about the parameters of the system .",
    "however , with a few reasonable approximations , we also can find an analytical solution for time - dependent weak optical fields @xmath36 and @xmath29 and strong cw optical fields @xmath37 and @xmath19 . in this case",
    "we can assume a linear response of the atomic medium in response to both weak optical fields .",

    "we make the additional approximation that the values of these density matrix elements do not change along the length of the cell .",
    "the validity of this approximation may be questioned , since , in fact , both strong fields will experience some absorption .",
    "later , we will demonstrate that in the range of strong field intensities that produce the desired fast - light regime this absorption is not significant , and the non - depletion approximation is reasonable .",
    "we are interested in calculating the propagation of the weak probe field @xmath36 , as well as in the possible generation of the four - wave mixing field @xmath29 connecting the @xmath20 and @xmath21 transition , governed by the wave equation , @xmath60 where @xmath61 are coupling coefficients for the corresponding optical transitions .",

    "we observe that , for short lengths of the atomic medium ( 15  mm and 25  mm ) , the two methods provide similar solutions , predicting small gain and some advance for the probe optical field , as well as generation of the stokes field in a slow - light regime .",
    "for the longer cell ( 50  mm ) , however , the analytical model significantly overestimates the gain in both probe and stokes fields compared to the exact numerical solution that takes into the account the attenuation of both strong control fields associated population redistribution .",
