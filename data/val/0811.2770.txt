    "we present preliminary results from a significantly improved model of sio maser emission from the circumstellar envelopes of mira - type , and similar , long - period variable stars .",
    "the predecessor of this model , hereafter the ` old model ' , was used to compute synthetic spectra and images of sio maser emission from a model star with parameters based on those of o  cet @xcite . with additional phase information , the variation of the spectra and maps",
    "was computed over the stellar period of 332d @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic solutions which provided the input physical conditions for the maser sites in the old model were taken from envelope computations by @xcite , except in the earliest of these papers , @xcite , which used similar calculations by @xcite .",
    "the old model used the ( radial ) density , velocity , and gas kinetic temperature profiles from hydrodynamic solutions by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these hydrodynamic solutions also provided a radiative equilibrium temperature , @xmath0 , on the basis of geometrical dilution of the stellar continuum , and on the opacity of the gas , but no estimate of the abundance of sio .",
    "the radius of the stellar photosphere was recalculated at each time step , and defined as the radius where the optical depth equalled 2/3 , but the effective temperature of the photospheric layer , whatever its radius , had a constant value , independent of the stellar phase .",
    "dust was included in the pulsation model , and was dynamically significant at radii beyond the condensation zone @xcite . at radii where dust was present",
    ", the dust temperature was set equal to @xmath0 .",
    "the effect of dust was exerted through a spectrally averaged radiation pressure cross section , a function of @xmath0 and the dust condensation temperature .",
    "the solutions did not specify a wavelength dependence for the dust opacity , or a dust number density , though this latter quantity could have been calculated , using sensible assumptions for the dust mass fraction , grain radius and mineral density ( see @xcite ) . later",
    "bowen models improved upon the version discussed above in several respects @xcite , but these later models were never used by us for maser calculations .",
    "the old model made several simplifications and approximations , not inherent in the willson and bowen solutions , for constructing the ir radiation field for maser pumping .",
    "the stellar component of ir radiation field assumed a fixed - radius stellar photosphere , and was modelled as a black - body at the ( constant ) stellar temperature of 3002k .",
    "optically thin dust emission was crudely modelled as a black - body at a single temperature , weighted by a power - law in wavelength @xcite . as a consequence of these approximations , the radiative pump rate in any sio rovibrational transition",
    "had no intrinsic variation with phase .",
    "although the collisional part of the maser pump was modelled more accurately than the radiative part , a radiative component to the maser pumping was , however , always present @xcite .",
    "the old model used a constant value of 10@xmath1 for the abundance of sio , independent of both radius and phase , and , for the purposes of pumping calculations , hydrogen was assumed to be in molecular form , as no suitable set of rate coefficients was then available for the h+sio system .",
    "the stellar phase in the bowen hydrodynamic solutions was defined as zero at the time a new shock left the stellar photosphere @xcite , and it was never possible reliably to relate this model phase to the optical , or near ir , light curves of the star , despite several attempts to do so , for example @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it was therefore impossible to answer questions related to observed links between the light - curves of sio masers and the optical and near - ir continuum , for example @xcite .",
    "polarization and the presence of minor isotopomers of sio were also not included in the old model ; these aspects of the problem remain absent in the new model , and will not be considered further in this work .    despite the drawbacks listed above , the old model was surprisingly successful when compared with observations .",
    "the single phase version @xcite predicted new masers with upper rotational states above @xmath2=6 .",
    "such masers were subsequently detected in a number of stars , including examples from miras and semi - regular variables @xcite .",
    "the ring structure of the sio masers , found frequently in vlbi observations @xcite , which indicates predominantly tangential amplification from a restricted range of radii , was also strongly supportive of the model .",
    "it is worth noting here that the model generated potential maser sites randomly throughout a sphere of significantly larger radius than the ring in which masers appear .",
    "if the model had been seriously inappropriate , it could have produced , for example , a smooth radial distribution , or , for predominantly radial amplification , a concentration of bright maser spots directly over the central star .",
    "the ring radius for the @xmath3 masers was found to be smaller , in a number of stars , than for @xmath4 , in agreement with the model @xcite .",
    "the model prediction for the ring radius of the masers in the @xmath5 line at 86ghz , is that it should have a comparable , or slightly larger radius than the ring formed by the @xmath4 masers , and be significantly less well populated .",
    "the second prediction seems to be in ageement with observations @xcite but not the first .",
    "observations of r  leo @xcite confirm that , in this star at least , the @xmath5 transition forms in a ring further from the star than the @xmath6 transition from the same vibrational state .",
    "single - dish observations of a number of miras with different dust temperatures @xcite showed a correlation of the flux in the 8@xmath7 m continuum and the @xmath6 masers from @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which strongly suggests a radiative component to the maser pump .",
    "the maser line ratios appear to be acceptable , given the uncertainties in what constitutes the background for unsaturated masers , except for the @xmath10 line which is much too strong when compared against observations .",
    "however , the weakness of this maser in real sources is very probably due to a line overlap with a water transition , for example @xcite , and a molecular model of water was ( and is ) not included in our maser model .    when phase dependence is added , the old model remains broadly in agreement with interferometric observations , though with some discrepancies .",
    "for example the model prediction of smaller maser rings , at @xmath3 , compared with @xmath4 , over the stellar cycle , is in agreement with observations @xcite , as is the prediction of an r.m.s .",
    "amplitude variation of 5 - 10 per cent in the maser ring radius .",
    "these maser rings are also found to be inside the inner radius of the silicate dust shell , but al@xmath11o@xmath12 dust may be co - located with the masers @xcite . however , the predicted relation between sio maser ring radius and sio maser luminosity is not well reproduced , and varies both between different stars , and for different pulsation cycles of the same star @xcite .",
    "long term monitoring of the @xmath4 line in the mira tx  cam @xcite shows motions dominated by shock - driven outflow for part of the stellar period , whilst the remainder is dominated by infall under gravity .",
    "this behaviour agrees with the model assuming a reasonable link between the model and optical phases , though the variation in the maser ring radius is somewhat larger ( 18 per cent ) in tx  cam .",
    "it should also be noted that tx  cam exhibits considerable asymmetric behaviour , and some maser features move outwards , for example , even during the infall dominated phase .",
    "if the model to optical phase relation used by @xcite is adopted ( model phase = 0.78 at optical maximum ) then the disrupted , weak maser ring structure found near optical minimum in tx  cam is also consistent with observations , though any linking of the old model and optical phases should be treated with great caution for reasons discussed above .",
    "single dish monitoring observations suggest that shock waves , at least of a type which take a significant fraction of the period to cross the gap between the stellar photosphere and the maser zone , can not be responsible for the maser pumping , though some observations still suggest a coupling between the pump and the kinematics of the envelope gas .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed discussion of the problems involved in relating results from interferometric and single - dish observations . whilst it is not true to say that the old model is entirely collisionally pumped ,",
    "a major drawback is that it can not explain correlation between the light curves of sio masers and radiation in the ir pumping bands .",
    "it is clear that such correlations exist : @xcite found that the optical , near - ir continuum and sio masers share the same period in a sample of 13 mira variables .",
    "they also found the ir and sio maser peak luminosities coincided to within 0.05 of a stellar period .",
    "the ir data in @xcite is at 4.9 and 3.5@xmath7 m , and therefore does not include the crucial @xmath13 pumping band of sio at 8@xmath7 m .",
    "@xcite finds that the maxima in the 43ghz masers from @xmath14 occur simultaneously to within @xmath15 periods in o  cet . as the @xmath16 maser ring was apparently much larger than those at @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    ", this suggests that the pumping is predominantly radiative .",
    "however , the old model makes no prediction about @xmath16 masers , and the difference between the ring radii at @xmath8 and @xmath9 is sufficiently small ( @xmath170.1 to @xmath170.2au , dependent on phase ) that a shock of reasonable speed could propagate between them in 0.066 of a period ( 22d ) .",
    "these observations @xcite also did not detect any disruption of the maser activity , due to shock arrival , near optical minimum .",
    "further analysis with the same dataset from o  cet @xcite finds that sio maser flux density in the @xmath4 transition is correlated with the velocity centroid of the emission .",
    "@xcite offers two possibilities for this correlation : either the pump affects the kinematics of the maser region ( that is , shocks strongly influence maser amplification , principally through disruption of velocity - coherent gain paths , but also by heating and compressing the gas ) or that the maser pump and ( independent ? )",
    "kinematic effects combine to produce the observed maser spectra .",
    "the current authors find this second possibility hard to reconcile with the model , since in the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) approximation used , the sobolev optical depth in any direction is dependent upon the velocity gradient , and therefore the kinematics are intimately coupled to the pumping scheme .",
    "similar observations for the mira r  cas @xcite largely agree with those from o  cet .",
    "however , it is interesting that for one maximum , the peaks of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath6 masers are significantly separated in phase .",
    "the pulsating atmospheres of miras are very extended because of dynamic events , such as shocks .",
    "these extended atmospheres exhibit phase - dependent temperature and density stratifications , optically thick molecular layers , and dust formation ; see for example @xcite .",
    "observed radii of miras have been found to depend on both phase and wavelength of observation , which is consistent with the predictions of dynamic models , in which molecular layers lie above the continuum - forming layer @xcite . in a series of experiments @xcite mid - ir interferometric measurements made with the vlti",
    "were made near contemporaneously with vlba observations of the 43ghz masers in @xmath8 and @xmath9 towards the mira s  ori .",
    "models @xcite were fitted to four observing epochs , with an estimated error of @xmath180.15 pulsation periods between the model and optical phases . both the ir photosphere radius , defined as the radius at 1.04@xmath7 m , and the radius of the optically thick layer near 8@xmath7 m ( the @xmath13 sio pumping band ) vary in phase with the optical light curve , as far as can be judged from the limited phase sampling .",
    "importantly , the radius of the 43ghz maser shells is slightly larger than this 8@xmath7 m quasi - photospheric band radius at all four observing epochs .",
    "if this optically thick layer represents high - density post - shock gas , then the position of the shock would be tightly correlated with the light curve at this frequency , very possibly leading to a resolution of the radiative / collisional pumping debate .",
    "recent work by @xcite suggests that , with certain caveats , the conclusions obtained for s  ori can be extended to a sample of other mira variables .",
    "our improved model removes many of the defects inherent in the old version because of its restricted information about conditions in the circumstellar envelope .",
    "in particular , the new version includes radii for several optically thick layers , for both continua and restricted - wavelength bands , as a function of phase .",
    "the set of bands includes all the ir pumping bands of sio which are accessible to the model .",
    "other features of the new model include an accurate estimate of the ir radiation field from dust , sufficient chemistry to provide abundances for sio and its main collision partners , and new rate coefficients for collisions of sio with hydrogen atoms . a link between the model phase ( in terms of the shock position ) and the stellar light curve is implicitly included in the model data .    at this point",
    "we digress to make some definitions regarding the optically thick layers introduced above .",
    "we reserve the word ` photosphere ' to mean a continuum - forming layer , and we always use this word with a modifier which specifies the region of the spectrum to which it applies . in particular , we define ` ir photosphere ' to be the continuum - forming layer at 1.04where the optical depth is equal to 1 .",
    "this wavelength was chosen because it is in a region little contaminated by molecular line absorption .",
    "we use ` radio photosphere ' to be the continuum - forming layer in the radio region .",
    "this is less well defined , but , in the context of sio , can be taken to mean the region of the electromagnetic spectrum occupied by the pure rotational lines of sio in general , and the maser lines at 43 and 86ghz in particular .",
    "when referring to other work , for example the hydrodynamic solutions of the old model , which does not match the precise definition of the ir photosphere , we use the expression , ` stellar photosphere ' , to describe the continuum - forming layer in the optical and near ir . where photospheric radii have already been mentioned in the introduction , they conform to the above definitions .",
    "each sio pumping band has a quasi - photospheric , optically thick , layer , due to the presence of large numbers of molecular lines , mostly from water .",
    "these layers have radii computed as @xmath19 radii based on the definition of the filter radius in @xcite using a box filter of width 0.1 . when referring to these optically thick layers , the form of words we adopt is ` optically thick band radius ' , or ` optically thick layer ' .",
    "when referring only to the radii of such layers , we write a shorter form , specifying the wavelength of the band in microns , followed by ` radius ' .",
    "for example , to refer to the radius of the optically thick molecular layer in the @xmath13 band of sio , we use the shorthand ` 8.14radius ' .",
    "the hydrodynamic solutions used in the present work are based on those published in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we are particularly interested in the m - series of models , drawn from the latter work .",
    "all these models have a pulsation period of 332d , like the real star o  cet and the old model .",
    "however , other parameters of the m - series models might be more appropriate for a model of r  leo .",
    "the abundance of sio is computed by an additional code by ohnaka",
    ". this code employs equilibrium chemistry , including 34 elements and 235 molecular species , and assumes solar abundances of the reactants .",
    "optically thick band radii are provided in the sio rovibrational pumping bands at 2.03 , 2.74 , 4.09 and 8.14@xmath7 m , corresponding to vibrational changes , respectively , of @xmath20 4 , 3 , 2 and 1 .",
    ".parameters for the m - series models @xcite .",
    "the radius r@xmath21 refers to the parent star ( see text ) .",
    "the effective temperature and luminosity are computed for the non - pulsating parent star .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the outer shock appears to be well outside the maser zone , except at phase 0.1 , where it may be associated with the large @xmath5 ring ( see column  9 ) . at most phases , the inner shock ,",
    "the 8.13radius and the maser ring radii of all the lines are within 0.3r@xmath22 of each other .",
    "this association does not involve the inner shock at phase 0.1 .",
    "the inner edge of the al@xmath11o@xmath12 dust , r@xmath23 ( column  5 ) is less well associated with masers , inner shock and 8.13radius .",
    "it is close to the maser ring radius at phase 0.25 and 0.4 , but not at phases 0.1 and 0.3 .",
    "the maser rings themselves are closely associated for almost all transitions and phases .",
    "the exception is the large ring at phase 0.1 for the @xmath5 transition .",
    "the ring radius for this transition is not peculiar at the other phases . in the first three phases ,",
    "the mean ring radius of the @xmath3 masers is the same , or slightly smaller than that for the analogous transition in @xmath8 .",
    "this trend is swapped for phase 0.4 , but this phase has a large standard deviation , due to the small number of surviving spots , and a rather poorly defined ring . at this phase , close to optical minimum ,",
    "the masers from both @xmath6 ( 43ghz ) transitions have their largest mean ring radii in both observations and theory .",
    "the model is therefore consistent with previous models and with vlbi observations which show that the @xmath3 ring is usually slightly smaller .",
    "the large ring for the @xmath5 masers at phase 0.1 is not in agreement with the old model , but is more in line with vlbi observations @xcite .",
    "the modelled ring radii at 43ghz are also smaller than their observational counterparts , for the three phases where observational data exist .",
    "however , the ring sizes are consistent , given the standard deviations attached to these ring radii .",
    "maser spectra in the 43ghz ( @xmath6 ) lines have velocity extents of @xmath1710kms@xmath24 , a value which is consistent with the observational spectra of these lines towards s  ori @xcite .",
    "the lsr velocity of s  ori is not very well known , so we have not computed doppler biases for our spectra , though these model spectra are certainly concentrated to the red side of the velocity range .",
    "perhaps the largest drawback of the current work , in terms of matching vlba observations of s  ori , is in the variation of spectral intensity . in the three observed phases , the ratio of the spectral maxima for the brightest and dimmest phases is about 1.5 for the @xmath4 line , and about 2 for @xmath3 .",
    "by contrast , the fading of the model masers towards phase 0.4 gives analogous ratios of approximately 70 and 1000 .",
    "however , as has been noted previously , our models are not evolved in phase , but use repositioned spots , so the numbers could be very different if the masers followed the gas motions .",
    "there are also only a small number of bright spots , so these ratios are very vulnerable to statistical fluctuations .",
    "the new combined maser and hydrodynamic solutions produce maser emission in rings of typical size 2.2 ir photospheric radii .",
    "the ring structures are similar in many respects to those produced by the old model .",
    "an analysis of ring radii confirms the usual observational result , and the prediction of the old model , that the @xmath25 ring is smaller than the @xmath8 ring at 43ghz , whilst a large ring is possible at some phases in the @xmath5 transition at 86ghz .",
    "the overall range of maser ring radii , from 1.8 - 2.4 ir photospheric radii , for the 43ghz transitions in @xmath8 and @xmath25 is also consistent with vlbi experiments where maser rings and photospheric radii have been compared at the same phase @xcite",
    ".    if a radio photosphere of approximately 2 ir photospheric radii is used , observable shock velocities are in agreement with actual radio continuum observations , as high velocity shocks , such as the inner shock at phase 0.1 , are hidden .",
    "a radio photosphere of this size also prevents the appearance of extremely bright masers very close to the ir photosphere .",
    "dust can both suppress and enhance maser emission , and there is definitely a radiative component to the pumping scheme .",
    "however , the close association of shock and 8.13micron radii suggests that collisional and radiative pumping are closely associated spatially , and therefore temporally .",

    "<S> we describe a combined dynamic atmosphere and maser propagation model of sio maser emission in mira variables . </S>",
    "<S> this model rectifies many of the defects of an earlier model of this type , particularly in relation to the infra - red ( ir ) radiation field generated by dust and various wavelength - dependent , optically thick layers . </S>",
    "<S> modelled masers form in rings with radii consistent with those found in vlbi observations and with earlier models . </S>",
    "<S> this agreement requires the adoption of a radio photosphere of radius approximately twice that of the stellar photosphere , in agreement with observations . </S>",
    "<S> a radio photosphere of this size renders invisible certain maser sites with high amplification at low radii , and conceals high - velocity shocks , which are absent in radio continuum observations . </S>",
    "<S> the sio masers are brightest at an optical phase of 0.1 to 0.25 , which is consistent with observed phase - lags . </S>",
    "<S> dust can have both mild and profound effects on the maser emission . </S>",
    "<S> maser rings , a shock and the optically thick layer in the sio pumping band at 8.13appear to be closely associated in three out of four phase samples .    [ firstpage ]    stars : agb and post - agb  stars : evolution  masers  circumstellar matter  radio lines : stars  </S>"
