    "the displacement of a viscous fluid by a less - viscous one in a hele - shaw cell , the so - called saffman - taylor problem @xcite , is a prototypical pattern formation problem . since the seminal work of saffman and taylor @xcite a considerable effort has been aimed at understanding both steady and unsteady interfacial patterns formed during this flow .",
    "the saffman - taylor problem is the simplest member of a wide class of interfacial pattern formation problems such as free dendritic growth , directional solidification , or chemical electro - deposition @xcite . as such ,",
    "a theoretical understanding of hele - shaw flow may help elucidate generic behavior common to many pattern forming systems . despite its relatively simple formulation and the large amount of work devoted to it ,",
    "however , several aspects of interfacial dynamics in hele - shaw flow are still poorly understood , in particular concerning the highly nonlinear and nonlocal dynamics of finger competition .",
    "one of the main reasons for the wide interest in hele - shaw flow , at least from a mathematical point of view , is that explicit time - dependent solutions can be found in the case of zero surface tension @xcite .",
    "however , it is also known that the zero surface tension saffman - taylor ( st ) problem is ill - posed as an initial value problem @xcite and finite - time singularities appear frequently @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , rather large classes of zero surface tension solutions have been found which exhibit the variety of morphologies observed both in experiments and numerical simulations .",
    "then , the question that naturally arises is to what extent smooth ( nonsingular ) zero surface tension solutions reproduce the dynamics of the physical problem with finite surface tension , in particular in the limit of vanishing dimensionless surface tension , @xmath0 .",
    "it is well known that surface tension is a singular perturbation to the zero surface tension problem @xcite .",
    "this singular character manifests dramatically in the classical selection problem posed by saffman and taylor @xcite and only solved three decades later @xcite , where an arbitrarily small surface tension selects out a single , stable solution from the continuum of steady single - finger @xmath1 solutions .",
    "another manifestation of the singular nature of surface tension which is directly relevant to the present work is its effect on the dynamics .",
    "siegel , tanveer and dai @xcite showed that interfacial evolution for the regularized problem ( i.e. , vanishingly small @xmath2 ) may differ signifficantly from that for the @xmath1 problem in order one time . then , smooth time dependent solutions of the @xmath1 case do not coincide , in general , with the limiting solutions for @xmath0 .",
    "accordingly , the study of finite @xmath2 dynamics encounters considerable difficulties since @xmath1 solutions can not be naively used as a starting point for the study of the problem with finite @xmath2 .",
    "the physical content of exact zero surface tension solutions with pole - like singularities has been recently addressed in refs .",
    "@xcite using a dynamical systems approach . through a detailed study",
    "it has been shown that the exact zero - surface tension phase flow , considered in a global sense , is structurally unstable .",
    "in other words , the zero surface tension phase dynamics are _ not topologically equivalent to the phase space flow of the physical problem , regularized by surface tension .",
    "indeed , the zero surface tension phase flow omits the necessary saddle - point structure of multifinger fixed points , which is crucial to the physical finger competition process  @xcite .",
    "a natural extension of the well known solvability mechanism ( first applied to ` select ' a finger of width 1/2 out of a continuum of solutions in the single finger case ) was proposed for multi - finger solutions in  @xcite ; this helps clarify how the introduction of surface tension modifies the global phase space structure of the flow and restores the hyperbolicity of multi - finger fixed points .",
    "_    the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , however , was qualitative in nature and could not quantify the extent to which zero surface tension trajectories might resemble the evolution with small surface tension .",
    "in particular it was recognized that , while some trajectories appear to be qualitatively correct for infinite time , others may have a dramatically different evolution .",
    "in particular , adding an infinitessimal surface tension could give the opposite outcome in the finger competition , that is , make the ` losing ' finger for @xmath1 become the ` winning ' finger when @xmath3 , for sufficiently generic sets of initial conditions .",
    "a satisfactory analytical understanding of the problem with @xmath4 has been achieved in two regimes : the initial linear instability of the flat interface followed by the weakly non - linear regime @xcite , and the asymptotic regime where surface tension selects the width of the single finger @xcite .",
    "the highly non - linear intermediate regime that connects the quasi - planar interface with the asymptotic single - finger regime has mostly been studied through numerical computation .",
    "the first exhaustive numerical studies were reported by tryggvason and aref @xcite , who paid considerable attention to the influence of viscosity contrast on the problem and studied both single - finger and multi - finger configurations .",
    "later , casademunt and jasnow @xcite showed that the basin of attraction of the single - finger solution depends strongly on viscosity contrast and that only when one of the two fluid viscosities is negligible it can be claimed that the single finger is the universal attractor of the problem . in the present work we will restrict to this limiting case .",
    "degregoria and schwartz @xcite observed that well - developed fingers split when surface tension is sufficiently decreased .",
    "this tip - splitting instability is related to the fact that the saffman - taylor finger is linearly stable but non - linearly unstable , and the size of the perturbation that triggers the tip - splitting decreases quickly with surface tension @xcite .",
    "dai and shelley  @xcite showed that for small @xmath2 numerical computations are extremely sensitive to the precision used in the computations .",
    "as a consequence noise level has to be controlled with care in order to ensure that the computation is sufficiently accurate .",
    "@xcite developed a numerical method that deals with the numerical stiffness of the problem in an efficient manner , aiding the ability to perform long time computations .",
    "more recently ceniceros _",
    "@xcite , using very high precision arithmetic have been able to study the effect of extremely small surface tension in the circular geometry with suction , and they have observed that surface tension can produce complex ramified patters even without the presence of noise . _ _    an analytical treatment of this highly nonlinear and nonlocal free - boundary problem faces challenging difficulties . in particular , a perturbative study for small @xmath2 is complicated by the ill - posedness of the zero surface tension problem .",
    "tanveer @xcite was able to overcome this obstacle by embedding the zero surface tension problem in a well - posed one .",
    "in addition , this well - posed extension of the @xmath1 problem allowed baker _ et al .",
    "@xcite to develop a numerical method to compute the time evolution of zero surface tension dynamics in a well - posed manner .",
    "once the @xmath1 problem is formulated in a well - posed way the @xmath4 case can be studied using a perturbative approach .",
    "the main result of the asymptotic perturbative theory developed by tanveer @xcite is that the effect of surface tension may be manifest in a @xmath5 time : the evolution of the same initial interface for @xmath1 and @xmath4 will in general differ after a time of order one , even if the @xmath1 solution is smooth for all time .",
    "@xcite have extended the work of ref .",
    "@xcite to later stages of the evolution , and through numerical computation for very small values of @xmath2 they showed that smooth @xmath1 solutions are indeed significantly affected by the presence of arbitrarily small @xmath2 in order - one time , thus confirming the predictions of the perturbative theory .",
    "the zero surface tension solutions studied by siegel _",
    "@xcite in the channel geometry were single - finger solutions with an asymptotic width @xmath6 , specifically chosen to be incompatible with selection theory for vanishing surface tension .",
    "they found that the singular effect of surface tension was to widen the finger in order to reach the selected width .",
    "the surprising feature here is that the effect of surface tension is felt in order - one time , i.e. , that the time lapse for which the regularized solution approaches the unperturbed one as @xmath0 is bounded . _ _ _    the present paper expands the work of refs .",
    "@xcite in the spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite , towards the study of multi - finger solutions .",
    "however , unlike the studies of @xcite we chose zero surface tension multi - finger soltuions which are compatible with asymptotic selection theory , that is , with an asymptotic finger width @xmath7the selected value in the limit @xmath0 . in this way we isolate the intrinsic finger competition dynamics from the selection effects responsible of restoring the asymptotic width .",
    "two different kinds of two - finger zero surface tension solutions are studied , and in both cases it is shown that surface tension acts as a singular perturbation to the dynamics in order - one time , modifying dramatically the late time configuration of the interface not only quantitatively but also qualitatively . specifically we show that paths in phase space associated with zero and nonzero surface tension evolution , and indeed the global topological structure of the the phase spaces , may differ appreciably , even for arbitrarily small @xmath2 . in physical terms , our evidence suggests that the presence of arbitrarily small surface tension can completely alter outcome of finger competition when compared with the zero surface tension evolution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ zero_b ] the equations describing hele - shaw flow are introduced , and a class of two - finger zero surface tension solutions relevant to two - finger competition is presented and briefly discussed .",
    "this class of solutions will be used as initial condition for numerical computation with @xmath8 . in sec .",
    "[ asymp ] the basic features of the asymptotic theory are recalled , and the theory is applied to the zero surface tension solutions introduced in the previous section .",
    "the numerical computations with finite ( but small ) @xmath2 are presented in sec .",
    "[ numerics ] .",
    "[ concl ] discusses and summarizes the results obtained in previous sections .",
    "in this section we present the equations which govern the interfacial dynamics in a rectilinear hele - shaw cell , following the formalism of @xcite .",
    "we consider a class of exact , time - dependent zero surface tension solutions that are relevant to the finger competition problem , and briefly describe the solutions within this class .",
    "consider hele - shaw flow in the channel geometry , in which a fluid of negligible viscosity displaces a viscous liquid .",
    "the equations governing the interfacial evolution can be conveniently formulated by first introducing a conformal map @xmath9 which takes the interior of the unit semicircle in the @xmath10 plane into the region occupied by the viscous fluid in the complex plane @xmath11 , in such a way that the arc @xmath12 for @xmath13 $ ] is mapped to the interface and the diameter of the semi - circle is mapped to the channel walls .",
    "the mapping function @xmath9 has the form @xmath14 , and inside and on the unit semi - circle we require @xmath15 to be analytic and @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , we require that @xmath17 on the real diameter of the semi - circle .",
    "this latter condition ensures that @xmath18 maps the diameter to the channel walls . under suitable assumptions ( see @xcite ) the schwartz reflection principle may be applied to show that @xmath19 is analytic and @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "the effective velocity field , averaged across the plate gap , is a two - dimensional potential flow satisfying darcy s law @xmath22 here @xmath23 is a velocity potential defined by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the pressure , @xmath26 is the viscosity and @xmath27 is the gap width . under the assumption of incompressibility @xmath28",
    "the potential satisfies laplace s equation @xmath29 incompressibility also implies the existence of a stream function @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , one can define a complex velocity potential @xmath31 which is analytic for @xmath18 in the fluid region of the channel .",
    "its form as a function of @xmath10 reads @xmath32 where @xmath33 is an analytic function inside the unit circle .",
    "the condition that there is no flow through the walls implies that @xmath34 must hold on the real diameter of the unit semi - circle . in the absence of surface tension , @xmath35 ( see eq .",
    "( [ evol2 ] ) ) .    at the interface we impose the usual boundary conditions .",
    "the kinematic boundary condition states that the normal component of fluid velocity at a point on the interface equals the normal velocity of the interface at that point , and takes the form @xmath36=\\frac{1}{|z_{\\zeta}|^2 } { \\rm re}\\left[\\zeta w_{\\zeta}\\right].\\ ] ] the dynamic boundary condition specifies that the pressure jump across the interface is balanced by surface tension , and is given by @xmath37.\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath2 is the nondimensional surface tension and is defined by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the surface tension , @xmath40 is the fluid velocity at infinity and @xmath41 is half the cell width .",
    "the equations given in ( 1)-(5 ) are in nondimensional form , with lengths and velocities nondimensionalized by @xmath41 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "when @xmath1 it is well known that pole singularities in @xmath42 ( i.e. in @xmath43 ) present in the exterior of the unit disk are preserved under the dynamics , i.e. , such singularities are neither created nor destroyed , although the location of those which are initially present will evolve with time .",
    "exact @xmath1 solutions consisting of a collection of pole singularities with constant amplitude have been the focus of extensive studies ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest such solution leading to nontrivial finger competition consists of a pair of singularites in the upper halfplane of @xmath44 , located at positions that are symmetric with respect to the y - axis .",
    "a second pair of poles conjugate to the first pair is required to satisfy the symmetry restriction  ( [ symm ] ) .",
    "this exact solution takes the form @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath6 and @xmath46 are real constants with @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is real .",
    "the singularity locations are given by the complex parameter @xmath50 , which satisfies a simple differential equation given in @xcite .",

    "we employ the convention that @xmath50 is a complex number in the first quadrant .",
    "the amplitudes of the singularities , given here by the numbers @xmath52 and its conjugate , are chosen so that the asymptotic form of the solution consists of one or two steadily propagating fingers of total width @xmath6 .",
    "the parameter @xmath46 determines the nature of the finger competition for @xmath1 .",
    "the solution  ( [ fepsilon ] ) describes generically two different fingers of the nonviscous phase penetrating the viscous one . in the linear regime @xmath53",
    "the interface consists of a single bump or finger , and as time increases a second finger may develop and grow , depending on the value of @xmath54 .",
    "we summarize the features of the solution  ( [ fepsilon ] ) that are most relevant to the study of finger competition .",
    "consider first @xmath55 . in this case",
    "the asymptotic configuration consists of one or two fingers of total width @xmath6 , depending on the initial condition .",
    "the singularities move toward the unit disk , with the limit as @xmath56 denoted by @xmath57 .",
    "when @xmath58 the asymptotic configuration is a single saffman - taylor finger growing in the center of the channel ( this asymptotic configuration is denoted st(r ) ) , for @xmath59 it is a ` side ' saffman - taylor finger i.e. a pair of half fingers of total width @xmath6 with tips located at the cell walls ( denoted st(l ) ) , and for @xmath60 it is a ` double ' saffman - taylor finger , namely two identical fingers of width @xmath61 with tips at @xmath62 ( denoted 2st ) .",
    "for any other value of @xmath63 the asymptotic configuration consists of two unequal steadily growing fingers .",
    "the two - finger asymptotic configuration is a consequence of the continuum of fixed points that is present in the phase portrait of the dynamical variables which govern the shape of the interface , namely @xmath64 . in order to correspond to the notation of @xcite",
    "introduce the variable @xmath65 .",
    "then the planar interface corresponds to @xmath66 , the center saffman - taylor finger to @xmath67 , the side saffman - taylor finger to @xmath68 , and the double saffman - taylor finger to @xmath69 .",

    "( [ fepsilon ] ) exhibits ` successful ' competition , in the sense that the asymptotic interface shape consists of a single saffman - taylor finger or side saffman - taylor finger .",
    "the price to pay is the appearance of finite time singularities for a certain subset of initial conditions , in the form of a zero of @xmath42 impacting the unit disk ( this is a generic feature of conformal map solutions @xmath42 composed of a finite number of pole singularities ",
    "see  @xcite ) .",
    "then , only the subset of initial conditions free of finite time singularities is capable of sustaining finger competition all the way to the @xmath56 outcome .",
    "nevertheless , one may ask whether the class of @xmath1 solutions that are free of finite time singularities may describe , at least qualitatively , the physical finger competition for positive surface tension in the limit @xmath0 .    in the following sections we focus on the class of initial data for which the @xmath1 solutions are devoid of finite time singularities , and",

    "we develop a general theory for how the presence of positive surface tension affects the outcome of finger competition .",
    "this will enable us to predict the winner of finger competition , i.e. , the eventual asymptotic state .",
    "most interestingly , we find instances in which the presence of arbitrarily small surface tension leads to dramatically different outcomes in finger competition when compared with the zero surface tension evolution .",
    "little is known about the effect of finite ( but small ) surface tension @xmath2 on the dynamics of zero surface tension multifinger solutions , and in particular on the class of exact solutions  ( [ fepsilon ] ) .",
    "for single finger configurations , steady state selection theory predicts that the finger can not have an arbitrary width .",
    "indeed , for vanishing surface tension @xmath0 the width @xmath7 is selected , asymptotically in time .",
    "thus , it is clear that surface tension has a critical influence on single finger solutions with @xmath76 .",
    "the nature of this influence in the limit @xmath0 has been investigated by siegel , tanveer and dai @xcite , who present evidence that zero surface tension single finger solutions with @xmath77 are significantly perturbed by the inclusion of an arbitrarily small amount of surface tension in order one time .",
    "the effect of surface tension is an increase of the finger width to reach the width predicted by selection theory .",
    "consider now the effect of small surface tension on the exact ( @xmath1 ) two finger solution  ( [ fepsilon ] ) .",
    "when @xmath78 the asymptotic perturbation theory developed in refs .",
    "@xcite can be applied .",
    "this perturbation theory describes the effects of the introduction of a small amount of surface tension on initial data @xmath79 specified in the extended complex plane , i.e. , in a domain including the ` unphysical ' region @xmath80 ( the extended domain is required to make the @xmath1 problem well - posed ) .",
    "the effect of finite @xmath2 is most important near isolated zeros and singularities of @xmath81 , where a regular perturbation expansion in @xmath2 breaks down .",
    "( away from these points the perturbation expansion is regular , at least initially . ) for the class of solutions  ( [ fepsilon ] ) we are discussing , the isolated singularities of @xmath82 are simple poles .",
    "the theory suggests that the introduction of finite surface tension modifies the poles ( @xmath83 ) by transforming them into localized clusters of @xmath84 singularities , but these clusters move at leading order according to the @xmath1 dynamics .",
    "thus the effect of one of these clusters on the interface is approximately equivalent to that of the unperturbed ( @xmath1 ) pole - like singularity that has given birth to it .",
    "the influence of surface tension on the zeros of @xmath81 is more complex .",
    "each initial zero instantly gives birth to two localized inner regions , i.e. , regions where the @xmath1 and @xmath3 solutions differ by @xmath5 .",
    "one of the two inner regions moves , at least initially , according to the @xmath1 dynamics of the original zero @xmath85   zero once the second inner region discussed below has impacted the unit disk .",
    "we do not consider this possibility here . ] .",
    "since the particular zero surface tension solutions considered here have zeros that are either bounded away from the unit disk for all time or impact the unit disk only after long times , the inner region around @xmath86 has a negligible influence on the interface .",
    "the second inner region created around @xmath87 moves differently .",
    "the theory suggests that this inner region consists of a cluster of singularities , whose size scales like @xmath88 . unlike the case discussed above this second inner region moves away from the @xmath1 zero since , to leading order in @xmath2",
    ", it moves like a _ singularity _ of the zero surface tension problem and this speed is different form the speed of the zero @xmath86 which spawned the cluster . as this singularity cluster approaches the physical domain it may perturb the flow and the interface shape may differ significantly from that at @xmath1 shape .",
    "the location of this singularity cluster will be denoted by @xmath89 , and following @xcite we shall call it the daughter singularity .",
    "we emphasize that the dynamics of the daughter singularity cluster is determined at lowest order solely by the @xmath1 solution @xmath90 , at least until it arrives at the surroundings of the unit circle , and therefore can be simply computed once the initial locations of the zeros of @xmath91 are determined .    the daughter singularity evolution equation is given by ( see @xcite ) @xmath92 where @xmath93 is defined by @xmath94}{|z^0_\\zeta(\\zeta',t)|^2}\\ ] ] and the superscript 0 denotes that the function evaluations are done using the corresponding @xmath1 solution .",
    "the function @xmath95 also gives the characteristic velocity of a pole or branch point singularity of @xmath96 located at position @xmath10 in the region @xmath44 .",

    "this is a dramatic consequence of the singular nature of surface tension on the dynamics of finger competition which is not related to steady state selection , but confirms the ideas of the proposed dynamical solvability scenario in ref .",
    "the asymptotic theory developed in refs .",
    "@xcite predicts the existence of regions of the complex plane where the zero surface tension solution and the finite surface tension solution differ by @xmath5 .",
    "these regions are the daughter singularity clusters , and their influence is felt in the physical interface when they are close to the unit circle .",
    "daughter singularities move towards the unit circle , and when their motion is not impeded by other singularities they reach the unit circle in @xmath5 time .",
    "when the distance between the daughter singularity and the unit circle is @xmath127 the interface can display @xmath5 discrepancies with respect the interface of the @xmath1 solutions .",
    "however , the asymptotic theory does not predict the nature of the discrepancies caused by daughter singularity impact .",
    "siegel _ et al .",
    "@xcite showed numerically that the effect of the daughter singularity impact on the tip ( in a single - finger configuration with @xmath77 ) was a retard in the velocity of the finger accompanied by a widening of the finger .",
    "however , this provided small insight on the effect of the impact in multi - finger configurations , where finger competition could be substantially affected by the presence of finite surface tension , as suggested in refs .",
    "_    since the precise effect of the daughter singularity can not be established by the asymptotic theory it is necessary to use numerical computation in order to establish the effects of daughter singularity on the dynamics of the interface .",
    "we have focused our efforts on uncovering the role of surface tension in the dynamics of two finger configurations , which is the simplest situation exhibiting nontrivial finger competition .",
    "two different types of two - finger zero surface tension solutions have been studied .",
    "the first type ( @xmath55 ) does not exhibit finger competition when @xmath1 but rather contains asymptotic configurations consisting of two unequal steady fingers advancing with the same speed .",
    "these two - finger steady state solutions form a continuum of fixed points in the phase space of the corresponding , reduced dynamical system , which is structurally unstable .",
    "numerical computations with small surface tension show that the introduction of a small @xmath2 removes the continuum of fixed points and triggers the competition process which was absent for @xmath1 by restoring the saddle - point ( hyperbolic ) structure of the appropriate multifinger fixed point .",
    "the second type ( @xmath167 ) of two - finger solution we have studied exhibits finger competition for @xmath1 , but the numerical computation with small @xmath2 has shown that the long time configuration of the computed interface may be _ qualitatively different from the @xmath1 solution for a broad set of initial conditions , in the sense that the finger that ` wins ' the competition is not the same with and without surface tension . thus , the presence of surface tension seemingly can change the outcome of finger competition even in configurations that are well behaved and smooth for all time and whose asymptotic width is fully compatible with the predictions of selection theory for vanishing surface tension .",
    "this unexpected result shows that surface tension is not only necessary to select the asymptotic width and to prevent cusp formation , but plays also an essential role in multifinger dynamics through a drastic reconfiguration of the phase space flow structure .",
    "_    our calculations support the conjecture that impact on either the shorter or larger finger retards the velocity of that finger , and is accompanied by the widening of the larger finger . as a consequence , in general the outcome of finger competition",
    "is independent of the particular finger on which the impact first occurs , and the finger which is leading at the time of the daughter singularity impact ` wins ' the competition .",
    "this recipe fails only for interfacial configurations with very similar fingers , when not only the position of the finger ( which finger is leading ) but also the tip velocities ( a trailing finger can have for a certain time a larger velocity than the leading one ) at the impact time may play a role .",
    "the main conclusion of the present work is that surface tension is essential to describe multifinger dynamics and finger competition , even when the corresponding zero surface tension evolution is well behaved and compatible with selection theory .",
    "that is , we have detected singular effects of surface tension on the dynamics of finger competition that are not directly related to steady state selection .",
    "these can be properly interpreted in the context of an extended dynamical selection scenario as described in ref .",
    "@xcite where the reconfiguration of phase space flow by surface tension can be traced back to the restoring of hyperbolicity of multifinger fixed points .",
