    "it has long been thought that quiescent low mass x - ray binaries ( qlmxbs ) dominate the most luminous of the dim sources in globular clusters ( hertz & grindlay 1983 , verbunt et al .",
    "recent observations using chandra / acis imaging and spectroscopy have demonstrated that this is indeed the case .",
    "two systems , x5 and x7 in the massive globular cluster 47 tuc were previously suspected to be qlmxbs ( hasinger , johnston & verbunt 1994 , verbunt & hasinger 1998 ) but the sensitivity and resolution of _ chandra _  was required to confirm this suspicion ( grindlay et al .",
    "2001a , hereafter ghe01a and heinke et al . 2001a , in preparation , hereafter hgl01 ) .",
    "one qlmxb has also been found in each of ngc 6397 ( grindlay et al .",
    "2001b ; hereafter ghe01b ) and @xmath3 cen ( rutledge et al .",
    "these 4 qlmxb systems all have thermal spectra that are well modeled by hydrogen atmospheres of hot neutron stars ( nss ) , with no power law components required . none of them are obviously variable with the exception of x5 ( hgl01 ) which shows deep eclipses as well as dips showing increased neutral hydrogen ( x7 shows marginal evidence for a 5.5 hr period ) .",
    "the logical extension of this work is to search for optical counterparts to these sources , using the potent combination of _ chandra _  and _ hst_. with astrometric errors @xmath4 01 routinely being achieved for x - ray sources , optical identifications are being reported with unprecedented frequency .",
    "these identifications include cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and by draconis variables ( ghe01a , ghe01b ) , millisecond pulsars ( msps ; edmonds et al .",
    "2001 , hereafter egh01 and ferraro et al . 2001 ) and active lmxbs ( heinke et al .",
    "2001b and white & angelini 2001 ) .",
    "searches for optical counterparts to qlmxbs have been less successful .",
    "no counterpart has been found for the ngc 6397 qlmxb ( any possible companion has @xmath5 > 11 ; ghe01b ) while the @xmath3 cen qlmxb lies outside the field of view ( fov ) of current _ hst _  datasets and stellar crowding will limit deep searches from the ground . here",
    ", we report the use of high quality _ chandra_and _ hst _  data to search for optical counterparts to the 47 tuc qlmxbs x5 and x7 . we have discovered a faint , blue and variable counterpart to the eclipsing x5 , as reported briefly in ghe01a .",
    "this detection , combined with the well determined period , distance , inclination and x - ray spectrum of x5 makes this the best constrained qlmxb known .",
    "we also report limits on the qlmxb x7 .",
    "the astrometry , photometry and time series for both of these searches are described below .",
    "details of the _ chandra _  data used here are given by ghe01a and hgl01 .",
    "the qlmxbs x5 and x7 have 4576 and 5488 counts respectively ( over the 72 ksec observation ) , with internal , 1@xmath6 errors of 00082 and 00089 respectively . to search for optical counterparts to x5 and x7 , two _ hst _",
    "datasets have been analysed , the 8.3 d observations of gilliland et al .",
    "2000 ( go-8267 : july 3 1999 to july 11 1999 ) and the archival data of meylan obtained in three different epochs with @xmath7 2 year spacings ( go-5912 : october 25 1995 ; go-6467 : november 3 1997 ; go-7503 : october 28 1999 ) .",
    "the gilliland data provides exquisite @xmath8 and @xmath9 time series ( with some @xmath10 data ) and the meylan data provides f300w images in the first two epochs and f300w and f555w images in the third epoch ( with limited time series information in each epoch ) .      using the zeropoint positional offsets between the _ chandra _  and _ hst_coordinate frames , the region within @xmath720 of the nominal x5 position lies outside the fov of the gilliland data set , but is found on the inner part ( with respect to cluster center ) of the wf4 chip in the meylan data .",
    "since no _ chandra _  source in the wf4 fov with @xmath11 counts ( not including x5 ) currently has a plausible optical counterpart , we used the pc astrometry to align the x - ray and optical coordinate frames ( incurring a systematic chip - to - chip error , assumed to be 005 , which dominates the total error budget ) .",
    "after this correction we found that only three stars are within 05 of the nominal x5 position , with separations of 0033 ( 0.6@xmath6 ; c1 ) , 023 ( 4.5@xmath6 ; c2 ) and 0292 ( 5.7@xmath6 ; c3 ) .",
    "the finding chart shows the f300w ( fig . [ fig1]a ) and f555w ( fig . [ fig1]b ) images , from meylan epoch 3 , for the region around x5 and the insets in fig .",
    "1a show epochs 1 ( ` u(1 ) ' ) and 2 ( ` u(2 ) ' ) . since faint red ms stars appear brighter in the f555w image than in the f300w image , figures 1a and 1b show that c1 has a blue color .",
    "however , c3 ( just outside the 5@xmath6 error circle to the ne ) has an even stronger blue color and so is also a potentially viable optical counterpart if the astrometric shift between the pc and wf4 chips is much larger than assumed .",
    "this ambiguity is resolved by noting that c1 , unlike c3 , is clearly brighter in epoch 1 than in epoch 2 ( see inset ) confirming it as the optical counterpart ( hereafter @xmath12 ) .",
    "[ fig1 ]    the region within a few arcsec of x7 falls on the pc images of both the gilliland and meylan data sets . since 17",
    "_ chandra _  sources have likely optical counterparts on the gilliland pc image , we have corrected for small linear terms in the residual astrometric errors between _ chandra _  and _ hst _  using least squares fitting .",
    "we computed the positional errors for x7 by adding the systematic errors to the random wavdetect errors in quadrature , resulting in 1@xmath6 errors of 00065 in ra and 00088 in dec ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]c and [ fig1]d , where 20@xmath6 error circles are shown ) . the three nearest stars to x7 in the gilliland _ hst _  image are 0019 ( 2.3@xmath6 ) , 012 ( 14.7@xmath6 ) and 023 ( 28.6@xmath6 ) away ( n1 , n2 and n3 respectively ) . clearly , astrometrically , only n1 ( @xmath2 ; @xmath13 ; @xmath5",
    "= 6.8 ) is a viable candidate for the optical companion of x7 .",
    "given the fov of the pc and the detected number of stars on the pc chip with @xmath14 ( 6367 ) , only @xmath15 stars are expected within 0019 of n1 , assuming constant density over the pc fov .",
    "the gilliland dataset photometry ( containing only x7 ) is described in gilliland et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and albrow et al .",
    "the photometry for the meylan observations ( containing x5 and x7 ) was based on combining the images at each epoch using drizzle routines ( hook , pirzkal , & fruchter 1999 ) in stsdas and then using psf - fitting in daophot to calculate instrumental magnitudes .",
    "the f555w filter is a good approximation to johnson @xmath8 ( holtzman et al .",
    "1995 ) , but f300w differs significantly from the nearest johnson filter ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "therefore , we used ground - based photometry of 47 tuc ( sills et al .",
    "2000 ) and matching of main sequence ( ms ) turnoffs between the _ hst _  and ground - based datasets to calculate the zeropoint and then applied corrections to f300w-@xmath8 ( by measuring ms ridgelines ) to convert it to @xmath16 . by definition",
    "this ms - ridgeline technique is only applied to stars ( like @xmath12 ) with colors ranging from the main sequence turn - off to the detected end of the ms .",
    "[ fig2 ]    since this technique is non - standard we have performed two consistency checks with other calibration methods .",
    "we applied this technique to the meylan pc data and performed a star - by - star comparison between our photometry and the gilliland et al .",
    "( 2000 ) photometry .",
    "mean differences between the two photometric systems were @xmath17 mag in both @xmath10 and @xmath8 . a star - by - star comparison between the ms - ridgeline @xmath8 calibration for the meylan wf4 chip ( containing @xmath12 ) and the standard calibration of holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) applied to a 47 tuc f555w image from the archive ( program go-6095 ) , also gave mean errors < 0.05 mag .",
    "combined with the 0.1 mag rms internal error in @xmath16 at the @xmath10 mag of @xmath12 , we estimate absolute errors for @xmath12  of @xmath70.2 mag in both @xmath10 and @xmath8 .",
    "the color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for the gilliland pc and meylan wf4 images are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a shows the mean epoch 3 cmd position of @xmath12  ( @xmath0 ; @xmath1 ; @xmath5  = 8.2 ) , along with reasonable ranges in magnitude and color given the variability ( see below ) . with @xmath5@xmath18",
    ", @xmath12  has a similar absolute magnitude to that of the qlmxbs cen - x4 ( @xmath5@xmath19 ; chevalier et al .",
    "1989 ) and aql x-1 ( @xmath5@xmath20 ; chevalier et al .",
    "1999 ) . also shown",
    "are co and he wd cooling sequences ( see caption ) .",
    "clearly , @xmath12  is unlikely to be either a co wd or a he wd , unlike the msp companion @xmath21  ( egh01 ) .",
    "instead , it is more likely that the cmd position of @xmath12  represents the sum of a red ms star and a blue component from an accretion disk ( see below ) .",
    "[ fig3 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig2]b shows the gilliland cmd for x7 showing the position of the three nearest stars ( n1 , n2 and n3 ) .",
    "the only viable counterpart astrometrically , n1 , falls very close to the ms ridge line ( also in @xmath8 vs @xmath22 ) and therefore appears like a normal ms star ( unlike @xmath12 ) .",
    "this cmd position is consistent , within the errors , with the position in the meylan data , and the f300w magnitudes from the three epochs are consistent with non - variability , again unlike @xmath12 .",
    "this suggests that n1 is probably not the x7 counterpart , despite the good astrometric match . assuming that the real counterpart falls in the less confused part of a 5-@xmath6 error circle we set limits on its detection of @xmath23 23 , @xmath24 23 , @xmath25 22 ( using the gilliland data ) .",
    "since @xmath12  is near ( or beyond ) the limit of detectability in individual f300w exposures , the time series for @xmath12  were calculated by co - adding groups of 3 - 4 images .",
    "figures [ fig3]a , b and c show the f300w time series for the 3 different epochs .",
    "also shown are the eclipsed portion of the x - ray phase plot from hgl01 ( units converted into time ) and a 4.333 hour period sinusoid , as appropriate for x5 but with the 8.666 hour x - ray period divided by two to simulate a double - peaked ( ellipsoidal ) time series .",
    "eclipses are not included in this model .",
    "this model has been shifted in time and magnitude so that it plausibly matches the data for each epoch ( the period is not known with sufficient accuracy to phase correct from _ chandra _  to different _ hst _  epochs ) .",
    "significant variability is seen within all three epochs and @xmath12  is clearly brighter in epoch 1 than in the 2nd and 3rd epochs ( see fig [ fig1]a ) .",
    "this longterm variability is further evidence for the presence of an accretion disk .",
    "note the deep eclipse observed in both epochs 2 and 3 .",
    "the f300w eclipse appears to be significantly wider than in x - rays , though we do not observe the system coming out of eclipse .",
    "the turnover at the beginning of the second epoch ( near time@xmath26 hr ) may represent a minimum from ellipsoidal variability , since the timescale of variability agrees well with the ellipsoidal model .",
    "the 1st epoch observations may also represent ellipsoidal variations rather than an eclipse , since in its brighter state the relative brightness of the disk compared to the secondary should be enhanced and the eclipse depth should increase .",
    "the @xmath8-band variations , not plotted here , show neither an eclipse nor clear evidence for ellipsoidal variations ( expected to have a smaller amplitude than in f300w ) .",
    "no suggestion of variability is present in the n1 time series ( fig . [",
    "fig3]d ) and no significant signal is seen in the n1 power spectrum ( @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) , including the possible 5.5 hr period noted by hgl01 .",
    "the highest peak in the @xmath8-band corresponds to a period of 2.52 hours ( or twice this ) , with a false - alarm probability = 0.27 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath8 amplitude is 0.0043 @xmath27 0.0011 ( @xmath4 4-@xmath6 , insignificant for a blind search ;",
    "similar results hold for @xmath9 ) .",
    "if n1 _ is _ the x7 counterpart and is close to filling its roche lobe then an inclination @xmath28  is required to reduce the amplitude for ellipsoidal variations from the maximum expected value of @xmath70.1 , for 90  inclination , to @xmath29 .",
    "this implies that n1 is unlikely to be the x7 companion , and we have calculated the brightness limit for a faint variable star ( lying near the line of sight of n1 ) to be missed by our variability search .",
    "the x7 coordinates are so close to n1 that it will be included in any time series extraction .",
    "a star at @xmath30 with intrinsic variations of 0.1 mag superimposed on the time series of n1 would yield an 8-@xmath6 detection ( versus the highest detected peak at @xmath7 4-@xmath6 ) .",
    "this time series limit of @xmath31 for a companion to x7 will decrease for inclinations @xmath32 .",
    "using the stellar models of bergbusch & vandenberg ( 1992 ) , we estimated the brightest possible secondary consistent with our photometry ( @xmath33@xmath34k , @xmath0 and mass = 0.53m@xmath35 ) . using the secondary radius , the x - ray luminosity of x5 and the binary separation ( from kepler s third law ) we estimate that the maximum luminosity from heating of the secondary by the ns ( when measured as a fraction of the secondary luminosity ) is 2.7% . therefore",
    ", secondary heating probably makes only a small contribution to the variability described above .",
    "the dominant sources of short - term variability are likely to be a combination of eclipses of the disk and hot spot by the ms star , ellipsoidal variations and flickering .",
    "further observations are required to better define this variability .",
    "the likely presence of an accretion disk in @xmath12 , from variability and the blue color , may appear to be inconsistent with the lack of x - ray evidence for accretion currently in the x5 system , which should yield either long - term x - ray variations or a power law component , neither of which are seen ( hgl01 ) .",
    "one possible explanation is that the x5 secondary is no longer filling its roche lobe causing it to be detached from the disk .",
    "such a disk would no longer be accreting matter from the secondary , possibly causing it to enter a long - term quiescent phase with low density and little or no accretion onto the ns .",
    "the x5 disk does appear to be relatively faint compared to 47 tuc cvs , since the @xmath16 color of @xmath12  ( 0.9 ) is much redder than that of the 47 tuc cvs v1 , v2 , w1 and w2 with @xmath16 colors ranging from @xmath36 to @xmath37 ( edmonds et al .",
    "2001 , in preparation ) .    to test this",
    "` detached disk ' theory we have estimated the degree to which @xmath12  fills its roche - lobe as defined by @xmath38 , the ratio between the stellar radius and the roche lobe radius . using the roche - lobe formula from @xcite ( @xmath39^{1/3}}$ ] , where @xmath40 is the roche - lobe radius , @xmath41 is the binary separation , @xmath42 is the mass of @xmath12 , and @xmath43m@xmath35 ) , the stellar radius for a 4100 k model and the binary separation , we find that @xmath12  has @xmath44 , underfilling its roche lobe .",
    "fainter cooler secondaries will underfill their roche lobes by slightly larger amounts ( e.g. a star with @xmath5  = 10.0 has @xmath45 ) .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the ` detached disk ' theory given above , but would be inconsistent with the possible detection of ellipsoidal variations of relatively large amplitude , requiring the secondary to have @xmath461.0 . the latter possibility would suggest that the x5 secondary is either bloated or slightly evolved , as appears to be the case for some of the cvs in ngc 6397 ( grindlay et al .",
    "2001 , in preparation ) and as might be expected for a star undergoing mass loss .    if the 5.5 hr x - ray period for x7 ( hgl01 ) is real , and if the x7 secondary underfills its roche lobe by about the same amount as @xmath12 , then @xmath5@xmath47 and @xmath48 , beyond our variability detection limits and beyond our cmd search limit except with the presence of a reasonably bright disk .",
    "the close proximity of n1 only @xmath7002 from the line of sight of x7 , clearly makes prospects for such an optical identification difficult . alternatively , the period could be longer and n1 could be the counterpart , however the complete lack of evidence for a disk or variability rules against this possibility .",
    "the logical follow - up to these observations are spectroscopic studies to measure the radial velocity amplitude of absorption lines from @xmath12 .",
    "this , combined with the known inclination and spectroscopic and photometric determinations of @xmath42 would give an estimate of the mass of the x5 ns . using the x - ray spectrum constraints on the ns radius and redshift ( hgl01 ) combined with the ns mass",
    "would give the first compelling test of the equation of state of a ns . also of interest",
    "would be the detection of emission lines in the optical spectrum . since there is evidence for an accretion disk ( from this work ) and hot gas in the system ( from the x - ray light curve ) , we expect strong disk or coronal emission lines to be superimposed on the absorption line spectrum of the secondary .",
    "study of the emission line profiles can test for mass outflow ( visible as p cygni profiles ) from the system , or detect evidence for a bipolar jet ( visible as broadened emission lines ) .",
