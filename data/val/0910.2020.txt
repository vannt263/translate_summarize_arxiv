    "neutrino oscillations @xcite are now well - established .",
    "the relevant mass - squared differences and mixing angles have also been studied in various experiments @xcite ; the study of neutrino oscillation physics is now at the precision stage with many existing and proposed near - future experiments .",
    "a natural progression in the precision study is to probe oscillation physics with neutrino factory beams .    in a neutrino factory ,",
    "a @xmath1 or @xmath2 beam from a storage ring decays down a long straight section of the beam - line that points at a far - end detector .",
    "the decay of the muons produces a spectrum of electron and muon neutrinos via @xmath3 and @xmath4 , that is extremely well - understood .",
    "charged - current ( cc ) interactions of the muon anti - neutrinos ( neutrinos ) in the detector lead to the production of @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) leptons .",
    "the electron neutrinos ( anti - neutrinos ) , on the other hand , can _ oscillate _ into muon neutrinos ( anti - neutrinos ) which in cc interactions in the detector , produce @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) leptons , or muons with charge opposite to that from the unoscillated case and hence get detected as `` wrong sign '' ( ws ) muons .",
    "in general , the focus of studies @xcite with neutrino factories ( and the many papers and effort towards specifying the parameters of such a future neutrino factory ) has been to pin down the as - yet unknown neutrino oscillation parameters , in particular , the across - generation 13 mixing angle @xmath5 and the cp violating phase @xmath6 , in addition to other possibilities such as the mass hierarchy ( or mass ordering in the 23 sector ) and the octant of the 23 mixing angle @xmath7 ( whether it is larger or smaller than @xmath8 ) .",
    "all these can be best studied through measuring the ws events , as discussed above , in detectors capable of charge identification . the so - called right - sign ( rs ) ( having the same charge as unoscillated )",
    "muon events are useful for precision measurements of the leading atmospheric parameters @xmath7 and the atmospheric mass squared difference , @xmath9 , apart from their use in understanding cross - section and flux uncertainties . in particular , they are sensitive probes of whether @xmath0 mixing is maximal , when @xmath10 ; we shall refer to this value of @xmath7 as being maximal .",
    "such maximal mixing usually arises from an underlying symmetry @xcite that would dictate the structure of the neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "measurement of deviation from maximality is therefore of great significance in developing models for neutrino masses and mixings .    in this paper",
    ", we address the little - studied issue of contamination of the ( right or wrong sign ) muon events sample from oscillations of the muon or electron neutrinos or anti - neutrinos to tau neutrinos or anti - neutrinos , which , through cc interactions in the detector , result in tau leptons that subsequently decay to muons . while tau - production in neutrino - nucleus collisions has been studied in great detail , for example in ref .",
    "@xcite , there are not many studies on the implications of the tau contamination ( through leptonic decay ) of the cc muon or electron events .",
    "tau contributions naturally arise in multi - gev cc neutrino  nucleus interactions .",
    "although the tau cc events are kinematically suppressed due to the large tau mass , @xmath11 gev , the total contribution from taus is substantial since @xmath12 oscillations are large , being driven by a nearly maximal @xmath7 . here",
    "we focus on how this contribution affects a precision measurement of the deviation of @xmath12 mixing from maximal , i.e. , a precision measurement of @xmath7 and its deviation from maximal .",
    "tau contributions enhance both the rs and ws event rates in both the muon and electron sectors , since the leptonic tau decay fraction into both electrons and muons is about the same ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "in particular , we find that tau contributions substantially enhance the _ right - sign _ muon event rates , especially at small final lepton energies , _ independent of @xmath5_. however , due to a different parameter dependence , the tau contribution to muons _ worsens _ the determination of the deviation from maximality of @xmath7 while leaving the determination of @xmath14 unchanged .",
    "we also show that it is practically impossible to devise satisfactory cuts to remove this tau contamination .",
    "hence , studies ( beyond those discussed here ) at neutrino factories must first bring the relatively little - studied uncertainties due to tau production and decay under control in order to achieve the expected precision measurements with muon detection .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we briefly describe the physics of neutrino oscillations as is relevant for this study .",
    "we also list here the current limits on the oscillation parameters . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the inputs such as the neutrino fluxes and cross - sections and preferred base - lengths . while we use standard packages for the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) cross - sections involving muon neutrinos , we use the mass - corrected leading order ( lo ) expressions for the tau contributions as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , as well as comment on the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) contributions . in section 4 , we calculate numerically the event rates for various processes at an iron calorimeter detector capable of detecting muons with charge identification , such as the proposed ical / ino or the numerically mooted mind .",
    "the numerical computation involves the calculation of the neutrino factory fluxes , the probability amplitudes using a solver for the neutrino evolution equation , which has been described in ref .",
    "@xcite , calculation of the double differential cross section and in addition , the differential decay rate of the taus to muons , in case of the tau contribution .",
    "we conclude in section 5 .",
    "with a long baseline , the large matter effects in the course of neutrino propagation help in improved sensitivity to many parameters . in general , the 3-flavor probabilities , @xmath15 , of flavor @xmath16 oscillating into flavor @xmath17 , depend on all the oscillation parameters ( in vacuum ) : the mixing angles @xmath18 , the cp violating phase , @xmath6 and the mass - squared differences @xmath19 , as well as the density of earth s matter .",

    "squared difference we use the notation @xcite @xmath22 , so that a normal or inverted hierarchy is simply indicated by a sign ( and not magnitude ) change in this parameter .",
    "we use a runge - kutta solver to calculate the oscillation probabilities for various energies and path lengths .",
    "some technical details are given in ref .",
    "all numerical results presented in this paper have been obtained using the density profile of the earth as given by the preliminary reference earth model ( prem ) @xcite and numerically evolving the flavor eigenstates through earth s matter . in particular , the approximate expressions for the probabilities as shown in eq .",

    "we assume that the muons are reconstructed with a gaussian resolution width of 7% ( @xmath39 ) for energetic , gev muons .",

    "hence , @xmath1 beams are preferred for studying ws events ( where charge identification is crucial ) which are sensitive to non - zero @xmath5 , 23 mass hierarchy , octant of @xmath7 and the cp phase @xmath48 , away from the magic baseline",
    ". a @xmath2 beam with larger rs events would be desirable for precision of @xmath49 and @xmath7 .",
    "however , using the full sample without charge identification is preferable , as the detection efficiency of the charge blind sample would be higher",
    ". since the ws events are a small fraction of the large rs sample , using the sum does not worsen the precision of the parameters .",
    "we therefore add the events ( rs+ws ) from both @xmath2 and @xmath1 beams ; the total event rate is also shown in the figure .",

    "the left lower panel shows the sum @xmath51 . notice that there is a substantial contribution from tau decay to rs events , as seen in the right lower panel ; also , the ws events have a negligible contribution to the total event rate .",
    "oscillation parameters are as shown , with @xmath52 in ev@xmath42 and other oscillation parameters as given in table  [ tab : bestfit ] .",
    "]    it can be seen that there is a substantial contribution to the rs events from tau decay into muons .",
    "since the tau life - time is very short , these events will add to the observed rs events from direct muon production in @xmath53nucleon interactions . since the tau contribution alters the sensitivity to the oscillation parameters as discussed in section  [ sec : tau ] and illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : theta23 ] , we next discuss whether these events can be removed through various cuts on the final charged lepton energy or production angle .      as stated earlier , tau production in neutrino ",

    "[ fig : emx ] .",
    "furthermore , the muons produced in leptonic tau decay are also forward peaked ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : taudecay ] .",
    "hence , one obvious way to remove / reduce the tau contribution is an angular cut .",
    "also , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : taudecay ] , the tau decay rate is large for muons produced with low energies , resulting in a substantial tau contribution to the muon events , at small observed muon energies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] ) .",

    "the effect of cuts on the event rates is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cuts ] .",
    "the panels show the effect of an increasingly drastic angular cut on the final state muons .",
    "it can be seen that the only cut effective in removing / reducing the tau contribution is one ( with @xmath54 ) that removes the signal itself !",
    "alternately a muon energy cut , of about @xmath5515 gev , can substantially remove the tau contribution , still leaving sufficient direct muons .",
    "however , such a large energy cut will will worsen the precision to which the mixing parameters can be measured as sensitivity is higher in the lower energy bins where matter effects are larger . in short , it is not feasible to cut out the tau contribution and still make a precision measurement , in this case , of the deviation of @xmath7 from maximality .",
    "as stated earlier , the tau contribution alters the dependence on the mixing parameters , and thus alters the precision to which we can determine them .",
    "[ fig : theta23 ] shows the dependence of the direct and tau - induced muon events on @xmath7 . while the tau events have less sensitivity to this parameter , the rate increases while the direct event rate decreases as @xmath7 increases towards maximal @xmath56 .",
    "however , the inclusion of muons from tau events alters the uncertainties considerably .    .",
    "while increase in @xmath7 decreases the direct muon events , those coming from production and decay of taus tend to increase marginally with larger @xmath7 . the conflicting behavior results in less sensitivity in the total events .",
    "]    a look back at the expressions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rate ] ) clearly shows a major difference between direct and total ( including tau contribution ) muon production that is most easily appreciated by explicitly writing out the dominant rs contribution in each case : @xmath57 a near detector ( where the oscillation probabilities are near zero and the survival probabilities are nearly 1 ) , sensitive to muons , precisely measures the combination @xmath58 , that is , flux times cross - section of the muons .",
    "this is what appears in the ( rs ) event rate for direct muon production and is therefore very well constrained from measurements at the near detector .",
    "indeed , uncertainties are reduced to a factor of @xmath59 , mainly arising from differences in the shape of the flux at the near- and far - detectors .    however , what appears in the ( rs ) event rate expression via tau production and decay is the combination @xmath60 .",
    "while the flux is the same as for direct muon production and in fact very well understood , the same is not true of the cross - section .",
    "while the muon cross - sections have large uncertainties inherent in any perturbative qcd calculation at low / medium @xmath61 , these are compounded for the case of the heavy tau where mass corrections are large .",
    "furthermore , since these contributions result from oscillations , no near detector can help reduce the uncertainties more .",
    "hence overall uncertainties are much larger for the tau contribution than for direct muons and this exacerbates the problem of precision measurements with tau contamination .",
    "we now proceed to show this effect through specific numerical calculations .",
    "we use a combined overall normalization error of 0.1% for direct muon events ( separate flux and cross - section normalization errors are not required as for ws studies since the rs events are by far the dominant contribution and errors are kept well in check by studies at the near detector as described above ) .",
    "we use a modest normalization error of 2% for the total ( direct+tau ) events ; since the same ( muon neutrino ) flux contributes , this is essentially the error on the ratio of the tau to muon cross - sections .",
    "we use typical input values of ( @xmath62 ) to estimate how well the generated `` data '' can be fitted , and calculate the resulting precision on the parameters .",
    "again , we keep the solar parameters fixed at their best - fit values and set @xmath6 to zero .",
    "the best fits ( and regions of confidence levels in parameter space ) are obtained by minimizing the chi - squared according to the method of `` pulls '' @xcite : @xmath63~.   \\label{eq : chi2}\\ ] ] here the normalization uncertainty for the event rate in a bin is parameterized as a linear function of the pull : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is either 0.1 or 2% for direct and total respectively and @xmath66 is the pull that accounts for the overall systematic error on the rate . while the expression can be minimized over a set of pulls for each systematic error , this is not needed since the rate is dominated by the rs events as explained earlier . here the theoretical rates in a bin correspond to a central value of @xmath67 with @xmath68 representing @xmath69 errors .",
    "we follow the prescription of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the chi - squared is first minimized over @xmath66 and then minimized with respect to oscillation parameters to get the best - fit values and regions .",
    "we present results for a typical sample set of input parameters , ( @xmath70 ev@xmath42 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) . after minimizing over the pull",
    ", we minimize over @xmath9 and @xmath7 , keeping the 13 mixing angle fixed .",

    "@xmath7 space at 99% cl from cc events directly producing muons ( solid line ) and with the inclusion of muons from tau decay as well ( dashed line ) for input parameter values of ( @xmath70 ev@xmath42 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) . ]",
    "note that the selected signal ( all muons in the final state , independent of charge ) is dominated by rs muons and is therefore insensitive to the _ octant _ of @xmath7 as well as the _ sign _ of @xmath9 ( or the mass hierarchy ) .",
    "these can be probed only through a study of ws muons , as has been discussed elsewhere .",
    "returning to the issue of deviation of @xmath7 from maximality , it can be seen that the 99% cl contour is much more constrained with direct muons than for total muons , including those from tau decay . in particular , it is the @xmath9 values that are smaller than the input ( true ) value , that broaden the contour and limit the discrimination .",
    "hence the effect of adding in the tau contribution is a worsening in the precision with which @xmath7 and its deviation from maximality can be measured : a spread of @xmath75 if tau events are removed and @xmath76 when they are included .",
    "this occurs because of the conflicting dependence on @xmath7 of the two contributions , as has been discussed earlier .",
    "however , it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : contt13fix ] that the inclusion of the tau events does not affect the determination of ( the modulus of ) @xmath73 which is tightly constrained to better than @xmath77 in either case .",

    "due to the extraordinarily large rs signal , it is anticipated that some of the early measurements at a neutrino factory will be those of precision determination of @xmath9 and @xmath7 and the deviation of the latter from maximality .",
    "certainly a strong case for conventional neutrino factories of the type considered here will be made only when @xmath5 is small , below the reach of near - future super - beams or reactor searches .",
    "hence we expect @xmath5 to be relatively unknown at the time of such measurements , typically restricted to a value @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath5 will worsen the allowed parameter space from both direct and total muon events .",
    "in particular , the dependence of the event rates ( both direct and tau - induced ) is such that values of @xmath5 larger than the true value lower the @xmath82 near maximal @xmath7 , and hence worsen the power of discriminating against it . in other words ,",
