    "the absolute - magnitude distributions of the various supernova ( sn ) types provide vital information for determining sn rates , for advancing our knowledge of the stellar progenitors and their explosion mechanisms , and for planning future ground- and space - based sn searches .",
    "more than a decade ago , ( mb90 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) used the asiago supernova catalog ( the asc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to carry out a comparative study of absolute - magnitude distributions . at the end of 1989 , the asc listed only 687 sne , and many of those were of unknown type . by june , 2001",
    "( updates are available at ` http://merlino.pd.astro.it/~supern/ ` ) , the number of events in the asc had increased to 1910 .",
    "almost all of the sne of the 1990 s had been assigned types , and some of the pre-1990 data had been improved .",
    "we therefore decided that an updated study of the absolute - magnitude distributions would be timely .",
    "it should be acknowledged that the characteristic uncertainty of the apparent magnitudes listed in the asc , perhaps 0.2 or 0.3 mag , is not negligible for this purpose .",
    "thanks to the tremendous interest in using sne  ia as distance indicators for cosmology , studies of the sn  ia absolute - magnitude distribution now can be based on carefully selected samples of events for which both the apparent magnitudes and the relative distances are known to high accuracy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the absolute - magnitude scatter in these samples can be further reduced in two ways .",
    "first , the host galaxy extinction can be taken into account for each sn using the sn s @xmath12 color .",
    "next , the fact that some sne  ia are intrinsically dimmer than others can be accounted for by using a correction to the light - curve width such as the @xmath13 parameter @xcite or the method of multicolor light - curve shapes ( mlcs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with these corrections the dispersion in @xmath14 for sne",
    "ia can be reduced to 0.11 @xcite , making them extremely useful as distance indicators for cosmology .",
    "our present study , which has little to add to our knowledge of the sn  ia absolute - magnitude distribution , is directed more at the absolute - magnitude distributions of the other sn types .",
    "as far as the other sn types are concerned , either the number of events for which accurate peak apparent magnitudes have been reported remains small ( sne  ib , ic , ii - l , iin ) or the intrinsic dispersion in the peak absolute magnitude is large ( sne  ii - p ) .",
    "for these types a study such as this one , based on all available data , can be useful .",
    "for comparison with the other types , sne  ia are included as well .",
    "most of the sn types and apparent magnitudes are taken from the asc ( as of june , 2001 ) .",
    "several changes in the spectral types are made after examining spectra available to us .",
    "some additional data ( mostly for recent sne  ia ) are included from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "magnitudes from perlmutter et al .  include k - corrections .",
    "several changes in the apparent magnitudes are made after examining the atlas of light curves of sne  i by @xcite .",
    "where possible we use blue magnitudes .",
    "photographic magnitudes are converted to blue magnitudes using the usual relation @xmath15 .",
    "when necessary we assume that @xmath16 ( except for the k - corrected events ) .",
    "the apparent magnitudes are corrected for galactic extinction following @xcite with the help of ned .",
    "when possible , we use a cepheid distance to the parent galaxy or to a member of the same galaxy group as the parent galaxy .",
    "the cepheid distances are obtained from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "if a cepheid distance is not available we use distances from the nearby galaxies catalog ( ngc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which incorporates a virgocentric infall model to relate galaxy recession velocity and distance .",
    "the errors in the relative distances to these events contribute significantly to the absolute - magnitude scatter in our figures .",
    "we rescale the distances from the @xmath17 km  s@xmath18  mpc@xmath18 of the ngc to our choice of @xmath19 .",
    "if a cepheid distance or an ngc distance is not available then the luminosity distance is calculated @xcite , provided that the sn parent galaxy has a galactocentric recession velocity of @xmath20 km  s@xmath18 .",
    "the luminosity distance is calculated assuming @xmath19 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "errors in the relative distances to these events should be small .",
    "a different choice of @xmath23 would simply rescale the absolute magnitudes .",
    "different choices of @xmath24 or @xmath25 would change our plots only slightly ( at large distances ) .",
    "a few sne whose parent galaxies have @xmath26 km s@xmath18 but do not have a measured cepheid distance and are not listed in the ngc are excluded from the study .",
    "the large magellanic cloud , the site of sn  1987a , is assigned a distance modulus of 18.50 .",
    "in figure  1 , absolute magnitude is plotted against distance modulus for all 297 sne for which we have an estimate of the apparent magnitude at the time of maximum light ; we will refer to these as _ maximum - light _",
    "sne . also shown , at the left side of figure  1 ,",
    "are estimates by @xcite of the absolute magnitudes of six galactic sne of the last millennium that occurred within about 4  kpc of the earth .",
    "schaefer s estimates actually are of @xmath27 , rather than @xmath14 , and his estimates of the distance moduli of these events range from 11.4 to 12.7 , off - scale to the left of figure  1 .",
    "figure  2 is like figure  1 , but for the 1078 sne for which we have only lower limits to the peak absolute brightness because the apparent magnitude at the time of maximum light is unknown ; we will refer to these as _ limit _ sne .",
    "both figures contain some straight lines to guide the eye .",
    "the horizontal line at @xmath28 is regarded as characteristic of normal sne  ia and we will refer to this as the sn  ia _ ridge line_. the horizontal line at @xmath29 and the vertical lines at @xmath30 and @xmath31 will be referred to below .",
    "the slanted lines correspond to apparent magnitudes of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "figure  1 shows that so far most of the maximum - light sne have had peak apparent magnitudes brighter than @xmath32 , while figure  2 shows that most of the limit sne were fainter than @xmath32 at their brightest observation .",
    "an indication of the dramatic observational progress that has taken place during the 1990s is that mb90 also plotted the @xmath32 line , and only _ four _ maximum - light sne were to the right of it .",
    "mb90 did not consider the limit sne .    when viewing figures  1 and 2 it is helpful to think in terms of several different distance regimes .",
    "first come the galactic sne , then sn  1987a and sn  1885a in the local group .",
    "next come sne in `` nearby galaxies '' , say within 10 mpc ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the interval from @xmath35 to @xmath36 ( @xmath37 kms@xmath18 , 100  mpc ) includes many sne of the local supercluster , with those of the virgo cluster being concentrated near @xmath38 . from @xmath36 ( or less ) to @xmath39 ( @xmath40 km s@xmath18 , @xmath41 ) is the `` hubble flow '' , where luminosity distance depends on @xmath23 but only slightly on @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "as will be seen below , most of the maximum - light events in the hubble flow are sne  ia ; this is due to the observational bias in favor of luminous events . beyond @xmath39 is the realm of the `` high - redshift '' sne where , fortunately for cosmology , the luminosity distance depends significantly on @xmath24 and @xmath25 . here",
    "too , most of the events are sne  ia . at present",
    "most of the high - redshift events appear in figure  2 , as limit sne , but some of these will become maximum - light sne when their peak apparent magnitudes are eventually reported .",
    "sn  1987a stimulated interest in subluminous sne , e.g. , those having @xmath42 .",
    "the severe observational bias against them is obvious from figures  1 and 2 . beyond @xmath35 , _ none _ of the maximum - light sne",
    "are dimmer than @xmath29 .",
    "@xcite considered two small volume - limited samples of sne and concluded that a substantial fraction of all sne are subluminous .",
    "one of his samples consisted of the six galactic sne that are represented in figure  1 .",
    "two of the six are estimated to have been even less luminous than sn  1987a . adopting these estimates",
    ", @xcite carried out a monte carlo simulation of the visibility of galactic sne and concluded that it is quite likely that a significant fraction of the sne in the galaxy are `` ultra - dim '' ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "schaefer s other volume - limited sample consisted of sne in nearby galaxies .",
    "in addition to sn  1987a there are four events in figure  1 that have @xmath44 .",
    "sn  1940e ( of unknown type ) appeared in the dusty , nearly edge - on galaxy ngc  253 and probably was heavily extinguished so it may not have been intrinsically subluminous @xcite .",
    "sne  1923a and 1945b , both in the nearly face - on galaxy m83 , do not appear to have been heavily extinguished @xcite .",
    "sn  1973r , in ngc  3727 , was observed to be quite blue @xcite and therefore also is unlikely to have been heavily extinguished .",
    "it is likely that sne  1923a ( classified",
    "ii - p only on the basis of its light curve ) , 1945b ( unknown type ) , and 1973r ( type",
    "ii - p ) were intrinsically subluminous .    in figure  1 , among the galactic sne and the sne in nearby galaxies having @xmath45 , seven of the 31 events",
    "are estimated to have had @xmath46 .",
    "even this sample is by no means free of bias against subluminous events , so it appears that the fraction of all sne that are subluminous is more than ( possibly much more than ) one fifth .",
    "but because the number of such events that have been seen is still so small , this fraction remains very uncertain .",
    "the data on maximum - light sne that were available to mb90 showed no convincing evidence for events that were significantly overluminous with respect to the sn  ia ridge line , but by now it has become clear that overluminous events do exist , outstanding examples being the type iin sn  1997cy @xcite at @xmath47 and the peculiar type ic sn  1999as @xcite at @xmath48 .    in figure  1 , the two brightest sne are well above the sn  ia ridge line , but the apparent magnitudes ( and the types ) of both are uncertain . the light curves of sne  1955b ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and 1968a ( mainly * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are plotted and compared to a template light curve for sne  ia by @xcite . whether or not these two events were overluminous depends on the accuracy of the photographic photometry .",
    "it is not clear that either of these events were genuinely overluminous .    the peak apparent magnitudes for sn  1920a and sn  1963s given in the asc would lead to @xmath49 for both .",
    "however , the peak magnitudes were obtained by extrapolating well beyond the observations using the sn  ia template light curve @xcite .",
    "since both events are of unknown type , we treat them as limit sne and use the observations without extrapolation to estimate the brightest apparent magnitudes . for sn",
    "1920a we use @xmath50 ( b. e. schaefer 1999 , private communication ) and obtain @xmath51 , still overluminous .",
    "for sn  1963s we use @xmath52 @xcite and obtain @xmath53 , also overluminous .    in figure  2 ,",
    "quite a few of the limit sne have @xmath1 , but undoubtedly this is mainly because limit sne were not as well observed as maximum - light sne , so their magnitude errors tend to be larger .",
    "in particular , many of the apparent magnitudes of the high - redshift limit sne are just first estimates that were made at the time of discovery ; if and when more accurate apparent magnitudes are reported after the parent - galaxy light has been subtracted , most of them will come down to the sn  ia ridge line ( because most of them are sne  ia ) . the apparent magnitudes of nine of the most extreme cases in figure  2 , those that have @xmath54  sn  1999bd and 1961j ( type  ii ) ; 1988o ( type  ia or ic ; see  4.1 ) ; 1984 m ( unknown type ) ; 1995av and 2000ei ( probable type ii ) ; 2000eh and 1999fo ( type  ia ) ; and sn  1971r ( unknown type )  are the preliminary estimates reported in the iau circulars .",
    "we can not be sure that any of these events really were overluminous , but it would take large magnitude errors to get them below @xmath55 .    at least two events in figure  2 , 1997cy and 1999as , were genuinely overluminous .",
    "most of the others that appear to be overluminous in figures  1 and 2 probably are spurious . in figure  1 ,",
    "the fraction of the maximum - light events that have @xmath56 is 0.067 ( 20 of 297 ) . in figure  2 ,",
    "the fraction is 0.101 ( 109 of 1078 ) . in view of the luminosity bias and the tendency of apparent - magnitude errors to make ridge - line events appear to be overluminous ,",
    "even the 0.067 is a generous upper limit to the true fraction of overluminous sne .",
    "the true fraction probably is much lower than 0.01 .",
    "for the absolute - magnitude distributions we will consider only sne that have @xmath57 ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 km s@xmath18 ) .",
    "this restriction is imposed because as figure  1 shows , beyond @xmath60 the luminosity bias is so severe that few events are much below the sn  ia ridge line .",
    "we need to keep in mind that even the distance - limited sample is strongly affected by luminosity bias  but to the extent that the bias is independent of the sn type , we can obtain some useful comparative results .",
    "histograms that appear in the following figures refer to absolute magnitudes that have been corrected only for galactic extinction , not for extinction in the parent galaxy .",
    "in addition to considering the distributions of such uncorrected absolute magnitudes , we will also consider `` intrinsic '' distributions , obtained as follows .",
    "@xcite used a monte carlo technique and a simple model of the spatial distributions of sne and dust in a characteristic sn - producing galaxy to calculate extinction distributions for each sn type , averaged over all galaxy inclinations . here , for each sn type , we assume for simplicity a gaussian intrinsic absolute - magnitude distribution , convolve it with the appropriate extinction distribution from hatano et al . , and vary the mean absolute magnitude and dispersion of the intrinsic distribution to obtain the best fit to the uncorrected distribution , as determined by the kolmogorov - smirnoff ( k - s ) test @xcite .",
    "because very few highly extinguished sne make it into observational samples , we use the `` extinction - limited subsets '' of hatano et al . , which exclude extinctions larger than @xmath61 mag .",
    "( changing this value by @xmath62 mag has very little effect on our results . )",
    "this simple statistical procedure makes a rough allowance for the effects of extinction on the absolute - magnitude distributions .",
    "sne  ia are plotted in figure  3 . here ,",
    "because of the relatively large amount of data available , sne  ia whose apparent magnitudes were designated as uncertain in the asc are treated as limit sne .",
    "( for the other types discussed below , the number of events is smaller and/or the absolute - magnitude dispersion is large , so we accept those having uncertain apparent magnitudes as maximum - light sne . )    in figure  3 , the maximum light sne  ia do show a fairly high degree of concentration to the ridge line at @xmath28 , as expected .",
    "the scatter among the maximum - light events is due to a combination of intrinsically subluminous sne  1991bg - like events , extinction in the parent galaxies , and errors in the apparent magnitudes and relative distances .",
    "some of the most extreme sn  ia are labeled in figure  3 . as mentioned above , the apparent magnitude of the very bright limit events sn  1988o , 1999fo and 2000eh are uncertain .",
    "also , although 1988o is listed as a type  ia in the asc , from the published spectra @xcite it is hard to exclude type  ic .",
    "the five low  luminosity events that are labeled in figure  3 include sne 1991bg and 1957a , both of which are known to have been spectroscopically peculiar and intrinsically subluminous .",
    "sn  1986 g is known to have been both spectroscopically peculiar and highly extinguished by dust in its parent galaxy .",
    "sne  1996ai @xcite and 1999cl @xcite are thought to have been highly extinguished in their parent galaxies .",
    "the histogram in figure  4 shows the uncorrected @xmath63 distribution for the 111 spectroscopically normal maximum  light sne  ia that have @xmath64 .",
    "( if the spectroscopically low - luminosity events were included the distribution could not be represented by a gaussian . )",
    "note that the distribution falls off steeply on the bright side , as expected if sne  ia are thermonuclear disruptions of chandrasekhar - mass white dwarfs ( or mergers of two white dwarfs ) because type ia light curves are powered by the radioactive decay of @xmath65ni and its daughter @xmath65co and there is a hard upper limit to the amount of @xmath65ni that one ( or two ) exploding white dwarfs can eject .",
    "( this is a reason to suspect that sn  1988o was a type  ic rather than a type  ia . )",
    "the uncorrected distribution has a mean absolute magnitude of @xmath66 , with a dispersion about the mean of @xmath67 .",
    "the solid curve , the gaussian intrinsic distribution obtained as described above , has @xmath68 .",
    "the extinction correction has made the mean absolute magnitude brighter by 0.3 mag .",
    ", and produced a moderate reduction in the dispersion .",
    "the dashed curve is the convolution of the intrinsic distribution with the adopted extinction distribution ; this is to be compared with the uncorrected distribution of the histogram . the k - s confidence level that the convolved distribution is consistent with the uncorrected distribution is 89% .",
    "figures  5 and 6 are like figures  3 and 4 , but for sne  ibc ( sne  ib and ic considered together because of the small amount of data available ) . in figure  5 , five maximum light sne  ibc are significantly brighter than the others . the peculiar type  ic sn  1998bw , well known for its possible connection to grb980425 , and the type  ib sn  1954a are well observed .",
    "the peculiar type ib sn  1991d is listed as a limit in the asc , but we have changed it to a maximum - light sn ( s. benetti et al . , in preparation ) . for the type  ib sn  1992ar we have used the average of two apparent magnitudes estimated by @xcite using two different template light curves for sne  ic .",
    "the apparent magnitude of the type  ic sn  1999cq is from @xcite .    the extremely bright limit event sn  1999as was discussed above .",
    "the apparent magnitudes of the other other bright limits , sne  1999bz and 1993p ( both type  ic ) , are uncertain .    the uncorrected distribution of the 18 maximum - light sne  ibc has @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and the intrinsic distribution has @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "the k - s confidence level is 96% but the test tends to give overly high confidence levels when the sample size is small .",
    "figure  5 raises the suspicion that there may be two separate luminosity groups of sne  ibc , one perhaps tightly clustered near @xmath73 and another with a wider range at @xmath74 .",
    "we will refer to these two groups as _ bright _ and _ normal_. because of this we have decided to consider a double peak distribution as well as the single peak distribution .",
    "the double peak distribution is given by : @xmath75 + \\exp\\biggl[-\\frac{(x - x_2)^2}{2\\sigma_{2}^{2}}\\biggr]\\biggr).\\ ] ] here , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the mean absolute magnitude and dispersion , respectively , for the bright peak .",
    "the dim peak is similarly determined by @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the fifth parameter is the weighting factor , @xmath80 .",
    "( @xmath81 is the normalization constant . )",
    "all five of these parameters are varied to get the best fit .",
    "figure  7 is like figure  6 but for a double peak distribution consisting of 5 bright and 13 normal sne  ibc . for the normal group , the uncorrected distribution",
    "has @xmath82 , @xmath83 and the intrinsic distribution has @xmath84 , @xmath85 . for the bright group ,",
    "the uncorrected distribution has @xmath86 , @xmath87 and the intrinsic distribution has @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "the weight parameter for the intrinsic distribution is @xmath90",
    ". the k - s confidence level approaches unity for these small samples .",
    "the hydrogen - poor progenitors of sne  ibc have small radii so the light curves of sne  ibc are powered by the radioactive decay of @xmath65ni . since the rise times to maximum light of sne  ibc and sne",
    "ia are similar , the ratio of the ejected masses of @xmath65ni in sne  ia and sne  ibc is approximately given by the ratio of their peak luminosities .",
    "using @xmath91 for sne  ia and @xmath92 for sne  ibc would give a ratio of nickel masses of 3.70 , e.g. , if the characteristic nickel mass of sne  ia is 0.6 @xmath93 then that of sne  ibc would be 0.16 @xmath93 .",
    "however , sne  ibc are redder than sne  ia at maximum light and a smaller proportion of their luminosity goes into the b band ( cf .",
    "mb90 ) , therefore the 0.16 @xmath93 may be an underestimate of the average value . the nickel mass determined from the tail of the light curve for sn  1994i was 0.07 @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "nickel masses for sne  ibc may be strongly dependent on the nature of the progenitor .      sne",
    "ii - l are shown in figures  8 and 9 .",
    "for the whole sample of 16 maximum - light sne  ii - l the uncorrected distribution has @xmath94 , @xmath95 and the intrinsic distribution has @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "the k - s confidence level is 91% .",
    "all four of the bright sne  ii - l  sne  1961f , 1979c , 1980k , and 1985l  were well observed .",
    "as has been discussed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite the available data suggest that it may be appropriate to divide sne  ii - l into two luminosity groups ; which , again , we refer to as bright and normal . when we do this , with only 4 events in the bright group and 12 in the normal group , we obtain figure  10 . for the normal group , the uncorrected distribution",
    "has @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and the intrinsic distribution has @xmath100 , @xmath101 . for the bright group ,",
    "the uncorrected distribution has @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and the intrinsic distribution has @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "the weight parameter for the intrinsic distribution is @xmath106 . for these small samples the confidence level , again , approaches unity .",
    "if , as is commonly assumed , the progenitors of sne  ii - l are red supergiants that have lost much but not nearly all of their hydrogen envelopes , then the peak luminosities of sne  ii - l depend primarily on the radius of the progenitor star and in some cases perhaps also on the strength of the circumstellar interaction , but not on the amount of ejected @xmath65ni . if this is correct , then the similarity of the luminosities of the bright group of sne  ii - l and the luminosities of normal sne  ia ( @xmath104 and @xmath3 respectively ) , as well as the similarities of the bright and normal sne  ii - l with the two possible groups of sne  ibc , must be coincidental .",
    "sne  ii - p are shown in figures  11 and 12 .",
    "the uncorrected distribution of the 29 maximum - light sne  ii - p has @xmath107 , @xmath108 . the intrinsic distribution has @xmath109 , @xmath110 with a k - s confidence level approaching unity .",
    "the progenitors of sne  ii - p are red supergiants that have retained large hydrogen masses .",
    "the large dispersion in the luminosities of sne  ii - p is primarily due to a wide range in the radii of the progenitor stars @xcite .",
    "figures  13 and 14 show sne  iin .",
    "the brightest maximum - light event , sn  1983k , is listed as a type  ii - p in the asc but we have treated it as a type  iin in view of the narrow lines in its spectra @xcite . none of the maximum - light sne  iin are extremely bright or dim .",
    "however , among the limit sne there are four that are brighter than @xmath111 .",
    "sn  1997cy , discussed above , was genuinely overluminous , while the apparent magnitudes of the other three ( sne  1990s , 1995aa and 1999z ) are uncertain .",
    "the uncorrected distribution of the 8 maximum - light sne  iin has @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and the intrinsic distribution has @xmath114 , @xmath113 . the k - s confidence level approaches unity .",
    "sne  iin are on average more luminous than other sne  ii because of circumstellar interaction .",
    "at least 7 of 31 sne in our galaxy and in galaxies within 10 mpc appear to have been subluminous ( @xmath115 ) . considering that even in this sample there is an observational bias against them",
    ", it appears that more ( perhaps much more ) than one fifth of all sne are subluminous , but because the number of such events seen so far is small , this fraction remains very uncertain .",
    "only 20 of 297 extragalactic maximum - light sne appear to be overluminous ( @xmath116 ) . considering the strong observational bias in favor of them , and that observational errors produce spuriously overluminous events , it is safe to conclude that the fraction of all sne that are overluminous must be much lower than 0.01 .",
    "the results of our comparative study of the absolute - magnitude distributions of sne in the distance - limited sample ( @xmath57 ) are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the main differences between our results and those of mb90 are that ( 1 ) it has become clear that overluminous sne ( @xmath56 ) exist ; ( 2 ) the absolute - magnitude dispersion of sne  ibc has increased due to the discovery of some rather luminous events ; and ( 3 ) we present results for sne  iin , which on average are the most luminous type of core ",
    "collapse sne .    even though the sn discovery rate increased dramatically in the 1990 s , the numbers of subluminous events , overluminous events , sne  ii - l , sne  ibc , and sne  iin for which apparent magnitudes at maximum light are available are still small",
    " this is especially so if sne  ii - l and ibc should be divided into two luminosity groups .",
    "except for sne  ia and ii - p , the study of sn absolute - magnitude distributions remains data starved .",

    "<S> an overview of the absolute magnitudes of the supernovae in the current observational sample is presented , and the evidence for subluminous and overluminous events is examined . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of supernovae that are underluminous ( @xmath0 ) appears to be higher ( perhaps much higher ) than one fifth but it remains very uncertain . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction that are overluminous ( @xmath1 ) is lower ( probably much lower ) than 0.01 . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute - magnitude distributions for each supernova type , restricted to events within 1 gpc , are compared . </S>",
    "<S> although these distributions are affected by observational bias in favor of the more luminous events , they are useful for comparative studies . </S>",
    "<S> we find mean absolute blue magnitudes ( for @xmath2 ) of @xmath3 for normal type  ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) , @xmath4 for sne  ibc , @xmath5 and @xmath6 for normal and bright sne  ibc considered separately , @xmath7 for sne  ii - l , @xmath8 and @xmath9 for normal and bright sne  ii - l considered separately , @xmath10 for sne  ii - p , and @xmath11 for sne  iin . </S>"
