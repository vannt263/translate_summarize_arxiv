    "the o(3 ) sigma model in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions is a popular model in theoretical physics and has been studied extensively @xcite@xcite . as far as static solutions are concerened",
    ", the model is integrable and of bogomolnyi type @xcite .",
    "the exact solutions are therefore available via simple analytical expressions . in contrast ,",
    "similar models in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) , are neither integrable nor of bogomolnyi type . nevertheless , the soliton solutions of models in 3 + 1 dimensions are extensively studied numerically and have found application in particle and nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "soliton solutions in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions , modified by the addition of the hopf term are topologically stable and are classified according to the homotopy @xmath0 .",
    "these solutions are scale - invariant .",
    "this property leads to some difficulties upon quantization .",
    "moreover , upon interacting with each other , solitons undergo change of size and tend to become singular @xcite .",
    "the soliton solutions of the o(3 ) sigma model with a suitable choice of potential are presented explicitly in @xcite together with their interaction behavior .",
    "these solitons are also called q - lumps .",
    "there are two natural ways for breaking the scale - invariance : gauging the symmetry , and including a potential term @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that gauging the u(1 ) subgroup by a chern - simons term and including a suitable potential leads to both topological and nontopological solitons which are not scale - invariant @xcite .",
    "the potential discussed in @xcite has two discrete minima @xmath1 for which the u(1 ) symmetry is not spontaneously broken in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "this model was further studied by mukherjee @xcite , where it was shown that the degeneracy of topological solitons is removed by including a potential with symmetry - breaking minima .",
    "solutions with azimuthal vector potentials ( @xmath2 ) , have quantized magnetic flux ( @xmath3 ) , spin ( @xmath4 ) , and charge ( @xmath5 ) .    in the present paper",
    ", we will show that within the framework of the model presented in @xcite , exact soliton solutions exist which depend on one spatial dimension , resembling domain - wall solutions of the @xmath6 theory . because of the non - trivial mapping between the boundaries and the discrete vacua , the solutions are topologically stable .",
    "the stability and lack of the scale invariance are also verified using the energy functional of the system .",
    "the lagrangian of the model considered here , is the one partially studied in @xcite , in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions : @xmath7 here @xmath8 is a triplet of scalar fields , constrained to a @xmath9 : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( a=1,2,3 ) are unit orthogonal vectors in the internal space .",
    "we work in the minkowski spacetime with the metric tensor @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is the covariant derivative given by @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the ( constant ) unit vector defined by @xmath17    the u(1 ) subgroup is gauged by the vector potential @xmath18 whose dynamics is dictated by the chern - simons term .",
    "the potential @xmath19 gives a self interaction of the field @xmath20 .",
    "note that the minima of the potential reside either on , @xmath21 or @xmath22 in 2 + 1 dimensions , soliton solutions of this system has been studied @xcite . in such a case , the u(1 )",
    "symmetry is unbroken in ( [ vac1 ] ) , whereas ( [ vac2 ] ) corresponds to the spontaneous breaking of this symmetry .    in 1 + 1 dimensions",
    ", we expect that the disconnected vacua facilitate the existence of solitons . because of the existence of disconnected vacua",
    ", we can have non - trivial mappings between the boundaries of the 1-dimensional space and these disconnected vacua and thus topological stability ( figure [ vacua ] ) . in order to obtain these soliton solutions ,",
    "we start with schwinger s energy - momentum tensor @xcite , which in the static limit becomes : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the magnetic field .",
    "a conserved current can also be constructed : @xmath25.\\ ] ] for static solutions which depend on one space coordinate ( say @xmath26 ) , @xmath27 becomes : @xmath28 + \\frac{1}{4}\\phi_3\\frac{\\partial a_2}{\\partial x},\\ ] ] and the corresponding conserved total charge is : @xmath29 we also have @xmath30 with @xmath31 which leads to @xmath32    rearranging ( [ energeq ] ) , we can write @xcite@xcite : @xmath33 \\pm 4\\pi t.\\ ] ] this leads to the bogomolnyi conditions : @xmath34 and @xmath35 which minimize the energy functional in a particular topological sector .",
    "in this section , we obtain analytical domain - wall - like solutions in the case where the fields depend on only one of the space coordinates ( say @xmath26 ) .",
    "the @xmath36-fields , which are constrained on a @xmath9 , are assumed to vary on a longitude .",
    "because of the u(1 ) subgroup , this longitude is arbitrarily rotated to @xmath37 , in order to simplify the solutions .",
    "let us expand the bogomolnyi equations ( [ bog1 ] ) and ( [ bog2 ] ) as : @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 and @xmath42 it can be easily shown that the above equations , together with appropriate boundary conditions , lead to : @xmath43 and @xmath44 which implies @xmath45 note that @xmath46 for the desired solutions .",
    "we also have @xmath47 equations ( [ dphi3 ] ) and ( [ da2 ] ) are readily solved to obtain @xmath48 @xmath45and@xmath31 from these , the @xmath49 field is also calculated : @xmath30 or @xmath50 @xmath51 is plotted in figure [ fig1 ] , and @xmath52 is shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "using ( [ energeq ] ) , the energy density can be easily calculated @xmath53 which is plotted in figure ( [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "it is seen that the magnetic field and energy are concentrated in a thin region around @xmath54 , quite similar to the domain wall solutions of the @xmath6 theory in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions . here",
    ", the solution corresponds to a string on the @xmath55-plane which extends along the @xmath56-axis . integrating the energy density over @xmath26 ,",
    "the total energy per unit length of the string is obtained : @xmath57 in order to check for the stability of the solution , we apply the scale transformation @xmath58 which leads to @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are positive quantities independent of @xmath62 .",
    "the energy is found to be a minimum at @xmath63 , signalling the stability .",
    "let us calculate the topological charge density ( the zero component of topological current ) . from ( [ topcharge ] ) , we obtain @xmath64,\\ ] ] which is shown in figure ( [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the total topological charge is subsequently obtained : @xmath65 the values of @xmath66 and @xmath67 are seen to satisfy the well known inequality @xmath68 .",
    "the spin of the solution @xcite@xcite is easily shown to vanish : @xmath69",
    "in a field theory possessing the vacuum manifold @xmath70 , formulated in a d - dimensional space plus 1 time dimension , the localized static solutions constitute a mapping @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the boundary of the d - dimensional space .",
    "if the homotopy group of this mapping is nontrivial , then topological , soliton - like solutions are expected @xcite .",
    "we showed that the nonlinear o(3 ) sigma model with a chern - simons term and a suitable potential is such a model .",
    "we obtained examples of these solutions which satisfy the bogomolnyi s conditions . on the @xmath55-plane",
    ", solutions correspond to a string along the @xmath56-axis , with energy density , charge density , and magnetic field confined to a thin band near to @xmath54 .",
    "the width of this band ( string ) depends on the value of the parameter @xmath73 .",
    "we also showed that the solutions are not scale invariant under @xmath74 .",
    "rather , the energy is minimum for @xmath75 , indicating the stability of the solutions .",
