    "helium clusters are weakly bound quantum systems as a consequence of the small atomic mass and the weak van der waals interaction between helium atoms .",
    "there are several recent papers  @xcite reviewing the most relevant aspects of the physics and chemistry of these remarkable systems , to which we refer the interested reader .",
    "it was found about twenty years ago that helium clusters could pick up closed shell molecules singly and that these molecules were located in the interior of the clusters  @xcite .",
    "it is now well established that helium clusters may virtually capture any kind of atoms and molecules , most of which are located in their bulk .",
    "alkali atoms are the sole known exception , as they remain on the surface of the cluster upon their capture .",
    "electronic spectroscopy allows to obtain information on the cluster structure , and in particular on the position of embedded impurities in the cluster , via the shift and width of the electronic transitions  @xcite .",
    "heavy alkaline - earth atoms but magnesium exhibit a different behavior for each helium isotope , in contrast with most impurities , which solvate similarly in both .",
    "they are solvated in @xmath1he but not in @xmath0he clusters , in which case they reside in dimples on the cluster surface . although still debated , the magnesium atom is most likely in a very delocalized state within the bulk of the @xmath0he cluster .",
    "clusters formed by a mixture of both helium isotopes are particularly interesting , as they are made of bosons and fermions with different mass interacting through the same potential .",
    "it is known that in the bulk , the excess in kinetic energy pushes the @xmath1he atoms to the liquid surface  @xcite , an effect that also shows up in mixed droplets , see _",
    "e.g. _ ref .  .",
    "it has been experimentally found that , depending on the size and composition of the drop , ca atoms reside in bubbles at or near the @xmath0he-@xmath1he interface  @xcite .",
    "this scenario has been confirmed by density functional ( df ) calculations  @xcite .",
    "heavy alkaline - earth atoms thus may offer a unique opportunity to study the interface of isotopically mixed helium clusters  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the study of small mixed @xmath0he-@xmath1he clusters doped with one ca atom .",
    "our calculations are based on diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) methods using current realistic interatomic interactions . in particular , we have calculated density distribution functions and have estimated the atomic shifts and widths for ca attached to a cluster , for several combinations of the number of isotopes in it .",
    "results for some @xmath0he and @xmath1he clusters doped with ca are also presented to complete the discussion .",
    "it is worth stressing that , while @xmath0he clusters doped with different impurities have been thoroughly studied , theoretical works on doped @xmath1he clusters are scarce  @xcite apart from those carried out within the df approach .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ method ] we give some details about the dmc calculations . in sec .",
    "[ results ] we present our results , and in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] we present a brief summary .",
    "the dmc description is based on a variational or importance sampling wave function .",
    "we have used a rather simple form , which contains the basic required properties .",
    "it is a generalization of the trial function adopted in our previous studies on pristine mixed helium clusters  @xcite .",
    "it is written as a product of seven terms @xmath3 consisting of a jastrow factor for each pair of different atoms , plus the spin - up and -down slater determinants required to satisfy the pauli exclusion principle for @xmath1he fermions . here",
    "@xmath4 represents the set of @xmath5 coordinates of the atoms forming the cluster .",
    "any of the jastrow terms has the generic form @xmath6^{\\nu_{mn } } - \\alpha_{mn } r_{ij } \\right )   \\ ; , \\label{bosons}\\ ] ] where indices @xmath7 run over the corresponding type of atom , and includes a short - range repulsion term with parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 associated to it , and a long - range confining term with corresponding parameter @xmath10 . the so defined @xmath11 function is explicitly symmetric under the exchange of particles .",
    "the antisymmetry required for @xmath1he fermions is incorporated in the slater determinants @xmath12 and @xmath13 , related to the spin - up and -down fermions .",
    "these slater determinants are of primary relevance because they define the set of spin - up and -down nodal surfaces which strongly constrain the dmc algorithm . as in our previous works  @xcite we have assumed a shell - model like structure , taking the single - particle orbitals as harmonic polynomials of the fermionic cartesian coordinates , thus guaranteeing that the resulting slater determinants are translationally invariant .",
    "moreover , we have always assumed a filling scheme in which the total spin is minimum , either 0 or 1/2 , respectively , for @xmath14 even or odd .",
    "also , the so called feynman - cohen back - flow  @xcite has been incorporated into the scheme by substituting @xmath15 in the slater determinants  @xcite . for the backflow function @xmath16 we choose the medium - range form used in ref .  , namely @xmath17 , with the same value of @xmath18  @xmath1 .",
    "the form of the short - range repulsion term was introduced long ago by mcmillan  @xcite for describing the homogeneous liquid @xmath0he using a 12 - 6 lennard - jones interaction .",
    "the values of the two parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 are fixed by the short - range behavior of a pair of atoms . in our calculations",
    "we have employed the he - he aziz hfd - b(he )  @xcite potential , and that of hinde  @xcite for the @xmath21 ca - he interaction , as parametrized in ref .  .",
    "for all cluster sizes we have used the following values : @xmath22   , @xmath23   , @xmath24   , @xmath25   , as in previous works on pristine and isotopically mixed helium clusters , and @xmath26   , and @xmath27   .",
    "thus , the trial or importance sampling wave function contains only five free parameters , namely @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , which have been determined by minimizing the expectation value of the hamiltonian .    for the dmc algorithm",
    "we have used the short - time green function approximation  @xcite with an @xmath33 form  @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this approximate green function satisfies the microreversibility condition ( detailed balance condition ) .",
    "moreover , the random process was constrained so as not to traverse the nodal surfaces , using the so called fixed node approximation .",
    "in figures [ den2020]-[den0808 ] are plotted the densities in the @xmath36 plane of the @xmath37 ( 20,20 ) , ( 20,8 ) , ( 8,20 ) , and ( 8,8 ) clusters . after a simulation running for a long thermalization time",
    "we have stored a large number of walkers ( typically 10@xmath38 ) to get a mixed estimator of the probability densities .",
    "a series of angular rotations have been performed on each walker to place the ca atom on the @xmath39-axis , defined as the line joining the impurity and the cluster center - of - mass .",
    "afterwards , a projection on the @xmath36 plane has been performed .",
    "the resulting plots thus exhibit axial symmetry .",
    "these clusters display an already well known structure , with a core of @xmath0he atoms surrounded by a shell of @xmath1he atoms .",
    "interestingly , in spite of the small number of helium atoms , the tendency of ca to reside at the @xmath0he-@xmath1he interface is clearly visible .",
    "note also the peak in the @xmath0he densities near to ca , and those appearing in the @xmath1he shell : the one near the impurity is reminiscent of the solvation shell that would fully develop in a larger cluster made of either kind of atoms .",
    "we attribute the @xmath1he peak distant from the impurity to the tendency of the @xmath1he atoms to reside , whenever possible , far from the impurity  @xcite because the ca - he interaction is weaker than the he - he one . within df theory ,",
    "a qualitatively similar structure has been found for clusters with @xmath40 and @xmath41 18 , 32 , 50 , and 68  @xcite .",
    "the calculated ground state energies of the clusters , as well as the solvation energy of the dopant , defined as @xmath42 are given in table  [ ener34 ] .",
    "we mention that elhiyani and lewerenz  @xcite have carried out calculations for ca@@xmath0he@xmath34 clusters using the same he - he interaction than ours , and a ca - he pair potential they have obtained at the ccsd(t ) level of accuracy , as hinde s one  @xcite .",
    "their ca solvation energies for clusters with @xmath43 20 and 40 are -12.29  ( 1 ) and -16.55  ( 6 )  k , respectively , in good agreement with ours as displayed in table  [ ener34 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ solvat34 ] are plotted the ca solvation energies per helium atom as a function of the total number of helium atoms in the cluster .",
    "note the conspicuous shell oscillations for @xmath44 .",
    "we discuss them below .",
    "the study of the lightest @xmath1he clusters has a great interest , as they are a challenge for theoretical methods due to their very small binding energy .",
    "in particular , pure @xmath1he clusters are bound only for sizes greater than @xmath45 atoms  @xcite , and small mixed @xmath0he-@xmath1he clusters present instability regions as a function of @xmath46 and @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the presence of one @xmath0he atom is enough to trigger the binding of twenty @xmath1he atoms  @xcite , showing the importance of the zero - point motion in the stability of small helium clusters .",
    "the ca - he interaction potential is weaker than the he - he one , and its minimum lies at a larger distance .",
    "nevertheless , due to the different zero - point energy of ca and he atoms , we have found that the presence of one single ca atom causes that clusters made of any number of atoms are bound , irrespective of their bosonic or fermionic character .",
    "this is an obvious result for @xmath0he clusters , but it is not for @xmath1he clusters . we give in table  [ ener3 ] the total energy of ca@@xmath1he@xmath35 clusters , and have already represented them , divided by @xmath14 , in fig .",
    "[ solvat34 ] ( @xmath44 results ) because as the pristine @xmath1he clusters are not bound , it makes sense to plot these energies together with the solvation energy of ca discussed before .",
    "it is interesting to see the sharp minima at @xmath47 , 8 , and 20 .",
    "these numbers correspond to the first shell closures of the three - dimensional spherical harmonic oscillator , in spite that the helium density distributions are far from being spherical , especially for small @xmath14 values ( see fig .",
    "[ contcahe3 ] ) . we have no plausible explanation for this finding . however , it is worth recalling that in cylindrical symmetry @xcite , the first two minima also arise from the @xmath48 and @xmath49 shell closures corresponding to this geometry , see _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .  .    for ca@@xmath1he@xmath35 clusters we may also calculate the differences @xmath50 than can be interpreted as the negative of the he evaporation energies  @xcite",
    "we have plotted @xmath51 in fig .",
    "[ vapor ] .",
    "the large drops in the evaporation energy after @xmath52 , and 20 correlate well with the `` magicity '' of these values , i.e. , with shell closures . in the @xmath53 range , the evaporation energy displays some structure , with a weak local maximum at @xmath54 .    as representative examples , the density distributions in the @xmath36 plane for the ca@@xmath1he@xmath35 clusters with @xmath14= 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 8 , and 20",
    "are plotted in fig .",
    "[ contcahe3 ] .",
    "it can be clearly seen the tendency of the ca atom to become solvated in @xmath1he clusters .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the morphology of @xmath0he and @xmath1he clusters doped with ca . to this end , we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ contcahe4cahe3 ] the density distributions corresponding to helium clusters made of 40 atoms doped with it .",
    "it can be seen that ca is in a dimple state on the surface of the @xmath0he cluster , whereas it moves towards the bulk of the cluster in the case of @xmath1he . in spite of this bulk location ,",
    "the ca@@xmath1he@xmath55 cluster is not spherically symmetric .",
    "this also happens for clusters doped with other weakly attractive impurities , such as mg in small @xmath0he clusters  @xcite .",
    "the reason is the tendency of the system to have a helium density as close as possible to its liquid value in order to maximize its binding .",
    "this is easier to archieve in an off - center location for small clusters , even for @xmath56 . in this case",
    "the two @xmath1he atoms are slightly apart as a consequence of their large zero - point motion , not fully compensated by the attraction of the ca impurity .",
    "this is the reason of the very low he density in a cylindrical region surrounding the @xmath39-axis , see the corresponding panel in fig .",
    "[ contcahe3 ] , which is absent in the other clusters .",
    "eventually , when the number of @xmath1he atoms increases , the center - of - masses of the helium moiety and the impurity nearly coincide  @xcite .",
    "the dmc calculation provides us with a set @xmath57 of walkers indicating the instantaneous position of each atom in the cluster . from these walkers",
    "we have calculated the density distribution functions plotted in the previous subsections .",
    "here we use them to obtain the absorption spectrum of the @xmath58 transition in ca .",
    "electronic spectroscopy is a powerful tool to disclose the structure of impurities in helium clusters , since the shift and width of the electronic transitions is very sensitive to the dopant environment  @xcite .",
    "lax method  @xcite has been since long time ago the standard way to determine the absorption spectrum of a dopant atom in helium clusters .",
    "it makes use of the franck - condon principle within a semiclassical approach .",
    "it has been adapted and used by several authors to analyze the absorption spectrum of _",
    "e.g. _ , lithium in solid h@xmath59  @xcite , and of different atoms in helium clusters  @xcite .",
    "the particular case of ca atoms we are interested in has been addressed within df in pure and mixed helium clusters  @xcite .",
    "lax method is usually applied in conjunction with the diatomics - in - molecules approach  @xcite , in which the atom - cluster complex is treated as a diatomic molecule , the helium moiety playing the role of the other atom .",
    "we have calculate the line shape of the electronic absorptium transition in ca as @xmath60 where @xmath61 refers to the positions of the atoms , and @xmath62 and @xmath63 are , respectively , the ground and excited states potential energy surfaces .",
    "we have used the ca - he @xmath64 interaction of ref .   for the ground state , and the @xmath65 and @xmath66 potentials of ref .",
    "for the excited states . in short , for a given value of @xmath67",
    ", a @xmath68 matrix has to be diagonalized to determine the three components of the absorption line , each one arising from a different potential energy surface , i.e. , eigenvalue of the excited energy matrix , see refs .   for the details .    in fig",
    "[ abs1 ] is plotted the absorption spectrum of ca for several combinations of @xmath46 and @xmath14 values .",
    "the energies are referred to the free ca atom value ( 23650 @xmath69 ) .",
    "for so few helium atoms , there is no appreciable shift , but an appreciable width increasing as @xmath14 does at fixed @xmath46 .",
    "a large enough number of walkers bear the information corresponding to a quasi - free ca atom within the simulation volume .",
    "this is the reason of the narrow peak at @xmath70 .",
    "a similar peak appears in the experiments , and it is due to the excitation of gas - phase ca atoms present in the doping chamber @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ abs2 ] is plotted the absorption spectrum of ca for three selected @xmath71 combinations with @xmath72 .",
    "the contributions from the three potential energy surfaces are shown , and the long tail at high frequencies is identified as likely arising from the very repulsive contribution of the @xmath66 pair potential . the shift in the ( 0 , 40 ) case",
    "is clearly seen . finally , in fig .",
    "[ abs3 ] we display the absorption spectrum of ca@@xmath1he@xmath35 for increasing values of @xmath14 .",
    "not surprisingly , the @xmath56 case shows no appreciable shift and a small width . as @xmath14 increases , both the shift and width progressively do .",
    "within the diffusion monte carlo framework , we have studied the structure and energetics of small mixed @xmath0he-@xmath1he clusters doped with ca .",
    "we have found that a single ca atom is able to produce bound clusters made of any number of helium atoms , irrespective of their fermionic or bosonic character . in the case of @xmath1he clusters , this is a somewhat unexpected result , as the ca - he interaction is weaker than the he - he one .",
    "we attribute it to a zero - point motion effect .      in the case of mixed clusters ,",
    "our calculations show the tendency of the impurity to sit at the @xmath0he-@xmath1he interface , although the small number of fermions that we can microscopically handle does not allow us to make a clear distinction between the interface and the rest of the mixed cluster .",
    "morphologically , we have found that doped mixed clusters obtained within df theory  @xcite are qualitatively similar to those obtained within the microscopic dmc approach .",
    "finally , we have used the dmc walkers to semiclassically obtain the absorption spectrum of ca around the @xmath2 transition , and have found that it is slightly blue - shifted from that of free - atom transition , with a clear dependence on the size and composition of the mixed cluster in spite of the small number of helium atoms in the studied systems .",
    "we want to mention that the excitation and emission spectra of ca atoms implanted in liquid @xmath0he and @xmath1he have been measured @xcite , and that their determination in the case of liquid mixtures could also be carried out as a function of pressure and composition .",
    "we are at present extending the method implemented in ref .",
    "@xcite to address this issue .",
    "we thank alberto hernando and mart pi for useful discussions and comments , and mohamed elhiyani and marius lewerenz for providing us with their results prior to publication .",
