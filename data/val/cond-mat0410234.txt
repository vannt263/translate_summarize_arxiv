    "the formation of three - dimensional ( @xmath0 ) localized solitons is a subject of much intrinsic interest in mathematical and non - linear physics , and it is intriguing that no integrable models supporting them appear to exist . despite the absence of integrability ,",
    "the quadratically coupled equations of parametric nonlinear optics and coherently coupled atomic - molecular bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) systems appear to be the simplest physically relevant hamiltonian models having @xmath0 localized solitons @xcite .",
    "they also provide an experimental route towards demonstration of the closely related ground state of the schrdinger - newton ( sn )  equation @xcite introduced to describe gravitationally bound bose gases , and later revived by penrose and others @xcite as a possible model of the collapse of the quantum - mechanical wave - function .",

    "these more general models may also have astrophysical or quantum - mechanical significance .",
    "the surprisingly close parallels to nonlinear optics , in the related fields of quantum many - body theory and atom optics , have now resulted in the emergence of a new field of research  nonlinear atom optics with parametric nonlinearity .",
    "the first step towards seeing molecular condensation was recently undertaken in transient experiments with a bose - einstein condensate of @xmath2rb atoms @xcite , in which interference measurements were indicative of coherent molecule formation .",

    "in addition to this remarkable experimental progress , the original effective quantum field theory @xcite for coupled atomic - molecular becs has also been developed ; it now incorporates renormalization , the treatment of intrinsic pair correlations , quantum fluctuations , and thermal effects ( see , e.g. , @xcite , as well as a recent review paper @xcite for further references ) .    in the near - classical limit of large numbers of atoms or photons , the relevant equations for parametric solitons",

    "we analyze the superchemistry equations in the mean - field limit , to obtain the precise conditions under which @xmath0 atomic - molecular bec solitons can form .",
    "approximate soliton solutions are found analytically , by means of a variational approach with a gaussian and an exponential ansatz .",
    "we then numerically study the dynamical stability of the resulting solitons on a @xmath0 lattice , together with comparing the results with exact numerically solutions .",
    "we find that there are large regions of stability in parameter space , depending on the energy difference between the atomic and molecular condensates , the numbers of atoms involved , and the coupling strengths .",
    "for simplicity , the analysis only includes repulsive @xmath1-wave scattering between the atoms , and assumes no other @xmath1-wave interactions .",
    "while more general @xmath1 -wave interactions are simple enough to include , we have focused on a relatively simple case here in the interest of keeping the parameter - space manageable .",

    "the total number of particles @xmath316 is a single valued function of the eva variables , and each of these variables can be treated as a single valued function of @xmath117 and the three remaining variables .",
    "because of this , the specific choice of the variables used here for the constrained minimization [ relying on the elimination of @xmath111 in favor of @xmath317 , via @xmath318 is just a matter of convinience and appears to be the simplest .",
    "calculations with enforced spherical symmetry were used only after ensuring that the full @xmath0 lattice simulations give identical results , which was verified for a smaller set of test points in the ( @xmath100-@xmath60 ) parameter space .",
    "the relevant time scales for dynamical stability of the soliton solutions , for each pair of the parameters @xmath259 and @xmath60 , are determined by comparing the results with those observed for the case when the nonlinear coupling terms are removed from the equations of motion .",
    "for example , defining vectors @xmath319 , we interpolate between stable and unstable solutions @xmath320 and @xmath321 by first setting @xmath322 where @xmath323 runs from @xmath324 to @xmath325 and then normalizing so that @xmath326 .",

    "<S> we present a theoretical analysis of three - dimensional ( @xmath0 ) matter - wave solitons and their stability properties in coupled atomic and molecular bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) . </S>",
    "<S> the soliton solutions to the mean - field equations are obtained in an approximate analytical form by means of a variational approach . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate soliton stability within the parameter space described by the atom - molecule conversion coupling , atom - atom @xmath1-wave scattering , and the bare formation energy of the molecular species . in terms of ordinary optics , this is analogous to the process of sub / second - harmonic generation in a quadratic non - linear medium modified by a cubic nonlinearity , together with a phase mismatch term between the fields . </S>",
    "<S> while the possibility of formation of multidimensional spatio - temporal solitons in pure quadratic media has been theoretically demonstrated previously , here we extend this prediction to matter - wave interactions in bec systems where higher - order non - linear processes due to interparticle collisions are unavoidable and may not be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> the stability of the solitons predicted for repulsive atom - atom interactions is investigated by direct numerical simulations of the equations of motion in a full @xmath0 lattice . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis also leads to a possible technique for demonstrating the ground state of the schrdinger - newton and related equations that describe bose - einstein condensates with non - local inter - particle forces . </S>"
