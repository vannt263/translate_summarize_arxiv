    "the luminous ( l@xmath72.5@xmath8 l@xmath9 ) helium - rich o - type star  is one of the few hot subdwarfs that have been detected in the x - ray band .",
    "x - rays from hot subdwarfs can have two different origins : they can be produced by accretion onto a neutron star or white dwarf companion or they can be emitted by shock - heated plasma in their stellar wind , as it occurs in early type stars of higher mass and luminosity . in both cases , x - ray observations of hot subdwarfs are useful because they provide a way to study the relatively weak winds of these low - mass stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "x - rays from  were discovered with an  observation carried out in 2011 @xcite .",
    "the spectrum was fit by the sum of a blackbody with temperature kt=45@xmath1010 ev plus a faint power - law with photon index @xmath112 , giving a luminosity between @xmath12 and @xmath13 erg s@xmath1 ( for d=2 kpc , @xcite ) . the large uncertainty on the luminosity , due to the poorly constrained spectral parameters , left open both of the above possibilities for the origin of the x - ray emission in .",
    "the  data also showed a periodicity at 19.2 s ( with a statistical significance of 3.2@xmath14 ) pointing to the presence of a compact companion .",
    "however , no evidence for a binary nature had been reported in the literature @xcite and a recent campaign of high - resolution optical spectroscopy did not reveal radial velocity variations @xcite .",
    "this means that either the orbital plane has a very small inclination and/or the orbital period is of the order of months , or that  is indeed a single star and the reported signal was spurious .",
    "here we report the results of a longer follow - up  observation of  that we obtained in order to clarify the origin of its x - ray emission .",

    "was observed with the  satellite for 72 ks on 2016 february 1st .",
    "the three ccd cameras of the epic instrument were operated in imaging mode with a time resolution of 73 ms for the pn camera @xcite and of 0.9 s for the two mos cameras @xcite .",
    "the medium thickness filter was used for all cameras .",
    "the data were processed with sas v15 .",
    "we used only single- and double - pixel events for the pn ( pattern @xmath15 4 ) and single- and multiple - pixel events for the mos ( pattern @xmath15 12 ) .    for the timing analysis",
    ", we extracted the source counts from a circle of radius 15@xmath16 and converted their arrival times to the solar system barycenter .",
    "we used only the events in the energy range from 0.15 to 2 kev , as it was done for the 2011 data by @xcite .",
    "this resulted in 1519 pn counts and 485 mos counts .",
    "we estimate that the background contributes about 22% and 17% of these counts , respectively .    in order to take into account a possible spin - up or spin - down of the source during the @xmath74.5 years between the two  observations with plausible values of @xmath17 s s@xmath1 , we considered possible periods in the range from 19.1 to 19.2 s ( the value measured in 2011 was p@xmath18=19.156@xmath100.001 s ) . using the sum of the pn and mos counts",
    ", we found a maximum value of the z@xmath19 statistics @xcite of 8.74 , for a period p=19.174 s ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - z2 ] ) .",
    "however , the corresponding probability of chance occurrence , taking into account the number of sampled periods , is too large to claim a significant detection .    through monte carlo simulations we found that a sinusoidal modulation with pulsed fraction of 33% , as found in the 2011 data , has a probability of 99.9% of being detected at a significance above 5@xmath14 in an observation with the same duration and counting statistics as the 2016 one .",
    "the corresponding probability for a pulsed fraction of 25% ( the lower bound of the 2@xmath14 uncertainty of the 2011 value ) is 84% .",
    "therefore , the lack of a detection in the new data strongly suggest that either the pulsations in  disappeared ( i.e. the pulsed fraction decreased making them undetectable ) or the peak at 19.2 s appearing in the 2011 periodogram was caused by a statistical fluctuation .    for the spectral analysis we used circular extraction regions with radii of 20@xmath16 for the source and 50@xmath16 for the background .",
    "time intervals of high background were excluded .",
    "we merged the spectra from the three cameras into a single epic spectrum and produced the appropriate response matrix using the task multixmmselect .",
    "following exactly the same procedures , we extracted also the epic spectrum of  from the 2011 data , which we reprocessed using sas v15 .",
    "the effective exposure times of the 2016 and 2011 spectra are 48 ks and 28 ks , respectively . by comparing the two spectra we found no evidence that the flux or spectral shape changed between the two observations .",
    "therefore , we performed the spectral analysis by jointly fitting the 2011 and 2016 data in the 0.2 - 2 kev energy range using the xspec software .",
    "simple models ( power law , blackbody , thermal bremsstrahlung ) modified by interstellar absorption could not fit the data ( values of reduced @xmath202.5 ) .",
    "thermal plasma emission models , with abundances fixed at solar values @xcite were also rejected , but they could give satisfactory fits if some of the abundances were let free to vary .",
    "for simplicity , and considering that the quality of the data does not allow us to constrain a large number of spectral parameters , we considered only a single - temperature plasma described by the apec model .",
    "we found strong evidence for an overabundance of c and ne , the latter being required to fit the significant excess of emission visible in the spectra at @xmath70.9 kev .",
    "the derived c and ne abundances were found to depend on that of he , which was however poorly constrained by the x - ray data .",
    "therefore , considering that  is an extreme he - rich star , we fixed the abundance of this element to a mass fraction of x@xmath21=0.99 . in this case",
    "we obtained a good fit with temperature kt=0.22 kev , absorption n@xmath22 @xmath23 , and solar abundances relative to hydrogen for all the other elements ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - sp ] and model a in table  [ tab1 ] ) . from optical studies we know , however , that also other elements are overabundant in this star .",
    "indeed , an equally good fit was obtained with the abundances of he , c , n ,",
    "si and fe fixed at the values of @xcite , but also in this case an overabundance of ne was required ( model b in table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the two models result in slightly different values of the unabsorbed flux , both of a few @xmath24 erg @xmath23 s@xmath1 ( 0.2 - 2 kev ) , which , for a distance of 2 kpc @xcite , correspond to x - ray luminosites in the range @xmath25 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "we performed also spectral fits fixing the interstellar absorption at n@xmath26=6.2@xmath2710@xmath28 @xmath23 , based on the  reddening of e(b ",
    "v)=0.09 @xcite and the relation derived by @xcite . in the case of model",
    "a , we obtained a good fit ( @xmath29=1.03 ) with similar abundances and a slightly lower temperature kt=0.20@xmath100.01 kev , while model b resulted in a worse fit to the data ( @xmath29=1.7 ) .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     notes : abundances are given in mass fraction ; the flux refers to the 0.2 - 2 kev range and is corrected for the absorption ; errors are at 1@xmath14 .",
    "the non - detection of a significant periodicity at 19.2 s in the new data ( which have a higher counting statistics than the previous ones ) casts doubts on the presence of a neutron star companion in .",
    "this result , coupled to the lack of radial velocity variations in the optical spectra @xcite , leads us to conclude that  is most likely a single star . indeed ,",
    "one of the scenarios proposed to explain the origin of extreme helium - rich stars is that they result from the merger of a binary composed of a he white dwarf and a more massive co white dwarf .",
    "the lighter white dwarf is disrupted and a single he - enriched star is formed @xcite .",
    "if  is a single star , the observed x - ray emission can not be powered by mass accretion onto a neutron star companion , with the interesting consequence that it has to originate in  itself .",
    "the x - ray emission from massive o - type stars is related to the presence of powerful radiation - driven winds .",
    "x - rays are produced in the winds of single stars by shock - heated plasma resulting from various instabilities ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "an empirical correlation has been found between the x - ray and bolometric luminosities of early type stars : @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the x - ray luminosity we derived for   corresponds to a value of @xmath31 , fully consistent with the observed dispersion around the above average relation .",
    "it is thus natural to ascribe the x - rays observed in  to the same , or similar , processes that are at work in the stellar winds of massive early type stars .",
    "there is in fact evidence from uv and optical spectroscopy that , despite its low luminosity compared to normal o - type stars , has a stellar wind .",
    "the inferred mass - loss rate is @xmath32=3@xmath33 @xmath5 yr@xmath1 @xcite , in good agreement with the predictions of the most recent theoretical models of radiatively - driven winds in low luminosity hot stars @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_lxlb ] we plot the x - ray and bolometric luminosities of the five sdo stars that have been detected in the x - ray range . for comparison ,",
    "the values for a sample of normal o stars seen in the rosat all sky survey @xcite are also shown in the figure .",
    "@xcite is another single , he - rich star very similar to  for what concerns its optical spectrum , composition and mass - loss properties @xcite .",
    "these two stars lie very close in the @xmath34-@xmath35 plane .",
    "the same is true for the spectroscopic binary , which is in a 1.55 day orbit with a neutron star or white dwarf companion @xcite . for this star we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig_lxlb ] the x - ray luminosity observed when the compact companion is eclipsed by the sdo star and likely due to wind emission ; out of the eclipse the luminosity is a factor ten higher and pulsations at 13.2 s are observed .",
    "the x - ray spectra of these three stars are similar , except for the presence of a harder component in  which might be related to its binary nature .",
    "the two other sdo stars plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_lxlb ] ( feige 34 and ; @xcite ) are less luminous and their faint x - ray emission has not been studied in detail .",
    "it is however remarkable that they lie on the extrapolation of the average l@xmath2-l@xmath36 relation observed at higher luminosity .",
    "the temperature found in the spectral fits of  is in the lower range of the values seen in the sample of o - type stars observed with the  epic instrument , when a single - temperature plasma is sufficient to describe their low resolution x - ray spectra @xcite .",
    "this might be related to the weaker wind of  compared to that of normal o - type stars .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the weak - wind o - type dwarf @xmath37 col ( hd 38666 ) , with a mass - loss rate @xmath32 = 10@xmath38 @xmath5 yr@xmath1 @xcite similar to that of , has an x - ray emitting wind with higher temperature ( kt@xmath70.4 kev , @xcite ) , despite its lower wind velocity ( v@xmath39=1,200 km s@xmath1 wrt v@xmath39=2,000 km s@xmath1 , @xcite ) .",
    "however , we caution that the temperatures derived from low - resolution spectroscopy of faint x - ray sources , such as the hot subdwarfs discussed here , might be affected by the uncertainties in the element abundances .",
    "instruments with large collecting area and high spectral resolution are needed to address these issues in more detail and fully exploit the study of subdwarfs in the context of a more general understanding of stellar wind in hot stars .",
