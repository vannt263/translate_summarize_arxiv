    "the well - known phenomenon of critical opalescence , for example , is caused due to fluctuations at all length scales during a second order phase transition .    in high - energy collision experiments ,",
    "the search for fluctuations of quantities ( like net - charge @xcite , @xcite ) over large number of events are important for searching the critical point @xcite or tri - critical point @xcite in the quantum chromodynamic ( qcd ) phase diagram .",
    "the study of particle multiplicity ratio fluctuation @xcite is another such example in this context .",
    "much in the same way as number of particles in a certain region of a system fluctuates , the everyday examples teach us that the temperature for physical systems can also fluctuate .",
    "apart from the examples from high - energy collisions where particle yield has shown the signature of temperature fluctuation @xcite , there are numerous other situations ( like cosmological perturbations in our expanding universe as sources of temperature fluctuation ) where the concerned system is not in global thermal equilibrium . the temperature , on",
    "the contrary varies with time and space .",
    "the temperature fluctuation associated with such kinds of systems encode transport properties like conductivity , shear viscosity , rates of chemical reactions etc .",
    "as the system evolves , dynamics dictates the temperature fluctuation until a state of minimum energy , or equilibrium is attained .",
    "the evolution of the fluctuations has been investigated for systems concerned with high - energy collisions employing boltzmann transport equation ( bte ) @xcite .",
    "it is now important to study temperature fluctuation as well as its evolution in such systems as they can characterize the medium created after high - energy collisions @xcite or may give a hint to the qcd critical point @xcite .        a medium with spatially fluctuating temperature can be schematically represented by fig .",
    "[ hotspots ] , where , within a large system , we encounter subsystems with different temperature values . in our present work , we model the time evolution of temperature fluctuation among these subsystems . at any certain time slice , we assume that the system comprises of temperature hotspots or zones evolving with time .",
    "this is essentially the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium of matter , where the temperature hotspots are weakly interacting .",
    "the assumption of weakly interacting hotspots is justified by the following - in any thermal system , the correlation distance may be taken to be the debye length ( @xmath0 ) which is @xmath1 @xcite , where @xmath2 is the coupling and @xmath3 is the average temperature . for @xmath4 and @xmath5 mev",

    "therefore , for the specific example of the medium created after heavy - ion collision ( hic ) , the system radius @xmath7 when @xmath8 mev ; and it can be safely argued that the temperature hotspots are effectively non - interacting .",
    "this in turn implies that particles in a certain temperature zone hardly affect those in other temperature zones .",
    "in fact , ( assuming zero chemical potential ) such systems can be represented by a collection of canonical ensembles @xcite with different temperature values .",
    "the probability that a certain member of the ensemble will be having a certain energy at some instant will depend on the fluctuating temperature values of the collection of subsystems .",
    "in the present work , we try to find out an evolution equation of the fluctuation in boltzmann parameter @xmath9 with the aid of boltzmann transport equation in relaxation time approximation ( rta ) assuming a constraint that the observation time is much less than the relaxation time of the thermal bath .",
    "later on we analyze the same problem for arbitrary observation time .",
    "hence , the manuscript is organized as follows . in section [ setup ]",
    "we begin by considering the bte and the evolution of @xmath10-fluctuation , followed by analysis specific to heavy - ion collisions with arbitrary observation time .",
    "we then discuss our results in section 3 where the relative variance of the boltzmann @xmath10-parameter will be compared with the similar quantities extracted from experimental data .",
    "lastly , we conclude by conjecturing possible connections with early universe cosmology .",
    "in order to gain qualitative insight into the evolution of temperature fluctuation , we consider an ansatz @xcite of the particle distribution function @xmath11 as    @xmath12    where we consider a medium with boltzmann distribution of massless particles ( @xmath13 ) with average inverse temperature @xmath14 , at some time slice . in the high temperature regime ( @xmath15 ) , that we are interested in , quantum statistics tend towards boltzmann distribution .",
    "the average inverse temperature of the system is calculated considering the arithmetic mean of the distribution of temperature hotspots , _",
    "i.e. _ if there are @xmath16 hotspots individually characterized by inverse temperatures @xmath17 , then the average is calculated as @xmath18 .",

    ", we would like to briefly mention some recent works done by the authors in @xcite connecting the @xmath99-parameter and the temperature fluctuation or _ non - extensivity _ of thermal systems .",

    "this observation re - emphasizes the relationship between temperature fluctuation and the @xmath99 parameter @xcite . + additionally , some comments about connecting certain observables in hics with the theory of cosmological perturbations are in order .",
