    "white dwarfs ( wds ) represent the evolutionary end point for most stars , since it is believed that all stars with initial masses below @xmath3@xmath4 become wds .",
    "an understanding of the evolution of wds is important in several contexts .",
    "for example , the loss of the stellar envelope in the form of a planetary nebula , during the transition from red giant to hot wd , recycles stellar material back into the interstellar medium .",
    "imprinted on the wd luminosity function is the history of star formation in our galaxy , and the cut - off at @xmath33500  k , below which no wds are known , places a limit of 810 gyr on the age of the disk ( e.g. oswalt et  al .",
    "1996 ; leggett , ruiz , & bergeron 1998 ) .",
    "theoretical studies have led to the formulation of the mass - radius relation and chandrasekhar mass limit for zero - temperature wds ( e.g. chandrasekhar 1931 , 1935 ; hamada & salpeter 1961 ) , and later to inclusion of the effects of the actual wd temperature due to the presence of a non - degenerate envelope ( wood 1992 ) and of variations in the core composition ( wood 1995 ) .",
    "direct tests of the theory are still rare , however , due to the difficulty of obtaining accurate measurements of the radii and masses of known wds . @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be measured from the balmer - line profiles in optical spectra , using theoretical model atmospheres ( holberg et  al .",
    "1985 ; kidder 1991 ) .",
    "bergeron , saffer , & liebert ( 1992 ) used this technique to determine the mass distribution of the population of single h - rich da wds , by combining the observational results with the theoretical mass - radius relation of wood ( 1992 ) .",
    "a combination of balmer - line measurements and parallax data can provide an independent means of obtaining wd masses and radii and , therefore , a new route for examining the evolutionary models . until recently ,",
    "most parallax measurements of wds have not been of sufficient accuracy to provide meaningful constraints , but the improvement in ground - based observations ( monet et  al .  1992 ) and the availability of space - based parallaxes from _ hipparcos _  ( esa 1997 ) has improved the situation .",
    "recent results suggest that the masses and radii are generally consistent with expectations ( vauclair et  al.1997 ; barstow et  al .",
    "1997 ; provencal et  al .",
    "1998 ; holberg et  al .  1998 ) .",
    "however , most of this work is restricted to the narrow range of masses near @xmath7 , encompassed in the population of isolated wds .",
    "furthermore , even with the new parallaxes , the overall uncertainties remain too large to provide a really thorough examination of the differences between theoretical models which make differing assumptions about the core and envelope compositions .",
    "observations of wds in binaries potentially represent a more direct test of the evolutionary models , since a dynamical wd mass can be determined purely from the orbital elements of the system . in practice , however , very few such systems have been available to be studied in sufficient detail to make such comparisons ; only sirius , procyon ( girard et  al .",
    "2000 ) , and a handful of other binary systems have provided useful directly measured wd masses to date .",
    "this situation is likely to improve dramatically in the next few years , because the _ rosat _  wide field camera ( wfc ) and _ euve _  sky surveys have revealed a number of new sources in which strong euv emission is detected from a previously unknown hot , but optically faint , companion of a visually bright star .",
    "several similar systems have also been discovered serendipitously in the td-1 survey data ( landsman et  al .",
    "1996 ) and in _ iue_observations of individual stars ( e.g. bhm - vitense 1980 , 1993 ) .",
    "this interesting , but rather disparate , group of objects has been the subject of a series of studies ( e.g. barstow et  al .",
    "1994 ; vennes et  al.1995 ; genova et  al .  1995 ; burleigh , barstow , & fleming 1997 ; burleigh , barstow , & holberg 1998 ; vennes , christian , & thorstensen 1998 ) .",
    "some of them should be new members of the class of wide binaries represented by sirius , comprising a normal dwarf or subgiant and a wd companion , and they present an opportunity to extend the sample of well - studied binary systems .",
    "others may belong to much closer binaries , which have passed through a common - envelope interaction ; however , with the exception of hr  8210 ( a spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 21.7  days ) , radial - velocity measurements have not revealed any of the objects to have a sufficiently short binary period ( e.g. vennes et  al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "none of these systems have been resolved using ground - based imaging , down to typical resolution limits of @xmath8 to @xmath9 , but a major complication is the overwhelming brightness of the primary in the visible band . since the difference in visual brightness between primary and wd can be 5  mag or more , a wd could easily be hidden in the wings of the image of the primary .",
    "this makes the effective resolution several times worse than what can be achieved with smaller magnitude differences .    the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) and its wide field planetary camera  2 ( wfpc2 ) provide the answer to these problems .",
    "wfpc2 allows imaging in the ultraviolet , where the brightnesses of both components become comparable .",
    "moreover , wfpc2 delivers diffraction - limited images at uv wavelengths of @xmath10 fwhm , making it possible to resolve binary components with separations down to about this amount .",
    "in this paper we report the initial results of an _ hst _ `` snapshot '' survey for resolved sirius - like binary systems . out of 17 targets observed to date , we have resolved 8 of them . in the following sections we discuss our analysis of the wfpc2 images , the nominal orbital periods for the resolved systems , and the limits on the orbital periods for those binaries that we were unable to resolve .",
    "in addition , we discuss the results for each individual object in the context of their known properties from earlier observations .",
    "table  [ binpar ] lists the physical parameters of the 17 systems that we have observed to date with wfpc2 .",
    "the data are drawn from the references cited above , as well as the simbad database , and include the spectral types and @xmath11 magnitudes of the optical primary stars , the distances to the systems ( mostly derived from the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes , or in six cases estimated from the spectral types and magnitudes ) , and the effective temperatures and approximate @xmath11 magnitudes of the wd components .",
    "the parameters for the wds have been derived mainly from their lyman  @xmath12 profiles by ourselves and other authors ( see references in table  [ binpar ] ) .",
    "however , such measurements suffer from known ambiguities .",
    "consequently , where possible , these parameters have been further constrained by soft x - ray / euv photometry and spectroscopy , together with knowledge of the primary distance .",
    "the primary stars have spectral types ranging from a1 to k2 , and with a few exceptions they are dwarfs or subgiants .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , > , < , < \" , ]",
    "we now discuss each of the observed systems briefly , starting with the resolved systems , and then turning to the unresolved ones .",
    "burleigh , barstow , & fleming ( 1997 ) reported the detection of hd  2133 in the _ rosat _ wfc all - sky survey and their subsequent identification of the wd companion through _ iue _ observations .",
    "the @xmath13 f7  v primary is included in the _ hipparcos _  catalogue , at a distance of 140  pc . adopting this distance , burleigh et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) estimate the @xmath14 and @xmath6 of the wd to be @xmath326,800  k and 7.75 , respectively .",
    "interestingly , the x - ray and euv data require the wd to have a pure h atmosphere and negligible interstellar column density , lower than might be expected in that direction . to our knowledge",
    ", no radial - velocity observations have been made of the system , but with a nominal orbital period of nearly 600  yr , it will not be possible to detect radial velocity variations in the foreseeable future .",
    "the wd was initially detected in the _ einstein _  medium sensitivity survey ( hence the ms designation ) but misidentified with a cluster of galaxies ( stocke et  al .",
    "it was subsequently detected by _",
    "euve _  and associated with a @xmath15 g2  v star ; an _ iue _  spectrum obtained by christian et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) confirmed the presence of a hot wd with @xmath16  k. with a large physical separation and a nominal orbital period @xmath36,000  years , we would not expect the g2  v primary to display any evidence for radial velocity variations . if better constraints can be placed on the wd s physical parameters through far - uv observations of the h lyman series with _ fuse _ , then it should be possible to show whether the two stars really are associated or , less likely , merely a chance alignment .",
    "the wd companion to hr  1358 ( hd  27483 ) was originally discovered by bhm - vitense ( 1993 ) through an _",
    "_ observation of the system .",
    "burleigh , barstow & holberg ( 1998 ) reanalysed the _ iue _ spectrum in association with the _ rosat _ pspc and wfc data .",
    "the active primary of this system is a binary in its own right , consisting of a pair of f6 v stars , with an orbital period of 3.05  days . for the _ hipparcos _ distance ,",
    "the wd uv spectrum is best matched by a @xmath17 and @xmath18  k model , with an estimated mass of @xmath19 . as a member of the hyades cluster , hr  1358 has a known age and it is possible to compare the age of the proposed @xmath20 progenitor with that of the cluster .",
    "burleigh et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) point out the the sum of the progenitor lifetime and wd age is significantly less than the cluster age ( 0.7  gyr ) , implying that the reported wd mass is an overestimate .",
    "now that the wd has been resolved with _ hst _ , it may be possible to obtain a balmer line spectrum of it and apply the standard analysis technique employed for isolated das to resolve this problem .",
    "the first indication of a wd companion to 56 per was through a flux excess in the 1565  band of the td-1 ultraviolet sky survey ( landsman , simon , & bergeron 1996 ) ; the wd was subsequently confirmed by these authors with an _ iue _ spectrum . at @xmath21",
    "k , the wd is actually too cool to be detected at euv or soft x - ray wavelengths .",
    "landsman et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) also obtained a surface gravity of @xmath22 , giving an implied wd mass of @xmath23 , well above the canonical @xmath3@xmath7 typical of single das .",
    "56 per ( @xmath24 , f4  v ) has a visual companion with @xmath25 , known since the 19th century , at a separation of about @xmath26 .",

    "( this amount of motion is roughly consistent with a nominal orbital period for the ab pair , calculated as above , of about 1500  yr . )",
    "the b component , however , is unlikely to be the wd , since landsman et  al .",
    "point out that 56  per  b is both too bright visually to be the wd , and too distant from 56  per  a as well , since their _ iue _ observation indicated that the wd is within @xmath28@xmath29 of the a component .    remarkably , fig .",

    "four _ resolved components , which can be seen in the 1700  image .",
    "the brightest component is seen to have a companion at a separation of only @xmath30 , and we identify this pair as the f4  v primary and the wd companion .",
    "they are denoted as `` aa '' and `` ab '' in fig .  2 ( and in table  [ seps ] ) on the assumption that aa is the f star , although we caution that it is possible that the star labelled aa could actually be the wd , and ab the visually bright primary .",
    "the b component is also resolved into a close pair , which we denote ba - bb , having a separation of @xmath31 .",
    "the nominal orbital period of the ba - bb pair is about 100  yr .    the close f4-wd pair , with a nominal period near 50  yr , is rather similar to the prototype sirius system .",
    "it is a prime candidate for continued _",

    "however , holberg et  al .  ( 1999 ) , using _",

    "<S> out of 17 targets observed , we have resolved eight of them with the wide field planetary camera  2 , using various ultraviolet filters . </S>",
    "<S> most of the implied orbital periods for the resolved systems are hundreds to thousands of years , but in at least three cases ( 56 persei , @xmath0  cygni , and re  j1925@xmath1566 ) it should be possible to detect the orbital motions within the next few years , and they may eventually yield new dynamically determined masses for the white - dwarf components . </S>",
    "<S> the 56  persei and 14  aurigae systems are found to be quadruple and quintuple , respectively , including the known optical components as well as the newly resolved white - dwarf companions . </S>",
    "<S> the mild barium star @xmath2  cygni , known to have an 18 year spectroscopic period , is marginally resolved . </S>",
    "<S> all of these new resolved sirius - type binaries will be useful in determining gravitational redshifts and masses of the white - dwarf components .    </S>",
