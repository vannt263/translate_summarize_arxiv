    "_ anderson localisation _ is the term used to describe a generic phenomenon , discovered in the late fifties by p. w. anderson , whereby the addition of a certain amount of disorder or randomness in an otherwise deterministic medium causes the waves propagating in the medium to become localised in space @xcite . for quantum systems ,",
    "the understanding of transport properties requires a thorough study of how the presence of disorder affects the nature of quantum states a question first addressed in an earlier paper of landauer and helland @xcite .",
    "since that time , the one - dimensional case has been discussed extensively and has led to a better understanding of the physical mechanisms that are responsible for localisation .",
    "a remarkable feature of one - dimensional systems is that almost all states become localised as soon as there is _ any _ disorder .",
    "this result , first conjectured by mott and twose @xcite , was made more rigorous by borland @xcite who considered an infinite chain of identical localised potentials separated by regions of zero potential .",
    "assuming that the lengths of these regions are independent random variables with the same probability distribution , borland studied the growth rate of the wave function on a semi - infinite chain with prescribed boundary conditions at one end .",
    "he then argued , by using a `` matching argument '' , that the positivity of the growth rate implies the exponential localisation of the wave functions .",
    "a purely mathematical proof using the properties of transfer matrices was given by matsuda and ishii @xcite .",
    "these physical arguments can in fact be made completely rigorous .",
    "the exponential growth of the solutions of the cauchy problem is a crucial feature of the proof that the spectrum has no absolutely continuous component @xcite , and that it is pure - point @xcite . if @xmath0 denotes a solution of the cauchy problem ( i.e. a solution of the schrdinger equation on the positive half - line subject to boundary conditions at @xmath1 ) then the quantity @xmath2 is a self - averaging quantity called the _",
    "lyapunov exponent _ of the disordered system .",
    "a rigorous demonstration of the fact that , under certain hypotheses , @xmath3 also quantifies the exponential decay of the _ eigenfunctions_ and therefore that its reciprocal can serve as a definition of the localisation length appears for the first time in ref .",
    "it should be borne in mind , however , that this definition of the localisation length is only useful if certain conditions are fulfilled ; cases where the definition is inappropriate will be considered briefly in  [ conclusionsection ] .    in order to illustrate the localisation phenomenon , anderson made use of a model in which the wave function solves a difference equation .",
    "the general solution of this `` tight - binding '' model takes the form of a product of random matrices , say , @xmath4 where the @xmath5 are independent and identically - distributed square matrices with a common probability measure @xmath6 . the quantity @xmath7",
    "is called the lyapunov exponent of the product of random matrices and , as we shall soon see , is effectively the same as @xmath3 .",
    "anderson localisation has been a powerful motivation for the study of products of random matrices . for this reason , the search for precise conditions on the measure @xmath6 that would guarantee the existence and the positivity of the lyapunov exponent @xmath8 has been of particular interest .",
    "the main result in this respect is due to furstenberg @xcite a result published the same year as borland s paper ; see also oseledec @xcite whose work can be considered as an extension to dynamical systems of the work of furstenberg and kesten @xcite .",
    "further developments of these results , and their application to the study of localisation , are described in the works of ishii @xcite , bougerol and lacroix  @xcite , carmona and lacroix @xcite , lifshits _",
    "@xcite , luck @xcite , pastur and figotin @xcite , crisanti _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and the references therein .",
    "an important milestone in the development of the theory of localisation was the discovery of the relationship between the lyapunov exponent and the integrated density of states @xmath9 .",
    "it turns out that the characteristic function @xmath10 viewed as a complex - valued function on @xmath11 , is _ analytic _ in the upper half of the complex plane @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this analyticity property of the characteristic function was in fact exploited much earlier by dyson in his famous paper on the dynamics of a disordered chain  @xcite .    products of random matrices appear naturally in several other problems related to the physics of disordered systems see the monographs @xcite and is still the subject of active research @xcite .",
    "the concept of lyapunov exponent is a very useful tool for analysing a large class of systems with quenched disorder , such as magnetic systems .",
    "a well - known prototype is the ising model in a random magnetic field , where the calculation of the free enegy reduces to analysing an infinite product of @xmath12 matrices ; in this context , the lyapunov exponent is proportional to the free energy per spin .",
    "the group from which the matrices @xmath13 in the product  ( [ product ] ) are drawn varies not only with the physical context but also with the choice of vector basis . in the analysis of the schrdinger equation in a random potential ,",
    "a standard choice is to consider the vector formed by the wave function and its derivative @xmath14 .",
    "as we shall see later on , the evolution of this vector is governed by matrices belonging to the group @xmath15 .",
    "this is the formulation chosen for example in refs .",
    "@xcite and in the present article .",
    "if , instead , one chooses to focus on the scattering aspects of the problem then the wave function , in a region where @xmath16 , is a combination of incoming and outgoing waves @xmath17 . in this setting , it is natural to consider transfer matrices @xmath18 connecting pairs of complex amplitudes @xmath19 .",
    "current conservation then implies that such transfer matrices belong to the group @xmath20 ; see the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite for further details , and ref .",
    "@xcite for a pedagogical presentation and a review of the literature .",
    "interestingly , this scattering formulation provides a natural way of generalising the one - dimensional model which is associated with products of @xmath21 matrices to a quasi - one - dimensional model where the matrices in the product are @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the number of conducting channels .",
    "the localisation problem then involves not just one but rather @xmath23 ( counting multiplicity ) lyapunov exponents @xmath24 . since the pioneering work of dorokhov @xcite ,",
    "whose results were later rediscovered independently by mello , pereyra and kumar  @xcite , this topic has attracted a lot of attention owing to its relevance in the description of weakly disordered metallic wires ; see the review  @xcite .",
    "these early works relied on the so - called _ isotropy assumption _ ,",
    "namely that each elementary slice of disordered metal redistributes the current uniformly amongst the @xmath23 conducting channels .",
    "this assumption produces a set of lyapunov exponents with the behaviour @xmath25 $ ] , where @xmath26 is the dyson index  @xcite . the smallest lyapunov exponent , which scales with the number of channels like @xmath27 , is usually interpreted as the reciprocal of the localisation length .",
    "the ideas of dorokhov and mello _ et al .",
    "_ have since been extended to other symmetry classes of disordered models ; see the review @xcite .",
    "another line of research stimulated by these ideas is to look for models where the isotropy hypothesis may be relaxed @xcite , with the aim of studying the passage from one - dimensional to higher - dimensional localisation . to close these brief remarks on the multichannel case , we point out that the lyapunov exponent is at the heart of numerical studies of localisation that rely on the scaling approach  @xcite .",
    "the present paper revisits the interplay between products of random matrices of @xmath15 and one - dimensional anderson localisation . whereas most of the works cited above emphasise _ discrete _ models obtained by making the tight - binding approximation  @xcite",
    ", we shall focus here on one - dimensional continuous models that make use of the notion of _ point scatterer_. one familiar example is the kronig  penney model @xcite based on delta - scatterers .",
    "we shall see that , by considering a natural generalisation of the concept of point scatterer , we arrive at a useful interpretation of a general product of random matrices as a model of disorder .",
    "we illustrate the fruitfulness of this interpretation by exhibiting concrete instances of the probability measure @xmath6 of the matrices @xmath5 for which the lyapunov exponent may be expressed in terms of special functions .",
    "one of these models is new and has interesting connections with sinai s study of diffusion in a random environment  @xcite .",
    "another justification for focusing on models involving generalised random point scatterers is that far from being special they can on the contrary be mapped onto the _",
    "most general product _ of random matrices in @xmath28 .",
    "hence such models can in principle describe the whole of one - dimensional disordered quantum mechanics .",
    "the remainder of the paper is as follows :  [ scatterersection ] describes the concept of generalised point scatterer , explains how models of disorder may be constructed from them , and how completely general products of matrices may be associated with such models . we then list some known solvable cases . ",
    "[ susysection ] is devoted to the analysis of a _ new _ example where the lyapunov exponent may be expressed in terms of the generalised hypergeometric function .",
    "the paper ends in  [ conclusionsection ] with a discussion of the limitations of the lyapunov exponent as a measure of localisation in disordered systems .",
    "a _ point scatterer _ is the idealised limit of a potential whose action is highly localised .",
    "the most familiar example is the delta - scatterer at a point , say @xmath29 . in the context of the schrdinger equation",
    "@xmath30 this potential vanishes for every @xmath31 and is defined at @xmath32 via the boundary condition @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the strength of the scatterer , i.e. @xmath35 . this delta ",
    "scatterer is generalised by replacing the @xmath36 matrix on the right - hand side by an arbitrary matrix , say @xmath37",
    ". thus @xmath38 conservation of the probability current requires @xmath39 .",
    "if , instead of a single scatterer , we consider a sequence of scatterers placed at the points @xmath40 then , assuming @xmath41 , the solution of the schrdinger equation may be expressed in the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the product ( [ product ] ) with @xmath44 and @xmath45 now , by applying the gram ",
    "schmidt algorithm to the columns , every @xmath36 matrix @xmath46 with unit determinant may be expressed in the form @xmath47 for some real parameters @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this is the iwasawa decomposition of @xmath15 into compact , abelian and nilpotent subgroups .",
    "therefore , by working with point scatterers of the form @xmath51 and taking @xmath52 , we obtain a correspondence between general products of matrices @xmath43 in @xmath15 and the schrdinger equation .",
    "the parameter @xmath53 may be easily reintroduced by simple dimensional analysis .",
    "there are several options in defining a disordered quantum system with point scatterers",
    ". the randomness may be in the strength of the scatterer , i.e. in the matrix @xmath37 , or in the position of the scatterer , i.e. in the coordinate @xmath29 or in _ both _ the strength and the position ; see @xcite where various models are reviewed .",
    "_ we shall henceforth confine our attention to the particular case where the spacing between consecutive scatterers , i.e. the angle @xmath54 , is exponentially distributed : _",
    "@xmath55 where @xmath56 is the mean spacing .",
    "this is the situation that arises when impurities are dropped uniformly on @xmath11 with a mean density @xmath57 .",
    "the equation satisfied by the riccati variable @xmath58 is @xmath59 and @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the linear fractional transformation associated with the matrix @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath62 because the spacing between consecutive scatterers is exponentially distributed , @xmath63 is a markov process , and it was shown by frisch and lloyd @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that the stationary density @xmath64 satisfies @xmath65 + p\\,\\int_{\\text{sl}(2,{\\mathbb r ) } } \\mu_b ( \\d b ) \\left",
    "[ f \\left ( { \\mathcal b}^{-1 } ( z )   \\right ) \\frac{\\d { \\mathcal b}^{-1}(z)}{\\d z } - f(z )   \\right ] = 0 \\label{frischlloydequation}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the probability measure of the random matrix @xmath67 .",
    "the relationship between the riccati variable and the lyapunov exponent is easy to establish at least heuristically .",
    "a completely rigorous treatment would follow the lines of kotani s work @xcite .",
    "given the particular form of the upper - triangular matrix @xmath37 , we have @xmath68 dividing by @xmath69 and letting @xmath70 , we obtain @xmath71 since @xmath72 where the @xmath73 are independent and identically distributed with mean @xmath74 , the law of large numbers implies that @xmath75 then , by the ergodic theorem , @xmath76 almost surely , where @xmath77 is the density of the stationary distribution of the riccati variable .",
    "the upshot is that the lyapunov exponent of the system may in principle be computed by solving the frisch ",
    "lloyd equation ( [ frischlloydequation ] ) for the stationary density , and then performing the integral in formula ( [ riccatiformula ] ) .",
    "it is instructive to compare this method of calculation with that based on furstenberg s theory @xcite .",
    "the concept of direction , through the projective space @xmath78 , plays a prominent part in that theory .",
    "this is due to the fact that the product of matrices grows if and only if the columns of the product tend to align along a common direction . in @xmath79",
    ", a direction may be parametrised by a single number ; let us choose the reciprocal @xmath80 of the slope .",
    "the columns of the product @xmath43 have directions that are random .",
    "when a vector of random direction , say @xmath81 , is multiplied by a random matrix @xmath82 a new vector is produced , whose direction is the random variable @xmath83 we say that the distribution , say @xmath84 , of @xmath81 is _ invariant _ under the action of matrices drawn from @xmath85 if the distributions of the old and the new directions are identical , i.e. @xmath86 in particular , if @xmath84 has a density , say @xmath87 , then this equality in law translates into the following equation for @xmath88 : @xmath89 where , with some abuse of notation , @xmath81 is no longer random . knowing @xmath88 , the lyapunov exponent @xmath8 of the product @xmath43",
    "may then be computed by the formula @xmath90    the calculation of @xmath8 when @xmath46 is of the form ( [ iwasawadecomposition ] ) and @xmath48 is exponentially distributed with mean @xmath74 , independent of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , may then be related to the calculation of @xmath3 in the previous subsection as follows :",
    "1 .   the projective variable @xmath81 is the riccati variable @xmath63 with @xmath91 .",
    "2 .   the furstenberg equation ( [ furstenbergequation ] ) for the invariant density reduces to the frisch ",
    "lloyd equation ( [ frischlloydequation ] ) for the stationary density .",
    "3 .   the furstenberg formula ( [ furstenbergformula ] ) for @xmath8 reduces to formula ( [ riccatiformula ] ) for @xmath3 and @xmath92 the factor @xmath74 is due to the difference between the definitions : whereas ( [ gamma ] ) involves the distance variable @xmath93 , the growth of the matrix product is measured with respect to the index @xmath94 in ( [ gammamu]) @xmath93 and @xmath94 being related by ( [ relationxn ] ) .",
    "there is no systematic method for solving the integro - differential equation ( [ frischlloydequation ] ) , but some solvable cases have been found and are listed in table [ tab : solvablecases ] .",
    "all but the first of these cases have in common that one or both the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the expression for the matrix @xmath67 are exponentially or gamma distributed .",
    "the density of the exponential and gamma distributions satisfies a differential equation with _ constant _ coefficients , and this leads to a trick for reducing ( [ frischlloydequation ] ) to a purely differential form .",
    "this trick will be illustrated in the next section .    here , we consider the simplest example and merely write down the result .",
    "this example consists of taking @xmath95 where @xmath50 is exponentially distributed with mean @xmath96 .",

    "no exact solution is known in the case where _ all three _ parameters @xmath115 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are random .",
    "some insight into the general case may however be gained by considering the continuum limit of an infinitely dense set of point scatterers with vanishingly weak strengths , i.e. @xmath116 this limit was studied very recently in ref .",

    "@xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "finally let us mention a generalisation of the model in another direction : by letting the density of scatterers tend to infinity , it is possible to study certain singular limiting measures for the strength of the scatterers .",
    "such cases may be described in terms of lvy noises and were studied in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we shall restrict our attention to the particular case where the point scatterers are described by transfer matrices of the form @xmath120 as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this corresponds to considering the potential @xmath121 where @xmath119 is a superposition of delta - scatterers @xmath122 a potential of the form ( [ supersymmetricpotential ] ) is said to be _ supersymmetric _ with _ superpotential _ @xmath119 .",
    "hence we shall refer to the point scatterer associated with ( [ eq : susyscatterer ] ) as `` supersymmetric '' .",
    "this case has many interesting features : the corresponding hamiltonian is factorisable and , when the superpotential is deterministic and has the so - called `` shape - invariance '' property , the discrete spectrum may be obtained exactly  @xcite .",
    "the disordered case is of interest in several physical contexts @xcite : in particular , the schrdinger equation can be mapped onto the dirac equation with a random mass a model relevant in several contexts of condensed matter physics ; see the reviews @xcite and the introduction in ref .",

    "the third observation which we alluded to earlier and whose exploitation goes back to the works of nieuwenhuizen @xcite and gjessing and paulsen @xcite is that the integral term appearing in ( [ supersymmetricfrischlloyd ] ) may be eliminated if @xmath128 solves a linear differential equation with ( piecewise ) constant coefficients .    with these points in mind",

    "we set @xmath196 for simplicity .",
    "the @xmath197 limit provides the @xmath198 behaviour , after reintroducing @xmath53 .",
    "we now analyse the integrals in this limit .",
    "there holds  @xcite @xmath199 and , since the whittaker function solves the differential equation @xmath200 we expect the asymptotic form ( [ eq : asympm ] ) to hold for @xmath93 smaller than @xmath201 ( this reasoning assumes that @xmath202 ) .",
    "moreover , we see from the differential equation that the whittaker function is a rapidly oscillating function in the interval @xmath203 $ ] where @xmath204 ; in the limit of interest here we have @xmath205 and @xmath206 .",

    "to close this short review , we point out the limitations of the lyapunov exponent as a means of characterising the localised nature of the spectrum in a disordered system .",
    "a first observation is that the definition ( [ gamma ] ) relies on the assumption of a linear increase of @xmath217 , i.e. on the application of the central limit theorem .",
    "it is however possible to consider models of disorder such that @xmath217 scales as @xmath218 , leading to the phenomenon of sub - localisation ( for @xmath219 ) or super - localisation ( for @xmath220 ) ; this has been studied in , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also references therein ) .",
    "however , this limitation is easily overcome by extending the notion of the lyapunov exponent so that it characterises the typical length over which eigenstates are localised .",
    "another , more serious , limitation of the usefulness of the lyapunov exponent pertains to the possible existence of extended states in one dimension .",
    "this might occur when the disordered potential is correlated @xcite as happens for instance in the dimer model .",
    "it might occur also for symmetry reasons , as is the case for the supersymmetric hamiltonians studied in refs .",
    "@xcite and in section  [ susysection ] ; there , the lyapunov exponent @xmath221 decays to zero in the limit of zero energy . in this respect , it must first be pointed out that the vanishing of the lyapunov exponent is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for delocalisation ; sometimes it only signals sub - localisation . secondly , several works on disordered supersymmetric quantum mechanics have shown that the lyapunov exponent , when it vanishes at the bottom of the spectrum does not provide the relevant length scale characterising the localisation of eigenstates at low non - zero energies .",
    "as mentioned already in section  [ susysection ] , when @xmath222 , the lyapunov exponent vanishes like @xmath223 as @xmath198 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that low - energy eigenstates are localised on a scale commensurate with @xmath224 .",
    "however , the study of the ordered statistics problem @xcite , as well as the analysis of other physical quantities such as the averaged green s function at non coinciding points  @xcite or the boundary - sensitive averaged density of states @xcite , show that eigenstates are localised on a much larger scale , namely @xmath225 .",
