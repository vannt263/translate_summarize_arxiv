    "is found to be more attractive in nature than sbh and ecbh , for the incoming photons with @xmath42 = @xmath35 .",
    "this effect is manifested in the results of the radius of unstable circular orbit , time period for proper time as well as coordinate time and frequency shift for null geodesics .",
    "* the attractive nature of gravitational field of mcbh strengthens as the magnetic charge increases while for ecbh it weakens as electric charge increases .",
    "interestingly as the impact parameter differs from @xmath35 , the gravitational field of mcbh becomes more repulsive than sbh and ecbh .",
    "* cone of avoidance for large distances is found to depend on the respective charges of mcbh and ecbh . at larger distances ,",
    "the cone is narrow and therefore most of the photons can escape from there .",
    "we believe that the result obtained herewith would be useful in the study of gravitational lensing around the charged bhs in the string theory and we intend to report on this issue in near future .",
