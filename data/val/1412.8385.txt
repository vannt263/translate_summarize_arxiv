    "[ fig : cdtotalh ] ( upper panel ) , the total enhancement score for concurrence is positive for all moderate values of @xmath172 .",

    "[ fig : cdtotalj ] and [ fig : cdtotalh ] , we observe that there is a role reversal in the behavior of the total enhancement scores for both concurrence as well as for quantum discord , as we go over from higher to lower values of the anisotropy parameter and when we change the system from spin glass to the random - field @xmath0 model . more specifically , the high-@xmath172 ( low-@xmath172 ) spin glass model behave as the low-@xmath172 ( high-@xmath172 ) random - field @xmath0 model .",
    "we have considered the disorder - induced effects on quantum correlations in two paradigmatic disordered quantum spin models , viz . , the one - dimensional quantum @xmath0 spin glass and random transverse field quantum @xmath0 models .",
    "the disorders are assumed to be quenched . and",
    "the quantum correlations considered are chosen both from the entanglement - separability paradigm as well as from the information - theoretic one .",
    "we find that the systems support the order - from - disorder phenomenon for all the quantum correlations considered at both zero and finite temperatures .",
    "we utilize the concept of enhancement scores to quantify the phenomena .",
    "we find that the scores can actually get enhanced with the introduction of thermal fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , we identify regions in the parameter space , in the post - quenched regime , where self - averaging of the quantum correlations occur , and where the same is absent , and find that the regions are related to the existence of a quantum critical point of the corresponding ordered system .",
    "temperatures close to absolute zero are difficult to achieve in the laboratories . and",
    "therefore , it is important to uncover whether a phenomenon remains robust with the application of thermal fluctuations .",
    "the results of this paper show that moderate temperatures can actually be a better candidate , than zero temperature , for observing the order - from - disorder phenomenon for a broad spectrum of quantum correlations .",
    "the calculations were carried out for two entanglement measures , viz . concurrence and logarithmic negativity , and for two information - theoretic quantum correlation measures , viz .",
    "quantum discord and quantum work - deficit .",
    "the discussions in the paper are however mainly centered around the effects seen for concurrence and quantum discord , as those for logarithmic negativity and quantum work - deficit are broadly similar to their team - mates in the respective camps .",
    "the numbers corresponding to the phenomena reported are seen to have already converged for about 20 ( or lower ) quantum spins , while the calculations are also carried out for up to @xmath2 spins , from which we wish to claim that the phenomena can be observed for finite systems as well as for systems in the thermodynamic limit .",
