    "alexandrov spaces ( with a lower curvature bound ) are synthetic generalizations of riemannian manifolds with a lower ( sectional ) curvature bound .",
    "these spaces arise naturally as gromov - hausdorff limits of sequences of riemannian @xmath3-manifolds with a uniform lower curvature bound or as orbit spaces of isometric group actions on riemannian manifolds with curvature bounded below .",
    "alexandrov spaces have provided a useful tool in the study of smooth and riemannian manifolds ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "since the class of alexandrov spaces properly contains the class of riemannian manifolds , it is natural to ask to what extent riemannian geometry can be generalized to the alexandrov setting .",
    "this problem has received significant attention , especially from an analytic point of view ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) . in this paper",
    "we adopt the viewpoint of transformation groups and focus our attention on isometries of alexandrov spaces , inspired by the fact that in the riemannian case the isometry group has been extensively studied ( see , for example , @xcite and related bibliography ) . in @xcite , fukaya and yamaguchi showed that , as in the case of riemannian manifolds ( see @xcite ) , the isometry group of an alexandrov space is a lie group . by a theorem of van dantzig and van der waerden @xcite ( cf .",
    "theorem  1.1 in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter ii ) ) , the isometry group of a compact alexandrov space is compact .",
    "the presence of an isometric action has been used to obtain further information on the structure of alexandrov spaces . in @xcite ,",
    "berestovski considered finite dimensional homogeneous metric spaces and showed that when they have a lower curvature bound , they are also smooth manifolds ( see also @xcite )",
    ". the structure of alexandrov spaces of cohomogeneity one and their classification in low dimensions appears in @xcite .",
    "the main difference between isometries of alexandrov spaces and isometries of riemannian manifolds is that the former must preserve the metric singularities of the space , i.e. , they must map extremal sets to extremal sets , points with a given type of space of directions to others of the same type , etc .",
    "this not only imposes severe restrictions on the possible isometries but , reciprocally , the existence of isometries usually results in the appearance of additional structure in the singular sets of an alexandrov space .",
    "the present paper explores this theme in several directions , extending various results on isometry groups of riemannian manifolds to the alexandrov case .",
    "we start with section  [ s : prelims ] , where we have collected some background material , along with alexandrov versions of the isotropy lemma and the principal isotropy theorem . in section  [",
    "s : bounds ] we derive an upper bound on the dimension of the isometry group of an alexandrov space of dimension @xmath3 ; this bound is the same as the one for riemannian @xmath3-manifolds ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which is natural , since the existence of singular points in an alexandrov space should mean fewer isometries than in the riemannian case , as pointed out above .",
    "we make this more explicit in section  [ s : rigidity ] , where we prove that the maximal dimension for the isometry group of an alexandrov space is only attained in the riemannian case .",
    "the results in sections  [ s : bounds ] and [ s : rigidity ] were proved for riemannian orbifolds , a special class of alexandrov spaces , in @xcite . in section  [ s : bounds_extremal ]",
    "we bound the dimension of the isometry group of an alexandrov space when there are extremal subsets . in section  [ s : gap_thms ] we show that the gaps in the possible dimensions of the isometry group of a riemannian manifold derived in @xcite also occur for alexandrov spaces . in section",
    "[ s : bdry ] we bound the dimension of the isometry group of an alexandrov space with boundary and classify these spaces up to homeomorphism when the isometry group has maximal dimension .",
    "this extends to the alexandrov setting the work carried out in @xcite for riemannian manifolds with boundary . in our case",
    ", there appears a non - manifold with boundary and isometry group of maximal dimension , namely , the cone over a real projective space .",
    "finally , in section  [ s : sym_spaces ] , we study symmetric alexandrov spaces following previous work of berestovski @xcite .",
    "the first named author thanks the department of mathematics of the universidad autnoma de madrid for its hospitality while part of the work presented in this paper was carried out .",
    "both authors would also like to thank martin weilandt and john harvey for helpful comments on a first version of this paper .",
    "in this section we fix notation and collect some preliminary material that we will use in the rest of the paper . for the sake of completeness , in subsection  [ ss : pithm ]",
    "we prove the isotropy lemma and the principal orbit theorem for isometric lie actions on alexandrov spaces .",
    "these results are well known in the smooth case ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "recall that a length space @xmath4 of finite ( hausdorff ) dimension is an _ alexandrov space _",
    "( with curvature bounded below ) if it has curvature bounded from below in the triangle comparison sense .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for the main definitions and theorems pertaining to these spaces .",
    "further developments can be found in @xcite .",
    "the primary source of technical difficulties in the study of alexandrov spaces is usually due to the presence of singularities .",
    "however , given an alexandrov space @xmath0 , work of otsu and shioya @xcite , and of perelman @xcite , allows one to introduce a @xmath5 structure on a large open subset of @xmath0 . more precisely ,",
    "call a point @xmath6 _ regular _ if its space of directions @xmath7 is isometric to the unit round sphere @xmath8 ; otherwise , @xmath9 is called _",
    "singular_. we will denote the set of regular points of @xmath0 by @xmath10 , and the set of singular points by @xmath11 , so that @xmath12 . the set @xmath10 is the intersection of countably many open and dense subsets of @xmath0 and is dense in @xmath0 ; any regular point has an open neighborhood @xmath13 and a map @xmath14 that is a homeomorphism onto its image ( cf .",
    "in fact , there have been improvements on the smoothness of the structure ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , although we shall omit them here , since they are not necessary in what follows . proving some of our statements in the riemannian case requires using the differential of a map .",
    "fortunately , this can also be defined for alexandrov spaces ( see , for example , @xcite for the more general statements ) .    given an alexandrov space @xmath0 , we will denote its isometry group by @xmath1 .",

    ", we will denote the orbit space of the action @xmath25 by @xmath26 , and a point in @xmath26 will be denoted by @xmath27 , corresponding to the orbit @xmath19 .",
    "a useful fact about @xmath28 is that it is a _ submetry _ , and as such admits horizontal lifts of geodesics from @xmath26 to @xmath0 ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "we will also use the fact that the natural action of @xmath1 on @xmath0 has closed orbits ( see , for instance , @xcite , section i.4 ) .",
    "we will assume all actions to be effective and all alexandrov spaces to be connected .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for further background on the theory of transformation groups .",
    "we now enunciate and prove alexandrov versions of the isotropy lemma and the principal orbit theorem .",
    "the main ideas follow closely lemma  1.3 and theorem  1.4 in @xcite , which are originally stated for the smooth case .",

    "then there is a unique maximal orbit type and the orbits with maximal orbit type , the so - called principal orbits , form an open and dense subset of @xmath0 .        among the isotropy groups of least dimension ,",

    "since any point @xmath56 is the endpoint of a minimal geodesic between orbits starting at the orbit through @xmath48 , it is clear that @xmath55 is dense in @xmath0 .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath55 is open .",

    "the following proposition shows that , if the isometry group of an alexandrov space with boundary has maximal dimension , then the boundary is , in fact , a riemannian manifold .",
    "let @xmath0 be an @xmath3-dimensional alexandrov space with non - empty boundary @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath190 , then each connected component of @xmath2 , with its induced intrinsic metric , is isometric to one of the space forms in theorem  [ t : rigidity ] .",
    "let @xmath186 and fix @xmath185 .",
    "it follows from the proof of theorem  [ t : dim_bound_bdry ] that , since the dimension of @xmath29 is maximal , the dimension of the orbit @xmath191 is @xmath184 and the dimension of the isotropy group @xmath20 is maximal . by the theorem of invariance of domain ,",
    "the orbit @xmath19 is open and , since it is also closed , it must correspond to a connected component @xmath192 of @xmath2 .",
    "it follows from theorem  7 in @xcite that @xmath192 is a finsler homogeneous manifold .",
    "since @xmath20 is of maximal dimension , the unit vectors at each point tangent to the boundary must be a round sphere .",
    "thus , the finsler structure is riemannian and the conclusion follows from kobayashi s rigidity result ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.1 ) .",
    "we conclude this section with the topological classification of alexandrov spaces with boundary and isometry group of maximal dimension .",
    "[ t : rigidity_bdry ] let @xmath0 be an @xmath3-dimensional alexandrov space with non - empty boundary @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath190 , then the following hold :    1 .",
    "if @xmath0 is compact , then it is homeomorphic to one of the following spaces : 1 .   a closed @xmath3-dimensional unit ball in @xmath126 .",
    "2 .   a cylinder @xmath193 $ ] or @xmath194 $ ] .",
    "3 .   @xmath195 with a small open disc removed .",
    "4 .   a cone over @xmath196 . + 2 .",
    "if @xmath0 is non - compact and @xmath2 has a compact component , then @xmath0 is homeomorphic to a half open cylinder @xmath197 or @xmath198 .",
    "if @xmath0 is non - compact and every component of @xmath2 is non - compact , then @xmath0 is homeomorphic to @xmath199 or to @xmath200 $ ] .    the only new space in theorem  [ t : rigidity_bdry ] not appearing in the riemannian case is the cone over @xmath196 .    by looking at level sets of the distance function to a component of @xmath2 ,",
    "we observe , as in @xcite , that the action of @xmath1 on @xmath0 is of cohomogeneity one .",
    "thus the orbit space @xmath201 is homeomorphic to either @xmath202 $ ] or @xmath203 .    in case",
    "( 1 ) , the orbit space @xmath26 is homeomorphic to @xmath202 $ ] .",
    "the isotropy at the endpoint of @xmath204 $ ] corresponding to a component of @xmath2 is @xmath205 or @xmath206 , while the isotropy at the orbits corresponding to points in the interior of @xmath202 $ ] is @xmath205 .",
    "the isotropy at the other endpoint must contain @xmath205 and thus can only be @xmath206 or @xmath207 , yielding the desired spaces .",
    "the only case not appearing in @xcite is the one in which the points @xmath208 and @xmath209 in @xmath210 $ ] have , respectively , isotropy @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "this corresponds to the cone over @xmath196 .",
    "cases ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) follow as in @xcite .    since the action of @xmath1 on @xmath0 is of cohomogeneity one , the metric of @xmath0 is quite restricted .",
    "this idea was examined for smooth manifolds in @xcite , where the authors proved that the metrics were warped over an interval .",
    "it is natural to expect that similar versions can be given for alexandrov spaces , although with certain modification on the warping function to reflect the possible lack of smoothness .",
    "the results in @xcite can be used in this context to show that the metric is warped over an interval with a semiconcave function as warping factor .",
    "we have omitted the details for concision s sake , since they can be easily completed .",
    "following @xcite , we say that an alexandrov space @xmath0 is a _ locally _ _ ( uniformly ) _ _ symmetric space _ if for every @xmath6 there is a neighborhood @xmath211 of @xmath9 and a number @xmath212 such that for all @xmath213 , the ball @xmath214 admits an isometric involution with @xmath113 as its only fixed point .",
    "the space is _ symmetric _ if the involutions extend to all the space . in the above reference",
    ", berestovski shows that for simply connected @xmath29-spaces , locally symmetric and symmetric are equivalent conditions .",
    "however , the situation is different for alexandrov spaces , as we show in the following example .",
    "[ e : lsym_notsym ] consider the double disk @xmath0 .",
    "it is locally symmetric , simply connected and it is not symmetric .",
    "in fact , geodesic involutions do not extend to isometries of the whole space for points different of the centers of the disks , or of the glued boundary .",
    "more generally , if @xmath215 is a geodesic ball in a symmetric space , then @xmath216 is locally symmetric but not symmetric .    any regular polyhedral surface with an even number of edges meeting at each vertex , for example",
    ", the surface of an icosahedron , is locally symmetric but not symmetric , and is not the double of a geodesic ball in a symmetric space .",
    "the same holds for the double of a right cone over a circle of length less than @xmath217 .",
    "thus , example  [ e : lsym_notsym ] does not exhaust all the possibilities for locally symmetric alexandrov spaces that are not symmetric .",
    "the abundance of examples makes it difficult to give a general structure result for these spaces .",
    "the double of the half - disc @xmath218 in @xmath219 is a non - negatively curved alexandrov space that is neither symmetric nor locally symmetric , as can be seen by considering its vertex points .",
    "this shows that not every double of a convex domain in a symmetric space is locally symmetric .",
    "let @xmath148 be an @xmath3-dimensional alexandrov space .",
    "let @xmath220 be a regular point , so that @xmath7 is isometric to the unit round sphere @xmath111 .",
    "let @xmath221 be the isometric involution at @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath222 . since @xmath148 is symmetric , @xmath223 .",
    "we will now show that @xmath224 exists and agrees with @xmath225 .",
    "consider the sequence of isometries @xmath226 letting @xmath227 we get an isometry @xmath228 and @xmath229 .",
    "observe that @xmath230 is @xmath225 , since @xmath231 has no fixed points away from the origin and it is an orthogonal involution .",
    "let @xmath232 and let @xmath233\\rightarrow x$ ] be a geodesic joining @xmath234 to @xmath235 .",
    "observe that the image of @xmath159 is contained in @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath236 .",
    "since @xmath237 , @xmath238 sends @xmath239 to @xmath240 , we have that @xmath241 goes to @xmath242 .",
    "it follows that @xmath238 preserves such geodesics , so @xmath243 acts transitively on @xmath10 .",
    "since @xmath1 has the compact - open topology , the orbit @xmath244 , @xmath151 , is closed and , containing all of @xmath245 , needs to be @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , @xmath1 acts transitively and @xmath0 is a homogeneous space . a result by berestovski ( cf .",
