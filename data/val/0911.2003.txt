    "we present new results from this search : macsj1149.5@xmath02223 ( hereafter macsj1149 ; 11:49:34.3 @xmath022:23:42.5 [ j2000 ] ) at @xmath17 , one of a complete subsample of 12 macs clusters at @xmath18 @xcite .    in  [ sec : obs ] we describe the data ; modeling and results are presented in  [ sec : results ] , and summarized in ",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "we assume @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ; at @xmath17 @xmath22 corresponds to @xmath23 .",
    "all uncertainties and upper / lower limits are stated and/or plotted at @xmath24 confidence .",
    "macsj1149 was observed on 2004 , april 22 with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on - board the _ _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ _ for @xmath25 and @xmath26 through the f555w and f814w filters respectively ( go :  9722 , pi :  ebeling ) .",
    "these data were reduced using standard multidrizzle routines onto a @xmath27 grid .",
    "the reduced data reveal a striking multiply - imaged disk galaxy comprising three tangential images ( a1.1/2/3 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : arcs ] ) , and an additional image ( a1.4 ) likely caused by part of the galaxy s disk lying adjacent to the radial caustic in the source plane .",
    "a blue image pair ( a2.1/2 ) also lies @xmath28 south east of the bcg , with its counter - image ( a2.3 ) @xmath29 to the south west .",
    "a further five triply - imaged galaxies are identified based on their distinctive colors and morphologies : a3.1/2/3 and a4.1/2/3 both lie between the bcg and a dense group of cluster ellipticals @xmath30 to the nnw ; a5 is embedded in the halo of a cluster elliptical in the same group to the nnw of the bcg ; a6.1/2/3 and a7.1/2/3 surround a bright elliptical galaxy @xmath31 north of the bcg .",
    "numerous other faint blue background galaxies can be seen through the cluster core , however the lack of concordant colors and morphologies preclude a reliable identification of them as being multiply - imaged at this time .    macsj1149 was observed with the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the keck - i 10-m telescope on 2004 , march 28 and 2005 , march 6 employing a single multi slit mask per run . in 2004 , we used the 400/3400 grism , d560 dichroic , and 400/8500 grating centered at @xmath32 . a total integration of @xmath33 yielded the redshift of a2.1/2 as @xmath34 via detection of lyman-@xmath35 in emission at @xmath36 ( a2.3",
    "was also confirmed at @xmath37 in 2005 ) .",
    "this redshift was used to constrain a preliminary lens model from which the redshift of a1 was predicted to be @xmath38 . in march 2005",
    "we centered the 831/8200 grating at @xmath39 to search for redshifted [ oii ] from a1 .",
    "the resulting 1-hr spectrum resolved the [ oii ] doublet at @xmath40 in all three of a1.1/2/3 , placing this galaxy at @xmath41 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spect ] ) .",
    "the 2004 observations also identified a3.1 and a3.2 at @xmath42 via detection of the lyman break , plus interstellar silicon and carbon absorption lines .",
    "to gain an initial view of the structure of the cluster mass distribution we selected galaxies with spectroscopic or photometric redshifts between @xmath43 from ma et al.s ( in prep . ; see also @xcite @xcite ) catalog .",
    "this catalog is based on spectroscopic observations with deimos on keck ii ( yielding 217 cluster members ) , plus panoramic @xmath44-band imaging with suprime - cam on the subaru 8.2-m telescope and similar @xmath45-band data from megaprime on the cfht 3.6-m telescope .",
    "the resulting luminosity density map is adaptively smoothed to @xmath46 significance using asmooth @xcite and is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : arcs ] .",
    "it reveals five luminous structures ( labeled a ",
    "e ) , suggesting that the underlying distribution of dark matter may be similarly complicated .",
    "our goal is to constrain the shape of the mass distribution in the cluster core .",
    "we therefore adopt stringent criteria for the inclusion of multiple image systems as constraints on our lens model to guard against detection of spurious features in the mass distribution . to be included , a galaxy or morphological feature within a galaxy",
    "must be identified a minimum of three times , and the morphological and color match between the multiple images of the galaxy / feature must be unambiguous .",
    "ten morphological features of a1 satisfy these criteria , of which eight are seen in all of a1.1 , a1.2 and a1.3 , and two have also been identified in a1.4 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : arcs ] ) .",
    "these 10 features lie generally away from the portions of the disk that are affected by the cluster ellipticals marked with a black cross in fig .",
    "[ fig : arcs ] . note that we interpret all of the morphological features south - east of the central bulge ( feature # 2 ) of a1.2 as being part of the disk of that image , distorted by the neighboring cluster elliptical .",
    "the three images each of a2 , a3 , a4 , a6 , and a7 are also used as model constraints , with the unknown redshifts of the latter three being free parameters in the lens model .",
    "these systems total @xmath47 model constraints .",
    "the mass distribution was initially parameterized as a superposition of 21 cluster galaxies ( @xmath48 ) , plus 5 cluster - scale components ( hereafter referred to as halos ) centered on the brightest galaxy in each of the light concentrations marked in fig .",
    "[ fig : arcs ] .",
    "all galaxies and halos were parameterized as smoothly - truncated pseudo - isothermal elliptical mass distributions ( piemd ) following @xcite .",
    "the position , ellipticity , and orientation of the galaxies were matched to those of their light , and the velocity dispersions , core and cut - off radii were scaled with their luminosity , adopting the best - fit parameters for an @xmath4 galaxy obtained by @xcite .",
    "we imposed a prior of @xmath49 on the redshifts of a4 , a6 , and a7 , the upper limit coming from the absence of an obvious lyman break within / blueward of f555w for all three galaxies .",
    "in total the model has @xmath50 free parameters .",
    "the model was fitted to the data using the bayesian mcmc sampler within lenstool v6.5 @xcite , using a positional uncertainty of @xmath51 in the image plane .",
    "the image - plane @xmath52 of the best - fitting model was @xmath53 , and the average root mean square ( rms ) deviation of images predicted by this model from the observed positions is @xmath54 .",
    "halo a has a velocity dispersion of @xmath55 , and halos b , d , and e have @xmath56 .",
    "however halo c has a @xmath24 confidence upper limit of @xmath57 , implying that the galaxies associated with halo c may not be embedded in an extended dark matter halo .    to explore this",
    "further we re - fitted the model excluding halo c , again obtaining @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we then used the bayesian evidence , i.e.  the probability of the model given the data and the choice of the piemd paramaterization , to determine whether the additional complexity of the 5 halo model is justified by the data .",
    "the result is summarized in table  [ tab : models ]  the probability of the 4 halo model exceeds that of the 5 halo model by a factor of @xmath58 .",
    "we therefore conclude that halo c is not justified by the data .",
    "we also test whether even simpler models offer more probable descriptions of the data  results are listed in table  [ tab : models ] . in summary ,",
    "models with @xmath59 halos are less probable than the four halo model by @xmath60 orders of magnitude .",
    "we therefore adopt the four halo model as our fiducial model , and list its parameters in table  [ tab : models ] .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      we use the fiducial model to compute the projected mass within a projected radius of @xmath61 and the fraction of that mass residing in the groups and the cluster galaxy population , obtaining a mass of @xmath62 and a substructure fraction of @xmath63 .",
    "macsj1149 therefore has a mass and substructure fraction comparable with the most disturbed of the clusters studied at @xmath64 by @xcite and @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "however despite these global similarities , we note that none of the lower redshift clusters contained three group - scale halos .",
    "macsj1149 is therefore the most complex strong - lensing cluster studied to date .    despite having similar velocity dispersions ,",
    "the three group - scale halos have different optical morphologies , suggesting that they may have suffered different infall histories .",
    "luminous structure b appears as an extended finger pointing se from the cluster center ( fig .",
    "[ fig : arcs ] ) dominated by two bright elliptical galaxies : one on which we placed halo b in the lens model , and a second one @xmath65 further se .",
    "luminous structure d comprises a dense group of galaxies , none of which dominate the optical luminosity . finally , luminous structure e is dominated by a single bright elliptical galaxy . despite our ability to find an acceptable fit",
    ", we therefore expect that improvements to the strong - lensing constraints , especially spectroscopic redshifts of a6 and a7 will help to constrain in more detail the structure of these `` groups '' , aided by more flexible modeling schemes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : massmap ] we show the contours of luminosity density (  [ sec : lum ] ) , isomass density (  [ sec : model ] ; table  [ tab : models ] ) , and x - ray surface brightness from _ chandra _ observations @xcite . by construction",
    "the mass contours agree well with the luminosity density contours , except that luminous structure c is not embedded in an extended dark matter halo .",
    "the peak of the x - ray emission is offset from the bcg by @xmath66 , and the overall x - ray morphology is elongated in a nw ",
    "se direction , i.e.  in the same direction as the mass and light contours .",
    "macsj1149 therefore follows the well - established trend for x - ray luminous clusters with multi - modal mass distributions to have an x - ray morphology that is not centered on the bcg @xcite , adding weight to the conclusion that this is a merging cluster .",
    "we use the fiducial lens model ( table  [ tab : models ] ) to calculate the intrinsic properties of the multiply - imaged disk - galaxy at @xmath2 .",
    "a1.1 , a1.2 , a1.3 , and a1.4 are magnified gravitationally by @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 respectively , with a typical uncertainty of @xmath71 .",
    "the unlensed apparent magnitude of this galaxy in the @xmath72-band is therefore @xmath73 , corresponding to @xmath5 in the rest frame .",
    "a1 is therefore comparable with @xmath4 galaxies in the local universe @xcite , the faintest of the lensed disk galaxies in @xcite s ( @xcite ) study of the tully fisher relation at @xmath74 , and the lensed sa galaxy at @xmath75 studied by @xcite . in contrast , it is @xmath76 fainter than previously studied unlensed disk galaxies at similar redshifts @xcite .",
    "many of these galaxies are bulge dominated systems ; in contrast , a1 is not dominated by its bulge , with a rest frame b - band bulge - to - total ratio of @xmath77 .",
    "we also estimate the star formation rate from the observed @xmath78-band flux  adopting the calibration of @xcite , we obtain a global star formation rate of @xmath7 .",
    "individual hii regions in local galaxies typically span @xmath79 @xcite , which translates to @xmath80 at @xmath2 .",
    "the lens magnification of @xmath67 suffered by a1.1 boosts the angular scale of hii regions in this galaxy to @xmath81 , bringing them within reach of instruments such as osiris on keck and nifs on gemini north .",
    "this galaxy therefore offers a unique opportunity to study the distribution of star formation , chemical abundance gradients , and even the physics of individual star - forming regions at a look back time of @xmath82 at a level of detail similar to that achieved at @xmath83 .",
    "we show the density profile from our fiducial model in fig .",
    "[ fig : prof ] . parameterizing the profile as @xmath84",
    ", we obtain @xmath85 in the radial range @xmath86 . during peer review of this letter , (",
    "* hereafter zb ) claimed that the density profile of macsj1149 is flat and critically convergent ( @xmath87 ) out to @xmath88 , equivalent to @xmath89 .",
    "inspection of zb s fig .",
    "5 reveals that the average slope of their profile at @xmath86 is @xmath90 ( @xmath91 confidence , assuming their error bars are @xmath92 ) .",
    "we therefore rule out zb s model at @xmath93 confidence ; a flat model ( i.e.  @xmath94 ) within this radial range is ruled out at @xmath95 .",
    "the two main differences between zb s model and ours are the following .",
    "first , zb s multiple - image interpretation is different from ours : they claim to find a fifth image of a1 , plus six additional multiple - image systems ( their 510 ) , all of which do not pass the strict criteria described in  [ sec : model ] ; in addition , zb do not identify our systems a6 and a7 .",
    "second , zb s analysis contains no spectroscopic or photometric redshift information for their multiple images and , more importantly , zb do not treat these unknown redshifts as free parameters in their model  their model contains just 6 free parameters , which describe the cluster mass distribution .",
    "we attempt to reproduce zb s flat profile by fitting a model to all of their multiple image identifications , including the putative fifth image of system a1 ( marked by a black circle in the a1.2 panel of fig .",
    "1 ) . we treat the redshifts of all multiple images as free parameters .",
    "the resulting best - fit `` zb - constrained '' model has an image - plane rms of @xmath96 , i.e.  more than twice that of our fiducial model , dominated by the fifth image of a1 and zb s systems 510 . the density profile associated with this model",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : prof ] and is in fact _ steeper _ than ours . however , once redshifts are no longer included as free parameters in the fit , but fixed at values that differ , to varying degrees , from the true , measured values , the sensitivity of the density profile to a chosen set of fixed redshift values becomes apparent .",
    "we demonstrate this by setting the redshifts of a1 , a2 , a3 , and a4 to @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath99 , i.e.  to values that are permitted by the model uncertainties but are in fact not the measured ones .",
    "the density profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig : prof ] ) resulting from these erroneous assumptions is nearly flat , with @xmath100 .",
    "we conclude that zb s claim of a flat density profile is highly sensitive to the details of the method by which they chose to assign fixed redshifts to multiple - image systems .",
    "these problems may have been compounded by mis - identification of some multiple image systems .",
    "we have presented new _ hst_/acs and keck i / lris observations of macsj1149 , a massive x - ray selected galaxy cluster at @xmath17 discovered in the massive cluster survey .",
    "these data reveal seven robustly identified multiply - imaged galaxies , three of which we have confirmed spectroscopically .",
    "the most spectacular system is a multiply - imaged face - on disk galaxy at @xmath2 that we identify as an @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) late - type ( @xmath6 ) galaxy with an ongoing star formation rate of @xmath7 ; the brightest images of this galaxy are magnified by @xmath67 .",
    "future observations using integral field spectrographs should probe its properties in exquisite detail , thanks to the combination of lens magnification and fortuitous viewing angle .",
    "we use the positions and redshifts of robustly identified multiply - imaged galaxies to constrain a detailed model of the mass and structure of the cluster core .",
    "our fiducial model contains the main cluster halo plus three group - scale halos ; the probability of a model this complex , relative to less complex models is @xmath101 where @xmath9 is the number of cluster / group - scale halos .",
    "we measure the mass and fraction of mass residing in substructures to be @xmath102 and @xmath63 respectively . in summary",
    ", macsj1149 is the most complex strong - lensing cluster core studied to date , its relatively dis - assembled nature being qualitatively consistent with the expectation that clusters at high redshifts are on average less mature than those at lower redshifts",
    ". a more complete view will emerge from our analysis of the full sample of macs clusters at @xmath18 ( smith et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "we also obtain a power law density profile slope of @xmath103 ( @xmath24 confidence error bars ) on scales of @xmath86 , thereby ruling out density profile slopes as flat as those recently proposed by @xcite at @xmath13 confidence . in summary ,",
    "@xcite s result can be explained by an absence of multiple - image redshifts of any form in their study , and by them not treating the unknown redshifts as free parameters in their model .",
    "these issues are probably compounded by them mis - identifying some multiple - image systems .",
    "overall , this underlines the critical importance of measuring spectroscopic redshifts of multiply - imaged galaxies for reliable lens models of strong lensing clusters .",
