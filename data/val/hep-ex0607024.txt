    "neutrinos are particles that interact only weakly and this gives them a somewhat special character . the cross section for neutrino interactions with matter , for the neutrino energies attainable with accelerators and for normal matter densities ,",
    "is extremely small , making them enormously penetrating . as a consequence neutrino experiments are difficult , requiring very intense beams and/or very large targets .",
    "since recently we know of another peculiar property of the neutrinos : their mass is extremely small compared to that of the other elementary particles .",
    "experiments with accelerator neutrinos have played an important role in the past .",
    "the discovery of the second and third neutrinos , the discovery of neutral currents in the seventies , and the study of deep inelastic neutrino nucleon scattering , which shed light on the nucleon structure complementary to the information obtained from deep inelastic charged lepton ( electron or muon ) collisions with nucleons , are some of the highlights of accelerator neutrino physics .",
    "the clear evidence for neutrino oscillations first shown by the super - kamiokande collaboration in 1998 , with the consequence that the neutrinos have a finite mass , has now produced a renaissance of accelerator neutrinos experiments , with a focus on understanding the oscillation phenomenon .    in this lecture a brief account is given of the physics of oscillations and of the experiments that support it , before turning to the current and foreseen oscillation experiments at accelerators .",
    "for the studies of neutrino physics at non - accelerators refer to the lectures of d. wark in this conference .",
    "in the sm there are 3 lepton families , each containing a charged lepton and a neutrino .",
    "neutrinos are massless particles and each family lepton number ( as well as global lepton number ) is conserved .",
    "the neutrino has three states ( weak eigenstates ) : @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . by definition",
    "these are the states that couple to the @xmath3 together with the corresponding charged lepton in charged - current weak interactions .",
    "these assumptions , in particular the massless assumption , were built up from experiment .",
    "if neutrinos have mass , the mass eigenstates do not need to be the same as the weak eigenstates .",
    "the mass eigenstates are usually denoted by @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the situation is similar to that of the quarks , where the weak eigenstates are the cabbibo - rotated mass states that constitute the hadrons .",
    "the difference is that in the neutrino case we do not have a direct access to the mass eigenstates , since we produce and detect neutrinos through the weak interaction , and therefore we project them into pure weak eigenstates when we observe them .    if mass and weak states are not the same they are related by a transformation @xmath7 where @xmath8 stands for charged lepton type @xmath9 , @xmath10 or @xmath11 , and @xmath12 refers to mass state .",
    "if there are only three mass states , then @xmath13 is a @xmath14 unitary matrix .",
    "here we consider only this case for the sake of simplicity in the explanation of the oscillations .",
    "all the experimental data can be explained with three mass states , except for the results of the lsnd experiment @xcite ( see below ) . for an excellent review of neutrino oscillations",
    "see article of b. kayser @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14 @xmath13 matrix can be written as follows @xmath15 this mixing matrix is usually called the maki - nakagawa - sakata - pontecorvo ( mnsp ) matrix @xcite , analogous to the ckm matrix for the quarks .    to understand what are neutrino oscillations",
    "let us assume that a neutrino is produced at @xmath16 in a pure weak eigenstate , @xmath17 .",
    "this state is a mixture of mass eigenstates determined by the mixing matrix . as space and time",
    "change each of the mass eigenstates , @xmath18 , all produced with the same energy , e , evolves acquiring a phase @xmath19 , different for the 3 mass eigenstates due to their different masses ( e.g. different momenta ) . when the neutrino is detected through a weak interaction , this quantum - mechanical mixture",
    "is projected again into a weak eigenstate , @xmath20 , which can be different from @xmath17 .",
    "we say that the neutrino has oscillated from one flavor to another . clearly the lepton family number is not conserved in this process .",
    "with some algebra one can compute the probability for the transition @xmath17 to @xmath20 : @xmath21 \\nonumber \\\\ & + 2 & \\sum_{i > j } \\im ( u^*_{\\alpha i } u_{\\beta i } u_{\\alpha j } u^*_{\\beta j } ) \\sin [ 2.54 \\delta m^2_{ij } ( l / e ) ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above expression @xmath22 is measured in @xmath23 , @xmath24 , the distance from the source to the detector , is measured in @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , the neutrino energy , is measured in @xmath27 .",
    "these equations simplify considerably if certain conditions are met .",
    "for example one of the mass splittings , @xmath28 , can be very different from the other .",
    "if @xmath26 and @xmath24 in a given experiment are such that @xmath29 then only the corresponding term is relevant in the above expression .",
    "the resulting formulae are like those that one would obtain assuming that only two generations participate in the oscillation .",
    "the corresponding situation is called a  quasi - two - neutrino oscillation \" .",
    "it can also be that only two mass states couple significantly to the flavor partner of the neutrino being studied . in that case",
    "the equations also become quasi - two - neutrino oscillations .",
    "nature seems to be kind enough to have chosen these situations , the first in the case of atmospheric neutrinos the second in solar neutrinos .",
    "+      the first clear signature for neutrino oscillations was reported by the super - kamikande collaboration at the time of the 1998 international neutrino conference in the study of atmospheric neutrinos @xcite .",
    "these are neutrinos produced by the interaction of the primary cosmic rays , high in the earth atmosphere .",
    "the charged pions produced in the primary cosmic - ray collisions with the nuclei in the atmosphere decay into muons and muon - neutrinos ( or antineutrinos ) .",
    "most of the secondary negative ( positive )",
    "muons also decay into an electron ( positron ) , an electron antineutrino ( neutrino ) and a muon neutrino ( antineutrino ) .",
    "the ratio of muon neutrinos to electron neutrinos arriving at the surface should then be about 2 . some of the muons do not decay before they reach the earth surface so the ratio should be slightly larger than 2 , an effect that grows with the energy of the primary muon ( and thus of the resulting neutrinos ) .   + the super - kamiokande detector is a huge , 50 kts , tank of water and it is located at 1 km depth at the kamioka mine in western japan @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "electron and muon neutrino interactions are detected when they interact through the charged current , giving an electron or muon crossing the detector or stopping in the water .",
    "the corresponding track produces a ring of cherenkov light that is detected by the photomultipliers surrounding the detector volume . with this method",
    "one can measure the direction of the particle ( electron or muon ) which is strongly correlated with the direction of the incoming neutrino , and its energy @xcite .",
    "the ratio of electron to muon neutrinos reported by superkamiokande was closer to 1 , instead of 2 , but the most striking result was the zenith angle dependence of the high energy muon neutrinos shown in figure 1 for the latest super - kamiokande data @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the zenith angle is related to the distance traveled by the neutrinos before reaching the detector .",
    "zenith angle equal 0 ( cosine equal 1 ) means that the neutrinos enter the detector from the top , having been produced between 10 and 20 kilometers in the atmosphere , above the detector , while zenith angle equal @xmath30 implies neutrinos produced in the antipodes of the detector , at near 13,000 kilometers . from these plots",
    "one clearly sees that the expected number of neutrinos decreases with distance .",
    "notice that the effect is present for muon neutrinos but not for electron neutrinos .",
    "number of electron and muon atmospheric neutrinos detected in super - kamiokande as a function of the zenith angle , for various types of events .",
    "cos@xmath31 corresponds to neutrinos coming from above ( near ) the detector while cos@xmath32 corresponds to neutrinos coming from below ( far ) .",
    "the rectangles are the expected number of events in the absence of oscillations while the solid curve is the expectation for the best fit to the data including oscillations .",
    "the plots are from reference @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",height=460 ]   number of electron and muon atmospheric neutrinos detected in super - kamiokande as a function of the zenith angle , for various types of events .",
    "cos@xmath31 corresponds to neutrinos coming from above ( near ) the detector while cos@xmath32 corresponds to neutrinos coming from below ( far ) .",
    "the rectangles are the expected number of events in the absence of oscillations while the solid curve is the expectation for the best fit to the data including oscillations .",
    "the plots are from reference @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",height=460 ]    the results can be explained assuming that atmospheric muon neutrinos oscillate into tau neutrinos , which produce a tau in their interactions and can not be easily identified in super - kamiokande . that the oscillation is predominantly into tau neutrinos and not electron neutrinos",
    "is derived from the fact that there is no anomaly on the electron neutrinos seen also in super - kamiokande .",
    "( the tau neutrinos interact producing a tau particle that decays promptly .",
    "these events either have too many cherenkov rings from charged particles coming from the tau decay or can not be distinguished from interactions of electron or muon neutrinos .",
    "an attempt to extract a tau neutrino signal is described in @xcite ) .",
    "the oscillation parameters are such that the effect is more pronounced for those coming from long distances , order the earth diameter , for the energies typical of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "in fact , atmospheric neutrino oscillations can be described by the two - neutrino approximation assuming maximal mixing and one mass difference , called @xmath33 , with a value which until recently was mostly determined by the results of this experiment ( see below ) .      if the first clear signature of neutrino oscillations appeared in atmospheric neutrinos in 1998 , the first hint for oscillations came from an experiment that started in the mid sixties by r. davis jr .",
    "and collaborators with the aim of measuring the neutrinos originating in the sun .",
    "this experiment reported a deficit @xcite in the solar neutrino flux with respect to the expectations from a solar model calculation of j. bahcall and collaborators , published in the same issue of the physical review letters in 1968 @xcite .",
    "as for any other star , electron neutrinos are produced in the sun due to the fusion reactions taking place deep in the star interior , as first written down by hans bethe in the thirties @xcite .",
    "most of the neutrinos are produced in the fusion of two hydrogen nuclei ( two protons ) into helium , giving neutrinos with an energy lower than 0.42 mev , which is below the detection threshold of most experiments .",
    "but there are other neutrino producing reactions taking place in the sun , giving neutrinos with a rich spectrum of energies . after the pioneer experiment many others have followed , using different techniques , sensible to different parts of the solar neutrino spectrum .",
    "in particular there are neutrinos produced in the beta decay of @xmath34 which have and end point energy of 15 mev and are the best measured ( again the reader is referred to the lecture by d. wark in this conference ) .",
    "almost all the solar neutrino experiments reported a measured electron neutrino flux which was substantially below the expectations of the solar model , as low as 30% depending on the energy @xcite .",
    "the interpretation was that the solar electron neutrinos oscillate into muon or tau neutrinos which are below threshold for the charged current interaction , in which a muon or a tau , respectively , has to be produced .",
    "obviously the way to avoid this detection problem is to design an experiment able to detect the neutral current interaction , which should take place for the three neutrino species .",
    "this is precisely what the sno experiment has achieved .",
    "the sno detector @xcite consists on a tank of 1 kt ( kiloton ) of heavy water , @xmath35 , shielded by about 7.5 kt of ultra - pure ordinary water .",
    "electron neutrinos can interact in sno by the charged current ( cc ) reaction that transforms the neutron of the deuterium nucleus into a proton @xmath36 the electron is observed by the cherenkov light and its direction is strongly correlated with that of the neutrino .",
    "but what is unique to sno is that the three types of neutrinos can interact with the deuterium via the neutral current reaction ( nc ) @xmath37 the threshold energy for this reaction is 2.22 mev , the binding energy of the deuterium nucleus .",
    "this reaction is detected through the observation of the neutron . in the first phase of sno the neutron was detected when it was captured by the deuteron emitting a 6.25 mev @xmath38-ray . in a second phase of the experiments",
    "2 tons of a salt , @xmath39 , were added to the heavy water and the neutron was detected following its capture by the @xmath40 nucleus , which produces a @xmath38 cascade .",
    "the efficiency of detecting the neutron is three times higher with the salt added to the water . to be able to detect above background the single electron of the cc events , or the light due to the single neutron capture in the nc events , requires an extremely high purity of the detector elements .",
    "a third reaction is the elastic scattering ( es ) of neutrinos with electrons ( this is the reaction also measured in superkamiokande ) @xmath41 this reaction occurs in principle for the three neutrino types ( through the neutral current ) but the cross section is higher for electron neutrinos , where it can also proceed via the charged current .",
    "sno has been able to measure the three reactions and from them infer a flux of neutrinos from the sun .",
    "the solar flux inferred from these reactions separately , from the data of the second phase and for an effective electron kinetic energy threshold of 5 mev in the cc and es reactions , is @xcite : @xmath42 the excess of the nc flux over the other fluxes is a clear indication that neutrinos from the sun change flavor .",
    "furthermore the total flux from nc is in very good agreement with the total @xmath34 flux of @xmath43 predicted by the ssm @xcite .",
    "the results are illustrated in figure 2 , which shows the flux of muon plus tau neutrinos versus the flux of electron neutrinos which are deduced from the sno measurements @xcite , @xcite .",
    "as it can be seen the cc reaction gives only the electron - neutrino flux , while the other two reactions , ( nc ) and ( es ) , give two different linear combinations of @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the data on es from super - kamiokande is also included in the figure .",
    "the bands intersect at one point , giving a consistent solution .",
    "the band bounded by the dotted lines is the prediction of the ssm .",
    "a long standing problem in physics , the deficit of solar neutrinos with respect to the ssm , is now finally solved .",
    "ratio of the observed @xmath46 spectrum to the expectation for non - oscillation versus @xmath47 obtained by the kamland collaboration . in the analysis @xmath48",
    "is fixed to 180 km .",
    "the solid curve is the expectation for oscillations while the other two lines are the expectation for other models of neutrino disappearance .",
    "the plot is from @xcite . ]",
    "ratio of the observed @xmath46 spectrum to the expectation for non - oscillation versus @xmath47 obtained by the kamland collaboration . in the analysis @xmath48",
    "is fixed to 180 km .",
    "the solid curve is the expectation for oscillations while the other two lines are the expectation for other models of neutrino disappearance .",
    "the plot is from @xcite . ]",
    "another recent experiment , kamland @xcite has confirmed the solar neutrino oscillations .",
    "this experiment detects reactor antineutrinos produced in nuclear reactors in japan , in one kiloton of liquid scintillator .",
    "the typical distances from source to detector ( average 180 km ) and energies of the antineutrinos ( about 3 mev average ) make the experiment sensitive to the solar oscillation parameters , in this case in vacuum ( matter effects can be neglected over these distances ) .",
    "the experiment detected @xmath49 antineutrino interactions while @xmath50 were expected , with a background of @xmath51 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the difference is inconsistent with a square distance decrease of the flux and it is attributed to oscillations .",
    "furthermore the @xmath52 distribution of these antineutrinos , shown in figure 3 , also shows the characteristic distortion expected from oscillations .",
    "the kamland results improve significantly the measurement of the value of @xmath53 with respect to the solar experiments alone ( see below ) .",
    "the results of solar neutrinos are in agreement with the solar model but they also indicate that the neutrinos born as @xmath0 neutrinos in the sun change their nature on their way to the detector on earth .",
    "a full analysis of the problem requires the study of neutrino propagation in a dense medium and its interplay with oscillations .",
    "when the neutrinos propagate in a dense medium , such as the sun core or the earth interior , they can coherently forward - scatter ( refer to the lectures of a. smirnov and j. steinberger in this workshop ) with electrons , neutrons and protons in the medium .",
    "all neutrino types can forward interact through the neutral current but electron neutrinos can also forward - interact with electrons in the medium via a charged current .",
    "coherent forward scattering gives rise to an extra phase that affects neutrino propagation in matter .",
    "this phase is the same for the three neutrino species except for that extra piece in the electron neutrinos due to the charged current interaction with the electrons in the medium .",
    "this extra phase , which has nothing to do with mixing and mass differences , has to be added to that due to mixing , and this can have dramatic consequences in the oscillation .",
    "the extra phase is proportional to the electron density in the medium , to the fermi constant @xmath54 and to the energy of the neutrino .",
    "the oscillation formulae are similar to those in vacuum , with the replacement of the mass differences and mixing angles by effective quantities which depend on the medium @xcite .",
    "the net effect is that the oscillation probabilities can be greatly enhanced with respect to those in vacuum , an effect known as the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) effect @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that in the case of solar neutrinos the matter effect is important for solar densities and for neutrino energies above a few mev , certainly for those coming from the @xmath34 reaction .",
    "the neutrinos born as @xmath0 in the sun propagate to its surface , where they arrive as the pure mass state denoted by @xmath5 , because of matter - enhanced transition .",
    "from there they propagate to the earth ( without oscillating , since they are in a pure mass state ) until they interact .",
    "the probability of producing an electron neutrino , that is , the electron neutrino survival probability , is a direct measure of the electron neutrino component of @xmath5 .",
    "this is essentially the ratio of cc / nc measured by sno .",
    "one of the goals of the sno in the future is to improve this measurement @xcite .    the above interpretation of the data in terms of oscillations with three neutrino mass states , and indeed most of the analysis extracting oscillation parameters from neutrino experiments , makes use of another two results .",
    "one is the result of the chooz @xcite reactor experiment , in which no disappearance of electron antineutrinos ( produced in a nuclear reactor ) was seen over a short baseline of 1 km .",
    "this result , together with the mass difference for atmospheric neutrinos , implies that the @xmath6 neutrino has a negligible component of electron neutrinos ( see below ) .",
    "the other assumption is that the lnsd @xcite result is not valid , otherwise the results from oscillations can not be accommodated in a scheme with just 3 mass states .",
    "the flavor content of the mass states and a summary of what the different experiments contribute to the knowledge of the oscillation parameters is shown in fig .",
    "4 , taken from the article of b. kayser @xcite . as it can be seen a lot is known already about lepton mixing and mass differences , however we do not know the mass hierarchy , that is , we do not know if the mass of the state @xmath6 is larger or smaller than the masses of the states @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "this is because @xmath55 is determined from atmospheric oscillations which are not sensitive to the square of the mass differences ( the oscillation probability depends on the @xmath56 of this quantity ) . for @xmath4 and @xmath5 however we know the sign of the mass difference , since the result is based on the solar oscillations , @xmath57 for which matter effects , which depend on the sign of this quantity , are important .    the neutrino mass - square spectrum from present neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "the figure has been taken from @xcite . ]    when extracting oscillation parameters the mixing matrix is conveniently parameterized in the following way : @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "the two phases @xmath61 and @xmath62 are only present if the neutrino is a majorana particle @xcite and they do not affect oscillations or the interpretation of present neutrino results .",
    "the first matrix governs essentially the oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos while the third governs the oscillation of solar neutrinos .",
    "the angle @xmath63 is essentially the angle extracted from treating atmospheric oscillations as a two - neutrino oscillations , and the angle @xmath64 is essentially the angle extracted from solar experiments treating the solar oscillations as two - neutrino oscillations .",
    "the extraction of oscillation parameters from global fits to all the available data has been studied by several authors , both in the context of three neutrino mass states or , including the lsnd results , four mass states .",
    "here we only show data for three mass states .",
    "the results have been taken from a recent review @xcite .",
    "figure 5 shows the allowed area in the @xmath65 versus @xmath66 plane , including the solar and kamland results .",
    "the plot is taken from the review of s. goswami @xcite .",
    "figure 6 is a similar plot of @xmath33 versus @xmath67 , obtained from atmospheric and k2k ( see below ) results @xcite , @xcite .    in the few years since the first atmospheric results",
    ", the progress in the measurement of the leptonic mixing matrix has been enormous .",
    "what we do not yet is the value @xmath68 ( the electron component of @xmath6 ) , for which only the upper limit @xmath69 ( or @xmath70 ) is known , mainly because of the negative result of the chooz experiment @xcite .",
    "the other completely unknown parameter is the phase @xmath71 . a non - zero @xmath71 value will in general lead to cp violation",
    ", that is , to a difference in the oscillation probability of @xmath72 with respect to @xmath73 .",
    "it is clear that , because of the way @xmath68 and @xmath71 enter in the mixing matrix , the ability to measure @xmath71 in an experiment depends on the value of @xmath68 .",
    "and we do not know yet the mass hierarchy , that is , whether @xmath74 is larger or smaller than @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "one of the main goals of the future accelerator experiments is to measure these quantities .",

    "the allowed region of the @xmath33 versus @xmath67 plane from atmospheric and k2k neutrino experiments @xcite , @xcite . ]",
    "as we have seen neutrino oscillations in atmospheric and solar neutrinos involve large distances , except for the positive result of the lnsd experiment , where evidence was found for muon antineutrino oscillation into electron antineutrinos @xcite .",
    "the baseline for this experiment was only @xmath77 and the energy of the antineutrinos was below 55 mev , since most of them come from positive muons decaying at rest .",
    "the lnsd results are now being checked by an experiment designed for that purpose : the miniboone experiment ( boone stands for booster neutrino experiment ) now taking data at fnal @xcite .",
    "this experiment has a longer baseline than lnsd ( about @xmath78 km ) and also a larger neutrino energy ( average of 0.8 gev ) .",
    "the experiment can run with neutrinos or antineutrinos , by changing the polarity of the focusing horn .",
    "the results of this experiment are eagerly expected .",
    "the first long baseline experiment to have come into operation was k2k , which took data from june of 1999 to november of 2004 @xcite .",
    "the primary goal of this experiment was to study the oscillation parameters that govern atmospheric neutrino oscillations , by looking at the disappearance of muon neutrinos over a baseline of 250 kilometers .",
    "another experiment with the same primary goal is minos , presently taking data . in the near future ,",
    "the cngs ( cern to gran sasso ) project will also start , in this case with the goal to verify explicitly that the atmospheric oscillation is indeed the conversion of @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "these experiments are described in this section .",
    "the beam for k2k ( kek to kamioka ) was produced by focusing positive pions produced in collisions of 12 gev protons from the kek - ps accelerator .",
    "the focusing is achieved by a system of two magnetic horns , located next to the proton target . following the horns",
    "the pions enter a 200 m long decay pipe where they are allowed to decay into muons and neutrinos .",
    "the pipe is tilted downwards by @xmath79 , in such a way that the beam of neutrinos , produced in in - flight @xmath80 decays , points to the super - kamiokande detector , located at a distance of 250 km ( figure 7 ) .",

    "the neutrino beam produced by the kek - ps accelerator is directed towards the super - kamiokande detector , located at a distance of 250 km . ]",
    "that the beam points in the correct direction is ensured by a muon monitor , located after an iron shielding at the end of the decay pipe .",
    "the muon monitor measures the profile of the muons that reach that detector , which have an energy above 5.5 gev .",
    "since the muons and the neutrinos come from the same parent pions they follow the same direction , which is monitored all the time and known with a precision of better than @xmath81 .",
    "a @xmath82 change on the direction induces a 1% change in the flux and neutrino energy spectrum in sk , which are therefore stable at much better than 1% .",
    "the beam stability is also checked directly by studying the spectrum and direction of muons produced in neutrino interactions in the near detector , namely in the muon range detector ( mrd ) described below .",
    "+ the oscillation in k2k is measured by comparing the expected number and energy distribution of muon neutrinos reaching sk with the corresponding quantities that are actually measured .",

    "+ the nd set comprises a 1 kt water cherenkov ( 1kt)which is a scaled down version of the sk detector , and a fine - grained detector system ( fgd ) . the 1 kt cylindrical water tank is optically separated into an inner detector , viewed by 680 photomultiplier tubes ( pmt ) of 50 cm diameter giving a photocathode coverage of 40% , and an outer detector , viewed by 68 pmt of 20 cm diameter , facing outward .",
    "the fgd consists of a scintillating - fiber / water tracker ( scifi ) , a lead - glass calorimeter ( lg ) used in the first part of the running period ( k2k - i ) , replaced by a totally active fine - segmented scintillator tracker ( scibar ) during the second part of the running ( k2k - ii ) , and a muon - range detector ( mrd ) .",
    "the super - kamiokande detector is the far detector and it consists of a 50 kt cylindrical water tank , with a diameter of 39 m and a height of 41m@xcite .",
    "the tank is divided into two optically separated regions .",
    "the inner region has a diameter of 33.8 m and a height of 36.2 m , it contains 32 kts of water and it is viewed by 11,146 pmt of 50 cm diameter , corresponding to a 40% photocathode coverage during phase i , and by 5,182 pmt during phase ii ( after an accident in november of 2002 when approximately half of the pmts were broken ) .",

    "the total flux is inferred from the event rate in the 1kt detector , while the spectrum is computed independently from the information in the 1kt , scifi , lg and scibar detectors and from their information combined .",
    "then an extrapolation of these quantities to the far detector is made , assuming no oscillation .",
    "this extrapolation is calculated by monte carlo , supplemented with several measured ingredients . because of the finite size of the detectors and of the diameter of the decay pipe the far to near ratio of the flux ( f / n ) does not follow an inverse distance - squared law , but it is a function of the energy .",
    "the calculation gives , for each neutrino energy , the ratio @xmath84    the calculation can be carried out precisely if one knows the spectrum and angle of the pions produced in the primary proton interactions with the target . for this experiment",
    "the pion production was taken from a parameterization of pion cross - sections and from the direct measurement of pion production in the harp @xcite experiment , for protons of the same energy than that of the kek - ps , colliding with a target identical to that of k2k .",
    "this information was also checked directly by measuring the pions downstream of the horns by means of a detector , named pimon , which was occasionally put into the beam .",
    "once the far to near ratio is know one can compute the expected number of events in sk and their spectrum assuming no oscillation , and compare them with what is actually measured .",
