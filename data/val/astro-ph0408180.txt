    "the investigation of the dynamics of solar activity and regularity of its cyclicing is of great importance for the astrophysics .",
    "correspondingly the study of those intervals when solar activity is sharply changed is of particular significance .",
    "examples of such interesting periods are : 1100 - 1250 yy `` maximum of middle ages '' , in 1282 - 1342 yy `` volf minimum '' , 1416 - 1534 yy `` shperer minimum '' , 1645 - 1715 yy `` maunder minimum '' .",
    "the period of the maunder minimum has attracted an additional attention because it puts forward a lot of new and unexpected problems . indeed , for a long time scientists consider spots on the sun surface as main characteristics of the solar activity .",
    "therefore , the notes about the disappearance of the sunspot is reliable , but due to the absence of regular observations it is difficult to determine level of solar activity in the mentioned period .    it should be noted that the anomalies are found in differential rotation of the sun surface at the beginning of the maunder minimum .",
    "according of the different authors , it might indicate that global characteristics of the inner parts of the sun change to such at extant that even the `` dynamo '' mechanisms is stopped . in this connection",
    "the following questions arise : how to characterize the sun activity and the radioactive state in the earth s space in that epoch ? what is main processes which cause such a drastic fall of solar activity ? to what extent our insight into the solar activity correct in general ?    for solving mentioned problems",
    "physicist direct their special attention to cosmogenic isotopes @xmath4 @xmath5 , @xmath6 @xmath7 .",
    "the study of these isotopes may give a lot of information about the dynamics of solar activity .    at present",
    "the most complete data about the solar activity and the intensity of cosmic rays are obtained by means of the above mentioned cosmogenic isotopes ( @xmath8 and @xmath6 ) formed in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the main peculiarity of these isotopes and advantage as compared with others is the fact that there exist objects in nature ( e. g. tree rings , arctic and antarctic ices , algae with long life time , etc . ) which can `` fix '' i.e. `` memorize '' annual concentration of the mentioned isotopes , during period that prevails it s half - life time .",
    "to study the influence of solar activity ( modu1ation ) in the earth atmosphere on radiocarbon concentration during the maunder minimum we use experimental data obtained at the laboratory of nuclear physics of the tsu @xcite ( fig .",
    "first of all , it should be noted that experimental data cover the maunder minimum itself ( 1645 - 1720 yy ) ( fig .",
    "2 ) and its neighboring periods ( 1600 - 1645 and 1715 - 1800 yy ) too .",
    "the measurements in @xcite were performed with one - year step , i.e. for every calendar year @xmath4 concentration is measured in the corresponding tree ring .",
    "the experimental samples of tree rings were obtained in lithuania .",
    "the value of @xmath4 concentration in relation to the international standard scale is calculated by the following formula @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11,@xmath12 represents measured activities of the sample ( s ) , standard ( st ) and background ( b ) , respectively . experimental error",
    "does not exceed 0.2 - 0.3% . in order to extract variations of @xmath4",
    "concentration originated only from the `` cosmic '' sources , it is necessary to exclude the influence of the earth s magnetic field .",
    "this influence has been widely discussed and to date the most accurate estimation is that : global change of geomagnetic field with period of 10 thousand years causes about 10% change in @xmath4 data .",
    "the following expression accounts for the geomagnetic field effect in @xmath4 concentration @xmath13 , \\ ] ] where t is current calendar year ( t is negative b.c . ) .",
    "as we mentioned above the effective tool for studying the solar activity dynamics during the maunder minimum is to reveal the cyclings in @xmath4 time dependence ( i.e. periodicities in experimental data given in fig.2 ) . for this purpose",
    "the method of spectral analysis has been used @xcite . the calculated power spectrum is shown in fig.3 . according to fig.3 the main peak at frequency 0.05 lies in high reliability interval ( 95% ) ( corresponding period @xmath2 year ) .",
    "small peak is observed at frequency 0.12 ( corresponding period @xmath3 year ) though it s reliability is comparatively low .",
    "1 .   using the method of spectral analysis",
    "we have revealed variations in cosmogenic radiocarbon concentration in the earth atmosphere during the maunder minimum .",
    "periodicities of two types have been revealed in experimental data .",
    "3 .   the reason of the mentioned periodicities is the solar activity .",
    "this means that in the maunder minimum period modulating action of the sun was weak , nevertheless cycling is preserved",
    ". it can be also said that in period of the maunder minimum the mechanism of solar dynamo still works .",
    "reduction of the number of the sunspots may be caused by the coincidence of the minima of any other long - term periodicities at the moment of the maunder minimum .",
