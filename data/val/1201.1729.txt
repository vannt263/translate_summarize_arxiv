    "low - density optically thin , hot plasmas with ion temperature exceeding 1 mev can form near compact relativistic objects , such as in accretion flows close to black holes@xcite and in strong shock waves related , for example , to supernova explosions.@xcite the most straightforward approach to studying the dynamics of formation and evolution of such plasmas is the detection of prompt @xmath1-ray lines which are unambiguous signatures of specific nuclei .",
    "collisions in thermal plasmas with temperatures exceeding 1  mev are characterized not only by excitation reactions with emission of gamma - ray lines , but also by the destruction of nuclei . generally , in such plasmas , the destruction of nuclei proceeds on timescales shorter than excitations ones .",
    "thus , only prompt de - excitation lines related to specific nuclei are expected to contribute to the plasma radiation.@xcite the presence of a given prompt @xmath1-ray line is related to the existence of a given nucleus , which is itself governed by the destruction processes .",
    "this suggests that there should exist a strong relation between the gamma - ray line spectrum and nuclear destruction processes .",
    "the break - up processes are sensitive to the plasma temperature and density .",
    "therefore , the detection of @xmath1-ray lines and their spectral profile evolution may reveal unique information about the chemical composition and physical parameters of the plasma , such as temperature and density at any given time .",
    "the first attempts to assess the importance of nuclear processes in hot , thin astrophysical plasmas were made in refs .  ,",
    ". different astrophysical implications of nuclear reactions in hot two - temperature plasmas have been discussed also in ref .   - .",
    "these works provide estimates for the isotope ratios of different light elements such as deuterium ( d ) , @xmath5li , @xmath6li @xmath7be , @xmath9b , etc , and also estimates for the @xmath1-ray line luminosity due to nuclear reactions .",
    "a mechanism to produce light elements , alternative to big - bang nucleosynthesis , is also suggested in refs .  ,  .",
    "in particular , they discuss a mechanism for deuterium production in hot plasmas .",
    "in these early works , however , only a limited number of reactions could be taken into account , mainly due to the lack of data on nuclear cross sections and the increased computational complexity of calculations as more nuclei are considered .",
    "most of these difficulties have nowadays been overcome .",
    "the introduction of on - line nuclear databases@xcite@xmath10@xcite provides easy access to experimental and theoretical data on nuclear cross sections .",
    "there also exist publicly available computer codes that allow the calculation of nuclear cross sections and other quantities of interest .",
    "these make use of several theoretical models .    in this work",
    "we build a large nuclear reaction network and use it to calculate the temporal evolution of the composition , the @xmath1-ray line emissivity , and the corresponding @xmath1-ray spectrum , for a low density plasma with ion temperature @xmath11  mev .",
    "two cases are considered : when the temperature and density evolve with time , and when they remain constant .",
    "we present results for the abundance of light elements and the baryonic @xmath1-ray spectrum due to nuclear reactions and neutron - proton bremsstrahlung . finally , we discuss some mechanisms that could enhance the production of light elements",
    ". this could be of special importance , because it could modify the cosmic abundance of light elements predicted by the standard big - bang nucleosynthesis model .",
    "the production of neutrons is also of considerable interest , since these particles can escape from the source and interact with nearby targets .",
    "the calculation of the evolution of the nuclear abundances and the @xmath1-ray line emission in low density , high temperature plasmas , requires the use of a comprehensive nuclear network .",
    "this network should take into account all relevant nuclear reactions that may occur in a hot plasma with @xmath11  mev .",
    "there is an extensive literature about how to build and solve nuclear networks , e.g. see refs .   - .",
    "nowadays , all this knowledge is compressed and very easy to access through on - line nuclear databases for astrophysical applications , such as _ jina reaclib_,@xcite _ non - smoker_,@xcite _ nucastrodata_,@xcite etc .",
    "there also exist many computer programs which store , manage and solve the networks , e.g. _ libnuceq _ and _ libnucnet_.@xcite however , all these nuclear networks are designed to be applied in scenarios such as big - bang nucleosynthesis , core collapse supernova , stellar interiors , etc .",
    "generally , they are valid for temperatures @xmath12  k. therefore , to describe nuclear reactions for astrophysical plasmas with @xmath13  k ( or @xmath14  mev ) , we find it necessary to extend the aforementioned works . without loosing generality , our main purpose is to describe the evolution of the abundance of nuclear species and the @xmath1-ray emission of a very hot , low density and optically thin astrophysical plasma . to further simplify the problem",
    ", we assume the following conditions hold :    * all nuclei are instantaneously thermalized , and their velocity distributions are described by a maxwellian distribution function at temperature @xmath15 , * all target nuclei interact in their ground state , * the plasma has low density ( @xmath16 ) and high temperature ( @xmath14  mev ) , and its initial composition is similar to the standard cosmic / solar chemical abundances .",
    "these assumptions dramatically simplify the reaction network .",
    "the first assumption reduces the calculation of the reaction rates to a simply maxwellian average @xmath17 .",
    "thus , @xmath17 will be only a function of the temperature @xmath15 as shown in ref .",
    ": @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the projectile cm - frame energy , @xmath20 is the cross section of the binary interaction @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the reduced mass of the interacting system , and @xmath23 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the second assumption simplifies both the calculation of the cross sections and the reaction rates . in a high temperature plasma , different isomeric states of a given nucleus",
    "may be in thermal equilibrium .",
    "therefore , to obtain the reaction rate , one should sum the contributions of all isomers.@xcite@xmath10@xcite@xmath24@xcite as a first approach , we have assumed here that all isomeric states decay before the nuclei interact .    the third assumption restricts the number of targets / channels and interactions to be taken into account .    under these assumptions , and since we are interested in low density plasmas , only the binary interactions contribute to the chain of nuclear reactions . for the composition of plasmas similar to standard astrophysical environments , only the reactions with participation of protons ( @xmath25 ) , neutrons ( @xmath26 ) , and alpha particles ( @xmath27 ) are important , c.f .",
    "[ app : assum ] .",
    "although the nuclear reaction rates for @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 projectiles can be simply calculated from the local conditions of the plasma - such as ion temperature and density - this is not the case for the interactions of photons with nuclei .",
    "the @xmath1-interaction reaction rates not only depend on local parameters , but also on the number density of photons , which itself depends on the optical depth of the plasma .",
    "furthermore , the optical depth is also a function of `` non - local '' variables such as the electron number density and size of the plasma .",
    "the @xmath1-rays are produced and transported inside the plasma .",
    "hot two - temperature plasmas radiate x - rays and @xmath1-rays through interactions of both components of the plasma .",
    "the dominant radiative cooling channels for ions are the excitation of nuclei with production of prompt @xmath1-ray lines , the @xmath1-radiation released at @xmath28 capture , as well as @xmath28 bremsstrahlung .",
    "the electronic component radiates more efficiently , predominantly through bremsstrahlung , and in the case of large optical depth , is cooled due to comptonization .    because the photon number density depends on the optical depth of the plasma , the effect of the photodisintegration of nuclei",
    "can not be estimated without considering the plasma as a whole .",
    "the importance of this effect must be checked for each specific problem . in this paper",
    "we have neglected photodisintegration . generally , this is a good approximation for optically thin , low density plasmas .",
    "we illustrate in [ app : gamma ] the effect of the photodisintegration on @xmath29o and deuterium nuclei , for the case of a spherically symmetric and optically thin plasma .",
    "we show that even if the electron temperature is comparable with the ion temperature , the effect of photodisintegration on the evolution of the plasma can still be safely neglected",
    ". however , this might not be the case for an optically thick plasma , or for the case where nuclear statistical equilibrium is reached .",
    "the integral in eq.([rf ] ) is evaluated over the energy range ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) . in practice",
    ", however , one needs to integrate eq.([rf ] ) only in a `` narrow '' energy interval from which comes the most important contribution to the reaction rate . to have an accurate estimation of the reaction rate we must know precisely the cross sections in that narrow energy range , since the contribution of the leftover interval is negligible , by definition . as discussed in [ app : ener ] , in the temperature range 0.1 - 20  mev the most relevant interval of projectile energy is that between 0.01 mev and 150 mev .",
    "the maxwellian average @xmath17 is the main ingredient to solve the kinetic equations.@xcite it is convenient though , to work with mass fraction abundances instead of number densities .",
    "if we define the mass fraction abundance of the element @xmath32 as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the mass number , and @xmath35 the nucleon density , can be converted to mass density @xmath36 , simply by multiplying it with nucleon mass @xmath37 , @xmath38 then for our case the kinetic equation reads : @xmath39 the index @xmath32 runs over the three types of projectiles ( protons , neutrons and alpha particles ) , whereas @xmath40 runs over all @xmath41 elements of the network .",
    "the remaining step for calculating @xmath42 in eq.([rf ] ) , is to provide the cross sections in the relevant projectile energy interval .",
    "we chose to use the public available code talys@xcite to calculate the cross sections @xmath20 for all relevant nuclear interactions , together with the @xmath1-ray lines associated with these interactions .",
    "talys is an attractive tool to be applied to the study of nuclear processes in high - temperature plasmas because :    i. : :    the energy of the projectile can be in the range 1 kev-200 mev , ii .",
    ": :    it incorporates modern nuclear models for the optical model , level    densities , direct reactions , compound reactions , pre - equilibrium    reactions , iii . : :    it can treat @xmath1 , @xmath26 , @xmath25 ,    d , t , @xmath3he , and @xmath27-particles as both    projectiles and ejectiles , vi . :",
    ":    target mass numbers can be between @xmath43 and    @xmath44 .",
    "the code can also calculate cross section for    targets with mass number in the range @xmath45 , but the    results may not be as accurate .",
    "we used talys to calculate the cross sections for reactions involving elements from @xmath46li to @xmath47zn . for targets with ( i.e. @xmath26 , @xmath25 , d , t , @xmath3he , @xmath4he ) , we collected the cross sections from theoretical evaluations ; when no evaluations were available we used experimental data .",
    "both evaluations and experimental data points were taken from the publicly available databases endf@xcite and exfor.@xcite    the reaction network should in principle satisfy a `` closure condition '' : the reaction products of all nuclei in the network must be also part of the same network .",
    "in practice we select the most relevant reactions / channels , which implies that the closure condition holds only approximately .",
    "we can fix the accuracy up to which the closure condition is satisfied by introducing a threshold value for the maxwellian average .",
    "every channel with a maxwellian average smaller than the threshold is ignored .",
    "changing the value of the threshold changes the number of reaction channels in consideration , therefore this parameter plays a crucial role in the accuracy of the solution , the calculation time , the dimension of the network , etc .    to calculate the cross sections and reaction rates for nuclei from @xmath46li to @xmath47zn we proceeded as follows . using talys we calculated the cross sections for the interaction of solar abundance nuclei ( the stable nuclei ) from @xmath46li to @xmath47zn , with @xmath26 , @xmath25 and @xmath27 as projectiles .",
    "then , the corresponding reaction rates were calculated as in eq.([rf ] ) . at @xmath48",
    "mev the largest reaction rates are of the order of @xmath49 .",
    "we chose a threshold value @xmath50 , ensuring that the contribution of the dismissed reactions would be no more than @xmath51 .    from the selected channels new targets",
    "may appear .",
    "they are potentially created in the plasma due to the reactions of the previous generation of nuclei , and enter in the calculations as a second target generation .",
    "we then repeated the previous procedure for the new targets , i.e. calculating the cross sections , the reaction rates , and the selection of the relevant channels according to the chosen threshold value .",
    "the new channels may still introduce a third generation of new nuclei .",
    "we applied the algorithm until there is no generation of new nuclear species .",
    "the network is then closed up to the accuracy given by @xmath52 . notice that the value of @xmath52 must be adjusted according to the scope of the problem , and there is no general advice for its choice .",
    "we extended our calculations by fitting the maxwellian averages @xmath42 as a function of temperature using the parameterization with seven parameters suggested in ref .  ,",
    "@xmath53    the fit is valid for @xmath54 $ ] mev .",
    "we estimated the goodness of the fit for the seven parameters using the @xmath55 method . in the mentioned temperature range",
    "the majority of the rates have a residual fluctuation less than 5% .",
    "as we have already mentioned , for light elements with @xmath56 we obtained the relevant cross sections from evaluations or , in the case where no evaluations were found , from experimental data points .",
    "it must be mentioned here that using evaluations or experimental data introduces additional uncertainties .",
    "some evaluations do not exceed projectile energies of 20 mev . in these cases , we extrapolated the cross section in the high energy region as @xmath57 , see e.g. ref .  .",

    "in particular , neutron decay plays a major role in our problem due to its high abundance and relatively short lifetime , @xmath61 s.@xcite we have taken into account neutron decay in our calculations .",
    "after calculating all the @xmath42 , we are ready to solve the system of differential equations eq.([eq : abund ] ) for each species in the network .",
    "our network contains a relatively large number of nuclear species ( around 270 ) .",
    "therefore the system of differential equations is too complicated to be solved analytically , and must be solved numerically .",
    "we used the matlab^^ s _ `` ode15s '' _ solver , which is an implementation of the klopfenstein - shampine family of numerical differentiation formulas ( ndf ) of orders 1 to 5.@xcite    the numerical solver does not guarantee a physically meaningful solution , we then included some constraints to be checked in every solution step .",
    "the constraints originate from conserved quantities such as the number of nucleons ( or baryon number conservation ) , electric charge , etc .",
    "one of the most important constraints is baryon number conservation , which can be written as    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the number density of nucleons .",
    "this condition ensures that the number of nucleons remains constant even if , for instance , neutrons decay .",
    "we present the solution of the nuclear network for some simple cases . as a first example , we considered a unit volume of plasma at two fixed - temperatures , 1 mev and 10 mev .",

    "we then evolved the plasma for a period of 100 s. the temporal evolution of the plasma composition and the @xmath1-ray line emission is shown in figs .",

    "as discussed above , we validated our network by calculating the mass abundance evolution of all the nuclei for some special cases .",
    "figures [ fig : c ] to [ fig : fe ] show the temporal evolution of the mass fraction abundances and the number of photons of a given energy emitted per unit time and volume for the cases considered .",

    "it is clear that the value of the temperature has a strong impact on the characteristic timescales of the reactions .",
    "this is because the rates of almost all reactions increase with temperature , and correspondingly the nuclear abundances and the emission of @xmath1-rays evolves much faster .",
    "note from figures [ fig : c ] to [ fig : fe ] that some intermediate elements ( the result of break - up processes ) , become more abundant in certain periods of the evolution . at higher temperatures",
    "more interaction channels are opened , which leads to more @xmath1-ray lines due to the de - excitation of nuclei . in the case",
    "when the plasma cooling timescale is such that all reactions freeze at a time when intermediate elements are relativity more abundant , this can result in higher - than - normal abundances of such elements at the end of the network s evolution , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : time ] .",
    "the tendency of @xmath74  mev plasmas is to destroy , very quickly , all nuclei heavier than @xmath4he , and to a first approximation , we may conclude that on time scales @xmath75  s a proton - neutron plasma is formed .",
    "we also observe for times @xmath76  s that some small traces of deuterium , tritium , @xmath3he and @xmath4he are present .",
    "this is a result of the break - up processes and weak fusion reactions which take place on longer timescales .",
    "a result of the proton - neutron plasma formation is that all @xmath1-ray line emission disappears . for timescales",
    "@xmath77  s , neutron capture by protons through the reaction @xmath78 , can produce deuterium and the emission of 2.22  mev @xmath1-ray photons . due to the kinematics",
    "the 2.22  mev emission line should be broadened and shifted  by approximately @xmath79  as is shown in figs .",

    "the abundance of light elements such as li , be and b is practically negligible for a constant temperature and density plasma .",
    "hydrogen and helium isotopes , however , are much more abundant due to proton and neutron equilibrium , provided that the system remains in equilibrium .",
    "high temperature , low density plasmas have a characteristic @xmath1-ray spectrum of baryonic origin . as we showed in section [ subsec:2 ]",
    "the spectrum has two main components , a continuum and a discrete component . because of the doppler - broadening the lines overlap , the result being a `` continuum '' with some little bumps in the position of the strongest lines .",
    "the line spectrum dominates only on timescales shorter than nuclear destructions one ; over longer timescales the dominant part of the spectrum comes from the proton - neutron plasma radiation , which is mainly @xmath25-@xmath26 bremsstrahlung and @xmath81 capture .",
    "the destiny of a long - lived ( i.e. , @xmath82 ) , constant density and temperature plasma , is a purely protonic composition ( cf .",

    "this is due to the @xmath83-decay of free neutrons into protons , and as a result no other element will remain in equilibrium . ref .",
    "suggested a `` neutron evaporation '' mechanism through which a fraction of the neutrons escape the plasma , so that high - temperature , low - density plasmas may be astrophysical neutron sources . the neutrons might be captured by surrounding ( relatively ) cold(er ) material such as hydrogen and form deuterium , emitting 2.22  mev @xmath1-rays .",
    "the observation of this spectral line would serve to reveal the existence of the nearby neutron source .",
    "plasmas which for some reason are cooled to such an extent that reactions are frozen at the right moment in time , could produce a higher abundance of intermediate elements ( and therefore light elements ) as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : time ] .",
    "we conclude by suggesting that such a scenario could be physically plausible in situations where the plasma expands and cools , for example when being crossed by shock waves formed during a supernova explosion .",
    "since supernova explosions are ubiquitous in the universe , this mechanism could , in principle , change cosmic abundances .",
    "we thank arjan koning and stephane goriely for their helpful advice regarding talys .",
    "we also want to thank david jones and maxim barkov for their very helpful suggestions .",
    "here we intend to justify numerically the assumptions described in section [ sec : cross ] .",
    "first of all , we have restricted ourself to a domain of low densities and high temperatures , i.e. @xmath84 and @xmath14 mev . as we have already mentioned in section [ sec : intro ] , under such conditions break - up processes are dominant . therefore , all heavy nuclei will be destroyed `` instantly '' , resulting in a proton - neutron plasma with some traces of light nuclei such as d , t , @xmath3he , @xmath4he .",
    "secondly , the astrophysical environments where these type of plasmas are supposed to exist are such that we are allowed to start our calculations with an initial plasma composition similar to solar or cosmic composition of elements.@xcite    the fact that all heavier nuclei are `` instantaneously '' destroyed , and that the initial composition is solar / cosmic ( i.e. abundances of nuclei heavier than @xmath4he are at least three orders of magnitude below ) , suggest that heavier nuclei than @xmath4he will never become abundant .",
    "below we attempt to quantify the importance of heavy nuclei interactions .",
    "first of all , we want to illustrate the claim that break - up processes are the most important processes for @xmath85  mev plasmas . in [ app : plot ] , for some important nuclei , are compared total nonelastic with inelastic cross - sections , and their corresponding reaction - rates . in that work",
    "are also compared the total nonelastic and capture reaction cross sections together with the corresponding rates .",
    "the plots show that the rates of break - up processes ( the difference between total nonelastic and inelastic ) is bigger than excitation ( inelastic ) and capture reactions for @xmath85 mev .",
    "secondly , by starting with a plasma composition similar to solar / cosmic chemical abundance , it is clear that the most abundant elements are hydrogen and helium , followed three to four orders of magnitude below by oxygen , neon , nitrogen , carbon , etc .",
    "therefore , the major contribution will come from proton and alpha interactions due to their higher abundances .    to quantify it ,",
    "let us look at the destruction timescales e.g. for the @xmath29o nucleus , as the third most abundant element .",
    "let us consider reactions of proton , alpha and @xmath29o projectiles with @xmath29o targets .",
    "the destruction reaction rates will be given by :    @xmath86    from ref .",
    "we get the ratios : @xmath87 , @xmath88 .    to estimate the order of magnitude value of the reaction rate for the above reactions we simply considered constant cross sections with value equal to the peak value . from measurements in ref .",
    "- , we get these peak values : @xmath89 b ( total nonelastic ) , @xmath90 b ( total nonelastic ) , and @xmath91 b ( it is of the order of the sum of all reaction cross sections ) .    the reaction rate for constant cross section is @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the mean relative velocity , @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the reduced mass . hence , the destruction reaction rates ratios are :    @xmath96 @xmath97    the last estimate shows that neglecting interactions with projectiles different from protons and alphas will cause an error @xmath98    then , with an accuracy better than @xmath51 we may neglect all nuclear reactions except those that involve protons and/or alphas .",
    "one must note here that due to the break - up processes , the number of neutrons increases very fast and they become very abundant .",
    "therefore neutron interactions become important soon . after taking all these into account ,",
    "we conclude that the most important nuclear interactions in high - temperature , low - density plasmas , are those reactions which involve protons , neutrons and alphas as projectiles .",
    "the interactions of heavy nuclei will never become important .      as discussed in [ app : assum ] , the most important projectiles are protons , neutrons and alpha particles .",
    "plasmas produce photons through ion - nuclear reactions and electron bremsstrahlung ( see section .  [",

    "in high temperature ( @xmath122  mev ) , low density , optically thin ( @xmath123 ) plasma , the electrons are heated due to coulomb exchange with ions and are cooled due to bremsstrahlung , which has a higher rate than heating . in the extreme case of electrons getting heated to high temperatures ( @xmath124  mev ) , pair - production processes become non - negligible , and thus , the plasma will cool down ( see ref .   and ref .  ) .",

    "8 reveals that for a spherically symmetric , optically thin plasma with size @xmath130 , and number density @xmath131 , and for a solar / cosmic initial abundance , the photodisintegration rate is negligible .",
    "even when the electron temperature becomes comparable with the ion temperature , the photodisintegration reaction rate is 3 - 4 orders of magnitude below other nuclear reaction rates , which is clearly seen by comparing @xmath29o@xmath127 and @xmath29o@xmath129 . in the case",
