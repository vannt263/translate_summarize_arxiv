    "the seemingly disjoint topics of strong gravitational lensing and of the host galaxies that surround the luminous qsos at high redshift , enjoy a symbiotic relationship .",
    "_ hosts constrain lensing :  _ gravitationally lensed radio lobes can provide - through their spatially extended nature - more constraints on the lensing potential than the two or four point source images that are found in optically selected or radio - quiet qsos . as the majority of high - z qsos are radio - quiet , the extended stellar light of the host galaxies that surround qsos , can provide a welcome subsitute for extended radio emission ; the host galaxies form  optical einstein rings  or small arcs when lensed .",
    "recent examples include pg  1115 + 080 ( impey 1998 ) , mg  1131 + 0456 ( kochanek 1999 ) , q  0957 + 561 ( keeton 1999 , _ in prep .",
    "_ ) , and b  1938 + 666 ( king 1998 ) .",
    "because gravitational lensing preserves the surface brightness of the source , different images of the same host position in the source plane should only differ in surface brightness through differential dust extinction along the various image paths . in this way",
    ", optical images of the lensed hosts could provide a more sensitive probe of the ism in distant galaxies than the point sources alone ( falco 1999 ) .",
    "_ lensing helps to see host galaxies :  _ gravitational lensing magnifies both the nuclear qso emission and the surrounding host galaxy . for the unresolved nucleus this magnification simply results in a flux increase without observable changes in the source morphology ; in contrast , the extended host emission is `` stretched away '' from the nucleus at a constant surface brightness . if the psf falls off with radius @xmath2 , as for hst , gravitational lensing changes the local contrast in favor of the extended light proportional to the square of the magnification .",
    "0.3truein    in the data of the castles ( see _ http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/castles/_ ) project several factors come together to provide unprecedented sensitivity to detecting qso host galaxies : ( 1 ) hst provides a relatively stable psf with a fwhm of @xmath3 ; ( 2 ) for a qso at @xmath4 , the host galaxy is an order of magnitude more prominent at @xmath5 compared to the agn than at optical wavelengths ; ( 3 ) the low near - ir background from space improves the sensitivity to low - surface brightness features in the outer parts of the host galaxy ; ( 4 ) gravitational lensing further improves the host ",
    "agn contrast as discussed above .    for these reasons",
    ", we initiated a study of the host galaxies around gravitationally lensed quasars .",
    "as the lens magnification is physically unrelated to the source structure , our sample of lensed qsos should not be significantly biased compared to other samples , save some possible luminosity bias . in this paper",
    ", we summarize briefly the state of other host galaxy studies (  2 ) , describe the results from the castles study (  3 ) and compare them to recent theoretical models of central black hole and host galaxy growth at high redshifts (  4 ) .",
    "explicit empirical demonstrations that qsos are indeed active nuclei surrounded by host galaxies have been pursued for 25 years , but have been hampered , especially for distant sources , by contrast problems with the much brighter nucleus , particularly because @xmath6 .",
    "nonetheless , for qsos at @xmath7 , host galaxy detections have now become routine both at visible and near - ir wavelengths ( hutchings and neff 1992 ; mcleod and rieke 1995 ; bahcall 1995 ) , and a fairly coherent picture is emerging : radio - quiet qsos ( rqq ) typically live in early - type disk galaxies ( s0-sb ) whose luminosity range is centered around @xmath8 ; radio - loud qsos live in slightly more luminous hosts ( @xmath9 ) . while tidal interactions may be conducive to qso activity they are not necessary .",
    "mcleod ( 1999 ) showed that in all nearby qsos ( @xmath10 ) there is a maximum nuclear luminosity for any given h - band host luminosity ( figure 1 ) . converting the host luminosity into a stellar mass , @xmath11 , and applying to these qsos the locally inferred relation @xmath12 ( magorrian 1998 ) between @xmath11 and the nuclear black hole ( bh )",
    "mass , mcleod ( 1999 ) deduce that these qsos can shine at most with @xmath13 .    at higher redshifts ( @xmath14 )",
    "the host galaxy picture becomes observationally less clear .",
    "the hosts of radio - loud qsos ( rlq ) have been detected in sizeable samples with reasonable completeness ( @xmath15 ) , mostly through near - ir imaging from the ground ( kotilainen 1998 , carballo 1998 ) .",
    "these have become possible in part because rlqs at these epochs seem to live in extremely luminous galaxies .",
    "the observed rlq hosts do not seem to have comparably bright present - day counter parts , but it is still not entirely clear whether most of their ( rest ) optical emission really is stellar . in most ground - based searches for rqq hosts beyond @xmath16 the detection completeness has been very low : findings are still published on individual objects ( aretxaga 1998 ) .",
    "the relatively few existing detections ( hutchings 1985 ) , and by implication the non - detections , suggest that the rqq hosts are of modest luminosity .",
    "the existing observations leave open a number of important questions about the hosts of distant qsos , which we can address through the lensing studies :    * are all qsos embedded in substantial host galaxies , or are there `` naked '' qsos ? * do the most luminous qsos ( mostly rqqs ) at their heyday ( @xmath4 ) , live in the most luminous galaxies at their epoch ? *",
    "do the hosts of rqqs and rlqs differ increasingly with growing redshift ? * is there the same maximum nuclear luminosity at a given host luminosity in distant qsos than at @xmath10 ? as qsos were more luminous in the past , and most galaxies were in lower mass fragments , one might expect an evolution of such a relation .",
    "to study gravitationally lensed qsos systematically , the castles project has obtained deep f160w ( h - band ) images ( typically for one orbit ) of most known lens systems .",
    "we have begun to derive de - magnified h - band magnitudes for the host galaxies wherever they are detected . in the four image systems we should expect that at least some portion of the host is highly magnified and becomes a detectable arc .",
    "indeed , in most highly magnified cases there is such a qualitative detection , indicating that `` naked quasars '' are rare , if they exist at all .",
    "however , the demagnification of such systems ( pg  1115 + 080 , fig .",
    "2 ) can be quite complex ; certainly , the de - magnification of two - image lenses ( q0957 + 561 , fig .",
    "2 ) is more straightforward .    in figure 3 , we have summarized the magnitudes ( and upper limit ) for an initial set of six objects ( rix 1999 ) . clearly , these host galaxies of rqqs are much fainter than bright radio galaxies ( @xmath17 ) at similar redshifts .",
    "for comparison , figure 3 also shows the apparent brightness of two galaxies with two different star formation histories ( sfh ) that both result in @xmath18 galaxies at the present epoch .",
    "if the hosts had formed all their stars at high redshift ( an @xmath18 s worth ) , they would appear much brighter .",
    "however , if the hosts formed stars continuously similar to the milky way , the predicted magnitudes match the observations .",
    "this is consistent with qso living in unexceptional host galaxies with typical sfhs that lead to @xmath18 now .",
    "it is instructive to compare the relation between nuclear and host luminosity for our sources at @xmath0 to the low redshift results of mcleod 1999 .",
    "the large filled circles in figure 1 represent the initial results from castles and show that at higher redshift the hosts are comparatively much fainter than at later epochs .",
    "this discrepancy would increase considerably if we compared the minimum stellar mass ( rather than h - band luminosity ) at high and low redshift . indeed , after accounting for about one magnitude of h - band m / l evolution , we would be lead to conclude that these luminous qsos at high redshift have super - eddington luminosities , _ if the same @xmath19 @xmath20 relation were to hold .",
    "_    instead , it appears more plausible to infer that the central bhs grew faster at early epochs than the surrounding hosts , so that @xmath21 in this case , a less massive and less luminous host galaxy could sustain a more luminous nucleus .",
    "recently , kauffmann and hhnelt ( 1999 ) have explored the connection between galaxy formation and central bh growth through semi - analytic models , trying to explain evolution of the galaxy population and of the qso luminosity function simultaneously .",
    "their models predict a quite steep evolution in the @xmath22 vs @xmath23 relation ( see figure 4 ) , but one that exactly matches our findings .",
    "support for the castles project was provided by nasa through grant numbers go-7495 and go-7887 from the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc .",
