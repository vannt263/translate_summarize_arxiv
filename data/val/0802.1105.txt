    ", the central nervous system can be described as a complex network of oscillators @xcite , and cultured networks of heart cells are examples of biological structures with strong nearest - neighbor coupling @xcite . in particular , the emergence of synchrony in such networks @xcite has received increased attention in recent years .    disorder and noise in physical systems usually tend to destroy spatial and temporal regularity . however ,",
    "in nonlinear systems , often the opposite effect is found and intrinsically noisy processes , such as thermal fluctuations or mechanically randomized scattering , lead to surprisingly ordered patterns @xcite . for instance , arrays of coupled oscillators can be synchronized by randomizing the phases of their driving forces @xcite .",
    "synchronization in these systems is caused by the interactions between the elements and results in the emergence of collective modes .",
    "it has been shown to be a fundamental mechanism of self - organization and structure formation in systems of coupled oscillators @xcite .",
    "biological systems of neurons are subject to different sources of noise , such as synaptic noise @xcite or channel noise @xcite . in particular ,",
    "sensory neurons are notoriously noisy .",
    "therefore , the question arises how stochastic influences affect the functioning of biological systems .",
    "especially interesting are scenarios in which noise enhances performance . in the case of stochastic resonance @xcite ,",
    "e.g. , noise can improve the ability of a system to transfer information reliably , and the presence of this phenomenon in neural systems has been investigated @xcite . furthermore , numerous studies have addressed the effect of noise on the dynamics of limit cycle systems @xcite .",
    "small neural circuits composed of two or three neurons form the basic feedback mechanisms involved in the regulation of neural activity @xcite .",
    "they can display oscillatory activity @xcite and serve as central pattern generators involved in motor control @xcite . here , we consider a system of two limit cycle oscillators with repulsive coupling .",
    "we investigate the influence of the noise and the coupling strength on the dynamics of the system .",
    "we distinguish between two different classes of dynamics , a synchronized state , in which the joint probability density of the oscillator phases is characterized by a single - hump shape , and a desynchronized state .",
    "the single - hump shaped distribution of the oscillator phases has been modeled by a gaussian distribution @xcite , and systems consisting of a large number of oscillators were analyzed by examining the resulting dynamics for the mean of the oscillator phases @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the simplicity of our two oscillator system allows us to obtain the stationary probability density function for the full system both numerically and analytically .",
    "we show that the probability distribution of the oscillator phases has the single - hump shape only for weak coupling , whereas it deviates from this shape for strong coupling .",
    "we evaluate the coupling strength at which the transition between the two forms of the probability distribution occurs as a function of the noise intensity .    in sect .",
    "[ sect2 ] , we introduce the kuramoto model for excitable systems . under the influence of noise ,",
    "the dynamics of the limit cycle oscillators are described by a stochastic differential equation ( sde ) , and we state the fokker - planck equation for the system . in sect .",
    "[ sect3 ] , we consider a single active rotator driven by noise and derive its mean angular frequency from the stationary solution to the fokker - planck equation .",
    "we compare our analytical results with monte - carlo simulations of the corresponding sde . in sect .",
    "[ sect4 ] , we consider two coupled deterministic rotators and perform a bifurcation analysis of the system . we show that the system possesses a fixed point that is stable for small coupling strengths but looses its stability when the coupling is increased . for some range of the coupling strength , the stable fixed point and a stable limit cycle coexist . in sect .",
    "[ sect5 ] , we consider two coupled active rotators under uncorrelated stochastic influences . in sect .",
    "[ sect5a ] , we solve the fokker - planck equation of the system numerically and show that the shape of the probability distribution undergoes a characteristic change , corresponding to the transition from a synchronized to a desynchronized state , as coupling is increased .",
    "we evaluate the boundary between the synchronous and the asynchronous regime through a fourier expansion approach in sect .",

    "a summary concludes the paper in sect .",
    "[ sect6 ] .",
    "neurons can display a wide range of behavior to different stimuli and numerous models exist to describe neuronal dynamics .",
    "a common feature of both biological and model neurons is that sufficiently strong input causes them to fire periodically ; the neuron displays oscillatory activity . for subthreshold inputs , on the other hand ,",
    "the neuron is quiescent .",
    "when a subthreshold input is combined with a noisy input , however , the neuron will be pushed above threshold from time to time and fire spikes in a stochastic manner . in this regime , the neuron acts as an excitable element . in general ,",
    "an excitable system possesses a stable equilibrium point from which it can temporarily depart by a large excursion through its phase space when it receives a stimulus of sufficient strength @xcite .",
    "besides neurons , chemical reactions , lasers , models of blood clotting , and cardiac tissues all display excitable dynamics @xcite .",
    "pulse propagation , spiral waves , spatial and temporal chaos , and synchronization have been studied in these systems @xcite .",

    "strong noise has a desynchronizing effect on the system , as the minimal coupling for desynchronization vanishes in the limit of @xmath37 . if the noise is weak , however , it stabilizes the synchronized state , as is indicated by the initially upward slope of the phase boundary in fig .",

    "the synchronized state of the system is most stable for intermediate noise .",
    "we have investigated the transition from synchronized to desynchronized behavior in a system of two - coupled active rotators under stochastic influences .",
    "the two regimes are distinguished by the sign of the second derivative of the marginal probability density at vanishing phase difference .",
    "we have evaluated the phase boundary between the two states in the ( coupling strength ) - ( noise intensity ) plane .",
    "finally , we have shown that the synchronized state is most stable , in the sense that the coupling strength required to desynchronize the system is maximal for nonvanishing noise intensity .",
