    "except for a finite list of interesting exceptions , richard roth @xcite has classified isonemal periodic prefabric designs into 39 infinite species falling into three more general classes as well as the previously defined genera @xcite .",
    "species 110 have reflection or glide - reflection symmetries with parallel axes and no rotational symmetry , not even half - turns .",
    "species 1132 have reflection or glide - reflection symmetries with perpendicular axes , hence half - turns , but no quarter - turns .",
    "species 3339 have quarter - turn symmetries but no mirror or glide - reflection symmetries .",
    "this taxonomy has been refined slightly and used in @xcite , to which reference needs to be made , to determine the feasible symmetry groups and hence isonemal prefabrics . as roth observes beginning his subsequent paper @xcite on perfect colourings , ` [ r]ecent mathematical work on the theory of woven fabrics ' begins with @xcite , which remains the fundamental reference . in that paper roth determines which fabrics  actually prefabrics  can be perfectly coloured by striping warp and weft .",
    "this paper is intended to reconsider that topic in terms of roth s taxonomy as refined in @xcite and also to consider further the related question which of isonemal prefabrics fall apart .",
    "a _ prefabric , _ as defined by grnbaum and shephard @xcite , consists of two or more congruent layers ( here only two ) of parallel strands in the same plane @xmath0 together with a preferential ranking or ordering of the layers at every point of @xmath0 that does not lie on the boundary of a strand .",
    "the points not on the boundary of a strand are naturally arranged into what are called here _ cells _",
    ", in each of which one strand is uppermost .",
    "the ( parallel ) strands of each layer are perpendicular to those of the other layer , making the cells square .",
    "these square cells are taken here to be of unit area .",
    "the mathematical literature on weaving has concerned exclusively _ periodic _ arrangements in the plane in the standard two - dimensional sense explained by schattschneider @xcite .",
    "there exists a non - unique finite region and two linearly independent translations such that the set of all images of the region , when acted upon by the group generated by these translations , reproduces the original configuration , which is assumed to be infinite in all directions for convenience .",
    "schattschneider gives the name _ unit _ to a smallest region of the plane having the property that the set of its images under this translation group covers the plane .",
    "such units are all of the same area , the _ period _ , but in general can be of a variety of shapes . since our prefabric layers meet at right angles and the symmetry groups with which we shall be concerned here are all rotational ( @xmath1 ) or have axes of reflection or glide - reflection in only parallel or in two perpendicular directions , the _ lattice units _",
    ", that is , period parallelograms whose vertices are all images of a single point under the action of the translation subgroup , can be either rectangular or rhombic ( figure 1 ) .     with an outline of no geometrical significance but its dimensions .",

    "wefts_. the behaviour of each strand in a prefabric is , by isonemality , the same as the behaviour of every other strand ; the periodicity in two dimensions entails periodicity in one dimension along each strand . to distinguish the linear periodicity from the planar",
    ", the period along each strand will be called _",
    "order_. fabrics were catalogued by grnbaum and shephard , sorted first under order , and then by binary index , which is the sequence of pale and dark cells of order length represented by 0s and 1s and chosen to be a minimum , then given an arbitrary sequence number .",
    "the first catalogue @xcite listed fabrics other than twills for orders 2 to 8 ( plus 13 ) and an extension @xcite likewise up to order 12 ( plus 15 and 17 ) .",
    "prefabrics that fall apart were catalogued by hoskins and thomas @xcite for orders 4 to 16numerically the same way but with an asterisk to indicate that they are not fabrics .    the standard way to represent",
    "the preferential ranking of the strands is to regard the plane @xmath0 as viewed from one side , from which viewpoint one or the other strand is visible in each cell . by the _",
    "normal colouring _ of warps dark and wefts pale , the visual appearance of the strands from a particular viewpoint becomes an easily understood code for which strand is uppermost .",
    "this visual appearance from one side ( arbitrarily chosen and called the _ obverse _ ) of the strands we refer to as the _ pattern_. such a pattern , which consists of an array of dark and pale congruent cells tessellating the plane is given a topological meaning , the _ design _ of the prefabric .",
    "as we shall be considering patterns different from the design of a prefabric , the distinction is important ; a design is the pattern of a prefabric that is normally coloured .",
    "so a pattern can be interpreted as a design or not .",
    "normal colouring has a consequence that other colourings of the strands need not have . because at every point not on the boundary of a strand the two strands preferentially ranked are of different colours , a design s colour complement ( switching dark and pale ) is the appearance of the prefabric from behind as though viewed from the obverse side in a mirror set up behind it",
    "this we shall call the _ reverse _ of the prefabric .",
    "when a prefabric is coloured normally the reflected reverse pattern is the colour complement of the obverse pattern .",
    "the distinction between prefabrics and fabrics can now be explained ; a _ fabric _ is a prefabric that _ hangs together _",
    ", that is , that does not _ fall apart _ in the sense that some warps or some wefts or some of each can be lifted off the remainder because they are not bound into a coherent network by the interleaving defined by the preferential ranking .",
    "the most extreme example of a prefabric that falls apart is the trivial prefabric in which all warps pass over all wefts ( uniformly dark diagram ) or all wefts pass over all warps ( uniformly pale diagram ) . in an obvious extension of the notation adopted in the catalogue of genuinely periodic isonemal prefabrics that fall apart @xcite",
    ", the trivial prefabric would be denoted 1 - 0 - 1*.    for isonemal",
    "prefabrics other than his short list of exceptions , all of order less than 5 , roth showed that the symmetry group @xmath12 is a layer group with two - dimensional projection of crystallographic type @xmath13 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath11 , @xmath9 , @xmath14 , @xmath10 , or @xmath1 , that is , it has respectively glide - reflection axes or mirrors or both in parallel directions or glide - reflection axes in perpendicular directions , or glide - reflection axes and axes of reflection in directions perpendicular to each other , or just perpendicular axes of reflection , or both ( alternating ) in both perpendicular directions or just quarter - turns and half - turns . in order for a glide - reflection or quarter - turn to be a symmetry of the prefabric , it may or may not have to be combined with reversal of the sides of the prefabric , @xmath15 , i.e. , reflection in the plane @xmath0 .",
    "mirror symmetry must always be planar reflection combined with @xmath15 because any cell through which the mirror passes must be its own image in the symmetry but the reflection alone , reversing warp and weft , would reverse its conventional colour .",
    "so @xmath15 is needed to restore it .",
    "this means that there is never mirror symmetry in the side - preserving subgroup @xmath16 , which really is two - dimensional ( no @xmath15 ) .",
    "it is @xmath16 that determines the two - dimensional period under translation alone . for these species of prefabric",
    ", @xmath16 is of type @xmath17 , which is generated by translations only , or @xmath7 , which is a group generated by half - turns only , or @xmath13 , @xmath11 , or @xmath1 already characterized .",
    "when @xmath16 is of type @xmath13 , @xmath11 , or @xmath1 it may be the same group as @xmath12 , or it may be a proper subgroup of @xmath12 , or it may be just of the same type as @xmath12 .",
    "there are too many possible geometrical configurations of the symmetry groups and side - preserving subgroups just mentioned to illustrate their lattice units here .",
    "most of them are illustrated in @xcite .",
    "there is are tables in @xcite of which figures in @xcite illustrate which types of group .",
    "figure 1 illustrates a selection in order to show the conventions for the symmetry - group operations .",
    "glide - reflection axes without @xmath15 ( side - preserving ) are hollow dashed lines ( making the central rectangle of figure 1 g ) and with @xmath15 ( side - reversing ) are filled dashed lines ( figures 1c and f ) .",
    "mirrors ( always with @xmath15 ) are filled double lines ( figures 1c , f , and g ) , but if the site of a mirror is also that of an axis of side - preserving glide - reflection the filling of the double lines is dashed ( figure 1b )",
    ". axes of glide - reflection can run through the centres and corners of cells ( _ mirror position , _",
    "figures 1b , 10 , and 20 ) or through the sides of cells instead ( where a mirror can not go , figure 1c ) .",
    "centres of half - turns are represented as @xmath18 and centres of half - turns with @xmath15 as @xmath6 ; centres of quarter - turns as @xmath4 and centres of quarter - turns with @xmath15 as @xmath5 ( figure 7a ) .",
    "thin lines are just boundaries of lattice units , outlining or completing the outline of rectangles or rhombs .",
    "the alternative lattice units outlined in figure 1d are related by having the corners of each as centres of the other .",
    "as the diagram illustrates with a group of roth type 39 ( @xmath19 ) , the corners of the two sorts of lattice unit can be of different kinds .",
    "finally , in figure 1 g four centres of half - turns are illustrated outside the @xmath12 lattice unit to complete a lattice unit with dashed outline of a type-@xmath7 @xmath16 subgroup inside the symmetry group @xmath12 of type @xmath10 .",
    "the subgroup is inside the group , but the lattice unit of the group is inside the lattice unit of the subgroup .",
    "the longer and shorter diagonals of a rhomb will be called its _ length _ and _",
    "width_.    the subject matter now having been introduced , the plan of the paper can be given .",
    "striping , thin and thick , is explained in  2 , and which isonemal prefabrics can be thinly striped to be perfect colourings is determined in terms of richard roth s taxonomy . in ",
    "3 it is determined which of these stripings must always be the design of an _ isonemal _ prefabric that falls apart .",
    "the catalogue of designs of isonemal prefabrics that fall apart is extended to order 20 in  4 .",
    "then in  5 it is shown that not all such designs can be produced by thinly striping an isonemal fabric , correcting an error in @xcite .",
    "thick striping will be further considered elsewhere .",
    "we turn now to the matter of perfect colourings of the strands of a prefabric with two colours , the subject of roth s later weaving paper @xcite .",
    "an introduction to the colouring topic with emphasis on two colours is @xcite .",
    "since the normal colouring of strands , which allows the visual pattern of the coloured strands ( its design ) to represent their topological structure , is a perfect colouring , this idea was more drawn attention to than introduced in @xcite .",
    "a symmetry operation is called a _ colour symmetry _",
    "@xcite ` if it permutes the colors consistently ' .",
    "all the pale strands must be mapped either to pale strands or to dark strands , and correspondingly the dark strands .",
    "if all of the symmetries of a prefabric with coloured strands are colour symmetries , then the choice of the strand colours is said to be _ perfect _ or _ symmetric _ , where i shall use exclusively the former term .",
    "the interaction of design and pattern is important because the relevant symmetry group is that of the prefabric represented by the pattern that is its design , the group of the design for short , but the permutation ( identity or reversal ) of colours occurs only in the pattern that represents the colouring of the strands , identical to the design only with normal colouring of the strands .",
    "there is potential for confusion .",
    "fortunately , since there are only two non - normal ways to colour a prefabric that can result in perfect colouring , it is easy to make this discussion concrete .",
    "warps and wefts can be striped , that is vary pale and dark , either _ thinly _ , that is alternately , or _",
    "thickly _ , that is alternating in pairs : pale , pale , dark , dark , pale , pale . adapting a device from @xcite , the colouring of a prefabric can be represented by seeming to extend strands outside the pattern to indicate which strands are pale or dark .",
    "i adopt this convention as long as it is not completely obvious which strands are which .     10 pt 10 pt 10 pt 10 pt10 pt    \\(a ) 32 pt ( b ) 21 pt ( c ) 30 pt ( d ) 32 pt ( e ) 21 pt ( f )    consider the thin striping of the trivial prefabric 1 - 0 - 1 * , whose design is all pale or all dark . in figures 2a and 2d",
    ", the design of 1 - 0 - 1 * appears all pale with an indication of how the prefabric is to be coloured , to the left of the resulting patterns 2b and 2e , where it is seen that the colouring of the invisible warps is not relevant , and the patterns 2c and 2f , which are the appearances from behind as in a mirror held beyond the the plane of the prefabric . on the reverse side",
    ", it is the colouring of the wefts that is irrelevant , but even this trivial example alerts one to the fact that the reverse is not just the colour reversal of the obverse .",
    "neither can be more important than the other , and so their systematic relation is of interest . where the crossing strands are of the same colour , as in the upper - left and lower - right cells of figure 2a , both obverse and reverse have that colour .",
    "elsewhere the obverse colour is that of the design in pale rows ( short for predominantly pale rows where the weft is pale ) and its complement in dark rows ( short for predominantly dark rows where the weft is dark ) .",
    "the thin striping creates a checkerboard of cells that may be called redundant and irredundant , where the _ redundant _ are those where a colour meets itself and the _ irredundant _ are those where the warp and weft have different colours .",
    "the appearance in irredundant cells is dependent on the design and colouring , in redundant cells only on the colouring .",
    "in this language , the irredundant cells on the reverse have the complement of the design in pale rows and the colour of the design in dark rows , in both cases the complement of the obverse",
    ".     10 pt 10 pt 10 pt 10 pt 10 pt    \\(a ) 32 pt ( b ) 21 pt ( c ) 30 pt ( d ) 32 pt ( e ) 21 pt ( f )    consider the thin striping of the warp and weft of plain weave . because of the interlacing , the different colourings have different results in figures 3b , c , e , f , where again the reverse is shown on the right .",
    "but results are the same three as those for the trivial prefabric in figure 2 , indicating general non - uniqueness of the results of striping strands .",
    "this striping illustrates that the patterns obtained by striping warp and weft of isonemal fabrics are the designs of prefabrics that fall apart ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 3 ) . in consequence of this fact together with the known conditions for isomenal fabrics that fall apart @xcite ,",
    "if the pattern of a fabric obtained by striping warp and weft is the design of an isonemal prefabric , then the prefabric is of genus ii , iv , or v with no overlap with genus i or iii and with one quarter of the cells in half the rows dark .",
    "the pattern arising from the striping of warp and weft of an isonemal fabric does not need to _ be _ the design of an isonemal prefabric as we shall see .",
    "the effect of striping warp and weft thickly is to produce a checkerboard of redundant cells that is plain weave doubled ( box weave 4 - 3 - 1 ) .",
    "if there is to be any hope of perfect colouring , then the colouring , striping , must be chosen so that the colour symmetries of the fabrics map redundant cells to redundant cells and irredundant cells to irredundant cells , or as roth puts it ` preserve ' them .",
    "which half of the cells are to be reduntant and which half are to be irredundant is a choice to be made .",
    "there are therefore two ways to stripe the same fabric thinly . preserving the two classes of cell rules out as symmetries for any striping ,    glide - reflections with axes not in mirror position ,    translations @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 not integers of the same parity , and    half - turns with centres not at the centre or corner of a cell    but",
    "not half - turns with centres in those two positions , not other translations and not mirror symmetries .",
    "it rules out , for thin striping , quarter - turns with centres not at the centre of a cell .",
    "roth has shown @xcite that these modest necessary conditions are also sufficient to allow the two sorts of striping , but not in terms of his symmetry - group types .",
    "when we turn to species without quarter - turns , the glide - reflection constraint alone eliminates species @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , 4 , @xmath27 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , 20 , 24 , @xmath30 , and 32 from being perfectly coloured by striped strands .",
    "perfect colouring by thin striping is possible for the remainder of the species with only parallel axes of symmetry : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , 3 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , 6 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and 9 . as roth points out",
    ", types with @xmath12 of type @xmath11 can have strands thinly striped to produce perfect colouring provided that twice each glide is an even multiple of the cell diagonal @xmath38 .",
    "this is always the case when its axis is in mirror position . as observed in @xcite , the position of glide - reflection axes and the size of glides",
    "are related in such a way that it is unsurprising that the glide - reflections eliminated on the basis of position , those in species 12 , 14 , and 16 , also have glides fractional in @xmath38 .",
    "accordingly , species 11 , 13 , and 15 are always stripable .",
    "roth also points out that designs with @xmath12 of type @xmath9 allow thin striping with the same constraint on glides , since reflection is always a colour symmetry .",
    "this permits thin striping for species 17 , @xmath39 ( s for stripable thinly ) , 19 , 21 , 22 , and 23 , but not @xmath28 , @xmath29 , 20 , and 24 , already banned .",
    "a similar blanket permission is for @xmath12 of type @xmath14 , that is types 25 and 26 , since they have only reflections .",
    "when @xmath12 is of type @xmath10 , the stripability depends on the translations generated by the mirrors and glide - reflections , which are correctly located except in species 32 , already banned .",
    "the translations are the diagonals of the central rectangle as in figure 1f , and their components must have the same parity .",
    "both the odd - odd and even - even spacings of roth type 27 , which are used also in species 29 and 30 , and the odd - even spacing of species @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the former used again in species 31 , allow the use of striping .",
    "so we have seen what can be stated as a theorem , essentially proved in @xcite .",
    "isonemal periodic prefabrics of order greater than @xmath42 and of every species with symmetry axes that is not ruled out by the placement of glide - reflections can be perfectly coloured by thin striping : @xmath43 , @xmath44@xmath45@xmath46 , and @xmath47@xmath48    isonemal periodic prefabrics of order greater than @xmath42 with quarter - turn symmetry can be perfectly coloured by thin striping if and only if they are of species @xmath49 .    the type specifications @xmath49 correspond exactly to the conditions for thin striping of a prefabric with @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "( this theorem is a second reason for the choice of subscript . )",
    "it is a curiosity that the only perfect colourings illustrated in @xcite are normally coloured designs .",
    "it is surely of interest to see what non - normal perfect colourings look like . to satisfy this curiosity , fabrics of each of the species with only parallel axes of symmetry",
    "will be described or displayed perfectly coloured by thin striping .",
    "the fabrics shown in figures 12a , 14c , and 2a of @xcite to illustrate species @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 respectively become non - isonemal designs both ways they are striped thinly .",

    "one observes that irredundant cells are invariant under translations of multiples of @xmath72 parallel to the axes as well as glide - reflections with glide @xmath72 , but the redundant cells containing the axes are invariant under translations of only multiples of @xmath76 along the axes because moving @xmath72 they are complemented .",
    "the period rectangle ( lattice unit ) must be @xmath77 by @xmath76 , and so , no matter how the rest of the redundant cells are filled in , the period rectangle can not be made smaller .",
    "the species-6 design is isonemal because the lattice unit of @xmath12 is @xmath77 by @xmath72 , 4 and 5 being relatively prime .",
    "the design partly produced can not be isonemal because it is shaping up to be of species @xmath31 with lattice unit being @xmath77 by @xmath76 .",
    "the standard isonemality constraint of @xcite is violated .",
    "( the translations under which it is invariant having those sizes in perpendicular directions , there is no transformation from strand to adjacent strand , as can be seen for the irredundant cells of , for example , the bottom two rows of figure 20a . )",
    "we must conclude that theorem 2 of @xcite is false and that the algorithm on which it is based does not always work either as stated there or improved here .",
    "the improved algorithm works when it can work , but the counterexample of figure 20 shows that no procedure can always work .",
    "work on this material has been done at home and at wolfson college , oxford .",
    "richard roth helped with the understanding of his papers .",
    "will gibson made it possible for me to draw the diagrams with surprising ease from exclusively keyboard input . to them both and wolfson college i make grateful acknowledgement .",
