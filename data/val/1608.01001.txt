    "although the conservation of energy and momentum of electromagnetic fields in vacuum is a very well understood problem , inside a polarizable medium it is still a matter of discussion .",
    "a review of the literature on this subject can be found in @xcite .    in the vacuum , poynting s equation for the exchange of energy between the field and free charges is easily derived starting from lorentz s force density on charges and currents @xmath2 and from the power density on the currents @xmath3 the resulting equation @xmath4 written in terms of @xmath5 and @xmath6 is an identity valid for any solution of maxwell s equations .",
    "it is interpreted as a local energy conservation equation by taking @xmath7 as the energy density of the electromagnetic field and poynting s vector @xmath8 as the energy flux current vector . the power exerted by the matter on the fields",
    "is assumed to be the opposite of ( [ power - density ] ) .",
    "electromagnetic fields also carry momentum .",
    "the derivation of the equation for the momentum exchange requires the use of maxwell s stress tensor and a somewhat more involved calculation which do not make easy an elementary presentation of the subject . in many textbooks ( e.g @xcite , @xcite )",
    "radiation pressure is simply introduced as a new fact , sometimes referring to it as one of maxwell s achievements . in the vacuum",
    "the momentum density is accepted to be @xmath9 which leads to the relation @xmath10 for the energy and momentum that an electromagnetic wave releases when absorbed .",
    "because of this in other elementary presentations ( e.g @xcite ) the density of momentum ( [ momentum - density ] ) is justified by working on the analogy with a relativistic particle , whose momentum and energy are related by @xmath11 for an ultra relativistic particle ( @xmath12 ) holds @xmath13 by assuming that this last relation is also valid for a packet of electromagnetic waves traveling in some direction , one gets ( [ deltap ] ) and therefore @xmath14 in accord with ( [ momentum - density ] ) .",
    "this procedure has the shortcoming of having a non electromagnetic element , the relativistic particle , introduced in the discussion .",
    "a more enlighting treatment of the subject is the one presented for example in ref.@xcite .",
    "there , the interaction of electromagnetic wave packets coming from vacuum with electric currents in a non ideal conductor are considered .",
    "the impulse transferred to the currents is computed and showed to be consistent with ( [ momentum - density ] ) and ( [ deltap ] ) . in this paper we show that this same idea can also be applied to the propagation of light in matter .",
    "as we already commented , what happens with momentum inside matter is still not completely clear from the theoretical point of view . for the energy ,",
    "poynting @xcite proposed that eq.([poynting - eq ] ) remains valid with @xmath15 and @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is the free current density , @xmath18 is the electric displacement and @xmath19 is the magnetizing field .",
    "it may be shown that eq.([poynting - eq ] ) is consistent with maxwell s equations only for materials with linear polarizations , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "in particular it holds for a material with permittivity @xmath22 and permeability @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25\\mathbf{b}$ ] , but it also holds in the more general situation of a non - isotropic material .",
    "poynting s density is the vacuum energy density @xmath7 plus terms that depend on the polarization @xmath26 and the magnetization @xmath27 , @xmath28 the electric term corresponds to the energy density of deformation of matter as it develops electric dipole moments .",
    "the magnetic term is the work density made on microscopic currents by the induced electric field .",
    "the work done on electric and magnetic moments is already included in poynting s energy density , that is the reason why in the right hand side of equation ( [ poynting - eq ] ) only the power of the free current density appears . in other words , for an electromagnetic wave in a material medium , poynting s expression corresponds to the energy density of the whole wave , including the change of energy of matter as the wave propagates in the medium .    for the momentum density of the fields in matter",
    "the situation is less clear .",
    "there is a dispute that has lasted more than a century @xcite on the subject .",
    "minkowski @xcite proposed @xmath29 which for individual photons corresponds to using ( [ particle - momentum - ultra ] ) replacing @xmath30 by the speed of light in matter @xmath31 .",
    "this was challenged by abraham @xcite who proposed instead @xmath32 which for photons corresponds to using directly ( [ particle - momentum ] ) .    to shed some light on this issue ,",
    "in this paper we study a simple example that can be solved exactly .",
    "it consists of a packet of plane waves propagating in a material with permeability @xmath23 and permittivity @xmath22 .",
    "the medium being homogeneous there is no refraction and the wave travels conserving momentum and energy . inside the material there is a flat thin film of conducting material in which ohm s law holds , @xmath33 .",
    "when the wave packet falls on the film it splits in reflected and transmitted packets , whose amplitudes are fixed by the boundary conditions ( see figure [ [ paquetes ] ] ) . the total work done on the currents in the conducting film can be calculated using ( [ power - density ] ) .",
    "the result is consistent with poynting s energy density ( [ poynting - density ] ) .",
    "also , the impulse on the currents of the film can be calculated using ( [ force - density ] ) .",
    "we found that the result is consistent with momentum conservation only if the momentum carried by the waves is given by minkowski s expression ( [ minkowski ] ) .",
    "consider a medium with electric and magnetic permeabilities @xmath22 and @xmath23 filling the space . at the plane @xmath34 there is a sheet of thickness @xmath35 made of a conductive material of resistivity @xmath36 . a packet of electromagnetic plane waves polarized in the direction @xmath37 is traveling in the @xmath38 direction .",
    "suppose it has a spatial length @xmath39 with @xmath40 , @xmath41 a time scale , and a wave length @xmath42 such that @xmath43 and @xmath44 . in terms of a suitable function @xmath45 which vanishes outside the interval @xmath46 $ ]",
    "the incident wave is , @xmath47 the reflected and transmitted waves are , @xmath48 and @xmath49 at @xmath34 @xmath50 is continuous , @xmath51 implying @xmath52        there is an electrical current in the sheet .",
    "the magnetic field is discontinuous at @xmath34 .",
    "taking a rectangular path of length @xmath53 in the @xmath54 direction and width @xmath35 in the @xmath38 direction we have , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the plane surface with boundary @xmath57 ( see figure [ [ camino ] ] ) . the second integral vanishes because the width of the surface is negligible .",
    "the current density is @xmath58 substituting this in the previous equation we have @xmath59 and @xmath60 introducing @xmath61 and solving the system we have , @xmath62 the energy of the wave is given by poynting s expression @xmath63 for @xmath64 we consider a cylindrical piece of the incident packet with axis parallel to @xmath38 and cross section @xmath65 .",
    "the energy is , @xmath66 where @xmath67 for @xmath68 the energies of the reflected and transmitted waves are , @xmath69 ^ 2u_1\\ , \\\\",

    "we compute first the force applied on the sheet .",
    "the force density on the current is @xmath74 in the approximation where @xmath35 is infinitesimal , the current density in the sheet , @xmath75 , is constant because the electric field is continuous .",
    "the magnetic field then varies linearly between its values at both sides of the sheet . in computing the total force one",
    "has to take the average on the sheet volume .",
    "for @xmath76 we have @xmath77 where @xmath78\\nonumber\\\\   & = & \\frac{h(t)}{v}e_1\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting this in ( [ force ] ) and using ( [ currentdensity ] ) and ( [ solution ] ) we get",
    "@xmath79 the impulse applied to the current sheet is @xmath80    the momentum carried by the wave is directed in the same direction in which the wave propagates , that is , the direction of @xmath81 .",
    "the momentum density of the wave may be written in the form , @xmath82 with @xmath83 a constant to be determined .",
    "for @xmath84 the momentum density is minkowski s and for @xmath85 it is abraham s .",
    "then , the momentum carried by the incident wave is @xmath86 analogously @xmath87 for the balance equation we get , @xmath88 momentum is conserved if @xmath84 . the momentum density",
    "( [ momden ] ) turns out to be minkowski s expression , @xmath89    the key in the previous argument is the factor @xmath90 that appears in the impulse ( [ applimp ] ) .",
    "this can be traced back to the magnetic force in lorentz s force ( [ force - density ] ) and the relationship between the magnetic and electric amplitudes in electromagentic waves .",
    "this relation is a consequence of maxwell s equations . for obtaining abraham s result the factor",
    "should have been @xmath91 .",
    "the calculation presented in this paper assumes the validity of maxwell s equations and lorentz s force density on the conduction current . using the properties of the electromagnetic wave solutions of maxwell s equations in a simple setup we showed that momentum conservation requires the use of minkowski s expression for the momentum density of the electromagnetic field in a linear medium .",
    "although the use of the explicit solution of maxwell equations with boundary conditions puts our approach a little ahead of most introductory physics university courses it is still a very simple and elementary construction which allows the discussion of electromagnetic momentum in material media in a self - consistent way . in particular",
    "it also may be used to treat the case when the wave propagates in the vacuum .",
