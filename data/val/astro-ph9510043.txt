    "gravitational lensing is now a well established field of astronomy , with a wide variety of astrophysical and cosmological applications . among the many interesting and important implications of lensing phenomena",
    "is the possibility of interference effects between lensed images of point - like astrophysical sources ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if the angular separation of the images of a point - like source is comparable to the wavelength of the light , interference between the lensed images will lead to a distinctive fringe pattern both in coordinate space and in energy spectrum .",
    "the interference pattern in the energy spectrum will depend upon the location of the detector .",
    "since well separated detectors will see different patterns , there is a distinctive signature of the effect .",
    "if gamma - ray bursters are of cosmological origin they would be small enough to act as point - like sources , and lenses of extremely small masses , @xmath2 , ( @xcite ) . ]",
    "would produce a frequency - dependent signal in their spectrum ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "for source and lens at cosmological distances , the angular separation of the images would be in the femto - arcsec range , so the phenomenon was dubbed `` femtolensing '' by gould ( 1992 ) .",
    "for source and lens of cosmological distances , the einstein ring radius is @xmath3 cm .",
    "this means that if two gamma - ray burst detectors are separated by distances larger than @xmath4 , typically one detector will be within the einstein ring and the other will not .",
    "measurement of different fluxes in two widely separated detectors would extend the detectable range of lens masses to @xmath5 ( @xcite ) , which can be called picolensing .",
    "thus , femtolensing and picolensing could be a probe of dark matter in a mass range difficult to probe by other means , not to mention settle the issue of the origin of gamma - ray bursters .",
    "although the phenomenon of femtolensing ( henceforth we omit picolensing for brevity , but everywhere below we mean both phenomena ) is quite intriguing , the possibility has not attracted a great deal of attention because of a lack of attractive femtolens candidates . among the front runners in an admittedly weak field",
    "are snowballs , black holes , and small molecular clouds .",
    "snowballs ( lumps of primordial h and he ) are generally believed to evaporate on time scales shorter than the hubble time ( @xcite ) and for this reason they are not very attractive .",
    "a significant fraction of closure density in black holes in the requisite mass range seems difficult to arrange without a very peculiar spectrum of primordial fluctuations to prevent too many small holes which would be evaporating now . as an unattractive possibility in a field of even more unpalatable choices , small molecular clouds",
    "are usually considered the best bet for femtolensing .",
    "even if one thought of a way to arrange baryons into femto - mass objects , it is unlikely that they would contribute a large enough fraction of closure density for a reasonable optical depth for femtolensing .",
    "even if _ all _ baryonic matter would form femtolenses , their density is constrained by big - bang nucleosynthesis to be less than about 10% of closure density .",
    "since non - baryonic dark matter is expected to dominate the mass density of the universe , perhaps it is easier to arrange a near critical density of _ non - baryonic _ material into objects capable of femtolensing .",
    "but most particle dark matter candidates are very weakly interacting , and they would not be expected to clump on the femtolensing mass and density scales .    in this paper",
    "we shall show that the situation may be different if axions are the dark matter . here",
    "we outline a scenario where a significant cosmological density of axion miniclusters ( @xcite ; @xcite , 1994a ) form with the necessary properties to be natural candidates both for femto- and picolensing .",
    "the invisible axion is among the best motivated candidates for cosmic dark matter .",
    "the axion ( @xcite ; @xcite ) is the pseudo - nambu  goldstone boson resulting from the spontaneous breaking of a @xmath6 global symmetry known as the peccei ",
    "quinn , or pq , symmetry introduced to explain the apparent smallness of strong cp - violation in qcd ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are stringent astrophysical ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and cosmological ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) constraints on the properties of the axion . in particular ,",
    "the combination of cosmological and astrophysical considerations restrict the axion decay constant @xmath7 and the axion mass @xmath8 to be in the narrow windows @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "the contribution to the mean density of the universe from axions in this window is guaranteed to be cosmologically significant .",
    "thus , if axions exist , they will be dynamically important in the present evolution of the universe .",
    "the axion is effectively massless well above the qcd confinement temperature of a few hundred mev . at the confinement scale and below",
    ", qcd effects produce a potential for the axion of the form @xmath11 $ ] , where the axion field was parametrised as a dimensionless angular variable @xmath12 . above the qcd scale",
    "there is no reason for the axion field to be at its low - temperature potential minimum , so as the axion potential turns on the field must relax to the minimum of the potential .",
    "thus the energy density in axions corresponds to coherent scalar field oscillations , driven by a displacement of the initial value of the field ( the `` misalignment '' angle ) away from the eventual minimum of the temperature - dependent potential .",
    "there will be nothing special in the subsequent evolution of the axion field if the initial misalignment angle is constant throughout the universe .",
    "this may in fact be a reasonable picture if the universe underwent inflation with the `` re - heat '' temperature well below @xmath7 . however , equally plausible early - universe scenarios lead to fluctuations of order unity in the misalignment angle on scales larger than the hubble radius as the potential starts to develop . since the final energy density depends upon the initial misalignment angle , spatial fluctuations in the misalignment angle",
    "are transformed into spatial fluctuations in the axion density , which later lead to tiny gravitationally bound `` miniclusters . ''",
    "it is easy to understand that miniclusters will be very dense objects .",
    "background axion density scales with temperature as @xmath13 for @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the entropy density and @xmath16 is the temperature of equal matter and radiation energy densities .",
    "consider a region with axion over - density , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is larger than unity .",
    "the matter density in that region will dominate the radiation density at a temperature @xmath19 . at this time the density fluctuation became non - linear , separate out from the cosmological expansion , gravitationally collapse , relax , and form a minicluster with the approximate density it had at @xmath20 .",
    "a detailed study of this leads to a final minicluster density of ( @xcite ) @xmath21 even a relatively small increase in @xmath18 is important because the final density depends upon @xmath22 for @xmath23 .    in hogan & rees ( 1988 )",
    "it was assumed that typical values of @xmath18 corresponding to a minicluster are of order unity .",
    "the typical mass of a minicluster in hogan & rees ( 1988 ) was assumed to correspond to the mass of all axions inside the horizon at @xmath24 mev , with the result @xmath25 .    in our numerical investigations of the dynamics of the axion field around the qcd epoch ( @xcite , 1994a ) we found that as the oscillations commence , important , previously neglected , non - linear effects of the field self - interaction can result in the formation of transient soliton - like objects we called axitons .",
    "the non - linear effects result in regions with @xmath18 much larger than unity , possibly as large as several hundred , leading to enormous minicluster densities .",
    "we also found that the minicluster mass scale is set by the total mass in axions within the hubble radius at a temperature around @xmath26 gev when axion mass is equal to @xmath27 .",
    "this lowers the minicluster mass from the estimate of hogan and rees to about @xmath28 .",
    "our previous calculations suggested that miniclusters could be a candidate for femtolensing .",
    "we have since extended and improved our original calculation of the properties of axion miniclusters using the same approach as in @xcite , but with better numerical resolution and using a different spectrum of initial fluctuations of @xmath12 .",
    "the new calculation confirmed the basic picture of minicluster formation and sharpened the predictions of the masses , radii , and abundance of miniclusters . in the next section",
    "we summarize the results relevant for femtolensing .",
    "the evolution of the axion field in an expanding , spatially flat universe during the epoch when axion mass switches on is governed by a wave - like equation with a non - linear , time - dependent potential ( @xcite ) : @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the conformal time ( normalized to @xmath33 when the inverse of the axion mass is equal to the hubble radius  i.e . ,",
    "@xmath34 ) , and @xmath35 is the laplacian with respect to comoving coordinates .",
    "the factor of @xmath36 in this equation arises from the way the potential develops due to instanton effects : @xmath37 , with @xmath38 ( @xcite ) .    as an initial conditions in the new calculation we considered the possibility that the main source of axions is provided by the decay of axion strings prior to @xmath39",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this might be expected if the reheating temperature after inflation is larger than the temperature of the peccei - quinn phase transition .",
    "in such a scenario the spectral energy density of axions produced by string decay corresponds to a power law : @xmath40 , where @xmath41 ( recall that the axion effectively is massless prior to @xmath42 ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath43 for the fourier amplitudes of the axion field . in our latest calculations we used initial conditions at @xmath42 with amplitudes of the fourier modes corresponding to the above spectrum and with random phases .",
    "overall amplitude was chosen to ensure rms value of @xmath12 to be @xmath44 .    the final density distribution of axions in one of the 2-dimensional slices through the integration volume is shown in figure 1 .",
    "three high amplide density peaks which are seen on this figure results from non - linear interaction and are absent in the case of the harmonic potential .",
    "they form miniclusters of interest at @xmath45 .",
    "the evolution of the axion field with the above initial conditions was qualitatively similar to the evolution using the white - noise initial conditions of our previous calculations . from the results of the numerical calculation we determined the mass , radius , and abundance of axion miniclusters .",
    "minicluster mass .",
    "_ the mass of axion minicluster is set by the scale when axion oscillations commence . as mentioned above ,",
    "we have defined @xmath46 as a temperature when the axion mass equals the hubble constant , @xmath47 . using results of turner ( 1986 ) we use @xmath48 gev . in what follows",
    "we assume @xmath49 gev . as a reference mass scale",
    "we define the mass of all axions in a cubic volume of length equal to the hubble length at @xmath46 , and density equal to the mean cosmological density : @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the number of an effectively massless degrees of freedom at temperature @xmath46 . using @xmath52 we find @xmath53 .",
    "our numerical integration of equation ( [ eq3 ] ) shows that there is a spectrum of minicluster masses , but typically the mass of the axion minicluster is a reasonable fraction of @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "we estimate the average minicluster mass to be of order @xmath56 .",
    "masses of miniclusters are relatively insensitive to the particular value of @xmath18 associated with the minicluster .",
    "minicluster radius .",
    "_ typical axion miniclusters have a large density contrast , @xmath57 ( @xcite ) , see figure 1 .",
    "equation ( [ rhofl ] ) gives the minicluster radius as a function of @xmath58 and @xmath18 : @xmath59    the radius of a particular minicluster depends upon its associated value of @xmath18 . in the limit @xmath23 the radius of a minicluster scales as @xmath60 .",
    "minicluster abundance .",
    "_ from the numerical calculation we have extracted the mass fraction of axions in density peaks of @xmath18 larger than a given value @xmath61 .",
    "it is plotted for several values of conformal time @xmath62 and @xmath63 in figure 2 . by the time @xmath64",
    "we are no longer able reliably to resolve the highest density peaks because density contrasts became too large for our @xmath65 grid .",
    "although at @xmath66 the evolution has not completely frozen out , ( especially at the large-@xmath18 end ) we can set a lower bound for the density fractions , e.g. , more than 13% are in miniclusters with @xmath67 and 70% of all axionic dark matter are in miniclusters @xmath68 , see figure 2 .",
    "for axion miniclusters ( or , for that matter , any other possible candidate ) to be detected by femtolensing ( or picolensing ) the following three conditions must be satisfied :      _ ii . ) _ the physical radius of the minicluster has to be smaller than its einstein ring radius",
    ". for source and lens of cosmological distance the einstein ring radius is , see e.g. press & gunn ( 1973 ) : @xmath71 where as usual @xmath72 km s@xmath73mpc@xmath73 .",
    "_ iii . ) _ the third condition is that a significant fraction of the total mass density of the universe must be in the form of miniclusters , say @xmath74 , for the lensing rate to be reasonable .",
    "this condition is independent upon the lens mass ( @xcite ) .",
    "these conditions are non - trivial , which is why there were no serious candidates for femtolensing .",
    "but we shall now demonstrate that all three conditions are naturally met for the case of axion miniclusters .    that miniclusters satisfy the mass condition follows from the fact that the minicluster mass is determined by the total mass of axions within the hubble radius at @xmath75 gev .",
    "of course there will be some spread in minicluster masses , but as discussed in the previous section , the masses should be peaked around @xmath28 , well within the desired range for lensing .    using the radius of miniclusters from equation ( [ r ] ) and the einstein ring radius from equation ( [ re ] ) , we find @xmath76 .",
    "the requirement that miniclusters be smaller than their einstein ring radius places restrictions on @xmath18 as a function of @xmath58",
    ". we see that if @xmath77 , then miniclusters with @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( depending upon @xmath80 ) are within their einstein ring radius .",
    "actually , objects with the radius comparable to their einstein radius have a better chance to be detected as femtolenses ( compared to point mass objects ) if they are in the mass range @xmath81 ( @xcite ) . from figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we see that more than about 20% of all dark matter axions are in miniclusters with @xmath82 and will be within their ring radius .",
    "we conclude that if axions are the dark matter with @xmath83 close to unity , then the fraction of @xmath84 in miniclusters capable of femtolensing is 15% - 20% ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , i. e. will be in excess of 10%large enough to result in a detectable rate .",
    "since miniclusters in the igm as well as in galactic halos contribute to femtolensing events , questions such as : how are they clustered , do miniclusters survive the epoch of galaxy formation , are they disrupted in their encounters with stars , etc .",
    ", may be irrelevant here .",
    "since large-@xmath18 miniclusters are very dense , form early , and are well separated from each other , they should escape mutual disruption and merging .",
    "we conclude that axion miniclusters are candidates for femtolensing and picolensing .",
    "we do not believe that the conclusion is sensitive to specific initial conditions , but is generic so long as there are large super - horizon - sized fluctuations in the misalignment angle during the development of the axion potential ."
