    "the velocity of a classical object , requiring two position measurements , is trivially implemented in many apparati which control our daily activity . on the contrary , in the quantum world , such measurements are much more complicated .",
    "the first position measurement implies a perturbation on the quantum system so that the knowledge of the velocity without perturbation is hardly accessible .",
    "one can minimize the back - action of the measurement on the system using weak measurements .",
    "such measurements were initially developed by aharonov , albert and vaidman ( aav ) @xcite more than two decades ago and they are receiving increasing attention @xcite nowadays . as a relevant example , the spatial distribution of _ velocities _ of relativistic photons in a double slit scenario has been measured , and the associated quantum trajectories reconstructed @xcite . however , we may ask the question : _ does the ensemble velocity obtained from weak measurements have a clear physical meaning ? _ a partial answer was provided recently by wiseman @xcite . using the weak aav value @xcite",
    ", he showed that the ensemble velocity constructed from an arbitrarily pre - selected state and a post - selected position eigenstate , with an infinitesimal temporal separation between position measurements , exactly corresponds to the bohmian velocity @xcite of the unperturbed state .",
    "note that wiseman s answer is only valid for non - relativistic scenarios ( thus , strictly speaking , excluding @xcite ) .",
    "we emphasize that two weak position measurements on an individual state do not provide the bohmian velocity because of the unavoidable back - action @xcite .",
    "however , for an idealized scenario , wiseman showed that when the individual measurements are repeated over an ensemble of identical states , the final ensemble velocity is identical to the bohmian velocity of the unperturbed state @xcite .",
    "these ensemble velocities can be interpreted either as the orthodox hydrodynamic velocity @xcite or as a genuine measurement of the bohmian velocity @xcite .",
    "following the recent literature @xcite , we will refer to these ensemble velocities as bohmian velocities , however the adjectives _",
    "bohmian _ and _ hydrodynamic _ are fully interchangeable in this work .",
    "the practical conditions for measuring bohmian velocities in a laboratory are different from the idealized theoretical scenario studied by wiseman @xcite ( implying discrepancies between the measured velocity and the expected one ) .",
    "weak _ measurements in a laboratory can be outside the linear - response regime assumed in the aav development @xcite .",
    "second , position measurements have a small but finite uncertainty , meaning that the post - selected state is not an exact position eigenstate .",
    "third , the time - separation between measurements must be finite . in this paper",
    "we bring the original wiseman s conclusions about the measurement of bohmian velocities into practical laboratory conditions , free from previous idealized assumptions .",
    "we will use the positive operator valued measure ( povm ) framework @xcite ( instead of the aav value ) allowing positions uncertainties in both measurements and we will consider a finite time interval between position measurements .",

    "after properly modeling the system perturbation due to the measurement , both probabilities can be computed .",
    "the povm appears as a natural modeling of a measuring process @xcite when the laboratory is divided into the quantum system and the rest ( including the measuring apparatus ) .",
    "thus , the perturbation of the state due to the measurement of the first position @xmath1 can be defined through povms . in this treatment",
    "we chose the gaussian measurement krauss operators @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the experimental uncertainty .",
    "the measured position @xmath1 belongs to the set @xmath16 of all possible measurement outputs of the apparatus . for simplicity",
    ", we assume @xmath17 in a 1d system , being the extension to the 3d spatial domain straightforward . then , the normalization coefficient @xmath18 is fixed by the condition @xmath19 . due to the unavoidable uncertainty on any position measurement , we consider an equivalent operator for the second position measurement of @xmath3 : @xmath20 we remark here that the choice of gaussian measurement operators is not the only possible one that leads to our results .",
    "in fact , it can be proven that any povm that weakly perturbs the wave function only in a neighborhood of @xmath1 ( @xmath3 ) of radius @xmath15 ( @xmath21 ) , and _ cancels _ the wave function in any other position leads to equivalent results .",
    "thus the choice of gaussian povm is purely formal .",
    "it allows a simple analytical treatment .",
    "now , using the definitions in ( [ w ] ) and ( [ s ] ) , we can compute @xmath12 and @xmath13 from the born rule , as : @xmath22 being @xmath23 the initial state . strictly speaking , contrarily to the aav expression @xcite",

    "whether or not the gaussian - spatially - averaged value ( [ velobohm_s ] ) is identical to the bohmian velocity depends on the measuring apparatus resolution , i.e. @xmath21 , and the de broglie wavelength @xmath65 associated to @xmath24 . under the limit",

    "> from the definition of velocity in ( [ vexp ] ) , one could reasonably expect to get a value associated to the velocity _ averaged _ during the time interval @xmath28 and associated to a _",
    "perturbed _ wave function .",
    "however , under the conditions ( [ lim ] ) and ( [ lim2 ] ) , the result ( [ velobohm ] ) is clearly identified as the _ instantaneous _ ( bohmian ) velocity associated with an _ unperturbed _ wave function at the final time @xmath77 .",
    "the mathematical reasons leading to ( [ velobohm ] ) are fully detailed in the previous calculations . here",
    ", we try to provide some physical insights .",
    "it is well known that a measurement process induces a perturbation on the wave function , breaking the symmetry in its time evolution . in our case , because of the imposed conditions ( [ lim ] ) and ( [ lim2 ] ) , the roles of the first and second measurements are very different .",
    "the condition ( [ lim ] ) implies that the first measurement perturbs very weakly the wave function in a neighborhood @xmath78 of radius @xmath15 around @xmath1 , while the second limit ( [ lim2 ] ) implies a very strong perturbation of the wave function during the second measurement process . as a result , when constructing ( [ vexp ] ) , only the position eigenstates belonging to @xmath78 ( where the wave function remains mainly _ unperturbed _ by the first measurement ) are used .",
    "in fact , the ensemble average ( [ aav1 ] ) has no memory of the first measurement process ( i.e. , of the first povm ) .",
    "moreover , the condition of flat potential between the two measurements that leads to eq .",
    "( [ commutator ] ) implies explicit independence of @xmath28 because it provides _ free _ evolution of the _ unperturbed _ wave function . in this regard",
    ", the first measurement does not actually break the symmetry .",
    "the obvious consequence ( supported by our calculation ) is that the velocity in ( [ vexp ] ) is independent of the time @xmath28 between the two measurements .",
    "finally , since the symmetry is broken essentially by the second measurement , the velocity that we obtain is the one associated with an _ unperturbed _ wave function at the last time @xmath77 .",
    "another way of explaining our results is by noticing that the identity ( [ commutator ] ) can be used for a finite @xmath28 because we assume that the potential is flat at the spatial region where the wave function is different from zero .",
    "for a classical system evolving under a flat potential from @xmath2 till @xmath4 , the instantaneous velocity at @xmath77 is exactly equal to the averaged velocity during @xmath28 .",
    "the classical velocity remains constant during this time interval because the classical acceleration is zero . in the quantum counterpart , from ehrenfest theorem , we know that the ensemble momentum with a flat potential is constant during @xmath79 . using the limit ( [ lim ] ) , the ensemble momentum can be defined as @xmath80 which corresponds to ( [ nolabel ] ) without performing the second measurement .",
    "this again justifies why the resulting velocity evaluated with our protocol is independent of @xmath28 and exactly equal to the ( bohmian ) velocity measured at @xmath77 .",
    "let us now compute the velocity variance . since @xmath3 and @xmath28 are fixed in eq.([vexp ] ) , @xmath81 .",
    "thus , @xmath82-(e[x_w|x_s])^2 $ ] where @xmath83 $ ] defined in eq.([cond ] ) is obtained from eq.([velobohm ] ) .",

    "the main conclusion extracted from fig.[tau_sigma_w ] is that a large set of parameters ( large @xmath123 values ) allows a very accurate measurement of the bohmian velocity , justifying the robustness of our proposal .    at this point",
    ", we emphasize some relevant issues .",
    "first , we have shown theoretically and numerically that the bohmian velocity of an unperturbed state under general laboratory conditions can be obtained from two povm measurements separated by a finite @xmath28 .",
    "unlike the results derived from the aav formulation @xcite , the limits ( [ lim ] ) and ( [ lim2 ] ) provide a simple quantitative explanation of the experimental conditions for an accurate and robust measurement of the bohmian velocity .",
    "on the other hand , the error @xmath124 in ( [ errors ] ) has a term that diverges as @xmath120 , meaning that a @xmath28 close to zero will produce an inaccurate measurement of the velocity for finite @xmath21 .",
    "this regime is reported in the right inset of fig.[tau_sigma_s ] .",
    "roughly speaking , for @xmath36 , the wave packet moves a distance @xmath125 .",
    "when @xmath126 the measured position @xmath3 has no relation to the velocity .",
    "we emphasize again that wiseman s result @xcite does not suffer from this inaccuracy because he considers , both , @xmath35 and @xmath36",
    ".    a closer look at the expressions ( [ errorw ] ) and ( [ errors ] ) shows that the error diverges when @xmath127 has oscillations with minima tending to zero .",
    "this can be clearly seen in fig.[vel](a ) and ( a ) where the highest peak of the velocity corresponds to a minimum of @xmath127 very close to zero .",
    "this situation is reversed when we evaluate the current @xmath107 [ see fig.[vel](b ) and ( b ) ] .",
    "in fact , in these critical points , @xmath128 and even the corresponding errors become very small . in fig.[tau_sigma_s ] it is evident the shift of the @xmath129 region due to this error reduction .",
    "perhaps , the most surprising feature of our protocol is that a local ( in time and position ) bohmian velocity can be measured with a large temporal separation between measurements , while one would expect a time - averaged value as discussed at the end of section [ sec_velocity ] .",
    "this is highly counter - intuitive because we are in a scenario where the time - evolving interferences implies large acceleration of the bohmian particle in order to rapidly avoid the nodes of the wave function .",
    "finally , another relevant result is that the accuracy of the bohmian velocity is obtained at the prize of increasing the dispersion on @xmath1 ( as seen in eq.([var ] ) for large @xmath15 ) .",
    "therefore , the fact that we can obtain the bohmian velocity is not because the system remains unperturbed after one position measurement , rather because of the ability of the ensemble average done in the @xmath1 integrals on eq.([prob1 ] ) and eq.([prob2 ] ) to compensate for the different perturbations .",
    "the fact that a very large perturbation of the state is fully compatible with a negligible error can be easily seen in our numerical data .",
    "the _ measured _ state is roughly equal to the product of the unperturbed wave function ( whose support is @xmath130 nm at time @xmath131ps in fig.[vel ] ) by a gaussian function centered at the measured position with a dispersion equal to @xmath15 ( for example , @xmath132 nm for @xmath117ps in fig.[tau_sigma_w ] ) . even for @xmath133 ( i.e. a large perturbation ) , the velocity error is negligible in fig.[tau_sigma_w ] .",
    "the work presented here explains a protocol for measuring bohmian velocities .",
    "it is based on using an ensemble of two position measurements separated by a finite time interval .",
    "the perturbation of each position measurements on the state is modeled by a povm .",
    "the difference between the bohmian velocity of the unperturbed state and the ensemble bohmian velocity of the two - times measured state is predicted to be much smaller than @xmath0 in a large range of parameters .",
    "the work clarifies the laboratory conditions necessary for measuring bohmian velocities , while relaxing the experimental setup by allowing reasonable position uncertainties and a finite time interval between measurements .",
    "following the same ideas presented in this work ( with two povm for position measurements ) an equivalent analysis for the case of combined povm momentum plus povm position measurements can be carried out for particles with mass .",
    "this case , experimentally tested also for relativistic photons @xcite , could be of major interest for several experiments . in this sense",
    ", a clear and feasible proposal has been recently presented for the demonstration of the nonlocal character of bohmian mechanics by measuring the ensemble velocities of path - entangled particles @xcite . finally , as mentioned in the introduction ,",
