    "the ch ground state , hyperfine , main line ( @xmath0 , j = 1/2 , f = 1 - 1 ) at 3335 mhz is a good , though seldom used , tracer of low - density molecular gas ( @xmath8 10@xmath9 - 10@xmath6 @xmath7 - magnani et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) .",
    "one of the earliest surveys of the ch 3 ghz lines , j = 1/2 lambda - doubling transition consists of 3 hyperfine structure components : the f = 1 - 1 main line at 3335 mhz , and the f = 0 - 1 and 1 - 0 satellite lines at 3264 and 3349 mhz , respectively . ] by rydbeck et al .",

    "the ch 3 ghz lines are nearly ubiquitous in molecular gas detectable via the co(1 - 0 ) line .",
    "unfortunately , the ch lines tend to be very weak , with peak antenna temperatures that seldom surpass 0.5 k and , more often , are in the tens of millikelvin range .",
    "this is partly a consequence of the relatively low ch abundance ( compared to co ) in interstellar clouds as determined from observations ( 4 @xmath10 10@xmath11 with respect to h@xmath3 ; e.g. , liszt & lucas ( 2002 ) and reference therein ) , and partly because of the peculiar non - thermal excitation of the 3 ghz transitions ( e.g. , rydbeck et al .",
    "1976 ; liszt & lucas 2002 ) . however , the linear relationship of n(ch ) with n(h@xmath3 ) - at least for n(h@xmath3 ) @xmath12 5 @xmath10 10@xmath13 @xmath14 ( federman 1982 ; danks , federman , & lambert 1984 ; mattila 1986 ; rachford et al .",

    "2003 ; weselak et al .",
    "2004 ) - makes ch a valid tracer of molecular gas in all but the densest cloud regions ( which tend to occupy little cloud volume - see below ) and , because the transition is optically thin in the interstellar medium , many of the difficulties inherent in interpreting co(1 - 0 ) data are avoided .",
    "the only systematic ch survey of the galactic plane was made by johansson ( 1979 ) and his results , though intriguing , are not well - known because they were published in a report of the research laboratory of electronics and onsala space observatory .",
    "basically , the galactic plane was surveyed in the ch 3335 mhz line at 2.5@xmath2 or 5@xmath2 intervals from @xmath1 10@xmath2 - 230@xmath2 .",
    "like the co emission , the ch peaks at a galactocentric distance of 5.5 kpc ( assuming r@xmath15 = 10 kpc ) and the equivalent of the molecular ring ( e.g. , scoville & sanders 1987 ; dame , hartmann , & thaddeus 2001 ; simon et al .",
    "2001 ) is clearly seen in the ch data .",
    "however , in comparison with to the co distribution , the ch data show significant excess emission between 7 - 10 kpc .",
    "given that the ch distribution in this portion of the galaxy appeared to be intermediate between the co and hi distributions , johansson ( 1979 ) speculated that a portion of the ch emission arose from a low - density molecular gas regime that was not readily traceable by co. the existence of such a regime has sometimes been proposed to explain infrared excess regions ( e.g. , reach , wall , & odegard 1998 ; blitz , bazell , & dsert 1990 ) .",
    "the question of whether the ch 3335 mhz line can trace low - density h@xmath3 not detectable in the co(1 - 0 ) transition has been explored in some detail by magnani & onello ( 1993 ; 1995 ) and revisited by magnani et al .",
    "the consensus opinion seems to be that deep co spectra will generally reveal the same lines as seen in deep ch spectra .",
    "the co surveys used by johansson ( 1979 ) may not have been sufficiently sensitive to pick up the co equivalent of the excess ch emission between 7 - 10 kpc . however , regardless of the ultimate resolution of the excess ch issue , the results of johansson ( 1979 ) merit further consideration .",
    "in addition to confirming the johansson ( 1979 ) results , ch observations of the 3335 mhz line can be used to calibrate the co - h@xmath3 conversion factor , x@xmath4 [ @xmath16 n(h@xmath3)/w@xmath4 , where w@xmath4 is the velocity - integrated co(1 - 0 ) antenna temperature ] .",
    "magnani & onello ( 1995 ) find that this method works well for translucent molecular gas but is thought to break down for dark molecular clouds and for the denser portions of gmcs .",
    "the principal reason is that in dense ( and thus opaque ) molecular regions , ch is converted into more complex molecular species so that its abundance decreases rapidly with increasing n(h@xmath3 ) , @xmath17 , or opacity ( e.g. , federman 1982 ; viala 1986 ; lee , bettens , & herbst 1996 ; liszt & lucas 2002 ) .",
    "in addition to chemistry considerations , the presence of significant background continuum radiation ( from hii regions embedded in gmcs ) can also drive down the ch antenna temperature ( rydbeck et al .",
    "1976 ) .",
    "observations compiled from several sources by mattila ( 1986 ) confirm this result ; in using n(ch ) as a molecular tracer for 6 gmc lines of sight underestimates n(h@xmath3 ) significantly ( see figure 10 of his paper ) .",
    "however , even if ch completely disappeared at high densities , gmcs are not uniformly at @xmath18 10@xmath6 @xmath7 .",
    "the molecular envelopes around dense , star - forming cores have low enough densities and constitute enough of the cloud to drive the average molecular volume density of gmcs down to 50 @xmath7 ( blitz 1991 ) .",
    "lada , bally , & stark ( 1991 ) estimate from co observations that the dense cores ( i.e. , those with @xmath19 10@xmath20 @xmath7 ) in the l1630 ( orion b ) gmc constitute only a small fraction ( not greater than 19% ) of the total cloud mass .",
    "the fraction of a gmc s mass and volume as a function of @xmath17 likely varies greatly from cloud to cloud and has not been adequately studied .",
    "nevertheless , gmc envelopes around dense cores are ideal sources for the ch 3 ghz lines and the early ch surveys confirmed this [ rydbeck et al .",
    "( 1976 ) ; hjalmarson et al . ( 1977 ) ; genzel et al . ( 1979 ) ] , although the ch lines were often weaker than those observed in dark clouds . however ,",
    "because of the decreased abundance of ch at high molecular densities , the ch 3335 mhz line will systematically underestimate n(h@xmath3 ) and , thus , x@xmath4 in gmcs .",
    "the key issue is to determine how significant is this effect .    in order to examine these issues",
    "further , we conducted a preliminary ch galactic plane survey with the nrao 140 ft telescope , observing ch emission from 4 regions along the galactic plane .",
    "three of the regions were centered at @xmath21 0@xmath2 and @xmath1 50@xmath2 , 100@xmath2 , and 110@xmath2 , and are described in this paper ; the other region covered the galactic center and , given its uniqueness and exclusion from the johansson ( 1979 ) survey , the observations are described elsewhere ( magnani et al .",
    "2005 ) . in  2 of this paper ,",
    "we describe the set - up for the ch 3335 mhz and c@xmath22o 109.8 ghz observations , and the results are presented in  3 . in  4 , we discuss the ch - h@xmath3 relation at higher n(h@xmath3 ) than usual and , in  5 , derive the values of x@xmath4 for the various components along the observed lines of sight .",
    "a brief conclusion closes the paper .",
    "the ch 3335 line was observed in 3 general directions along the galactic plane in 1999 march using the now - defunct 140 ft telescope in green bank , west virginia . at 3.3 ghz",
    "the beam size of the 140 ft was 9@xmath23 .",
    "the observing configuration consisted of a front end with a corrugated dual - hybrid mode feed in which two linear polarizations were fed into a dual - channel fet amplifier receiver .",
    "the system temperature on the sky ranged from 35 - 50 k , depending on the atmospheric conditions and the antenna elevation .",
    "the autocorrelator was configured into two sections of 512 channels , with each section covering a bandwidth of 5 mhz at a velocity resolution of 0.88 km s@xmath24 per channel .",
    "the total velocity coverage of each spectrum was @xmath25 450 km s@xmath24 centered on the v@xmath26 velocity corresponding to the bulk of the co emission as determined from the dame , hartmann , & thaddeus ( 2001 ) survey .",
    "a 5-point cross was made at each of the 3 locations with the central spectrum at @xmath21 0@xmath2 and @xmath27 50@xmath2 , 100@xmath2 , and 110@xmath2 , and the other 4 spectra offset by 0.125@xmath2 in latitude or longitude .",
    "each position was observed in on - off mode with one hour total on - source integrations .",
    "the off positions were typically 10@xmath2 away from the plane in @xmath28 . for each line of sight",

    "the three central positions ( @xmath1 50@xmath2 , 100@xmath2 , and 110@xmath2 at @xmath21 0@xmath2 ) were also observed in the c@xmath22o(1 - 0 ) line at 109.8 ghz with the cfa 1.2 meter telescope , the same instrument used for the dame et al .",
    "( 2001 ) co survey .",
    "flat spectral baselines were obtained by position switching every 15 s between the source position and two emission - free positions chosen to straddle the source in elevation .",
    "residual baseline offsets ( @xmath12 1 k ) were removed by fitting straight lines to the baseline region . at 109.8 ghz ,",
    "the 256 channel filterbank spectrometer provided a velocity resolution of 0.68 km s@xmath24 over a range of 174 km s@xmath24 .",
    "total integration times per position ranged from 1 to 3 hours , yielding rms noise levels of 12 - 16 mk per channel .",
    "the ch and co profiles shown in figures 1 - 3 are strikingly similar to each other .",
    "everywhere there is co(1 - 0 ) emission there is also ch emission .",
    "however , the integration times are very different .",
    "each ch spectrum was observed for at least one - hour on source , whereas the co spectra were only observed for a few minutes .",
    "although the ch spectra presented in this paper have significantly higher signal - to - noise ratios than the johansson ( 1979 ) results ( 5 - 8 mk vs. 20 mk ) , nevertheless , the spectra for equivalent lines of sight look quite similar ( the resolution of the data in this paper is 9@xmath23 vs. 15@xmath23 for the johansson data ) .    all the spectra centered on ( @xmath29 ) = ( 50@xmath2 , 0@xmath2 ) and the composite spectrum at ( @xmath29 ) = ( 100@xmath2 , 0@xmath2 )",

    "the column density can be obtained in the traditional manner ( see rydbeck et al .",

    "1979 ; hjalmarson et al . 1977 ; rydbeck et al .",
    "1976 ) , the quantity in square brackets is nearly always close to unity ( however , see discussion in magnani & onello 1995 and liszt & lucas 2002 ) .",
    "consequently , n(ch ) is directly proportional to w@xmath32 and is tabulated in column 5 of table 1 .",
    "once n(ch ) has been obtained , the conversion to n(h@xmath3 ) follows from the empirical relation established by mattila ( 1986 ) :    @xmath40    however , as pointed out in the  1 , this empirical relation is calibrated only for values of n(h@xmath3 ) @xmath12 5 @xmath10 10@xmath13 @xmath14 .",
    "nevertheless , the values obtained by using equation 2 are listed in column 6 of table 1 .",
    "as figures 1 - 3 make clear , the ch 3335 mhz spectral line profiles track the co(1 - 0 ) emission , and thus h@xmath3 , very well ; at all velocities where there is co(1 - 0 ) emission , there is also ch emission - albeit at a much lower antenna temperature .",
    "this is confirmed by plotting w@xmath32 vs. w@xmath4 ; the linear relation that ensues has a correlation coefficient of 0.76 .",
    "however , in order to compare our results with earlier work , we convert w@xmath32 to n(ch ) via equation 1 , and w@xmath4 to n(h@xmath3 ) using the standard galactic plane value of x@xmath4 ( 1.6 @xmath10 10@xmath41 @xmath14 k km s@xmath24 - hunter et al .",
    "the plot of log n(ch ) vs. log n(h@xmath3 ) is very similar to what was obtained by mattila ( 1986 ) and is shown in figure 4 .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the lines of sight with the greatest n(h@xmath3 ) tend to deviate from the mattila relation .",
    "thus , n(ch ) appears to systematically underestimate n(h@xmath3 ) for values @xmath42 5 @xmath10 10@xmath13 @xmath14 .",
    "however , it is important to stress that , in this regime , the n(h@xmath3 ) values derived from co observations may have large uncertainties associated with them .",
    "n(h@xmath3 ) is not directly determined , and statements of how any quantity varies with n(h@xmath3 ) in dense molecular regions must be viewed with some caution .",
    "a least squares fit to our data yields n(h@xmath3 ) = 3.60 @xmath10 10@xmath43 n(ch ) - 2.36 @xmath10 10@xmath41 , somewhat similar equation 2 .",
    "if we fit only those points in our data set with n(h@xmath3 ) @xmath12 5 @xmath10 10@xmath13 , we obtain a best fit line n(h@xmath3 ) = 2.46 @xmath10 10@xmath43 n(ch ) + 1.47 @xmath10 10@xmath41 , virtually identical to the mattila result .",
    "liszt & lucas ( 2002 ) combine translucent and dark cloud ch and co data from magnani & onello ( 1995 ) and new ch and co observations to create an n(ch ) vs. w@xmath4 plot that shows three modes of behavior : ( 1 ) a slow increase of n(ch ) with w@xmath4 is evident for both dark and translucent gas .",
    "( 2 ) a nearly fixed , factor of 3 offset in the best fit lines to the dark vs. translucent data sets , with the dark data having the larger y - intercept . ( 3 ) a scatter in n(ch ) at any given value of w@xmath4 ascribed by liszt and lucas to variations in the ch excitation and the local physical conditions .",
    "the second point is somewhat problematic because the data for mbm16 from magnani & onello ( 1995 ) are classified by liszt & lucas ( 2002 ) as belonging to the dark cloud category .",
    "mbm16 is a translucent cloud according to the standard definition of translucent : 1 @xmath44 a@xmath45 5 magnitudes ( van dishoeck & black 1988 ) .",
    "direct measurements of the cloud extinction by the method of star counts conducted by magnani & de vries ( 1986 ) indicate that the average extinction of the cloud is only 0.9 magnitudes ( a@xmath46 ) above the background with even the most obscured regions barely above 2 magnitudes .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible that the ch excitation conditions in mbm16 differ enough from those in  normal \" translucent gas that the ch and co properties of this object may be more similar to those found in dark molecular gas . assuming that the bimodal distribution attributed to the data by liszt & lucas ( 2002 )",
    "does indeed exist , and is not merely a large scatter in the ch and co properties of the clouds , liszt and lucas speculate that the shallowness of the slope in the diffuse gas reflects the trend that at low extinction n(co ) @xmath47 [ n(ch)]@xmath9 @xmath47 [ n(h@xmath3)]@xmath9 . in the dark gas ,",
    "the same shallow slope ( albeit with a y - intercept a factor of 3 higher ) likely reflects the decline of the ch abundance in denser gas at higher values of w@xmath4 .    in figure 5",
    ", following liszt & lucas ( 2002 ) , we present a plot of n(ch ) vs. w@xmath4 for our data ( star symbols ) . also included in the plot",
    "are the data liszt & lucas classify as arising from dark and translucent gas ( plotted as diamond symbols and plus signs , respectively ) .",
    "as is clear from the figure , the galactic plane data fall on and extend the relationship for the dark clouds noted by liszt & lucas ( 2002 ) .",
    "thus , the galactic plane molecular clouds observed in this paper are as likely underabundant in ch as the dark cloud population selected by liszt & lucas ( 2002 ) .",
    "magnani & onello ( 1995 ) describe in detail how to derive x@xmath4 using ch 3335 mhz and co 115 ghz data .",
    "in essence , equations 1 and 2 are used to obtain n(h@xmath3 ) from the ch data , and this result is divided by w@xmath4 at similar resolution to immediately yield x@xmath4 .",
    "this was done for all 21 components in our sample and the results are tabulated in table 2 and shown graphically in figure 6 .",
    "the lines of sight centered on and around ( @xmath48 ( 50@xmath2 , 0@xmath2 ) typically show 3 separate components : a relatively weak feature at @xmath25 6 km s@xmath24 that likely arises from very local , small , molecular clouds , and stronger emission from inner galaxy gmcs at v@xmath49 45 and 57 km s@xmath24 .",
    "this interpretation is confirmed by figure 7a which shows the c@xmath22o(1 - 0 ) spectrum for ( @xmath48 ( 50@xmath2 , 0@xmath2 ) .",
    "this transition traces dense molecular gas typically found in the cores of gmcs or dark clouds ( @xmath18 10@xmath20 @xmath7 ) , and is detected for this line of sight only at v@xmath49 45 and 57 km s@xmath24 .",
    "the average x@xmath4 for the 6 km s@xmath24 gas is 1.9 @xmath10 10@xmath41 , while the inner galaxy x@xmath4 values are somewhat lower ; 1.2 @xmath10 10@xmath41 and 1.3 @xmath10 10@xmath41 for the 45 and 57 km s@xmath24 features , respectively .",
    "these relatively low values of x@xmath4 may be the result of the ch method underestimating the true value of n(h@xmath3 ) in gmcs , as discussed above .",
    "however , if the correct value of x@xmath4 in these inner galaxy regions is obtained from the standard 1.6 @xmath10 10@xmath41 value used by hunter et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the ch method underestimates n(h@xmath3 ) and , consequently , x@xmath4 , by no more than a factor of 2 .",
    "the lines of sight centered on and around ( @xmath48 ( 100@xmath2 , 0@xmath2 ) have only one component at v@xmath49 -50 km s@xmath24 that arises from molecular clouds in the perseus spiral arm .",
    "the c@xmath22o spectrum from the central position shows relatively strong emission at v@xmath49 -50 km s@xmath24 ( see figure 7b ) indicating that the molecular gas along this line of sight has a dense component .",

    "again , these determinations most likely underestimate the real values .",
    "however , as in the case of inner galaxy gmcs , the underestimate is not severe ; no more than a factor of 2 - 3 .    the 5-point cross centered on @xmath21 0@xmath2 and @xmath1 100@xmath2 has a much lower w@xmath4 than the other two regions , and the ch 3335 mhz line is also so weak that the 5 lines of sight have to be averaged in order to identify the two components ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "in contrast to the preceeding two regions , the corresponding values of x@xmath4 derived from the ch data are larger than the standard values by factors of 3 and 9 , seemingly implying that the ch method may be overestimating n(h@xmath3 ) for these lines of sight . however , it is more likely given the weakness of the co and ch lines in the direction ( @xmath48 ( 100@xmath2 , 0@xmath2 ) that this emission is not tracing molecular gas in gmcs or dark cloud complexes but , rather , molecular gas in lower density , lower opacity objects such as translucent clouds .",
    "in support of this conclusion , the c@xmath22o spectrum for the central position shows no signal to an rms of 16 mk . in these types of clouds",
    ", x@xmath4 can vary by more than an order of magnitude from cloud to cloud and even over a single cloud , and can take on values both substantially higher and lower than the standard value ( magnani & onello 1995 ; magnani et al .",
    "1998 ) .    for those lines of sight with w@xmath4 values greater than 10 k km",
    "s@xmath24 , indicative of the presence of gmcs or other high column and volume density clouds , the x@xmath4 values derived from the ch method are systematically lower than the conventional value for the galactic plane by factors of 2 - 3 .",
    "for those lines of sight with w@xmath4 more similar to what is expected from somewhat lower column density molecular clouds - like dark clouds , @xmath50 tends to be close to the conventional value .",
    "finally , for the lines of sight where the two components have w@xmath4 values lower than those of dark clouds , more similar to what is seen in translucent molecular gas , the x@xmath4 values are larger than normal ; typical of what is obtained when using the ch method on translucent clouds ( magnani & onello 1995 ) .",
    "the ch 3335 mhz observations described in this paper confirm that this transition is a good tracer of molecular gas at low densities .",
    "figures 1 - 3 underscore how strikingly similar ch 3335 mhz profiles can be to co(1 - 0 ) profiles at similar resolution .",
    "although the weakness of the line in most galactic environments probably precludes its use in large - scale surveys , the result from the undersampled galactic plane survey made by johansson ( 1979 ) - that there is more molecular gas between the molecular ring and the solar circle than has been traced by the co surveys - should probably be revisited .",
    "if this gas exists , it can undoubtedly also be traced by the co(1 - 0 ) line , but integration times longer than what has commonly been employed by the large - scale surveys are probably needed .    as first noted by magnani & onello ( 1995 ) , for lower density",
    "molecular gas typical of that found in small , local molecular clouds , x@xmath4 as determined from the ch method is consistent with other determinations - though variations from cloud to cloud can be significant . for gmcs ,",
    "the data presented here show that n(h@xmath3 ) and , consequently , x@xmath4 is systematically underestimated by the ch method .",
    "this is what would be expected from the chemistry of the molecule as described in  1 .",
    "surprisingly , the underestimate is not more than a factor of 2 - 3 compared to what is obtained from other methods .",
    "given astrochemistry models of dense molecular gas environments , this result implies that most of the volume of gmcs is not at high molecular densities ( @xmath51 10@xmath6 @xmath7 ) and the lower density envelopes contribute significantly to the overall molecular mass ( see also , lada , bally , & stark 1991 ; blitz , 1991 ; magnani , hartmann , & speck 1996 ) .",
    "the results described above are limited , covering 21 velocity components distributed over 15 lines of sight along 3 principal directions in the galactic plane .",
    "unfortunately , the capacity to obtain more data is even more limited .",
    "currently , in the western hemisphere , the only radio telescope equipped to make ch 3 ghz observations is at arecibo .",
    "the nature of the arecibo dish is such that only a limited portion of the galactic glane can be surveyed ( the galactic center is unaccessible with that telescope ) . given the promising results from our preliminary survey project , we hope that in the not too distant future the 100 meter nrao telescope at green bank will be outfitted with an upper s - band receiver so that a proper survey might be conducted .",

    "<S> spectra in the ch @xmath0 , j=1/2 , f=1 - 1 transition at 3335 mhz were obtained in three 5-point crosses centered on the galactic plane at @xmath1 50@xmath2 , 100@xmath2 , and 110@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the lines of sight traverse both giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) and local , smaller entities . </S>",
    "<S> this transition is a good tracer of low - density molecular gas and the line profiles are very similar to co(1 - 0 ) data at nearly the same resolution . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , the ch 3335 mhz line can be used to calibrate the co - h@xmath3 conversion factor ( x@xmath4 ) in low - density molecular gas . </S>",
    "<S> although this technique underestimates x@xmath4 in gmcs , our results are within a factor of two of x@xmath4 values calibrated for gmcs by other techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the similarity of ch and co line profiles , and that of x@xmath4 values derived from ch and more traditional techniques , implies that most of the molecular gas along the observed lines of sight is at relatively low densities ( @xmath5 10@xmath6 @xmath7 ) . </S>"
