    "the nature of the ground state in the underdoped regime of the hole - doped cuprate superconductors remains a central open issue .",
    "angle resolved photoemision spectroscopy ( arpes ) and scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) have been the main tools to explore such a regime . in both probes ,",
    "an unexpected angular dependence of the electron spectral gap function has been revealed : a ` dichotomy ' between the nodal and anti - nodal regions of the brillouin zone in the superconducting state @xcite .",
    "specifically , this dichotomy is realized by deviations in the angular dependence of the gap from that of a short - range @xmath1-wave pairing amplitude @xmath2 .",
    "this paper will describe the superconducting instabilities of a recently developed model @xcite of the normal state of the underdoped cuprates based upon a theory of fluctuating local antiferromagnetic order @xcite . a related normal state model of fluctuating",
    "antiferromagnets has been discussed by khodas and tsvelik @xcite , who obtained results on the influence of spin - wave fluctuations about the ordered state similar to ours @xcite .",
    "these results have been found to agree well with arpes observations @xcite .",
    "another approach using fluctuating antiferromagnetism to model the underdoped cuprates has been discussed recently by sedrakyan and chubukov @xcite .",
    "we will also connect with the scenario emerging from recent dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) studies @xcite .",
    "the theory of ref .   describes the normal state in the underdoped regime as a fractionalized fermi liquid ( ffl or fl * ) , although this identification was not explicitly made in that paper .",
    "so we begin our discussion by describing the the structure of the fl * phase .",
    "the fl * phase is most naturally constructed @xcite using a kondo lattice model describing a band of conduction electrons coupled to lattice of localized spins arising from a half - filled @xmath1 ( or @xmath3 ) band .",
    "the key characteristics of the fl * are ( _ i _ ) a ` small ' fermi surface whose volume is determined by the density of conduction electrons alone , and ( _ ii _ ) the presence of gauge and fractionalized neutral spinon excitations of a spin liquid . in the simplest picture ,",
    "the fl * can be viewed in terms of two nearly decoupled components , a small fermi surface of conduction electrons and a spin liquid of the half - filled @xmath1 band .",
    "the fl * should be contrasted from the conventional fermi liquid , in which there is a ` large ' fermi surface whose volume counts both the conduction and @xmath1 electrons : such a heavy fermi liquid phase has been observed in many ` heavy fermion ' rare - earth intermetallics .",
    "recent experiments on ybrh@xmath4(si@xmath5ge@xmath6)@xmath4 have presented evidence @xcite for an unconventional phase , which could possibly be a fl*.    a concept related to the fl * is that of a `` orbital - selective mott transition '' @xcite ( osmt ) , as discussed in the review by vojta @xcite . for latter",
    ", we begin with a multi - band model , like the lattice anderson model of conduction and @xmath1 electrons , and have a mott transition to an insulating state on only a subset of the bands ( such as the @xmath1 band in the anderson model ) .",
    "the osmt has been described so far using dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) , which has an over - simplified treatment of the mott insulator . in finite dimensions ,",
    "any such mott insulator must not break lattice symmetries which increase the size of a unit cell , for otherwise the state reached by the osmt is indistinguishable from a conventionally ordered state .",
    "thus the mott insulator must be realized as a fractionalized spin liquid with collective gauge excitations ; such gauge excitations are not present in the dmft treatment . with a mott insulating spin liquid",
    ", the phase reached by the osmt becomes a fl*.    returning our discussion to the cuprates , there is strong arpes evidence for only a single band of electrons , with a conventional luttinger volume of @xmath7 holes at optimal doping and higher ( here @xmath0 is the density of holes doped into the half - filled insulator ) .",
    "consequently , the idea of an osmt does not seem directly applicable .",
    "however , ferrero _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite argued that an osmt could occur in momentum space within the context of a single - band model .",
    "they separated the brillouin zone into the ` nodal ' and ` anti - nodal ' regions , and represented the physics using a 2-site dmft solution .",
    "then in the underdoped region , the anti - nodal region underwent a mott transition into an insulator , while the nodal regions remained metallic .",
    "a similar transition was seen by sordi _",
    "et al . _ in studies with a 4-site cluster@xcite .",
    "while these works offers useful hints on the structure of the intermediate energy physics , ultimately the dmft method does not allow full characterization of the different low energy quasiparticles or the nature of any collective gauge excitations .",
    "we turn then to the work of ref .  , who considered a single band model of a fluctuating antiferromagnet .",
    "their results amount to a demonstration that a fl * state can be constructed also in a single band model , and this fl * state will form the basis of the analysis of the present paper .",
    "the basic idea is that the large fermi surface is broken apart into pockets by local antiferromagnetic nel order .",
    "we allow quantum fluctuations in the orientations of the nel order so that there is no global , long - range nel order .",
    "however , spacetime ` hedgehog ' defects in the nel order are suppressed , so that a spin liquid with bosonic spinons and a u(1 ) gauge - boson excitation is realized @xcite . alternatively , the nel order could develop spiral spin correlations , and suppressing @xmath8 vortices in the spiral order realizes a @xmath8 spin liquid with bosonic spinons@xcite .",
    "the fermi pockets also fractionalize in this process , and we are left with fermi pockets of spinless fermions ; the resulting phase was called the algebraic charge liquid @xcite ( acl ) .",
    "depending upon the nature of the gauge excitations of the spin liquid , the acl can have different varieties : the u(1)-acl and su(2)-acl were described in refs .",
    "@xcite , and @xmath8-acl descends from these by a higgs transition involving a scalar with u(1 ) charge 2 , as in the insulator @xcite .",
    "although these acls are potentially stable phases of matter , they are generically susceptible to transformation into fl * phases . as was already noted in ref .  , there is a strong tendency for the spinless fermions to found bound states with the bosonic spinons , leading to pocket fermi surfaces of quasiparticles of spin @xmath9 and charge @xmath10 .",
    "also , as we will review below , there is a ` species - doubling ' of these bound states @xcite , and this is crucial in issues related to the luttinger theorem , and to our description of the superconducting state in the present paper .",
    "when the binding of spinless fermions to spinons is carried to completion , so that fermi surfaces of spinless fermions has been completely depleted , we are left with fermi pockets of electron / hole - like quasiparticles which enclose a total volume of precisely @xmath0 holes @xcite .",
    "the resulting phase then has all the key characteristics of the fl * noted above , and so we identify it here as a fl*. the u(1)-acl and @xmath8-acl above lead to the conducting u(1)-fl * and @xmath8-fl * states respectively . ref .   presented a phenomenological hamiltonian to describe the band structure of these fl * phases .",
    "thus this is an explicit route to the appearance of an osmt in a single - band , doped antiferromagnet : it is the local antiferromagnetic order which differentiates regions of the brillouin zone , and then drives a mott transition into a spin liquid state , leaving behind fermi pockets of holes / electrons with a total volume of @xmath0 holes .",
    "we should note here that the u(1)-fl * state with a u(1 ) spin liquid is ultimately unstable to the appearance of valence bond solid ( vbs ) order at long scales @xcite .",
    "however the @xmath8-fl * is expected to describe a stable quantum ground state .",
    "the analysis of the fermion spectrum below remains the same for the two cases .",
    "phases closely related to the u(1)-fl * and @xmath8-fl * appeared already in the work of ref .  .",
    "this paper examined ` quantum disordered ' phases of the shraiman - siggia model @xcite , and found states with small fermi pockets , but no long - range antiferromagnetic order .",
    "the antiferromagnetic correlations where either collinear or spiral , corresponding to the u(1 ) and @xmath8 cases .",
    "however , the topological order in the sector with neutral spinful excitations was not recognized in this work : these spin excitations were described in terms of a o(3 ) vector , rather than su(2 ) spinor description we shall use here .",
    "indeed , the topological order is required in such phases , and is closely linked to the deviation from the traditional volume of the fermi surfaces .",
    "@xcite    we also note another approach to the description of a fl * state in a single band model , in the work of ribeiro , wen , and ran @xcite .",
    "they obtain a small fermi surface of electron - like `` dopons '' moving in spin - liquid background .",
    "however , unlike our approach with gapped bosonic spinons ( and associated connections with magnetically ordered phases ) , their spinons are fermionic and have gapless dirac excitation spectra centered at @xmath11 .",
    "we will take the u(1)-fl * or @xmath8-fl * state with bosonic spinon spin liquid as our model for the underdoped cuprates in the present paper .",
    "we will investigate its pairing properties using a simple phenomenological model of @xmath1-wave pairing .",
    "our strategy will be to use the simplest possible model with nearest - neighbor pairing with a @xmath1-wave structure , constrained by the requirement that the full square lattice translational symmetry and spin - rotation symmetry be preserved . even within this simple context",
    ", we will find that our mean - field theories of the fl * state allows us to easily obtain the ` dichotomy ' in the pairing amplitude over a very broad range of parameters .",
    "we also note that the pocket fermi surfaces of the fl * state will exhibit quantum oscillations in an applied magnetic field with a zeeman splitting of free spins , and this may be relevant to recent observations @xcite .",
    "we mention here our previous work @xcite on pairing in the parent acl phase . these papers considered pairing of spinless fermions , while the spin sector was fully gapped : this therefore led to an exotic superconductor in which the bogoliubov quasiparticles did not carry spin .",
    "in contrast , our analysis here will be on the pairing instability of the fl * state , where we assume that the fermions have already bound into electron - like quasiparticles , as discussed above and in more detail in ref .  .",
    "the resulting bogoliubov quasiparticles then have the conventional quantum numbers .    .",
    "here we simply apply a potential which oscillates at @xmath12 to the large fermi surface in the overdoped region .",

    "we also show a comparison to a conventional state with co - existing spin density wave ( sdw ) and @xmath1-wave pairing , and to recent experiments .",
    "the left panels illustrate fermi surface structures in the normal state .",
    "the right panels show the angular dependence of the electron gap in the superconducting states : for each angle @xmath15 , we determine the minimum electron spectral gap along that direction in the brillouin zone , and plot the result as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "the results of the traditional hartree - fock / bcs theory on sdw order and @xmath1-wave pairing appear in ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the sdw order has wavevector @xmath16 , and the @xmath1-wave pairing is the conventional @xmath17 form . in the normal state ,",
    "the fermi pocket is centered at the magnetic brillouin zone boundary , as shown in ( a ) .",
    "an important feature of this simple theory is that the state with co - existing sdw and @xmath1-wave pairing has its maximum gap at an intermediate angle , as shown in ( b ) : this reflects the `` hot spots '' which are points on the fermi surface linked by the sdw ordering wavevector @xmath18 .",
    "no experiment has yet seen such a maximum at an intermediate angle .",
    "one set of our typical results for the fl * theory are shown in ( c ) and ( d ) . as it was shown in the previous work @xcite , the normal state in ( c ) shows a fermi pocket which is clearly",
    "not centered the magnetic zone boundary ( at @xmath11 ) ; furthermore , its spectral weight is not the same along the fermi surface , and has a arc - like character . at the same time , ( d ) shows the angular dependence of the electron gap in the superconducting state ; unlike the sdw theory , this fl * state has a pairing amplitude which is a monotonic function of angle and has its maximum at the antinodal point .",
    "it also shows the `` dichotomy '' in the gap amplitude between the nodal and anti - nodal regions . for the purpose of comparison ,",
    "we illustrate two experimental results in ( e ) and ( f ) .",
    "clearly , our mean - field theory can provide reasonable explanation for the experimental data in both the normal and superconducting states , and we believe it is a candidate for the under - doped cuprate materials .",
    "the structure of this paper is following . in section  [ effective hamiltonian ]",
    ", we introduce the normal state hamiltonian for the fermions , and investigate the symmetry transformations of possible pairings .",
    "we classify possible pairings which preserve full square lattice symmetry , and introduce a low energy effective pairing hamiltonian . in section  [ spectral gaps ] , spectral gap functions for various cases are illustrated assuming @xmath19 wave pairing .",
    "it is shown that our model can reproduce the dichotomy behavior , and we compare our theory with the yrz model proposed by yang , rice and zhang @xcite , and the related analyses by wen and lee @xcite . for completeness , it is shown that @xmath20 gauge fluctuation can mediate the needed @xmath1 wave pairing in appendix  [ pairing instability ] .",
    "the basic setup of the fl * state has been reviewed in some detail in refs .  , and",
    "so we will be very brief here .",

    "then we examined the formation of bound states between these excitations .",
    "a key result was that was a `` doubling '' of electron - like quasiparticles , with the availability of two gauge neutral combinations , @xmath31 this doubling is a reflection of the ` topological order ' in the underlying u(1 ) or @xmath8 spin liquid ; it would not be present _",
    "e.g. _ in a su(2 ) spin liquid @xcite .",
    "the @xmath32 and the @xmath33 will be the key actors in our theory of the fl * phase here . their effective hamiltonian is strongly constrained by their non - trivial transformations under the space group of the hamiltonian , which are listed in table  [ table1 ] .",

    "the only invariant coupling up to the second order derivatives is @xcite @xmath46 it is interesting to note that this coupling is precisely the geometric phase coupling between the antiferromagnetic and valence bond solid ( vbs ) order parameters discussed recently in ref .  .",

    "we can also look for a coupling between the magnetic field , @xmath47 , and the fermions .",
    "there is no coupling up to the second order derivatives of fermionic fields .",
    "the main reason for the absence is that rotation and inversion transformations have opposite signs acting on the magnetic field .",
    "if we go beyond the second order derivative , we can find a coupling to the magnetic field such as @xmath48 this term is also one associated with the geometric phase between the antiferromagnetic and vbs orders , corresponds to the temporal term in eq .",
