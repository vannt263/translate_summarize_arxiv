    "magnetic fields localized in stellar radiation zones can play an important role in many essential phenomena like mixing , angular momentum transport and formation of the solar tachocline , for instance .",
    "it is rather uncertain which field can be present in the radiation zone .",
    "observations provide upper limits on the allowed strength of the magnetic field in the radiation zone of the sun .",
    "for instance , helioseismological measurements suggest an upper limit @xmath0 g as an order of magnitude estimate ( see , e.g. , friedland & gruzinov 2004 ) .",
    "the recently measured oblateness of the sun ( codier & rozelot 2000 ) implies that the strength of the magnetic field is lower than @xmath1 g. the observations of the splitting of solar oscillation frequencies provide the upper limit of @xmath2 g for a toroidal field near the base of the convective zone ( antia et al .",
    "2000 ) . for other stars estimates",
    "are less certain and only theoretical upper limits can be derived .",
    "the possible origin of the field ( if it exists ) is also unclear .",
    "likely , a hydromagnetic dynamo can not operate in the radiation zone , where no strong flows are available to sustain a vigorous dynamo action .",
    "perhaps , relic magnetic fields acquired by the star at the early stage of evolution can persist there .",
    "these type of fields could have formed , for instance because of differential rotation , which could have stretched a weak diffuse primordial seed field ( see , e.g. , dicke 1979 ) into a dominant toroidal field . due to a high conductivity ,",
    "the ohmic decay is very slow and the decay time can exceed several billion years . therefore ,",
    "once formed , the large - scale relic field would survive in the radiation zone during the life - time of a star .    the magnetic field ,",
    "however , can evolve in a radiation zone not only due to ohmic dissipation but also because of the development of various instabilities .",
    "for instance , in differentially rotating radiation zones , the magnetorotational instability can occur .",
    "most likely , however , the magnetized radiative zones rotate rigidly and the stability of magnetic configurations is determined by various current - driven instabilities .",
    "such instabilities are well studied in cylindrical geometry in the context of laboratory fusion research ( see , e.g. , freidberg 1973 , goedboed 1971 , goedbloed & hagebeuk 1972 ) . for example , the stability properties of a pure toroidal field @xmath3 are determined by the parameter @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the cylindrical radius .",
    "the field is unstable to axisymmetric perturbations if @xmath6 and to non - axisymmetric perturbations if @xmath7 ( tayler 1973a , b , 1980 ) .",
    "note , however , that the addition of a even relatively weak poloidal field alters substantially the stability properties of the magnetic configuration .",
    "for example , if the poloidal field is uniform and relatively weak , the instability condition reads @xmath8 at variance with the condition of instability for a purely toroidal field ( see , e.g. , knobloch 1992 ; dubrulle & knobloch 1993 ) which predicts that an unstable toroidal field configuration has @xmath9 . in astrophysical conditions ,",
    "the instability caused by electric currents might have various characteristic properties ( see bonanno & urpin 2008a , b ) . in the presence of both azimuthal and axial fields , non - axisymmetric disturbances with large azimuthal wavenumbers @xmath10 turn out to be most rapidly growing .",
    "unstable disturbances exhibit a resonant character , i.e. the wave vector @xmath11 approximately satisfies the condition of magnetic resonance , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the wavevector in the axial direction and @xmath14 is the magnetic field .",
    "the length scale of this instability depends on the ratio of poloidal and azimuthal field components and it can be very short , while the width of the resonance turns out to be very narrow .",
    "for this reason , its excitation in direct numerical simulations can be problematic .",
    "stability of the spherical magnetic configurations is studied in much less detail and even the overall stability properties of radiation zones are rather unclear .",
    "braithwaite & nordlund ( 2006 ) have studied the stability of a random initial field in the stellar radiative zone by means of direct numerical simulations and found that the stable magnetic configurations generally have the form of tori with comparable poloidal and toroidal field strengths .",
    "numerical modeling by braithwaite ( 2006 ) confirmed that the toroidal field with @xmath15 or @xmath16 is unstable to the @xmath17 mode as it was predicted by tayler ( 1973 ) .",
    "however , even a purely toroidal field can be stable in the region where it decreases rapidly with @xmath5 .",
    "note that a purely toroidal field can not be stable throughout the whole star because the stability condition for axisymmetric modes ( @xmath18 ) is incompatible with the condition that the electric current in the @xmath19-direction has no singularity at @xmath20 which implies @xmath21 .",
    "the stability of the toroidal field in rotating stars has been considered by kitchatinov ( 2008 ) and kitchatinov & rdiger ( 2008 ) who argued that the magnetic instability is essentially three - dimensional and determined the threshold field strength at which the instability sets . estimating this threshold in the solar radiation zone , the authors impose the upper limit on the magnetic field @xmath22 g.    in this paper , we consider the stability of the toroidal field in radiation zones by taking into account stratification and thermal conductivity .",
    "it turns out that magnetic configurations can be stable or unstable depending on the radial profile of the toroidal field .",
    "we argue that stable stratification can substantially decrease the growth rate of the instability but can not suppress it entirely .",
    "consider the stability of an axisymmetric toroidal magnetic field in the radiation zone using a high conductivity limit .",
    "we work in spherical coordinates ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) with the unit vectors ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) .",
    "we assume that the toroidal field depends on @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath29 . in the incompressible limit ,",
    "the mhd equations read @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 is gravity . in the basic state ,",
    "the gas is assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium , then @xmath34 we assume that the magnetic energy is subthermal and therefore @xmath33 is approximately radial .",
    "the equation of thermal balance reads in the boussinesq approximation @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the thermal diffusivity and @xmath37 is the adiabatic temperature gradient .",
    "we consider a linear stability .",
    "small perturbations will be indicated by subscript 1 , while unperturbed quantities will have no subscript . linearizing eqs.(1)-(3 ) and",
    "( 5 ) , we take into account that small perturbations of the density and temperature in the boussinesq approximation are related by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the thermal expansion coefficient . for small perturbations ,",
    "we use a local approximation in the @xmath24-direction and assume that their dependence on @xmath24 is proportional to @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the longitudinal wavenumber . since the basic state is stationary and axisymmetric , the dependence of perturbations on @xmath42 and @xmath25 can be taken in the exponential form as well .",
    "then , perturbations are proportional to @xmath43 where @xmath10 is the azimuthal wavenumber . the corresponding wavevectors are @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively . the dependence on @xmath23",
    "should be determined from eqs.(1)-(3 ) , ( 5 ) . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we assume that unperturbed @xmath46 and @xmath47 are approximately homogeneous in the radiation zone .",
    "this assumption does not change the main conclusions qualitatively but substantially simplifies calculations .",
    "we also neglect the effect of rotation . as we know from the work of pitts and tayler ( 1986 ) , rotation itself can not remove instabilities of the interchange type , although it can affect the shape the unstable modes . for this reasons",
    "we argue that the conclusions of our investigation can not be altered by the inclusion of rotation .    eliminating all variables in favor of @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    ", we obtain the following set of two coupled equations @xmath50 v_{1r } = - k_{\\perp}^2 \\beta g \\sigma \\frac{t_1}{t } , \\\\   \\frac{\\kappa}{r^2 } \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r } \\left [ r^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r } \\left ( \\frac{t_1}{t } \\right ) \\right ] - ( \\sigma + \\kappa k_{\\perp}^2 ) \\frac{t_1}{t } = \\frac{\\omega_{bv}^2}{\\beta g } v_{1r},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath23 and @xmath51    some general stability properties can be derived directly from eqs.(6)-(7 ) .",
    "consider perturbations with a very short radial wavelength for which one can use a local approximation in the radial direction , such as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the radial wavevector .",
    "if @xmath54 , then eqs.(6)-(7 ) can be reduced with the accuracy in terms of the lowest order in @xmath55 to the following set @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "the corresponding dispersion relation reads @xmath58 the conditions that at least one of the roots has a positive real part ( unstable mode ) is determined by the routh criterion ( see , e.g. , aleksandrov , kolmogorov , & laurentiev 1985 ) . for a particular case of a cubic equation , these conditions can be easily obtained , for example , from expressions derived by urpin & rdiger ( 2005 ) . since the quantities @xmath36 and @xmath59 are positively defined , the only non - trivial condition of instability is @xmath60 that is not satisfied in the radiation zone by definition .",
    "therefore , modes a with short radial wavelength are always stable to the current - driven instability contrary to the conclusion obtained by kichatinov ( 2008 ) and kichatinov & rdiger ( 2008 ) .",
    "we assume that the radiation zone is located at @xmath61 .",
    "the toroidal field can be represented as @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the characteristic field strength ; @xmath65 is a function of the radius alone .",
    "the dependence of @xmath66 on @xmath67 is uncertain in in the radiation zone and , in this work , we consider only the case where @xmath66 increases with @xmath67 .",
    "other possibilities will be considered in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we parametrize @xmath68 with the following dependence @xmath69 where @xmath70 characterizes the width of a field distribution and @xmath71 and @xmath72 are chosen so that @xmath73 and @xmath74 as shown in fig.1 ; @xmath75 .",
    "we choose @xmath76 to be equal to @xmath77 from computational reasons .",
    "we have verified that our results are basically insensitive to the precise value of @xmath76 as long as it is close to the center .",
    "the situation where the field reaches its maximum at the outer boundary can model , for example , the radiative interior of a star with a convective envelope . in this case",
    ", the bottom of the convection zone is the location of the toroidal field generated by a dynamo action which can penetrate into the radiation zone .",
    "this situation can also mimic the toroidal field in the liquid core of neutron stars .",
    "likely , the magnetic field of these objects is generated by turbulent dynamo during the very early phase of the evolution when the neutron star is subject to hydrodynamical instabilities ( see , e.g. , bonanno et al .",
    "dynamo induced by turbulent motions generates the magnetic field of complex topology including small scale fields ( urpin & gil 2004 ) .",
    "large - scale dynamo is most efficient in the surface layers where the density gradient is maximal .",
    "therefore , the generated field increases outward and reaches its maximum in the outer layers ( bonanno et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "this magnetic field can be subject to current - driven instabilities after the end of the unstable phase .    introducing the dimensionless quantities @xmath78 where @xmath79",
    ", we can transform eqs.(6)-(7 ) into a dimensionless form .",
    "these equations with the corresponding boundary conditions describe the stability problem as a non - linear eigenvalue problem .",
    "fortunately , the main qualitative features of this problem are not sensitive to the choice of boundary conditions .",
    "that is why we choose the simplest conditions and assume that @xmath80 at @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "note that the parameter @xmath83 is large in radiation zones but , most likely , @xmath84 is relatively small if the magnetic field is not very weak . in calculations ,",
    "we suppose @xmath83 and @xmath84 to be constant through the radiation zone .    to illustrate the stabilizing effect of stratification on the instability , we plot in fig.2 the growth rate as a function of the stratification parameter @xmath83 for several eigenmodes with a different number of nodes in the radial direction .",
    "in these calculations , we neglect the thermal conductivity , therefore , the stabilizing effect of gravity is most pronounced .",
    "the growth rate is always maximal for the fundamental eigenmode ( @xmath85 ) but rapidly decreases with an increasing number of nodes @xmath86 .",
    "note that such a rapid decrease of @xmath87 with the number of an eigenmode is typical also for the case of neutral stratification @xmath88 ( or no gravity @xmath89 ) .",
    "the conclusion that @xmath87 decreases rapidly with @xmath86 confirms our result obtained from eqs.(6)-(7 ) in a short wavelength approximation ( see section 2 ) that modes with a short radial lengthscale ( large @xmath86 ) should be stable .",
    "this conclusion is at variance with the statement by kitchatinov & rdiger ( 2008 ) that the most rapidly growing modes correspond to @xmath90 .",
    "according to our calculations , the fundamental mode turns out to be most rapidly growing . however , even the instability of this mode is entirely suppressed if @xmath91 .",
    "the effect of a thermal conductivity can change the properties of a current - driven instability qualitatively . in fig.3",
    ", we plot the dependence of the growth rate on the parameter stratification @xmath92 for three different values of the thermal conductivity , corresponding to @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 .",
    "the behaviour of all curves is qualitatively similar : the growth rate is @xmath96 at small @xmath83 decreases as @xmath97 for @xmath98 or , in dimensional form , @xmath99 this dependence can be obtained also directly from the basic equations .",
    "the stabilizing effect of gravity in a linear theory is determined by the first term on the right hand side of eq.(1 ) .",
    "linearization of this term yields @xmath100 since @xmath101 in the boussinesq approximation .",
    "perturbations of the temperature are determined by thermal balance eq.(7 ) .",
    "near the threshold of the instability when @xmath102 is small , we have @xmath103 . therefore , the stabilizing contribution of gravity in eq.(1 ) is of the order of @xmath104 . on the other hand , the destabilizing effect of electric currents in eq.(1 )",
    "is given by the lorentz force .",
    "the order of magnitude estimate of the lorentz force yields @xmath105 .",
    "since the toroidal field is inhomogeneous in the basic state , perturbations of the toroidal field are produced basically by perturbations of the radial velocity and @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the radial lengthscale of the magnetic field . using this expression",
    ", we obtain that the lorentz force is of the order of @xmath108 where @xmath109 . equating the stabilizing contribution of gravity to the destabilizing contribution of the electric current",
    ", we obtain @xmath110 if @xmath84 is fixed , this expression yields the dependence @xmath111 that follows from numerical calculations .",
    "the relation ( 14 ) implies that even a very strong stable stratification can not entirely suppress the instability .",
    "the growth rate turns out to be non - vanishing even for large @xmath83 at variance with the case where thermal conductivity is neglected ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "we have considered the effects of stratification and thermal conductivity on the stability of a toroidal field in stellar radiation zones .",
    "the magnetic configuration with a predominantly toroidal field can be formed , for example , due to differential rotation during the early stage of stellar evolution if the star has got even a weak seed field .",
    "it turns out that stable stratification can suppress the current induced instability of the toroidal field if perturbations are not influenced by the thermal conductivity ( very small @xmath84 ) .",
    "the instability does not arise if the brunt - visl frequency is greater than @xmath112 . since @xmath113 is typically high in radiative zones ( @xmath114 s@xmath115 ) the instability sets in only if the field is very strong ( @xmath116 g ) .",
    "higher eigenmodes are suppressed stronger than the fundamental one and perturbations with short radial wavelength are always stable .",
    "the thermal conductivity drastically changes the character of the instability .",
    "this concerns particularly the behavior near the threshold of instability where the growth rate is small .",
    "it turns out that the growth rate is non - vanishing for any stratification .",
    "even very strong gravity can not suppress the instability entirely but it only decreases the growth rate .",
    "this sort of behavior is typical for perturbations with any wavevector @xmath117 and can be easily understood",
    ". a destabilizing effect of electric currents in the momentum equation ( 1 ) originates from the last term on the r.h.s . and is proportional to a perturbation of the magnetic field , @xmath118 .",
    "a perturbation @xmath118 is related to @xmath119 by @xmath120 as it follows from the linearized induction equation .",
    "a stabilizing influence of gravity in the linearized momentum equation is proportional to a perturbation of the temperature , @xmath49 .",
    "if the growth rate is small , then we can obtain from thermal balance equation ( 5 ) that @xmath121 . comparing the destabilizing and stabilizing effects",
    ", we see that stable stratification can never suppress the instability at variance with the @xmath122 case .",
    "a decrease of @xmath102 caused by stratification is inversely proportional to the brunt - visl frequency .",
    "if gravity is strong but the magnetic field is weak , the instability develops very slowly . generally ,",
    "for a sufficiently weak magnetic field , the growth rate can be comparable to the inverse life - time of a star .",
    "it should be noted also that , most likely , the field does not decay to zero because of this instability . when the field becomes weaker , the growth rate of the instability decreases and the field can not decay to values smaller than those resulting from a growth rate of the order of the inverse life - time of a star .",
    "therefore , a weak field can generally be only slowly changed during the life of the star , although its radial profile can be unstable .",
