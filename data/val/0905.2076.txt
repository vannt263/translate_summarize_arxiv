    "the dynamical excitation density is thus concentrated at the surface and , in the hard - wall homogeneous density approximation , given by @xmath134 , just like in the case of the surface plasmon .",

    "assuming that the polarization @xmath130 is uniform inside the particle , and equal to the mean spin polarization @xmath143 ( for the example of na@xmath144 @xcite one has @xmath145 ) , we obtain a response to the spin - independent excitation @xmath146 in the magnetization channel @xmath93 which is proportional to the induced @xmath131 in the charge channel , with proportionality constant @xmath147 .",

    "we observed a one - to - one correspondence of the particle - hole excitations and the spin - dipole modes .",
    "we thus showed that the spin - dipole modes are slight perturbations of the particle - hole excitations , and therefore do not qualify as genuine collective excitations , contrary to the claim of ref .  .",
    "finally , we studied the possibility of exciting the spin - dipole modes by ordinary optical means ( laser pulses ) . for open - shell systems , it is well - known that the spin and charge modes are coupled in the linear regime @xcite .",

    "the ratio between the strengths of the absorption peak for the spin dipole and charge dipole modes was shown to be given by the spin polarization of the ground - state .",
    "while our numerical calculations were done in the case of na nanoparticles , our general conclusions are also valid for noble - metal nanoparticles and semiconductor quantum dots .",
    "the latter systems are more adapted than alkaline nanoparticles for experimental spectroscopic studies . moreover , the concepts developed for the study of spin modes in normal - metal nanoparticles could be useful in analyzing ferromagnetic nanoparticles , in view of the strong internal field existing in these materials .    we thank m.  barranco for helpful correspondence and we acknowledge financial support from the french national research agency anr ( project anr-06-blan-0059 ) .",
