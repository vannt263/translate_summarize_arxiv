    "alternatively , the fit can be improved by adding an absorption edge which is thought to originate from warm gas along the line of sight . with the resulting best fit from a physical warm absorber model ( next section ) already in mind , the major absorption edges being those of ovii , oviii and nex , we modeled the x - ray spectrum with 3 single edges ( of the form @xmath35 for @xmath36 ) superimposed on a powerlaw .",

    "for the present observation of ngc 4051 the addition of an emission and reflection component to the x - ray spectrum , calculated with the code _ cloudy _ for a covering factor of the warm material of 0.5 , only negligibly changes the results ( @xmath0 = 22.70 ) due to the weakness of these components .",

    "it contributes about the same amount to the ionizing luminosity as the powerlaw continuum used for the modeling and has the properties of the euv spectral component for which evidence is presented in sect .",
    "the observational data were compared to four further model sequences , which consisted of ( i ) a change in metal abundances of the warm gas up to 0.2 @xmath60 solar , ( ii ) the addition of dust with galactic ( ism ) properties to the gas , or a modification of the sed impinging on the absorber , by ( iii ) the addition of an euv black body component with a temperature of @xmath65 = 100000 k or 150000 k contributing the same amount to the ionizing luminosity as the powerlaw component ( the choice of these parameters is motivated and further discussed in sects .",

    "an additional ir component strongly increases the free - free heating of the gas and the electron temperature rises .",
    "an additional black body component in the euv with the properties given above has negligible influence on the x - ray absorption structure .",

    "the intrinsic , i.e. unabsorbed , powerlaw with index @xmath13 = 2.3 is steeper than the seyfert-1 typical one with 1.9 . in fact , fixing the slope of the intrinsic powerlaw to @xmath13 = 1.9 ( with @xmath10 and @xmath11 as free parameters ) leads to a significantly worse fit ( @xmath66 = 5.2 ) .",
    "this still holds when all data points below 0.3 kev ( which show some residual structure interpretable as a very soft excess , as mentioned above ) are excluded from the spectral fitting ( @xmath66 = 4.3 ) .",
    "since a soft excess on top of a flat powerlaw might mimick a single steeper powerlaw , we have performed some further tests to check , whether the data can be reconciled with @xmath13 = 1.9 plus a soft excess , parameterized as a black body .",

    "the black body contribution is always found to be negligible ( with a normalization of less than 10@xmath67 ph/@xmath18/s ) . when the other fit parameters , namely the ionization parameter of the warm absorber , are changed to enforce a black body contribution to the fit",
    ", @xmath68 remains far above acceptable values .",
    "secondly , @xmath65 was left as an additional free parameter . in this case , a very soft excess is found , with @xmath69 35 ev , ill - constrained by the data , and the overall quality of the fit is not yet acceptable . systematically steepening the underlying powerlaw ,",

    "( we note that only in this section do we use this ` tight ' definition of ` soft ' band . throughout the rest of the paper",
    ", the term ` soft excess ' more losely refers to a component somewhere in the energy band without implying it to be located exclusively below 0.5 kev . )",
    "the soft band is dominated by the cold - absorbed powerlaw component , whereas the dominant feature of the warm absorber , the oxygen absorption edge , is located in the hard band .",
    "we find essentially correlated variability between both components ( fig .",

    "we have performed warm - absorber fits to individual subsets of the total observation ( referred to as ` orbits ' hereafter ) . the warm column density , @xmath11 , is not expected to vary on short timescales and was fixed to the value determined for the total observation .",
    "the same was done for the unabsorbed powerlaw index @xmath2 = 2.3 ( but see comment below ) .",

    "if the warm material reacted instantaneously to variations in the ionizing luminosity , a clear correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath71 would be expected .",

    "this method makes use of the fact that the [ oii]/[oiii ] ratio is rather insensitive to the spectral shape of the ionizing continuum ( although it tends to overestimate the number of photons , if the emission line region in question contains density inhomogeneities or a large fraction of matter - bounded clouds ; schulz &  komossa   1993 ) . the oxygen ratio , as measured by malkan ( 1986 ) yields an ionization parameter for the nlr of @xmath97 - 2.5 . to determine @xmath46 , the mean density and distance of the narrow line region have to be known .",

    "for relatively high ionization parameters , dust very effectively competes with the gas in the absorption of photons ( e.g. laor & draine 1993 ) .",
    "an interesting point to pursue in this context is the following : an old puzzle is the lack of any transition region between blr and nlr ( judged from missing ` intermediate ' line emission ) .",
    "netzer & laor ( 1993 ) proposed this to be due to the relatively more important influence of dust in an intermediate zone .",
    "can the warm absorber be identified with this transition region ?",
    "firstly , re - running a large number of models , we find no successful fit of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "this can be traced back to the relatively higher importance of edges from more lowly ionized species , significantly changing the x - ray absorption spectrum and particularly a very strong carbon edge .",
    "secondly , independent evidence for non - dusty warm gas comes from the observed uv and euv spectrum , if these components travel along the same path as the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the 2175   bump in the uv spectrum of ngc 4051 is not particularly strong ( e.g. walter et al .",

    "however , again , such models do not fit the observed x - ray spectrum , even if silicate only is assumed to avoid a strong carbon feature and its abundance is depleted by 1/10 . )",
    "indubitably , the dust in ngc 4051 could be significantly different from the galactic one .",
    "however , too many additional free parameters are introduced in this case to warrant a more detailed study .",
    "we conclude that the soft x - ray spectrum of ngc 4051 is not dominated by a ( galactic - ism - like)_dusty _ warm absorber .",
    "we emphasize , however , that dusty warm absorbers might explain the low - energy absorption edges seen in some active galaxies ( work in progress , for first results see komossa & fink 1996 ) .",
    "the absence of dust in the warm material would imply either ( i ) the _ history _ of the warm gas is such that dust was never able to form , like e.g. in an inner - disc driven outflow ( e.g. knigl & kartje 1994 , murray et al .",
    "1995 , witt et al . subm . ) or ( ii ) if dust originally existed in the absorber , the _ conditions in _ the gas have to be such that dust destruction is guaranteed . in the latter case",
    ", one obtains an important constraint on the density ( location ) of the warm gas , which then has to be high enough ( near enough ) to ensure the dust is destroyed . for the present case ( and galactic - ism - like dust ) only a narrow range in density around @xmath112 @xmath51 is allowed . for lower densities , dust can survive in at least part of the absorber and higher densities have already been excluded in sect .",
    "constraints on the covering factor of the warm gas result from ( i ) its emissivity in emission lines , which has to be low enough not to predict line emission stronger than the observed one , and ( ii ) the desire to account for the rather large number of seyferts which show evidence for warm absorption ( e.g. fabian 1996 ) , leading to the expectation of a correspondingly large _ mean _ covering .    in particular , it is interesting to ask whether one of the emission line regions present in ngc 4051 ( and in seyfert galaxies in general ) , like the coronal line region , or the one responsible for the broad component seen in h@xmath4 in ngc 4051 , can be identified with the warm absorber .    in the case of ngc 4051 ,",
    "the maximal warm - absorber intrinsic h@xmath4 emission predicted for the best - fit model is only about 1/220 of the observed @xmath94 . rescaling",
    "the strongest predicted optical emission line , [ fexiv]@xmath55303 , correspondingly leads to an intensity ratio [ fexiv]@xmath113/h@xmath114 0.01 .",

    "( 1985 ) and it is consistent with a covering of the warm material of less or equal 100% .    due to the low emissivity of the warm gas ,",
    "no strong uv - euv emission lines are produced ( e.g. heii@xmath51640@xmath113/h@xmath116 , neviii@xmath5774@xmath113/h@xmath117 , fexvi@xmath5343@xmath113/h@xmath118 ) .",
    "consequently , no known emission line component in ngc 4051 can be fully identified with the warm absorber .",
    "this conclusion still holds when the properties of the warm material are changed compared to the ` standard ' assumptions ( but note , that only one parameter is varied at a time ) : the strength of e.g. [ fexiv ] is also dependent on the density and changes by a factor of several depending on the value of @xmath49 , but stays below the observed upper limit",
    ". for subsolar metal abundances of the absorber heii@xmath51640 becomes the strongest line in the uv - optical region due to the increased helium column necessary to ensure the same column in metal ions and thereby the same strength of the absorption edges in x - rays . for metal abundances of 0.2 @xmath60 solar ,",
    "we find heii@xmath51640@xmath113/h@xmath119 .",
    "a strong additional ir spectral component incident on the warm gas slightly influences the line emission , although again , there is no strong contribution to the optical - uv spectrum .",
    "the ionization structure of the best - fit warm absorber model indicates that the expected uv absorption by e.g. c@xmath120 or n@xmath121 is low .",

    "hst spectra would allow to search for these absorption lines and thereby further constrain the properties of the warm material .        in the preceding discussion ,",
    "photoionization equilibrium was assumed . that photoionization indeed plays an important role for the ionization of warm material",
    "is shown by a direct reaction of the absorber ( i.e. the depth of the oviii absorption edge ) in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 to changes in the continuum ( otani et al .",
    "the equilibrium state of the gas depends on its reaction timescale compared to the timescale of changes in the continuum flux ( see krolik & kriss 1995 ) . in case",
    "the continuum variations are slow compared to the recombination timescale , the warm material re - adjusts to each continuum level , whereas a mean continuum is appropriate for modeling in the opposite case .",
    "the latter seems to apply to the present observation , with no reaction of the warm gas despite changes in the luminosity .",
    "however , in the long term there are changes in the ionization parameter of the gas : an earlier observation shows both , lower mean luminosity and ionization parameter ( mchardy et al .",
    "1995 ; treating and re - fitting these data with the same data reduction procedures and model assumptions as carried out for the present observation yields @xmath1 = 0.2 , @xmath0 = 22.45 , @xmath13 = 2.2 and an integrated ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) luminosity of @xmath135 erg / s ) .",
    "although this might mean that the warm material follows long term trends in the luminosity but not the very short - time variability , the situation seems to be more complex .",

    "1996 ) find @xmath10 to be variable within one day .",

    "\\(ii ) a scenario in which the warm gas does not see luminosity changes is one in which the variability is not intrinsic to the central continuum source but caused between the absorber and the observer .",

    "( 1988 ) proposed the existence of fast moving , dense blobs of matter within the inner region of active galaxies , partially blocking the line of sight to the continuum source .",
    "a similar scenario was invoked by kunieda et al .",

    "the present observation is consistent with the blob model , if the source were in state ` c ' ( in the terminology of kunieda et al . , referring to variable soft and constant hard observed flux ) .",
