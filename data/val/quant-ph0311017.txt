    "one of the main theoretical challenges in quantum computation theory is quantum algorithm design .",
    "some attempts to uncover underlying principles common to all known efficient quantum algorithms have already been explored though not definite and satisfactory answer has been found yet . on the one hand",
    ", it has been seen that majorization theory seems to play an important role in the efficiency of quantum algorithms @xcite .",
    "all known efficient quantum algorithms verify a step by step majorization of the probability distribution associated to the quantum register in the measurement basis .",
    "therefore , efficient quantum algorithms drive the system towards the final solution by carefully reordering probability amplitudes in such a way that a majorization arrow is always present . on the other hand ,",
    "the most relevant ingredient is likely the role entanglement plays in quantum computational speedup . regarding this topic several results have recently been found @xcite which suggest that entanglement is at the heart of the power of quantum computers .",
    "an important result has been obtained by vidal @xcite , who proved that large entanglement of the quantum register is a necessary condition for exponential speed - up in quantum computation . to be concrete , a quantum register such that the maximum schmidt number of any bipartition is bounded at most by a polynomial in the size of the system",
    "can be simulated efficiently by classical means .",
    "the figure of merit @xmath0 proposed in @xcite is the maximum schmidt number of any bi - partitioning of the quantum state or , in other words , the maximum rank of the reduced density matrices for any possible splitting .",
    "it can be proved that @xmath1 , where the von neumann entropy @xmath2 refers to the reduced density matrix of any of the two partitions . if @xmath3 at every step of the computation in a quantum algorithm , then it can be efficiently classically simulated . exponential speed - up over classical computation",
    "is only possible if at some step along the computation @xmath4 , or @xmath5 , being @xmath6 and @xmath7 positive constants . in order to exponentially accelerate the performance of classical computers any quantum algorithm",
    "must necessarily create an exponentially large amount of @xmath0 at some point .",
    "another topic of intense research concerns the behavior of entanglement in systems undergoing a quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "quantum correlations in critical systems have been analyzed in many situations and using a wide range of entanglement measurements @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been noted @xcite that some of these measurements have important connections to well - known results arising from conformal field theory @xcite . more generally , when a splitting of a @xmath8-dimensional spin system is made , the von neumann entropy for the reduced density matrix of one of the subsystems @xmath9 at the critical point should display a universal leading scaling behavior determined by the _ area _ of the region partitioning the whole system .",
    "this result depends on the connectivity of the hamiltonian and applies as is to theories with a gaussian continuum limit .",
    "for example , when separating the system in the interior and the exterior of a sphere of radius @xmath10 and assuming an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath11 , the entropy of @xmath12 the interior is    @xmath13    where @xmath14 corresponds to a known heat - kernel coefficient @xcite . in terms of the number of spins present in the system , this leading universal scaling behavior can be written as    @xmath15    ( which reduces to a logarithmic law for @xmath16 ) .",
    "this explicit dependence of entanglement with dimensionality throws new light into some well established results from quantum computation .",
    "a similar situation is present in quantum adiabatic algorithms , initially introduced by farhi et .",
    "@xcite , where the hamiltonian of the system depends on a control parameter @xmath17 which in turn has a given time dependence .",
    "the hamiltonians related to adiabatic quantum computation for solving some np - complete problems ( such as 3-sat or exact cover ) can be directly mapped to interactive non - local spin systems , and therefore we can extend the study of entanglement to include this kind of hamiltonians .",

    "in this paper we analyze the scaling of the entropy of entanglement in several quantum algorithms .",
    "more concretely , we focus on shor s quantum factoring algorithm @xcite and on a quantum algorithm by adiabatic evolution solving the np - complete problem exact cover @xcite , finding for both of them evidence of a quantum exponential speedup with linear scaling of quantum correlations , which difficults the possibility of an efficient classical simulation .",

    "4 we focus on the adiabatic implementation of grover s quantum searching algorithm , and derive analytical expressions for the study of entanglement in the system . finally , in sec .",
    "5 we collect the conclusions of our work .",
    "it is believed that the reason why shor s quantum algorithm for factorization @xcite beats so clearly its classical rivals is rooted in the clever use it makes of quantum entanglement .",
    "several attempts have been made in order to understand the behavior of the quantum correlations present along the computation @xcite . in our case",
    ", we will concentrate in the study of the scaling behavior for the entanglement entropy of the system .",
    "we shall first remember both shor s original @xcite and phase - estimation @xcite proposals of the factoring algorithm and afterwards we shall move to the analytical analysis of their quantum correlations .",
    "the interested reader is addressed to @xcite for precise details . given an odd integer @xmath18 to factorize , we pick up a random number @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "we make the assumption that @xmath6 and @xmath18 are co - primes ( otherwise the greatest common divisor of @xmath6 and @xmath18 would already be a non - trivial factor of @xmath18 ) .",
    "there exists a smaller integer @xmath20 $ ] , called the _ order _ of the modular exponentiation @xmath21 , such that @xmath22 . let us assume that the @xmath6 we have chosen is such that @xmath23 is even and @xmath24 , which happens with very high probability ( bigger than or equal to @xmath25 ) .",
    "this is the case of interest because then the greatest common divisor of @xmath18 and @xmath26 is a non - trivial factor of @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , the factoring problem has been reduced to the order - finding problem of the modular exponentiation function @xmath27 , and it is at this point where quantum mechanics comes at work .",
    "the procedure can be casted in two different ways :      we make use of two quantum registers : a source register of @xmath28 qubits ( such that @xmath29 $ ] ) and a target register of @xmath30 qubits .",
    "the performance of the quantum algorithm is shown in fig .",

    "the information provided by a final measurement of the quantum computer enables us to get the factors of @xmath18 in a time @xmath42 .",

    "[ shor ] ) or the controlled @xmath36 operation ( fig .",
    "[ shor2 ] ) , and before the quantum fourier transform in both cases . at this step of the computation",
    ", the pure quantum state of the quantum computer is easily seen to be exactly the same for both quantum circuits , and is given by    @xmath44    tracing out the quantum bits corresponding to the source , we get the density matrix of the target register , which reads    @xmath45    that is ,    @xmath46    the last step comes from the fact that @xmath22 , being @xmath47 $ ] the order of the modular exponentiation . if @xmath48 were a multiple of @xmath23 there would not be any approximation and the last equation would be exact .",
    "this is not necessarily the case , but the corrections to this expression go like @xmath49 , thus being exponentially small in the size of the system .",
    "it follows from expression ( [ rho ] ) that the rank of the reduced density matrix of the target register at this point of the computation is    @xmath50    because @xmath47 $ ] , this rank is usually @xmath51 .",
    "if this were not the case , for example if @xmath23 were @xmath52 , then the order - finding problem could be efficiently solved by a classical naive algorithm and it would not be considered as classically hard . because @xmath18 is exponentially big in the number of qubits , we have found a particular bipartition of the system ( namely , the bipartition between the source register and the target register ) and a step in the quantum algorithm in which the entanglement , as measured by the rank of the reduced density matrix of one of the subsystems , is exponentially big .",
    "this implies in turn that shor s quantum factoring algorithm can not be efficiently classically simulated by any protocol in ref.@xcite owing to the fact that at this step @xmath53 , therefore constituting an inherent exponential quantum speed - up based on an exponentially big amount of entanglement .",
    "it is worth noticing that the purpose of the entanglement between the two registers consists on leaving the source in the right periodic state to be processed by the quantum fourier transform .",
    "measuring the register right after the entangling gate disentangles the two registers while leaving the source in a periodic state , and this effect can only be accomplished by previously entangling source and target .",
    "these conclusions apply both to shor s original proposal ( circuit of fig .",
    "[ shor ] ) and to the phase - estimation version ( circuit of fig .",
    "[ shor2 ] ) .",
    "the behavior of the rank of the system involves that the entropy of entanglement of the reduced density matrix at this point will mainly scale linearly with the number of qubits , @xmath54 , which is the hardest of all the possible scaling laws .",
    "we will find again this strong behavior for the entropy in sec .",
    "we now turn to analyze how entanglement scales for a quantum algorithm based on adiabatic evolution @xcite , designed to solve the np - complete problem exact cover @xcite .",
    "we first briefly review the proposal and , then , we consider the study of the properties of the system , in particular the behavior of the entanglement entropy for a given bipartition of the ground state .      the adiabatic model of quantum computation deals with the problem of finding the ground state of a given system represented by its hamiltonian .",
    "many relevant computational problems ( such as 3-sat ) can be mapped to this situation .",
    "the method is briefly summarized as follows : we start from a time dependent hamiltonian of the form    @xmath55    where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the initial and problem hamiltonian respectively , and @xmath58 is a time - dependent function satisfying the boundary conditions @xmath59 and @xmath60 for a given @xmath61 .",
    "the desired solution to a certain problem is codified in the ground state of @xmath57 .",
    "the gap between the ground and the first excited state of the instantaneous hamiltonian at time @xmath62 will be called @xmath63 .",
    "let us define @xmath64 as the global minimum of @xmath63 for @xmath62 in the interval @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "if at time @xmath61 the ground state is given by the state @xmath66 , the adiabatic theorem states that if we prepare the system in its ground state at @xmath67 ( which is assumed to be easy to prepare ) and let it evolve under this hamiltonian , then    @xmath68    provided that    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is the hamiltonian matrix element between the ground and first excited state , @xmath71 , and the maximization is taken over the whole time interval @xmath72 $ ] . because the problem hamiltonian codifies the solution to the problem in its ground state , we get the desired solution with high probability after a time @xmath61 .",
    "a closer look to the adiabatic theorem tells us that @xmath61 dramatically depends on the scaling of the inverse of @xmath73 with the size of the system . more concretely ,",
    "if the gap is only polynomially small in the number of qubits ( that is to say , it scales as @xmath74 , the computational time is @xmath75 , whereas if the gap is exponentially small ( @xmath76 ) the algorithm makes use of an exponentially big time to reach the solution .",
    "the explicit functional dependence of the parameter @xmath58 on time can be very diverse .",
    "the point of view we adopt in the present paper is such that this time dependence is not taken into account , as we study the properties of the system as a function of @xmath17 , which will be understood as the hamiltonian parameter .",
    "we will in particular analyze the entanglement properties of the ground state of @xmath77 , as adiabatic quantum computation assumes that the quantum state remains always close to the instantaneous ground state of the hamiltonian all along the computation .",
    "note that we are dealing with a system which is suitable to undergo a quantum phase transition at some critical value of the hamiltonian parameter , and therefore we expect to achieve the biggest quantum correlations at this point .",
    "the question is how this big quantum correlations scale with the size of the system when dealing with interesting problems .",
    "this is the starting point for the next two sections .",
    "the np - complete problem exact cover is a particular case of the 3-sat problem , and is defined as follows : given the @xmath78 boolean variables @xmath79 , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is regarded as the bit index , we define a _ clause _ of exact cover involving the three qubits @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath28 ( say , clause",
    " @xmath83 \" ) by the equation @xmath84 .",
    "there are only three assignments of the set of variables @xmath85 that satisfy this equation , namely , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88",
    ". the clause can be more specifically expressed in terms of a boolean function in conjunctive normal form ( cnf ) as @xmath89 so @xmath90 as long as the clause is properly satisfied .",
    "an _ instance _ of exact cover is a collection of clauses which involves different groups of three qubits .",
    "the problem is to find a string of bits @xmath91 which satisfies all the clauses .",
    "this problem can be mapped into finding the ground state of a hamiltonian @xmath57 in the following way : given a clause @xmath83 define the hamiltonian associated to this clause as    @xmath92    where we have defined @xmath93 , @xmath94 ) .",
    "the quantum states of the computational basis that are eigenstates of @xmath95 with zero eigenvalue ( ground states ) are the ones that correspond to the bit string which satisfies @xmath83 , whereas the rest of the computational states are penalized with an energy equal to one .",
    "now , we construct the problem hamiltonian as the sum of all the hamiltonians corresponding to all the clauses in our particular instance , that is to say ,    @xmath96    so the ground state of this hamiltonian corresponds to the quantum state whose bit string satisfies _ all _ the clauses . we have reduced the original problem stated in terms of boolean logic to the hard task of finding the ground state of a two and three body interactive spin hamiltonian with local magnetic fields .",
    "observe that the couplings depend on the particular instance we are dealing with , and that the spin system has not an a priori well defined dimensionality neither a well defined lattice topology , in contrast with some usual simple spin models .",
    "we now define our s - dependent hamiltonian @xmath77 as a linear interpolation between an initial hamiltonian @xmath56 and @xmath57 :    @xmath97    where we take the initial hamiltonian @xmath56 to be basically a magnetic field in the @xmath98 direction , more concretely ,    @xmath99    where @xmath100 is the number of clauses in which qubit @xmath81 appears , and @xmath101 , with @xmath102 ,",
    "so the ground state of @xmath56 is an equal superposition of all the possible computational states .",
    "observe that @xmath77 is , apart from a constant factor , a sum of terms involving local magnetic fields in the @xmath98 and @xmath103 direction , together with two and three - body interaction coupling terms in the @xmath103 component .",
    "this system is suitable to undergo a quantum phase transition ( in the limit of infinite @xmath78 ) as @xmath17 is shifted from @xmath104 to @xmath105 .",
    "the study of this phenomena is the aim of the following section .",
    "we have randomly generated instances for exact cover with only one possible satisfying assignment and have constructed the corresponding problem hamiltonians .",
    "instances are produced by adding clauses at random until there is exactly one satisfying assignment , starting over if we end up with no satisfying assignments . according to @xcite ,",
    "these are believed to be the most difficult instances for the adiabatic algorithm .",
    "our analysis proceeds as follows :    * _ appearance of a quantum phase transition _ *    we have generated 300 exact cover instances ( 300 random hamiltonians with a non - degenerated ground state ) and have calculated the ground state for 10 , 12 and 14 qubits for different values of the parameter @xmath17 in steps of @xmath106 . we then consider a particular bipartition of the system into two blocks of @xmath107 qubits , namely , the first @xmath107 qubits versus the rest , and have calculated the entanglement entropy between the two blocks . for each of",
    "the randomly generated hamiltonians we observe a peak in the entanglement entropy around a critical value of the parameter @xmath108 .",
    "we have averaged the obtained curves over the 300 instances and have obtained the plot from fig .",
    "[ mix-300 ] .",
    "the point at which the entropy of entanglement reaches its maximum value is identified as the one corresponding to the critical point of a quantum phase transition in the system ( in the limit of infinite size ) .",
    "this interpretation is reinforced by the observation of the typical energy eigenvalues of the system . for a typical instance of 10 qubits",
    "we observe that the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state reaches a minimum precisely for a value of the parameter @xmath108 ( see fig .",
    "[ gap-10 ] ) .",
    "we observe from fig .",
    "[ mix-300 ] that the peak in the entropy is highly asymmetric with respect to the parameter @xmath17 .",
    "a detailed study of the way this peak seems to diverge near the critical region seems to indicate that the growth of entanglement is slower at the beginning of the evolution and fits remarkably well a curve of the type @xmath109 , whereas the falling down of the peak is better parameterized by a power law @xmath110 a certain critical exponent .",
    "these laws governing the critical region fit better and better the data as the number of qubits is increased .    * _ analysis of different bi - partitions of the system _ *    explicit numerical analysis for @xmath111 qubits tells us that all possible bi - partitions for each one of the instances produce entropies at the critical point of the same order of magnitude -as expected from the non - locality of the interactions- .",
    "this is represented in fig .",
    "[ part1 ] , where we plot the minimum and maximum entanglement obtained from all the possible partitions of the system for each one of the generated instances ( points are sorted such that the minimum entropy monotonically increases ) .",
    "similar conclusions derive from the data plotted in fig .",
    "[ part2 ] , where we have considered again the same quantities but looking at @xmath112 partitions of the ground state for @xmath111 different instances of @xmath113 qubits . according to these results",
    "we restrict ourselves in what follows to the analysis of a particular bipartition of the system , namely the first @xmath107 qubits versus the rest .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the existence of a single partition with exponentially large entanglement makes the algorithm not amenable to classical simulation .",
    "the above result is stronger and shows that essentially all partitions are highly entangled .",
    "the system is definitely hard to simulate by classical means .    * _ scaling laws for the minimum energy gap and the entanglement entropy _ *    to characterize the finite - size behavior of the quantum phase transition ,",
    "we have generated 300 random instances of exact cover with only one satisfying assignment from 6 to 20 qubits , and studied the maximum von neumann entropy for a bipartition of the system as well as the minimum gap , both in the worst case and in the mean case over all the randomly generated instances .",
    "we must point out that the scaling laws found in this section are limited to the small systems we can handle with in our computers . increasing the number of qubits may lead to corrections in the numerical results , which should be of particular importance for a more precise time - complexity analysis of the adiabatic algorithm .",
    "[ gap ] represents the behavior of the gap in the worst and mean cases . from fig .",
    "[ gap2 ] it is noticed that the gap seems to obey a scaling law of the style @xmath114 , being @xmath78 the number of qubits , which would assure a polynomial - time quantum computation . this law is in agreement with the results in @xcite , and are in concordance with the idea that the energy gap typically vanishes as the inverse of the volume in condensed matter systems ( here the volume is the number of qubits ) .",
    "error bars in the two plots give @xmath115 per cent of confidence level in the numerically calculated mean .",
    "we have considered as well the scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy for an equally sized bipartition of the system also in the worst and in the mean case .",
    "the obtained data from our simulations are plotted in fig .",
    "[ ent ] -where error bars give @xmath115 per cent of confidence level in the mean- and seem to be in agreement with a strongly linear scaling of entanglement as a function of the size of the number of qubits .",
    "more concretely , a numerical linear fit for the mean entanglement entropy gives us the law @xmath116 .",
    "observe that the entropy of entanglement does not get saturated in its maximum allowed value ( which would be @xmath117 for @xmath78 qubits ) , so we can say that only a twenty percent of all the possible potential available entanglement appears in the quantum algorithm .",
    "linearity in the scaling law would imply that this quantum computation by adiabatic evolution , after a suitable discretization of the continuous time dependence , could not be classically simulated by the protocol of ref .",
    "given that the scaling of the gap seems to indicate that the quantum computation runs in a polynomial time in the size of the system , our conclusion is that apparently we are in front of an exponentially fast quantum computation that seems extremely difficult ( if not impossible ) to be efficiently simulated by classical means .",
    "this could be an inherent quantum mechanical exponential speedup that can be understood in terms of the linear scaling of the entropy of entanglement .",
    "note also the parallelism with the behavior of the entanglement found in shor s algorithm in sec .",
    "2 . as a remark",
    ", our numerical analysis shows that the quantum algorithm is difficult to be simulated classically in an efficient way , which does not necessarily imply that the quantum computer runs exponentially faster than the classical one , as our time - complexity analysis is limited to 20 qubits .",
    "the linear behavior for the entropy with respect to the size of the system could in principle be expected according to the following qualitative reasoning . naively , the entropy was expected to scale as the area of the boundary of the splitting , according to some considerations taken from conformal field theory ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this area - law is in some sense natural : because the entropy value is the same for both density matrices arising from the two subsystems , it can only be a function of their shared properties , and these are geometrically encoded in the area of the common boundary . for a system of @xmath78 qubits , this implies a scaling law for the entropy like @xmath118 ( which reduces to a logarithm for @xmath16 ) . our system does not have a well defined dimensionality , but owing to the fact that there are many random two and three body interactions",
    ", the effective ( fractal ) dimensionality of the system should be very large .",
    "therefore , we expect a linear ( or almost linear ) scaling , which is what we have numerically obtained . the data seems to indicate that such an effective dimensionality is around @xmath119 , thus diverging as @xmath78 goes to infinity .",
    "it is possible to compare our apparently linear scaling of the mean entropy of entanglement with the known results obtained by averaging this quantity over the entire manifold of @xmath78-qubit pure states , with respect to the natural fubini - study measure . according to the results conjectured by page @xcite and later proved in @xcite ,",
    "the average entropy for an equally - sized bipartition of a random @xmath78-qubit pure state in the large @xmath78 limit can be approximated by @xmath120 ( in our notation ) , therefore displaying as well a linear scaling law ( but different from ours ) .",
    "in fact , this is an indicator that most of the @xmath78-qubit pure states are highly entangled , and that adiabatic quantum computation naturally brings the system close to these highly entangled regions of the pure state manifold ( more information about the average entanglement of an @xmath78-qubit system can be found in @xcite ) .    * _ the entanglement - gap plane _ *    the plots in fig .",
    "[ entgap1 ] and fig .",
    "[ entgap2 ] show the behavior of the peak in the entanglement versus the gap , both again in the average and the worst case for all the generated instances .",
    "clearly , as the gap becomes smaller the production of entanglement in the algorithm increases .",
    "a compression of the energy levels correlates with high quantum correlations in the system .    *",
    "_ convergence of the critical points _ *    the critical point @xmath121 seems to be bounded by the values of @xmath17 associated to the minimum gap and to the maximum entropy .",
    "actually , the critical point corresponding to the minimum size of the energy gap is systematically slightly bigger than the critical point corresponding to the peak in the entropy . by increasing the size of the system these two points",
    "converge towards the same value , which would correspond to the true critical point of a system of infinite size .",
    "this effect is neatly observed in fig .",
    "[ move ] , which displays the values of @xmath17 associated to the mean critical points both for the gap and for the entropy as a function of @xmath78 .",
    "* _ universality _ *    all the above results suggest that the system comes close to a quantum phase transition .",
    "the characterization we have presented based on the study of averages over instances reconstructs its universal behavior .",
    "results do not depend on particular microscopic details of the hamiltonian , such as the interactions shared by the spins or the strength of local magnetic fields .",
    "any adiabatic algorithm solving a @xmath28-sat problem and built in the same way we have done for exact cover should display on average exactly the same properties we have found _ regardless of the value of @xmath28 _ , which follows from universality ( the case @xmath122 , though not being np - complete , should display also this property as its hamiltonian would consist as well of local interactions in a big - dimensional lattice ; @xmath123 is a particular case , as its hamiltonian is non - interacting ) .",
    "linear scaling of entanglement should therefore be a universal law for these kind of quantum algorithms .",
    "the specific coefficients of the scaling law for the entropy should be a function only of the connectivity of the system , that is on the type of clauses defining the instances .",
    "we have explicitly checked this assertion by numerical simulations for clauses of exact cover but involving @xmath124 qubits ( @xmath125 ) , which is a particular case of @xmath124-sat . in fig .",
    "[ univ1 ] we plot the behavior of the entropy of entanglement for a @xmath111-qubit system for these type of clauses and compare it to the same quantity calculated previously for the clauses involving @xmath126 qubits ( the usual exact cover hamiltonian ) .",
    "we observe again the appearance of a peak in the entropy , which means that the system is evolving close to a quantum phase transition .",
    "figures [ univ3 ] and [ univ2 ] respectively show the scaling of the energy gap in the mean and worst case and the scaling of the peak in the entropy in the mean and worst case as well , up to @xmath113 qubits .",
    "error bars give again @xmath115 per cent of confidence level for the means .",
    "the behavior is similar to the one already found for the instances of exact cover involving @xmath126 qubits ( figures [ gap2 ] and [ ent ] ) , which supports the idea of the universality of the results .",
    "the minimum energy gap seems to scale in this case as @xmath127 ( @xmath78 being the number of qubits ) , which would guarantee again a polynomial - time quantum adiabatic evolution .",
    "let us now consider the adiabatic implementation of grover s quantum searching algorithm in terms of a hamiltonian evolution @xcite and study its properties as a function of the number of qubits and the parameter @xmath17 .",
    "for this problem , it is possible to compute all the results analytically , so we shall get a closed expression for the scaling of entanglement . as a side remark , it is worth noting that the treatment made in @xcite is not valid for oracular problems as it is assumed that all quantum gates are known in advanced . independently of this issue",

    "our aim is to compute the amount of entanglement present in the register and need not deal with the explicit dependence of the parameter @xmath17 on time and its consequences ( see @xcite for further information about this topic ) .",
    "it is straightforward to check that the hamiltonian ( [ grahm ] ) has its minimum gap between the ground and first excited states at @xmath131 , which goes to zero exponentially fast as the number of qubits in the system is increased .",
    "therefore , this hamiltonian apparently seems to undergo a quantum phase transition in the limit of infinite size at @xmath132 .",
    "quantum correlations approach their maximum for this value of @xmath17 ( for more on grover s problem as a quantum phase transition , see @xcite ) .",
    "it can be seen ( see for example @xcite ) that the ground state energy of the hamiltonian given in equation ( [ grahm ] ) corresponds to the expression    @xmath133    being @xmath17 is the hamiltonian parameter .",
    "the corresponding normalized ground state eigenvector is given by    @xmath134    where we have defined the quantities    @xmath135    in all the forthcoming analysis we will assume that the marked state corresponds to @xmath136 , which will not alter our results .",
    "the corresponding density matrix for the ground state of the whole system of @xmath78 qubits is then given by    @xmath137    where we have defined @xmath138 as the the unnormalized sum of all the computational quantum states ( including the marked one ) , @xmath139 .",
    "taking the partial trace over half of the qubits , regardless of what @xmath107 qubits we choose , we find the reduced density matrix    @xmath140    where we understand that @xmath141 is the remaining marked state for the subsystem of @xmath107 qubits and @xmath142 is the remaining unnormalized equally superposition of all the possible computational states for the subsystem . defining the quantities    @xmath143    ( note that @xmath144 )",
    ", the density operator for the reduced system of @xmath107 qubits can be expressed in matrix notation as    @xmath145    where its dimensions are @xmath146 .",
    "we clearly see that the density matrix has rank equal to @xmath147 . therefore , because @xmath148 ( where @xmath2 is the von neumann entropy of the density matrix @xmath149 ) we conclude that @xmath150 , which corresponds to our entanglement measure between the two blocks of qubits , is always @xmath151 .",
    "this holds true even for non symmetric bi - partitions of the complete system . regardless of the number of qubits ,",
    "entanglement in grover s adiabatic algorithm is always a _ bounded _",
    "quantity for any @xmath17 , in contrast with the results obtained in the previous sections for shor s factoring algorithm and for the exact cover problem .",
    "grover s adiabatic quantum algorithm essentially makes use of very little entanglement , but even this bounded quantity of quantum correlations is enough to give a square root speedup .",
    "we have explicitly calculated the von neumann entropy for @xmath152 .",
    "because the rank of the reduced density matrix is two , there are only two non - vanishing eigenvalues that contribute in the calculation which are    @xmath153    we analyze the limit @xmath154 for @xmath155 and @xmath156 separately :    _ ( i ) @xmath155 _    in the limit of very high @xmath78 we can approximate the ground state energy given in equation ( [ ground ] ) by    @xmath157    therefore , the quantity    @xmath158    diverges at @xmath132 , which implies that this limit can not be correct for that value of the parameter .",
    "the closer we are to @xmath131 , the bigger is @xmath159 . in this limit",
    "we find that    @xmath160    where all these quantities tend to zero as @xmath154 .",
    "it is important to note that the convergence of the limit depends on the value of @xmath159 or , in other words , how close to @xmath132 we are .",
    "the closer we are to @xmath132 , the slower is the convergence , and therefore any quantity depending on these parameters ( such as the entropy ) will converge slower to its assimptotical value . for the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix",
    "we then find that when @xmath154    @xmath161",
    "so @xmath162 and @xmath163 , and therefore the assimptotical entropy is    @xmath164    the convergence of this quantity is slower as we move towards @xmath165 .    _",
    "( ii ) @xmath131 _    we begin our analysis by evaluating the quantities at @xmath131 and then taking the limit of big size of the system .",
    "we have that @xmath166 . from here",
    "it is easy to get the approximations    @xmath167    and therefore    @xmath168    so @xmath169 and @xmath170 . according with ( [ eigensdos ] )",
    "we can evaluate the finite size corrections to this behavior and find the scaling of the entropy with the size of the system for very large @xmath78 .",
    "the final result for the entropy at the critical point reads    @xmath171    note that the entropy remains bounded and tends to @xmath105 for @xmath131 as an square root in the exponential of the size of the system , which is the typical factor in grover s quantum algorithm .",
    "we have represented the evolution of the entanglement entropy as a function of @xmath17 for different sizes of the system in fig .",
    "[ pic ] and have plotted in fig .",
    "[ scale ] the maximum value of the entropy along the computation as a function of the size of the system according to the expression given in equation ( [ scaling ] ) .",
    "we can now compare the two plots with fig .",
    "[ mix-300 ] and fig .",
    "[ ent ] in the previous section .",
    "the behavior for the entropy in grover s adiabatic algorithm is dramatically different to the one observed in the np - complete problem .",
    "entanglement gets saturated in grover s adiabatic algorithm _ even at the critical point _ , which is reminiscent of short ranged quantum correlations in quantum spin chains .",
    "let us note that , in the limit of infinite size , the quantum state in grover s algorithm is separable with respect to any bipartition of the system ( and therefore not entangled , as it is a pure state ) for any @xmath17 except for @xmath165 .",
    "all the entanglement along the algorithm is concentrated at this point , but this entanglement is still a bounded quantity and actually equal to @xmath105 .",
    "consequently , a small amount of entanglement appears essentially only at one point when the size of the system is big , whereas the rest of the algorithm needs to handle just separable states .",
    "we point out that these results apply as well to the traditional discrete - time implementation of grover s searching algorithm , as the states between iterations are the same as in the adiabatic version for discrete @xmath17 values .",
    "in this paper we have studied the scaling of the entanglement entropy in several quantum algorithms . in particular , we have analytically proven that shor s factoring algorithm makes use of an exponentially large amount of entanglement between the target register and the source register after the modular exponentiation operation , which in turn implies the impossibility of an efficient classical simulation by means of the protocol of ref .",
    "furthermore , we have provided numerical evidence for a universal linear scaling of the entropy with the size of the system together with a polynomially small gap in a quantum algorithm by adiabatic evolution devised to solve the np - complete problem exact cover , therefore obtaining a polynomial - time quantum algorithm which would involve exponential resources if simulated classically , in analogy to shor s algorithm .",
    "universality of this result follows from the fact that the quantum adiabatic algorithm evolves close to a quantum phase transition and the properties at the critical region do not depend on particular details of the microscopic hamiltonian ( instance ) such as interactions among the spins or local magnetic fields .",
    "we have also proven that the von neumann entropy remains a bounded quantity in grover s adiabatic algorithm regardless of the size of the system even at the critical point .",
    "more concretely , the maximum entropy approaches to one as an square root in the size of the system , which is the typical grover s scaling factor .",
    "our results show that studying the scaling of the entropy is a useful way of analyzing entanglement production in quantum computers .",
    "results from other fields of physics @xcite can be directly applied to bring further insight into the analysis of quantum correlations .",
    "different entanglement scaling laws follow from different situations according to the amount of correlations involved , as can be seen in table [ scalinglaws ] .",
    "a quantum algorithm can be understood as the simulation of a system evolving close to a quantum phase transition .",
    "the amount of entanglement involved depends on the effective dimensionality of the system , which in turn governs the possibilities of certain efficient classical simulation protocols .",
    "these scaling laws provide a new way of understanding some aspects from one - way quantum computation .",
    "it is known that the so - called cluster state of the one - way quantum computer can be generated by using ising - like interactions on a planar two - dimensional lattice @xcite .",
    "this fact can be related to the linear ( in the size of a box ) behavior of entropy for spin systems in two dimensions .",
    "one - dimensional models seem not to be able to efficiently create the highly - entangled cluster state @xcite .",
    "again , this fact can be traced to the logarithmic scaling law of the entropy in spin chains which is insufficient to handle the large amount of entanglement to carry out _",
    "e.g. _ shor s algorithm .",
    "note also that @xmath173 dimensional systems bring unnecessarily large entanglement .",
    "quantum phase transitions stand as the more demanding systems in terms of entanglement .",
    "they are very hard to simulate classically .",
    "it is then reasonable to try to bring np - complete problems to a quantum phase transition setup , which quantum mechanics handles naturally .",
