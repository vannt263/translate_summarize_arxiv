    "observations of stellar orbits in the proximity of the enigmatic radio source sgr  a * located at the very dynamical center of our galaxy ( reid and brunthaler 2004 ) have established that it is a 4 @xmath0  black hole ( ghez et al .",
    "2008 ; gillessen et al .",
    "the relative proximity of sgr  a * compared to agns allows us to observe the spectacular activities of the central engine at remarkably small spatial scales .",
    "the variable continuum flux of agns is known to signal activities of the central engine and is detected throughout the entire electromagnetic spectrum with time scales ranging from days to years ( e.g. , arshakian et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the bulk of the continuum flux is believed to be generated in the accretion disk , where the localization of the source of variable continuum emission becomes essential for our understanding of the launching and transport of energy in active galaxies .",
    "sgr  a * provides the best laboratory to study the properties of low - luminosity accreting black holes .",
    "the emission from sgr  a * is therefore the subject of intense scrutiny , which will have a long - lasting impact on our understanding of the radiatively inefficient accretion flow into , as well as outflows from , massive black holes .",
    "the time scale for variability is proportional to the mass of the black hole , thus sgr  a * , which is a hundred times closer to us than the next nearest example , presents an unparalleled opportunity to closely study the processes by which gas is captured , accreted or ejected , by characterizing the time variability over scales of minutes to years .",
    "the luminosity of sgr  a * is thought to be due to partial capture of thermal winds from a neighboring cluster of massive stars .",
    "however , the bolometric luminosity of sgr  a * ( @xmath1 ) is several orders of magnitude lower than expected for the estimated accretion rate , prompting a number of theoretical models to explain its very low radiative efficiency and matching the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of its quiescent emission .",
    "the broad - band spectrum of sgr  a * peaks at sub - millimeter wavelengths , which is the dividing line between optically thin infrared and optically thick millimeter and radio emission .",
    "the existence of flare emission from sgr  a * is now well established in both optically thick and thin regimes .",
    "what is really exciting is that we are beginning to peer into the closest supermassive black hole and are discovering rapid , time variability that likely stems from gas dynamical flow and radiation emitted very near the event horizon .",
    "the emission from sgr  a * consists of quasi - steady and variable components ( e.g. , hornstein et al . 2007 ) .",
    "a variety of models have been proposed to explain the steady emission from sgr  a * by fitting its sed  for example a thin accretion disk , a disk and jet , outflow , an advection - dominated accretion flow , radiatively inefficient accretion flow , and advection - dominated inflow / outflow solutions .",
    "these studies have not been able to uniquely identify the underlying mechanism to explain the underluminous nature of sgr  a*. however , more recently , detailed mhd simulations of the inner disk of radiatively inefficient flow of a few schwarzschild radius r@xmath2 , have found low - level flux variations ( `` quiescent '' emission ) and strong transient ( `` flare '' ) emission in almost all wavelength bands ( e.g. , goldston et al . 2005 ; chan et al . 2009 ; moscibrodzka et al .",
    "these simulations have become increasingly sophisticated by adding more physics , such as gr effects and a kerr rather than a schwarzschild black hole . in particular , these theoretical studies investigate the structure and the physical parameters of the hot synchrotron emitting plasma in the vicinity of sgr  a * at near - ir ( nir ) wavelengths and predict long - term evolution of its emission .",
    "for example , the variability of emission on a 100 and 1000-hour time scale was predicted from radiatively inefficient accretion flow .",
    "goldston et al .",
    "( 2005 ) argue that the main reason for the time variability of the quasi - steady component is due to changes in the magnetic field .    in a more recent mhd simulation study , chan et al .",
    "( 2009 ) find that mhd turbulence can only produce quiescent variability of a factor of two in the luminosity of sgr  a*. the strong nir flaring of sgr  a * is then explained by the external material from the outer disk raining down on the inner disk , thus producing transient outbursts , as seen in nir and x - ray wavelengths . in this picture ,",
    "strong but short term qpos are predicted to emerge in the simulated light curves .",
    "lastly , as we heard from c. gammie and f. yuan in this conference , moscibrodzka et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have constructed radiative models of sgr  a * and have included the black hole spin .",
    "their study is most consistent with a black hole spin of a=0.9 , where a is the spin parameter , as it is likely to show time - variable emission in almost all wavelength bands .",
    "there are indeed many mhd simulations of accretion disks around massive black holes , all having their own limitations and assumptions .",
    "given the limitations and uncertainties in each simulated light curve , these studies can only be demonstrative if the statistical properties of the simulated light curves are in reasonable agreement with the statistics drawn from the observed light curve of sgr  a*. variability of the nir emission of sgr  a * is a key carrier of information regarding the dynamics of the accretion flow .",
    "short ( @xmath3minutes ) time scales probe the transient acceleration of particles associated with the dissipation of kinetic and magnetic energy on small scales within the accretion flow .",
    "intermediate time scales ( hours ) probe the dynamical evolution of the accretion flow on a timescale of a few orbits , as in the theoretical study of chan et al .",
    "longer time scales ( days to months ) probe the crucial and unexplored dynamics of the stochastic feeding of the inner accretion flow from larger radii and the draining of the inner flow onto the black hole .",
    "future variability measurements of sgr  a * are expected to show the low - level accretion flow that produces quiescent flux variations of a factor of 2 whereas the flaring activity from transient events is expected to show flux variations of about a factor ten .",
    "previous nir measurements have characterized the intrinsic variability time scale of sgr  a * by using structure function analysis , which is widely used in the study of agn light curves in x - rays ( e.g. , kataoka et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the structure function ( sf ) is the mean difference of pairs of flux measurement separated by time lag @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath5 ^ 2>$ ] ( simonetti et al .",
    "the slope of the structure function @xmath6 ( where sf@xmath7 ) is determined by the slope of the power spectral density .",
    "it turns out that the slope of the structure function is related to the index of the power spectrum of fluctuations @xmath8 where power spectrum p @xmath9 .",
    "the relationship between @xmath8 and @xmath6 is approximately @xmath10 when @xmath8 is greater than or equal one ( kataoka et al .",
    "flicker noise with @xmath11 or @xmath6=0 has been identified in the power spectrum of many agns .",
    "breaks in the power spectra are seen in both agn and x - ray binaries , with the break timescale scaling with black hole mass and bolometric luminosity ( i.e. mass accretion rate ) , mchardy et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "structure function analysis has also been carried out with several nights of keck observations of sgr  a * ( do et al .",
    "different nights of keck observations ( do et al . 1990 ) show values of @xmath6 varying between 0.26 and 1.37 with lag times ranging between 1 to 40 minutes . a follow - up work by meyer et al .",
    "( 2009 ) investigated the long time range of up to four years to determine the turnover in the structure function analysis of nir data .",
    "these authors find a slope of 2.1 with a characteristic time scale for the turnover at around 154 min , though with a lage uncertainity due to the poor sampling of nir data on long time scales .",
    "we have used data taken with vlt and xmm observations on 2007 , april 4 at nir and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "figures 1a , b show the structure function plots of nir and x - ray observations that are sensitive only to time lags ranging between 30sec to @xmath3100min and 100sec to 800min for the vlt and xmm data , respectively .",
    "the power - law fit to the nir data implies slope of 1.05@xmath12 in the structure function suggesting random walk noise .",
    "the value of @xmath6 from vlt measurements is consistent with keck measurements presented by do et al .",
    "( 2009 ) but difffer with the value of @xmath6=2.1 determined from combining vlt and keck data for four years ( meyer et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the turnover in the vlt structure function is seen at @xmath13min .",
    "the turnover is either due to time lags that are not sampled well at large time lags or due to a lack of correlation between signals with different time lags .",
    "we also note variability at less than 1 minute at nir wavelengths ( see also the analysis by dodds - eden et al .",
    "2010 and do et al . 2009 ) .",
    "there is no evidence for qpos in the time domain that was searched which is consistent with the results given by do et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and meyer et al .",
    "the nature of qpo activity of a hot spot orbiting sgr  a * is hotly debated mainly because of the low signal - to - noise and possibly due to an intermittent nature of such a behavior ( e.g. , eckart et al . 2006 ) .    unlike the structure function plot of nir data which is fit a by a single power law , longer duration of xmm observations , as shown in in fig .",
    "1b , give different characterization of the variability of sgr  a * in x - rays .",
    "we note a steep rise at short time scales , similar to that of nir , followed by a plateau with time lags ranging between 30 and 300 minutes before a steepening of the structure function is noted again at longer time scales .",
    "due to limited sensitivity and 100-second sampling of x - ray data , the flat part of the sf with time lags of few minutes indicate that there is no detectable minute time scale variability and that the emission is dominated by white noise .",
    "the plateau time lags range between 30 and 300 minutes is also consistent with a white noise where there is no correlation of signals . at time",
    "lags greater than 300 minutes , the correlation begins again and most of the power appears to be in this time domain .",
    "the x - ray shape of the structure function plot of sgr a * is remarkably similar to that of mrk 421 except that the time lags of mrk 421 are an order of magnitude larger than that detected for sgr a*. for comparison , figure 4c shows a structure function for the light curve of mrk 421 measured by asca ( kataoka et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "previous light curve analysis of radio data at 7 mm have shown that the duration of typical radio flares is about two hours , which is similar to the duration of flares observed at sub - mm wavelengths ( yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "2006 ; marrone et al . 2006 ) .",
    "this is consisent with the power spectrum analysis of the time variability of sgr a * which suggested intraday variability at 3 mm ( mauerhan et al . 2005 ) .",
    "based on the duration of radio flares , it was argued that cooling could be due to adiabatic expansion , with the implication that flare activity can be caused by an expanding plasma blob ( yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "2006 ) . the measurements in support of this picture indicated the peak frequency of the emission ( e.g. , the initial optically thin near - ir flare ) shifts toward lower frequencies ( sub - millimeter , millimeter and then radio ) as a self - absorbed synchrotron source expands adiabatically near the acceleration site .",
    "to investigate the short time scale variability , we have constructed several structure function plots of sgr  a * from radio variability data taken with the vla mainly from a multi - wavelength observing campaign that took place in april and may 2008 .",
    "we present three sets of plots from three different days of vla observations .",
    "figures 2a , b show the structure function plots of sgr a * indicating time scales ranging roughly between 1 to 300 minutes in the variability of sgr  a * at 7 and 13 mm on 2008 , may 11 , respectively . most of the power in the time variability is detected between one and three hour time scales , consistent with earlier light curve analysis .",
    "the fit to the slope of the structure function at long time scales is a power law giving values 0.60@xmath14 and 1.18@xmath150.21 at 7 and 13 mm , respectively . on the short time scale ,",
    "we note a shallower slope of the structure function with large error bars indicating that there is no minute time scale variability in radio wavelength on this day .",
    "this is consistent with measurements errors in amplitude ( white noise ) .    to examine the frequency dependence of the variability of sgr  a * , fig .",
    "3 shows the structure function plots based on data taken simultaneously on 2008 , may 8 at 7 and 13 mm , respectively .",
    "both plots show the presence of minute time scale variability going down to @xmath30.1 minute .",
    "the power law fit to the structure function give different values for short and long time scales ; the power law fit to the slope of the 7 and 13 mm data at short time scales gives values 0.18@xmath16 and 0.26@xmath17 whereas the power law fit to the long time scale slope , are estimated to be 1.27@xmath150.13 and 1.35@xmath150.29 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the transitions from a shallow to a steep slope are 30 and 60 minutes at 7 and 13 mm , respectively .",
    "the long time variability is identified with the typical two hour duration of flaring events in radio wavelengths .",
    "the transition time scales from 30 and 60 minutes at these two different wavelengths are likely to be due to optical depth effect in an adiabatic expanding synchrotron source .",
    "previous time delay measurements which show a time delay of 20 - 40 minutes between the peaks of emission at 7 and 13 mm ( yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "2009 ) as well as the stretching of the duration of the flare emission in the time domain at lower frequencies .",
    "the latter effect is likely to be responsible for the transition in the slope seen in the structure function analysis .",
    "lastly , figure 4 shows another structure function plot and the corresponding power spectral density based on data taken on 2008 , may 10 .",
    "the shape of the structure function indicates multiple slopes .",
    "a power law fit to the slope at long time scales gives a value of 0.84@xmath150.54 which is consistent with typical slopes of other structure functions shown in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "what is new in figure 4a is the appearance of a number of dips in the structure function indicating a possible qpo activity .",
    "the strongest dip is seen around 20 minutes followed by weaker dips at 50 and 100 minutes .",
    "similar dips are also noted in the structure function at 13 mm taken simultaneously with the 7 mm data . the power spectral density , as presented in fig .",
    "4b , gives another presentation of a possible evidence of qpo activity .",
    "the best - fitting power laws appear to have power law index of 0.6 which falls somewhere between white noise and flicker noise .",
    "deviations from a power law fit to the power structural density could be the result of dips detected in the structure function plot .",
    "our multi - wavelength monitoring of sgr a * characterizes the intrinsic time variability of sgr  a * by studying structure function of the observed light curves . unlike near - ir structure function plots that can be fit by single power laws , radio and x - ray structure function plots are fit by multiple power laws in different time lag domains .",
    "structure function analysis of the data presented in near - ir , x - ray and radio data suggest that most of the power falls in the long time scale fluctuation of the emission from sgr  a * and no obvious qpo activity .",
    "we also note short time scale variability at these wavelengths when the data are sampled properly .",
    "in particular , the minute - time scale variability is best seen at nir wavelengths in fig .",
    "the structure function also goes down well below one minute at radio wavelengths showing a slope which is not completely flat at the shortest lags .",
    "the best case for such minute time scale variability is seen in figure 3a at 7 mm where the slope is not consistent with being flat for lag times less than 0.3 minute .",
    "the square of the mean of the measurement errors for 3.3sec sample data at 7 mm is @xmath18 jy@xmath19 which is more than a factor of two less than the amplitude of the structure function 2@xmath20 jy@xmath19 at the shortest lag time .",
    "assuming that the sub - minute time scale variability in nir and radio wavelengths are significant , they place a strong constraint on the size of the region from which variable emission arises . using light travel time arguments",
    ", the minute - time scale variability gives an upper limit to the scale length of radio variation @xmath31/8 au .",
    "for comparison , the schwarzschild radius of sgr  a * is 10 @xmath21as or 0.1 au at the distance of 8 kpc ( doeleman et al .",
    "2008 ) . assuming that the emission is optically thick at 7 mm ,",
    "then the inferred brightness temperature is @xmath22k corresponding to particle energy @xmath23mev .",
    "these high energy particles have relativistic speeds and can in principle leave the gravitational potential of sgr  a * in the form of outflow .",
    "the inferred scale length corresponding to one - minute light travel time is comparable to to the time averaged spatially resolved 0.1au scale observed at 1.3 mm by doeleman et al .",
    "the quiescent variable emission from sgr  a * could then be interpreted mainly as an ensemble average of numerous flares that are detected on minute - time scale .",
    "alternatively , the short time scale emission or quiescent variability could be due to fluctuations in the accretion flow of sgr  a * due to magnetic field fluctuations resulting from mri , as recent mhd simulations in a number of studies indicate .",
    "a more detailed account of these results will be given elsewhere .",
