    "therefore , with sufficiently large values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 satisfying the conditions 1 ) and 2 ) , any pair , @xmath224 in the gaussian capacity region can be approached .",
    "in this paper , we have designed the optimal labelling rule on the trellises of the two users ( with equal average power constraints on the two users ) to approach any rate pair within the capacity region .",
    "some possible directions for further work are as follows :    * in this paper , we have assumed equal average power constraint for both the users . if unequal power constraints are considered , then it is interesting to see if rotation between the alphabets provides enlargement of the cc capacity region .",
    "* we have designed tcm schemes with unequal rates for the two users even though the two users have equal average power constraints .",
    "however , when rates proportional to the power constraint of each user has to be transmitted ( with unequal average power constraints on the two users ) , tcm schemes have to be designed with pairs of signal sets which have unequal power constraints and unequal size .",

    "<S> in this paper , code pairs based on trellis coded modulation are proposed over psk signal sets for a two - user gaussian multiple access channel . in order to provide unique decodability property to the receiver and to maximally enlarge the constellation constrained ( cc ) capacity region , a relative angle of rotation </S>",
    "<S> is introduced between the signal sets . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , the structure of the _ sum alphabet _ of two psk signal sets is exploited to prove that ungerboeck labelling on the trellis of each user maximizes the guaranteed minimum squared euclidean distance , @xmath0 in the _ sum trellis_. hence , such a labelling scheme can be used systematically to construct trellis code pairs for a two - user gmac to approach _ any rate pair _ within the capacity region .    </S>",
