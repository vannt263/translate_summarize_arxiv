    "more than a decade ago photoluminescence spectroscopy measurements @xcite revealed the six excitonic emission lines of cdte quantum dots ( qd ) doped with manganese ( mn ) ions .",
    "these lines were unambiguously associated with @xmath1 projections on the @xmath2-axis of the mn spin @xmath3 and provided a direct evidence of its exchange interaction with electrons and holes .",
    "nowadays , the optically active qds with a single magnetic dopant are intensively studied as promising solotronic devices @xcite .",
    "a series of recent experiments support these ambitious expectations .",
    "the coherent precession of a localized mn spin embedded in a cdte quantum dot has been recently probed @xcite and the exciton luminescence of cdte / znte qds in the presence of a cobalt ion was observed @xcite .",
    "the formation of singlet and triplet states in self - assembled heavy - hole ( hh ) qds in the presence of a mn atom has been discussed recently @xcite .",
    "the experimental studies of lger _",
    "_ @xcite revealed that the in - plane qd asymmetry and mn position competitively contribute to the level structure of the mn ` dressed ' excitons and lead to very different photoluminescence spectra .",
    "spin population trapping and optically dressed states under strong resonant excitation have been reported @xcite .",
    "a study on the valence band mixing of heavy hole excitons has been performed by kyrychenko and kossut @xcite .",
    "bree _ et al . _",
    "@xcite emphasized the different optical properties of mn - doped iii - v qds ( e.g inas ) due to the acceptor character of the magnetic atom @xcite .",
    "later on thuberg _ et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated theoretically the ultrafast light - induced dynamics in mn - doped inas qd .",
    "the enhanced manipulation of the mn spin via optical stark effect was addressed both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite prepared a positively charged exciton and then recorded the dynamics of the mn spin when interacting with a single hole . quite recently ,",
    "@xcite tuned the exciton emission spectrum of a single mn - doped qd embedded in a micropillar cavity to its single mode .",
    "this opens the way to photonic devices based on magnetic impurities .",
    "the non - trivial effects of the mn - exciton exchange interaction are rooted in the simultaneous spin - flip processes of the mn and electron or hole spins .",
    "typically , the fully interacting exciton states of the magnetically doped system become mixtures of ` exchange - free ' bright and dark excitons ( i.e exciton states calculated in the absence of exchange interaction ; for details and notation see section ii ) .",
    "when calculated theoretically , the time - dependent populations of the latter states develop the so - called exchange - induced rabi ( exr ) oscillations .",
    "@xcite exploited this mechanism and simulated the optical switching of the mn spin by optically addressing a heavy - hole exciton .",
    "for purely hh systems the electron - mn ( e - mn ) exchange is fully responsible for the appearance of exr oscillations .",
    "it couples bright and dark excitons with opposite electron spins @xcite while the hole - mn ( h - mn ) interaction contributes only to the splitting of the six absorption peaks via the diagonal ising part .",
    "the heavy - hole spin flip processes are prevented by selection rules @xcite . in turn , a light - hole ( lh ) exciton experiences both electron and hole spin flips @xcite . in this case",
    "the exciton states of the qd - mn system are mixtures of more than two ` exchange - free ' excitons , which at first glance prevents one to distinguish effects of the h - mn exchange alone or to selectively flip the lh spin whereas conserving the electronic spin .",
    "the optical generation of lhs by highly focused optical - vortex beams has been theoretically investigated in a recent work @xcite .    in this work we consider from a theoretical point of view",
    "two issues which to our best knowledge were not systematically studied for mn - doped qds supporting light - hole excitons : ( i ) the role of the mn position on the exciton or biexciton mixing as well as on absorption spectra and ( ii ) the h - mn exchange - induced rabi oscillations of lh excitons and biexcitons .",
    "let us note that previous studies on electronic structure @xcite or purely hh systems @xcite emphasized that the exchange interaction with the mn atom depends strongly on its position and changes the energy spectrum .",
    "our calculations illustrate how the position dependent e - mn and h - mn exchange controls the light - hole exciton mixing which in turn changes the absorption spectra and the exr oscillations .",
    "let us stress that the mn location can be experimentally controlled @xcite .",
    "it is well known that a light - hole ground state in optically active qds can be experimentally achieved either by tuning the aspect ratio ( i.e height / radius ratio ) @xcite or by applying tensile strain on the structure @xcite . here",
    "we take the first route and investigate qds whose dominant light - hole character of ground state excitons is controlled by the aspect ratio .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section ii presents the essential features of our model and formalism , section iii contains the results on lh excitons ( subsection a ) and mixed biexcitons ( subsection b ) .",
    "the conclusions are given in section iv .",
    "the starting point of our study is the calculation of the single - particle wavefunctions for electrons and holes confined in a cylindrical qd . to this end",
    "we use the four - band kohn - luttinger ( kl ) hamiltonian for valence band states and the @xmath0 theory ( see ref .   for more details ) .",
    "the confinement potential leads to the following definition of the envelope functions ( @xmath4 and @xmath2 are cylindrical coordinates ) : @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the orbital quantum number , @xmath7 is the @xmath8-th zero of the bessel function @xmath9 and @xmath10 are eigenfunctions associated with the vertical confinement , that is @xmath11 for @xmath12 even and @xmath13 for @xmath12 odd .",

    "the hole states are linear combinations of basis vectors @xmath16 : @xmath17 and the bloch band - edge states @xmath18 .",
    "heavy ( light ) hole states correspond to @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the electrons in the conduction band are described by a single - band effective mass hamiltonian , its eigenstates @xmath21 being described by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the electron spin .",
    "the energies in the conduction band are denoted by @xmath24 and the hole energies by @xmath25 .    at the next step",
    "we use the single - particle functions to calculate many - body interacting configurations ( excitons , biexcitons etc . ) and energies in the absence of the mn atom .",
    "the qd is described by the hamiltonian @xmath26 : @xmath27 written in terms of creation / annihilation operators for electrons and holes .",
    "the single - particle indices @xmath28 and @xmath29 are restricted to @xmath30 and @xmath31 in view of numerical diagonalization via configuration interaction method ( more details are given in section iii ) .    in eq.([hhzero ] ) we singled out the direct ( @xmath32 ) and exchange ( @xmath33 ) electron - hole interactions .",
    "the latter has both short - range and long - range components .",
    "the splitting between the two pairs of bright and dark excitons is mainly given by the short - range exchange @xcite while the anisotropic ( non - local ) long - range exchange contributes to the fine structure splitting ( fss ) and mixing of the bright excitons .",
    "under strong tensile strain the anisotropic exchange interaction increases and one can switch the ground state of a qd from heavy - hole to light - hole @xcite . for isotropic",
    "qd confinement potential the bright exciton splitting vanishes @xcite",
    ". moreover , for the qds considered here the strain is assumed to be small and therefore the fss is neglected .",
    "the calculated eigenstates and eigenvalues of @xmath26 are denoted by @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    a useful description of the many - body states ( mbs ) @xmath34 is given by the spins of the electrons and holes which occupy well defined single - particle states . for example , the lh exciton state containing a spin - up electron in the conduction band and a light - hole of spin @xmath36 is denoted by @xmath37 .",

    "it is convenient to write down the second quantized form @xmath53 of @xmath54 in the basis @xmath55 .",
    "the matrix elements of e - mn and h - mn exchange are found by standard calculation .",
    "for example : @xmath56 the product @xmath57 in eq.([e - mn-2q ] ) contains spin flip operators @xmath58 which mix the ` exchange - free ' states @xmath59 , and the ising part @xmath60 which would simply turn each state @xmath34 into a manifold @xmath59 with a fine structure controlled by @xmath51 .",
    "note that the matrix elements of the exchange interaction depend explicitly on the electronic wavefunctions evaluated at the mn position .",
    "the hole - mn exchange acquires a more complicated expression because a given luttinger spinor is generally a combination of lh and hh states .",
    "consequently for a pair of states @xmath61 the matrix elements @xmath62 must be multiplied by their weights in the luttinger spinor .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the qd - mn system finally reads as : @xmath63    the eigenstates of @xmath64 can be written as : @xmath65 are found by diagonalization . for further use",
    "we introduce the weight of the ` exchange - free ' state @xmath59 in a fully interacting configuration @xmath66 as @xmath67 .",
    "the light - matter interaction is treated classically , the corresponding hamiltonian being : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the free electron mass , @xmath70 is the pulse envelope and @xmath71 is its frequency .",

    "the spin - conserving hole relaxation is the fastest process described by the relaxation time for holes @xmath92 where @xmath93 are hole levels having the same spin .",
    "spin - conserving relaxation for electrons in the conduction band will not be considered here as the numerical simulations presented in section ii involve only the lowest single - particle states from the conduction band .",
    "the hole spin relaxation is neglected as it is a much slower process .",
    "the population of a given state @xmath59 is given by the diagonal matrix element @xmath94 whereas the coherence between two states is given by off - diagonal elements .",
    "the statistical average of the @xmath2-projection of the mn spin is given by : @xmath95    for a fixed initial configuration , the von neumann - lindblad equation is numerically solved on a truncated fock subspace containing the states involved in optical transitions or spin - flip processes .",
    "in this work we consider cylindrical qds whose single - particle hole ground state achieves a dominant lh character by appropriate tuning of the aspect ratio @xmath96 .",
    "for example , we find that for @xmath97 nm and @xmath98 nm the highest energy single - particle valence states of the kl hamiltonian are up to @xmath99 made of @xmath100-shell light holes ( @xmath101 ) and the next two states are mostly ( @xmath102 ) @xmath100-shell hh - like ( @xmath103 ) . due to the valence band mixing",
    "the mostly lh luttinger spinor has smaller @xmath104-shell hh weights as well ( e.g. a @xmath105 hh component @xmath106 ) but the total quantum number @xmath107 is conserved .",
    "the existence of a lh ground state for tall cylindrical quantum dots is also confirmed by atomistic tight - binding calculations @xcite .    for our system the gap between the higest energy lh and hh doublets",
    "is approximatively 7mev .",
    "it also turns out that the next hole states which could be optically coupled to the @xmath100-shell electronic states are located 27mev below the highest energy hh states while the next electron states are 80mev above the lowest energy @xmath100-shell doublet .",
    "systematic numerical simulations show that by enlarging @xmath31 and @xmath30 the energies of the exciton or mixed biexciton states considered in this work are modified by only a few @xmath108evs and their mixing with other configurations is negligible .",
    "typically , a good convergence is already achieved for @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the position of the manganese atom is given in cylindrical coordinates by @xmath111 .",

    "in contrast , by shifting the magnetic impurity from origin the exchange interaction couples @xmath104-shell components as well @xcite . the effect of the valence band mixing will be further discussed in section iii b.    in the numerical calculations we use the following values of the exchange couplings : @xmath117ev@xmath118 , @xmath119ev@xmath118 .",
    "the luttinger parameters for cdte are @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 .",
    "@xmath123 typically ranges from 0 to few tenths of @xmath108ev for large strain values @xcite and insures a slow relaxation ( few @xmath108s ) of the mn spin .",
    "the numerical simulations discussed in this section were obtained for @xmath124ev .",
    "we found similar results for other values of @xmath123 .",

    "the mn spin can be fixed by applying a magnetic field along the @xmath2 axis .",
    "note that one can turn off this magnetic field and still have stable orientation of the mn spin , due to rather long relaxation times of the mn spin .",

    "then , a peak corresponding to each exciton appears in the absorption spectrum associated to the ` exchange - free ' hamiltonian in eq.([hzero ] ) ( not shown ) . using the fermi golden rule one can also calculate the light - hole exciton absorption spectra of the fully interacting qd - mn system for several positions of the mn atom along the @xmath2-axis , while keeping @xmath114 .",
    "[ xspectra ] shows that while the single - peak picture still holds for @xmath125 pulses , a multiple peak structure develops for @xmath131 polarized light .",

    "we also find that if the mn atom is located even closer to the cap point @xmath134 nm a single @xmath131 peak survives , which roughly coincides with the peak associated to @xmath125 polarization ( not shown ) .",
    "note that the energy range covered by the four @xmath131 peaks shrinks from 1.6mev in fig.[xspectra](a ) to 0.2mev in fig.[xspectra](b ) while the single @xmath125 peak position does not change significantly as the mn location varies .",
    "we find that the complex peak structure is due to the exchange - induced mixing between four non - interacting excitons . from eq.([e - mn-2q ] ) one can easily check that @xmath135 via e - mn exchange and @xmath136 via h - mn exchange .",

    "this dependence of the biexciton mixing on the mn position is due to the different diagonal ( ising ) shifts of the bright and dark mixed biexcitons .",

    "figure[occupationb ] shows the rabi oscillations of the bright and dark biexcitons for several positions of the mn atom .",
    "the oscillation amplitude reaches a maximum at @xmath175 nm where the two biexcitons are strongly mixed ( see fig.[b1](a ) ) .",
    "the oscillations are much faster ( the period ranges from 5 to 10ps ) than the ones presented in the previous subsection , because the coulomb gap between the mixed biexcitons is much larger than the energy spacing between the lh excitons .",
    "we stress that the effect of the h - mn exchange alone can be singled out from the dynamics of the mixed biexcitons irrespective of the mn position on the @xmath2-axis , in contrast to the lh case where clear exchange - induced rabi oscillations are observed only if the mn atom is closer to the cylinder edge .    the oscillations in fig.[occupationb ] were obtained without taking into account the intraband hole relaxation processes .",
    "the separation between the lh and hh states ( i.e the relaxation energy ) is around 7 mev which is below the frequency of the lo phonons in cdte ( this is typically around 22 mev - see e.g. ref .. this means that in our case the relaxation is mostly due to la phonons .",
    "the reported values for this relaxation time range @xmath188 from 7 - 20 ps ( see e.g. ref . ) .",

    "eventually the system settles down to the @xmath100-shell biexciton state ( @xmath194ps ) .",
    "we notice a small population of the state @xmath195 ; this is due to the h - mn interaction which couples the lh and hh spins through the transitions @xmath196 .",
    "the few mev gap between lh and hh exciton levels prevents a strong coupling and explains the small and slow occupation of @xmath195 .",
    "@xmath197 is suppressed as the mn atom approaches the edge of the cylinder ( not shown ) .",
    "let us stress that the rather fast switching between the mixed and @xmath100-shell biexciton requires _ both _ h - mn exchange and intraband relaxation .",
    "indeed , in the absence of the mn atom the transition @xmath198 can only be achieved through hole spin - flip relaxation which is a much slower process ( i.e. nanoseconds @xcite ) .",
    "otherwise stated , the exchange interaction with a magnetic dopant reduces the lifetime of mixed biexcitons .",

    "as long as @xmath201 these minor components also contribute to the exchange interaction and bring in more spin - flip processes .",
    "consequently , the quadruple structure of the lh excitons holds only approximately , in the sense that other smaller weight configurations contribute as well to a fully interacting state .",
    "we find however that the results on distinctive lh spin - flip processes as the mn atom approaches the cylinder edges still hold .",
    "figure[inplane ] shows that the exchange - induced rabi oscillations of the biexciton populations are still visible for non - vanishing radial coordinate @xmath202 ( i.e they are similar to the ones in fig.[brelax ] ) .",
    "note that the populations of the exchange - free biexcitons @xmath172 and @xmath203 do not add to unity anymore as their minor components are exchange - coupled to other biexciton states with different @xmath43 as well ( we did not include their populations in fig.[inplane ] ) .",
    "the effect is negligible if @xmath112 ( see figs.[inplane](a ) and ( b ) ) because the vertical confinement quantum number of the largest @xmath104-shell component of the mostly lh luttinger spinor is even ( i.e @xmath204 ) and therefore the associated function @xmath11 vanishes .",
    "this does not happen at @xmath200 nm and a more pronounced decrease of the oscillation amplitude is noticed in figs.[inplane](c ) and ( d ) .",
    "we obtained similar results for qds of different sizes , provided the aspect ratio @xmath96 leads to ` mostly ' lh ground state excitons .",
    "we provide a theoretical study of the interplay of electron - mn and hole - mn exchange interactions in single mn - doped cylindrical qds . the dependence of the exchange interaction on the manganese position is explicitly included in the numerical simulations .",
    "its effects can be traced from the multiple peak structure of the light - hole absorption spectrum but also from the induced rabi oscillations of the lh excitons and mixed biexcitons .    by changing the location of the manganese atom on the @xmath2-axis we identified two regimes of the light - hole exciton mixing .",
    "the ` quadruple ' regime is characterized by simultaneous e - mn and h - mn exchange couplings , the interacting excitons being typically made of four noninteracting states .",
    "this regime is suitable neither for the observation of the exchange - induced rabi oscillations nor for the preparation of an exciton with a dominant light - hole spin .",
    "the second regime is achieved by placing the mn atom closer to the edge of the cylinder , such that the e - mn exchange is vanishingly small while the h - mn interaction is still important . in this case",
    "the fully interacting lh excitons are mostly made of two non - interacting excitons which are mixed only through hole spin flip processes .",
    "moreover , one recovers large amplitude rabi oscillations between bright and dark lh excitons .",
    "we also investigated the dynamics of the mixed biexcitons with filled electronic @xmath100-shell and found hole - mn exchange - induced rabi oscillations of the biexcitonic populations for any location of the mn atom on the @xmath2-axis .",
