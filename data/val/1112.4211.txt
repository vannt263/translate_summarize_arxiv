    "the resulting large number of pne now known in the central lmc ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "our access to the mcels survey ( ( * ? ? ? * smith et al . 1998 ) ) provides the opportunity to achieve equivalent results across a much larger 84deg@xmath0 of the lmc , critical for a complete determination of kinematics , abundance gradients and central star properties ( eg . (",

    "the confirmation of the previously known and faint new pne candidates in the outer lmc to v=21 will provide the most accurate pnlf across a whole galaxy ever achieved .",
    "relatively few faint pne have been observed in previous surveys and the faintest three magnitudes of the lmc pnlf were very poorly determined .",

    "a pnlf across a whole galaxy can accurately predict the number of stars in the pn evolutionary stage and in each luminosity bin compared to the luminosity and mass of the whole galaxy .",
    "this is not feasibly attainable for any galaxy other than the lmc and smc , as dust obscures too much of our own galaxy and other galaxies are too distant to identify faint pne .",
