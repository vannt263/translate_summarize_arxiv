    "many kinds of molecular motors are known to play essential roles of life .",
    "the word molecular motor is , in a wide sense , used to describe protein molecules that transduce chemical energy from some source into mechanical work ( and in some case , vice versa ) .",
    "molecular motors are classified into two kinds : linear and rotatory motors . as the former , myosins , kinesins , and dyneins ,",
    "which slide along the specific filaments in the specific direction , respectively , are known to work for muscle construction , transport of materials in cell , _ etc_. by hydrolysing atp@xcite . as the latter , two motors are known to date .",
    "the one is bacteria flagellar motor , which works as a propeller by gaining chemical energy from the proton gradient across the membrane .",
    "the other is atp synthase which is found in membranes of living things .",
    "it works wholly as a transducer between the energy of proton gradient across the membrane and that of atp synthesis from adp and inorganic phosphate .",
    "it can both synthesize atp and pump proton against the proton gradient by hydrolysing atp ( see fig.16 - 28 in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it is composed of two parts , the @xmath0- and the @xmath1-part , each is known to work as a rotatory motor @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-part is embedded in the membrane .",
    "it contains a proton channel and transduces the energy of transmembrane proton gradient into rotatory torque when working as synthesizer .",
    "the @xmath1- part plays a role of atp synthesis / hydrolysis , transducing rotatory torque into the energy required for atp synthesis and vice versa .",
    "it is believed generally that the energy transduction efficiency of molecular motor , that is , the ratio of the energy output to input from the energy source , is extremely high .",
    "for example , it is reported in ref.@xcite that the efficiency is almost 100 percent for the @xmath1-part of atp synthase .",
    "thus , understanding the mechanism of molecular motors , especially that of energy transduction is important not only because of their many roles of life , but also because of the possibility that , if this mechanism is novel , it may be applied to a new technology as a machine with high energy transduction efficiency , even if it can be used only in a constrained scale . in the scale of motor molecule(@xmath210 - 100 nm ) , water molecules collides motor molecule so many times .",
    "these collisions make the diffusive motion of the motor molecule and thus it is natural to infer that this collision effect contributes to the motion of motor , but there is no crucial evidence that it is essential .    here",
    "we take up a simple model inspired by the @xmath0-part of atp synthase@xcite and examine the dependence of the rotation velocity and the proton translocation rate of this model on the chemical reaction rates .",
    "the efficiency of energy transduction is calculated from these quantities .",
    "as far as we know , there is no computation of this kind .",
    "the @xmath0-part is schematically drawn in figs.[over ] and [ front ] .",
    "it contains three types of subunits , * a * , * b * , and * c*. as shown in fig.[over ] , the * a*-subunit is fixed in the membrane .",
    "the * b*-subunit connects the @xmath0- and @xmath1-part but is not shown in figs.[over ] and [ front](see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the * c*-subunits are arranged in a ring and this ring rotates accompanying the proton translocation .",
    "there is a proton binding site in the almost middle of each * c*- subunit , asp61 , a carboxyrate .",
    "a proton passes through the interface between the * a*- and * c*- subunits ( but as described later , not directly ) , called proton channel . in the proton channel , there are two paths to these binding sites , the left one is from the basic side , the inner side of the membrane , and the right is from the acidic side , the outer(see fig.[front])@xcite .",
    "proton concentration in the acidic side are kept higher than that of the basic side by respiratory chains , which pumps protons in the basic side out of the membrane . roughly speaking ,",
    "a proton flows into and binds to the right site from acidic side , goes through the membrane with * c*-ring rotation , and dissociates from the left site and flows out to the basic side .",
    "that is , a proton passes through the proton channel not directly but via the membrane accompanying the rotation of the * c*-ring .",
    "is defined as a rotation angle of the ring.[over],width=264 ]    -part.[front],width=264 ]    we investigate the above situation using the (simply ) biased diffusion model @xcite .",
    "it was first presented to explain the rotation of bacteria flagellar motor which has similar structure to the @xmath0-part of the atp synthase but is one order larger in linear dimension .",
    "the mechanism is as follows : there are @xmath3 proton binding sites in the rotor ( i.e. the ring is composed of @xmath3 * c*-subunits and @xmath3=9 - 12 in _ escherichia coli _ ) at same intervals and two of them are in the proton channel .",
    "only two proton binding sites are allowed to be in the channel and each of them can be protonated or unprotonated .",
    "the others can be only protonated due to the hydrophobicity of the membrane .",
    "thus the states of the motor are determined by the protonation of the two proton binding sites in the channel : e is the empty state where both sites are unprotonated , r is the right state where the right site is protonated and the left is unprotonated , l is the left state where the left site is protonated and the right is unprotonated , and f is the full state where both sites are protonated .",
    "we assume that a proton does not hop between two proton binding sites .",
    "when one of the proton binding sites in the channel comes to the boundary , it can move into the membrane only if it is protonated and otherwise can not due to hydrophobicity of the membrane . if there is difference from detailed balance between the rates of one site at which a proton binds to or dissociates from it and those of the other due to the transmembrane proton gradient , it become possible to take out a net motion .",
    "dynamics of each state is described by the langevin equation , @xmath4 where @xmath5 refers to the state , @xmath6 is the friction constant , @xmath7 is the position of the motor ( see fig.1 ) which is explicitly defined later .",
    "the potential @xmath8 represents the load torque @xmath9 from the @xmath1 part , so @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "@xmath11 is the random force of gaussian noise , which satisfies @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the time average and @xmath15 is the diffusion constant satisfying the einstein s relation , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 : temperature , @xmath18 : the boltzmann constant ) .",
    "the constants @xmath15 and @xmath6 depend on the states since the different conformations have different surface areas , densities , _",
    "etc_. but for simplicity , it is assumed below that all the states have effectively the same values , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , since those differences are small .",
    "in addition to the above single - state motions , transitions between different states occur . thus it is convenient to adopt the formulation of the fokker - planck equation equivalent to eq.([laneq ] ) , @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the external force @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "@xmath25 is the transition matrix which describes changes between states .",
    "the system discussed here has 4-component probability @xmath26 and flow @xmath27 @xmath28 , \\quad   { \\bf{\\pi}}(x , t)=\\left [ \\begin{array}{c } \\pi_{\\rm e}(x , t)\\\\ \\pi_{\\rm r}(x , t)\\\\ \\pi_{\\rm l}(x , t ) \\\\",

    "the coordinate @xmath7 is placed as follows : the origin @xmath32 is set at the center of the * c*-ring and the position variable @xmath7 is defined as a rotation angle ( fig.[over ] ) .",
    "the proton channel extends from @xmath33 to @xmath34 ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 fixed hereafter ) .",
    "the position @xmath33 is defined that the left proton binding site is at the left boundary of the channel , and @xmath37 is that the right site is at the right boundary .",
    "when one site moves into the membrane , another site appears into the channel from the other side of the membrane . in this sense",
    ", the system has periodicity . these constraints of periodicity and hydrophobicity mentioned above are expressed by giving eq.([fpeeq ] ) the boundary conditions , @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 and , @xmath41    the transition rate matrix is written as @xmath42.\\ ] ] there are a few assumptions in the above expression of the transition rate matrix : 1 ) the chemical reaction , that is , binding and/or dissociation of proton to / from the sites , is sufficiently fast compared with the motion of the motor protein .",
    "this is justified because the mass and size of a proton is much smaller than those of the motor so the diffusion coefficient of a proton is much larger than that of the motor protein .",
    "2 ) there is no correlation between the reaction of the left site and that of the right site .",
    "3 ) the reaction rates are independent of the position of the motor @xmath7 .",
    "this assumption may have to be modified to take account of other influences , for instance , interaction between residues@xcite .",
    "but we neglect the influences like these for simplicity . in this case , for example , it is thought that @xmath43 , the rate at which state e switches to state r and @xmath44 , the one at which l switches to f are both written by @xmath45 , the one at which a proton binds to the empty right site .",
    "so similarly we set , @xmath46 and , @xmath47 for the motor to work , the detailed balance should be violated due to the free energy acquired from a proton passage of the channel , @xmath48 .",

    "<S> we give a natural explanation that this behavior is universal when certain inequalities between chemical reaction rates hold . that may give a clue to examine whether the motion of the molecular motor is dominated by diffusion process or not . </S>"
