    "in completely open quantum systems the fractal weyl law @xcite states that the number of long - lived resonances scales with the planck constant as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the fractal dimension of the classical repeller .",

    "we find the classical invariant distribution consisting of all the trajectories that do not escape either in the past or in the future : the repeller .",
    "it plays a fundamental role in the determination of the quantum spectral features .",
    "however , a finite reflectivity @xmath0 is required to describe many experimental situations , as it is the case in optical cavities @xcite for example .",
    "this means that the classical trajectories arriving to the opening are partially reflected .",
    "this leads to partially open systems which can be very well represented with partially open maps . in these cases we have",
    "that the fractal dimension is the phase space dimension , but the fractal character remains through the multifractal measures @xcite . in a very recent work @xcite the case of the partially open tribaker map has been analyzed .",
    "it was found that the number of long - lived resonances follows a non trivial scaling that is related to the quantum undersampling of the classical phase space .    on the other hand ,",
    "the semiclassical theory of short periodic orbits ( pos ) has been successfully applied to a number of problems including closed quantum chaotic systems , scarring phenomena and more recently to open quantum maps @xcite . in this approach",
    "the main ingredients are the shortest pos contained in the repeller , they provide all the necessary information to construct a basis set of scar functions in which the quantum non unitary operators can be written . the number of trajectories needed to reproduce the quantum repeller @xcite",
    "is related to the fractal weyl law @xcite .    in this work",
    "we extend the short pos theory to partially open quantum maps where a fraction of the quantum probability is reflected .",
    "we apply it to the partially open tribaker map . for this purpose",
    "we modify the definition of the scar functions and define the way in which the trajectories inside and outside of the repeller at @xmath1 are taken into account .",
    "we find that there are several regimes as a function of the reflectivity .",
    "first of all , a perturbative one in which by just considering the shortest pos inside the repeller at @xmath1 the long - lived resonances and the quantum distribution associated to the invariant classical measure can be obtained . by suitably incorporating the shortest pos outside of this set",
    "we are able to extend the validity of the semiclassical calculations well beyond this perturbative regime . in doing",
    "so we keep some of its efficiency in terms of reducing the dimension of the hilbert space needed for the calculations .",
    "finally we find that a transition from an open - like to a closed - like behavior takes place and this is clearly characterized by its effect on the semiclassical calculations .",
    "this paper adopts the following organization : in sec .",
    "[ sec : popenmaps ] we define the classical and quantum partially open tribaker maps and all the relevant quantities associated to them . in sec . [ sec : shortpoth2pomaps ] we extend the short po theory to this kind of systems . in sec .",

    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ]",
    "the study of maps , which constitute simple examples exhibiting a rich dynamics , has a long and fruitful history in the classical and quantum chaos literature @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "open maps on the 2-torus are transformations which represent the evolution of trajectories that disappear when they reach an open region in the bidimensional phase - space .",
    "an invariant set is formed by the remaining trajectories , i.e. those that do not escape either in the past or in the future .",
    "these trajectories build the forward and backwards trapped sets respectively , and the intersection of both is what is called the repeller , which has a fractal dimension .    partially open maps can be defined as those maps in which the opening does not absorb all the trajectories that arrive at it , but reflects back a certain amount . this amount is essentially given by the reflectivity @xmath4 . here",
    ", we exclude @xmath1 since this corresponds to completely open maps , and @xmath5 since it represents a closed one .",
    "this is the simplest choice of the reflection mechanism . in general",
    "one considers a function of the phase space points , @xmath6 in bidimensional examples .",
    "nevertheless our simple model captures the main features of realistic systems of interest such as microcavities @xcite .",
    "in contrast to what happens in an open map , in partially open ones the relevant measure is not uniformly distributed on a fractal , showing multifractality instead .",
    "we closely follow the definition found in @xcite . in each phase space region",
    "@xmath7 this measure depends on the average intensity @xmath8 with @xmath9 of random initial conditions taken in @xmath7 .",
    "these intensities are defined as @xmath10 with @xmath11 for each trajectory .",
    "the finite time measure of @xmath7 can be defined as @xmath12 where the average is over the initial conditions in the given phase space region .",
    "in fact , this measure is the analogue of the backwards trapped set of open maps .",
    "if we evolve backwards we obtain @xmath13 the analogue of the forward trapped set , and the intersection gives what we call the _ partial repeller _ @xmath14 .",
    "the usual quantization scheme for maps on the torus proceeds in the following way : in the first place we impose boundary conditions for both the position and momentum representations by taking @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , with @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "thus the hilbert space is of finite dimension @xmath19 , and the semiclassical limit corresponds to @xmath20 .",
    "the system s propagator is given by a @xmath21 matrix .",
    "position and momentum eigenstates are given by @xmath22 and @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "a discrete fourier transform gives @xmath25 .",
    "when @xmath1 the opening can be easily quantized as a projection operator @xmath26 on its complement .",
    "we usually take a finite strip parallel to the @xmath27 axis , so if @xmath28 is the propagator for the closed system , then @xmath29 stands for the open one . here",
    "we take a partial opening so we modify this projector by replacing the zero block of the opening by @xmath30 , where the identity has the dimension associated to the escape region .",
    "the resulting partially open quantum map has @xmath31 right eigenvectors @xmath32 and @xmath31 left ones @xmath33 , which are mutually orthogonal @xmath34 , and that are associated to resonances @xmath35 .",
    "we choose @xmath36 for the norm .",
    "we make all the calculations of this work on the tribaker map , whose classical expression is given by @xmath37 this is an area - preserving , uniformly hyperbolic , piecewise - linear and invertible map with lyapunov exponent @xmath38 .",
    "an opening has been placed in the region @xmath39 , where the reflectivity is given by @xmath0 as explained above .",
    "the quantum version of the tribaker map is defined by means of the discrete fourier transform in position representation as @xcite @xmath40 taking antiperiodic boundary conditions , this meaning @xmath41 . the partially open quantum tribaker map is then given by means of the operator @xmath42 applied to eq .",

    "we take @xmath1 for comparison purposes .",
    "next , in the upper right panel we display the @xmath45 case which is almost indistinguishable from the completely open one , this suggests that there should be a perturbative regime at least up to these reflectivity values . in the lower left panel",
    "we represent the case @xmath46 , where it is clear that the measure starts to be non negligible outside the repeller ( @xmath1 ) .",

    "following the ideas of the short pos theory for closed systems @xcite , we have recently developed a similar theory of short pos for open quantum maps @xcite . in this theory",
    "the repeller has a central role and the short pos that belong to it provide all the essential information needed to recover the quantum long - lived eigenvalues and the quantum repeller ( with some exceptions @xcite ) .",
    "the fundamental tools in this approach are the open scar functions associated to each one of these trajectories . to make the paper self - contained",
    ", we make a brief description of the partially open scar function construction , which is a very natural adaptation to the case of partially open maps .",
    "let @xmath48 be a po of fundamental period @xmath49 that belongs to a partially open map .",
    "we can define coherent states @xmath50 associated to each point of the orbit ( it has a total of @xmath49 points , all in the partial repeller ) .",
    "we then construct a linear combination with them : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in this expression @xmath54",
    "is the action acquired by the @xmath55th coherent state in one step of the map .",
    "the total action is @xmath56 and @xmath57 . finally , the right and left scar functions for the periodic orbit are defined through the propagation of these linear combinations under the partially open map @xmath58 ( up to approximately the system s ehrenfest time @xmath59 ) . @xmath60 and @xmath61 normalization ( @xmath62 )",
    "is chosen in such a way that @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "these functions are suitable tools for the investigation of the morphology of the eigenstates .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we illustrate the partially open scar functions by means of a representation @xcite that clearly shows the quantum probability that can be associated to the classical partial repeller .",
    "we define the symmetrical operator @xmath65 related to the right @xmath66 and left @xmath67 states ( in this case scar functions , where we have collapsed both subscripts to just one for simplicity ) @xmath68 which is associated to the orbit @xmath48 . by calculating the sum over all these projectors @xcite corresponding to the sets of scar functions used for a given semiclassical calculation we can see how different parts of the phase space are represented in the basis . in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show these sums for @xmath46 , while in the lower ones for @xmath47 . on the left column",
    "we find open scar functions associated to short pos living inside the repeller , and outside of it on the right column .",

    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "it can be noticed that the contribution from the orbits that are outside of the repeller increases with @xmath0 .     over the partially open scar functions .",
    "upper panels correspond to @xmath46 and lower ones to @xmath47 . on the left column",
    "we show the scar functions set associated to orbits @xmath48 inside the repeller at @xmath1 , on the right one the set associated to orbits outside of it.,width=302 ]    as a matter of fact , we come now to the other important point in adapting the theory to the partially open case : how to select the orbits that take part in the calculation ? for this purpose we choose the following criterion : select a given number of pos , @xmath69 , from the whole set up to a period @xmath49 , that approximately covers the partial repeller .",
    "the selected degree in the approximation of this covering translates into the fraction of long - lived resonances that can be obtained . in practical terms",
    "this means allowing all pos up to period @xmath49 that are inside the repeller into a first list , since they have a uniform weight .",
    "those that are outside must have the greatest values of @xmath70 .",
    "we select them by fixing the maximum number allowed @xmath71 ( again , from all of them up to period @xmath49 ) , which establishes a @xmath70 cutoff value from the list of these orbits ordered by decreasing weight .",
    "@xmath71 is established having in mind that it should increase with @xmath0 , starting from zero at @xmath1 .",
    "for that purpose @xmath71 grows with the reflectivity ( note that this also depends on the particular map considered ) .",
    "hence , the preliminary list of all the orbits incorporates them by increasing value of their period and contains the ones with the largest weights .",
    "we notice that the number of orbits in this list is typically much larger than the number needed for our approximation . as a next step ,",
    "we optimize the set by a reordering to provide with the most uniform covering possible of the partial repeller .",
    "we finish the selection by cutting the list at @xmath69 .",
    "finally , we construct an appropriate basis in which we can write the partially open evolution operators associated to partially open maps as @xmath72 . this expression is the short pos approximation to the partially open propagator @xmath58 on the partial repeller . equipped with @xmath73 , we solve a generalized eigenvalue problem that provides the eigenstates of this matrix .",
    "the long - lived resonances @xcite are constructed by a linear combination of the eigenvector s coefficients and the corresponding scar functions of the basis .",
    "we use the short pos theory to construct a semiclassical approximation of the partially open quantum tribaker map in the @xmath74 case , for several values of @xmath0 , considering pos up to period @xmath75 . in order to quantify the behaviour of the short pos method we define its performance @xmath26 @xcite as the fraction of long - lived eigenvalues that it is able to reproduce within an error given by @xmath76 , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the exact eigenvalues and those given by the semiclassical theory , respectively .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the number of exact eigenvalues with modulus greater than @xmath79 , which is a critical value that depends on @xmath0 . in our calculations",
    "we have tried to keep the number constant at around @xmath80 since for low values of @xmath0 this represents the outer ring of eigenvalues that is a typical feature of the open quantum baker maps .",
    "this is very useful since it provides with a natural separation between short and long - lived resonances .",
    "we calculate the number of scar functions @xmath81 as a fraction of @xmath31 that are needed in order to obtain as many semiclassical eigenvalues inside the @xmath82 vicinity of the corresponding exact ones in order to reach @xmath83 .",
    "the fraction @xmath84 is a good indicator of the efficiency of the method .",
    "in fact , one of its main advantages is reducing the effective dimension of the matrices that one needs to diagonalize in order to obtain the resonances of the quantum system .",
    "but it also reveals if there are quantum signatures of ( multi)fractal dimensions when partially opening the map ( like the fractal weyl law ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that all the threshold values considered guarantee a reasonably good performance of the approximation and the evaluation of a meaningful number of eigenvalues in the whole range of situations that we have studied .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the fraction @xmath84 needed to reach @xmath83 as a function of @xmath85 $ ] for three different scenarios derived from our pos selection criterion .",
    "the line with squares correspond to the case in which we only take pos that belong to the repeller .",
    "we have also considered @xmath86 ( pos outside of it ) , results which are represented by means of a line with circles .",
    "finally the case with @xmath87 is shown through a line with up triangles .",
    "we point out that there is no improvement in the calculations when considering more pos outside the repeller .     needed to reach @xmath88 as a function of the reflectivity @xmath0 .",
    "the green ( gray ) line with squares corresponds to the case where only pos inside the repeller have been considered .",
    "blue ( black ) and cyan ( light gray ) lines with circles and up triangles correspond to considering @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "the inset shows the behaviour for greater @xmath0 values .",
    ", width=302 ]    the results in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] clearly show that the behaviour of the short pos theory for the partially open tribaker map can be divided into four regimes .",
    "first we notice that there is a perturbative regime in which the open scar functions associated to the pos inside the repeller at @xmath1 are the only ones needed in order to accurately reproduce the long - lived resonances .",
    "this regime extends up to approximately @xmath45 .",
    "it is also clear that by incorporating up to @xmath89 pos outside the repeller with the greatest @xmath70 values the performance is worse .",
    "this amount represents around @xmath90 of the available pos up to period @xmath75 .",
    "moreover , if we include up to @xmath91 of these pos the result is much worse ( a significant amount of the pos inside the repeller are now replaced by them ) . beyond @xmath45",
    "the pos in the repeller are still enough to reproduce the long - lived resonances , but the overall amount of scar functions needed steadily increases up to @xmath46 , though at a slower pace than before .",
    "in fact , for @xmath92 $ ] we identify a semi - perturbative regime , in the sense that the classical information of the repeller is still enough but becomes less efficient . above @xmath46",
    "the repeller is not enough to adequately treat the problem and other pos outside of it are needed . from this value of @xmath0 on",
    ", we also see that by incorporating a greater amount of pos not living inside the repeller , we obtain a similar performance of the method .",
    "this so to say proper partially open regime extends up to @xmath93 approximately . beyond",
    "that we find the fourth and last regime , as can be seen in the inset of fig .",
    "here , a saturation occurs and we need @xmath94 , leaving our method with no advantage with respect to a direct diagonalization .",
    "this is a clear sign that the system has become effectively closed from our perspective , i.e. we need to expand all the phase space no matter the local value of the measure @xmath70 .",
    "we have verified that in the case @xmath95 , @xmath96 for @xmath45 obtained with all the pos inside the repeller , and @xmath97 for @xmath98 with pos mainly outside of it .",
    "this is in agreement with the previous results , though we leave the study of this scaling for future work .    to illustrate this behaviour we use the projectors @xmath65 of sec .",
    "[ sec : shortpoth2pomaps ] now associated to the right @xmath32 and left @xmath99 eigenstates , which are related to the eigenvalue @xmath35 .",
    "we calculate the sum of the first @xmath100 of these projectors @xcite , ordered by decreasing modulus of the corresponding eigenvalues ( @xmath101 with @xmath102 ) up to completing the set of long - lived resonances .",
    "@xmath103 their phase space representation by means of coherent states @xmath104 is given by @xmath105 this is our formal definition of the _ partial quantum repeller _ , which we call @xmath106 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show @xmath106 for the exact resonances on the left column , and the ones given by the short pos approach , i.e. @xmath107 , on the right one . in the upper panels the case @xmath46 has been obtained by just using the pos that live in the repeller .",
    "this shows that the pos inside the repeller are enough to reproduce the partial quantum repeller ; little probability is found outside of it . in the lower panel",
    "we display the @xmath47 case where the contribution from the orbits outside of the repeller is crucial , as can be noticed from the greater non - zero probability found in other regions of phase space .",
    "for the exact resonances ( left column ) , and @xmath107 for the short pos theory results ( right column ) , for @xmath46 ( top ) and @xmath47 ( bottom).,width=302 ]    the overlap of the normalized distributions , calculated as @xmath108 , is @xmath109 for @xmath46 and @xmath110 for @xmath47 , confirming the excellent agreement between the exact and the semiclassical results .",
    "we have extended the short pos theory to partially open quantum maps and have applied it to the particular case of the partially open tribaker map .",
    "it turns out that for low reflectivities , the long - lived resonances and the partial quantum repeller can be reproduced up to a very good accuracy with just the classical information of the repeller ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "moreover , we identify four different regimes in which the role played by the orbits that live inside and outside of the repeller changes .",
    "they are the perturbative , semi - perturbative , proper partially open , and the effectively closed regimes .",
    "this translates directly into the partial quantum repeller , which performs a non - trivial transition from an open - like to a closed - like shape as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "one of the main features of our theory when applied to open maps is that the size of the matrices needed in the final diagonalization is greatly reduced .",
    "this is due to the fact that the number of necessary scar functions scales according with the fractal weyl law @xcite . in the case of the partially open tribaker map we have found that for @xmath111 ( perturbative regime ) the reduction in the calculation effort is very important",
    "this advantage is gradually lost as the reflectivity @xmath0 increases .",
    "this is in agreement with the behaviour already found in previous publications @xcite where the multifractal nature of these classical systems has been shown to influence the spectral properties of their quantum counterparts .",
    "this reveals the importance that all the probability distributed in each region of phase space has in this kind of maps ( despite we have selected the orbits in terms of their weights expressed by @xmath70 ) .",
    "moreover , from the semiclassical point of view all the pos are progressively more interconnected as a function of @xmath0 , and each detail of them becomes more and more relevant for a precise diagonalization .    finally , the partially open scar function is a very interesting tool for the study of the morphology of the eigenstates .",
    "in fact , we think that our semiclassical theory can significantly contribute and provides a new perspective for the study of emission problems in microcavities .",
