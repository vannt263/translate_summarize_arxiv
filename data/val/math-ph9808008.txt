    "inverse scattering problems , originally introduced for potential scattering in quantum physics ( see for instance ref.@xcite and the references therein ) , have found their applications in a wide variety of scientific and technological fields .",
    "an important limitation to the application of inverse scattering methods to real data is related to the inherently unstable behavior of the algorithms involved @xcite .",
    "we present in this paper a novel method to solve the one - dimensional inverse scattering problem , and moreover a discussion about the stability of the obtained solutions is given .",
    "the inverse problem for the one - dimensional schrdinger equation can be solved by using the marchenko equation .",
    "burridge showed that the inverse problem of the one - dimensional wave equation can be transformed into an quantum inverse scattering representation @xcite .",
    "this result made it possible to solve electro - magnetic , optical and acoustic inverse problems by using the marchenko equation .",
    "the marchenko equation maps a reflection time series , ( hereafter to be referred to as the `` data - set '' ) , onto an integral kernel from which the quantum mechanical potential function can be recovered .",
    "the data - set is the fourier transform of the reflection coefficient .",
    "sabatier has discovered a method to solve this integral kernel in the fourier domain for reflection coefficients that are a rational function of the wave number @xcite .    in ref.@xcite stability estimates",
    "are made for the solutions derived by sabatier .",
    "a disadvantage of the method presented in ref.@xcite is that the method is highly dimensional and therefore not easily implementable for realistic data - sets . in this paper",
    "we re - open the discussion with respect to the solvability and stability of one - dimensional marchenko - equation on the basis of novel results which have recently become available in the field of the integrability of nonlinear evolution equations @xcite .",
    "it is shown in these publications that large classes of solutions of integrable nonlinear evolution equations can be obtained by solving the fourier expansion coefficients of its solution by using a recursion relationship .",
    "since it is well known that large classes of nonlinear evolution equations are integrable by inverse scattering transformations , it is worth investigating whether the machinery developed in ref.@xcite can also be applied in solving quantum inverse scattering problems .",
    "we show in this paper that it is possible to transform the gelfand - levitan - marchenko equation into a linear recursion relationship which determines the fourier expansion coefficients of the kernel .",
    "this result made it also possible to investigate the stability of the solutions by using lyapunov exponents which can be computed from the data - uncertainties .",
    "this implies that we have a simple tool which requires only information about the data and data - uncertainties , to investigate whether the marchenko equation is stable . secondly ,",
    "if we might conclude that the inverse scattering problem is unstable , we provide machinery to extract the largest sub - set from the scattering data which leads to a stable solution .",
    "this paper has the following structure : in section 2 we focus on the linearization method which leads to the relationship between the expansion coefficients of the data and the expansion coefficients of the kernel .",
    "we firstly investigate the principle for a data - set having one fourier component only , but the method is generalized to data - sets having a arbitrary ( but finite ) number of fourier components . in section 3 , we investigate the stability of the obtained solutions by using lyapunov exponents . a simple numerical example is given .",
    "the paper is concluded with a discussion .",
    "in this paper , solutions of the quantum inverse scattering problem are discussed .",
    "the quantum inverse scattering problem is the inverse problem of the schrdinger equation which is given by : @xmath0 for reasons of simplicity the following restrictions on the scattering solutions are imposed .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath1 , and secondly , only incoming waves from the left are taken into account .",
    "the solutions of the schrdinger equation ( [ eq : schrod.2 ] ) satisfy : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the transmission coefficient , and @xmath4 is the reflection coefficient from the left . in the following",
    ", the data - set is defined by the function @xmath5 .",
    "the relation between the data - set @xmath5 and the spectral reflection coefficient @xmath4 of the schrdinger equation is given by : @xmath6 the inverse problem for the schrdinger equation can be solved using the marchenko equation : @xmath7 the potential is recovered from the integral kernel @xmath8 by @xcite : @xmath9 in this paper , we firstly discus a method to obtain solutions of the marchenko - equation .",
    "the method is based upon results developed in ref.@xcite . as a starting point , we assume that the data @xmath10 can be expanded in a fourier series : @xmath11 by considering a data - set which can be expressed in the form as presented in eq.([datfour ] ) , we have implicitly assumed that the reflection coefficient is a rational function of the wave - number .",
    "this is not a limitation for the application to real data , since a measured data - set can be approximated sufficiently by considering a series of the form ( [ datfour ] ) for which @xmath12 . as a first step",
    ", we consider the most simple case in which the data - set @xmath10 has only one fourier component : @xmath13 in this special case , we propose a kernel @xmath8 having the following structure : @xmath14 if the expressions ( [ series_dat ] ) and ( [ series_mod ] ) are substituted in eq.([eq : mar.2 ] ) , we obtain the following result : @xmath15 if we assume that @xmath16 is a complex number with positive imaginary part , the integral in eq.([mar_1 ] ) can be replaced by the primitive of an exponential function : @xmath17 we can solve eq.([mar_2 ] ) by comparing the exponential functions of equal powers on both sides .",
    "this is done by firstly defining a number @xmath18 , and hence by comparing all the exponential functions for which @xmath19 respectively .",
    "if we use the fact that the coefficients @xmath20 and @xmath16 are determined by the data - spectrum , the kernel @xmath8 can be computed by collecting all the coefficients @xmath21 . from the @xmath22-dependence on the right - hand side of eq.([mar_2 ] ) , we can immediately conclude that all the coefficients @xmath21 vanish for which @xmath23 .",
    "we consider firstly the case that @xmath24 : @xmath25 this leads to the result that @xmath26 .",
    "if we put @xmath27 , it can easily be verified by substitution that both the coefficients @xmath28 and @xmath29 vanish . in general ,",
    "only coefficients @xmath21 for which @xmath30 are unequal to zero and follow from the following recursion relationship : @xmath31 by using eq.([rec_1 ] ) , we can compute the kernel @xmath32 as a function of @xmath20 and @xmath16 : @xmath33 the potential function @xmath34 can be recovered from the kernel @xmath8 by using the relationship ( [ eq : v.2 ] ) .",
    "if we substitute @xmath35 and @xmath36 into eq.([kern_2 ] ) , we obtain the following expression for @xmath37 : @xmath38 the solution of the kernel ( [ k_xx2 ] ) is in agreement with solutions obtained by using sabatiers approach @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the method presented in this paper is that we solve the inverse scattering problem by deriving a linear recursion relationship between the fourier expansion coefficients of the data and the expansion coefficients of the kernel .",
    "this implies that we have discovered a method which is easy to implement from a computational point of view , and moreover , the stability of the obtained solutions can be investigated by using lyapunov exponents .    in order to generalize this method to the data - set ( [ series_dat ] )",
    ", it is also illustrating to discus a data - set consisting of two fourier components : @xmath39 in this special case we propose a kernel @xmath8 having the following structure : @xmath40 if we insert eq.([data_3 ] ) and eq.([kern_3 ] ) in the marchenko equation , we obtain the following result : @xmath41 k_{1 } + s k_{2 } ) } e^{i(p+q+1)k_{1}x } e^{i(r+s)k_{2}x } e^{i k_{1 } y } \\right . \\\\ & + \\left . \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\sum_{p , q , r , s=0}^{\\infty }   \\ ! \\ !   \\frac { a_{2 } b(p , q , r , s ) } { i ( [ s+1 ] k_{2 } + q k_{1 } ) } e^{i(p+q)k_{1}x } e^{i(r+s+1)k_{2}x } e^{i k_{2 } y } \\right ] \\end{split } \\label{march_3}\\ ] ] if we use the fact that the coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 are determined by the data , we can compute the non - zero coefficients @xmath44 .",
    "this is done , by firstly defining @xmath45 and comparing the exponential functions for which @xmath46 respectively .",
    "if we consider the case that @xmath24 , we obtain the following result : @xmath47 from eq.([step_3 ] ) , we obtain that @xmath48 and that @xmath49 . in general ,",
    "it follows from eq.([march_3 ] ) that all the expansion coefficients @xmath44 can be computed by solving the following linear iteration relationship : @xmath50k_{1 } + s k_{2 } ) }   \\\\",
    "b(p+q,0,r+s+1,1 ) & =   a_{2 } \\frac{b(p , q , r , s ) } { i([s+1]k_{2 } + q k_{1 } ) } \\end{split } \\label{it_ser}\\ ] ] it can be witnessed from eq.([it_ser ] ) that the number of expansion coefficients double after each iteration . as an example , we compute the coefficients arising from the first three iterations : @xmath51 it can be witnessed from eq.([bla ] ) , that some of the coefficients @xmath44 occur more than once .",
    "since these coefficients all belong to the same exponential basis function , we can simply add them together .",
    "similarly as for the case that the data - spectrum has only one fourier component , we have a iteration relationship to solve the coefficients @xmath44 .",
    "if we collect all the coefficients @xmath44 , we find that the kernel @xmath8 is given by the following relationship : @xmath52 this result can be made general by considering the full data - set @xmath10 as presented in eq.([datfour ] ) . in this case",
    "we propose a kernel @xmath8 having the following structure : @xmath53 if we substitute eq.([kern_gen ] ) and eq.([datfour ] ) into the marchenko equation we obtain the following expression : @xmath54 k_{1 } + \\hat{n}_{2 } k_{2 }   + \\cdots \\hat{n}_{n } k_{n } ) } e^ { i ( n_{1 } + \\hat{n}_{1 } + 1 ) k_{1 } x } e^ { i ( n_{2 } + \\hat{n}_{2 } ) k_{2 } x } \\cdots e^ { i ( n_{n } + \\hat{n}_{n } ) k_{n } x } e^{ik_{1 } y } \\right .",

    "\\frac { a_{n } b(n_{1},\\hat{n}_{1 } \\cdots n_{n},\\hat{n}_{n } ) } { i ( \\hat{n}_{1 } k_{1 } + \\hat{n}_{2 } k_{2 }   + \\cdots [ \\hat{n}_{n } + 1 ] k_{n } ) } e^ { i ( n_{1 } + \\hat{n}_{1 } ) k_{1 } x } e^ { i ( n_{2 } + \\hat{n}_{2 } ) k_{2 } x } \\cdots e^ { i ( n_{n } + \\hat{n}_{n } + 1 ) k_{n } x } e^{ik_{n } y } \\right ] \\end{split}\\ ] ] from this result , we can immediately derive that : @xmath55 moreover , we can derive by using a similar argumentation as used in the case that @xmath56 that the recursion relations are given by : @xmath57 k_{1 } + \\hat{n}_{2 } k_{2 } + \\cdots \\hat{n}_{n } k_{n } ) }     \\\\",
    "b(n_{1}+\\hat{n}_{1},0,n_{2}+\\hat{n}_{2}+1,1 , \\cdots , n_{n}+\\hat{n}_{n},0 ) & =   a_{2 } \\frac { b(n_{1},\\hat{n}_{1},n_{2},\\hat{n}_{2 } , \\cdots , n_{n},\\hat{n}_{n } )   } {   i ( \\hat{n}_{1 } k_{1 } + [ \\hat{n}_{2 } + 1 ] k_{2 } + \\cdots \\hat{n}_{n } k_{n } ) }     \\\\ & \\vdots \\\\ b(n_{1}+\\hat{n}_{1},0,n_{2}+\\hat{n}_{2},0 , \\cdots , n_{n}+\\hat{n}_{n}+1,1 ) & =   a_{n } \\frac { b(n_{1},\\hat{n}_{1},n_{2},\\hat{n}_{2 } , \\cdots , n_{n},\\hat{n}_{n } )   } {   i(\\hat{n}_{1 }   k_{1 } + \\hat{n}_{2 } k_{2 } + \\cdots [ \\hat{n}_{n } + 1 ] k_{n } ) }     \\\\ \\end{split } \\label{it_fin}\\ ] ] once the coefficients @xmath58 are determined , the kernel @xmath8 can be uniquely recovered .",
    "hence the kernel @xmath8 can be represented in the following form : @xmath59 the final result which is presented by eq.([ker_fin ] ) is in agreement with results obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "the method used for deriving eq.([ker_fin ] ) enables us to investigate the sensitivity of the method for small data - errors by using lyapunov exponents .",
    "before we proceed , we place a few remarks .",
    "firstly , it is interesting that large classes of solutions of the marchenko equation can be obtained by solving a linear recursion relationship .",
    "the instabilities in the obtained solutions can be explained by the process of repeated iteration which has to be applied to compute the full kernel .",
    "this also implies that the stability of the obtained solutions depends strongly on the the numerical value of the parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the second remark is that from a conceptual point of view there is no difference in solving inverse scattering problems or solving nonlinear evolution equations @xcite .",
    "it is shown this publication that both integrable nonlinear evolution equations can be linearized using a similar approach as used in this paper .",
    "this explains why the inverse scattering method works so well in the field of integrability .",
    "in the previous section solutions of the marchenko equation are discussed .",
    "we have shown that we can compute solutions of the marchenko equation by solving the linear recursion relation ( [ it_fin ] ) .",
    "solutions of the marchenko equation can be unstable due to process of repeated iteration which is used to compute the expansion coefficients of the obtained solutions .",
    "the fact that the marchenko equation can be solved by using a recursion relationship enables us to perform the stability analysis of the inverse scattering problem by using lyapunov exponents . at a first sight the bookkeeping for the process of error propagation of the coefficients",
    "@xmath58 is quite tedious , but the analysis can be simplified by considering only the coefficients which are obtained repeatedly inserting in the same recursion relation of eq.([it_fin ] ) : @xmath62 }     \\\\",
    "b(0,0,n_{2}+2,1 , \\cdots , 0,0 ) & =   a_{2 } \\frac { b(0,0,n_{2},1,\\cdots , 0,0 )   } { i k_{2 } [ n+1 ] }        \\\\ & \\vdots \\\\ b(0,0,0,0 , \\cdots , n_{n}+2,1 ) & =   a_{n } \\frac { b(0,0,0,0,\\cdots , n_{n},1 )   } { i k_{n } [ n+1 ] }          \\\\ \\end{split } \\label{w_prop}\\ ] ] by discussing the error - propagation in eq.([w_prop ] ) instead of eq.([it_fin ] ) has the advantage that we can investigate the stability of every pair ( @xmath63 ) in the data - spectrum .",
    "suppose that all the parameters @xmath61 and @xmath60 in the data lead to coefficients @xmath64 in eq.([w_prop ] ) which are stable for error - propagation .",
    "this implies that automatically all the other coefficients @xmath64 ( which are computed by solving eq.([it_fin ] ) ) are also stable for error - propagation .",
    "if there are pairs ( @xmath63 ) leading to instabilities , we can simply remove them from the data - set and hence a stable inverse scattering problem remains . before computing the lyapunov exponents , it is convenient to introduce a more efficient formulation .",
    "we firstly define coefficients @xmath65 in the following way : @xmath66 due to imperfections in the data - set , we have to investigate the stability of the iteration series ( [ it_fin ] ) under the variations @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively .",
    "if we insert these perturbations in eq.([it_fin ] ) , we obtain the following result for the perturbation @xmath70 : @xmath71 \\label{stab_1}\\ ] ] where the operator @xmath72 $ ] which expresses the error made per iteration is given by : @xmath73 = \\frac { a_{i } } { i[n+1]k_{i } }   [ \\ : \\cdot \\ : ] -   \\frac {   b_{i}^{(n ) } \\delta a_{i}- a_{i } b_{i}^{(n ) } [ n+1 ] \\delta k_{i } } {   [ n+1]^{2}k_{i}^{2 }   }   \\label{stab_2}\\ ] ] in principle , after @xmath74 iterations , we obtain an error which yields : @xmath75 \\label{stab_4}\\ ] ] if the number of iterations @xmath74 is large we can re - express eq.([stab_4 ] ) in the following from : @xmath76 where the averaged growth of the error per iteration @xmath77 is given by : @xmath78 eq.([stab_5 ] ) can be reformulated as : @xmath79 where @xmath80 we have obtained a closed expression for the lyapunov exponent @xmath81 which describes the average growth of errors per iteration .",
    "although the the expression for the lyapunov exponents may look complicated , the method can easily be implemented numerically .",
    "if the lyapunov exponent is positive the errors in the coefficients grow .",
    "if the lyapunov negative the errors damp out . in the latter case",
    "the inverse scattering problem is not sensitive for small errors in the data . in principle , we have obtained a practical approach to stabilize the inverse scattering problem since each of the lyapunov exponents associated with eq.([stab_8 ] ) corresponds to a single fourier component of the data - spectrum . by removing the fourier components associated with a positive lyapunov exponent , we can find a stable sub - set of the data - spectrum .",
    "we illustrate this principle numerically for the case that that we have only one fourier component .",
    "if we assume that there are only uncertainties in @xmath82 , we obtain that the lyapunov exponent is given by : @xmath83 in fig.1 , the result of the reconstruction is presented for @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "it follows from eq.([cond1 ] ) that for this choice of the coefficients @xmath86 and @xmath87 , the lyapunov exponent is negative and the inverse scattering problem is stable .",
    "if the experiment is repeated with the same value of @xmath87 but with @xmath88 , the curve corresponding to the reconstruction can not be distinguished from the unperturbed construction .",
    "this situation changes if we choose @xmath89 and keep @xmath86 equal to unity .",
    "the reconstruction is for this case presented by the solid line in fig.2 . in this case",
    "the reconstruction is according to eq.([cond1 ] ) sensitive to small changes in @xmath86 . indeed , if we solve the inverse scattering problem for @xmath88 , we find that the reconstruction given by the broken curve in fig.2 differs from the unperturbed solution .",
    "this simple example indicates that the ratio between @xmath86 and @xmath87 determines whether the inverse scattering problem is stable or not .",
    "the results given in eq.([w_prop ] ) indicate that a similar result holds in more general cases and forms in principle a tool to investigate which part of the data leads to stable inversion results . in principle",
    "if @xmath90 , instabilities in the obtained solutions can be expected .",
    "however in contrast to the results presented in ref.@xcite , we show in this paper that there is a delicate balance between the amplitude @xmath86 and frequency @xmath87 of each fourier component to provide stable inversion results .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a method to solve the one - dimensional marchenko equation for finite data - sets and to investigate the stability of the obtained solutions .",
    "we have established a recursion relationship between the fourier expansion coefficients of the data and the fourier expansion coefficients of the kernel .",
    "we have also shown that we can estimate the stability of the obtained solutions from the data - uncertainties by using lyapunov exponents .",
    "we want to remark that investigating the stability of the marchenko has become an easy task from computational point of view since we have presented the lyapunov exponents in an analytically closed form .",
    "a practical approach to find a stabilizing transformation for a potentially unstable data - set consists of simply removing all the unstable pairs @xmath91 from the data .",
    "the low frequency components in the spectrum are responsible for the instabilities . instead of bandpass filtering the data - set ( to remove the low - frequency components of the data ) , the method presented in this publication enables us to identify the pairs @xmath91 , and their removal leads to a more accurate regularization method for the inverse scattering problem .    as a concluding remark we have a renewed look on the examples of data - contaminations given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the first example discussed in this paper is a small dc - error on the data - set which leads unstable inversion results .",
    "it is shown that a dc - error corresponds with a fourier component with vanishing @xmath16 . as a result of the discussion given in this paper ,",
    "it can be understood easily that a vanishing @xmath16 leads to a positive lyapunov exponent .",
    "the other examples discussed in ref.@xcite deal with an amplitude error and a timing error .",
    "it is shown for both examples that if the data - set contains fourier components with small @xmath16 , that inverse scattering problem is unstable .",
    "the results obtained in this paper are in agreement with ref.@xcite , but additionally quantitative results are given .",
