    "a quantum state of a qubit can be remotely prepared with the help of a preshared nonclassical bipartite resource state and a classical communication channel .",
    "this is called remote state preparation ( rsp )  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea lies as follows  @xcite : alice and bob share a bipartite nonclassical state , for example , a maximally entangled qubit ( ebit ) in the ideal case . after a local measurement along certain direction at alice s side , alice sends bob one classical bit ( cbit ) , which tells bob whether or not to flip his qubit , in order to obtain the state as desired .",
    "several experiments for this scheme have been carried out , e.g. , by nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) techniques  @xcite .    in the ideal case ,",
    "when the resource state is a maximally entangled state , the desired target state can be prepared perfectly at bob s side , i.e. , with fidelity equal to one . however , in practice , the resource state for rsp is usually a mixed one , thus we can not always complete a perfect preparation .",
    "the efficiency of successfully doing this task can be measured by rsp - fidelity  @xcite . since rsp can not be carried out without a nonclassical resource state , rsp - fidelity to some extent",
    "describes the  quantumness \" of the bipartite resource state , which is similar with quantum discord  @xcite .",
    "recently , a surprising discovery has been made , which connects the rsp - fidelity with the geometric measure of quantum discord ( gmqd )  @xcite .",
    "they find that the necessary condition for a resource state to afford non - zero fidelity of rsp is that it must have nonzero quantum discord , rather than nonzero entanglement .",
    "furthermore , they explicitly show that for a broad class of states , the rsp - fidelity is equal to the gmqd .",
    "hence their work links gmqd to an operational meaning .",
    "some works point out that quantum discord can in- crease via local operations  @xcite .",
    "for instance , a state with zero discord @xmath0 can be transformed into a state with non - zero discord @xmath1 by a local operation acting on the first qubit such that @xmath2 , @xmath3 , with @xmath4 .",
    "it can be verified that @xmath5 is a trace - preserving and completely positive map .",
    "this fact makes us conjecture that rsp - fidelity , which is accessible in experiment , may share the similar property of local increase .    in this paper",
    ", we study the influence of local operations on the rsp - fidelity .",
    "we prove that the rsp - fidelity does not increase for unital local operation .",
    "however , for nonunital local operation , such as local amplitude damping channel , we find that some resource states can be enhanced to increase the rsp - fidelity .",
    "we give the optimal parameter of symmetric local amplitude damping channel for enhancing bell - diagonal resource states .",
    "meanwhile , we observe some interesting dynamic behaviors of rsp - fidelity .",
    "rsp - fidelity under local decoherence has the effect of sudden change and can vanish at instant .",
    "particularly , the behavior of vanishing at instant indicates rsp - fidelity is more fragile than discord against decoherence , and therefore should take more enhancement .",
    "we organize the remains of this paper as follows . in sec .",
    "[ secii ] , we briefly review the rsp protocol and the connection between rsp - fidelity and gmqd . in sec .",
    "[ seciii ] , we study the influence of two types of local operations , the unital and the nonunital ones , on the rsp - fidelity",
    ". a necessary condition for local increase of rsp - fidelity is obtained .",
    "we also give a criterion of enhancibility for bell - diagonal states under a symmetric local amplitude damping channel , as well as the optimal parameter of the channel .",
    "finally , in sec .",
    "[ seciv ] , we summarize our results .",
    "in this section , we first introduce rsp based on the protocol in ref .",
    ". then we make a quantitative comparison between rsp - fidelity and gmqd .      the concrete rsp protocol that our paper deals with comes from pati  @xcite , where alice intends to remotely prepare a pure qubit state from an ensemble represented by a great circle on the bloch sphere using only one cbit and one preshared nonclassical bipartite resource state .",
    "the basic idea ( also described by daki _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ) is as follows : the target qubit , which is denoted as @xmath6 or a bloch vector @xmath7 , is chosen from the great circle of the bloch ball orthogonal to a unit vector @xmath8 .",
    "a nonclassical state is preshared as resource state by both parties . since in rsp",
    "alice knows exactly what the target state is , she can choose such a unit vector @xmath9 to perform a local measurement along that would help to prepare the target state at bob s side with the highest achievable fidelity  @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the case when alice and bob have an singlet state @xmath10 as resource state , alice can perform a measurement along the direction @xmath11 and then send bob the measurement outcome @xmath12 as one cbit information . for @xmath13 ,",
    "bob applies a @xmath14 rotation about @xmath15 , and for @xmath16 , bob does nothing .",
    "after this , the resulting state @xmath17 on bob s side will be nothing but the target state @xmath7 .",
    "there is nothing special about sharing a singlet state as resource state .",
    "one can use any other maximally entangled states to achieve the same goal up to a change of measurement direction at alice s side . in general , when the resource state is not maximally entangled , the resulting state @xmath17 may differ from the target state @xmath7 . in order to evaluate the efficiency of rsp , daki _ et al . _",
    "@xcite introduce the notion of payoff - function @xmath18 . in each run , by deliberately choosing the measurement direction , alice can optimize the payoff - function .",
    "we denote the optimized payoff - function by @xmath19 .",
    "the rsp - fidelity averages the optimized payoff - function and is minimized over all @xmath15 on bloch sphere , i.e. , @xmath20 the rsp - fidelity captures two most natural aspects , @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , for the resource state maximally entangled , while @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) for the maximally mixed .    by representing a two - qubit resource state @xmath25 in terms of pauli matrices @xmath26 @xmath27 , \\label{eqbloch}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 , @xmath8 are local bloch vectors , the rsp - fidelity can be written as @xmath29 here the coefficients @xmath30 form a real matrix denoted by @xmath31 , and @xmath32",
    "are the eigenvalues of @xmath33 . for simplicity",
    ", we will skip the derivation of this expression , one can consult ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "for rsp with only classical resource , where @xmath34 , non - zero rsp - fidelity is impossible . since rsp - fidelity is a function of state , we can compare it with gmqd and this is what we are going to do in the next subsection .",
    "gmqd is introduced by the motivation for capturing total quantum correlation  @xcite .",
    "the original paper defines gmqd as the square of the hilbert - schmidt distance from the given state to the set of classical - quantum states , i.e. , @xmath35 where @xmath36^{1/2}$ ] , the infimum is taken over the set of classical - quantum states @xmath37 . in order to make fair comparison with rsp - fidelity",
    ", we normalize the gmqd by a factor 2 , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , and deal with the normalized gmqd ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 following ref .",
    "@xcite , we have @xmath40 with @xmath41 being the largest eigenvalue of @xmath42 . in this paper , we also treat vectors as column matrices , like @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ eqdg ] ) .    based on eq .",
    "( [ eqdg ] ) , we can see for a broad set of states the ( normalized ) gmqd matches the rsp - fidelity .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath43 , with equality if and only if @xmath28 is parallel to the eigenvector corresponding to largest eigenvalue of @xmath44 .",
    "this set is a strict subset of the set of all x states  @xcite and is big enough to contain all the maximally mixed marginal states  @xcite . generally , @xmath45",
    "@xmath46 if and only if @xmath47 and @xmath48 , so @xmath49 is a necessary but not sufficient condition for @xmath50 .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows a concrete example of @xmath49 but @xmath23 .",
    "however , @xmath51 and @xmath52 simultaneously reaches @xmath53 when @xmath25 is maximally entangled .",
    "this is because , with respect to gmqd , the set of maximally discordant states is equivalent to that of maximally entangled states .",
    "in addition , both @xmath54 and @xmath55 are invariant under local unitary transformation , i.e. , for any unitary matrices @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "mathematically , performing a local unitary transformation is nothing but rechoosing a new local basis to represent the same density operator @xmath25 , which obviously wo nt change @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "in this section , we study the behaviors of rsp - fidelity under local operation . for this purpose",
    ", we separately discuss the characteristics of the resource state under action of two types of quantum operations , the unital and the nonunital ones . at last , we give a criterion for testing the enhancibility of a bell - diagonal state under symmetric local amplitude damping channel and the optimal parameter of such channel .",
    "quantum operations or , from the viewpoint of decoherence , quantum channels are trace - preserving and completely positive maps , which are used for describing the dynamic changes to a state",
    ". a quantum operation @xmath5 is said to be unital , if and only if @xmath59 , or else it is nonunital . after introducing a representation of quantum operation , we will give the proposition that rsp - fidelity does not increase for any unital local operation .",
    "usually , a quantum operation is represented by kraus operators . here",
    "we deal with another representation for the convenience of the following proof  @xcite .",
    "recall that any qubit @xmath25 can be represented by a bloch vector @xmath17 , so that @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the vector of pauli matrices .",
    "accordingly , any single qubit operation @xmath5 , which maps a density matrix to another density matrix , can be represented by a unique @xmath62 matrix @xmath63 , which maps a bloch vector to another one , @xmath64 here @xmath65 is a @xmath66 matrix and @xmath67 , @xmath63 has the form @xmath68 where @xmath69 is zero vector , @xmath70 and @xmath71 matrix @xmath72 are real . for a unital operation @xmath5",
    ", we have @xmath73 . using the singular value decomposition ,",
    "we can write @xmath74 where @xmath75 are orthogonal matrices , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are rotations . a common convention is to list @xmath78 in descending order . in this case",
    ", the diagonal matrix @xmath79 is unique .",
    "define the map @xmath80 by @xmath81 with @xmath82 .",
    "since every rotation on a bloch vector is equivalent to a unitary transformation on the respective density operator , the general quantum operation @xmath5 can be factorized into simpler parts as @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are unitary matrices corresponding to @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "now we come to the following proposition .",
    "rsp - fidelity of two - qubit states do not increase under local unital operations .    according to eq .",
    "( [ eqdecomp ] ) , an arbitrary local unital operation @xmath5 on a two - qubit state @xmath25 can be given as @xmath88 where @xmath89 , @xmath90 are unitary and @xmath80 is represented by the matrix @xmath91 here we have used the fact that , for a unital operation , @xmath92 .",
    "the trace - preserving and completely positive property of @xmath5 requires both the points represented by @xmath93 , @xmath94 are constrained inside a tetrahedron with corners @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98  @xcite . since @xmath99 is invariant under local unitary transformation ( see sec .",
    "[ seciib ] ) , we can restrict our considerations to those local unital operations which have @xmath80-form as in eq .",
    "( [ eqphid ] ) .",

    "the above proposition excludes the possibility of enhancing the rsp resource with unital local operations , such as the direct product of single qubit depolarizing , bit flip , phase flip and bit - phase flip channels .      in this subsection , we transfer our attention to symmetric local amplitude damping channel to see if a suitable local nonunital operation can bring some enhancement to the resource states .",
    "amplitude damping channel is a typical kind of nonunital operation that characterizes the behavior of energy dissipation in a lot of concrete physical processes , such as spontaneous emission of an atom , behavior of a spin system approaching equilibrium with the environment at high - temperature .",
    "although , in quantum information theory , the concept of amplitude damping channel originates in quantum noise processes , amplitude damping channels are experimentally achievable  @xcite .    given an initial qubit @xmath25 , the action of a one - qubit quantum operation on it can be given by @xmath110 , where @xmath111 are the kraus operators .",

    "in addition , we restrict the resource states for rsp to bell - diagonal states , which are diagonal in the bell basis ( @xmath119 , @xmath120 ) .",
    "a bell - diagonal state @xmath25 can also be expressed by pauli matrices as @xmath121 the condition for @xmath25 being a proper density matrix imposes that the point made of coordinates @xmath122 must lie inside the tetrahedron with the four bell states being the corners ( see fig .",
