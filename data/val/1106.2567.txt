    "the role of structural topology in the magnetic and superconducting properties of the newly discovered iron - based superconductors ( fesc ) is one of the active themes of investigation @xcite focussing on finding the mechanisms of the unconventional superconductivity .",

    "this local inhomogenity is found to have a direct consequence on the electronic properties of the system @xcite .",
    "all these point to the importance of the diverging local structure from the average one , putting the fesc on the same platform of cuprates , revealing lattice anomalies and local inhomogeneities @xcite , closely related with the superconducting properties .",

    "however , such anomalies are found to be much weaker , compared to those observed in the cuprates @xcite .    here ,",
    "we have used extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) , a fast and site - specific experimental tool @xcite , to probe systematically the local structure of ndfeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 oxypnictides as a function of temperature and charge density .",

    "for the temperature dependent measurements ( 15 - 300 k ) , a continuous flow he cryostat with a temperature control within an accuracy of @xmath61 k was used .",

    "the uncertainities in the derived two paramters , r and @xmath24 , were estimated by standard exafs method @xcite .",
