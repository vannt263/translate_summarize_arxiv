    "[ sec_intro ]    since the discovery of the first exoplanet @xcite , more than 650 planets have been confirmed , among which more than 400 have been found using the radial velocity method @xcite .",
    "currently , state - of - the - art spectrometers , such as harps @xcite on the 3.6-m telescope in la silla and hires on keck i @xcite , typically achieve precisions of 1 - 3  m  s@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this only permits the detection of planets with rv amplitudes comparable to or slightly less than the measurement errors , typically super - earths or neptune - mass planets in relatively short period orbits , or more massive jupiter - like planets out to several au .",
    "the earth induces a reflex velocity of only 9  cm  s@xmath0 on the sun , so the search for true earth analogs requires doppler precisions of about 10 - 20  cm  s@xmath0 , corresponding to typical spectral line shifts across one ten - thousandth of a pixel . further complicating the analysis ,",
    "the periodicity of this shift occurs over time scales of months or year for the most interesting planets in the so - called habitable zone .",
    "this requirement for a measurement precision of 10  cm  s@xmath0 leads to the demand for an instrument that exceeds the stability of current instruments .    in order to reach the desired precision",
    ", we must reduce variability in the instrumental profile , which cross - talks with the modeled wavelength parameters and introduces errors in our measurement of the doppler shift . in many spectrographs ,",
    "the starlight is coupled from the telescope to the instrument using a narrow slit .",
    "however , the slit illumination varies rapidly because of changes in seeing , focus and guiding errors .",
    "changes in slit illumination affect the spectrum in two ways .",
    "since the spectral lines are direct images of the slit , changes in slit illumination produce changes in the shape of the spectral lines .",
    "additionally , variations in slit illumination can result in changes in the illumination of the spectrograph optics .",
    "this will in turn introduce different aberrations , which will change the instrumental response .",
    "mathematically , these two effects are modeled simultaneously by convolving the spectrum with the instrumental profile .",
    "any instrumental profile variability impedes our ability to recover doppler shifts with the desired precision .",
    "if the instrumental profile were unchanging , variations in the final extracted spectrum would be dramatically reduced .",
    "thus , instrumental profile stability has become a focus of current instrumentation work .",
    "optical fibers provide an excellent way to reduce variability in the illumination of the spectrograph .",
    "fibers have been used since the 1980 s to couple telescopes to high - precision spectrographs @xcite .",
    "the throughput of fibers was initially low , however , they offered unprecedented convenience in mechanical design .",
    "the attribute of fibers that is particularly important today for high - precision doppler measurements is the natural ability of optical fibers to scramble light @xcite , that is to produce a more uniform and constant output beam , independently of the input . because light from the telescope must be efficiently coupled into the fiber",
    ", the fiber diameters must match the size of the seeing disk ( generally 100 microns or more ) , so multi - mode fibers are required .    we have designed an optical fiber feed , finds , for the hamilton spectrograph at lick observatory @xcite that stabilizes the illumination of the spectrograph and the instrumental profile . in this paper , we report the different tests carried out with the fiber scrambler on the hamilton spectrograph at lick observatory @xcite . in section  [ sec_terms ] , we define the terminology used throughout this paper . in section  [ sec_design ]",
    ", we present the design of the lick fiber scrambler . in section  [ sec_guiding ] , we report some guiding tests that we have performed with and without fiber feed . in section  [ sec_pupil ] and",
    "section  [ sec_psf ] , we analyze the intensity distribution evolution after the slit in the far - field and in the near - field . in section  [ sec_slitfiber ] ,",
    "we show a comparison between slit and fiber instrumental stability using the hamilton spectrograph . in section  [ sec_doublescrambler ]",
    ", we present the results obtained with a double scrambler at lick observatory . in section  [ sec_psfvar ] ,",
    "we present evidence of instrumental profile variations as a function of hour angle .",
    "finally , radial velocities are presented in section  [ sec_rv ] .",
    "[ sec_terms ]    historically in high - resolution spectrometers , the terms point spread function ( psf ) and line spread function ( lsf ) have been used interchangeably by astronomers to describe the way an infinitely narrow spectral line is broadened by the instrument .",
    "this broadening occurs either by choice of a finite size slit or fiber that sets the spectrograph resolution or by the quality of the optics and the alignment of the spectrograph that degrades the resolution .",
    "the broadened line for any given wavelength is simply the image of the slit or the fiber by the optical system that is the spectrograph .",
    "neither psf nor lsf should be used in this sense , since they already have a meaning that differs from this .",
    "psf is a term that should strictly be used in optical design : as its name indicates , it is the response of a given optical system to a point ( dimensionless ) source of light . the slits and multi - mode fibers used in all current spectrographs are not point sources .",
    "they have a finite size .",
    "if they could be considered as point sources , doubling their size should not affect the spectrograph resolution .",
    "the psf is a characteristic of the instrument and only of the instrument , not of the slit illumination .",
    "it only tells us about the quality of the optical system and is independent on the choice of slit . in good approximation ,",
    "the actual image on the ccd is the convolution of the psf by the slit illumination function ( the light intensity distribution over the slit , for which a good approximation is 0 outside the slit and 1 within the slit ) .",
    "similarly , the term lsf is used to describe the response of the instrument to a line source , i.e. an infinitely narrow and infinitely long slit . again , our slits are finite and the image of the slit on the ccd is the convolution of the lsf by the slit illumination function",
    ".    a more accurate term would be spectral line spread function ( slsf ) , which as its name indicates , simply represents the broadening and distortion of a spectral line by the instrument : this includes both psf ( or lsf ) and the slit illumination function .",
    "therefore , throughout this paper , we will only refer to slsf when we mean broadening and distortion of spectral lines .",
    "[ sec_design ]    the hamilton is an echelle spectrograph with a resolution ranging from 60,000 to 100,000 .",
    "it is permanently mounted at the coud focus of the shane 3-m telescope .",
    "alternatively , the spectrograph can be fed by a 0.6-m coud auxiliary telescope ( cat ) when the 3-m is not configured for coud observing .",
    "the hamilton covers a spectral range between 350 and 900  nm . to obtain precise radial velocities with this spectrograph",
    ", we use an iodine cell as a wavelength calibrator @xcite .",
    "as starlight passes through the cell , the molecular iodine imposes thousands of absorption lines in the stellar spectrum .",
    "the iodine lines are mostly present between 500 and 600  nm . therefore , all results presented here correspond to this limited spectral range .",
    "light from the telescope falls onto the slit with a focal ratio of f/36 .",
    "the slit used for our regular observing program is 640  @xmath1 m wide , which corresponds to 1.2  arcsec on sky .",
    "typical seeing varies from 1.5 to 2  arcsec .",
    "all slits are oriented along the meridian and atmospheric dispersion is not compensated .",
    "light reflected off the edges of the slit is then directed towards the guider camera .",
    "a green filter is used for guiding since we are mostly interested in the spectral range covered by the iodine lines .",
    "a schematic drawing of the fiber feed is depicted in figure  [ fig_setup ] .",
    "we have chosen to position this fiber system after the slit in order to ease the integration and keep the current acquisition and guiding system .",
    "light coming from the slit is picked off by a mirror @xmath2 ( which can move in and out of the way ) and is focused with an achromatic doublet @xmath3 onto the optical fiber .",
    "@xmath3 transforms the f/36 beam into a f/4 beam before entering the fiber . for alignment purposes ,",
    "a pellicle beam splitter is inserted into the beam between @xmath3 and the fiber .",
    "light reflected off the fiber front surface would then be reflected by the pellicle and sent to a camera ( basler sca640 ) .",
    "this pellicle and camera are only used to check that the fiber and the slit are co - aligned .",
    "the pellicle would then be removed during observations .",
    "after the fiber , a second achromatic doublet @xmath4 is used to give the beam its original focal ratio and to re - image the end of the fiber onto a virtual source located at the same distance from the collimator as the original slit .",
    "light is then sent to the collimator with another mirror @xmath5 .",
    "the fiber used in these tests is a 15-m fbp100120140 from polymicro .",
    "both ends are anti - reflection coated ( @xmath6 for 500 - 600  nm ) .",
    "[ fig_setup ]    after setting the fiber feed behind the slit , the throughput was 65@xmath7 throughput means that the exposure time without fiber should be 0.65 times the exposure time with fiber to achieve the same snr . ] .",
    "the throughput is rather low for such a short fiber feed .",
    "we believe this low throughput may have been caused by the focal ratio degradation of the fiber and by non - optimized optical design .",
    "however , for the purpose of these tests , a high throughput was not essential and therefore was not optimized in this regard .",
    "the fiber has a 1.6  arcsec field of view ( 100-@xmath1 m fiber fed at f/4 ) , which is larger than the slit used in our regular observing program ( 1.2  arcsec ) . however , because the width of a round fiber varies as a function of height from 0 to its diameter , the effective width of the fiber is smaller than its diameter .",
    "this is referred to as the resolution boost factor of fiber - fed instruments @xcite .",
    "this factor is @xmath8 for round fibers compared to a slit .",
    "this gives an effective width of 1.3  arcsec , which yields a @xmath9% loss in resolution compared to our regular slit .",
    "[ sec_guiding ]    as part of the testing phase at lick , we carried out a simple guiding test with the fiber on the 3-m shane telescope . in this test , we obtained spectra of the iodine cell illuminated by a bright b - type star .",
    "we first obtained spectra using the slit without the fiber feed ( i.e. , typical of our usual program observations ) .",
    "we then inserted the fiber scrambler in the light path for the sets of test observations .",
    "for each set , we intentionally guided the telescope with the image of the star ( a ) approximately 1  arcsec on one side of the slit center , ( b ) centered on the slit and ( c ) 1  arcsec on the other side of the slit center .",
    "we used the 640-@xmath1 m slit for all observations ( even for fiber observations , since the fiber is located after the slit ) .",
    "this slit corresponds to 1.2  arcsec on sky ( and a two - pixel resolution of 60,000 ) .",
    "typical seeing varies from 1.5 to 2  arcsec and guiding errors of 0.2 - 0.3  arcsec typically occur . at lick",
    ", there is no atmospheric dispersion compensator and the slit is oriented along the meridian .",
    "a green filter is used for guiding .",
    "we cross - correlated each series of observations with spectra obtained when the star was properly guided at the center of the slit .",
    "figure  [ fig_guiding ] shows the mean pixel shift as a function of the guiding position across the width of the slit for the central echelle order .",
    "the difference from this first test is remarkable : the iodine lines shift in the dispersion direction by up to 0.4 pixels ( @xmath10    at 600  nm ) without a fiber .",
    "in contrast , we see that observations obtained with the fiber are far more stable with iodine line shifts of the order of 0.01 pixels ( @xmath11    at 600  nm ) .",
    "the data points of figure  [ fig_guiding ] correspond to cross - correlations of the 100 central pixels of the central echelle order .",
    "we repeated the same analysis for all echelle orders with iodine absorption lines ( 14 ) for slit ( figure  [ fig_crosscororders ] , left ) and fiber ( figure  [ fig_crosscororders ] , right ) observations .",
    "figure  [ fig_crosscororders ] ( left ) shows that the pixel shift introduced by guiding errors is wavelength - dependent for slit observations .",
    "this means that not only spectral lines are shifted on the ccd but also that the wavelength solution is affected by these guiding errors .",
    "this wavelength - dependence in pixel shift introduced by guiding errors is probably due to the lack of atmospheric dispersion compensation and changes in the illumination of the spectrograph optics that introduce wavelength - dependent systematic errors .",
    "we see on figure  [ fig_crosscororders ] ( right ) that guiding errors induce almost no wavelength - dependent pixel shift when the fiber is used , due to its scrambling properties .",
    "it is worth noting that , for absorption - based calibrators ( such as iodine lines ) , the position of the lines and the wavelength solutions are not critical since wavelength calibration lines ( i.e. the iodine lines ) are imprinted in the spectrum .",
    "however , even for iodine calibrated spectrographs , stabilizing the spectrum helps to reduce the variability in the slsf and therefore reduces cross - talk between the slsf and wavelength model in the doppler analysis code .",
    "[ fig_guiding ]    [ fig_crosscororders ]",
    "[ sec_pupil ]    the second series of tests that we have performed consists in taking consecutive snapshots of the pupil illumination with and without the fiber to see the improvement in stability of the illumination of the spectrometer optics .    as mentioned in section  [ sec_design ] , the hamilton spectrograph can be fed by a 0.6-m coud auxiliary telescope ( cat ) when the 3-m is not configured for coud observing . for both telescopes ,",
    "the guiding system and spectrograph control remain the same .",
    "however , the plate scale changes by a factor 5 , which deteriorates the guiding performance when using the cat . for these measurements , we used the cat guiding on the bright a - type star , deneb .    in order to measure the far - field after the fiber when guiding on a star , we used a lens and a commercial 752  x  480 pixel 8-bit cmos camera ( orion starshoot and planetary imaging camera ) that we positioned right after the fiber feed . in this case , the lens is not used to image the fiber onto the camera but to fit the entire pupil on the detector .",
    "figure  [ fig_pupil ] includes three consecutive snapshots of the pupil illumination without ( a ) and with the fiber feed ( b ) .",
    "the pictures were taken every 0.33 s without fiber and every 1 s with the fiber . without fiber , we see a non - uniform intensity distribution and important variations from one picture to the other .",
    "the fiber dramatically improves the uniformity and the stability of the illumination of the spectrometer optics .",
    "note that the brighter spot in the snapshots taken with the fiber comes from imperfections in the camera used to take the pictures . even though figure  [ fig_pupil ] illustrates the variability in pupil illumination",
    "when using the slit and shows the improvement brought by the fiber feed , the difference in pupil illumination when using the shane and the cat can be significant due to the different plate scales and the ratio between the aperture and the average size of turbulent cells .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab_vels ]",
    "[ sec_conclusions ]    to summarize , in order to measure spectral line shifts smaller than one ten - thousandth of a pixel and stable for many months , we must reduce errors in our instrumental profile or slsf , which cross - talks with our measurement of the doppler shift .",
    "the slsf variability can be broken down in coupling errors ( slit or fiber illumination ) and environmental instability .    in this paper , we have shown improvement in slsf stability using a fiber scrambler .",
    "these results demonstrate that coupling errors are the dominant source of instrumental profile variability at lick observatory over short time scales .",
    "we show that double scrambler observations have a more stable slsf than fiber observations by a factor  2 .",
    "these have a more stable slsf than slit observations by a factor  2 .",
    "the double scrambler data still has residual rms scatter .",
    "the source of this has not yet been identified but is likely to be modal noise , photon noise or modeling errors .",
    "we do not expect that the residual scatter can be caused by environmental effects due to the random nature of the variability . in the case of the hamilton spectrograph at lick",
    ", we have shown a strong correlation between slsf variations and changes in star position in the sky , most likely due to changes of spectrograph illumination with varying telescope positioning .",
    "finally , we have shown a 30% improvement in radial velocities for hd166620 between fiber and slit observations . for hd161797 and hd143761 ,",
    "the doppler precision was slightly lower but at a significantly lower snr .",
    "scaled to the same snr , fiber radial velocities should have an rms scatter 30% lower than the slit observations .",
    "we acknowledge the support of the planetary society , who made possible the development and installation of the fiber feed at lick observatory .",
    "the authors would like to thank all staff at lick observatory who have helped many times in the implementation of the fiber scramblers .",
    "we are also grateful to kelsey clubb for helping with the observing runs , tom blake for the iodine cell fts spectra and jeff valenti for essential data normalization .",
    "a portion of this research was performed using emsl , a national scientific user facility sponsored by the department of energy s office of biological and environmental research and located at pacific northwest national laboratory .",
