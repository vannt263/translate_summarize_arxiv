    "the present accelerated expansion of the universe is one of the biggest and fascinating cosmic puzzles since its discovery @xcite .",
    "nowadays , we have many independent observational results @xcite that confirmed this claim . in the context of relativistic cosmology ,",
    "an accelerating regime is obtained by assuming an existence of some dark energy ( de ) component , an exotic fluid endowed with negative pressure that occupies about 3/4 of current energy density of the universe .",
    "the cosmological constant , interpreted as the density of energy associated with the quantum vacuum , has become the main candidate for de . such cosmological model is the so called @xmath1 - cold dark matter ( @xmath1cdm ) model , and presents two serious problems , namely , the cosmological constant problem , and the cosmic coincidence problem ( for a review on these issues , see @xcite . because of these problems",
    ", several alternative models have been proposed to explain the late - time accelerated universe @xcite .    however , according to recent observations @xcite the equation of state ( eos ) of dark energy , @xmath6 , has crossed the `` @xmath7 '' boundary . in other words ,",
    "our universe has a slight phantom nature , hence , we need something else which can go beyond ` @xmath7 ' . a natural candidate to realize this @xmath8",
    ", scenario is to introduce a phantom scalar field whose energy density ( @xmath9 ) and pressure ( @xmath10 ) take the forms , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , respectively . hence , the eos , @xmath13 . since the kinetic part contains the wrong sign @xcite , phantom scalar fields lead to some instabilities at the classical and quantum levels @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been noticed that , this kind of fields suffer from other serious theoretical problems @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural to look for alternative ways to drive the accelerated expansion of the universe up to the phantom region without any of the aforementioned difficulties .",
    "a viable choice which could be an alternative to both dark energy and gravity modified models , is the matter creation models by gravitational field , where this kind of models can mimic @xmath1cdm cosmology @xcite .",
    "note that , matter creation in cosmology is not a new idea , rather it has a long history since its introduction by parker and collaborators @xcite .",
    "parker assumed that , the material content of the universe may have lead its origin from the continuous creation of radiation and matter from the gravitational field of the expanding universe acting on the quantum vacuum .",
    "this continuous matter creation does not depend on the theory of gravity .",
    "further , the produced particles have some well defined properties  they gain mass , momentum and energy from the time - evolving gravitational background which converts curvature into particles by a pumping mechanism , as if the gravity pumps on the curvature to produce particles .",
    "prigogine et al .",
    "@xcite compelled matter creation into the einstein s field equations , in a consistent way by introducing in the usual balance equation for the number density of particles , @xmath14 , a source term in the right hand side that accounts for the production of particles as    @xmath15    here , @xmath16 is the number density of the fluid particles , @xmath17 is the four - velocity vector of the created particles which is normalized , so that @xmath18 , and @xmath19 denotes the particle production rate .",
    "note that , in the radiation dominated era , the production of radiation particles vanished ( parker s theorem ) @xcite .",
    "taking into account the second law of thermodynamics in the discussion , by means of a covariant formalism , it has been found that , eq . ( [ eq : nbalance ] ) can lead some extra pressure quantity , which is directly related to the particle creation rate @xmath19 , and hence they termed as `` creation pressure '' @xcite , which has further been confirmed by using relativistic kinetic theory @xcite . since the entropy flux vector of matter , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes the entropy per particle , must fulfill the second law of thermodynamics @xmath22 , therefore we have the constraint @xmath23 on the particle creation rate .",
    "hence , matter creation entered into the cosmological domain and confirmed its place @xcite .",
    "recently , nunes and pavn @xcite showed that , the matter creation models can realize the phantom universe without the need of invoking any phantom fields @xcite .",
    "motivated by the models introduced in @xcite , we establish a canonical scalar field description equivalent to matter creation and study its behavior with the expansion of the universe .",
    "further , we analyze the effects of this matter creation on the cosmic microwave background spectrum compared to those predicted by the @xmath1cdm model . then we introduce a model independent treatment for matter creation models , which is generally used to filter several cosmological models from @xmath1cdm by providing a null test , where the test also tells whether the cosmological model has a phantom or quintessence behavior .",
    "it is interesting to note that , we do not need to know the value of the present day hubble parameter and the accurate value of the matter density for such test .",
    "in addition to that , any particle creation model , must agree with thermodynamics , more specifically , with the generalized second law of thermodynamics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the next section [ sec : models ] gives a brief overview of phenomenological matter creation in cosmology , and introduces the models .",
    "section [ sec : sf ] presents an equivalent scalar field description of the models . section [ sec : cmb ] analyses the effects on the cmb power spectra coming from the matter creation models , and also compares those effects with respect to the standard cosmological model @xmath1cdm .",
    "section [ sec : om ] presents a model independent treatment , called @xmath0 diagnostic , for our models . in section [ sec : thermodynamics ]",
    ", we discuss the generalized second law of thermodynamics ( gslt ) bounded by apparent horizon .",
    "the concluding section summarizes and gives comments on our findings . as usual , a subindex zero attached to any quantity means that it must be evaluated at present time .",
    "we note that , throughout the text , we have used matter creation , particle creation , particle production synonymously .",
    "let us consider a spatially flat friedmann - lematre- robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the scale factor of the flrw universe .",
    "the einstein s field equations for a perfect fluid endowed with an adiabatic particle production can be written as    @xmath26    where an overdot means differentiation with respect to the cosmic time ; @xmath27 , is the hubble rate ; @xmath28 , @xmath29 are respectively the energy density and pressure of the matter content . as is well - known , this @xmath30 is given by @xcite    @xmath31    therefore , if @xmath32 is negative , it may drive the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "it has been shown that , the production of ordinary particles is much limited by the tight constraints imposed by local gravity measurements @xcite , and radiation has practically no impact on the late - time accelerated expansion of our universe .",
    "therefore , we assume that the produced particles are just the cold dark matter particles .    in this study , we consider that the energy density splits in three components , baryons , cold dark matter , and the quantum vacuum , i.e. @xmath33 . now ,",
    "as the cold dark matter particles are created from the gravitational field , hence eq .",
    "( [ pressure_creation ] ) takes the form    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is defined as the equation of state due to the cold dark matter creation by this gravitational field , and this is negative for an expanding universe , i.e. for @xmath36 .",
    "the conservation equation for this particle creation becomes    @xmath37    in deriving ( [ dark_matter_evolution ] ) , we have used eq .",
    "( [ eq : nbalance ] ) specialized to dark matter particles , and the relation @xmath38 , where @xmath39 stands for the rest mass of a typical dark matter particle , and @xmath40 is the number of dark matter particles .",
    "since baryons are neither created nor destroyed , the baryonic sector satisfies the following conservation law @xmath41 on the other hand , the cosmological constant @xcite interpreted as the density of energy associated to the quantum vacuum is constant , i.e. @xmath42 .",
    "thus , friedmann equation ( [ friedmann1 ] ) for this scenario can simply be expressed as    @xmath43    where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 are respectively the density parameters for baryons , cold dark matter and vacuum energy , constrained by the relation @xmath47 .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hz ] ) , the dynamics of this model can well be understood once @xmath19 is prescribed .",
    "unfortunately , the exact functional form for @xmath19 is very difficult to obtain before the nature of created cold dark matter particles is known .",
    "hence , we must resort to phenomenological models for @xmath19 , and constrain the dynamics with the observational data . in order to achieve our goal",
    ", we use three parameterizations of @xmath19 found in ref .",
    "@xcite    @xmath48    @xmath49 \\qquad { \\rm ( model \\,\\,\\,\\,\\ ii)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and @xmath50 \\qquad { \\rm ( model \\,\\,\\,\\,\\ iii ) } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is a free parameter of the model characterizing the particle production process , @xmath52 means that , there is no matter creation , otherwise there is production of particles .",
    "if @xmath53 is so high then the matter production rate must be so high . in all cases , @xmath54 .",
    "now , solving the conservation equation ( [ dark_matter_evolution ] ) for the three particle creation models , we find that    @xmath55    where @xmath56 , is the present energy density of the cold dark matter , and @xmath57 , which for all three models can explicitly be given by    @xmath58    for model i , @xmath59 , for very small value of the parameter @xmath53 , while for models ii , iii , @xmath60 , as @xmath61 , hence the creation of dark matter particles does not exceed the standard evolution @xmath62 in future evolution of the universe .",
    "it is worthy to mention that , the scenario proposed in @xcite takes us to the phantom region , i.e. the effective equation of state ( eos ) : @xmath63 , where @xmath35 is the eos associated to the creation pressure ( see eq .",
    "( [ new - pressure - creation ] ) ) , and @xmath64 is the eos of the quantum vacuum .",
    "so , naturally , the need of phantom fields will be weaken @xcite . from a joint analysis of data supernova type ia , gamma ray bursts , baryon acoustic oscillations , and the hubble rate ,",
    "it was obtained that , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 for models i , ii , and iii , respectively at 1@xmath21 confidence level ( see @xcite ) .",
    "further , we note that , the current fractional densities of matter ( baryons @xmath68 dark matter ) is constrained as @xmath69 , for all three models .",
    "here , we obtain an equivalent field theoretic description for the particle creation models . to do this , we replace the energy density ( @xmath70 ) and the creation pressure ( @xmath30 ) for the particle creation models to the corresponding energy density ( @xmath71 ) and the pressure ( @xmath72 ) for a canonical scalar field @xmath73 with potential @xmath74 .",

    "for a cosmological model to be worthy of further investigations , it is not only necessary for the model to be fitted with the current astronomical data , but also , the model should be consistent with the thermodynamics of the universe .",

    "+ in the context of an ever expanding flrw universe , the full version of the thermodynamic law implies that the entropy of the apparent horizon plus that of matter and fields enclosed by it must fulfill @xmath172 , for any scale factor , the so - called generalized second law of thermodynamics ( gslt ) , and @xmath173 , as @xmath174 @xcite . + as demonstrated by bak and rey @xcite , cosmic apparent horizons are endowed with an entropy proportional to the horizon area , much in the same way as black holes have an entropy that varies as the area of its event horizon . unlike cosmic event horizons",
    ", the apparent horizon always exists and coincides with the former in case of a final de sitter expansion .",
    "+ thus , in accordance with the gslt , the total entropy @xmath175 is contributed by two terms : the entropy of the apparent horizon , @xmath176 with @xmath177 being the area of the horizon , and the entropy of the fluids and fields enclosed by it ( pressureless matter in the case at hand ) . here , @xmath178 denotes the radius of the apparent horizon . in our case , for a spatially - flat universe ( @xmath179 ) , the latter coincides with the hubble horizon radius , @xmath180 .",
    "thus , gslt asserts that @xmath181 .",
    "+ recalling the above expression for the horizon entropy , one has @xmath182 .",
    "now , for the model i , we have @xmath183 and for the models ii and iii , we have @xmath184 \\ , \\omega_{dm0 } a^{-3 }   \\exp \\left(3\\beta \\int_{1}^{a } { \\frac{g(\\tilde{a})}{\\tilde{a } } { \\rm d}\\tilde{a}}\\right )   \\ , \\nonumber\\\\+ \\ , \\omega_{b0 } \\ , a^{-3}\\bigr\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath185 can be found in equations ( [ gaiia ] ) and ( [ gaiiia ] ) .",

    "the same procedure can be applied for model i. + to discern the sign of @xmath211 , it suffices to recall that , @xmath212 ; then @xmath213 , and on the other hand , @xmath214 . combining the last two expressions",
    ", we find that @xmath215 tends to zero from below , i.e. @xmath216 .",
    "note that , the conditions for models ii and iii , in agreement with the thermodynamics , imply that @xmath217 .",
    "for model i , the condition is just @xmath190 .",
    "altogether , when @xmath218 one has @xmath219 , as expected . in other words , for the three phenomenological models considered in this work , our universe behaves as an ordinary macroscopic system @xcite ; i.e. it eventually tends to thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "thus , the same condition that guarantees the fulfillment of the gslt ensures that the total entropy is concave ( @xmath220 ) , at late times .",
    "+ altogether , the observational constraints on the three particle creation models introduced in @xcite , are consistent with the requirement that the universe attains a thermodynamic equilibrium ( i.e. the state of maximum entropy represented by the final de sitter expansion ) in the long run .",
    "cosmological models driven by the gravitational adiabatic particle production have been intensively investigated as a viable alternative to the @xmath1cdm cosmology @xcite .",
    "recently , nunes and pavn @xcite explored the possibility that the eos determined by recent observations @xcite is in reality an effective eos that results from adding the negative eos , @xmath35 ( associated to the particle production pressure from the gravitational field acting on the vacuum ) to the eos of the vacuum itself , @xmath221 . in the present paper ,",
    "we investigate the cosmological consequences of this scenario . we have established a canonical scalar field description for the parametric models , and analyzed the dynamic behavior of the variation of the scalar field , @xmath87 , and the potential @xmath222 , with the evolution of our universe governed by the matter creation process .",
    "further , we have evaluated the matter creation effects on the cmb power spectra , and compared the results with the theoretical prediction for the @xmath1cdm model .",
    "we found that the matter creation phenomena can significantly interfere with the amplitude of perturbations in cmb level , with strong indication from the dynamic nature of the eos associated with the particles production rate ( see eqns .",
    "( [ w_c_1 ] ) - ( [ w_c_3 ] ) ) .",
    "on the other hand , we have introduced a model independent test @xmath4 which distinguishes several cosmological models from @xmath1cdm by providing a null test for the dark energy to be the cosmological constant @xmath1 , for which @xmath136 .",
    "the test is also used to differ several cosmological models by indicating their nature ( phantom or quintessence ) .",
    "we found that , the function @xmath4 for the three models ( see figures [ om_model1 ] , [ om_model2 ] , [ om_model3 ] ) confirms their phantom behavior as constrained by recent observational data ( see last paragraph of section [ sec : models ] ) .",
    "we notice that , the parameter @xmath53 plays an important role to deviate all models from @xmath1cdm , which is very clear from their figures .",
    "furthermore , it is worthy to mention that , model i exhibits similar behavior to both @xmath0 and cmb power spectra , that means if @xmath53 increases , the deviation from @xmath1cdm becomes dominant both in cmb power spectra and by @xmath0 diagnosis . in case of models",
    "ii , iii , we see that if @xmath53 increases , the deviation from @xmath1cdm becomes clearer both in cmb tt power spectra and by @xmath0 functions .",
    "but , cmb ee power spectra do not present any significant variation for different @xmath53 .",
    "further , we examined gslt for the three models , and found that , the observational constraints obtained for the three parametric models proposed in @xcite are in agreement with the requirement that the universe attains a thermodynamic equilibrium in its long run .",
    "we have described the behavior of the models in a compact way in table [ table - comparison ] .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table - comparison ]    finally , the parametric models for particle productions different from the present models are also worth exploring .",
