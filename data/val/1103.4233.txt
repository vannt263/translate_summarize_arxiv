    "ultracompact x - ray binaries ( ucxbs ) are systems with orbital periods ( @xmath2 ) shorter than @xmath31  hr in which a neutron star or black hole accrete matter from a companion low mass star .",
    "their short periods rule out ordinary hydrogen - rich companion stars , since these stars are too big and do not fit in the roche lobe ( nelson et al .",
    "ucxbs are rare objects and their identification is very difficult because of the difficulty to measure @xmath2 in lmxbs .",
    "the most recent compilation of ultracompact x - ray binaries lists 27 candidates ( in t zand et al . , 2007 ) .",

    "2007 , nelemans & jonker 2006 ) .",
    "the remainder were classified as ultracompact x - ray binaries on the base of some combination of tentative orbital period measurements , deep optical spectra lacking hydrogen emission lines , high ratios of x - ray to optical flux , or persistent emission at low fractions of the eddington rate ( in t zand et al .",
    "2007 and references within ) .",

    "in the present paper , we have shown that the binary system 4u  0513 - 40 in ngc  1851 exhibits a clear periodic signal with @xmath11  min in soft x - ray .",
    "this signal is sinusoidal and has an amplitude from @xmath04% to @xmath010% .",
    "it is observed only in two observations ( _ chandra _ and _ bepposax _ after the burst ) when the source is in a typical high / soft state : the energy spectrum is well described as the sum of a comptonized plasma with a temperature of @xmath12 2 - 5 kev and an optical depth of @xmath13  6 and a blackbody component with a thermal temperature of @xmath00.3 - 0.5  kev .",
    "this result is independent from the extrapolated luminosity of the system , which spans from 0.7 to 5.2 @xmath14 erg  s@xmath15 in the 0.5 - 50 kev energy band , for _ chandra _ and _ bepposax _ ( after the burst ) , respectively .",
    "this periodicity is not seen when the source is in a low / hard state ( _ xmm - newton _ and _ integral _ data ) and data is well reproduced by a simple comptonized model with a plasma temperature of @xmath12 15 - 21  kev and an optical depth of @xmath13  2 , without any thermal component . according to our present understanding , the black - body component in the soft state could originate at both the neutron star surface or boundary layer and the surface of an optically - thick accretion disk .",
    "the comptonization component in the hard state may arise from a corona above the disk and/or between the disk and the stellar surface and accretion probably assumes the form of a truncated outer accretion disk ( olive et al .",
    "the origin of these spectral changes is not clear , the thermal temperature ( @xmath00.3 - 0.5 kev ) confirm that the accretion disk is ionized and should not be subject to the standard ionization instability ( done et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the far - ultraviolet photometry obtained with the _ hubble space telescope _ has shown the same periodicity described here ( zurek et al .",
    "these timing properties seen in uv / optical observations and the eclipse observed in the x - ray band imply that the origin of this modulation is of orbital nature and the inclination angle is higher than 80 @xmath16 ( arons and king 1993 ) .",
    "in fact , the orbital motion modulates the soft thermal emission coming from a small region around the neutron star but not the comptonization component generated in a more extended corona above and/or around the neutron star .",
