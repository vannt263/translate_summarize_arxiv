    "one of the most elementary and important lessons of einstein s theory of gravity , general relativity ( gr ) , is that the spatial sections of four dimensional space - time need not be euclidean .",
    "the minkowskian description is just an approximation valid on ( relatively ) local portions of space - time . on larger scales",
    ", however , one must consider the deformations induced by the matter on the geometry , which must be dictated by some set of field equations . in this respect ,",
    "the predictions of gr are in agreement with experiments in scales that range from millimeters to astronomical units , scales in which weak and strong field phenomena can be observed @xcite .",
    "the theory is so successful in those regimes and scales that it is generally accepted that it should also work at larger and shorter scales , and at weaker and stronger regimes .",
    "the validity of these assumptions , obviously , is not guaranteed _ a priori _ regardless of how beautiful and ellegant the theory might appear to the expert .",
    "for this reason , not only must we keep confronting the predictions of the theory with experiments and/or observations at new scales , but also we have to demand theoretical consistency with the other physical interactions and , in particular , in the quantum regime . + extrapolating the validity of gr at the largest scales forces us to draw a picture of the universe that is not yet supported by other independent observations . for instance , to explain the rotation curves of spiral galaxies , we must accept the existence of vast amounts of unseen matter surrounding those galaxies .",
    "additionally , to explain the luminosity - distance relation of distant type ia supernovae and some properties of the distribution of matter and radiation at large scales , we must accept the existence of yet another source of energy with repulsive gravitational properties @xcite .",
    "together those unseen ( or dark ) sources of matter and energy are found to make up to @xmath2 of the total energy of the observable universe !",
    "this huge discrepancy between the gravitationally estimated amounts of matter and energy and the direct measurements via electromagnetic radiation motivates the search for alternative theories of gravity which can account for the large scale dynamics and structure without the need for dark matter and/or dark energy .",
    "+ on the other hand , the difficulties faced by gr to provide a consistent description of singularities and quantum phenomena at high energies ( microscopic or planck scales ) may be an indication that we should go beyond riemannian structures to successfully quantize the theory and avoid singularities .",
    "in fact , the use of the differential geometry of riemannian spaces in the formulation of gr soon led to new developments that , in particular , put forward that there is no logical reason to require or impose at a purely kinematical level that the connection should be the levi - civita connection of the metric .",
    "there is no reason to assume such a strict relation between the metric and affine structures of the theory . in this sense ,",
    "the palatini formulation of gr was essential in the adm hamiltonian formulation of the theory and also played a relevant role in the development of loop quantum gravity , a non - perturbative approach to the quantization of gr .",
    "+ the above arguments support the view that gr may need some kind of extension beyond its usual formulation to address certain observational and theoretical problems . in this work ,",
    "we review some literature related with the cosmic speedup problem and cosmological singularities ( very early universe ) framed within the so - called palatini formalism , an approach in which metric and connection are regarded as independent geometrical objects . though this formulation does not affect the classical dynamics of gr ( when torsion is neglected ) , it does introduce interesting new features as compared to the usual riemannian approach when extensions of the einstein - hilbert lagrangian are considered .",
    "we begin by deriving the field equations of palatini theories in a very general case and then consider some simplifications to make contact with the literature . for a generic palatini",
    "theory in which the connection appears through the riemann tensor or contractions of it , the action can be written as follows @xmath3 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the matter action , @xmath5 represents collectively the matter fields , @xmath6 is a constant with suitable dimensions ( if @xmath7 , then @xmath8 ) , and @xmath9 represents the components of the riemann tensor , the field strength of the connection @xmath10 .",
    "note that since the connection is determined dynamically , i.e. , we assume independence between the metric and affine structures of the theory , we can not assume any _ a priori _ symmetry in its lower indices .",
    "this means that in the variation of the action to obtain the field equations we must bear in mind that @xmath11 , i.e. , we admit the possibility of nonvanishing torsion .",
    "it should be noted that in gr energy and momentum are the sources of curvature , while torsion is sourced by the spin of particles @xcite .",
    "the fact that torsion is usually not consider in introductory courses on gravitation may be rooted in the educational tradition of this subject and the fact that the spin of particles was discovered many years after the original formulation of gr by einstein .",
    "another reason may be that the effects of torsion are very weak in general , except at very high densities , where the role of torsion becomes dominant and may even avoid the formation of singularities @xcite . for these reasons , and to motivate and facilitate the exploration of the effects of torsion in extensions of gr , our derivation of the field equations will be as general as possible ( within reasonable limits ) . + we will assume a symmetric metric tensor @xmath12 and the usual definitions for the ricci scalar @xmath13 and ricci tensor @xmath14 .",

    "in particular , for @xmath158 , the inflationary era is stable and prohibits the end of inflation ; if @xmath159 , then inflation ends with a transition to a matter - dominated phase , which is then followed by late time acceleration ; for @xmath160 , inflation is not possible ; and for @xmath161 one can have the sequence of radiation - dominated , matter - dominated , and late - time de sitter without early - time inflation .",
    "we have seen that cosmological observations ( and local experiments too @xcite ) strongly constrain the form of the @xmath0 gravity lagrangian at low curvatures .",
    "though many @xmath0 models have the ability to produce late - time cosmic acceleration and fit well the background expansion history , they are not in quantitative agreement with the structure and evolution of cosmic inhomogeneities . on the other hand , it can be shown that the fact that matter is concentrated in discrete structures like atoms causes the modified dynamics to manifest also in laboratory experiments , which confirms earlier suspicions on the viability of such models according to their corresponding newtonian and post - newtonian properties .",
    "this is a very disturbing aspect of the models with infrared corrections , which demands the consideration of a microscopic description of the sources and prevents the use of macroscopic , averaged representations of the matter . a careful analysis of this point put forward the existence of non - perturbative effects induced by the palatini dynamics in a number of contexts @xcite .",
    "in this sense , it is worth noting that even though the ground state of hydrogen can be studied using standard perturbative methods , the first and higher excited states do manifest non - perturbative properties @xcite . despite the fact that the modified dynamics is strongly suppressed in regions of high density , non - perturbative effects arise near the zeros of the atomic wavefunctions , where the matter density crosses the characteristic low - density scale of the theory and the gradients of the matter distribution become very important for the dynamics [ see eq.([eq : gab - f ] ) ] .",

    "+      growing interest in the dynamics of the early - universe in palatini theories has arisen , in part , from the observation that the effective equations of loop quantum cosmology @xcite ( lqc ) , a hamiltonian approach to quantum gravity based on the quantization techniques of loop quantum gravity , could be exactly reproduced by a palatini @xmath0 lagrangian @xcite . in lqc ,",
    "non - perturbative quantum gravity effects lead to the resolution of the big bang singularity by a quantum bounce without introducing any new degrees of freedom .",

    "in particular , one finds that the expansion @xmath196 and the shear @xmath197 ( a measure of the degree of anisotropy ) are given by @xmath198 @xmath199 where the constants @xmath200 set the amount and distribution of anisotropy and satisfy the constraint @xmath201 . in the isotropic case , @xmath202 , one has @xmath203 and @xmath204 , with @xmath166 given by eq.([eq : hubble - iso ] ) .",
    "now , since homogeneous and isotropic bouncing universes require the condition @xmath191 at the bounce , a glance at ( [ eq : shear - f(r ) ] ) indicates that the shear diverges as @xmath205 .",
    "this shows that , regardless of how small the anisotropies are initially , isotropic @xmath0 bouncing models with a single fluid characterized by a constant equation of state will develop divergences when anisotropies are present .",
    "it is worth noting that even though @xmath206 diverges at @xmath191 , the expansion and its time derivative @xcite are smooth and finite functions at that point if the density and curvature are finite .",
    "however , one can check by direct calculation that the kretschman scalar @xmath207 diverges at least as @xmath208 , which is a clear geometrical pathology and signals the presence of a physical singularity .",
    "the problems when @xmath103 vanishes seem to be generic in anisotropic models of modified theories of gravity @xcite . it should be noted , however , that the consideration of several fluids , fluids with varying equation of state , or fluids with anisotropic stresses @xcite , could affect the dynamics providing new bouncing mechanisms and preventing the extension of this conclusion to such more realistic cases",
    ". +      the previous section provides reasons to believe that palatini @xmath0 models are not able to produce a fully satisfactory and singularity - free alternative to gr in idealized universes filled with a single perfect fluid with constant equation of state .",
    "though the homogeneous and isotropic case greatly improves the situation with respect to gr , the existence of divergences when anisotropies and inhomogeneities are present spoil the hopes deposited on this kind of lagrangians . to the light of these results , new palatini theories were explored @xcite to determine if the introduction of new elements in the gravitational action could avoid the problems that appear in the @xmath0 models .",
    "this led to the study of isotropic and anisotropic cosmologies of some simple generalization of the @xmath0 family in which the lagrangian takes the form @xmath65 , with @xmath209 , and assuming that @xmath59}=0 $ ] . using the particular lagrangian @xmath210 where @xmath211 is the planck curvature , it was found that completely regular bouncing solutions exist for both isotropic and anisotropic homogeneous cosmologies filled with a perfect fluid . in particular",
    ", one finds that for @xmath212 the interval @xmath213 is always included in the family of bouncing solutions , which contains the dust and radiation cases . for @xmath214 , the fluids yielding a non - singular evolution are restricted to @xmath215 , which implies that the radiation case @xmath216 is always nonsingular . for a detailed discussion and classification of the non - singular solutions depending on the value of the parameter @xmath217 and the equation of state @xmath185 ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "+ according to ( [ eq : gmn ] ) and ( [ eq : gamn2 ] ) , the field equations that follow from ( [ eq : f(r , q ) ] ) are @xmath218&=&0 \\label{eq : con - var}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath219 and @xmath220 .",
    "the connection equation ( [ eq : con - var ] ) can be solved in general introducing an auxiliary metric @xmath221 such that ( [ eq : con - var ] ) takes the form @xmath222=0 $ ] , which implies that @xmath223 can be written as the levi - civita connection of @xmath66 . when the matter sources are represented by a perfect fluid , @xmath224",
    ", one can show that @xmath66 and @xmath225 are given by @xcite @xmath226 where @xmath227^{1/2 } \\ , \\ \\lambda=\\sqrt{\\kappa^2 p+\\frac{f}{2}+\\frac{f_r^2}{8f_q } } \\\\ \\lambda_1&= & \\sqrt{2f_q}\\lambda+\\frac{f_r}{2 }   \\ , \\",
    "\\lambda_2= \\sqrt{2f_q}\\left[\\lambda\\pm\\sqrt{\\lambda^2-\\kappa^2(\\rho+p)}\\right ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is worth noting that ( [ eq : met - disformal ] ) implies a disformal relation between the metrics @xmath71 and @xmath66 .",
    "a relation of this form between two metrics naturally arises in bekenstein s relativistic theory @xcite of mond and in previous versions of it . in the mond theory",
    ", the vector @xmath228 is an independent dynamical vector field and the functions in front of it and in front of @xmath71 depend on another dynamical scalar field . in the theory described here , on the contrary ,",

    "the shear also takes its maximum allowed value , namely , @xmath244 , which is always finite , and the expansion vanishes producing a cosmic bounce regardless of the amount of anisotropy . the model ( [ eq : f(r , q ) ] ) , therefore , avoids the well - known problems of anisotropic universes in gr @xcite , where anisotropies grow faster than the energy density during the contraction phase leading to a singularity that can only be avoided by sources with @xmath245 .",
    "+ the evolution of inhomogeneities in the quadratic model discussed here was considered in @xcite , though the approximations used there to solve for the connection equation did not allow to see the existence of bouncing solutions .",
    "for this reason , in this case one can not make any statement regarding the evolution of inhomogeneities across the bounce .",
    "the cosmology of @xmath0 and @xmath246 theories was also considered in some detail in @xcite .",
    "the possibility of having a standard cosmological evolution in @xmath65 models with a large cosmological constant has been considered recently@xcite . +",
    "before concluding , we note that the @xmath65 theories discussed here are able to reproduce other aspects of the expected phenomenology of quantum gravity at the planck scale @xcite .",
    "in particular , without imposing any a priori phenomenological structure , the quadratic palatini model ( [ eq : f(r , q ) ] ) predicts an energy - density dependence of the metric components that closely matches the structure conjectured in models of doubly ( or deformed ) special relativity @xcite and rainbow gravity @xcite .",
    "this confirms that palatini theories represent a new and powerful framework to address different aspects of quantum gravity phenomenology .",
