    "the nature and role of defects in disordered materials is not fully understood and numerous questions remain , especially with regards to relaxation . for example , the usual definition of defects  such as vacancies and interstitials  can not be directly applied to disordered or amorphous materials : while 3- and 5-fold coordinated atoms are often taken as defect centers in , other medium - range defects , such as string of _ short _ or _ long _ bonds , might also have to be considered , as shown recently by drabold and collaborators  @xcite .",
    "we study here the role of defects with respect to relaxation by examining the response of   to plastic deformations . in crystalline materials , where the phenomenon is well understood ,",
    "plasticity is attributed to defect nucleation or dislocation motion  @xcite ; in disordered materials , the response is harder to define structurally , as demonstrated by a number of studies in systems ranging from metallic  @xcite and polymeric  @xcite glasses to granular materials  @xcite and colloids  @xcite .",
    "helder  @xcite , however , have shown that , during irradiation with high - energy heavy ions ,   deforms plastically in the same manner as conventional glasses , i.e. , defects , irradiation and plasticity are directly related in amorphous materials .",
    "it is this still imperfectly understood relation that motivates the work presented here .",
    "following initial suggestions by argon  @xcite , it has been proposed recently that plasticity is caused by collections of shear transformation zones that operate as localized centers for the deformations .",
    "@xcite in , these plastic deformations are attributed to the presence of liquid - like particles  @xcite associated to 5-fold coordinated atoms . to verify these ideas , elastic and plastic deformations in",
    "were investigated by talati  @xcite using classical md simulations based on the stillinger - weber  @xcite and the tersoff  @xcite potentials ; it was concluded that , even though the general behavior of the stress - strain curves associated with elastic and plastic deformations are similar to that for other disordered materials , details as to the nature of the defect responsible for plasticity depend on the particular potential used .",
    "we revisit this question here using classical md simulations and the environment dependent interatomic potential ( edip )  @xcite .",
    "various points defects and their effects on elastic constants have been characterized by allred  @xcite using the edip potential  @xcite .",
    "these authors have shown that the elastic constants vary in a roughly linear fashion with defect concentration up to @xmath03% , in line with experiment , suggesting that edip is suitable for investigating the elastic and plastic deformations in .",
    "our simulations were performed using the classical md package ( lammps )  @xcite .",
    "most previous studies of elastic and plastic deformations in amorphous materials have been performed at 0  k or at low temperature , with a focus on the disordering process . here",
    "we examine the situation in  by investigating the system s response to variations in shear velocity and temperature , as both parameters contribute , in their own way , in forcing the system to overcome energy barriers and explore the potential energy surface ; as mentioned previously , structural changes are strongly correlated with imposed strain  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the section  [ model ] , we describe the details of our simulation model . in the next section ( [ res ] ) , we present the results obtained by applying mechanical shear deformations at different shear velocities and temperatures . in the section  [ structure",
    "] , we present the structural analysis as a function of shear velocity .",
    "after discussion ( section  [ discussion ] ) of our results , we will give our main conclusions ( section  [ conclude ] ) .",
    "classical md simulations have limitations , but they are unavoidable to simulate systems large enough to limit the impact of size effects . for the problem at hand , charges and electronic effect should not play a direct role and therefore a description in terms of suitable classical interactions",
    "is appropriate .",
    "the edip functional form involves a two - body radial term for bond - stretching interactions and a three - body angular term for bond - bending interactions , and each of these depends strongly on an effective coordination number @xmath1 .",
    "we have chosen this potential for its ability to reproduce a wide range of zero - temperature properties of si , including elastic constants , bulk crystal structures and point defects  @xcite  in particular , edip describes accurately the vacancy formation energy .",
    "this potential has been used to study the ion - beam induced amorphization of crystalline silicon  @xcite and the crystallization  @xcite of  starting from amorphous - crystalline interfaces  @xcite .",
    "the melting temperature of crystalline silicon obtained using edip is 1500  k and it is 1200  k for . in both cases , this is roughly 200  k below experimental values ( 1685  k and 1420  k , respectively  @xcite ) .",
    "both phases are therefore stable or , at least , metastable in the temperature range investigated here .",
    "experimentally ,   can be obtained by laser - melting and quenching , by chemical vapor deposition  @xcite , or by ion - irradiation  @xcite .",
    "numerically , our models of  are generated using the modified wooten - winer - weaire ( www ) bond - switching algorithm , which can produce perfect 4-fold - coordinated random networks  @xcite in good structural and electronic agreement with experiments  @xcite .",
    "a 1000-atom   cell was first constructed , then duplicated in order to obtain a cubic box containing 8000 atoms .",
    "the latter was then annealed in the npt ensemble with periodic boundary conditions over 150  ns at 300  k so as to obtain a well relaxed models of amorphous silicon .",
    "the final structure was found to contain less than 3% of defects ( mostly 5-fold coordinated atoms ) , the rest being perfectly 4-fold coordinated , in agreement with the best finite - temperature models available in the literature .",
    "the mechanical shear deformations on the 8000-atom  model are introduced as follows : the cell is first equilibrated ( at the target temperature  see below ) with periodic boundary conditions in all three directions , for at least 5  ns .",
    "three different regions are then defined , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figsnapshear ] : an upper and a lower `` wall '' , each containing 1000 atoms , and a region of mobile or active particles ; periodic boundary conditions are now imposed only in the lateral ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) directions , while surface atoms are fixed in the @xmath4-direction .",
    "this procedure is similar to that used by mokshin  @xcite on single - component lennard - jones amorphous systems .",
    "the thickness of the walls , about 6  , is larger than the edip cutoff  @xcite , thus ensuring that all particles within the active region ( 40  -thick ) share the same physics .",
    "the mechanical shear deformations are generated by moving the walls at fixed shear velocity ( shear rate ) @xmath5 along the shear direction ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the shear velocity ( @xmath5 ) measures the speed of the deformation while the strain rate ( @xmath6 ) gives the change in strain with respect to time and it corresponds to the shear velocity devided by the distance between the walls . in practice ,",
    "the lower - wall position is fixed and only the particles in the upper wall are moved by imposing a constant displacement @xmath7 at every timestep @xmath8 ( 1  fs )  the wall particles are otherwise frozen in place .",
    "the amorphous nature of the walls ensures that crystal growth , if it occurs , is not induced by the boundaries as in the case of crystallization studies using amorphous - crystalline interfaces  @xcite .",
    "note that the cell is aged during 1  ns before applying the deformations in order to ensure proper relaxation after releasing the periodic boundary conditions along @xmath4 .",
    "the equations of motion for mobile particles are integrated using the velocity verlet algorithm . since an additional force",
    "is imposed in the shear direction ( @xmath2 ) , only the components in the `` neutral '' @xmath4 and @xmath3 directions are considered for computing and rescaling the velocities to constant temperature during the deformation process .",
    "the pressure at time @xmath9 is computed from instantaneous atomic positions [ @xmath10 , @xmath11 and forces acting on the particles [ @xmath12 , @xmath11 using @xmath13 , with @xmath14 the number of particles , @xmath15 the volume , @xmath16 the temperature , and @xmath17 boltzmann s constant .",
    "statistics such as potential energy and coordination number were obtained at zero shear velocity and will be used as reference for assessing the effect of the shear deformations .",
    "the elastic and plastic deformations of materials are usually analyzed in terms of stress - strain curves  @xcite where the strain corresponds to the maximum displacement in the shear direction with respect to the distance between the two walls , which is kept constant .",
    "we prefer to characterize the deformations in terms of the potential energy difference ( ped ) @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the potential energies of sheared and non - sheared systems ; @xmath20 is computed before switching on the shear deformations .",
    "this analysis has the advantage of providing direct microscopic information and relates more readily to structural changes during shearing .",
    "structural properties like radial distribution functions and the coordination number will also be used to determine how the properties of  are affected by mechanical shear deformations .",
    "in this section , we examine the effects of varying the shear velocity and the temperature on the system s structural disorder and defect concentration .",
    "we fix the temperature at 300  k and vary @xmath5 between @xmath21 and @xmath22  . for all values of @xmath5 but the smallest",
    ", simulations are run until a strain of 20% is reached ; e.g. , for a shear velocity of @xmath23  , the simulation time is 0.8  ns . for the lowest shear velocity ( @xmath24  ) , because of computational limitations , we stopped at 12% strain , corresponding to a simulation time of 500  ns . in all cases ,",
    "simulations are long enough for the plastic deformation threshold  defined by the onset of irreversible deformations  to be reached ; this occurs in   at a strain of about 10% .",
    "the exact value of this threshold depends on the shear velocity and we found it to increase with @xmath5 , in agreement with previous results ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , for example ) .",
    "it is well known that stress appears immediately following a shear deformation . at short times or small strain values ,",
    "the stress increases almost linearly and saturates at high strain values .",
    "this constant stress corresponds to the sheared steady - state character of plastic deformations .",
    "this general behavior is common for polymeric materials  @xcite , metallic glasses  @xcite , colloids  @xcite and amorphous materials  @xcite .",
    "the response of the system to mechanical shear deformations can be analyzed , in general , in terms of stress - strain curves  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , we prefer to use the ped between sheared and non - sheared cells , as it provides a direct and simple description of the microscopic structural deformations that take place under shear deformations .",
    "figure  [ figepotpressshear300 ] shows ( a ) @xmath25 , ( b ) the internal pressure as a function of strain for different shear velocities and ( c ) @xmath25 higher strain values using a shear velocity of @xmath22  ( arrows indicate the direction of increasing shear velocity ) . evidently , changes in the potential energy are a manifestation of structural rearrangements that have taken place with respect to the initial , unstrained model . thus , mechanical shear  and therefore strain  increases the potential energy , i.e. , the disorder , of the system ( cf .",
    "also ivashchenko  @xcite ) .",
    "changes in the potential energy as a function of shear take place over two different regimes . for small shears , a quadratic behaviour is observed , associated with elastic and reversible deformations ; the quadratic nature of the energy is independent of the rate at which the strain is applied , as one can see from the overlap of the curves corresponding to different shear velocities .",
    "the point at which the system crosses over to the second , high - strain regime , however , does depend on @xmath5 ; the larger @xmath5 , the longer the elastic regime persists .",
    "this behavior is perfectly echoed in the pressure  a larger @xmath5 allows the system to reach a much higher negative pressure before plastic deformations are forced .",
    "the potential - energy maximum also corresponds to a stress maximum in the stress - strain curves or the yield stress ( not shown ) .",
    "this behavior is common for elastic and plastic deformations of polymeric  @xcite , metallic glasses  @xcite , and amorphous materials  @xcite .",
    "the onset of plastic deformations is characterized by an overall relaxation of the system , as we observe in fig .",
    "[ figepotpressshear300](a ) . the higher the yield stress ( defined by the pressure , for example ) , the larger the relaxation ; for the smallest @xmath5 , @xmath21  , for example , there is very little relaxation after the plastic deformation peak is reached .",
    "we note however that , after an initial drop , the potential energy increases again , but at a relatively slow rate .",
    "it would eventually saturate to a steady - state level , beyond the reach of our simulations , which corresponds to the plasticity regime associated with a flowing steady state , as one can see in fig .",
    "[ figepotpressshear300](c ) . in this simulation ,",
    "performed with a significantly faster shear velocity , the potential energy saturates within the run time indicating that the system has reached the flowing steady state and therefore its maximum disorder .",
    "the inset of this figure shows the details for strain values up to 1.0 .",
    "for all shear velocities considered here , the mean value of the potential energy in the plastic steady state is higher than its value before shear deformations are applied . in other terms",
    ", the system exhibits an irreversible plastic deformation leading to increased internal strain as in the case of metallic and silica glasses under high energy irradiation  @xcite . as for irradiation , the mechanical shear",
    "deformations lead to the formation of new defects in ; this will be discussed in the section [ defectssec ] .    in the case of plastic deformations , the mean value of the steady - state potential energy increases with @xmath5 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figepotpressshear300](a )  the curves for different values of @xmath5 are almost parallel , shifted to lower energies for smaller shear velocities . in all cases ,",
    "we observe a drop in the potential energy after the crossover from elastic to plastic deformations .",
    "this suggests that , at this point , the system has to overcome an energy barrier to launch a relaxation cascade .",
    "the height of this barrier decreases with increasing shear , and the probability of crossing it at lower strain increases for systems under slower shear rates , explaining the observed behavior . because of the boltzmann factor governing the jump rate , the transition is also be pushed to lower strain values with increasing temperature .",
    "for example , the minimum strain value is found to lie between @xmath02% for the lowest shear velocity and @xmath08% for the highest in our 300  k runs while , according to talati  @xcite , it can reach 20% at 0  k. clearly , temperature plays an important role on the yield - stress value .    at 300  k ,",
    "the ped between sheared and annealed  is about 0.02  ev / atom for @xmath24  and 0.08  ev / atom for @xmath26  : evidently , the structural changes taking place in  are strongly correlated to the applied shear velocity . while it was not possible to apply a slower strain rate ,",
    "these results suggest that the steady - state ped from the annealed state would tend to zero as the strain rate decreases .",
    "this question will be discussed in more details in section [ discussion ] .",
    "the shear - induced disorder leads to the formation of higher - density regions associated with higher - coordinated , `` liquid - like '' particles .",
    "this would explain the increase in amplitude of the negative pressure observed in fig .",
    "[ figepotpressshear300](b ) for different shear velocities . for very small strain , the pressure decreases harmonically and reaches a minimum before settling to a steady - state value associated with the plastic - deformation regime , which is strain independent ( as in the case of the ped ) . for larger strain ,",
    "the pressure does depend on the shear velocity : the change is 2  gpa for @xmath27  , while it is only 1  gpa for @xmath28  .",
    "the plastic deformations are accompanied by a noticeable drop in the pressure amplitude  @xcite.this behaviour does not appear to be caused solely by the unusual phase diagram of silicon , where the liquid is denser than the solid , as it is also observed in metallic glasses and is rather due the concentration of defects observed in the plastic regime ( see below ) .",

    "in agreement with the results observed on stress - strain curves of the elastic and plastic deformations of different materials  @xcite , the system s response to strain can divided into three regimes . at low strain , the system responds with strain - independent elastic deformations , as observed in the ped and the pressure , for example . although the number of local defects , here over - coordinated atoms , increases during this phase , a large fraction of these are reversible .",
    "the second regime , at intermediate strain , depends on the shear velocity and is associated with the elastic to plastic transition . here ,",
    "the absolute values of the ped and the pressure reach a maximum , then fall off to smaller values following a cascade of bond rearrangements that reduces the strain buildup , the drop being larger for faster shear rates and lower temperatures .",
    "surprisingly , however , this is not accompanied by a similar drop in the number of defects .",
    "as the energy is released , the defects are therefore stabilized by irreversible atomic repositioning .",
    "the third regime corresponds to steady - state plastic deformations and occurs at high strain values . in this regime ,",
    "the various microscopic and thermodynamic quantities are essentially strain - independent . for the pressure ,",
    "the plastic regime rapidly reaches a plateau after the break - down . for the potential energy ,",
    "the convergence is somewhat slower and the steady - state value is only slightly lower than the maximum at the elastic - to - plastic transition .",
    "the curves are also shifted to lower energies with decreasing shear velocity or increasing temperature  @xcite .",
    "this contrasts with the microscopic density of 5-fold defects , which shows a steady increase and is not yet converged for most values of the shear velocity and temperature at a strain of 0.2 .",
    "our results on the effects of shear and temperature allow us to better characterize the spatial inhomogeneities involved in the response to shear .",
    "while defects form almost uniformly across the atomic layers in the elastic phase , plastic deformations are concentrated within a narrow region near the center of the box at low temperatures and high shear rates , and the fraction of liquid - like 5-fold coordinated atoms in these layers reaches almost 40% , in line with the results of refs .",
    "indeed , the cell is breaking into two parts with an almost fluid interface between them .",
    "such a sharp break is costly however and is imposed by kinetic considerations : the relaxation time is too short to permit a global response of the system to the external perturbation . the system is , in effect , frozen , and stress",
    "can build up significantly , which can only be released by a size - wide rearrangement , creating the observed sharp break .",
    "this inhomogeneity explains why the radial distribution function is only slightly affected by an average defect concentration of more than 20% .    as the temperature rises or the shear velocity decreases , the relaxation time becomes comparable with the shear rate and the response to perturbation is spread to larger and larger regions , preventing a large build - up characterized by a significant increase in potential energy or defect concentration .",
    "and while 5-fold coordinated atoms remain the main type of defects by which this response takes place , it is no longer possible to speak of localized centers of deformation , since the whole system is affected in the plastic regime .",
    "the relation between temperature and shear velocity can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figloglog ] which shows the evolution of the maximum ped and the mean value of the ped in the plastic deformation regime as a function of shear velocity and temperature ; the data are extracted from figs .",
    "[ figepotpressshear300 ] and  [ figepottemp ] . for the ped ,",
    "we observe almost the same power - law relation between the shear - velocity and the energy at the yield - stress and in the steady state plastic regime , in both cases with an exponent of @xmath37 in a wide range of shear velocities between @xmath35  and @xmath22  .",
    "for the smallest shear velocity , the power - law relation seems to be less reliable and the effects of shear appear to be more important than could be expected . since thermal effects are included in the reference potential energy , this suggests that there is no critical rate for which thermal energy completely obliterates the effects of shearing even though plasticity will spread to always larger fractions of the system .    in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ figloglog ] , a similar power - law behavior is observed for temperatures between 150  k and 900  k , with an exponent of @xmath380.9 . again , even at high temperature ( but below melting ) , the effects of shear are not fully compensated but are strongly reduced . at low temperature , the power - law relation breaks down because the bonding energy introduces a hard threshold on the amount of strain that can be stored in the system .    ) .",
    "the inset on the panel ( b ) shows the same curve in a linear scale.,title=\"fig : \" ]  ) .",
    "the inset on the panel ( b ) shows the same curve in a linear scale.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the origin of these power - law relations can be related to the energy landscape structure of the system . because the activation energy necessary to cross a barrier is uncorrelated with the energy difference between the top of the barrier and the final minimum , only the shape of the forward activation - energy barrier distribution is important  @xcite . from numerical calculations",
    "@xcite , it is known that this activation - energy barrier distribution at @xmath39  k is a continuous function that can be fitted to : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the barrier energy , @xmath42 a normalisation factor , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 two parameters that depend on the system and the degree of relaxation .",
    "at finite temperature , for a well - relaxed sample , barriers below @xmath45 are already _ consumed_. the shearing here effectively increases the system s energy , thus decreasing the height of available barriers , and , from there , increases the crossing probability at a given temperature . because energy barriers of any height may exist , it is possible for the system to accommodate shearing at least partially , at any temperature , as long as the shearing rate is slow with respect to the attempt - to - jump frequency .",
    "we have investigated the properties of amorphous silicon subject to external mechanical shear deformations using classical md simulations with the environment dependent inter - atomic potential ( edip ) .",
    "the shear deformations are introduced by moving one wall in the shear direction  @xcite .",
    "we find that both energetic and structural properties of the system depend strongly on the shear velocity and the imposed strain , as well as the temperature at which the deformations are applied . at low temperatures and for all",
    "shear velocities investigated , we observe a systematic increase in disorder associated with an increase in the fraction of coordination defects , in agreement with the results of the references  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the shear - induced energy can be written in terms of a power - law of both temperature and shear velocity : @xmath46 , with @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "finally , we observe a very strong dependence of the spatial distribution of defects on these two quantities . for low temperatures or high shear velocities , defects are localized in a narrow region in the middle of the cell .",
    "as the temperature increases or the shear rate slows down , this region becomes wider until it covers the whole system .",
    "this effect is due to the existence of a continuous distribution of activation energy barriers that allows the system to relax at any temperature provided that it has ample time to do so , as determined by the shear rate .",
