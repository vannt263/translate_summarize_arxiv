    "one of the early goals of heavy - ion collisions at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is to establish the existence of a new state of matter which is called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) [ 1 ] . according to lattice quantum chromodynamics calculations ( qcd ) , the theory of strong interactions ,",
    "qgp occurs when a sufficiently high temperature and high energy density ( @xmath4 gev/@xmath5 ) is reached .",
    "the partonic system is transformed into hadronic matter as the system cools to lower temperatures .",
    "the phase diagram of qcd is in general characterized by two quantities , the temperature ( t ) and the baryon chemical potential ( @xmath6 ) or the ( net ) baryon density ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the phase diagram should contain information about the phase boundary that separates the qgp and hadronic phases [ 2 ] .",
    "lattice qcd finds a rapid , but smooth crossover transition from hadron gas to qgp at vanishing baryon chemical potential and large temperature t , while various models predict a strong , first - order phase transition at large @xmath6 .",
    "if this is the case , then there should be a critical point at intermediate values in the ( t , @xmath6 ) plane where the transition changes from a smooth crossover to a first order [ 3 ] .",
    "the bes program at rhic is carried out using several center - of - mass energies of colliding nuclei , to explore the above aspects of this qcd phase diagram .",
    "+ the constituents of the hot and dense medium produced during a heavy - ion collision interact with each other by inelastic and elastic collisions and it evolves into a state of free particles .",
    "this process of hadron decoupling is called freeze - out .",
    "two kinds of freeze - out are found : chemical freeze - out ( t@xmath8 ) when inelastic collisions cease and the particle yields become fixed ; thermal ( kinetic ) freeze - out ( t@xmath9 ) when elastic collisions cease and particle transverse momenta ( @xmath1 ) spectra get fixed .",
    "+ we present a study of the centrality dependence of hadronic freeze - out parameters in au+au collisions at mid - rapidity for @xmath10 7.7 , 11.5 , and 39 gev measured by the star experiment . to extract chemical freeze - out parameters we use a statistical thermal model ( thermus ) [ 5 ] where we fit experimental particle ratios using a grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) approach with the inclusion of a strangeness saturation factor ( @xmath11 ) and also with strangeness canonical ensemble ( sce ) where strangeness quantum number is conserved exactly . in this study",
    "we have used mid - rapidity particle ratios that include the pions ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) , kaons ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) , protons ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 , lambdas ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) and cascades ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) [ 6 , 7 ] .",
    "the chemical freeze - out parameters extracted are t@xmath8 , @xmath6 , @xmath23 and @xmath11 .",
    "the kinetic freeze - out parameters are determined from the blast - wave model ( bw ) [ 8 ] fits to the @xmath1 spectra of @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath16 [ 6 ] .",
    "the main kinetic freeze - out parameters extracted are t@xmath9 and average flow velocity ( @xmath26 ) .",

    "the new measurement at bes energies 7.7 , 11.5 , and 39 gev at rhic extends the @xmath27 range from 20 to 400 mev in the qcd phase diagram .",
    "kinetic freeze - out parameters are obtained using the measured particle spectra and a bw model .",
    "for all the beam energies studied , the central collisions are characterized by a lower t@xmath9 and larger @xmath26 while the peripheral collisions are found to have a higher t@xmath9 and smaller @xmath26 .",
    "chemical freeze - out parameters are obtained using the measured particle ratios and a thermus model .",
    "we have observed a centrality dependence of the chemical freeze - out parameters at the lower energies . we have observed different behavior of chemical freeze - out parameters ( t@xmath8 , @xmath27 ) for peripheral collisions in gce and sce .",
