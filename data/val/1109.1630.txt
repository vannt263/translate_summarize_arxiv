    "one of the most interesting results coming from rhic heavy ion program is the observation that hot qcd matter created in au - au collisions behaves like an almost ideal fluid @xcite .",
    "relativistic hydrodynamics has been a successful theory to describe the bulk properties of the qcd medium produced in nuclear collision .",
    "hydrodynamic simulation of nuclear collision at rhic indicates that the shear viscosity of qcd plasma is very small .",
    "however the extracted value of shear viscosity largely depend on the initial condition @xcite .",
    "the theoretical estimation of various kinetic coefficient for a qcd plasma becomes enormously complex due to strong coupling .",
    "string theoretical calculation based on the ads / cft correspondence predicts a lower limit on the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density as @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the bulk viscosity @xmath6 can in general be of the same order of magnitude as shear viscosity @xmath7 .",
    "but until recently , the bulk viscosity was neglected in the study of fluid dynamics of qcd matter .",
    "there are important special cases in which @xmath6 is very much smaller , or vanishes altogether @xcite . in @xcite author",
    "shows that a simple gas of structureless point particles will have negligible bulk viscosity in the extreme - relativistic or non relativistic limits .",
    "however , it must be stressed that a vanishing bulk viscosity is the exception , rather than the rule , for general imperfect fluids @xcite,@xcite .",
    "existence of non zero bulk viscosity in qcd plasma near the critical temperature was reported in @xcite from lattice qcd calculation . the theoretical estimation for transport coefficients in qcd plasma",
    "can also be found in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "a lower and upper bound of shear viscosity was given and bulk viscosity associated with the plasma to hadron transition was estimated in the relaxation- time approximation .",
    "several sources of shear and bulk viscosity was discussed in  @xcite with the emphasis that the bulk viscosity is associated with the chemical nonequilibrium .",
    "the effect of bulk viscosity on freezeout and hbt puzzle was studied in @xcite . in spite of all these theoretical calculations ,",
    "there are several model dependency in the estimate of the transport coefficients .",
    "one can introduce the dissipative effects in hydrodynamics by treating transport coefficient like shear and bulk viscosity as input parameter and obtain their values in phenomenological study by comparing to the experimental data . in the following ,",
    "we will consider effect of bulk viscosity on hydrodynamic evolution and subsequent particle production .",

    "we will describe in detail the results obtained from the recently extended version of our code by considering two different temperature dependent forms of @xmath2 and a constant @xmath3 .",
    "in addition to shear viscous correction to freezeout distribution function we have also considered the bulk viscous correction to the ideal freezeout distribution function .",
    "the bulk viscous correction @xmath11 was calculated by using grad s 14-moment method for a multicomponent gas as discussed in @xcite .",
    "considering a small value of bulk stress @xmath12 at the freezeout it was shown in @xcite that bulk viscosity has a non - negligible effect on particle spectra and elliptic flow coefficient .",
    "thus it is important to consider the bulk viscous evolution and the dissipative correction to the ideal freezeout distribution function .",
    "we will concentrate in this work to study the effect of bulk viscosity on @xmath13 spectra and elliptic flow of charged hadron with for two different freezeout temperature @xmath14=130 and 160 mev .",
    "we want to remind that the calculation of @xmath11 for a multicomponent hadron gas is non trivial , for a recent calculation of the dissipative correction @xmath15 to the single particle distribution function in leading - log qcd and in several simplified model see @xcite .",

    "we start with the brief description of the formalism which is followed by a detail discussion on implementing bulk viscosity in the fluid evolution as well as the corresponding dissipative correction to the freezeout distribution function .    for a simple fluid in equilibrium or in adiabatic limit , the energy momentum tensor @xmath19 and particle current @xmath20 has the following forms @xcite    @xmath21    where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are total energy density , pressure , and particle number density .",
