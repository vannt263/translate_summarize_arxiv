    "the formation of stars from the interstellar medium ( ism ) of galactic disks is one of the basic processes that controls the evolution of galaxies .",
    "most stellar populations are built - up in this way , including those in typical milky way - like disk galaxies , as well as those formed in starbursts due to galactic interactions that drive large quantities of the ism gas to more compact circumnuclear disks .",
    "understanding the star formation rate ( sfr ) per unit area , @xmath1 , from a given galactic disk system as characterized by its total gas mass per unit area , @xmath2 , is thus a basic challenge to theoretical models of star formation and galaxy evolution .",
    "empirically , there is a well - established correlation of @xmath3 ( kennicutt 1998 ) . considering only the mass surface density of molecular gas , @xmath4 ,",
    "a linear relation @xmath5 has been derived ( leroy et al .",
    "2008 ; bigiel et al .",
    "these sfrs are of relatively low efficiency : only about 4% percent of the total gas content in a given annulus is turned into stars per local orbital time ( e.g. , leroy et al . 2008 ; tan 2010 ) .",
    "zooming in to the scales where stars actually form , the majority are born in very localized , @xmath6parsec - scale clumps , i.e. , proto star clusters , within turbulent , magnetized giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , which are themselves @xmath7  pc in size ( mckee & ostriker 2007 ) .",
    "the inefficiency of star formation continues down to these scales : only a few percent of gmc and clump gas forms stars per local free - fall time ( krumholz & tan 2007 ; da rio et al .",
    "2014 ) .    the physics of the star formation process",
    "is expected to involve a competition between gravitational collapse and various forms of pressure support in the gmcs and their clumps ( e.g. , thermal , turbulent , magnetic , radiation ) . however , thermal pressure is relatively unimportant at the @xmath8  k temperatures of most gmc material .",
    "the inefficiency of observed sfrs in gmcs implies that some combination of turbulence , magnetic fields and feedback is playing a crucial role in regulating sfrs , making the rates much smaller than those that would result from unsupported , free - fall collapse of the clouds .",
    "however , the relative importance of these inhibiting factors remains very uncertain . on the theoretical side , this is because numerical simulations of the ism and star formation are challenging due to the large range of scales that must be followed , the uncertain choices that need to be made when specifying initial conditions , and the wide variety of physical processes that must be considered . in this paper",
    "we present numerical simulations that explore star formation in galactic disks , focussing on the role of feedback in regulating the ism and star formation activity .",
    "this is the fourth in a series of papers describing 3d simulations of a 1  kpc@xmath9 patch of a galactic disk extracted from the global galaxy simulation of tasker & tan ( 2009 ) . in van loo , butler & tan ( 2013 , paper i ) ,",
    "we followed the patch for 10 myr down to a resolution of 0.5  pc .",
    "star formation was included , with star particles with a minimum mass of 100  @xmath10 forming in gas above a density threshold of @xmath11 at a star formation efficiency per local free - fall time of @xmath12 . no feedback processes aside from a constant @xmath13 fuv field",
    "were included , and after 10 myr we observed star formation rate surface densities @xmath14 times higher than those in galaxies of comparable gas mass surface density ( e.g. , bigiel et al .",
    "in paper i we speculated that this was due to a lack of magnetic fields and/or local feedback from young stars .",
    "in van loo , tan & falle ( 2015 , paper ii ) we explored the effects of magnetic fields of varying strength on the same kpc - scale patch of the tasker & tan ( 2009 ) galactic disk .",
    "here we found that magnetic fields suppressed the overall star formation rates by up to a factor of two ; however , this result was strongly influenced by the presence of a magnetically supercritical starburst region .",
    "in other regions , larger suppression rates were observed .    in butler , tan & van loo ( 2015 , paper iii )",
    ", we followed the kpc - scale patch down to much higher resolution ( @xmath15  pc ) for 4 myr .",
    "star formation was included with the same recipe as in papers i and ii , but now with a higher density threshold of @xmath16 and a minimum star particle mass of 10 @xmath10 . as in paper",
    "i , we did not include magnetic fields or feedback from star particles .",
    "enabled by our higher resolution , we explored the structural , kinematic and dynamical properties of the large filaments and clumps and compared them , when possible , to observations of infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) and long molecular filaments that have been identified in the galactic plane .",
    "we found that by many metrics , including too high dense ( @xmath17  @xmath18",
    "@xmath19 ) gas mass fractions , too high mass per unit length dispersion and velocity gradients along the filaments , and too high velocity dispersion for a given mass per unit length , our simulated filaments and clumps differ greatly compared to observed clouds .",
    "we therefore concluded that irdcs do not form from global fast collapse of gmcs , but rather we expect them to be strongly influenced by dynamically important magnetic fields .",
    "the important features that distinguish the simulations of this current paper ( paper iv ) from previous works are : ( 1 ) the inclusion of dissociating and ionizing feedback , in combination with supernova feedback ; ( 2 ) the adopted simulation set - up that is inherited from a shearing , global disk simulation ; ( 3 ) the high dynamic range from 1 kiloparsec down to 0.5 parsecs ; ( 4 ) the high , realistic density threshold for initiating star formation of @xmath20 and the requirement that this gas be mostly molecular ; ( 5 ) the use of a star formation efficiency per local free - fall time of 2% .",
    "these features of the star formation sub - grid model are motivated by observational studies of star - forming molecular clouds ( e.g. , zuckerman & evans 1974 ; krumholz & tan 2007 ; tan et al .",
    "2014 ; da rio et al .",
    "they are an approximate attempt to account for the regulation of star formation rates by a combination of turbulence and magnetic fields operating on sub - grid scales . by comparison , walch et al .",
    "( 2015 ) presented simulations of a 500  pc sized patch of a non - shearing disk with fiducial resolution of about 4  pc , studying only localized feedback from supernova , although in a background uv radiation field .",
    "kim et al . ( 2013 ) simulated a shearing 512  pc sized patch of disk down to 2  pc resolution to study star formation from `` dense '' gas ( @xmath21 ) and subsequent momentum injection from sn feedback .",
    "kim & ostriker ( 2015 ) included the effects of magnetic fields , finding only modest reductions in sfrs of  25% .",
    "on larger scales , hopkins et al .",
    "( 2012 ) have presented smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations of galaxies with up to sub - pc resolution in which stars form when @xmath22 and including momentum feedback representing stellar winds , radiation pressure and supernovae , and an approximate strmgren - type model for ionization feedback .",
    "however , the sph method has been criticized for being very diffusive and for having difficulties of accurately modeling the multi - phase ism that is expected in regions affected by strong feedback ( agertz et al . 2007 ) .",
    "agertz & kratsov ( 2015 ) have simulated a global disk galaxy with a cosmological zoom - in grid - based amr simulation that includes energy and momentum feedback from winds , radiation pressure and supernova feedback , but with resolution of only 75  pc .",
    "the treatment of radiative transfer in the above simulations has generally been very approximate in comparison to the moment based method we utilize here .",
    "rosdahl et al .",
    "( 2015 ) have presented global galaxy simulations including photo - ionization , radiation pressure and supernova feedback , but with minimum resolutions of about 20  pc , still too small to resolve gmcs .",
    "photodissociation feedback with a moment based method of radiative transfer has not been included in any of the above simulations .",
    "our approach is to focus on a kiloparsec - sized patch of a typical galactic disk , extended vertically also by a kiloparsec ( i.e. , to 500  pc either side of the disk midplane ) , with a flat , i.e. , constant , rotation curve of 200  @xmath23 circular velocity .",
    "the center of the patch is at a galactocentric radius of 4.25  kpc .",
    "this kpc - sized region is large enough to be sensitive to the main effects of galactic dynamics , including the shear flow due to differential rotation and the vertical structure of the disk . at the same time",
    "the region is small enough that it is practical to have resolution down to 0.5-parsec scales that can resolve gmcs . for initial conditions ,",
    "we adopt a structured ism with average gas content of @xmath24 that was extracted from a lower , 8  pc , resolution global galaxy simulation ( tasker & tan 2009 ) , which already formed a population of gmcs .",
    "these initial conditions are shown in the left columns of figures  [ fig : f1 ] and [ fig : f2 ] , which display top - down and in - plane views of the simulation volume .",
    "@xmath25{fig1.eps }   \\end{array}$ ]    @xmath26{fig2.eps }   \\end{array}$ ]    using the adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) radiation - hydrodynamics code ramses - rt ( rosdahl et al .",
    "2013 ) , we have included several physical processes in the simulations , especially : heating and cooling of molecular , atomic and ionized gas ; star formation from dense ( @xmath27 ) , molecular ( @xmath28 ) gas , i.e. , the creation of `` star particles '' that each represents a small cluster of stars of 100  @xmath29 , with average feedback properties assessed by assuming a standard chabrier ( 2003 ) stellar initial mass function ( imf ) ; and several feedback mechanisms from these newly - formed stars . in particular , we explore the effects of three types of stellar feedback : h@xmath30 dissociation by lyman - werner ( lw ) band ultraviolet photons , photoionzation of hydrogen by extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) photons that have @xmath31  ev energies , and supernovae , i.e. , the explosive death of massive stars that occurs 3  myr after their formation leading to release of @xmath32  ergs of kinetic energy .",
    "the radiation from the stars is propagated on the amr grid using a first - order godunov method , using the moment - based m1 approximation for the eddington tensor .",
    "the primary advantage of this method is that it is independent of the number of radiation sources , allowing us to study the effects of feedback from many thousands of star particles .",
    "as discussed above , the same initial conditions have also been simulated previously with two other amr simulation codes : _ enzo _ ( bryan et al . 2014 ) for the case of pure hydrodynamics with no direct stellar feedback , but including the effect of a diffuse background fuv radiation field ( van loo , butler & tan 2013 ; butler , tan & van loo 2015 ) ; and _ mg _ ( falle et al .",
    "2012 ) for the case of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) , but with no direct feedback ( van loo , tan & falle 2015 ) . thus we are able to compare our results with those of these previous simulations to examine the relative importance of magnetic fields and feedback .",
    "the simulations contain four levels of amr on top of the root grid resolution of 7.8 pc ( i.e. , @xmath33 over the kpc@xmath34 volume ) , reaching a minimum cell size of 0.49 pc at the finest level ( i.e. , equivalent to the resolution of a 2048@xmath34 uniform grid simulation ) .",
    "cells are refined when the total mass within exceeds 800 m@xmath35 .",
    "for example , on refinement to the finest level , this corresponds to a density in a 1  pc sized cell of @xmath36 , which is insufficient to resolve the jeans length for temperatures that may be as low as @xmath37k . as with previous papers in this series ,",
    "the primary goal is not to be able to properly resolve the details of gravitational fragmentation in any particular gmc , but rather to have an approximate estimate of the locations and mass fractions of gas that reach densities of @xmath38 that are necessary for star formation .",
    "we evolve the simulations for 20  myr , first with an `` initial feedback model '' until 5  myr , and then with a variety of different feedback implementations from 5 to 20  myr .",
    "as described below , the goal of the initial feedback model , which has reduced fuv feedback , is to mitigate the effects of the initial transient burst of star formation that depends on adopted initial conditions .    in the following subsections",
    ", we describe the main physical processes that have been included in the simulation code .",
    "we utilize a sub - grid model for star formation in which gas is converted , stochastically , into star particles at a fixed efficiency @xmath39 per free - fall time , if a cell exceeds a given threshold density , @xmath40 and molecular hydrogen mass fraction of @xmath41 .",
    "this choice of @xmath42 is motivated by the empirical results of krumholz & tan ( 2007 ) and is the same value used in the simulations of van loo et al .",
    "( 2015 ; 2013 ) .",
    "the choice of @xmath43 is also motivated by observations of local star - forming clouds , especially infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) , which can achieve these densities , while remaining mostly starless ( butler & tan 2012 ; tan et al .",
    "the choice of @xmath43 is also the same as that used in the simulations of van loo et al .",
    "( 2013 ; 2015 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath44 is motivated by the fact that , empirically , star formation is seen to occur exclusively in molecular clouds .",
    "physically , the reason for this may be that this allows cooling to low temperatures of @xmath45k , helped by co line cooling , which then allows dense , supersonically turbulent gas clumps to form .",
    "their relatively low ionization fractions and turbulent conditions may be crucial for mediating the loss of magnetic flux support from the gas , e.g. , by turbulent reconnection ( lazarian & vishniac 1999 ; eyink et al .",
    "star formation is then modeled by creation of `` star particles '' that are intended to represent a small cluster of young stars . on their creation , the equivalent mass is removed instantaneously from the gas in the relevant cell .",
    "the star particles only feel gravitational forces from the surrounding gas and the background galactic potential . also , they do not accrete any material once formed .",
    "we adopt a minimum star particle mass of @xmath46 , with this choice being motivated by the minimum gas mass that is present in a star - forming 0.5  pc - sized cell of @xmath47 , given the choice of @xmath40 .",
    "in typical simulation time steps , the mass of new young stars that should form is much less than @xmath46 , so a star particle is only formed with a probability that yields an overall , time - averaged sfr equal to that set by the choice of @xmath39 . thus all star particles in the simulations",
    "are in fact born with masses of @xmath46 and when they are formed , the mass of gas in the natal cell undergoes at most a @xmath48 change .",
    "the star particles are then sources of feedback on the surrounding gas .",
    "the feedback properties are based on that expected from a stellar population with initial masses distributed according to the chabrier ( 2003 ) imf with upper and lower mass limits of 120 @xmath29 and 0.1 @xmath29 . in reality",
    ", one expects stochastic sampling of the upper end of the imf , but this effect is not included here .",
    "we anticipate that it would make only minor differences due to the large number of star particles that are formed in the simulations .",
    "thus we utilize imf - averaged stellar evolutionary tracks from bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) that follow evolution from the zero age main sequence to later stages ( see rosdahl et al .",
    "2015 for more details ) .    in this study ,",
    "our primary focus is to investigate the thermal and chemical feedback due to uv radiation .",
    "thus the fuv radiation field is constructed , which induces photoelectric heating feedback .",
    "it also leads to dissociation of h@xmath49 .",
    "the euv radiation field leads to ionization of h , with the ionized gas heated to near @xmath50k .",
    "the elevated thermal pressure of these hii regions is another form of feedback .",
    "the radiative transfer methods necessary to model this feedback are described below , while the types of radiation feedback are summarized in table  [ tab : rt ] .",
    "note , in this work , we have not modeled the effects of radiation pressure feedback , which is deferred to a future study ( rosdahl et al .",
    ", in prep . ) . nor",
    "have we modeled the momentum input from stellar wind feedback , which is difficult to resolve on the scales followed here , especially the effects of overlapping wind bubbles from individual stars , which will lead to a reduction in the overall momentum injection due to oppositely directed flows .",
    "supernova feedback is modelled with a single injection from each star particle ( of total mass @xmath51 ) into its host cell 3  myr after the particle is formed of ejecta mass @xmath52 and thermal energy @xmath53 .",
    "we choose a value of @xmath54 , resulting in each star particle injecting the energy and mass expected from a single supernova projenitor star of initial mass of approximately 10 to 20  @xmath10 .",
    "it is worth noting that , thanks to our high mass resolution , we are effectively modelling each individual supernovae explosion , one star at a time .",
    "following the supernova event , cooling is delayed by a dissipation timescale @xmath55 , which we have set to 50,000  yr , given typical densities on the scales of our minimum resolution of 0.5  pc ( see rosdahl et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "to enable the rapid development of a realistic ism structure that is approximately similar to that in the inner milky way disk , e.g. , at @xmath56kpc galactocentric radius , we first run the simulation from 0 to 5 myr with an `` initial feedback model '' that includes fuv , euv and sn feedback .",
    "however , because there is an initial transient burst of star formation that occurs before feedback can begin to fully regulate the ism and because the fuv feedback from stars is quite long - lived ( i.e. , @xmath45myr ) , we artificially lower the intensity of fuv radiation from these initial phase star particles by a reduction factor of 0.1 , while keeping euv and sn feedback as normal .",
    "the net result of this model is that by 5 myr , the fuv intensity from the initial phase stars is at a median level of 5.3  @xmath57 within the 100  pc thick disk midplane region , where @xmath58 is the standard habing ( 1968 ) intensity .",
    "this value is similar to that of the milky way at galactocentric radii of @xmath56kpc ( tasker & tan 2009 ) .",
    "the main focus of our work is then to investigate how implementing different feedback methods from stars formed after 5  myr affects ism and star formation properties from the period from 5 to 20  myr .",
    "note , that the residual effects of feedback from the initial phase stars continue after 5  myr , but quite rapidly lose importance due to the short timescales associated with massive star evolution .",
    "details of the radiative transfer algorithm can be found in rosdahl et al .",
    "( 2013 ) . here",
    "we outline the main methods and approximations used in this paper . for stability reasons , the radiative transfer time - step scales inversely with the speed of light @xmath59 .",
    "to avoid very small timesteps relative to those set by the hydrodynamics , we use the `` reduced speed of light approximation '' ( gnedin & abel 2001 ) , and limit the propagation of radiation to a global speed , @xmath60 , where @xmath59 is the true speed of light . in our simulations we adopt the value of @xmath61 , i.e. , 1500  km  s@xmath62 .",
    "we expect the effects of this choice to be relatively minor ( see rosdahl et al .",
    "2015 for explorations of the effect of this choice on sfrs in larger - scale simulations ) .",
    "it is important to note that this approximation is only valid if the reduced speed of light @xmath63 results in a light crossing time that is short compared to smallest of the sound crossing time , the recombination time and the advection time .",
    "we have checked _ a posteriori _ that our simulation indeed satisfies these requirements . for the transport of radiation ,",
    "as described in detail in rosdahl & teyssier ( 2015 ) , we use a first order moment method , which tracks in each cell the radiation energy density @xmath64 ( zeroth moment , energy per unit volume ) and the bulk radiation flux vector * f * ( first moment , energy per unit area and time ) . the system of moment equations is closed with the m1 expression for",
    "the radiation pressure tensor , which has the large numerical advantage that it can be evaluated purely from the local quantities @xmath64 and * f*. a moment method treats the radiation as a fluid , rather than tracking individual rays , giving the very important advantage that we can treat a large number of radiation sources . as demonstrated in detail in rosdahl & teyssier ( 2015 ) , the sacrifice that comes with this is that rays from individual sources are treated in an average sense in every volume element , resulting in a radiation field which is not as accurate as with ray - tracing , on scales of the source separation .",
    "in rosdahl et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , we demonstrate that qualitatively we still retain a correct radiation field in a galaxy disk setup .",
    "the two moments are the radiation energy density @xmath64 ( erg @xmath65 ) and the radiation flux @xmath66 ( erg @xmath67 ) . for the latter ,",
    "we need to model the radiation pressure @xmath68 ( erg @xmath69 ) , for which we use the m1 closure .",
    "the set of moment equations is solved separately for each radiation group , which is defined for a specific frequency range . for this work , we model four radiation groups ( see table  [ tab : rt ] ) that determine the photodissociation of @xmath70 , the ionization of @xmath71 , the ionization of @xmath72 , and the ionization of @xmath73 , respectively .",

    "after a burst of ionizing feedback , which raises @xmath99 to about 0.4 , these mass and volume fractions of the different phases approach relatively constant values as the simulation evolves towards 20  myr , illustrating that by these metrics the ism reaches a quasi - statistical equilibrium .    comparing the results of the different feedback simulations in the sequence from runs 1 to 4 ( nf , lw , lw+euv , lw+euv+sn )",
    ", we see the @xmath100 mass fraction at 20  myr being reduced to close to the quasi - equilbrium value mostly by the introduction of lw feedback . on its own ,",
    "this lw feedback keeps most of the gas in the hi phase .",
    "with introduction of euv and sn , a more significant mass fraction of the ionized phase is created .",
    "sn - only feedback leads to a much higher @xmath100 mass fraction .",
    "the equivalent results to figures  [ fig : f1 ] and [ fig : f2 ] for the simulations that have different feedback implementation after 5 myr are shown in the appendix , i.e. , no feedback ( run nf ) , only dissociating lyman - werner feedback ( run lw ) , dissociating plus ionizing feedback ( run lw+euv ) and only supernova feedback ( run sn ) ( figures a1 - a8 ) .",
    "the choice of how feedback is implemented can have a profound effect on the structure of the ism .",
    "this is also illustrated in figures  [ fig : f4 ] and [ fig : f5 ] , which show the results of all the above simulations side - by - side after 20  myr of evolution .",
    "the nf run retains denser clouds and the global ism is generally cooler , with heat input only from the declining effects of feedback from the initial phase ( 0 to 5  myr formed ) stars . adding lw feedback results in much smaller @xmath0 mass and volume fractions and a generally warmer ism",

    "adding euv feedback continues these trends .",
    "long , @xmath101pc , cold , dense filamentary structures are seen aligned with the galactic plane .",
    "finally , the fiducial model with lw+euv+sn feedback leads to more disruption in the distribution of the dense gas structures : e.g. , filaments tend to be shorter and/or more irregular .",
    "there are enhanced @xmath0 fractions in some regions due to sweeping up of previously atomic gas .",
    "more strongly fluctuating gas potentials also appear to lead to a greater dispersal of the stars that are born in bound star clusters .",
    "sn - only feedback leads to much more disruption of the initial molecular clouds , higher fractions of the ism in the hot ( @xmath102k ) phase , but also larger fractions of the molecular phase .",
    "the young stars are more dispersed in the sn - only feedback run .    in figures  [ fig : f6 ] and [ fig : f7 ] , we present comparisons of the area and mass - weighted probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of gas mass surface densities , viewed from above the disk , that arise in the different models .",
    "these are amongst the simplest statistical metrics of the ism , which can be compared to observed systems , especially as we enter the era of full operation of the _ atacama large mm - submm array _ ( alma ) that has the ability to resolve @xmath6parsec scales in nearby galaxies .",

    "region 1 , a square patch of 400  pc on a side , is centered in the disk midplane at ( @xmath109  pc , @xmath110  pc ) relative to the center of the kpc box and contains the most vigorous starburst activity .",
    "region 2 , which is 400  pc by 600  pc in size and centered at ( @xmath111  pc , @xmath112  pc ) , has a more moderate level of star formation .",
    "these regions are the same as those previously analyzed at 10  myr in the mhd simulations of van loo et al .",
    "recall that each star particle represents a cluster or sub - cluster with 100  @xmath29 that has formed during the last 10  myr , with the red color for the 0 - 5  myr population ( common to all runs ) and white color for those formed from 5 to 10  myr and having varying feedback properties .",
    "these figures give a dramatic visual illustration of differences in the morphologies of molecular clouds and their star formation activity that result from different implementations of feedback physics .",
    "for example , in region 1 much more massive star clusters form in the no feedback run , while these are mostly dispersed during the sequence lw , lw+euv and lw+euv+sn .",

    ", we find that the five most massive clusters / associations ( only counting stars formed after 5  myr ) have a mean mass of @xmath116 . introducing lw feedback reduces this to @xmath117 ; lw+euv feedback further reduces this to @xmath118 ; and lw+euv+sn feedback to @xmath119 . on the other hand the sn only feedback simulation produces five most massive clusters with mean mass of @xmath120 .",

    "after 5 myr , the no feedback case then , eventually , converges towards a sfr approximately equal to the nf0 run as the effects of stars formed in the initial feedback phase die out . introducing only lyman - werner feedback leads to factors of several reduction in sfr compared to run nf over most of the 20  myr evolution .",
    "however , the sfr now also shows much larger fluctuations , which indicates the bursty nature of star formation and subsequent feedback that is occuring in the simulated disk patch .",

    "the final step to reaching the fiducial model is the introduction of supernova feedback , i.e. , run lw+euv+sn , leads to a significant further reduction in the sfrs .",
    "the global evolution of the sfr appears to show a longer period systematic fluctuation , decreasing from an initial relatively high value at 5 myr by almost a factor of 100 around 15  myr , before increasing again to a value around @xmath126 by 20  myr .",

    "the fiducial model of lw+euv+sn feedback brings the sfr down by about a factor of 10 at a slightly larger gas content .",
    "we see that the fiducial model sits in the middle of the distribution of observed sfrs of bigiel et al .",
    "the effect of the sn - only model is shown by the orange arrow from nf .",

    "thus we also analyze the properties of these regions at 10  myr , i.e. , the time at which @xmath2 is evaluated , with the sfr being the average from 5 to 10  myr .",
    "we note that this means conditions in the ism in these regions have not reached quasi - statistical equilibrium .",
    "however , on these scales of only several hundred parsecs , such equilibrium is in any case not likely to be achieved when averaging over 5  myr timescales .",
    "observationally , at these scales of several hundred parsec sided regions , a greater dispersion in the normalization of the kennicutt - schmidt relation has been reported ( leroy et al . , 2013 ) .",
    "region 2 , with average conditions quite similar to those of the kpc patch as a whole , shows qualitatively similar behavior .",
    "however , lw feedback is seen to play a relatively more important role here along the sequence to the fiducial model of lw+euv+sn .",
    "the fiducial model rests at a location slightly elevated in its normalization compared to the median of the data , although still within the range of the observed scatter in the ks relation . since region 2",
    "is centered on a gmc complex , this slight enhancement is also consistent with theoretical expectations , given the clustered nature of star formation in disk galaxies . in region 2",
    "the @xmath121-field model also leads to a significant reduction in sfr , although not as much as that due to the fiducial feedback model .",
    "the sn - only feedback model is also not as effective as the full radiative feedback plus sn model in this case .",
    "region 1 , centered on a very dense grouping of gmcs that are also interacting , shows very high sfr surface densities .",
    "the nf0 and nf models have @xmath128 , with the latter retaining a gas mass surface density of about @xmath129 at 10  myr .",
    "lw feedback brings the sfr down by about a factor of five , with addition of ionization causing only a minor reduction beyond this .",
    "the final lw+euv+sn model has its sfr reduced further by a factor of 10 to @xmath130 .",
    "however , note the largest reduction of sfr in absolute terms resulted at the stage of introduction of fuv @xmath0 dissociating feedback .",
    "the introduction of sn causes leads to a dramatic reduction in @xmath2 , i.e. , by about a factor of three , which is caused by expulsion of gas from region 1 to its immediate surroundings .",
    "this illustrates the inherent difficulties of measuring the ks relation on these small scales of several hundred parsecs .",
    "still , the final location of region 1 in the ks diagram for the fiducial model is at a normalization that is consistent with the upper envelope of the observational data , as might be expected for a starburst region .",
    "finally , we note that introduction of magnetic field support affects the sfr of region 1 only by about a factor of two , a smaller factor than in region 1 and in the kpc patch as a whole .",
    "this is because the dense gmcs in region 1 would need stronger @xmath121-field strengths to resist collapse to the same level as the lower density gmcs in the other parts of disk .",
    "sn - only feedback reduces sfrs by factors of a few and , like the case of lw+euv+sn , expels most of the gas from the region .",
    "the final location of the sn - only model in the ks diagram is at a level that is about 10 times higher than the upper envelope of the observed data .",
    "we have found that the combined effects of dissociating , ionizing , and supernova feedback have a dramatic influence on the structure and star formation activity of the interstellar medium of a disk galaxy .",
    "the relative mass and volume fractions of different phases of the ism approach quasi - static values after 20  myr of evolution of the simulated kpc patch of the disk .",
    "the detailed structure of the ism , especially dense , molecular clouds , and the spatial distribution of young stellar populations varies significantly with how feedback is implemented , as we have also seen in comparison to a supernova only feedback model .    of the forms of feedback we have investigated , fuv radiation that dissociates @xmath0 molecules and heats the gas , typically plays the largest absolute role in reducing sfrs from those seen in simulations with no feedback from the newly forming stars .",
    "these reduction factors are similar to those seen in models including magnetic support from an ism magnetized at a level of @xmath131 .",
    "however , the full combination of radiative and mechanical feedback from supernovae , as in our fiducial model , is needed to bring the overall star formation rates down to values similar to those observed in real disk systems . averaged on kpc scales , the sfrs resulting from the sn - only feedback models are very similar to those achieved in our fiducial simulation , even though these involve large differences in the chemical and temperature structures of the gas and in the spatial distribution of young stars",
    "also , in smaller scale regions centered on gmc complexes , there are significant differences in the sfrs between the sn - only case and the full feedback model .",
    "these results illustrate the importance of considering fuv feedback in understanding the star formation activity of galactic disk systems .",
    "the simulations presented in this paper of course have their limitations and there is scope for improvement , which may influence the final results .",
    "for example , it will be necessary to combine these feedback models with magnetized ism simulations .",
    "additional feedback effects such as protostellar outflows from forming stars , stellar winds and radiation pressure will also need to be considered .",
    "the momentum input from these sources can be comparable to that from supernovae , although in the case of outflows and winds much of this momentum may be lost in oppositely directed flows from a distributed population of stars . also ,",
    "initial test simulations including radiation pressure by rosdahl et al .",
    ", in prep .",
    ", indicate that it plays a relatively minor role on the scale of this kpc patch . on smaller scales",
    "radiation pressure has been studied by , e.g. , krumholz & matzner ( 2009 ) who find it can be important feedback in modifying hii region dynamics around massive star clusters .",
    "the contribution of relativistic cosmic rays , which are known to have a similar energy density to magnetic and thermal pressures in the local galactic ism , will also need to be included . to constrain these more complex models and their particular parameter choices against observed systems",
    ", we will also need to examine more detailed statistical metrics , e.g. , of structural , kinematic and chemical properties of the ism , in addition to sfr activity .",
    "improved resolution down to the core scale of individual star formation is also highly desirable , especially for resolution of the early stages of ionizing feedback , which will then also necessitate a fully stochastic treatment of the initial stellar mass function of massive stars . on the other hand ,",
    "the region we have simulated is relatively limited in spatial extent , which may lead to stochastic effects related to the particular gmcs that are included in the volume .",
    "future work should also aim to expand the number of different realizations simulated , the size of the simulated volume and also explore the effects of a range of galactic environments .",
