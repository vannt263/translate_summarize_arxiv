    "in this paper we study the dynamic electronic polarizability of a single nano - scale spherical metallic grain .",
    "this research is important because on one hand confinement effects can drastically modify the dynamic polarizability of metallic grains and on the other hand the fundamental question related to the description of crossover between microscopic and macroscopic behavior of the grains exists .",
    "the electronic polarizability was first quantum mechanically studied in ref .",

    "the electronic polarizability was also studied in applications for optical properties of small metallic grains  @xcite .",
    "more recently the nonperturbative supersymmetry technique was used to consider the effects of disorder on properties of electronic polarizability  @xcite .    here",
    "we study the dynamic electronic polarizability of a single metallic grain using quantum mechanical approach .",
    "we introduce the model for interacting electrons bound in the grain allowing us numerically to calculate the frequency dependence of the polarizability of grains of different sizes .",

    "the blue - shift of the main resonance peak in comparison with the classical mie resonance ( the red dash line in figs .  [ fig50 ] and [ fig25 ] ) can be understood as follows : in a quantum mechanical problem due to fermi - dirac statistics electron transitions may occur only from an occupied state to an empty state . for higher external frequency",
    "the total number of unrestricted electron transitions becomes higher .",
    "therefore in a quantum mechanical problem if the external frequency equals to the classical plasmon frequency , @xmath16 in figs .",
    "[ fig50 ] and [ fig25 ] , the resonance amplitude is suppressed because of a lack of possible electron transitions .",

    "these resonances can be divided into two groups : i ) low frequency single particle excitations and ii ) high frequency resonances corresponding to the transitions between the states with higher orbital quantum numbers .",
    "both of these types of excitations become less pronounced with increasing grain size .",
    "we notice that at low energies the transitions may occur only in the immediate vicinity to the fermi surface . therefore the low frequency peaks in figs .",
    "[ fig50 ] and [ fig25 ] correspond to the resonant transitions between the states which are located just below and just above the fermi surface .",
    "we now comment on the influence of disorder in the grain on the resonance peaks .",
    "first , we notice , that our consideration is based on the fact , that the disorder is weak .",
    "thus , the conducting electrons are delocalized in our model .",
    "the characteristic energy scale for disorder is the inverse scattering time @xmath26 . in the limit of weak disorder",
    "the electron propagation within the grain is almost ballistic and therefore @xmath26 is of the order of thouless energy , @xmath27 .",
    "however , both of these energy scales are smaller than the plasma frequency , @xmath17 , which is the characteristic scale for the resonances . therefore , we expect that for energies less than @xmath17 the disorder is irrelevant and can not modify the picture qualitatively",
    ".    however , the presence of disorder may lead to the broadening and suppression of all of the resonance peaks .",
    "the broadening effects are beyond our present consideration .",
    "the disorder caused suppression might make the secondary resonances hard to detect , as they are small compared to the main resonance peak .",
    "we also mention that our consideration can be generalized for the description of slightly non - spherical grains . in this case",
    "the non ideal grain shape can be studied within the perturbation theory .",
    "it will result in the changes of the energy levels structure . in particular ,",
    "the degenerate energy levels will be split .",
    "that will slightly affect the positions of the resonance peaks .    to conclude the analysis of the polarizabilities we compare our findings for @xmath0 with the known result for classical polarizability @xmath21 ,  @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath9 is the radius of a grain and @xmath29 is the grain dielectric constant ; within the drude model @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the plasma resonance frequency and @xmath32 is the damping factor . the imaginary part of the polarizability @xmath21 in eq .",

    "our consideration is valid for metallic grains meaning that the grain itself is a good conductor .",
    "this means that the grain size @xmath9 is much larger than the fermi wavelength @xmath40 .",
    "in addition , the disorder within the grain is weak such that electrons within the grain are delocalized . if these conditions are valid there is a small parameter in the problem - the invers grain conductance @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the grain conductance .",
