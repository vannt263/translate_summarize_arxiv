    "the classical theory of black holes predicts that anything , including light , could nt escape from the black holes .",
    "however , stephen hawking demonstrated that quantum effects could allow black holes to radiate a thermal flux of quantum particles@xcite . the assumption that the ultra - high energy modes are in their ground state",
    "was used to derive the hawking radiation in the framework of quantum field theory in curved spacetime . after this discovery",
    ", it was realized that there was the trans - planckian problem with the calculation@xcite . due to the exponential high gravitational red shift near the horizon ,",
    "the outgoing particles of the hawking radiation originate from the extremely high ( e.g. , trans - planckian ) frequency modes .",
    "so the hawking radiation relies on the validity of quantum field theory in curved spacetime to arbitrary high energies . on the other hand , quantum field theory",
    "is considered more like an effective field theory of an underlying theory whose nature remains unknown@xcite .",
    "this observation poses the question of whether any unknown physics at the planck scale could strongly influence the hawking radiation .",
    "it is believed that the trans - planckian physics manifests itself in certain modifications of the existing models .",
    "thus , even though a complete theory of quantum gravity is not yet available , we can use a bottom - to - top approach  to probe the possible effects of quantum gravity on our current theories and experiments@xcite .",
    "one possible way of how such an approach works is via modifications of energy - momentum dispersion relation @xmath2 which has been reviewed in the framework of lorentz violating theories in @xcite .    to study the trans - planckian problem , the dispersive field theory models@xcite",
    "have been proposed , which focused on studying the effect on the hawking radiation due to modifications of the dispersion relations of matter fields at high energies .",
    "these models were motivated by a hydrodynamic analogue of a black hole radiation@xcite .",
    "similar to the original method for deriving the hawking radiation , the energy fluxes for outgoing radiation were usually obtained by calculating the bogoliubov transformations between the initial and final states of incoming and outgoing radiation . in most works ,",
    "the hawking effect could be recovered at leading order for some ranges of the black hole s temperature and the particle s frequency  under some suitable assumptions although the mechanisms for recovering it were different than in the non - dispersive case .",
    "these assumptions and ranges in the models have been briefly reviewed in @xcite .",
    "while most works used the free - fall preferred frame to modify the dispersion relation , accelerated frames has been studied in @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the fluxes emitted by a black hole were not significantly affected by the choice of preferred frame as long as the acceleration of the frame was not too drastic .",
    "however , it has been numerically shown that the created particle flux dropped significantly if the acceleration became large .",
    "thus , it was conjectured that there might be no hawking radiation for a static frame .",
    "there are various methods for deriving the hawking radiation and calculating its temperature . among them",
    "is a semiclassical method of modeling hawking radiation as a tunneling process .",
    "this method was first proposed by kraus and wilczek@xcite , which is known as the null geodesic method .",
    "they employed the dynamical geometry approach to calculate the imaginary part of the action for the tunneling process of s - wave emission across the horizon and related it to the boltzmann factor for the emission at the hawking temperature .",
    "later , the tunneling behaviors of particles were investigated using the hamilton - jacobi method@xcite . in the hamilton - jacobi method",
    ", one ignores the self - gravitation of emitted particles and assumes that its action satisfies the relativistic hamilton - jacobi equation .",
    "the tunneling probability for the classically forbidden trajectory from inside to outside the horizon is obtained by using the hamilton - jacobi equation to calculate the imaginary part of the action for the tunneling process . using the null geodesic method and hamilton - jacobi method ,",
    "much fruit has been achieved@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the effects of quantum gravity on the hawking radiation have been discussed in the hamilton - jacobi method .",
    "in fact , the minimal length deformed hamilton - jacobi equation for fermions in curved spacetime have been introduced and the modified hawking temperatures have been derived@xcite . these motivate us to use the hamilton - jacobi method to study the dispersive field theory models .",
    "note that a tunneling model has been introduced in dispersive models of analogue gravity in @xcite .",
    "the hamilton - jacobi equations were imported to curved spacetime using the static preferred frame in @xcite , which leads us first to considering the static preferred frame for the dispersive field theory models .",
