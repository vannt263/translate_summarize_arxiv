    "the wide variety of systems discussed in this special issue form strong empirical evidence that electronic liquid crystals generically emerge out of correlated electronic systems in a quantum regime . on the one hand ,",
    "the uncertainty principle challenges against a single sweep numerical solution of a fermionic hamiltonian , when neither the single particle kinetic energy nor the inter - particle interaction energy can be ignored . on the other hand , the conflict between kinetic energy and interaction energy indeed appear to find a compromise in electronic liquid crystals@xcite , as first proposed in ref .",
    "this observation invites what we call `` middle - up / down approach '' to quantum phenomena of correlated systems : seeking insights in experimental data from the perspective of symmetries ( middle@xmath0down ) and then feeding those insights into theory ( middle@xmath0up ) .",
    "what guides this approach are symmetry principles .    from symmetry principles , electronic nematic and smectic phases",
    "are analogues of liquid crystalline nematic and smectic phases .",
    "when a collection of anisotropic molecules called `` nematogens '' are in a liquid phase , the system is invariant under infinitesimal translations and rotations . in a nematic phase , the system still has this translational symmetry but the rotational symmetry is broken and the system is only symmetric under a rotations by @xmath1 . in a smectic phase , the translational symmetry is also reduced in one of spatial directions and a modulated density forms in that direction .",
    "this modulation automatically breaks rotational symmetry in space as well .",
    "electronic nematic and smectic phases share similar symmetries",
    ". the smectic phase would be a kind of unidirectional charge density wave while a nematic phase could be viewed in two ways , as the melting of the unidirectional waves or as a shape instability of the fermi surface ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : strong - weak ] ) .",
    "however , the order parameters of these phases is different from their classical counter parts because the highest symmetry they may have is not that of an isotropic space but that of , for example , a square lattice@xcite .",
    "however , electronic liquid crystals as electronic phases in the quantum regime face new challenges and possibilities .",
    "one new challenge is in figuring out a mechanism for nematic formation without a pre - formed `` nematogen '' . in liquid crystal nematics the prolonged shape of the `` nematogen '' molecule provides an entropy driven mechanism : at low temperatures it is easier for them to move around if they all point in the same direction . for electronic nematics ,",
    "a mechanism for spatial symmetry breaking is more subtle though an extended range interaction is one possibility .",
    "one new phenomena arising in the electronic version of liquid crystals are the quantum phase transitions that exist between them .",
    "while phase transitions between different liquid crystalline phases are determined as a balance between energy and entropy at finite temperature , transitions between different electronic liquid crystal phases can be controlled even at zero temperature by quantum fluctuations and can lead to novel non - fermi liquid physics .    in this article , we review our recent progress in understanding electronic liquid crystal physics using a `` middle - up / down approach '' to underdoped cuprates .",

    "the rest of the article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : nematic ] , we will discuss an intra - unit - cell ( iuc ) nematic order parameter and a smectic order parameter as defined and measured in ref  @xcite .",

    "we close the article in section [ sec : closing ] with a discussion of recent theoretical developments on the subject and interesting future directions .",
    "in general , the challenge in establishing a broken symmetry is in devising an order parameter that can be pursued by experimental probes .",

    "a coarse grained field @xmath42 for a fourier peak centered at @xmath43 can be obtained by `` cutting out '' the peak and shifting the center of the peak to the origin in fourier space .",

    "it has been argued based on symmetry grounds and analogies with liquid crystals that one mechanism of the formation of an electronic nematic phase is through disordering the smectic modulations@xcite .",
    "this mechanism was the starting point for a phenomenological model of fluctuating stripe phenomena in ybco  @xcite . however , there is no unambiguous realization of this mechanism yet .",

    "now we turn to the coupling .",
    "since the modulation fields @xmath71 and @xmath72 are complex , the nematic fluctuation scalar field can couple either to the amplitude or phase of the modulation fields . the lowest order amplitude coupling terms are @xmath73 with coupling constants @xmath74 for @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",

    "second , as the phase coupling is a gradient coupling , one would expect the amplitude coupling to dominate in the homogeneous limit , in which case the strong fluctuation in the smectic modulations would likely disorder the nematic phase .",

    "@xcite showed that a tractable theory of quantum melting of stripes is possible when such melting is through proliferation of double dislocations , which could be preferred over single dislocations in the presence of an antiferromagnetic background .",
    "given the lessons on nematic formation from ref .",
    "@xcite , progress in capturing antiferromagnetism , stripe and nematic might be possible starting from the emery model .",
    "now we turn to the second key open question : relations between elc and spectral gap or superconductivity . while insulating fully filled stripe solution from hartree - fock studies  @xcite only show how stripe formation would inhibit superconductivity , dmrg calculations on the t - j model show that @xmath113wave pairing correlations make the stripes half - filled and more consistent with experiments ( see the article by scalapino and white in this issue ) .",
    "these dmrg observations make a concrete case that superconductivity and stripe formation might not be simply mutually exclusive .",
    "when it comes to the relationship between nematic order and superconductivity , much less is known . ref .",
    "@xcite showed that nematic quantum phase transition can be a continuous transition inside the superconducting dome , through a shift of nodal positions .",
    "this is only a proof that nematic and superconductivity can coexist , but not a proof that nematic order would help or hurt superconductivity .",
    "though many experiments show nematic phenomena in the psuedogap phase , as of now there is no theoretical evidence of a nematic phase causing a spectral gap .",
    "however , this could have been due to shortage of studies of strongly correlated microscopic models with nematic ordered ground states .",
    "it is quite possible the underlying antiferromagnetic fluctuations , absent in many approaches , are needed to pin down why nematic phenomena is seen in the pseudogap phase .",
    "here we describe how to use the topograph to correct for the picometer scale drift of the tip location ( typically due to both piezoelectric mechanical creep and small temperature variations during data acquisition ) . a typical topograph , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : topo ] . , shows variations at differing length scales associated with different physics : modulations with wave vectors @xmath115 and @xmath116 for the bi ( and cu ) lattice sites , a super - lattice modulation with wave vector @xmath117 , and the mentioned slowly varying apparent `` displacement '' due to long - term and picometer scale piezoelectric drift .",
    "the latter is an artifact of the experimental process and not part of the physical measurement and is best removed when possible .",
    "we define the slowly varying `` displacement '' field @xmath118 such that un - displaced positions @xmath119 ( which are the lagrangian coordinates of elasticity theory ) will form a perfect square lattice with cu lattice locations @xmath120 .",
    "now the topograph is expected to take the form @xmath121 where @xmath122 represents other contributions such as impurities etc . that @xmath118 is slowly varying compared to the scale of the super - lattice modulation and the lattice modulations is evident from the fourier transform of the topograph . in order to extract the slow varying @xmath118 , it is useful to introduce a coarsening length scale @xmath123",
    "over which @xmath118 is roughly constant such that @xmath124 .",
    "the fourier transform of the topograph shows that we can quite safely choose a small @xmath125 since the lattice peak is sharp .",
    "now consider @xmath126 the weighted average of @xmath127 over the length scale @xmath123 . since @xmath128 , their contributions average out , leaving @xmath129 here , we made use of the fact that @xmath130 for small @xmath131 .",
    "we can define the y - component @xmath132 in a similar fashion .",
    "hence we can extract the full displacement field @xmath118 ( much as in the spirit of elasticity theory ) and thus undo all effects of both piezoelectric drift and also set the origin of the coordinate system such that @xmath120 .",
    "it turns out that the drift over the extent of a typical image is approximately one or two lattice - spacings out of @xmath133 or less than 10 picometer per unit cell .",
    "this manifests itself through the phases @xmath134 and @xmath135 which jump by 2 in some regions .",
    "these phase jumps need to be removed to make @xmath136 a single valued quantity . by taking a derivative of the image to locate the jumps and adding @xmath137 to @xmath118 where appropriate can perform this function .",
    "finally , and importantly , the same geometrical transformations that define @xmath138 and @xmath139 are carried out on each @xmath34 acquired simultaneously with the @xmath140 so that both are registered to each other while being rendered periodic with the lattice ; without these procedures , the @xmath31 function of the main text can not be evaluated correctly .",
