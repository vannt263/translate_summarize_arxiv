    "physical - layer security schemes exploit channel characteristics , such as noise and fading , to allow a group of nodes to share information in such a way that other unintended receivers ( called eavesdroppers or wiretappers ) can not recover that secret information .",
    "physical - layer security has often been studied in the context of the _ wiretap channel _ , which was first introduced by wyner  @xcite and later refined by csiszr and krner  @xcite . in the wiretap channel",
    ", a source tries to send secret information to a destination at the presence of a wiretapper .",
    "when the source - to - wiretapper channel is a degraded version of the source - to - destination channel , wyner  @xcite showed that the source can transmit a message at a positive ( secrecy ) rate to the destination by taking advantage of the less `` noisy '' channel to the destination .",
    "the degradedness condition was removed in  @xcite , which showed that a positive secrecy rate is possible for the case where the source - to - destination channel is `` more capable '' than the source - to - wiretapper channel .",
    "generalization of wyner s work to the gaussian wiretap channel was considered in  @xcite .    in wyner s",
    "original paper , a code design based on group codes was described for the wiretap channel . in  @xcite ,",
    "a code design based on coset codes was suggested for the type - ii ( the destination channel is error free ) binary erasure wiretap channel .",
    "recently , the authors of  @xcite constructed low density parity check ( ldpc ) based wiretap codes for binary erasure channel ( bec ) and binary symmetric channel ( bsc ) .",
    "reference  @xcite considered the design of secure nested codes for type - ii wiretap channels .",
    "more recently , references  @xcite and @xcite concurrently established the result that polar codes  @xcite can achieve the secrecy capacity of the degraded binary - input symmetric - output ( biso ) wiretap channels .",
    "note that all these designs are for codes with asymptotically large block lengths .    in some scenarios ,",
    "it is sufficient for two nodes to agree upon a common secret ( a key ) , instead of having to send secret information from a source to a destination . under this relaxed criterion",
    ", it is shown in  @xcite that , with the use of a feedback channel , a positive key rate is achievable when the destination and wiretapper channels are two conditionally independent ( given the source input symbols ) memoryless binary channels , even if the destination channel is not more capable than the wiretapper s channel .",
    "this notion of secret sharing is formalized in  @xcite based on the concept of _ common randomness _ between the source and destination .",
    "a three - phase process of achieving secret sharing over a wiretap channel with an additional public channel between the source and destination is suggested in  @xcite .",
    "the three phases are respectively advantage distillation , information reconciliation , and privacy amplification . advantage distillation aims to provide the destination an advantage over the wiretapper .",
    "information reconciliation aims at generating an identical random sequence at both the source and destination .",
    "privacy amplification is the step that extracts a secret key from the identical random sequence agreed upon by the source and destination .",
    "information reconciliation is probably the most studied and most essential part of any secret sharing scheme .",
    "perhaps the most well known practical application of reconciliation protocols is quantum cryptography , where nonorthogonal states of a quantum system provide two terminals with observations of correlated randomness which are at least partially secret from a potential eavesdropper .",
    "many works  @xcite@xcite have been devoted to the study of reconciliation for both discrete and continuous random variables in quantum key distribution schemes . for the case of discrete random variables",
    ", cascade is an iterative reconciliation protocol first proposed by brassard and salvail in  @xcite .",
    "recently , bsc - optimized ldpc codes have been employed in  @xcite to reduce the interactivity and improve the efficiency of cascade . on the other hand ,",
    "the work on slice error correction  @xcite , which converts continuous variables into binary strings and makes use of interactive error correcting codes , is the first reconciliation protocol for continuous random variables .",
    "modern coding techniques like turbo codes  @xcite and ldpc codes  @xcite have also been directly applied within information reconciliation protocols for continuous random variables .",
    "another application of reconciliation protocols is secret key agreement over wireless channels .",
    "an ldpc code - based method of extracting secrecy from jointly gaussian random sources generated by a rayleigh fading model has been studied in  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", multilevel coding / multistage decoding - like reconciliation with ldpc codes has been proposed for the quasi - static rayleigh fading wiretap channel . in  @xcite ,",
    "punctured ldpc codes were employed in a coding scheme for the gaussian wiretap channel to reduce the security gap , which expresses the quality difference between the destination channel and wiretapper channel required to achieve a sufficient level of security .",
    "the main idea of this scheme is to hide the information bits from the wiretapper by means of puncturing . in  @xcite ,",
    "further reductions in the security gap are achieved using a reconciliation scheme based on non - systematic ldpc codes along with scrambling of the information bits prior to encoding .    in this paper , we consider the problem of secret sharing over the gaussian wiretap channel with the constraints of binary phase - shift keyed ( bpsk ) source symbols and symbol - by - symbol hard - decision quantization at the destination .",
    "our main goal is to develop a coding structure based on which practical `` close - to - capacity '' secret sharing ( key agreement ) codes can be constructed .",
    "finite block length and moderate encoder / decoder complexity are the two main practical constraints that we consider when designing these codes .",
    "the secrecy performance of our designs will be measured by the rate of secret information shared between the source and destination ( which will be referred to as the _ key rate _ ) as well as the rate of information that is leaked to the wiretapper through all its observations of the wiretap and public channels ( which will be referred to as the _ leakage rate _ ) .    to rigorously gauge the secrecy performance of our code designs ,",
    "we introduce the notion of relaxed key capacity in section  [ sec : relax_keycap ] .",
    "the relaxed key capacity is the maximum key rate that can be achieved over the wiretap channel provided that the leakage rate is bounded below a fixed value . in section  [ sec : ch_mod ] , we calculate the relaxed key capacities over the bpsk source - constrained gaussian wiretap channel with and without the constraint of hard - decision quantization at the destination . in section  [ sec : ssldpc ] , we present a secret sharing scheme employing an ensemble of regular ldpc codes for the bpsk - constrained gaussian wiretap channel with hard - decision quantization at the destination .",
    "we prove that the proposed scheme achieves the relaxed key capacity with asymptotically large block length .",
    "we note that a similar ldpc - based key agreement scheme employing observations of correlated discrete stationary sources at the source , destination , and wiretapper was studied in  @xcite . a more detailed comparison between our scheme and the one proposed in  @xcite is also provided in section  [ sec : ssldpc ] .",
    "the asymptotic result in section  [ sec : ssldpc ] provides us a reasonable theoretical justification to design practical secret sharing schemes based on the proposed coding structure .",
    "we propose in section  [ sec : wz ] to replace the regular ldpc code ensemble in section  [ sec : ssldpc ] by fixed ldpc codes that are more amenable to practical implementation . in the same section",
    ", we describe a code search algorithm based on density evolution analysis to obtain good irregular ldpc codes for the proposed secret sharing scheme .",
    "we also compare the secrecy performance achieved by these irregular ldpc codes , bsc - optimized irregular ldpc codes , and some standard regular ldpc codes against the relaxed key capacity calculated in section  [ sec : ch_mod ] .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : con ] .",
    "we start by reviewing the framework of secret sharing proposed in @xcite .",
    "the objective of secret sharing is for the source and destination to share secret information , which is obscure to the wiretapper , by exploiting _",
    "common randomness _",
    "@xcite available to them through the wiretap channel . here",
    ", we consider the wiretap channel to be memoryless and specified by the conditional probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath0 .",
    "when the symbol @xmath1 is sent by the source , @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the corresponding symbols observed by the destination and wiretapper , respectively .",
    "in addition , we restrict ourselves to cases in which @xmath2 and @xmath3 are conditionally independent given @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath4 .",
    "this restriction is satisfied by the gaussian wiretap channel considered in section  [ sec : ch_mod ] and some other wireless wiretap channels @xcite . for convenience",
    ", we will refer to the wiretap channel by the triple @xmath5 .",
    "in addition to the wiretap channel , there is an interactive , authenticated , public channel with unlimited capacity between the source and destination .",
    "the source and destination can communicate via the public channel without any power or rate restriction .",
    "the wiretapper can perfectly observe all communications over the public channel but can not tamper with the transmitted messages .",
    "the aforementioned common randomness is to be extracted by a proper combination of transmission from the source to the destination through the wiretap channel @xmath5 and information exchanges between them over the public channel . to this end",
    ", we consider the class of permissible secret sharing strategies suggested in  @xcite .",
    "consider @xmath6 time instants labeled by @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the wiretap channel is used @xmath8 times during these @xmath6 time instants at @xmath9 . set @xmath10 .",
    "the public channel is used during the other ( @xmath11 ) time instants . before the secret sharing process starts ,",
    "the source and destination generate , respectively , independent random variables @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "then a permissible strategy proceeds as follows : stands for the sequence of symbols @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is null . ]    * at time instant @xmath16 , the source sends message @xmath17 to the destination , and the destination sends message @xmath18 to the source .",
    "both transmissions are carried over the public channel . * at time instant @xmath19 for @xmath20 , the source sends the symbol @xmath21 to the wiretap channel .",
    "the destination and wiretapper observe the corresponding symbols @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "there is no message exchange via the public channel , i.e. , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are both null . * at time instant @xmath26 for @xmath20 , the source sends message @xmath17 to the destination , and the destination sends message @xmath27 to the source . both transmissions are carried over the public channel .    at the end of the @xmath6 time",
    "instants , the source generates its secret key @xmath28 , and the destination generates its secret key @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 take values from the same finite set @xmath32 .    slightly extending the achievable key rate definition in @xcite , for @xmath33 ,",
    "we call @xmath34 an _ achievable key - leakage rate pair _ through the wiretap channel @xmath5 if for every @xmath35 , there exists a permissible secret sharing strategy of the form described above such that    1 .",
    "@xmath36 , 2 .",
    "@xmath37 , 3 .",
    "@xmath38 , 4 .",
    "@xmath39 , and 5 .",
    "@xmath40 ,    for sufficiently large @xmath8 .",
    "condition 2 restricts that the public messages ( the messages conveyed through the public channel ) contain a negligible rate of information about the key , while condition 3 limits to @xmath41 the rate of key information that the wiretapper can extract from its own channel observations and the public messages . note that condition 3 is trivially satisfied if @xmath42 of the achievable key rate definition in  @xcite when @xmath43 , if the combined condition @xmath44 is employed instead of conditions  2 and 3 , then it is easy to see that if @xmath34 is an achievable key - leakage rate pair , @xmath45 is also achievable , for any @xmath46 , by simply transmitting the additional key information ( of rate @xmath47 ) through the public channel .",
    "separating the two conditions as suggested avoids such artificial consequence of the combined condition . ] . for the cases in which the alphabet of @xmath1 is not finite , we also impose the following power constraint to the symbol sequence @xmath48 sent out by the source : @xmath49 with probability one ( w.p.1 ) for sufficiently large @xmath8 .",
    "we note that the idea of key - leakage rate pair is similar to that of the secrecy - equivocation rate pair originally defined in  @xcite .",
    "@xmath41-relaxed key capacity _ is defined as the maximum value of @xmath50 such that @xmath34 is an achievable key - leakage rate pair .",
    "the main reason for us to introduce the notion of relaxed key capacity is to employ it as a gauge to measure the performance of practical codes that will be presented in .",
    "since these codes have finite block lengths and are to be decoded by the belief propagation ( bp ) algorithm , they do not achieve zero leakage rate . thus using the relaxed key capacity provides a more suitable comparison than using the original `` straight '' key capacity in  @xcite .",
    "also , since these practical codes do not give zero leakage rate , their use could be considered as an information - reconciliation step .",
    "the secrecy performance could be further improved by additional privacy amplification .    for wiretap channels that satisfy the aforementioned conditional independence requirement , we have the following result , whose proof is sketched in appendix  [ app : pf_keycapgen ] :    [ thm : keycapgen ] the @xmath41-relaxed key capacity of the memoryless wiretap channel @xmath5 with conditional pdf @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 \\leq p } \\left [    \\min \\{i(x;y ) - i(y;z ) + r_l , i(x;y)\\ } \\right].\\ ] ]    we employ this result to calculate the relaxed key capacities of the bpsk - constrained gaussian wiretap channel in the next section .",
    "the achievability proof of theorem  [ thm : keycapgen ] ( cf .",
    "appendix  [ app : pf_keycapgen ] ) employs random wyner - ziv coding , in which the received symbols at the destination need to be quantized due to the fact that the channel alphabet at the destination in the gaussian wiretap channel is continuously distributed . in this paper",

    "to visualize the loss in key capacity , shows @xmath72 and @xmath77 versus the maximum allowable snr ( @xmath82 ) for different values of @xmath41 .",
    "we can see that the loss in key capacity due to the hard - decision quantization is no more than @xmath83 bits per ( wiretap ) channel use for the cases shown .",
    "the achievability proof of theorem  [ thm : keycapgen ] in appendix  [ app : pf_keycapgen ] employs a secret sharing scheme with random wyner - ziv coding . for the bpsk - constrained gaussian wiretap channel with destination hard - decision quantization , we show in this section that a secret sharing scheme that employs a properly constructed ensemble of regular ldpc codes can also asymptotically achieve the @xmath41-relaxed key capacity",
    ". we will design practical secret sharing schemes for the bpsk - constrained gaussian wiretap channel in section  [ sec : wz ] based on the ldpc coding structure proposed here .",
    "to start describing the proposed secret sharing scheme , let us consider an @xmath84 binary linear block code @xmath85 with @xmath86 distinct codewords of length @xmath8 and an @xmath87-dimensional subspace @xmath88 in @xmath85 .",
    "the pair @xmath89 defines what we call an @xmath90 _ secret sharing binary linear block code_. given any such @xmath89 pair , let @xmath32 be the quotient of @xmath85 by @xmath88 . then @xmath32 is a linear space of @xmath91 distinct cosets of the form @xmath92 , where @xmath93 .",
    "we will use the coset index in @xmath32 as the secret key .",

    "the ratios @xmath94 and @xmath95 will be referred to as the _ code rate _ and _ key rate _ of the @xmath90 secret sharing binary linear block code , respectively .",

    ", @xmath32 will be of dimension @xmath102 ; so the actual key rate will be larger than @xmath103 .",

    "hence , we have opted for the combined union and shulman - feder bounding technique in  @xcite , which does however require the biso nature of the channel from the ( quantized ) destination to the wiretapper .",
    "obviously , lemma  [ lm : existldpc ] also implies the existence of a fixed @xmath89 from the secret sharing regular ldpc ensemble with vanishing decoding errors in our design , and hence the use of this fixed @xmath89 is also sufficient to achieve the relaxed key capacity in our case",
    ".    expressed in our notation , elements in the ldpc code ensemble of @xcite are also of the form @xmath89 .",
    "for our ensemble , @xmath88 is ( conditionally ) uniformly distributed over the set of all subspaces of a given @xmath85 . for the ensemble of @xcite ,",
    "@xmath88 is ( conditionally ) uniformly distributed over the set of subspaces of @xmath85 specified by the concatenation of the parity matrices of @xmath85 and another properly chosen regular ldpc code .",
    "while each element in the ensemble of @xcite is also an element of our ensemble , the two ensembles are different since the respective ( conditional ) uniform distributions for @xmath88 are defined over two different sets of subspaces . in a sense , the ensemble of @xcite is more restrictive since @xmath88 also needs to be an ldpc code .",
    "the discussion in this section shows that the ldpc structure needs to be imposed only on @xmath85 but not on @xmath88 .",
    "this bears significance in the design of practical codes because the design based on one ldpc structure derived from our ensemble is much simpler , as will be illustrated in the following section .",
