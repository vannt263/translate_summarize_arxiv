    "the central star of the helix nebula ( ngc7293 ) is a hot white dwarf , wd2226@xmath2210 , with an effective temperature of @xmath0100,000 k @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations of the helix nebula using _ rosat _ and _ chandra _ show a point source at the position of the central star @xcite .",
    "this x - ray source not only shows a soft spectral component from the photosphere , but also a harder spectral component whose origin is uncertain .",
    "a hot white dwarf by itself is not expected to emit hard x - rays ; the hard x - ray spectral component must originate externally .",
    "it has been suggested that this hard x - ray emission is caused by the interaction between a fast stellar wind and the ambient nebular material @xcite , although the central star of the helix nebula is not known to have a fast stellar wind @xcite and the x - ray emission is not diffuse as seen in the cat s eye nebula @xcite .",
    "the helix nebula central star is not known to have a binary companion @xcite and has been used as a standard star @xcite . what is the origin of the hard x - ray emission from the central star of the helix nebula ?    an excellent opportunity to search for clues to the origin of this hard x - ray emission is provided by the helix nebula central star itself . as a 100,000 k hot white dwarf , it is a powerful source of h - ionizing uv radiation .",
    "any gaseous objects in its close vicinity will be ionized and produce h@xmath1 line emission .",
    "high - dispersion ( r @xmath3 30,000 ) , long - slit observations of this h@xmath1 emission can be used to determine its spatial extent , velocity profile , and temporal variations , which supply pertinent information about the immediate surroundings of the star .",
    "spatially extended h@xmath1 emission indicates a nebular origin .",
    "spatially unresolved h@xmath1 emission could originate from the atmosphere of the white dwarf itself or the ionized atmosphere of a companion star or a jovian planet .",
    "these possibilities could be distinguished from the orbital velocity and period measurements of the h@xmath1 line @xcite .",
    "high - dispersion spectroscopy of hot white dwarfs has been used to demonstrate the existence of dme companion stars @xcite .    to probe the environment of the central star of the helix nebula",
    ", we have obtained multi - epoch , long - slit , high - dispersion spectra at the h@xmath1 and [ ]  @xmath46548,6583 lines .",
    "temporal variations of the spectra are detected ! in this paper",
    "we report the observations and discuss the significance of our results .",
    "we obtained high - dispersion spectroscopic observations of the central star of the helix nebula with the echelle spectrograph on the 4 m telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory on 2000 december 4 , 8 , and 11 .",
    "these observations were made during two unrelated programs , and thus used two different instrumental configurations ( chosen for those programs ) .    in each observation a 79 line mm@xmath5 echelle grating was used .",
    "the observations on 2000 december 4 were made in a multi - order mode , using a 226 line mm@xmath5 cross - disperser and a broad - band blocking filter ( gg385 ) , while the observations on 2000 december 8 and 11 were made in a single - order mode , using a flat mirror and a broad h@xmath1 filter ( central wavelength 6563 with 75   fwhm ) to isolate the order containing h@xmath1 .",
    "for each observation the long - focus red camera was used to obtain a reciprocal dispersion of 3.5   mm@xmath5 at h@xmath1 .",
    "the spectra were imaged using the site2k # 6 ccd detector .",
    "the 24 @xmath6 m pixel size corresponds to 026 pixel@xmath5 along the slit and @xmath00.08   pixel@xmath5 along the dispersion axis . the observations on december 4 used a 10 slit , while the observations on december 8 and 11 used a 16 slit . the resultant instrumental resolution ,",
    "as measured by the fwhm of the unresolved telluric emission lines , was 0.24   and 0.29 (11  and 13  at h@xmath1 ) for these two slit widths , respectively .",
    "the observations of the helix nebula central star are summarized in table  [ obs_sum ] .",
    "two exposures were obtained at each epoch to aid in cosmic - ray removal .",
    "the observations were reduced using standard packages in @xmath7 . all spectra were bias and dark corrected , and cosmic - ray events were removed by hand .",
    "observations of a quartz lamp were used to correct for pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations in the ccd .",
    "observations of a th  ar lamp were used to determine the dispersion correction and then telluric lines in the source observations were used to check for the absolute wavelength calibration .",
    "the spectrum of the central star is contaminated by nebular and sky emission . in order to investigate the detailed spectral properties of the central star this contamination",
    "must be subtracted .",
    "this can be accomplished because the nebular and sky emission components are both spatially extended while the stellar emission is unresolved . in figure  [ neb_subtract ]",
    "we show the raw spectra extracted from the echellograms acquired on 2000 december 11 .",
    "the observations at this epoch are the most heavily contaminated by a solar component due to the nearly full lunar phase .",
    "figures  [ neb_subtract]a&b present the raw spectra obtained off and on the star , respectively .",
    "these spectra show a number of telluric oh lines , solar absorption features ( most prominently between 6565   and 6575  ) , and the h@xmath1 and [ ] @xmath46548,6583 nebular emission lines from the planetary nebula .",
    "the difference between these two spectra , the `` background - subtracted '' stellar spectrum , is shown in figure  [ neb_subtract]c .",
    "the two different instrument configurations , multi- and single - order , result in different spectral responses .",
    "these spectral responses must be accurately determined in order to compare the observations made at different epochs .",
    "observations of the spectrophotometric standard star hr3454 were obtained for flux calibration , but the available spectrophotometry for this standard star @xcite has too coarse a resolution , 16  , to correct for the complex passband shape which arises from the combination of the echelle blaze and narrow - band h@xmath1 filter used for the single - order echelle observations . to circumvent these spectral response problems",
    "we have normalized our observations to the stellar continuum using a polynomial fit guided by the 2000 december 4 observations that were obtained with the multi - order echelle mode .",
    "these continuum fits constitute the largest source of uncertainty when comparing the background - subtracted stellar spectra .",
    "the continuum ",
    "normalized , background  subtracted spectra of the helix nebula central star have a s / n of @xmath035 in each 0.08    pixel . to improve the s / n ratio ,",
    "we have smoothed the spectra with a 5-pixel boxcar filter .",
    "the smoothed spectra are presented in figure  [ helix_spec ] .",
    "note that the s / n in the smoothed spectra does not appear to be the expected @xmath080 per 0.4    resolution element because the spectra contain systematic effects such as telluric absorption lines and uncertainties in the spectral responses .",
    "the stellar line profile is complex and may be variable ; therefore , we have used the nebular lines ( see figures  [ neb_subtract]a&b ) to define a reference frame , and will use heliocentric velocity ( ) throughout the remainder of this paper . because the nebular h@xmath1 line is blended with the telluric h@xmath1  emission we have used the [ ]  @xmath86583 line for this analysis , adopting a rest wavelength of @xmath86583.454   @xcite .",
    "we find that the nebular emission has two components , at @xmath92 and @xmath249@xmath102 , and therefore we assume the systemic velocity of the nebula is the average of these two velocities , roughly @xmath224 . since the nebular material originates from the white dwarf , we may assume that the time - averaged  for the white dwarf ( over a long period of time ) is also roughly @xmath224 .",
    "over the week - long baseline for these observations the h@xmath1 and possibly @xmath86560 and [ ]  @xmath86583 lines showed variation . in all stellar spectra",
    "there was a `` narrow '' h@xmath1 emission component with @xmath1110@xmath105  and fwhm of 80  superposed on the broad h@xmath1 absorption from the white dwarf atmosphere .",
    "the broad absorption is centered at @xmath116@xmath1010  slightly redder than the `` narrow '' emission component . in the 2000 december 11 spectrum",
    "the h@xmath1 line profile changed dramatically and showed an additional broad emission component superposed on the `` narrow '' emission component .",
    "to better highlight the quantitative difference from one epoch to another we have calculated the fractional difference spectrum , @xmath12 , for each epoch pair . in these fractional difference spectra ,",
    "shown in figure  [ helix_lincomb ] , the narrow emission component does not appear to vary ( i.e. , is not present ) while the variable emission component has a broad , flat - topped spectral shape with roughly 10% the brightness of the continuum .",
    "careful examination of the spectra also show that there are differences between the wings of the broad h@xmath1 absorption line . in order to determine whether these features are real or the result of the artifacts from the continuum normalization",
    ", we have calculated the fractional difference spectrum without normalizing the continuum for the epochs with the same instrumental setup , i.e. , december 8 and 11 .",
    "this fractional difference spectrum is presented in figure  [ helix_nonorm ] and shows that the low - level ( @xmath13 4% ) variations in the broad wings of the white dwarf h@xmath1 absorption are likely real , rather than an artifact from the continuum normalization .",
    "this conclusion is further strengthened by a similar analysis carried out for the observations of the standard star hr3454 made in these two epochs , which show no variation in the fractional difference spectrum within a part in 10@xmath14 .",
    "if the broad , flat - topped variable component is h@xmath1  emission , it is centered at @xmath1118@xmath1010  and has a full width of @xmath0315 . as the  @xmath86560 line is close to the h@xmath1  line , this broad emission component may also contain emission .",
    "the possibility that there is a component in the stellar spectrum is best demonstrated in figure  [ neb_subtract ] , where the blue shoulder of the stellar h@xmath1  emission ( figure  [ neb_subtract]c ) can be compared to the nebular emission ( figures  [ neb_subtract]a&b ) .",
    "the centroids and widths of this possible component and remaining h@xmath1  component may be measured from the fractional difference spectrum in figure 4 .",
    "finally , we note that a feature consistent with [ ]  @xmath86583 emission but centered at @xmath1515@xmath1010  with a fwhm of 105@xmath1020  appeared in the 2000 december 11 spectrum ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "the weaker [ ]  @xmath86548 line , however , was not detected .",
    "the velocities of all nebular and stellar lines are summarized in table  [ kin_sum ] .",
    "previous @xmath16 observations of the helix nebula show an unresolved x - ray source coincident with the central star .",
    "the spectrum of this source has a soft component ( @xmath130.2  kev ) consistent with emission from the 100,000  k photosphere of the white dwarf and a hard component which peaks at @xmath00.8 kev @xcite .",
    "recent higher spatial resolution @xmath17 observations by @xcite confirm that the emission in this hard x - ray component originates from an unresolved source coincident with the central white dwarf to within 05 .",
    "furthermore , the x - ray flux of this point source showed variations over a @xmath070 ksec time span with 3@xmath18 significance .",
    "they discuss the possible origins of the x - ray emission and conclude that the x - ray emission is likely due to coronal activity from an unseen dme ( dwarf m star with emission lines ) companion .",
    "our high - dispersion echelle spectra of the central star of the helix nebula show constant broad h@xmath1 absorption superposed with a narrow emission component .",
    "such an h@xmath1  profile has been commonly seen in hot white dwarfs @xcite and the emission component arises due to non - lte effects in the white dwarf atmosphere @xcite .    our observations also show , for the first time , variability in the optical spectrum of the central star of the helix nebula .",
    "this variable spectral component , spatially unresolved and coincident with the stellar spectrum , includes clear variability in the h@xmath1 emission and possible variability in the and [ ]  @xmath86583 emission . due to the close proximity of the h@xmath1 and @xmath86560 lines and the broad width of the variable emission component",
    ", we can not rule out the possibility that the variable emission is a combination of h@xmath1 and emission .",
    "are our observations consistent with h@xmath1 emission from the atmosphere of a dme stellar companion ? using an h@xmath1 flux scaled from the h@xmath19 emission line strength of the prototypical dme star yz cmi during a flare state @xcite and the flux density of the central star of the helix nebula @xcite",
    ", we find the observed intensity of the variable h@xmath1  emission is consistent with that of a flaring dme star .",
    "it must be noted , however , that the observed flux in the variable h@xmath1 emission alone can not distinguish among ( 1 ) jovian planets with fluorescing atmospheres at small distances from the hot white dwarf , ( 2 ) dwarf companion stars with fluorescing atmospheres at larger distances from the hot white dwarf , and ( 3 ) h@xmath1  emission which arises from a dme companion star of the white dwarf .",
    "an additional constraint is provided by the large width of the variable emission line .",
    "if this line is entirely due to h@xmath1  emission from a flourescing planetary or stellar companion , the observed width ( 315 ) is too large to be explained by orbital or rotational motion . on the other hand , dme stars during flares",
    "have been observed to show emission line variability with line widths as large as 300  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the x - ray flux of such stars in their quiescent state @xcite is similar to the flux observed from the helix nebula central star @xcite .",
    "observations by @xcite constrain that such a companion must have a spectral type later than m5 .",
    "it seems that a late - type dme companion is the best candidate to explain all observations of the helix nebula central star , with the x - ray observations during a quiescent state and the broad h@xmath1  emission from a flare",
    ". a dme companion , however , would not be able to explain the variable and [ ]  emission , if these lines are identified correctly and truly detected .",
    "since the presence of these lines is by no means certain , a dme companion remains the most viable candidate to explain all well established observations of the helix nebula central star .",
    "we may further examine whether the observed velocity and variation of the broad h@xmath1 component of the proposed orbiting dme companion are consistent with the orbital distance constrained by the optical and x - ray sizes .",
    "the size and position of the x - ray source measured with the @xmath17 acis - s image requires that the dme companion must orbit within 05 from the helix nebula central star . at a distance of 210 pc @xcite",
    ", 05 corresponds to 105 au . a 0.2 m@xmath20 dme star orbiting at 105 au from a 0.6 m@xmath20 pn",
    "central star would have an orbital velocity of 2.6 km  s@xmath5 and an orbital period of 1,200 yr . the observed velocity of the broad h@xmath1 emission does not conflict with this orbital velocity .    if the broad variable emission line is assumed to be a composite of roughly equal strength redshifted h@xmath1  and emission then the measurements on 11 december imply that a flourescing planetary or stellar companion may be viable candidates to explain the variable h@xmath1  emission .",
    "in this case the centroid of the portion of the variable emission that would be assigned to h@xmath1  implies that the orbital velocity of a flourescing planetary or stellar companion is at least 80 . for a jupiter mass companion orbiting a 0.6  white dwarf",
    "this places upper limits on the semi - major axis and period of @xmath00.08 au and @xmath011 days .",
    "for a 0.2  stellar companion the upper limits on the semi - major axis and period would be @xmath00.11 au and @xmath015 days .",
    "clearly , our detection of variability of the emission lines in the spectrum of the central star of the helix nebula has provided useful constraints on the possible origins of its x - ray emission .",
    "the limited number and moderate s / n of the observations presented here do not allow us to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a dme companion is a unique solution .",
    "follow - up spectroscopic monitoring of the central star in the helix nebula with high - dispersion ( r@xmath330,000 ) , and high s / n is needed to better identify the variable spectral features , and to establish their temporal behavior .",
    "measurement of the temporal behavior at just a few more epochs will quickly discriminate between flourescent emission ( from either a planetary or a stellar companion ) and emission that arises from a dme companion .",
    "other observations that might prove useful include , near - ir photometry to determine whether or not an ir excess from a low  mass stellar companion is present .",
    "it is important to confirm the binarity of the helix nebula central star .",
    "the helix nebula is one of the closest pn yet all prior attempts to search for a binary companion ( spectroscopic , photometric and @xmath21 wfpc2 imaging ) have found no evidence for a binary companion .",
    "it has been suggested that binary companions play significant roles in the aspherical mass loss of pn central stars , and thus are responsible for the wide range of pn morphologies observed .",
    "our results suggest that high - dispersion spectroscopic observations may provide a more sensitive probe for stellar companions in pns .",
    "a large sample of pne with a wide range of morphologies need to be observed so that we may assess the importance of binary central stars on the formation and evolution of pns .",
