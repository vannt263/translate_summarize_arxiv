    "it is well known that , in general , the act of measuring a quantum system necessarily disturb the system itself . a clear exemplification of this fact is given by joint ( or simultaneous ) measurements , _",
    "i.e. _ measurements in which one tries to simultaneously acquire information about two noncommuting observables from a single system . in this case , the possibility to sharply measure ( _ i.e. _ , to obtain measurement results not affected by more noise than the one intrinsically present into the system ) one observable is forbidden if a sharp measure of the other one is performed .",
    "nevertheless , information about both observables can be retrieved , paying the price of an extra noise in the statistics of the measurement results .",
    "an optimal joint measurement is the one introducing the minimum extra noise compatible with the laws of quantum mechanics .",
    "the first investigations in this issue can be traced back to the seminal paper by arthurs and kelly @xcite . there ,",
    "position and momentum observables have been considered and the minimum extra noise was found to be four times larger than the intrinsic noise related to the heisenberg uncertainty relation .",
    "notice that two points are crucial in their analysis : i ) the equality between the jointly inferred mean values and the mean values obtained if the measurements were performed non simultaneously is imposed ; ii ) the dependence on an _ a priori _ knowledge of the initial ensemble is needed , in order to adjust the relative sharpness of the two measurements .",
    "the usual implementation of an arthurs and kelly measurement concerns the field of quantum optics , in which two incompatible quadratures of the field are considered .",
    "typically , an heterodyne detection scheme ( or equivalently a double homodyne detection ) implements the joint measurement , however also a different strategy can be devised , in the case of fields described by a coherent state .",
    "one can in fact first generate two ( imperfect ) copies of the original state , via an optimal cloning process @xcite , and then measure the two quadratures one for each clones .",
    "both the strategies perform an optimal joint measurement .",
    "this fact , together with the quite general relationship between cloning and measurement @xcite , might lead to think that optimal cloning can be associated to optimal joint measurements .",
    "however , this is not the case in general . as an example , consider a qubit system and two pauli observables , for which again an optimal joint measurement involves an extra noise four times larger then the intrinsic one @xcite .",
    "an experimental implementation of such a joint measurement is reported in ref.@xcite , using an entangled two - photon state as information carrier from the very beginning .",
    "then , it is easy to demonstrate that optimal universal cloning for qubits @xcite does not allows to perform an optimal joint measurements of the two pauli observables ( see below ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that cloning machines are in general designed such to optimize the fidelity between input and output states , not such to optimize the joint measurement of a specific couple of noncommuting observables .",
    "it is the latter viewpoint that we will instead adopt in this work .",
    "more precisely , we will actually consider a further step , which can be understood in the spirit of state dependent cloning @xcite . recall that the latter cloning strategy , unlike the universal case , is specifically designed to act only on a particular class out of the whole hilbert space of the system ( _ e.g. _ , equatorial qubits ) . following an analogous strategy",
    ", we will design our process ( from now on called _ cloning of observables _ ) in order to clone and possibly jointly measure neither all possible observables nor two observables only , but rather the class generated by any linear combination of two observables .",
    "more in details , a cloning machine for the given set of observables is a device in which a signal qubit interacts with a probe qubit via a given unitary with the aim of reproducing the statistics of each observable on _ both _ the qubits at the output , independently of the signal qubit .",
    "the optimality of our cloner will be assessed by investigating the optimality of the joint measurement ( of the two observables generating the class ) , but the additional requirement of cloning the whole class of observables poses a clear distinction between a joint measurement and a cloning of observables .",
    "furthermore , unlike a joint measurement , our protocol is not focused only on the measurement process , which can actually not be performed .",
    "indeed , our approach is motivated , besides by the exploitation of a new aspect of the fundamental issue of quantum cloning , also in view of quantum communication purposes , in a repeater - like configuration .",
    "more specifically , one can address the transmission of information encoded , rather than in a set of states , in the statistics of a set of observables , independently of the quantum state at the input . in the following",
    "we will consider set of observables generated by two pauli operators , whereas for more general classes of observables we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ s : clom ] we describe the general concept of cloning machine for observables , introducing some basic properties .",
    "we point out in sec .",
    "[ s : ncom ] the impossibility of designing a perfect cloning machines for a class of two noncommuting observables , analogously to the impossibility of perfectly cloning two nonorthogonal states .",
    "then , an approximate cloning machine for this case will be introduced . in sec .",
    "[ s : jointclob ] we assess the optimality of such a cloning machine and compare it to a joint measurement process .",
    "we will see that , even if the cloning machine is designed to act on the whole class generated by two noncommuting observables , the same performances of a joint measurement can be attained , when one restricts the attention to the only two observables generating the class .",
    "[ s : esco ] closes the paper with some remarks .",
    "we consider a device in which a signal qubit ( say , qubit `` 1 '' ) is prepared in the ( unknown ) state @xmath0 and then interacts , via a given unitary @xmath1 , with a probe qubit ( `` 2 '' ) prepared in the known state @xmath2 . for a given class of qubit observables @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a subset of the real axis and @xmath5 $ ] , we introduce the concept of cloning as follows @xcite . a cloning machine for the class of observables @xmath6 is a triple @xmath7 such that @xmath8 where @xmath9 $ ] is the mean value of the observable @xmath10 at the input and @xmath11 \\quad { \\overline{\\rm x}}_2 \\equiv \\hbox{tr}_{12}\\left [ r\\ :   { \\mathbb{i}}\\otimes { { \\rm x}}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are the mean values of the same observable on the two output qubits ( see fig .",

    "a signal qubit prepared in the unknown state @xmath0 interacts , via a given unitary @xmath1 , with a probe qubit prepared in the known state @xmath2 .",
    "the class of observables @xmath6 is cloned if a measurement of any @xmath14 on either the two qubits at the output gives the same statistics as it was measured on the input signal qubit , _ independently _ on the initial qubit preparation @xmath0.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the above definition identifies the cloning of an observable with the cloning of its mean value .",
    "this is justified by the fact that for any single - qubit observable @xmath15 the cloning of the mean value is equivalent to the cloning of the whole statistics .",
    "in fact , any @xmath16 $ ] has at most two distinct eigenvalues @xmath17 , occurring with probability @xmath18 . for a degenerate eigenvalue",
    "the statement is trivial . for two distinct eigenvalues we have @xmath19 which , together with the normalization condition @xmath20 , proves the statement . in other words",
    ", we say that the class of observables @xmath6 has been cloned if a measurement of any @xmath14 on either the two qubits at the output gives the same statistics as it was measured on the input signal qubit , _ independently _ on the initial qubit preparation .    a remark about this choice is in order .",
    "in fact , in view of the duality among states and operators on an hilbert space , one may argue that a proper figure of merit to assess a cloning machine for observables would be a fidelity  like one .",
    "this is certainly true for the @xmath21-dimensional case , @xmath22 , while for qubit systems a proper assessment can be also made in term of mean  value duplication , which subsumes all the information carried by the signal .",
    "furthermore , in view of the possibility to realize a joint measurement via a cloner of observables , we recall that the eq .",
    "( [ avg ] ) is a standard requirement in such a scenario , as already recalled in sec .",
    "[ intro ]    before beginning our analysis let us illustrate a basic property of cloning machines , which follows from the definition , and which will be used throughout the paper .",
    "given a cloning machine @xmath23 , then @xmath24 is a cloning machine too , where @xmath25 and the class @xmath26 is formed by the observables @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",

    "in order to introduce cloning machines for a class of noncommuting observables let us consider the specific class @xmath41 .",
    "if a cloning machine @xmath42 existed , then the mean values as well as the statistics of any observable belonging to @xmath43 would be cloned at its output . as a consequence",
    ", one would jointly measure any two non - commuting observables belonging to @xmath43 ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath44 on the output signal and @xmath45 on the output probe ) without any added noise , thus violating the bounds imposed by quantum mechanics @xcite . generalizing this argument to any two ",
    "parameter class of noncommuting observables ( _ i.e. _ , to any class @xmath46 , with @xmath47 generic non - commuting observables ) , we then conclude that a cloning machine for a generic two  parameter class of noncommuting observables does not exist @xcite .",
    "this results resembles the no  cloning theorem for states , and it can actually be seen as its counterpart for cloning of observables .",
    "furthermore , it permits a comparison among cloning machines for observables and for states .",
    "let us write the generic input signal as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the bloch vector and @xmath51 is the identity operator . the state ",
    "cloning counterpart of the statement above can then be obtained by considering the class of observables @xmath52 : if a cloning machine @xmath42 existed , then the components @xmath53 and @xmath54 of bloch vector @xmath55 would be cloned for any input signal .",
    "the same situation occurs in the case of a two  parameter class generated by any pair of pauli operators . in other words",
    ", it is not possible to simultaneously copy a pair of components of the bloch vector of a generic state , even completely disregarding the third one @xcite .",
    "let us stress the fact that , even if a perfect cloning of observables could be performed ( for example , in the case of a class generated by commuting observables @xcite ) , correlations between the measurements would exist , otherwise state estimation limits would be overcame .",
    "now , a question arises on whether , analogously to state  cloning , we may introduce the concept of approximate cloning machines , _",
    "i.e. _ cloning of observables involving added noise .",
    "indeed this can be done and optimal approximate cloning machines corresponding to minimum added noise may be found as well .",
    "an approximate cloning machine for the class of observables @xmath6 is defined as the triple @xmath56 such that @xmath57 and @xmath58 _ i.e. _ @xmath59 = g_1 \\hbox{tr}_{12}\\left [ r\\ : { { \\rm x}}\\otimes { \\mathbb{i}}\\right ] = g_2 \\hbox{tr}_{12}\\left [ r\\ : { \\mathbb{i}}\\otimes { { \\rm x}}\\right ] \\label{appcl } \\:,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for any @xmath60 .",
    "the quantities @xmath61 , @xmath62 are independent on the input state and are referred to as the noises added by the cloning process .",
    "let us begin by again considering the class @xmath63 . by using the decomposition of a generic @xmath33 matrix in eq .",
    "( [ su4 ] ) one may attempt to find an approximate cloning machine considering only the action of the entangling kernel @xmath40 .",
    "unfortunately , it can be shown that no @xmath40 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 exist which realize approximate cloning for @xmath66 .",
    "a further single - qubit transformation should be introduced after @xmath40 . in particular , the unitary @xmath67 flips the pauli matrices @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath68 ) and permits the realization of an approximate cloning machine .",
    "indeed , the unitary @xmath69 realizes the approximate cloning machine @xmath70 with added noises @xmath71 in order to prove the cloning properties of @xmath72 let us start from the unitary @xmath73 , where @xmath40 is a generic entangling unitary of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ su4 ] ) .",

    "notice that other solutions for the @xmath82 s parameters may be found , which however give the same added noise as the one considered above .",
    "remarkably , similar cloning machines may be obtained for any class of observables generated by a pair of operators unitarily equivalent to @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "in fact , given the two - parameter classes of noncommuting observables defined as @xmath83 , with @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 generic unitary one has that an approximate cloning machine is given by the triple @xmath87 , with @xmath88 , with added noises @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the statement easily follows from the fact that @xmath70 is a cloning machine and from unitary covariance .",
    "similar results hold for any class of observables unitarily generated by any pair of ( noncommuting ) pauli operators .",
    "let us now consider if the approximate cloning machine for observables introduced above is optimal . in order to assess the quality and to define optimality of a triple @xmath89 we consider it as a tool to perform a joint measurements of noncommuting qubit observables @xcite .",
    "for example , consider the cloning machine @xmath90 and suppose to measure @xmath44 and @xmath45 on the two qubits at the output .",
    "we emphasize again that the cloning machine @xmath91 clones every observable belonging to @xmath43 , while we are now considering only the observables @xmath44 and @xmath45 which , in a sense , generate the class . the difference with a joint measurement specifically designed to measure only a couple of observables is evident . indeed",
    "_ a priori _ it is not clear at all if a cloning for observables , being in this sense far more general than a joint measurement , can reach the minimum disturbance necessary to perform an optimal joint measurement .",
    "nevertheless , this turns out to be the case , as we will see in the following .",
    "we have that the measured expectation values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 at the output are given by @xmath92 ( with @xmath93 ) , where the @xmath94 s are the input mean values .",
    "it follows that the measured uncertainties ( @xmath95 ) at the output are given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 denote the intrinsic uncertainties for the two quantities at the input . since for any pauli operators we have @xmath98 one may rewrites @xmath99 as a consequence",
    ", the measured uncertainty product is given by : @xmath100 since the arithmetic mean is bounded from below by the geometric mean we have @xmath101 with the equal sign iff @xmath102 , then it follows that @xmath103 if the initial signal is a minimum uncertainty state_i.e .",
    "_ , @xmath104one finally has that the measured uncertainty product is bounded by @xmath105 .",
    "notice that an optimal joint measurement corresponds to have @xmath106 . in our case",
    "this is realized when @xmath79 is chosen such that @xmath107 . as already recalled in sec .",
    "[ intro ] , such an _ a priori _ knowledge of the initial state is a standard requirement of joint measurements .",
    "therefore , since @xmath90 adds the minimum amount of noise in a joint measurement performed on minimum uncertainty states we conclude that it is an optimal approximate cloning machine for the class under investigation .",
    "an optimal approximate cloning machine for the more general class @xmath108 may be also defined , using the concept of joint measurement for noncanonical observables @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the comparison with a joint measurement of @xmath44 and @xmath45 performed with the aid of an optimal universal cloning machine for states @xcite .",
    "it is easy to show that the best result in this case is given by @xmath109 , indicating that cloning of observables is more effective than cloning of states to perform joint measurements ( for the case of three observables see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in fact",
    ", a symmetric cloning machine for states shrinks the whole bloch vector @xmath55 by a factor @xmath110 , whereas a cloning machine for observables shrinks the components @xmath53 and @xmath54 of @xmath111 only by a factor @xmath112 ( considering equal noise @xmath113 ) .",
    "notice that such a behavior is different from what happens in the case of continuous variables , for which the optimal covariant cloning of coherent states also provides the optimal joint measurements of two conjugated quadratures @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that coherent states are fully characterized by their complex amplitude , that is by the expectation values of two operators only , whereas the state of a qubit requires the knowledge of the three components of the bloch vector .    as a final remark",
    "we notice that if the requirement of universality is dropped , then cloning machines for states can be found that realize optimal approximate cloning of observables .",
    "for example , an approximate cloning machine for the two ",
    "parameter class @xmath114 can be obtained by considering a phase ",
    "covariant cloning for states @xcite .",
    "in order to clarify this point , let us recall that a phase ",
    "covariant cloning machine for states of the form uses a probe in the @xmath115 state and performs the following transformation : @xmath116 where , in general , @xmath117 $ ] . if we now consider the @xmath43 class it is straightforward to show that eqs .",
    "( [ appcl ] ) are satisfied for any @xmath74 using the machine ( [ eqc ] ) , with the optimal added noises given by eq .",
    "( [ addn2 ] ) . this can be intuitively understood by considering that a phase covariant cloning machine extracts the optimal information about states lying on the equatorial plane of the bloch sphere , which in turn include the eigenstates of @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "nevertheless , notice that there exist optimal approximate cloning machines for observables which do not coincide with phase ",
    "covariant cloning for states . as an example , considering a cloning machine with added noise @xmath120 and @xmath121 one would still obtain optimal cloning of observables , even if such a machine could not perform a phase covariant cloning of states .",
    "this remark shows that , in general , one can not simply transfer the results for state cloning into the cloning of observables case .",
    "we have analyzed in details the cloning for classes of observables with focus on classes generated by two noncommuting observables .",
