    "in recent years , the advent of various kinds of social networks , high - definition video streaming , and ubiquitous cloud storage entails large - scale storage in communication networks .",
    "cloud storage systems are able to meet the demand on large - scale storage capacity only with limited storage capacity of each storage node . moreover , the cloud storage systems improve reliability of data storage and recovery since they are robust to failures of individual storage nodes to a certain degree",
    ". the robustness also makes repair and maintenance easy when an appropriate network coding technique is adopted .    theoretically , successful recovery in a cloud storage system is possible if and only if the corresponding max - flow or min - cut from the storage nodes is greater than or equal to the size of the original data object . to implement this feature , given two positive integers",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 , a @xmath4 maximum distance separable ( mds ) code can be used to encode and store the original data into @xmath3 storage nodes such that recovery of the original data is possible with @xmath2 out of @xmath3 nodes . for practical implementations , erasure coding is known to be more reliable than duplication of the file @xcite .",
    "reed - solomon code @xcite is the most popular one for practical implementation of mds codes and reed - solomon code with information dispersal algorithm ( ida ) for distributed storage was investigated in @xcite .",
    "fountain codes@xcite and low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) @xcite are also known to have approximate mds properties .",
    "especially , raptor code , the first known class of fountain codes as well as online codes @xcite , is another example of rateless erasure codes and provides linear time complexity of encoding and decoding .",
    "when a storage node fails , the code repairing problem in a distributed storage system is addressed in @xcite where the code repairing techniques are categorized into exact repair , functional repair , and exact repair of systematic parts .",
    "the blocks newly reconstructed by the functional repair preserve the mds property and enable data recovery , but they are not the same as the original blocks . on the contrary , in the exact repair , the failed blocks are exactly reconstructed .",
    "the exact repair of systematic parts is a hybrid repair model standing between the functional repair and the exact repair .",
    "tthe functional repair problem in distributed storage systems was studied in @xcite , interpreting the problem as a multicasting problem over an information flow graph . for the exact repair ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the optimal minimum bandwidth regenerating ( mbr ) code can be found for @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath3 are the number of surviving nodes and the number of storage nodes , respectively .",
    "for the exact repair , the exact minimum storage regenerating ( msr ) code based on interference alignment was proposed in @xcite , when @xmath7 and @xmath8 where @xmath2 is the minimum number of nodes required for data recovery .",
    "the capacity of multicast networks with network coding was given in the pioneering work of ahlswede et al .",
    "it was also shown in @xcite that the random linear network coding over a sufficiently large finite field asymptotically achieved the multicast capacity .",
    "for distributed storage , network coding was introduced in @xcite for wireless sensor network . in @xcite ,",
    "decentralized erasure codes inspired by network coding on random bipartite graphs were proposed for distributed multiple sources and their applications to sensor networks were presented .",
    "another linear technique to increases data persistence in wireless sensor networks was proposed and compared to other codes when the positions and topology of nodes were unknown in @xcite .",
    "pyramid codes for flexibly exploiting the tradeoffs between total storage space and access efficiency in a distributed storage system was investigated in @xcite . in @xcite , partial network coding ( pnc )",
    "generalizing network coding was investigated for data collection in distributed sensor networks . for a joint storage and transmission problem",
    ", @xcite showed that a linear coding strategy with file splitting ( instead of coding ) achieved optimality in total cost including the individual cost of updating , storing and retrieving .",
    "other key issues on network codes for distributed storage can be referred to @xcite .    for an efficient utilization of limited storage capacity , resource allocation in distributed storage systems has been actively explored .",
    "a storage allocation problem under a constraint of total storage capacity was studied in @xcite , where the recovery probability at the data collector was analyzed when the link connections from each node to the data collector are modeled as independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "bernoulli random variables with parameter @xmath9 .",
    "it was found in @xcite that the maximal symmetric allocation that equally distributes the total storage capacity to the storage nodes is optimal if the total storage budget is large enough .",
    "the gap between the maximal symmetric allocation and the optimal solution vanishes as the total number of storage nodes grows , when @xmath10 , where @xmath1 is the normalized total storage capacity .",
    "if the total storage budget is small , the minimal allocation was shown to be optimal , where the total storage budget is distributed to the minimized number of storage nodes only . in @xcite ,",
    "these results were extended to a distributed storage system with heterogeneous links where the connection probability from node @xmath11 to the data collector is @xmath12 .",
    "most of the previous papers on network coding in distributed storage systems rely mainly on simple graph networks with reliable links .",
    "system design and performance analysis of distributed storage systems in fading channels is crucial .",
    "for example , diversity gains by multiple antennas or multiple nodes @xcite in distributed storage systems are required to be properly analyzed and evaluated in fading channels .",
    "however , there have been very few studies on distributed storage allocation with non - reliable fading links so far .",
    "although some works , such as @xcite , tried to take account of unreliable links with bernoulli random variables , they failed to exactly account for the key features of wireless links such as channel fading .",
    "for example , diversity gains by multiple antennas or cooperative nodes @xcite in distributed storage systems are required to be properly analyzed and evaluated in fading channels . despite the importance of system design and performance analysis of distributed storage systems in fading channels , there have been few studies on distributed storage allocation with non - reliable fading links so far .",
    "in this context , we consider a wireless cloud storage system where data storage and recovery are carried out through wireless fading channels .",
    "a personal cloud storage system might be a good application of our system model .",
    "contrary to public cloud storage on internet like dropbox or google drive , users directly access nearby wireless storage to store or retrieve their data in a personal cloud storage system . apparently , distributed storage techniques and resource allocation under limited storage space are key techniques enabling personal wireless cloud storage systems . in this regard ,",
    "the problem of storing and retrieving a file over multiple storage devices under limited sum storage capacity is also a fundamental issue to be addressed , from which we can identify the optimal file portions to store at each storage device . in system design or deployment ,",
    "the problem reveals the optimal storage size at each storage device under a limited budget of total available storage space .",
    "a cloud edge computing system can also be an extended application .",
    "cloud edge computing includes the processes of distributing input data generated from a user to nearby computing entities ( or devices ) and delivering output data from the computing entities to the user .",
    "the processes are basically identical with the processes of storing and retrieving data over distributed storage devices .",
    "therefore , our system model can be used as a framework for wireless cloud edge computing system .    in our system model",
    ", the recovery failure event occurs either when a data object is not correctly stored at the distributed storage nodes or when the data recovery at the collector fails .",
    "we analyze and characterize recovery failure probability in an asymptotic sense for high snr regime and low snr regime , and quantify the effect of limited storage capacity on the asymptotic recovery failure probability in high snr regime .",
    "the contributions of this paper are summarized as follows .",
    "* we find the _ asymptotically _ optimal storage allocation under a constraint of total storage capacity for high snr regime and low snr regime . * using exponential equality analysis",
    ", we show that the optimal allocation strategy for high snr regime is maximal symmetric spreading of the total storage budget across the distributed storage nodes . *",
    "we show that for low snr regime , the minimal allocation with @xmath0 complete and 1 incomplete storage nodes is optimal . in the minimal allocation , @xmath13 storage budget , which is the remaining storage budget after allocating @xmath14 budget to @xmath14 storage nodes ,",
    "is not required to be allocated . * in low snr regime ,",
    "the storing phase becomes the performance bottleneck and thus the recovery failure probability mainly depends on the cardinality of the decoding set of which elements are the storage nodes that have stored the object successfully .",
    "* based on numerical investigation , we show that in intermediate snr , a balance allocation between the minimal allocation and the maximal symmetric allocation would not be necessary if we properly switch them according to snr .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present our system model and notations about the exponential equality .",
    "section iii describes how the wireless cloud storage system operate .",

    "[ fig : system ] , the number of storage nodes is set to @xmath15 .",
    "data source , data collector , and storage nodes are denoted by @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the collector node recovers the stored data from the storage nodes .",
    "if we consider the scenario when a mobile user stores its data on cloud storage , the collector node will be the same as the data source , so the direct link from the source node to the data collector does not exist . the channel gain from node @xmath11 to node @xmath19 is denoted by @xmath20 and follows the complex gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance , i.e. , @xmath21 . for simplicity , we assume all channels independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) and the path loss are ignored , but the result of this paper can be extended to a general case with ease . to facilitate tractable analysis without losing key insights on system design , we assume i.i.d",
    ". channels . moreover ,",
    "if storage nodes are not close one another in a rich scattering environment , the independent channel model can be effective.the analytic framework developed in i.i.d .",
    "channels will be also useful in non i.i.d . channels . for file",
    "storing and recovery , a file is divided into many data blocks and the storing and recovery processes are carried out for each data block . because mobility of both storage devices and user is limited in personal cloud storage systems , the doppler spread is not likely to be large .",
    "for example , in low mobility environments ( i.e , moving speed is less than 5 m / sec ) , the coherent time becomes approximately 20 ms with 2.4ghz carrier frequency . on the other hand ,",
    "symbol duration is on the order of tens of microseconds and the supported data rate reaches more than 1 gbps in current wireless communication protocols such as wi - fi direct .",
    "consequently , each data block size can be as large as up to 2.5 mbytes under the coherent time requirement .",
    "this block size is large enough to implement ideal mds coding and given the fact that storage devices like hdd or ssd use block size of 4 kb ",
    "2,048 kb , the requirement of coherence time can be readily met for each data block .",
    "therefore , we assume that the coherence time is longer than each storage period and recovery period for each data block and thus the channel gains do not change during each period but the channel gains independently change between the periods .    an additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) is denoted by @xmath22 and follows the complex gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath24 .",
    "the average signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of a link is denoted as @xmath25 and the amount of coded data stored in storage node @xmath26 is denoted as @xmath27 .    in our model",
    ", each storage node does not have an individual restriction on the storage size but the maximum amount of data stored at each storage node is @xmath1 because the total storage budget is limited to @xmath1 such that @xmath28 .",
    "we assume that the size of data object is normalized to be unit compared to the total storage capacity @xmath1 as in other literature @xcite , which simplifies design and analysis of distributed storage systems .",
    "a data object corresponds to a divided data block and the recovery probability to be analyzed is for each data block , not for the whole file .",
    "total storage constraint @xmath1 and allocated budget @xmath27 is also identically used for a data block consisting the file because they are already normalized values compared to the original data . in other words , @xmath27 can also denotes the amount of mds coded fraction stored in storage node @xmath11 .      as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] , the storage and recovery operation is constituted by two basic phases .",
    "the first one is for storing data object in the distributed storage nodes and the second one is for recovering the stored data .",
    "these two phases are decoupled in time since the stored data are recovered later although the first phase affects the data recovery in the second phase .",
    "that is , the storage phase and the recovery phase are not concurrently entered into .    1 .",
    "storage phase : the source node broadcasts a data object to the cloud storage nodes to store the data object during a given time period .",
    "if a storage node has successfully decoded the broadcast data object from the source , the storage node converts the decoded data object into suitable mds coded blocks as much as its allocated storage size @xmath27 , and stores it .",
    "storage node @xmath11 successfully decodes the data object from the source node only when the instantaneous mutual information between the source node and storage node @xmath11 is greater than or equal to the required rate of the data object , i.e. , @xmath29 the value of threshold @xmath30 depends on the adopted modulation and coding scheme ( mcs ) and bandwidth for data transmission .",
    "for example , a typical range of required snr in 802.11n wi - fi is around from 10 to 30 db @xcite .",
    "taking account of specific system parameters of the adopted wireless communication protocol , the threshold @xmath30 corresponding to a required snr value can be computed .",
    "the amount of mds coded data stored at node @xmath31 is equal to its allocated storage size @xmath27 , where @xmath32 is the decoding set whose elements are the storage nodes which have successfully decoded the broadcast data object . if @xmath33 , the data object is not properly stored because the data object can not be properly recovered from the stored mds coded data @xcite . on the other hand , if @xmath34 , the collector has a chance to properly recover the data object from the stored mds coded data , depending on channel conditions from the storage nodes to the collector .",
    "note that instead of mds coding , random linear coding over a sufficiently large field can be used for data object recovery @xcite .",
    "recovery phase : when the data collector wants to recover the data object , it requests the storage nodes in the decoding set to send the mds coded blocks of the stored data . the storage phase and the recovery phase are assumed to have the same time length for simplicity .",
    "let @xmath35 be the index of the storage node in the decoding set .",
    "they are indexed in descending order of the channel power gain from the storage node to the collector such that @xmath36 .",
    "then , storage node @xmath37 transmits during @xmath38 fraction of the time period allocated for the recovery phase , where @xmath38 varies with the cardinality of the decoding set and has to satisfy @xmath39 and @xmath40 which is a constraint from the property of mds code .",
    "the data collector is assumed to know the index and the stored data size of each storage node by proper signaling with the storage nodes . with the help of pilot symbols from each storage node in the decoding set , the data collector estimates the channel gains from the storage node . to focus on developing the optimal distributed caching strategy , we assume perfect channel state information at the data collector and discard the signaling overhead .",
    "based on the channel gains , the data collector determines the time fractions , @xmath41 , by solving the following optimization problem : @xmath42 the optimized value of @xmath43 is given by @xmath44\\nonumber\\\\ & + \\left(1-\\sigma_{\\hat{j}=1}^{i-1}a_{\\hat{j}}\\right)\\cdot\\textbf{1}\\left[\\sigma_{\\hat{j}=1}^{i}a_{\\hat{j}}>1 \\text { and } \\sigma_{\\hat{j}=1}^{i-1}a_{\\hat{j}}\\leq1 \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the indicator function which returns 1 if the argument is true or 0 otherwise , which suggests that longer transmission time is allocated to the storage node with a stronger channel gain under the storage constraint and the transmit time constraint . + according to the determined @xmath41 , the data collector receives the stored mds coded block from storage node @xmath46 during the @xmath47 time portion",
    ". then , it moves on to storage node @xmath48 and receives the stored mds coded block during @xmath49 . in this way",
