    "has garnered much recent attention due to its biological and technological importance @xcite .",
    "confinement can lead to changes in both structural and dynamical properties caused by the interaction with a surface and/or a truncation of the bulk correlation length .",
    "moreover these changes depend on whether the interactions of water with the wall particles are hydrophilic or hydrophobic  @xcite .",
    "one of the motivations for studying two different kinds of interactions arises from studies of protein folding , since the folding of a protein is influenced by its hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions with water @xcite .",

    "has been experimentally observed @xcite .",
    "water confined in vycor @xcite has at least two different dynamical regimes arising from the slow dynamics of water near the surface and fast dynamics of water far away from the surfaces @xcite .",
    "one anomaly hypothesized to occur in supercooled water is the emergence of a phase transition line separating liquid states of different densities . this phenomenon is called a liquid - liquid ( ll ) phase transition @xcite .",
    "a ll transition has been seen in a variety of simulation models of water @xcite , but is difficult to observe experimentally due to the propensity of ice to nucleate at temperatures where a transition is expected .",
    "nonetheless , indirect evidence of a transition has been found @xcite .",
    "studies of some simple models of liquid also show a ll phase transition @xcite .",
    "bulk water simulations using the tip5p potential @xcite indicate the presence of a ll phase transition ending in a second critical point at @xmath6  k and @xmath7  g/@xmath8 @xcite . a ll phase transition has been suggested based on simulations using the st2 potential confined between smooth plates @xcite .",
    "a liquid - to - amorphous transition is seen in simulations using the tip4p potential @xcite confined in carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical work @xcite suggests that hydrophobic confinement suppresses the ll transition to lower @xmath1 .",
    "here we aim to determine how confinement between smooth hydrophobic walls affects the location of the the ll critical point as well as the overall thermodynamic , dynamic and structural properties .",

    "computer simulation studies show that models of water can crystallize into different crystalline forms when confined between surfaces @xcite .",
    "for example , monolayer ice was found in simulations using the tip5p model of water @xcite . by applying an electric field along lateral directions ( directions perpendicular to the confinement direction ) another crystalline structure for three molecular layers of water confined between two silica plates was found @xcite . also , bilayer hexagonal ice was found in simulations using the tip4p model @xcite . in general these simulations",

    "one of the problems when dealing with liquids in a confined geometry is how to define the density in a consistent way . using a geometric definition",
    "@xmath52 ( where @xmath53 is the water molecule mass ) underestimates the effective density since the repulsive interactions with the walls prevent molecules from coming too close to the walls .",
    "hence we want to quantify the effective distance @xmath54 perpendicular to the walls accessible to the water molecules ( fig .  1 ) , and thus obtain a definition for @xmath41 which is more readily comparable with the density of a bulk system .",
    "to estimate @xmath54 , we calculate the density profile @xmath55 defined as the density of oxygen centers at @xmath56 , shown in fig .",
    "[ rho - z ] for different temperatures and densities . in all cases",
    "studied , we observe that molecules can not access the total available space between the walls , and that the accessible space along the transverse direction does not strongly depend on @xmath1 and @xmath41 .",

    "the two maxima next to the walls are the result of water - wall interaction .",
    "as density decreases below @xmath62  g/@xmath8 , the central maximum becomes nearly uniform and , at density @xmath64  g/@xmath8 , only the two maxima located next to the walls remain .",
    "this density corresponds to the least structured liquid . upon further expansion ,",
    "the structure of the liquid starts to increase since the bilayer splits into two sublayers for the lowest density @xmath65g/@xmath8 . as we will see in the next section",
    ", @xmath59  k is below the temperature of maximum density ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "hence the increase in the structure upon expansion corresponds to the anomalous decrease in entropy upon expansion found in bulk water below the @xmath67 , @xmath68    figure  [ rho - z](b ) shows the effect on @xmath55 of changing @xmath41 at higher @xmath1 , @xmath69  k. the densities in fig .",

    "[ rho - z](a ) and refrho - z(b ) shows that , at the lowest @xmath41 studied , the layers of the bilayer structured liquid at @xmath69  k do not split into two sub - layers , as is the case of @xmath59  k since @xmath69 lies above the @xmath67 .",
    "in fact , we find that at @xmath59  k the sublayers present at @xmath65  g/@xmath8 merge into a single layer at @xmath64  g/@xmath8 , and the resulting @xmath55 resembles that shown in fig .",

    "the molecules are not able to displace perpendicular to the walls and the density profile is almost @xmath1 independent .",
    "indeed , the liquid has a trilayer structure at all @xmath1 studied .",
    "next we test how confinement affects the location in the @xmath72 phase diagram of the ll phase transition line and the second critical point found in bulk water simulations using the tip5p model @xcite .",
    "to determine the phase behavior , we evaluate @xmath73 as a function of @xmath41 .",
    "if there is a second ll phase critical point , then it should manifest itself in a van der waals `` loop '' along isothermal paths at low @xmath1 .    unlike bulk liquid systems",
    ", one must be careful to interpret separately the results involving the lateral pressure @xmath74 and those involving the transverse pressure @xmath47 , since the thermodynamic averages of these quantities will usually be different .",
    "phase separation will only be apparent in @xmath74 , since the separation of the plates is too small to allow for the existence of two distinct phases in the transverse direction . in figs .",
    "[ phased](a ) and [ phased](b ) , we show @xmath47 and the lateral pressure @xmath74 as functions of density along all seven isotherms .",
    "since there can be no phase separation in the transverse direction , @xmath47 is a monotonically increasing function of the density ( fig .",
    "[ phased](a ) ) .",
    "@xmath74 is also a monotonic increasing function of @xmath41 , but as @xmath1 decreases , the isotherms of @xmath74 become `` flatter '' in the region near @xmath75  g/@xmath8 ( fig .  [ phased](b ) ) .",
    "the presence of this region is consistent with the possible existence of a van der waals loop at lower @xmath1 and , therefore , is consistent with the possible existence of a ll phase transition line ending at a second critical point at a value of @xmath1 lower than 220  k , the lowest simulated temperature . at 220",
    "k no phase separation occurs , consistent with the simulations of bulk water where the same tip5p potential gives a second critical point with @xmath76  k @xcite . while we are unable to simulate the temperatures below @xmath77 of the bulk system , comparison of the lowest @xmath1 isotherm with that of ref .",
    "@xcite suggests that we will need to go well below the bulk @xmath77 to see phase separation .",
    "thus our results suggest that the presence of hydrophobic walls shifts a possible second critical point to lower @xmath1 . along an isothermal path",
    ", the critical point can be located by the point where the slope @xmath78 and curvature @xmath79 simultaneously equal zero .",
    "we can estimate this point by plotting the values of the minimum slopes along each isotherm and extrapolating the slopes to find the @xmath1 at which the slope is zero .",

    "similar behavior is observed for @xmath82 at large @xmath41 .",
    "however , for @xmath83  g/@xmath8  @xmath84  g/@xmath8 , the isochores in the @xmath85 plane display minima , indicating the presence of a @xmath67 line , defined as the locus of points where @xmath86 @xcite . for @xmath87 , water confined between hydrophobic walls is anomalous , i.e. , it becomes less dense upon cooling .",

    "[ tmd - plot ] .",
    "a @xmath88  k temperature shift in the @xmath66 of confined water overlaps these loci .",
    "thus the effect of the hydrophobic walls in our system seems to be to shift the @xmath72 phase diagram by @xmath89  k with respect to bulk water .",
    "this is consistent with the second critical point shifting to lower @xmath1 .",
    "figure  [ u - rho ] shows the calculated potential energy for the lowest simulated temperature @xmath39  k. we note two minima for the densities around @xmath65g/@xmath8 and @xmath90g/@xmath8 respectively .",
    "since the free energy @xmath91 is given by @xmath92 where @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 are the kinetic energy , potential energy and entropy respectively , at small @xmath1 an extremum in @xmath94 suggests an extremum in @xmath91 .",

    "however , we find that if we calculate @xmath104 for only @xmath111  nm @xmath112  nm ( which corresponds to the location of the central layer ) , then @xmath104 at low-@xmath41 and high-@xmath41 resemble @xmath108 for bulk water at both low and high densities respectively .",
    "thus the evolution of the structure parallel to the walls of the central layer mimics the structural changes when going from low - density bulk water to high - density bulk water .",

    "the emergence of a peak at @xmath116  nm on heating at 1.25  g/@xmath124 is in contrast to the behavior of bulk water , where the disappearance of the peaks at 0.45 and 0.7 nm gives rise to nearly featureless behavior of @xmath108 beyond the first peak ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "for low temperature , the maxima occur at the same density for @xmath133 and @xmath154 .",

    "the shift to lower temperature compared to the bulk water can be understood qualitatively .",
    "since the confinement walls do not form any hydrogen bonds with water molecules the average number of hydrogen bonds per molecule in confined system is smaller than in bulk water .",
    "this is analogous to having bulk water at high temperatures .",
    "we do not see a ll phase transition for the state points we have been able to simulate , but we do see a pronounced inflection in the @xmath24 isotherms ( fig .  [ phased ] ) , which is consistent with a ll phase transition at lower @xmath1 .",
    "since the phase diagram is shifted @xmath161  k lower in temperature , our results are consistent with the possibility that there indeed is a ll transition at a temperature too low to simulate .",
    "this shift of thermodynamics qualitatively agrees with the theoretical predictions of ref .",
    "the structure of confined water is similar to the structure bulk water at a lower density , and shows a similar evolution of the structure with changes in density and temperature . at a given temperature , as the density increases , water changes from a bilayer liquid ( at low density ) to a trilayer liquid ( at high density ) .",
    "we find that the confinement affects the translational diffusion as well as the rotational motion of water molecules .",
