    "a study of the dependence of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of quasars on their luminosity and/or on cosmic epoch is particularly important for understanding the quasar phenomenon . in the optical - to - x - ray regime",
    ", the sed can be characterized by the broad band spectral index between 2500 and 2kev , which is defined as @xmath1 .",
    "quasars are known to exhibit strong luminosity evolution in the x - ray and the optical wave bands ( e.g.  boyle 1994 )",
    ". however , there have been controversial discussions in the past as to whether the evolution law is the same in these two energy bands . a dependence of on redshift or optical luminosity would indicate different evolution in the optical and the x - ray regime .",
    "further , if depends on optical luminosity , this is equivalent to a non - linear relationship between x - ray and optical luminosity ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) .",
    "while most of the analyses agree on the result that is redshift independent , it has been claimed that increases with @xmath0 , which implies that the objects with high optical luminosities are under - luminous in x - rays compared to their low luminosity counterparts ( avni & tananbaum 1982 , 1986 ; kriss & canizares 1985 ; wilkes  1994 ; avni  1995 ; green  1995 ) .",
    "generally , for a functional dependence of the form @xmath4 , a canonical slope of @xmath5 was obtained , which is equivalent to a non - linear relation of the form @xmath6 .    based on monte carlo simulations , chanan ( 1983 )",
    "suggested that a non - linear relation might arise even for an intrinsically linear dependence from observational flux limits and the large intrinsic scatter in the data .",
    "thus , the observed @xmath0 correlation should not be considered as an underlying physical reality .",
    "the author also claimed that the choice of @xmath0 as the independent variable is not justified .",
    "however , kriss & canizares ( 1985 ) criticized these results by pointing out that they depend critically on the assumption of a gaussian distribution for the luminosity functions .",
    "a study by la  franca  ( 1995 ) reinforced the idea of a linear relationship between the x - ray and the optical luminosity for quasars .",
    "they applied a regression algorithm to a large sample of quasars detected with _",
    "einstein _ , which accounts for errors in both variables and the intrinsic scatter in the data , and found @xmath7 .",
    "in a recent study of rosat detected quasars by brinkmann  ( 1997 ) , it has been shown by means of a simple argument that an apparent correlation between and @xmath8 can indeed emerge even for intrinsically uncorrelated variables .",
    "motivated by this idea , as well as by recent improvements concerning the shape of the quasar luminosity functions in the optical and the x - ray regime , we carry out a detailed study of this controversial problem by means of a monte carlo analysis .",
    "we mostly use the logarithms of luminosities and denote them as @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we use @xmath11 , @xmath12 throughout this paper .",
    "all errors quoted are at the @xmath13 level unless mentioned otherwise .",
    "we first describe the assumed parametric form of the multivariate distribution @xmath14 ( , , ) , which we use in the simulations . in previous studies",
    "( e.g.  avni & tananbaum 1982 , 1986 ; kriss & canizares 1985 ) @xmath14 ( , , ) is commonly expressed as the product of the luminosity function ( lf hereafter ) of the primary luminosity ( either or ) and the conditional distribution function of the secondary luminosity .",
    "the conditional distribution function determines the expected value of the secondary luminosity by assuming a functional dependence between the two luminosities and intrinsic dispersion . in previous models ,",
    "the dispersion of was attributed to the dispersion in the secondary luminosity alone . in this paper",
    "we use a generalized description of the multivariate distribution function .",
    "we assume that both luminosities show intrinsic dispersion instead of the secondary luminosity only .",
    "we introduce _ intrinsic _ optical and x - ray luminosities and .",
    "the observed luminosities and are the intrinsic luminosities modified by various mechanisms which produce a large scatter .",
    "the luminosities and are distributed according to their respective luminosity functions , and .",
    "although and are not directly observable , their ratio , i.e.  the _ intrinsic _ , which is defined as @xmath15 can be approximated by the mean of the observed distribution . as indicated by the observed correlation between and , and",
    "are physically related . assuming a redshift - independent relationship of the form @xmath16 we get an _ intrinsic _ dependence of on , @xmath17 if @xmath18 , we have @xmath19 , i.e.is independent of the luminosities _ intrinsically_.    the _ observed _ optical and x - ray luminosities of a quasar are then @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 quantify the scatter around the intrinsic luminosities in the optical and the x - ray band , respectively . the dispersion of can now be attributed to the dispersions in both and . assuming that @xmath21 and @xmath22 are independent , we have$ ] with @xmath23 from eq.[eq : b ] and @xmath24 . if @xmath25 then @xmath26 . the same applies for in eq.[eq : h ] . ]",
    "@xmath27 , \\label{eq : f}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the dispersion of .    based on this generalized scenario ,",
    "the multivariate distribution function @xmath29 can be replaced by a distribution function depending on , , , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the luminosity function for , @xmath32 is a @xmath33-function with @xmath34 from eq.[eq : b ] , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the conditional distribution functions for @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively . in the following",
    "we describe these terms as they were implemented in the monte carlo analysis .",
    "we assume that both luminosity dispersions , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , are independent of luminosity and redshift , and that @xmath35 and @xmath36 are given by gaussian distributions with means of zero , and standard deviations @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "thus , the distribution of is gaussian with standard deviation @xmath39 @xmath40 is available from observational data , ranging from 0.15 to 0.2 ( e.g.  avni  1995 , yuan  1998 ) .",
    "we define the parameter as the ratio of the standard deviations of the optical to the x - ray luminosity dispersions , @xmath41 then , given and @xmath40 , and can be determined using eq.[eq : h ] .",
    "another input is the lf @xmath42 , which is not directly observable . assuming a @xmath43-dependent power law for @xmath42 and a gaussian distribution for @xmath35 , it can be shown that the lf for the observed luminosity has the same functional form and evolution as that for except close to the low - luminosity cutoff .",
    "therefore , it is natural to approximate @xmath44 by the observed optical luminosity function ( olf ) and its evolution .",
    "if @xmath21 is small , @xmath45 reduces to the observed olf .    we assume pure luminosity evolution for quasars . using the functional form of the olf as given by boyle ( 1994 ) , which was derived from the uvx sample",
    ", we parameterize @xmath42 by a broken power law with @xmath46 for @xmath47 and @xmath48 for @xmath49 , and @xmath50(=0)@xmath51 , @xmath52 , for @xmath53 .",
    "a low - luminosity cutoff was applied at @xmath54 at @xmath55 for .",
    "it should be noted that and are equivalent and interchangeable in this model .",
    "eq.[eq : g ] can also be expressed in terms of , in which case the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) has to be used instead of olf .",
    "the monte carlo analysis was performed by generating a sample of quasars with _ z _ , , and as follows : + first , a redshift _ z _ was drawn from a given range @xmath56 satisfying @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the volumes within @xmath60 and @xmath56 , respectively , and @xmath61 is a random number between 0 and 1 . the volume element in co - moving space",
    "is given by ( for @xmath62 ) @xmath63 then , a second random number @xmath64 was calculated and the intrinsic luminosity at the optical band @xmath65 was determined such that @xmath66 , with the luminosity function @xmath67 as specified above .",
    "after that , the expected x - ray luminosity @xmath68 was obtained using eq.[eq : a ] for a given .",
    "the _ observed _ optical and x - ray luminosities , and , are then drawn from the gaussian distribution functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding fluxes were calculated from the luminosities assuming @xmath71 and @xmath72 for the k - corrections , respectively .",
    "an object was accepted , if the fluxes were above the given flux limits . in general",
    "we simulated optically selected samples assuming a threshold magnitude @xmath73 = 20 . if the objects turned out to have an x - ray flux below the assumed x - ray flux limit they were treated as ` non - detections ' .",
    "the above procedure was repeated until a sample comprising 300 objects was obtained . for each object , was calculated from the simulated and .",
    "we then investigated the relationship by means of a spearman rank correlation test and least - square linear regression analysis . for a specific set of parameters of the quasar population",
    ", we carried out 10 independent trials and acquired 10 samples .",
    "all statistical quantities derived below are the mean of the individual values of the 10 samples , along with the statistical uncertainty for the mean .      as the first and simplest case we assumed the intrinsic and in eqs.[eq : c ] and [ eq : h ] to be constant , i.e. independent of luminosity . in accordance with observational results we used @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we considered 20 values of the -parameter from @xmath76 to @xmath77 , which are sampled evenly on a logarithmic scale .",
    "eq.[eq : h ] then determines the dispersions and .",
    "we investigated optically selected samples with a size of @xmath78 and a limiting magnitude @xmath79 . in a first attempt",
    ", we restrict our analysis to samples at a fixed redshift ( @xmath80 ) , for which the results give an insight into the physical problem , and then we present cases for samples in larger redshift ranges .",
    "the spearman correlation coefficients @xmath81 are plotted in fig.1 as open squares for 20 different values , with the typical @xmath13 error indicated for illustration .",
    "the probability levels @xmath82 and 0.001 , at which the ` no correlation ' hypothesis is ruled out , are shown at the corresponding @xmath81 ( @xmath83 ) as dotted and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "despite of the luminosity independence of the intrinsic mean the results show the emergence of a positive correlation with increasing , which becomes significant for @xmath84 .",
    "in fig.2 we show an example of an versus plot for a simulated sample with @xmath85 .",
    "the dashed line represents a constant x - ray luminosity ( = 27.2 ) .",
    "obviously , the simulation indicates a much sharper cutoff in x - ray luminosity compared to optical luminosity , which has already been noted by brinkmann  ( 1997 ) for observed data .",
    "now we consider the effects of thresholds in the x - ray observations . at a redshift of @xmath43=1 a luminosity threshold of @xmath86at 2kev indicated by",
    "the dotted line in fig.2 corresponds to a flux limit of @xmath87 in the 0.52kev band .",
    "objects below this line have @xmath88 and can thus be ` detected ' in x - rays ; whereas the rest with @xmath89 are ` non - detections ' .",
    "when only the ` detections ' are considered , the x - ray thresholds can enhance the apparent correlation significantly , as can be inferred from the figure .",
    "the results are independent of redshift , which changes only the range of optical luminosities .",
    "we now consider samples with a redshift range of @xmath90 .",
    "the results of the correlation analysis are added to fig.1 for the case without ( filled circles ) and with an x - ray threshold ( open circles ) .",
    "we find almost the same results as for the sample at fixed redshift .",
    "the slopes @xmath91 obtained by fitting a linear @xmath92 relation to the simulated samples , are plotted in fig.3 for various values , for the case without ( filled circles ) and with ( open circles ) x - ray thresholds , respectively .",
    "the results are fully consistent with those of the rank correlation test .",
    "another effect to be noted is that the resulting average of the obtained sample is consistent with the intrinsic ( @xmath93 ) only for small ( @xmath94 ) , and it increases towards higher with a typical difference of @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
    "the fitted slopes are found to be independent of the specified value of and insensitive to the x - ray observational thresholds as well as to sample completeness .",
    "however , they depend slightly on the dispersion ( within plausible limits on ) in a manner that , at large , the slope increases with for a given .",
    "we plot in fig.3 the results for samples assuming @xmath97 ( triangles ) and @xmath98 ( squares ) , respectively , ignoring the effect of x - ray thresholds .",
    "the shaded areas in the figure indicate the @xmath99 confidence region of @xmath91 obtained in previous studies ( @xmath100 , wilkes  1994 , yuan  1998 ; @xmath101 , green  1995 ) .",
    "it shows that the observed slopes can be reproduced within a relatively large region in the parameter space of and .",
    "furthermore , the slopes also depend only marginally on the low - luminosity cutoff @xmath102 chosen for , which is somewhat uncertain .    in fig.4",
    "we show the simulated and values for @xmath85 . for `",
    "non - detections ' lower limits on are shown as crosses .",
    "this distribution , as well as that for samples at fixed redshift ( fig.2 ) , differs from what is expected for a linear @xmath103relation , showing asymmetric structures with respect to a regression line .    to test the correctness of the simulation procedure each sample was subjected to a self - consistency check using the evolution weighted schmidt s ( 1968 ) @xmath104 , as in chanan ( 1983 ) .",
    "the simulated samples represented the envisaged luminosity function evolution as the resulting @xmath105 were distributed randomly around 0.5 within the @xmath106 uncertainties .",
    "we also performed similar analyses starting from instead of . after having determined @xmath43 , was drawn from the lf for , @xmath107 , which is approximated by the observed xlf .",
    "we used the broken power law lf as given in boyle ( 1994 ) , with a faint - end slope @xmath46 , a bright - end slope @xmath108 , and evolution rate @xmath109 for @xmath53 .",
    "then , a corresponding was obtained from eq.[eq : a ] for the given .",
    "the observed luminosities were drawn in the same way as above .",
    "similar results were found , i.e.  an apparent correlation towards high .",
    "this is expected because of the striking similarity between the olf and xlf ( boyle 1994 ) .",
    "we conclude that an apparent correlation can emerge even for a population with an intrinsically constant in the presence of large dispersions in the sed and for @xmath110 .",
    "the degree of correlation depends on the -parameter .",
    "similar results hold for x - ray selected quasar samples , as well as for incomplete samples .",
    "the simulation results can be understood in terms of simple intuitive arguments .",
    "we show schematic sketches for the relation in fig.5a and the corresponding relation in fig.5b for a sample at fixed redshift . following sect .",
    "2.1 , the distribution of luminosities in the optical and x - ray regime is determined by the mean .",
    "a constant @xmath93 is assumed ( thick lines in fig.5a and b ) , as well as constant luminosity dispersions and ( indicated for an object at q ) . the expected luminosities and are distributed along the line of constant according to their distribution function @xmath111 , with a cutoff at the bright end of and for a sample with finite size .",
    "we consider the distribution of objects deviating from and due to luminosity scatter in the and planes .",
    "the 90% probability region for an object is confined within the two thin lines parallel to the mean .",
    "we consider two extreme cases : @xmath112(@xmath96 ) and @xmath113(@xmath94 ) . for @xmath112 ,",
    "the luminosity scatter is predominant in the optical luminosity , i.e.  along the optical axis .",
    "the distribution of objects in the plane forms a confined region below the horizontal dashed line ab , which corresponds to the line ab with slope 0.384 in fig.5b .",
    "an apparent correlation appears between and for such distributions , despite the intrinsically uncorrelated relation .",
    "this effect explains the simulated distribution in fig.2 . on the other hand , in the case of @xmath113 ,",
    "objects are distributed in a region confined by line cd ( dashed - dotted ) and no correlation is expected from the high - end .",
    "the actual degree of correlation increases with relative to , which explains the dependence correlation on , as seen in figs.1 and 3 .",
    "moreover , flux limits in x - rays ( indicated by the line gh ) , tend to enhance the apparent correlation , as can be seen from fig.5b and fig.2 . for an optically selected sample",
    ", the cutoff due to the optical flux limit ( indicated by ef ) systematically excludes objects with smaller values , which qualitatively explains the resulting increase of average for large .",
    "we note that , in order to get a sharply confined distribution at the high luminosity cutoffs , a steep luminosity function for ( ) is required towards the high luminosity end .",
    "our simulations show that the observed optical and x - ray quasar luminosity functions satisfy this condition .",
    "using simulations basically similar to ours and a much steeper luminosity function ( gaussian distribution ) , chanan ( 1983 ) found the existence of a correlation in his cases b and c , but not in case a , corresponding to @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 in our analysis .",
    "these values are close to the critical point @xmath115 , and the results of chanan are thus not a consequence of the reversal of dependent and independent variables in the regression analysis .",
    "furthermore , the use of the -parameter in our work , i.e.the relative strength of and , is physically more meaningful than the assumption that the luminosity of one wave band directly determines that in the other band ( as in chanan 1983 ) .",
    "the case of @xmath96 leads to a more pronounced high - luminosity cutoff for compared to ( see also fig.2 ) .",
    "this effect is also seen in observational data ( brinkmann  1997 ) .",
    "it can also be seen in fig.5a that , when performing a linear regression analysis for the relation , different distributions of the data near the highest luminosities can result in different slopes for different .",
    "thus , a simple linear regression analysis method is not always adequate to quantify a luminosity correlation , especially for data with large inherent scatter .",
    "our results show that an apparent dependence of on can emerge from data for a quasar sample with no intrinsic dependence .",
    "thus , the explanation of the observed @xmath103correlation as a physical relation in quasars , as taken for granted in previous work , must be questioned .",
    "although the current study does not allow to unambiguously distinguish between an _ intrinsic _ or an _ apparent _ dependence of on , we may reach some conclusions by simple considerations .",
    "if our model is a good description of the quasar luminosity correlation and dispersion , we expect the existence of an apparent correlation to some extent , unless in cases of rather small ( @xmath117 ) , i.e.  when the dispersion in is at least 3 times less than that in , which seems unlikely considering the diversity of the big - blue - bump component in quasar energy spectra .",
    "in fact , the aforementioned characteristics of a much tighter high - luminosity cutoff for than for seems to exist in most quasar samples of considerable size .",
    "thus , an intrinsic dependence , if it does exist , must be weaker than it appears from the data .    to quantify these effects",
    ", we carried out similar simulations incorporating an intrinsic luminosity dependent as in eq.[eq : c ] , @xmath118 , and compare the obtained slopes @xmath91 of the relation with the observed values .",
    "for each grid point in the @xmath119parameter space , we repeated the simulations for 200 trials and counted the number @xmath120 of trials for which @xmath91 fell into a region around the observed value @xmath121 , at a confidence level @xmath122 .",
    "the overall confidence level of reproducing the observed slope is thus @xmath123 , if systematic uncertainties , such as sample incompleteness etc . , are ignored .",
    "for @xmath100 ( wilkes  1994 , yuan  1998 ) , fig.6 shows the contours of the 68% ( thick lines ) and 90% ( thin lines ) confidence regions of the joint @xmath119 distribution for = 0.15 ( dotted ) , 0.18 ( solid ) , and 0.20 ( dashed ) , respectively .",
    "the results show that only a weak dependence ( @xmath124 ) is needed for @xmath125 , when the dispersion in is comparable to or larger than that in ; and almost no intrinsic dependence is needed for larger @xmath126 .",
    "it also shows that the most probable ( 68% ) region appears at high ( @xmath127 ) , low @xmath128 values .",
    "more qualitative evidence comes from some features of the observed relation .",
    "recent studies of large quasar samples ( avni  1995 , brinkmann  1997 , yuan  1998 ) have shown that the observed correlation shows a more complex behavior , with only weak or even vanishing correlation at low optical luminosities .",
    "we find that such features are expected , as the apparent correlation for @xmath84 arises mainly from objects with high optical luminosities .",
    "this property has been verified by estimating the average in different bins for the simulated data .",
    "this can be seen in fig.4 , where we plot the average ( thick bars ) for five bins , which were obtained by incorporating upper limits for the ` non detections ' using the maximum likelihood method developed by avni  ( 1980 ) .",
    "a comparison of the observed olf and xlf and their evolution may also give , in principle , constraints on the intrinsic  , or relation ( eqs.[eq : b ] and [ eq : c ] ) .",
    "for a power law luminosity function for @xmath129 with index @xmath130 , and luminosity evolution @xmath131 , it can be shown ( see also kriss & canizares 1985 ) that the corresponding lf for @xmath132 is also a power law ( index @xmath133 ) with evolution @xmath134 and @xmath135 for a gaussian approximation of the luminosity dispersion , the luminosity functions @xmath45 , @xmath136 have the same forms and evolution as the observed luminosity functions @xmath137 , @xmath138 . thus , @xmath23 and @xmath139 can be estimated from the observed @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath130 and @xmath133 .    the optical evolution index is found to be @xmath142 ( boyle 1994 ) . however , the x - ray evolution index is somewhat uncertain  ranging from @xmath143 ( della ceca  1992 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 emss data only ) , @xmath146 ( jones  1997 ) and @xmath147 ( boyle  1994 ) to @xmath148 ( franceschini  1994 ) .",
    "the latter three values were obtained by incorporating rosat data , and they are consistent with @xmath149 and @xmath150 within their 2 @xmath151 errors , i.e.  no intrinsic dependence of on is needed . even if we take the smallest value of @xmath152 of jones  ( 1997 ) , we have @xmath153 and @xmath154 , implying only a marginal dependence , weaker than the previous claims of @xmath155 .",
    "the bright - end slopes of the xlf ( @xmath156 ) and of the olf ( @xmath157 , boyle 1994 ) are consistent with each other within their 2@xmath151 errors , and thus also consistent with @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "we conclude that a constant independent of is not ruled out by a comparison of the observed luminosity functions in the optical and the x - ray band .",
    "we have performed monte carlo simulations to study the luminosity correlation between the optical and x - ray bands for quasars . we have used a generalized model in which the luminosities in the two wave bands are represented in terms of the respective expected luminosities with dispersions ( @xmath158 , @xmath159 ) .",
    "we have shown that the increase of with @xmath0 ( equivalent to @xmath160 with @xmath161 ) , as found in observational data , can emerge in a sample with an intrinsic luminosity independent ( or @xmath7 ) , provided that the dispersion of the optical luminosities deviating from the average sed are similar to or larger than that of the x - ray luminosities .",
    "our simulations verified the results of chanan ( 1983 ) , which were achieved for special assumption about the luminosity functions .",
    "we suggest that the _ observed _ @xmath0 correlation is , at least to a large extent , apparent and not necessarily an intrinsic property of the quasar population .",
    "our model is more general than previous considerations . for @xmath162",
    "( implying @xmath163 and @xmath164 ) the model reduces to the commonly used description , in which is the primary luminosity and the dispersion in the sed is attributed to that in the x - ray luminosity .",
    "the same holds for @xmath165 , but with interchanged roles of and .",
    "we argue that the effect of the relative strength of the individual luminosity dispersions in the two bands should be taken into account in analyses of quasar luminosity correlations .",
    "since the arguments are valid for any other two wave bands , we expect this effect to play a role in luminosity correlations between radio , infrared , optical , and x - ray wave bands as well .",
    "the determination of the -parameter , and thus of the luminosity scatter in the individual wave bands , is important to understand the broad band emission of quasars .",
    "we finally note that a similar effect as presented for the @xmath166 correlation might also apply for the well - known baldwin effect , i.e.  the inverse correlation of optical emission line equivalent width with optical luminosity ( baldwin 1977 ) . since the equivalent width basically can be regarded as the ratio of two luminosities ( emission line and underlying continuum ) , the structure of the problem is similar to the one presented in this paper .",
    "this is particularly interesting , because there still is no accepted physical explanation for the baldwin effect .",

    "<S> the determining factor for this behavior turns out to be the relative strength of the dispersions of the luminosities , i.e.  their deviations from the mean spectral energy distribution at the optical and x - ray bands , such that a dispersion larger for the optical luminosity than for the x - ray luminosity tends to result in an apparent correlation . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the observed @xmath0 correlation can be attributed , at least to some extent , to such an effect , and is thus not an underlying physical property . </S>",
    "<S> the consequences of taking into account the luminosity dispersions in an analysis of the observed luminosity correlations is briefly discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we note that similar considerations might also apply for the baldwin effect . </S>"
