    "our key finding is that the spatial distribution of the active sites ( where the attachment of motor proteins occurs ) is as important as the form of the potential ( give an example in support of this claim , but here we provide a comprehensive proof ) .",
    "we can theoretically anticipate the behaviour ( for example , the bulk transport direction ) of motor proteins and their cargoes .",

    "we do not require additional hypotheses imposed in earlier biophysical papers such that correlation of the asymmetry of the potential with the intended direction of transport or localization of the detachment areas around the minima of the potential .",
    "our theory is also able to detect the transport direction in the case when there are two or more attachment sites within each period or their spatial distribution becomes more homogeneous .",
    "another popular model for molecular motors is the classical or deterministic flashing ratchet . in the biomotor context , it may be interpreted assuming that during some period of time all the particles are bound to motor proteins , and are therefore potential - sensitive . then , suddenly , all the tiny `` parcels '' simultaneously lose their carriers and start to diffuse freely . after a certain time interval ,",
    "the motors synchronously reattach to their cargoes , and the whole process repeats on and on .",
    "thus , conformation is completely disregarded .",
    "the direction of transport is dictated by the location of the minima of the asymmetric periodic chemical potential with respect to the centres of the potential wells @xcite .",
    "the deterministic flashing ratchet has promising applications in many areas of science .",
    "however , in connection with motor proteins , the random ratchet seems to be more pliable and realistic .",
    "our analysis shows that predictions of the random and deterministic flashing ratchets may significantly differ .",
    "for instance , if the region of attachment activity is unique ( up to spatial periodicity ) , and the minimum of the chemical potential is located between that active zone and the centre of the potential well , then the bulk transport directions anticipated by the two models are exactly the opposite of one another . on the other hand ,",
    "when the distribution of attachment sites is symmetric ( no matter how many active areas are present in each well ) , the forecasts of the models essentially coincide .",
    "these observations give a new insight for experimental verification and validation of the flashing ratchets .",
    "we now summarize the major biological implications of the paper .",
    "our theoretical analysis has highlighted the main factors that govern the operation of biomotors : chemical potential , architecture of the involved proteins , structural changes in the system , including attachment / detachment of motor proteins , and diffusion .",
    "we have illustrated that the interplay between these factors is very complex , and their subtle alterations may change behaviour of the system , in particular , the bulk transport direction .",
    "our key finding is that the spatial distribution of the active sites ( where the attachment of motor proteins occurs ) is as important as the form of the potential .",
    "previous rigorous studies revolved around the primacy of asymmetry of the chemical potential , whereas the influence of distribution of attachment / detachment sites was considered as a subordinate and tributary factor or disregarded at all .",
    "we have also made it possible to predict the collective behaviour of motor proteins and their cargoes in vivo and in vitro .",
    "we have shed more light on the understanding of the mechanism of motor proteins , and have showed that the value of qualitative mathematical analysis can not be underrated prior to designing biomotor - powered hybrid devices and artificial biomotors .",
