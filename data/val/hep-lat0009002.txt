    "the eigenvalues of the dirac operator are of great interest for the universality of important features of qcd and qed . on the one hand ,",
    "the accumulation of small eigenvalues is , via the banks - casher formula  @xcite , related to the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "the fluctuation properties of the eigenvalues in the bulk of the spectrum can be described by random matrix theory ( rmt ) , see ref .",
    "for example , the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution @xmath0 , i.e. , the distribution of spacings @xmath1 between adjacent eigenvalues on the unfolded scale , agrees with the wigner surmise of rmt .",
    "according to the bohigas - giannoni - schmit conjecture  @xcite , quantum systems whose classical counterparts are chaotic  @xcite have a nearest - neighbor spacing distribution given by rmt whereas systems whose classical counterparts are integrable obey a poisson distribution , @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the specific form of @xmath0 is often taken as a criterion for the presence or absence of `` quantum chaos '' .    in rmt",
    ", one has to distinguish several universality classes which are determined by the symmetries of the system . for the case of the qcd dirac operator ,",
    "this classification was done in ref .",
    "@xcite . depending on the number of colors and the representation of the quarks ,",
    "the dirac operator is described by one of the three chiral ensembles of rmt .",
    "as far as the fluctuation properties in the bulk of the spectrum are concerned , the predictions of the chiral ensembles are identical to those of the ordinary ensembles  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dirac matrix was studied for color - su(2 ) using both staggered and wilson fermions which correspond to the chiral symplectic ( chse ) and orthogonal ( choe ) ensemble , respectively .",
    "here  @xcite , we study su(3 ) with staggered fermions which corresponds to the chiral unitary ensemble ( chue ) .",
    "the rmt result for the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution can be expressed in terms of so - called prolate spheroidal functions , see ref .",
    "@xcite . a very good approximation to @xmath0",
    "is provided by the wigner surmise for the unitary ensemble , @xmath3    we generated gauge field configurations using the standard wilson plaquette action for su(3 ) with and without dynamical fermions in the kogut - susskind prescription .",
    "we have worked on a @xmath4 lattice with various values of the inverse gauge coupling @xmath5 both in the confinement and deconfinement phase .",
    "we typically produced 10 independent equilibrium configurations for each @xmath6 .",
    "the dirac operator , @xmath7 , is anti - hermitian so that the eigenvalues @xmath8 of @xmath9 are real .",
    "because of @xmath10 the nonzero @xmath8 occur in pairs of opposite sign .",
    "all spectra were checked against the analytical sum rules @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where v is the lattice volume . to construct the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution from the eigenvalues ,",
    "one first has to `` unfold '' the spectra  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fintemp ] compares @xmath0 of full qcd with @xmath13 flavors and quark mass @xmath14 to the rmt result . in the confinement",
    "@xmath15 as well as in the deconfinement @xmath16 phase we observe agreement with rmt up to very high @xmath6 ( not shown ) . the observation that @xmath0 is not influenced by the presence of dynamical quarks is expected from the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , which apply to the case of massless quarks .",
    "our results , and those of ref .",
    "@xcite , indicate that massive dynamical quarks do not affect @xmath0 either .",
    "we have also investigated the staggered dirac spectrum of 4d u(1 ) gauge theory which corresponds to the chue of rmt . at @xmath17 u(1 )",
    "gauge theory undergoes a phase transition between a confinement phase with mass gap and monopole excitations for @xmath18 and the coulomb phase which exhibits a massless photon for @xmath19  @xcite . as for su(2 ) and su(3 ) gauge groups , we expect the confined phase to be described by rmt , whereas free fermions yield the poisson distribution . the question arose whether the coulomb phase would be described by rmt or by the poisson distribution  @xcite .",
    "the nearest - neighbor spacing distributions for an @xmath20 lattice at @xmath21 ( confined phase ) and at @xmath22 ( coulomb phase ) , averaged over 20 independent configurations , are depicted in fig .",
    "both are well described by the chue of rmt .",
    "no signs for a transition to poisson regularity are found .",
    "the deconfinement phase transition does not seem to coincide with a transition in the spacing distribution .",
    "for very large values of @xmath6 far into the deconfinement region , the eigenvalues start to approach the degenerate eigenvalues of the free theory , given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the lattice constant , @xmath25 is the number of lattice sites in the @xmath26-direction , and @xmath27 . in this case",
    ", the spacing distribution is neither wigner nor poisson .",
    "it is possible to lift the degeneracies of the free eigenvalues using an asymmetric lattice where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , etc .",
    "are relative primes and , for large lattices , the distribution is then poisson , @xmath2 , see fig .",
    "we have continued our investigations with a study of the distribution of the small eigenvalues in the whole phase diagram .",
    "the banks - casher formula @xcite relates the dirac eigenvalue density @xmath30 at @xmath31 to the chiral condensate , @xmath32 . the microscopic spectral density , @xmath33 should be given by the appropriate prediction of rmt  @xcite , which also generates the leutwyler - smilga sum rules  @xcite .",
    "we present results in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for su(3 ) theory and the staggered dirac operator on a @xmath34 lattice from 5000 configurations for @xmath35 and 3000 configurations for @xmath36 and @xmath37 around the critical temperature @xmath38 . in the confinement phase , both the microscopic spectral density @xmath39 and",
    "the distribution @xmath40 of the smallest eigenvalue agree with the rmt predictions of the chue for topological charge @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "our analog presentation for u(1 ) theory is from 10000 configurations on a @xmath34 lattice around the critical coupling . in the left plot of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] a comparison with rmt for the microscopic spectral density @xmath42 yields again quite satisfactory agreement in the confinement .",
    "the analytical rmt result for the ( quenched ) chue and @xmath43 is given by @xcite @xmath44/2 $ ] , where @xmath45 denotes the bessel function .",
    "the chiral condensate @xmath46 can be obtained by extrapolating the histogram for @xmath30 to @xmath31 and using the banks - casher relation  @xcite .",
    "the right plot in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] exhibits the distribution @xmath47 of the smallest eigenvalue , being in the chirally broken phase in accordance with the prediction of the ( quenched ) chue of rmt for topological charge @xmath43 , @xmath48 .",
    "the quasi - zero modes which are responsible for the chiral condensate @xmath49 build up when we cross from the deconfinement into the confined phase",
    ". figures  [ fig4 ] and  [ fig5 ] demonstrate that both @xmath30 and @xmath50 plotted with varying @xmath6 on identical scales , respectively , can serve as an indicator for the phase transition .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we turn to a discussion of the spectrum in the quark - gluon plasma and coulomb phase . from rmt a functional form of @xmath51",
    "is expected at the onset of the eigenvalue density  @xcite .",
    "a fit to the data in the regime up to @xmath52 yields @xmath53 for the non - abelian and @xmath54 for the abelian theory , in agreement with recent studies  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that both theories correspond to universality class @xmath55 . for this class",
    "a microscopic level density involving the airy function can be deduced from rmt  @xcite .",
    "a rescaling of our data from the @xmath34 lattice to this functional form is not satisfactory for both theories  @xcite",
    ". the reason might be ( i ) that the lowest eigenvalue is still influenced by quasi - zero modes from the confinement and ( ii ) that already the first eigenvalues lie above an analogue of the thouless energy . with increasing lattice size these effects should decrease .",
    "further , we checked that the high - end of the spectrum behaves similar to the low - end and thus deviates from the results of the ordinary ue of rmt  @xcite .",
    "again the question arises whether larger lattices possess spectral edges closer to the microscopic semi - circle universality .",
    "the aim of this contribution was to work out two different types of universalities inherent in quantum field theories with a covariant derivative and their interpretation in terms of rmt .",
    "the first type concerns the bulk of the spectrum of the dirac operator . the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution @xmath0 agrees with the rmt result in both the confinement and the deconfinement phase of pure gauge theory and of full qcd , except for extremely large values of @xmath6 where the eigenvalues are known analytically .",
    "the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution of 4d u(1 ) quenched lattice gauge theory is described by the chue of rmt in both the confinement and the coulomb phase . even in the deconfinement phase ,",
    "gauge fields retain a considerable degree of randomness , which apparently gives rise to quantum chaos in these theories .    the second type of universality concerns the low - lying spectra of the dirac operators of both qcd and qed . in all cases considered",
    ", one finds that in the phase in which chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken the distribution @xmath47 and the microscopic spectral density @xmath39 are described by chiral rmt .",
    "when chiral symmetry is restored one has to rely on ordinary rmt with the related space - time symmetries , but one finds for our lattice size only universal behavior of the macroscopic density @xmath30 .",
