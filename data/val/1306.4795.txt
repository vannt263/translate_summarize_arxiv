    "elastic manifolds in random media , especially the problem of a directed line ( dl ) or directed polymer in a random potential , are one of the most important model systems in the statistical physics of disordered systems @xcite .",
    "dls in random media are related to important non - equilibrium statistical physics problems such as stochastic growth , in particular the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation @xcite , burgers turbulence , or the asymmetric simple exclusion model ( asep ) @xcite . furthermore , there are many and important applications of dls in random media such as kinetic roughening @xcite , pinning of flux lines in type - ii superconductors @xcite , domain walls in random magnets , or wetting fronts @xcite",
    ".    directed lines have a preferred direction and no overhangs with respect to this direction .",
    "the energy of dls such as flux lines , domain walls , wetting fronts is proportional to their length ; therefore , the elastic properties of directed lines are governed by their line tension , which favors the straight configuration of shortest length .",
    "both thermal fluctuations and a short - range random potential ( point disorder ) tend to roughen the dl against the line tension . as a result of the competition between thermal fluctuations and disorder , dls in a random media in @xmath1 dimensions",
    "exhibit a disorder - driven localization transition @xcite for dimensions @xmath2 , i.e. , above a critical dimension @xmath3 .",
    "these transitions have been studied numerically for dimensions up to @xmath4 @xcite . at low temperatures ,",
    "the dl is in a disorder dominated phase and localizes into a path optimizing the random potential energy and the tension energy . within this disorder dominated phase , the dl roughens",
    ", there are macroscopic energy fluctuations and a finite pair overlap between replicas @xcite ( introduced below ) . at high temperatures ,",
    "the disorder is an irrelevant perturbation , and the dl exhibits essentially thermal fluctuations against the line tension .",
    "it has been suggested that the critical temperature for the localization transition of a dl in a random medium and the binding of two dls by a short - range attractive potential coincide @xcite .",
    "dls in a random medium map onto the dynamic kpz equation for nonlinear stochastic surface growth with the restricted free energy of dls in 1+d dimensions satisfying the kpz equation of a @xmath5-dimensional dynamic interface .",
    "the localization transition of dls with increasing disorder corresponds to a roughening transition of the kpz interface with increasing nonlinearity . in the context of the kpz equation , it is a long - standing open question ( recently discussed for example in ref .",
    "@xcite ) whether there exists an upper critical dimension , where the critical behavior at the localization transition is modified . therefore ,",
    "the critical behavior of lines in random media can eventually also shed light onto the critical properties of the kpz equation .",
    "in the present paper , we study the localization transition of _ stiff _ directed lines ( sdls ) .",
    "we define sdls as directed lines with preferred orientation and no overhangs with respect to this direction , but with a different elastic energy as compared to dls : sdls are governed by bending energy , which penalizes curvature , rather than line tension , which penalizes stretching of the line .",
    "this gives rise to configurations which are locally curvature - free , i.e. , straight but straight segments can assume any orientation even if this increases the total length of the line .",
    "we investigate the disorder - induced localization transition of sdls for a short - range random potential and the scaling properties of conformations in the disordered phase . a typical optimal sdl configuration in the presence of an additional short - range random potential at zero temperature is shown in fig .  [ fig : t0](a ) , in comparison to a typical optimal dl configurations in fig .  [ fig : t0](b ) .",
    "there are a number of applications for sdls in random media .",
    "sdls describe semiflexible polymers smaller than their persistence length , such that the assumption of a directed line is not violated .",
    "our results apply to semiflexible polymers such as dna or cytoskeletal filaments like f - actin in a random environment as it could be realized , for example , by a porous medium @xcite .",
    "moreover , sdls are closely connected to surface growth models for molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) @xcite . in the presence of surface diffusion",
    ", mbe can be described by a herring - mullins linear diffusion equation@xcite , which is equivalent to the overdamped equation of motion of a sdl . as a result ,",
    "sdls exhibit the same super - roughness as mbe interfaces .",
    "more generally , the zero temperature problem of a sdl in disorder can be formulated as a generic optimization problem for paths in an array of randomly distributed favorable `` pinning '' sites ( as indicated by points in fig .   [ fig : t0 ] ) , which minimize their bending energy at the same time as maximizing the number of visited favorable pinning sites .",
    "there is an important relation between the statistical physics of dls and sdls , which stems from the return probabilities of _ pairs _ of lines : the contact probability @xmath6 of two thermally fluctuating dls in 1 + 3d dimensions , i.e. , the probability of two dls with common starting point to meet again after length @xmath7 , decays with the same power law @xmath8 as the contact probability of sdls in 1+d dimensions @xcite",
    ". we will provide strong numerical evidence for @xmath9 that this relation between dls in 1 + 3d dimensions and sdls in 1+d dimensions not only holds for purely thermal fluctuations but also in the presence of a random medium with a short - range disorder potential .",
    "this relation then allows to address the localization transition of dls from a different perspective@xcite .",
    "because the proposed relation between dls and sdls is based on return probabilities of _ pairs _ of replicas our results also suggest that the critical properties of dls in a random potential and , thus , the critical properties of the kpz equation are determined by the corresponding two replica problem .",
    "in particular , the relation between dls and sdls implies that the critical dimension for the localization of sdls is @xmath10 rather than @xmath3 for dls .",
    "therefore , sdls exhibit a localization transition already in @xmath11 dimensions , which is easily amenable to numerical transfer matrix studies , whereas it requires numerical studies in @xmath12 dimensions to investigate the localization transition of dls .",
    "therefore , we can verify several concepts that have been proposed or found for the localization transition of dls , e.g. , the pair overlap as order parameter or the multifractality of the localization transition , by simulations of sdls in @xmath11 dimensions .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the model for stiff directed lines ( sdls ) and comment on its relation to directed lines ( dls ) . the paper",
    "is then divided into two parts , analytical considerations and numerical findings .",
    "first , we apply scaling analysis to determine the lower critical dimension for the localization transition as well as estimates for the roughness in the localized phase",
    ". then we present analytical treatments using variation in replica space and functional renormalization group and outline difficulties associated with both techniques . at last ,",
    "we introduce a numerical transfer matrix algorithm for a sdl in a random medium and present numerical results , which validate the existence of a disorder - driven phase transition into a localized , roughened phase at low temperatures .",
    "we present numerical results for the roughness , the disorder - induced persistence length , derrida - flyvbjerg singularities , and the free energy distribution .",
    "furthermore , we investigate numerically the pair overlap order parameter and multifractal properties of the transition .",
    "a short account of some of these results has already appeared as a rapid communication @xcite .",
    "( realizations of the quenched disorder are not identical in a and b).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the configuration of a general directed line , i.e. , one without overhangs or loops and without inextensibility constraint , can be parametrized by @xmath13 @xmath14 with a @xmath5-dimensional displacement @xmath15 normal to its preferred orientation . in the following , we call the fixed projected length @xmath7 the length of the line .",
    "the contour length of the line is given by @xmath16 ( to leading order in @xmath17 ) ; it is not fixed and always larger than the length @xmath7 .",
    "each configuration of a sdl is associated with an energy @xmath18 ,   \\label{eq : ham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term is the bending energy ( to leading order in @xmath17 ) .",
    "the second term is the disorder energy with a gaussian distributed quenched random potential @xmath19 with zero mean @xmath20 and short - range correlations @xmath21 @xmath22 denotes the quenched disorder average over realizations of @xmath23 , whereas @xmath24 denotes thermal averaging .",
    "the sdl model is often used as a weak - bending approximation to the so - called worm - like chain or kratky - porod model @xcite @xmath25\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the basic model for inextensible semiflexible polymers , such as dna or cytoskeletal filaments like f - actin .",
    "the chain is parametrized in arc length , leading to a local inextensibility constraint @xmath26 , which is hard to account for , both numerically and analytically @xcite . for thermally",
    "fluctuating semiflexible polymers , the approximation only applies to a weakly bent semiflexible polymer on length scales _ below _ the so - called persistence length , which is @xcite @xmath27 in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "we use here and throughout the following energy units with @xmath28 . above the persistence length , a semiflexible",
    "polymer loses orientation correlations and starts to develop overhangs .",
    "also in a quenched random potential the sdl model describes semiflexible polymers in heterogeneous media , only as long as tangent fluctuations are small such that overhangs can be neglected , which is the case below a _ disorder - induced _ persistence length , which we will derive below .",
    "we consider the sdl model also in the thermodynamic limit beyond this persistence length , because we find evidence for a relation to the important problem of dls in a random medium in _ lower _ dimensions .",
    "this relation is based on replica pair interactions and shows that pair interactions also determine the nature of the dl localization transition .",
    "moreover , this relation can make the dl transition in high dimensions computationally accessible .",
    "we will now outline the idea behind this relation .",
    "( introduced below in eq .  ( [ eq : scalrel ] ) ) and for the free energy distribution @xmath29 are presented in sections [ sec : rough ] and [ sec : distrib ] .",
    "the shaded area marks the range of the short - ranged ( binding ) potential .",
    "the effective binding interaction becomes apparent in the replica formalism ( section [ sec : replica ] ) ; the importance of two - replica interactions for sdls is one essential result of this work , see sections [ tct2 ] and [ sec : overlap].,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the difference between sdls and dls @xcite is the _ second _ derivative in the first bending energy term in eq.([eq : ham ] ) for sdls , which differs from the tension or stretching energy @xmath30 of dls with line tension @xmath31 .",
    "this results in different types of energetically favorable configurations ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : t0 ] ) : large perpendicular displacements @xmath17 of sdls as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t0](a ) are not unfavorable as long as their `` direction '' does not change , i.e. , as long as their are locally straight and , therefore , do not cost bending energy .",
    "such configurations increase , however , the length of the line and are suppressed for dls by the tension or stretching energy .",
    "the statistics of displacements @xmath17 is characterized by the _",
    "roughness exponent _",
    "@xmath32 , which is defined by @xmath33 .",
    "the thermal roughness is @xmath34 for dls and @xmath35 for sdls : equating the thermal energy @xmath36 with the respective elastic energies gives @xmath37 for dls and @xmath38 for sdls . here and in the following we use subscripts @xmath31 ( tension ) and @xmath39 ( bending stiffness ) to distinguish between the two systems .",
    "although typical configurations are quite different , a sdl subject to a short - ranged ( around @xmath40 ) attractive potential @xmath41 can be mapped onto a dl in high dimensions @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "this equivalence is based on the probability that a free line of length @xmath7 starting at ( @xmath43 ) `` returns '' to the origin , i.e. , ends at @xmath44 .",
    "this return probability is characterized by a _ return exponent _ @xmath45 : @xmath46 .",
    "the same return exponent characterizes the contact probability @xmath47 , i.e. , the probability of two lines with common starting point to meet again after length @xmath7 , as follows from considering the relative coordinate . for dls , which are essentially random walks in @xmath5 transverse dimensions ,",
    "the return exponent is @xmath48 @xcite , whereas it is @xmath49 for a sdl ( after integrating over all orientations of the end ) @xcite ; they are related to the roughness exponents by @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "the return exponent @xmath45 governs the critical properties of the binding transition to a short - range attractive potential or , equivalently , of the binding transition of two lines interacting by such a potential @xcite .",
    "this follows , for example , directly from a necklace model treatment @xcite .",
    "the relation @xmath51 implies that the binding transition of two dls in @xmath52 dimensions maps onto to the binding transition of two sdls in @xmath5 dimensions .    in the replica formulation of line localization problems such as ( [ eq : ham ] ) , the random potential gives rise to a short - range attractive pair interaction ( see below ) .",
    "therefore , pairwise interactions of dls play a prominent role also for the physics of a single dl in a random potential . furthermore",
    ", the critical temperature @xmath53 for a dl in a random potential is believed to be identical to the critical temperature @xmath54 for a system with two replicas @xcite . in section [ tct2 ]",
    ", we will show numerically that also for sdls in a random medium @xmath55 holds .",
    "the important role of pairwise interactions suggests that not only the binding transition of two dls in @xmath52 dimensions maps onto to the binding transition of two sdls in @xmath5 dimensions but that the same dimensional relation holds for the localization transitions of dls and sdls in a short - range random potential .",
    "one aim of this work is to support this conjecture by providing strong numerical evidence that the @xmath56 analogy between dls and sdls in a random potential holds for the _ entire _ free energy distributions for dls in 1 + 3 and sdls in 1 + 1 dimensions . because this analogy is rooted in the binding transition of replica pairs",
    ", we can conclude that critical properties of the localization transition are determined by pair interactions in the replicated hamiltonian , which has been previously suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been proposed that pair interactions can be used to formulate an order parameter of the disorder - driven localization transition of dls in terms of the overlap @xmath57 @xcite , i.e. , the average number of sites per length , that two lines in the same realization of the disorder have in common .",
    "localization by disorder gives rise to a finite value of the pair overlap @xmath58 .",
    "this coincides with the binding energy per length that characterizes binding of two polymers by a pair potential .",
    "we will also show that the pair overlap indeed provides a suitable order parameter for the localization transition of sdls in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "a schematic summary of the relation of dls and sdls together ( together with some relevant numeric results ) is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : result2 ] .",
    "under renormalization.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]      we start with a scaling analysis by a flory - type argument . for displacements @xmath59 the bending energy in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) scales as @xmath60 , which also leads to @xmath61 and the thermal roughness exponent @xmath35 .",
    "the disorder energy in eq .   ( [ eq : ham ] ) scales as @xmath62 , as can be seen from eq . .",
    "using the unperturbed thermal roughness in the disorder energy we get @xmath63 , from which we conclude that the disorder is relevant below a _ lower critical dimension _ @xmath64",
    "with @xmath65 above this critical dimension for @xmath0 and , thus , in all physically accessible integer dimensions , the sdl should exhibit a transition from a thermal phase for low @xmath66 to a disorder dominated phase above a critical value @xmath67 of the disorder ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : renorm ] ) .",
    "of course the same distinction could be made in terms of the temperature with a high temperature phase for @xmath68 and a disorder dominated low temperature phase for @xmath69 . in the disorder dominated phase ,",
    "the sdl becomes localized or `` pinned '' into a configuration favored by the random potential and assumes a roughened configuration , see fig .",
    "[ fig : t0 ] .",
    "we remember that the lower critical dimension for dls is @xmath70 , which is in accordance with the relation between dls in 1 + 3d dimensions and sdls in 1+d dimensions proposed in the previous section .",
    "we also point out that for both types of lines the return exponent @xmath45 assumes the universal value @xmath71 at the critical dimension because of @xmath72 and @xmath73 @xcite .    with @xmath74 the localization transition of sdls can be studied numerically in 1 + 1 ( or higher ) integer dimensions , whereas for dls with @xmath70 , the localization transition is only accessible in simulations in 1 + 3 ( or higher ) integer dimensions .",
    "our numerical study of the line localization transition presented below focuses on sdls in 1 + 1 dimensions , which are computationally better accessible using transfer matrix techniques as compared to a 1 + 3 dimensional system of dls .",
    "this allows us to verify important concepts for the localization transition such as the overlap order parameter in section [ sec : overlap ] , which have not been accessible for dls in 1 + 3 dimensions up to now .      balancing the flory estimates , @xmath75 , gives a roughness estimate @xmath76 .",
    "when disorder is relevant , this leads to @xmath77 this result is only applicable below the critical dimension @xmath78 , where @xmath79 . above the critical dimension , the flory - result would give @xmath80 , which contradicts our expectation that the sdl roughens as it adjusts to the random potential .",
    "furthermore , the exponent @xmath81 related to the sample to sample free energy fluctuations @xmath82 via @xmath83 would be negative because of the general scaling relation @xmath84 this scaling relation follows from the scaling of the bending energy @xmath85 and the assumption @xmath86 that bending and free energy have the same scale dependence .",
    "note that we do not subscript @xmath81 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scalrel ] ) as we believe that @xmath87 , see section [ sec : numericalresults ] .",
    "an exponent @xmath88 contradicts the existence of large disorder - induced free energy fluctuations in the low - temperature phase @xcite , for which there is also strong numerical evidence@xcite .",
    "we conclude that this kind of argument is not applicable above the critical dimension .",
    "the same problems occur in flory arguments for the dl for @xmath89 , where one finds @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the flory approach underestimates the roughness exponent for all dimensions both for dls and sdls , i.e. , @xmath92 as it features only one length scale on which the line can adjust to the disorder .",
    "therefore the flory results @xmath93 should provide a lower bound for the roughness exponent , i.e. , @xmath94 .",
    "moreover , the thermal roughness @xmath34 for dls and @xmath35 for sdls should provide another lower bound for the disorder - induced roughness , i.e. , @xmath95 because of the existence of disorder - induced free energy fluctuations in the low - temperature phase , i.e. , @xmath96 .",
    "furthermore , we can give an upper bound for the disorder - induced roughness by an argument which relates the line to the zero - dimensional problem of a single particle in a harmonic and a random potential @xcite .",
    "in this argument we divide the line in its middle into two straight and rigid segments separated by the mid - point @xmath97 .",
    "the single ( i.e.  zero - dimensional ) coordinate @xmath98 describes the restricted shape fluctuations of the two - segment line .",
    "the bending energy of these shape fluctuations is @xmath99 , and the disorder energy of the two straight segments is @xmath100 with @xmath101 and @xmath102 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a roughness @xmath103 ( plus logarithmic corrections ) has been obtained for this zero - dimensional problem with the single degree of freedom @xmath98 by an imry - ma argument and a more detailed replica calculation , which implies a roughness exponent @xmath104 for the stiff two - segment line . for the directed line ,",
    "an analogous argument gives @xmath105 . in the framework of a functional renormalization group ( frg ) calculation",
    "both roughness exponents can be written as @xmath106 in a dimensional expansion with the appropriate @xmath107 for dls and @xmath108 for sdls ( see section [ sec : frg ] below ) . using the scaling relations ( [ eq : scalrel ] ) , this results in @xmath109 for two - segment lines ( both for sdls and dls ) , which should be considered an upper bound to the energy fluctuation exponent , because the adaptation of the line to the potential must not lead to larger fluctuations as compared to the trivial case of summing up random numbers @xcite .",
    "therefore , also @xmath110 should provide an upper bound for the roughness exponent , i.e. , @xmath111 .",
    "the upper bound @xmath112 is also found in the frg calculation @xcite .",
    "all in all , we have obtained bounds @xmath113 which apply both for sdls and dls . for sdls , this gives a relatively small window of possible roughness exponents , @xmath114 which , for example , limits @xmath115 for sdls in 1 + 1 dimensions to @xmath116 .",
    "to go beyond scaling arguments we use the replica technique @xcite following the treatment of directed manifolds by mezard and parisi @xcite .",
    "for the sake of convenience we restrict ourselves to @xmath9 throughout this section .",
    "we will comment on how to adapt this to higher dimensions later on .",

    "we studied stiff directed lines ( sdls ) in 1+d dimensions subject to quenched short - range random potential analytically and numerically . using flory - type scaling arguments and a replica calculation",
    "we show that , in dimensions @xmath0 , a localization transition exists from a high temperature phase , where the system is essentially annealed , to a disorder dominated low temperature phase .",
    "the low temperature phase is characterized by large free energy fluctuations with an exponent @xmath96 and a roughness exponent @xmath32 , which slightly exceeds the thermal value @xmath489 for a sdl .",

    "both exponents are related by @xmath491 .",
    "we find a reduction of the persistence length of a stiff directed line by disorder . in the low temperature phase , the persistence length is disorder - induced and temperature - independent .",

    "moreover , the rescaled free energy distributions are _",
    "identical_. both points suggest that the nature of the low - temperature phase is very similar , if not identical .",
    "the multifractal analysis reveals a very similar structure of the statistical weights at the critical temperature for dls in 1 + 3 dimensions and sdls in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "it also allows for a determination of the correlation length exponent @xmath205 , for which we find , again in accordance with the findings for a dl in 1 + 3 dimensions , @xmath376 .",
    "additionally , we find evidence for the relevance of rare events at criticality .",
    "this strongly supports a relation between dls in 1 + 3d and sdls in 1+d dimensions , which is based on identical return exponents @xmath45 for two replicas to meet .",
    "the validity of a relation based on properties of a single replica pair suggests that the critical properties of dls in a short - range random potential are governed by replica pair interactions .",
    "the mapping can make dl transitions in high dimensions computationally accessible , which we demonstrated in showing that the two - replica overlap provides a valid order parameter across the localization transition of sdls in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "furthermore , the importance of pair interactions suggests that the critical temperature for dls in random potentials is indeed identical to the temperature below which the ratio of the second moment of the partition function and the square of its first moment diverges , which implies that the localization transition temperature @xmath362 in a random potential equals the replica pair transition temperature @xmath363 for replica pair binding .",
    "the equality @xmath494 has been originally put forward and verified numerically for dls in 1 + 3 dimensions @xcite . using the numerical transfer matrix approach we could verify this conjecture also for sdls in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "our findings are summarized schematically in figs.[fig : result2 ] and [ fig : result ] .",
    "the binding transition of dl pairs becomes discontinuous for @xmath495 and , analogously , the binding of sdl pairs for @xmath496 @xcite . because dls in random potentials are equivalent to the kpz equation @xcite , the validated relation to the sdl suggests that the roughening transition of the kpz problem could acquire similar discontinuous features for @xmath495 dimensions .",
