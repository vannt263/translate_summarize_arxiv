    "the calculation of radiative corrections in atoms with low nuclear charge @xmath3 is facilitated by the fact that binding corrections , which enter as powers and logarithms of @xmath4 , are relatively small , and can be treated in perturbation theory . for atoms with high nuclear charge",
    "the perturbation expansion converges more slowly , and for highly - charged ions the expansion is generally avoided , which is possible when numerical methods are used to represent the electron propagator .",
    "this approach , first introduced by wichmann and kroll @xcite for the vacuum polarization and brown and mayers @xcite for the self - energy , has been applied to the calculation of both energy levels , notably by mohr and collaborators @xcite , and more recently to matrix elements , specifically hyperfine splitting ( hfs ) and the zeeman effect @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to further extend this kind of radiative correction calculation to the parity nonconserving ( pnc ) process @xmath5 in neutral cesium @xcite .",
    "corrections to this transition are of importance for the question of whether a breakdown of the standard model is present for cesium pnc .",
    "specifically , if the radiative correction to the electron - z vertex is taken to be its lowest - order value , @xmath6 , then based on the the present status of other corrections to pnc which have included a number of significant shifts only recently considered that arise from the breit interaction @xcite and vacuum polarization @xcite , a discrepancy with experiment of approximately @xmath7 would result .",
    "given the presence of other indications of possible problems with electroweak tests of the standard model , specifically the nutev result @xcite and hadronic asymmetries in @xmath8 @xcite , a discrepancy in cesium pnc could be an indication of new physics .",
    "however , it is known that binding corrections to the similar matrix element involved in hfs are very large for highly - charged ions .",
    "that this is so is not surprising , given the first two terms of the one - loop vertex correction to hfs @xcite , @xmath9 , \\label{eq : eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the lowest - order hfs energy .",
    "already at @xmath11 the leading binding correction leads to a change in sign of the hfs , and at @xmath12 the formula would predict @xmath13 , as compared to the low - order , uncorrected value of @xmath14 .",
    "of course , with @xmath4 = 0.4 , the above equation , even with known higher - order terms included , can not replace an exact evaluation . as mentioned above ,",
    "such evaluations have been carried out by a number of groups , and the complete answer turns out to be @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "it is possible to carry out a parallel analysis for radiative corrections to pnc .",
    "if we define the lowest - order pnc matrix element as @xmath16 and the one - loop radiatively corrected matrix element as @xmath17 , with @xmath18 the first two terms of @xmath19 are @xmath20 where the first term is part of the standard radiative correction for atomic pnc @xcite and the leading binding correction was first calculated in ref .  @xcite . for the case of cesium",
    "this formula changes the coefficient of @xmath21 from -0.5 to -2.98 , changing a negligible -0.12 percent to a significant -0.69 percent shift .",
    "this largely removes the @xmath7 discrepancy between theory and experiment .",
    "there are a number of issues that must be addressed before accepting the -0.69 percent shift at face value .",
    "firstly , just as with hfs , an approach that does not rely on expansion in @xmath4 is required .",
    "even though the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq1 ] ) for the vertex correction to hfs give an answer within 12 percent of the total answer , there is no reason we know of for this to be true in general .",
    "secondly , it is not clear that it is correct to use @xmath12 in the above equation .",
    "when the cesium 6s lamb shift , which is also governed by short distance effects , is studied with all - orders methods @xcite , a much smaller effective nuclear charge is seen , specifically about 14 .",
    "thirdly , an important difference between pnc and hfs is the role of gauge invariance . in the latter case",
    "the initial and final states are real physical states .",
    "however , the z boson vertex does not involve two physical states , instead involving either a @xmath22 or @xmath23 state and an intermediate state with @xmath24 quantum numbers . while it can be shown that eq .",
    "( [ eq : perturb ] ) is still valid in this case , higher - order binding corrections will be gauge dependent .    to address the last issue",
    ", we choose here to work with a gauge - invariant quantity , the matrix element of the weak hamiltonian @xmath25 between the @xmath26 and @xmath27 states of a hydrogenic ion , where @xmath28 describes the distribution of the weak nuclear charge , which is close to the neutron distribution .",
    "while a finite distribution will be used for @xmath28 , the atomic @xmath26 and @xmath27 states will be chosen to be solutions of the dirac equation with a point nucleus , so the energies of these two states are equal .",
    "this allows radiative corrections to pnc to be studied nonperturbatively to all orders in @xmath2 in a manner parallel to that used for hfs @xcite , and in particular gives information about the @xmath2 behavior of the function @xmath19 that will be useful when the cesium problem is addressed , as will be discussed in the conclusion .",

    ", it is shown that the numerical evaluation at low @xmath3 agrees with the perturbative expansion , and the higher - order binding corrections inferred .",
    "prospects for extension of the calculation to the actual experiment , where a laser photon is present driving the @xmath30 transition , are also discussed .",
    "the matrix element of the weak charge operator in lowest order is @xmath31 where we shall from now on suppress the overall factor @xmath32 , use @xmath33 to denote the @xmath27 state , and @xmath34 the @xmath26 state .",
    "the nuclear distribution is chosen to be uniform , with a radius @xmath35 fixed so that the root - mean - square radius agrees with a fermi distribution with a thickness parameter 2.3 fm and a @xmath36 parameter given in table [ tab : tab1 ] . because of the simplicity of the uniform distribution the matrix element can be evaluated analytically , and is @xmath37 here @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the bohr radius .",

    "results of @xmath16 are tabulated in table [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "a principal advantage of treating the degenerate case , where the states involved in the matrix elements have the same energy , is the simplicity of the formalism . in the more general case , when the energies are different , the radiative correction to the weak interaction matrix element has to involve the laser field photon that drives the transition , otherwise one would not be dealing with a gauge - invariant amplitude . in the degenerate case",
    "we can restrict our attention to the gauge - invariant subset of diagrams shown in fig .",

    ", the similar problem of radiative correction to hyperfine splitting has already been treated in the literature @xcite , but in the present case the initial and final states are different , and the formalism requires some modifications .",
    "the bound state wave functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 are solutions of the dirac equation in the field of a point nucleus",
    ". therefore they can be interpreted as residues at poles of dirac - coulomb propagators as a function of energy @xmath47 , @xmath48 when radiative corrections are involved , the dirac - coulomb propagator is corrected by the electron self - interaction @xmath49 @xmath50 the new position of the pole and corresponding residues are @xmath51 where by @xmath52 one denotes a reduced coulomb - dirac propagator , namely the propagator with the @xmath53-state excluded . with the help of the above equations , we now present the one - loop radiative corrections to @xmath16 .",

    "they are ( @xmath56 ) @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 there is still an ambiguity in the above formulas , related to the fact that at least one of the states is unstable with respect to radiative decay .",
    "this means that , for example , derivative terms , which have the interpretation of bound state wave function renormalization , acquire a small imaginary part .",
    "we think that this imaginary term may have a small effect on the weak matrix element .",
    "nevertheless , in our treatment we completely ignore this imaginary part for simplicity . to include it properly would require a more detailed treatment of the excitation and decay process . before the numerical integration",
    ", we present in the next section the analytic calculation of the first two terms in the @xmath2 expansion .",
    "in the @xmath2 expansion one performs a simplification , similar to that used for the lamb shift , which leads to an exact expression for the expansion terms . specifically , the first two terms are given by the on - mass - shell scattering amplitude , which because it involves the weak charge of the nucleus , is dominated by the large momentum region , with characteristic momenta of the order of the electron mass , and to smaller extent of the order of the inverse of nuclear size .",
    "the small momentum region contributes at order @xmath60 and will be included in the numerical treatment .",
