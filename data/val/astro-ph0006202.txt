    "the origin of the galactic x - ray background has remained a puzzle since its discovery during the pioneering rocket experiments of bleach et al .",
    "( 1972 ) . since then , x - ray emission from the galactic plane and , in particular , the ridge ( the narrow region around the galactic center covering from @xmath4 in longitude and @xmath5 in latitude ) has been studied with every major x - ray observatory . below 10  kev ,",
    "the spectrum is rich in emission lines from fe , mg , si and s ( e.g. kaneda et al . 1997 ; hereafter k97 ) . above 10  kev ,",
    "a power law component is clearly detected ( e.g. yamasaki et al .",
    "1997 ; valinia & marshall 1998 ) with an exponential cutoff near 40  kev ( valinia , kinzer & marshall 2000 , hereafter vkm00 ) .",
    "both diffuse and discrete sources have been proposed for the origin of this emission .",
    "rs  cvn binaries and cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) have been considered as significant contributors to the emission below 10  kev .",
    "however , ottmann & schmitt ( 1992 ) have estimated that only 1% of the iron k line detected in the unresolved galactic background spectrum is due to rs  cvns .",
    "kaneda ( 1997 ) has shown that in order for cvs to make up the diffuse emission , their space density would have to be a factor of  100 larger than previously estimated ( patterson 1984 ) . recently , from the analysis of rosat pspc data , tanaka , miyaji & hasinger ( 1999 ) have shown that a class of hard sources with @xmath6 and as abundant as stellar coronal sources is required to account for the unresolved ridge emission .",
    "no such class of sources has been identified .",
    "the discovery using _ tenma _ of the iron k line in the ridge spectrum motivated the idea that the emission below 10  kev is due to a diffuse , hot , optically - thin plasma of temperature 515  kev ( koyama et al . 1986 ) .",
    "later , high resolution measurements of the ridge spectrum using asca revealed a complex emission line structure .",
    "the asca spectrum can not be satisfactorily modeled with a single thermal component in ionization equilibrium ( k97 ) . instead , k97 modeled the emission by two non - equilibrium ionization components with temperatures of @xmath7 and 7  kev . while this model provides a good fit to the spectrum , it is difficult to explain the production and confinement of such hot gas uniformly permeating the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "supernova remnant shock temperatures reach only about 3  kev . also , the 7  kev temperature exceeds the gravitational potential of the disk by at least one order of magnitude ( townes 1989 ) .",
    "therefore , according to this model , the hot gas must be constantly and uniformly replenished in the galaxy . to overcome this difficulty , tanuma et al .",
    "( 1999 ) consider heating and confinement of the plasma in the galactic plane via magnetic reconnection .",
    "they numerically investigate how magnetic reconnection triggered by supernova explosions heats the plasma which is consequently confined in magnetic islands .",
    "they conclude that for this mechanism to work , local magnetic fields of @xmath8 g are necessary .",
    "this model implies that the hot plasma must be very localized .",
    "another problem with the purely thermal scenario is that the two - temperature model can not account for the data above 10  kev , which require at least one additional component at higher energies .",
    "simultaneous rxte and osse observations up to 1  mev show the presence of an additional component in the spectrum that can be characterized as an exponentially cut - off power law ( vkm00 ) .",
    "this component dominates in the 10 - 400  kev band and contributes approximately 35% of the total 3 - 10  kev emission .",
    "vkm00 estimated that up to @xmath9 of the emission at 60  kev is due to discrete sources , with the rest remaining unresolved .",
    "these results imply that there is a nonthermal contribution to the galactic ridge emission below 10 kev .",
    "this paper explores some of the consequences .",
    "the unresolved hard x - ray / soft @xmath0-ray diffuse component detected by rxte and osse can be produced either by bremsstrahlung from low energy cosmic ray electrons ( @xmath10  mev ; lecre ) or inverse compton scattering off ultra - relativistic ( @xmath110.1 - 10 gev ) electrons ( e.g. skibo & ramaty 1993 ) .",
    "however , skibo , ramaty & purcell ( 1996 ) have shown that the emission up to 100  kev is more likely of electron bremsstrahlung origin , because a large population of ultra - relativistic electrons would also produce a significant galactic synchrotron radio emission at @xmath11100 mhz and this is not observed .",
    "in addition to the bremsstrahlung continuum , lecre produce nonthermal narrow x - ray emission lines below 10  kev via k - shell vacancy creation in ambient heavy atoms .",
    "low energy cosmic ray ions ( lecri ) also produce characteristic broad and narrow x - ray emission lines ( tatischeff , ramaty & kozlovsky 1998 and references therein , dogiel et al .",
    "their contribution to the galactic ridge diffuse emission has been considered by tatischeff , ramaty & valinia ( 1999 ) and tanaka , miyaji & hasinger ( 1999 ) .",
    "however , we show in  4 that lecri can not account for the galactic x - ray background because their nonthermal x - ray production would be accompanied by a nuclear @xmath0-ray line diffuse emission exceeding the upper limits obtained using osse , as well as by an unreasonably high galaxy - wide be production rate . for these reasons , we focus on the role of low energy cosmic ray electrons in nonthermal x - ray production below 10  kev .    in this paper ,",
    "we report on the analysis of @xmath12  ks archival asca data from the scutum arm region on the galactic plane . instead of applying non - equilibrium ionization models ,",
    "we show that an alternative model , namely nonthermal x - rays from the interaction of lecre with the ism plus two thermal plasma components ( of @xmath2  kev and 0.6  kev ) produces an equally good fit to the spectrum .",
    "according to our best fit model , the thermal and nonthermal components contribute 81% and 11% , respectively , of the @xmath13  kev emission , with the remaining emission contributed by the cosmic x - ray background .",
    "( in the 4 - 9  kev band , the thermal and nonthermal components contribute 38% and 36% , respectively . ) in  2 we investigate the x - ray line and continuum emission from the interaction of lecre with the ism . in ",
    "3 we present the data and our analysis and in  4 we discuss the implications of our results .",
    "in the lecre scenario , nonthermal x - ray line emission results from the filling of inner - shell vacancies produced by the fast electrons in the ambient atoms .",
    "we assumed the x - ray production region to be neutral and of solar composition ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) and considered the k@xmath14 and k@xmath15 lines from ambient c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , s and fe . the transition energies are given in tatischeff et al .",
    "( 1998 , table  6 ) . the x - ray line production cross section can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the cross section for the collisional ionization leading to the k - shell vacancy , @xmath18 is the fluorescence yield for the k shell ( krause 1979 ) and @xmath19 is the relative line intensity among the possible transitions which can fill the inner - shell vacancy ( salem , panossian , & krause 1974 ) . for the k - shell ionization cross section , we used the semiempirical formula of quarles ( 1976 ) , which is in good agreement with the data compiled in long et al .",
    "since the intrinsic width of the x - ray lines is smaller than the asca energy resolution , the determination of the exact line profiles is beyond the scope of this paper . for simplicity",
    ", we adopted the same width for all the lines , @xmath20=10 ev , which is the approximate width of the 6.40 kev fe line in a cold ambient medium ( dogiel et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "x - ray continuum emission is essentially due to bremsstrahlung from the fast primary electrons .",
    "we estimated bremsstrahlung from knock - on secondary electrons to be of minor importance above 0.5 kev .",
    "we considered primary electron bremsstrahlung in ambient h and he and calculated the corresponding differential cross sections from equation ( 3bn ) in koch & motz ( 1959 ) .    the differential x - ray production rate can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the density of the ambient isotope @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the differential equilibrium electron number as a function of the electron kinetic energy @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the electron velocity and @xmath27 is the differential x - ray production cross section for electron interactions with particles of type @xmath23 . we perform calculations with an electron equilibrium spectrum of the form @xmath28",
    "figure 1 shows the x - ray emission produced by a lecre population with @xmath29=0.3 and @xmath30=90 kev , which provides a good fit to the rxte and osse scutum arm data ( see  3 ) .",
    "the calculations are normalized to a total kinetic energy in the fast electrons @xmath31=@xmath32=1 erg and an average ambient h density of @xmath33 . the spectral index @xmath29=0.3 could be due to the injection of electrons of energies @xmath34 into the neutral phase of the ism .",
    "indeed , the equilibrium electron spectrum would then satisfy @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the electron source spectrum ( it is assumed that @xmath37 for @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 is the electron energy loss rate in a neutral ambient medium , which is roughly proportional to @xmath40 below @xmath11100 kev ( berger & seltzer 1982 ) . as shown in figure  1 , the continuum emission is accompanied by strong x - ray lines in the asca energy range .",
    "we used archival asca gis data of the on - plane ( i.e. @xmath41 ) scutum arm region from galactic longitude @xmath42 .",
    "overall , 10 pointings with a total good time exposure of @xmath12  ks were used .",
    "these observations were performed from 1993 to 1997 . for spectral analysis ,",
    "data from the central region of the gis with radius less than @xmath43 was used , as this is the default cut - off radius in the asca standard processing products . within this radius",
    ", spectral resolution is known to be uniform , and the long term gain change and positional gain variation is calibrated within @xmath44 ( makishima et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the average count rate in the 0.5 - 10 kev band after removing point sources was @xmath45 for gis2 and @xmath46 for gis3 .",
    "we were not able to make significant use of sis data since fewer photons were collected by those instruments ( the field of view for the sis being much smaller than that for the gis ) and furthermore the degradation of the sis response in later observations reduced the utility of that instrument .",
    "since the emission region is larger than the gis field - of - view , `` stray light effects '' have to be taken into account . for the purpose of this analysis ,",
    "an xrt response ( i.e. ancillary response file or arf ) has been constructed by taking into account the stray - light effects up to @xmath47 from the xrt axis .",
    "the procedure is as follows .",
    "we randomly generated one - million x - ray photons within @xmath47 of the optical axis , and using ray - tracing calculated the number of photons which reached the detector plane .",
    "we repeated this procedure for 300 monochromatic energies from 0.1 to 12  kev . from these ray - traced images , taking account of the gis detector response , we calculated the arf for the diffuse emission corresponding to the detector region used ( which excluded any point sources ) . for each energy bin ,",
    "@xmath48 where @xmath29 is the geometrical opening area of the asca x - ray telescope ( @xmath49 ) , @xmath50 is the solid angle of the assumed spatial extent ( @xmath51  str ) , and @xmath52 is the number of photons to have reached the detector region concerned .",
    "this is basically the same method described in k97 .",
    "we also calculated the diffuse arf for a more realistic distribution of the emission along the galactic plane .",
    "we assumed that the spatial distribution of emission was gaussian in latitude with a @xmath53 fwhm ( as measured by valinia & marshall 1998 ) and constant in longitude .",
    "we found an insignificant difference in the best fit model parameters with the two different arfs . in what follows",
    "we show results obtained with the arf made assuming uniform emission from a circle of radius @xmath54 .    since the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb )",
    "is absorbed by the galactic plane at energies below @xmath55  kev , we subtracted only the instrumental background from the data and included the cxb as a fixed component in the model .",
    "archival night earth observations were used to determine the instrumental background . from the analysis of the blank sky gis2 and gis3 archival data , we found that the cxb was best fitted with a power law function @xmath56 .",
    "the best fit parameters were @xmath57 and @xmath58 @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xmath61 at 1  kev for gis2 and gis3 , respectively .",
    "in all the fits reported below the cxb component was absorbed by the best - fit galactic hydrogen column .",
    "we simultaneously fit the gis2 and gis3 spectra .",
    "because the emission is faint , we found that many channels were short of the @xmath62 counts minimum required to yield meaningful @xmath63 statistics .",
    "therefore , before fitting the data , we binned channels 0 - 511 by a factor of 2 and channels 512 - 1023 by a factor of 8 .",
    "this resulted in at least 20 counts in each bin .",
    "since the complex shape of the fe k line is the prime focus of this paper , we first analyzed the 4 - 9  kev data ( the channels above 9  kev have insufficient counts to be worth including in the fit ) . at these energies ,",
    "the spectrum is little affected by the absorption due to the galactic hydrogen column density .",
    "our first attempt was to model the data using a single thermal plasma component ( the mekal model ; mewe , gronenschild , & van den oord 1985 ; mewe , lemen , & van den oord 1986 ; kaastra 1992 ) absorbed by the galactic plane .",
    "we derived a best fit temperature of @xmath64 kev .",
    "the result of this fit is shown in figure 2a .",
    "the fit around the fe k line is very poor .",
    "therefore , we modeled the data using a thermal bremsstrahlung plus a gaussian line component , as was also done by k97 .",
    "the result of this with a best fit temperature parameter of @xmath65 kev is shown in figure 2b .",
    "notice that the quality of the fit around the fe k line has dramatically improved but the width ( @xmath66  ev ) suggests that the line is intrinsically broad . also , the peak line energy is detected at @xmath67  kev , a lower energy than that expected from a plasma in ionization equilibrium .",
    "next , we modeled the data with the nonthermal lecre component .",
    "however , since the parameters of this component are directly related to the emission above 10  kev , we _",
    "first _ used the rxte and osse scutum arm measurements of vkm00 to constrain the shape of the electron equilibrium spectrum ( i.e. @xmath29 and @xmath30 in eq .",
    "vkm00 modeled the 3 - 400 kev spectrum with an absorbed thermal model plus an exponentially cutoff power law .",
    "we replaced the exponentially cutoff power law with the lecre model and found that any spectral index @xmath68 provided equally satisfactory fits to the data .",
    "we fixed the spectral index at @xmath69 , consistent with the scenario that accelerated electrons of energies @xmath34 are injected into a neutral medium ( see  2 ) . for the exponential turn - over energy , we found a best fit @xmath70  kev .",
    "the best fit result is obtained when it is assumed that the broad band diffuse emission has a spatial gaussian distribution of fwhm @xmath71 which is consistent with the interpretation that the hard x - ray / soft @xmath0-ray emission is confined to a @xmath72 thin disk centered roughly on the galactic midplane .",
    "indeed , from the rxte survey of the galactic plane , valinia & marshall ( 1998 ) find two spatial components for the diffuse emission : a thin disk of full width @xmath73 centered roughly on the galactic midplane and a broad component of gaussian distribution with fwhm of about @xmath74 .",
    "moreover , this is consistent with the observation that the fe k line is either extremely weak or not detected at all in asca measurements of the galactic plane diffuse emission at high latitudes , @xmath75  kev ) , we fit the 4 - 9 kev asca data with an absorbed lecre model .",
    "however , this model did not produce a satisfactory fit to the data .",
    "in particular , the quality of the fit around the fe k line was very poor .",
    "we then modeled the data with an absorbed lecre plus a thermal plasma component .",
    "this provides a satisfactory fit to the entire energy range , including the fe k line .",
    "this line appears to be broadened and shifted to 6.6 kev because it is a combination of the 6.4 kev lecre line and the 6.7 kev from he - like fe . because the thermal plasma component has a temperature of @xmath76  kev",
    "there is a negligible contribution from the 6.97 kev line of h - like fe .",
    "the parameters of this fit are shown in the top panel of table  1 .    extending this model down to 0.6  kev",
    ", we found that it provided a good fit to the data only in the 2 - 9  kev band .",
    "below 2  kev , the data significantly exceeded the model , requiring an additional low temperature component . adding a second thermal plasma component to the above model and fitting for the best parameters yielded a good fit to the overall spectrum .",
    "the parameters of this model are given in the bottom panel of table  1 .",
    "these results suggest that there is a nearby low - temperature thermal component ( @xmath1  kev ) which accounts for the soft x - ray emission of the galactic background ( as implied by the low value of the hydrogen column density ) .",
    "the hard x - ray component ( i.e. @xmath77  kev ) is produced from superposition of a thermal component ( @xmath78  kev gas ) and a nonthermal lecre component , absorbed through a larger hydrogen column .",
    "figure  3a shows the data and folded model .",
    "figure  3b shows the unfolded spectrum and model components .",
    "the composite thermal plus lecre model in table  1 provides the best fit to the asca data . in this scenario ,",
    "most of the emission below 2  kev is due to a thermal plasma component at @xmath1  kev .",
    "the hard x - ray emission above 2  kev is due to a combination of a hotter plasma component at @xmath78  kev , which may have been shock heated in supernova explosions , and a lecre component which may also be related to supernova explosions , and which would account for part of the rxte and osse data above 10 kev .",
    "we have assumed that this component is limited to the central @xmath79 of the galactic plane .",
    "this model produces a very good fit to the overall spectrum and , in particular , to the fe k line complex .",
    "this is because the apparent broadening and shift in the mean energy of the fe k line is produced by a combination of the thermal lines from de - excitation in he - like fe and the nonthermal lines , primarily at 6.4  kev , due to k - shell vacancy production in ambient neutral fe .",
    "the asca sis should be able to resolve the nonthermal 6.4  kev line from the thermal lines at @xmath80  kev .",
    "however , for the scutum arm region the signal - to - noise is not sufficient to draw any conclusions . k97",
    "have summed asca sis data over a larger latitude range in order to have enough counts to examine the shape of the fe k line .",
    "they found clear evidence for photons with energies below that of the he - like line at @xmath80  kev and no evidence of emission at 6.4  kev .",
    "however , since the lecre are likely confined close to the plane we expect any 6.4  kev line to be diluted in the k97 data",
    ". the photons with energies below that from the he - like line are from lower - ionization stages of fe and are not predicted by thermal emission from a collisional plasma .",
    "as k97 correctly pointed out , this is good evidence for plasma that is out of ionization equilibrium .",
    "we differ from k97 in not requiring as high a continuum temperature so the plasma can be closer to equilibrium .",
    "the rxte and osse scutum arm data above 10 kev are best modeled by a hard electron equilibrium spectrum ( @xmath68 ) which could result from the injection of electrons accelerated in a low - density ionized medium into a denser neutral medium in which they would produce most of the nonthermal x - rays . assuming an average h density of @xmath81 in the x - ray production region , we calculated that a total electron kinetic energy of @xmath82 is needed to produce the 0.6 - 9 kev luminosity in the lecre component of @xmath83 ( table  1 ) .",
    "dividing this suprathermal electron energy by the estimated volume of the emission ( @xmath84 ) leads to an energy density of @xmath85 , comparable to the cosmic ray ion energy density of @xmath86 in the galaxy ( e.g. wdowczyk & wolfendale 1989 ) .",
    "therefore , on energetic grounds the lecre scenario is plausible .",
    "the lecre may be accelerated in supernovae remnants ( e.g. yamasaki et al .",
    "1997 ) or by ambient interstellar plasma turbulence ( schlickeiser 1997 ) .",
    "we now show that low energy cosmic ray ions ( lecri ) can not contribute significantly to the hard x - ray emission .",
    "lecri which produce nonthermal x - rays via atomic interactions also produce gamma - ray emission and the light elements li , be and b via nuclear reactions ( ramaty et al . 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "the calculated 3 - 7 mev nuclear gamma - ray line fluxes , and galaxy - wide be production rates that would accompany the x - ray emission are shown in figure  4a and 4b , respectively .",
    "for these calculations , we used the same interaction model as ramaty et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and tatischeff et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and an accelerated ion source spectrum also used by these authors , @xmath87 we employed three different compositions for the lecri : crs and crs@xmath88 ( ramaty et al . 1997 ) and ob@xmath89 ( parizot , cass & vangioni - flam 1997 ) .",
    "crs is the composition of the current epoch galactic cosmic - ray sources ; crs@xmath88 is identical to crs , but without protons and @xmath14 particles ; ob@xmath89 is the calculated average composition of the stellar winds from ob associations in the inner galaxy .",
    "the calculations are normalized to a nonthermal x - ray production by the fast ions of @xmath90 in the 2 - 9 kev energy range , which is the luminosity of the lecre component in our best fit model ( table  1 ) . in figure  4a , the predicted gamma - ray line fluxes",
    "are compared with the upper limits obtained with osse for both broad and narrow line emissions from the central radian of the galaxy ( harris et al .",
    "the crs@xmath88 composition produces only broad gamma - ray lines , whereas the crs and ob@xmath89 compositions also produce intense narrow lines , from the interactions of accelerated protons and @xmath14 particles with ambient @xmath91c and @xmath92o .",
    "thus , only the crs@xmath88 composition with @xmath937 mev / nucleon does not violate the osse upper limits ( fig .",
    "furthermore , it is shown in figure  4b that the predicted be production rates significantly exceed the nominal value obtained from the observation of the linear correlation between be and fe for [ fe / h]@xmath94 - 1 , @xmath95=@xmath96 be - atoms s@xmath97 ( ramaty et al . 1997 , ramaty & lingenfelter 1998 ) , with the exception of very low energy ions of crs@xmath88 or crs composition .",
    "moreover , nonthermal x - ray production by such very low energy ions is very inefficient .",
    "we find that lecri with @xmath98 mev / nucleon should deposit more than @xmath99 in the ism to produce the 2 - 9 kev luminosity of @xmath100 , exceeding by more than a factor of 2 the total power delivered by galactic supernovae , @xmath101 ( ramaty & lingenfelter 1998 ) .",
    "we thus conclude that lecri do not significantly contribute to the hard x - ray emission below 10  kev . using different ion source spectra , pohl ( 1998 ) and tatischeff , ramaty & valinia ( 1999 )",
    "have shown that lecri can not account for the x - ray data above 10 kev either .",
    "although the resolution of the asca data does not allow us to distinguish between purely non - equilibrium ionization and lecre plus thermal models , we contend that the non - equilibrium ionization models are generally disfavored .",
    "this is because the purely thermal models require a very hot gas ( @xmath3  kev ) that is uniformly produced and confined in the galactic disk ( a very contrived scenario ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of a nonthermal component for the emission is demonstrated by hard x - ray / soft @xmath0-ray observations of the galactic background ( e.g. yamasaki et al .",
    "1997 ; valinia & marshall 1998 ; vkm00 ; boggs et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the lecre model along with a shock heated plasma component ( both of which may have been created in supernovae explosions ) provide a plausible explanation for the diffuse galactic background emission .",
    "observations performed with xmm are expected to be able to distinguish between these scenarios because of its high throughput and ccd spectral resolution .",
