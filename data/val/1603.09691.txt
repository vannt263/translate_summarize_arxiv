    "the theoretical calculations within the standard model ( sm ) have reached the high level of precision of the experiments .",
    "on one hand , the calculation for the electron @xmath4 , considering only qed up to tenth order , gives the result of @xmath5  @xcite , giving a difference of @xmath6 which is close to one standard deviation . on the other hand , for the muon @xmath7 , calculations considering qed up to five loops and hadronic vacuum polarization up to next - to - leading order , hadronic light - by - light scattering and electroweak contributions results in @xmath8  @xcite , leading to a difference between theory and experiment of @xmath9 a difference that goes beyond three standard deviations from the experimental result .",
    "this difference between the sm prediction and the experimental value of the muon anomalous magnetic moment has been studied in many models .",
    "for instance , in other 3 - 3 - 1 models  @xcite , left - right symmetric models  @xcite , supersymmetric models  @xcite and two - higgs doublets models  @xcite .    at the same time that the agreement between the experiment and the sm for the electron amdm gives us confidence in the correctness of the theory ,",
    "the disagreement in the muon case suggests that there may be effects unaccounted by the sm , or it is still possible that such effects come from new particles and through their interactions with the already known particles .",

    "we will show that , at least in a particular model , it is not possible to fit both @xmath10 at @xmath11 , and at @xmath12 it is possible to fit both , but it imposes a strong limit on the energy scale at which new physics may arise . also , usually in literature the charged lepton masses are neglected , thus allowing to obtain simple expressions for the @xmath13 . in the later cases , @xmath14",
    "however , in this cases @xmath15 implying that @xmath16 which is over @xmath17 from the sm predictions .",
    "hence , it is important not to neglect the charged lepton masses , since their effect could be very important for these small parameters .",

    "@xcite and @xcite . an important issue that in general can not be neglected in 3 - 3 - 1 models are the contributions of the scalars and pseudo - scalars , since sometimes there are important positive and/or negative interference with the amplitudes with the amplitudes involving other particles in the model  @xcite , in the 331hl that we are considering , these vertices are proportional to the lepton masses and thus they are negligible .",
    "this is because , unlike the minimal 3 - 3 - 1 model , there is only source of the lepton masses and it implies that there are no flavor changing neutral currents mediated by ( pseudo)scalars .",

    "hence , the arbitrary matrix @xmath192 has to be taken into account in the m331 .    in another example , ref .",
    "@xcite considered solutions to the muon anomaly in the context of the minimal 331 , the 331 model with heavy neutral fermions , and the 331 model with heavy charged leptons but with five left - handed lepton triplets , thus the latter one is different from the 331hl model here considered .",
    "again , the results are all approximated and since all flavor mixings are neglected their results are , as before , of the form @xmath193 .",
    "the masses of the usual charged leptons can be neglected in the loops because they appear as @xmath194 or @xmath195 .",
    "the first is negligible by the neutrino masses and the second by the value of @xmath118 .",
    "another important point to be stressed is that , in @xcite not all the particles in each model are considered .",
    "it happens that in the model they were considering , the importance of the scalar contributions can not be neglected _ a priori _ because they depend on the yukawa couplings through the unitary matrices that diagonalize quarks and lepton mass matrices , as discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "for instance , in the m331 there are fcnc via the scalar sector , and in this case the scalar contributions may be important as in the quark sector  @xcite .",
    "we must put in context our results . on one hand ,",
    "they were obtained in the 331hl where there are not flavor changing neutral interactions in the lepton sector .",
    "moreover , unlike the minimal 331 model , the singly charged vector bilepton @xmath196 does not contribute to the mdm of the known charged leptons .",
    "for example , this is not the case with the m331 where there are more scalar multiplets and fcnc in the lepton sector via the exchange of neutral higgs . on the other hand ,",
    "they were obtained using the matrices @xmath197 in eqs .",
    "( a6 ) - ( a7 ) .",
    "these matrices are a possible solution , they may have other values and it is possible that these values might imply solutions for both mdm . the moral of the story , is that besides the unitary matrices , the mdm of the electron must be taken into account when solutions for the case of muon are proposed , once both mdms may be incompatible . otherwise , the results can not be considered as definitive .",
    "the authors would like to thank cnpq for full ( g.d.c . ) and partial ( v.p . ) financial support .",
    "in the following equations we denote : @xmath198 with @xmath199 . the neutral ( pseudo)scalars @xmath200 , and @xmath201 . since in this model there is only one physical pseudo - scalar we denote @xmath202 .",
    "when @xmath203 is the scalar with mass about 125 gev , with @xmath204 , see  @xcite .",
    "here we have the form factors appearing in ( [ as ] ) ( @xmath205 fixed ) @xmath206 notice that the scalar @xmath203 has no @xmath207 vertex and the pseudo - scalar @xmath208 has no @xmath70 vertex because in this model there is no fcncs in the higgs sector .",
    "hence , they cancel out .",
    "this is not the case in the minimal 331 model since in this case there are fcnc in the higgs sector and the vertices are chiral .          where @xmath215 and @xmath216 . where the constants @xmath217 and @xmath218 are defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "we assumed that the heavy leptons are in the diagonal basis , @xmath219 and that in ( [ aae4 ] ) , the @xmath142 is real , i.e. , @xmath220 .",
    "the numerical values of the @xmath170 matrices were obtained in ref .",

    "( [ yukawa ] ) the following values : @xmath223    in the interactions above , the matrix @xmath224 in ( [ vlr ] ) can always be eliminated by using the mass matrix .",
    "this behavior is typical of the present model . in the m331 one ,",
    "@xmath224 survive in some interactions with scalars . again",
    ", this is a consequence that in the 331hl model there are no fcncs in the scalar sector .        from the lepton lagrangian we may find the interaction with photon of the known leptons , @xmath225 and extra leptons @xmath226 : @xmath227 and identify the electron charge as @xmath228 where @xmath21 is the modulus of the electron charge and @xmath229 .",
