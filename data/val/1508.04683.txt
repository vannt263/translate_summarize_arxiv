    "@xcite indicated that the problem of what controls the relaxation time of viscous liquids might be simplified , if instead of pressure @xmath0 and temperature @xmath1 , one focuses on density @xmath2 and temperature .",
    "it was found that the dynamics of _ ortho_-terphenyl , measured at different state points can be collapsed onto a single curve by plotting it as a function of @xmath3 , with @xmath4 .",
    "later results have shown that the dynamics of many liquids can be collapsed when plotted as a function of @xmath3 , albeit with a material - dependent @xmath5  @xcite . a review by roland _ et al . _",
    "@xcite established that for many liquids @xmath5 is well approximated by a power law of the density , @xmath6 , with @xmath7 being a material specific scaling parameter .",
    "we refer to this as _ power - law _",
    "density scaling .",
    "the fact that the dynamics of some liquids were found to be a function of the combined variable @xmath8 indicated that there might be a single underlying quantity that `` controls '' the dynamics .",
    "some liquids have strong correlations in the equilibrium fluctuations of the energy and pressure  @xcite .",

    "these only depend on the positions of the particles @xmath12 , in contrast to the kinetic energy @xmath13 and the temperature , which only depend on the momenta of the particles @xmath14 : @xmath15 the @xmath16 correlations are quantified by the standard pearson correlation coefficient @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the difference from the mean ( @xmath19 ) and angular brackets denote the nvt ensemble average ( constant number of particles , volume , and temperature ) . liquids with @xmath20",
    "were initially called `` strongly correlating '' , but since this sometimes led to confusion with strongly correlated quantum systems , they are now referred to as `` roskilde simple '' liquids or just `` r liquids ''  @xcite .",
    "the discovery of this class of liquids subsequently led to the development of the isomorph theory  @xcite .",
    "the isomorph theory explains why r liquids have many properties that make them simpler than other liquids .",
    "the main prediction is that liquids that belong to this class have curves in their phase diagram called _ isomorphs _ along which many properties are invariant .",
    "the invariance includes the dynamics , structure , and excess entropy ( the entropy minus the entropy of the ideal gas at same temperature and density )  @xcite .",
    "these liquids thus have a phase diagram that is effectively one dimensional for many properties ( but not for , e.g. , the pressure and the free energy ) .",
    "the isomorph theory provides a theoretical explanation for the empirical power - law density scaling .",
    "the theory does not assume anything about the functional form of @xmath5 , and it was indeed discovered that for many model liquids  @xcite and two real liquids  @xcite that @xmath5 is not well approximated by a power law if the change in density is larger than 10 - 20% .",
    "power - law density scaling is a good approximation when density changes are small , which is often the case in experiments .",
    "simple power - law density scaling also works in the case of low - density supercritical fluids  @xcite .",
    "another advantage of the isomorph theory is that it provides a prediction for the ( density - dependent ) value of @xmath7 , which was previously treated as an empirical parameter .",
    "thus , @xmath7 can be estimated independently of the scaling procedure , although this is much more easily done in computer simulations  @xcite than in experiments  @xcite .",
    "the isomorph theory is consistent with another scaling method , which was proposed by rosenfeld  @xcite and later in a slightly different form by dzugutov  @xcite . in this scaling the dynamics of many liquids were found to be a function of the excess entropy . since excess entropy and the dynamics are both invariant along isomorphs , this is in agreement with the isomorph theory , although the isomorph theory does not predict which function expresses the relaxation time in terms of the excess entropy .",
    "initially , the isomorph theory was tested on simple atomic model systems  @xcite and small rigid molecules  @xcite .",
    "however , liquids that have been shown to obey power - law density scaling are usually organic liquids with often internal degrees of freedom . in particular , many polymeric liquids obey power - law density scaling .",
    "this led us to investigate the applicability of the isomorph theory to flexible chain molecules in our previous publication ( paper i )  @xcite .",
    "we showed that the isomorph theory describes the properties of the flexible lennard - jones chains very well , except for small deviations due to intramolecular effects .",
    "these effects were due to the covalent bonds in the chain , which do not scale with density .    in paper  i  @xcite ,",
    "the covalent bonds were simulated using a constraint algorithm to keep the bond length fixed .",
    "this is not the most common way to simulate molecules with molecular dynamics  @xcite . in the field of ( bio)chemistry , for instance",
    ", coarse - grained and all - atom models generally have force fields that model covalent bonds as harmonic springs  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show that the bond type has large implications on the applicability of the isomorph theory .",
    "we show that the lennard - jones chains with harmonic bonds have curves in their phase diagram along which the dynamics and structure are invariant . using a method that is not dependent on the validity of the isomorph theory",
    ", we also generate curves of constant excess entropy ( configurational adiabats ) . we find that unlike isomorphs , curves of invariant dynamics do not coincide with the configurational adiabats .",
    "we propose the name `` _ _ pseudo__isomorphs '' for curves that have invariant dynamics and structure , but not constant excess entropy .",
    "our result has important consequences for the applicability of rosenfeld s excess - entropy scaling we find that this scaling does not work for lennard - jones chain liquids with harmonic bonds .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly review relevant aspects of the isomorph theory .",

    ", this should hold to a good approximation for all physically relevant configurations .    from this definition",
    "it follows that the structure of the liquid is invariant in reduced units at isomorphic state points , because the relative probabilities of configurations that are scaled versions of each other are the same at both state points .",
    "another important consequence of eq .",

    "one finds that the forces at two isomorphic state points are the same in reduced units , @xmath38 , for configurations obeying eq .",

    "it should also be noted that the isomorph theory was recently generalized by defining a roskilde - simple system by the property that the order of potential energies is maintained for uniform scaling of configurations : @xmath47  @xcite . for the properties considered in this paper",
    "the new formulation of the theory leads to the same predictions as the original formulation of the theory .",
    "we simulated the flexible lennard - jones chain ( ljc ) model in the liquid phase .",

    "the interaction between bonded particle pairs is modeled by a harmonic spring @xmath50 with spring constant @xmath51 .",
    "note the bond length is the same as the distance at which the lennard - jones energy is zero .",
    "the simulation time step was 0.0025 , which is sufficiently small for the large spring constant used .",
    "the simulations were carried out in the nvt ensemble , keeping the temperature fixed using a nos - hoover thermostat .",
    "the nos - hoover thermostat is known to not sample an harmonic potential correctly , but this does not affect the results for dense systems like the liquids studied here  @xcite .",
    "we employed a cubic bounding box with periodic boundary conditions containing @xmath52 particles ( 200 chains ) .",
    "the simulations were performed using the md code rumd  @xcite , which is optimized for gpu computing  @xcite . in some of the figures below we compare our results to simulations of the ljc with rigid bonds .",
    "most of the latter data come from paper i , in which the details of the simulation of the rigid - bond chains can be found  @xcite .",
    "the lennard - jones chain was first simulated by kremer and grest  @xcite , who used it as a coarse - grained model to study the properties of polymeric liquids .",
    "the particles in the chain correspond to groups of atoms , like one or several @xmath53 units in an alkane , or one or several monomers in a polymer . for this reason the lennard - jones particles in the chain",
    "are referred to as `` segments '' .",
    "starting at the end of the 90 s , extensive simulations of the model have been done to investigate the behavior of polymer melts around the glass transition  @xcite . at that time",
    "the model had already undergone some changes compared to the original version .",
    "the main difference was that the new simulations did not cut and shift the potential at the minimum , but also included the attractive part of the lennard - jones potential  @xcite , whereas the earlier versions cut and shifted the potential at the minimum .",
    "a second difference was that kremer and grest  @xcite did not use molecular dynamics , but langevin dynamics , which includes a stochastic force similar to what is done when simulating an implicit solvent  @xcite .    in the original version of the ljc model  @xcite , as well as in many later simulations where",
    "the attractive part of the lj potential is taken into account  @xcite , bonds were modeled with the following finitely extensible nonlinear elastic ( fene ) potential @xmath54\\,.\\ ] ] here , @xmath55 is the maximum length of the bond at which the potential diverges . since the fene potential is purely attractive , it is used in addition to the lennard - jones potential .",
    "this is in contrast to the harmonic - bond chains used in this work , where there is no lennard - jones interaction between bonded particles .",
    "the combination of the fene and the lennard - jones potentials results in a potential minimum of approximately @xmath56 .",
    "some more recent simulations of lennard - jones chains have used harmonic bonds  @xcite and rigid bonds  @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "the bond length is always set to @xmath57 for both the harmonic and the rigid bonds . in the case of harmonic springs ,",
    "the spring constant is always @xmath51 , which is rather stiff and leads to narrow bond length distributions .",
    "therefore the stiff harmonic bonds and rigid bonds are often considered to be equivalent , at least concerning the phase diagram of the ljc phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of the ljc model with fene bonds is not expected to be the same due to the different bond lengths .",
    "moreover , the shorter bond lengths will have a significant effect on the molecular structure .",
    "we therefore decided to investigate the effect of non - rigid bonds by comparing our previous results for rigid bonds  @xcite with new simulations of the ljc model with harmonic bonds .",
    "with @xmath58 of the segments and the center of mass , and the autocorrelation function of the end - to - end vector @xmath59 are plotted .",
    "( a ) at a standard density ( @xmath60 ) the harmonic and rigid bonds give practically the same dynamics , while the ljc model with fene bonds ( green dotted lines ) has faster dynamics due to the smaller bond length .",
    "( b ) at higher density and temperature , the chains with harmonic bonds have slightly faster dynamics than the chains with rigid bonds .",
    "the two state points in ( a ) and ( b ) are isomorphic to one another for the rigid - bond chains  @xcite . ]",
    "we compare the dynamics of the ljc models with different bond types in fig .",

    "figure  [ fig : dynamics - bonds](a ) shows the dynamics at a standard dense liquid state point .",
    "as mentioned earlier  @xcite , the harmonic and rigid bonds give indistinguishable dynamics at this state point .",
    "nevertheless , at another state point with higher density and temperature , the dynamics of the chains with harmonic and rigid bonds start to differ , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamics - bonds](b ) , so the two models with different bond types can not be considered to be equivalent for all state points .",
    "the two state points investigated in fig .  [ fig : dynamics - bonds](a ) and  ( b ) have been shown in paper i to be isomorphic to each other for the ljc liquid with rigid bonds , i.e. , they have to a very good approximation the same dynamics and ( intermolecular ) structure .",
    "we also showed there that the isomorph in the phase diagram was well described by the condition @xmath61 with @xmath62 determined by empirical scaling  @xcite .",
    "the fact that the ljc model with harmonic bonds does not have the same dynamics as the model with rigid bonds indicates one of two things : _ either _ the model with harmonic bonds conforms to the isomorph theory but with isomorphs described by a different @xmath5 , _ or _ the model with harmonic bonds does not conform to the isomorph theory .",
    "earlier it has been shown that the ljc liquid with harmonic bonds obeys power - law density scaling  @xcite , which is a good approximation to isomorphic scaling in small density ranges .",
    "moreover , the model has also been shown to obey rosenfeld s excess - entropy scaling  @xcite , which is in agreement with the isomorph theory .",
    "these facts indicate that the ljc liquid with harmonic bonds could be described by the isomorph theory , albeit with an @xmath5 that is slightly different from the rigid bond chains .",
    "as we shall see , this is not the case , although the model does have curves of invariant dynamics and structure .     and virial @xmath11 equilibrium fluctuations for the ljc model with different bond types .",
    "where the rigid bond simulations ( a ) have quite strong @xmath16 correlations , the use of harmonic bonds ( b ) destroys the correlations .",
    "the fene bonds ( c ) have a slightly higher correlation coefficient than the harmonic bonds .",
    "for all three bond types , the data were obtained at the state point @xmath63 , @xmath64 . ]",
    "so far it seems like the bond type only has a small effect on the behavior of the liquid .",
    "this is , however , not the case when looking at a prominent property of r liquids .",
    "figure  [ fig : fluctuations - bonds ] shows scatter plots of the fluctuations of the potential energy @xmath10 and the virial @xmath11 for the three different bond types .",
    "it is immediately apparent that the bond type has a big effect on the correlations of the these two quantities . for the rigid bonds it was already shown in paper i that the correlation coefficient of the ljc liquid is @xmath65 at the state point @xmath60 , @xmath66 .",
    "[ fig : fluctuations - bonds](b ) shows that if the same state point is simulated with harmonic bonds , the correlations disappear almost completely ( @xmath67 ) , even though the dynamics do not change ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamics - bonds](a ) ) .",
    "we also show data for the fene bonds in fig .  [",
    "fig : fluctuations - bonds](c ) . here",
    "the correlations are stronger ( @xmath68 ) than in the system with harmonic bonds , but still far from the value of the chains with rigid bonds .",
    "both the strong @xmath16 correlations and the existence of isomorphs in a liquid s phase diagram are properties of an r liquid , and it has been shown that @xmath16 correlations imply the existence of isomorphs and vice versa  @xcite . in view of this",
    "it is puzzling that earlier investigations of the model with harmonic bonds have shown that it obeys power - law density scaling  @xcite and rosenfeld s excess - entropy scaling  @xcite , indicating that it _ is _ a simple liquid , while the strong @xmath16 correlations are absent , indicating that it _ is not _ an r liquid .",
    "isomorphs are often created by keeping excess entropy constant ( sec .  [",
    "sec : theory ] ) , and we create a configurational adiabat using the same method . we circumvent the time - consuming calculation of the excess entropy by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma - rhot ] ) to keep @xmath34 constant ( without knowing its value ) .",
    "we do this by performing an initial equilibrium simulation at the state point @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath46 is then calculated from the fluctuations in @xmath10 and @xmath11 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma - fluctuations ] ) .",
    "note that this is possible even if the liquid does not obey the isomorph theory , and the fluctuations in @xmath10 and @xmath11 are not correlated  @xcite .",
    "we choose a density @xmath28 for the new state point , which is close to the density of the initial state point .",
    "it is then possible to calculate the temperature @xmath31 at this new density for which the excess entropy is identical to the first state point , by rewriting eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma - rhot ] ) to @xmath70 .",
    "the procedure is repeated several times by doing an equilibrium simulation at the new state point to calculate a new value of @xmath46 and find a new state point on the adiabat .",
    "it is important to choose the change in density @xmath71 small enough because @xmath46 may change with density .",
    "this can be verified by making sure that a further decrease of this density difference does not have a significant effect on the result . here , the change in density was 0.02 , and we obtained a set of state points with densities ranging from 0.96 to 1.08 .     and the autocorrelation of the end - to - end vector @xmath59 .",
    "the length of the scattering vector was kept constant in reduced units as @xmath72 with @xmath73 approximately at the main peak of the static structure factor .",
    "( c ) the autocorrelation functions of the first and the fifth rouse modes .",
    "all these dynamical quantities differ at the four state points , showing that for the ljc model with harmonic bonds , the dynamics are not a function of the excess entropy alone . ]    for r  liquids , a configurational adiabat is an isomorph , and therefore the dynamics are invariant along a configurational adiabat when plotted in reduced units .",
    "we test this in fig .",
    "[ fig : ljch_im4_dynamics ] where we plot various dynamical quantities of the harmonic bond ljc model for state points on the configurational adiabat .",
    "the figure contains ( a ) mean square displacements , ( b ) incoherent intermediate scattering functions @xmath74 and autocorrelation functions of the end - to - end vector @xmath59 , and ( c ) rouse - mode autocorrelation functions @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "all these quantities , which probe the segmental dynamics of the individual lj particles , as well as the chain dynamics , are clearly changing along the configurational adiabat .     along the configurational adiabat , in reduced units .",
    "we split the total ( segmental ) @xmath77 into ( a ) intermolecular contributions and ( b ) intramolecular contributions . for the intermolecular @xmath77",
    "there is a reasonable collapse , but for the intramolecular @xmath77 there are clear differences , especially around the bond length . ]",
    "the isomorph theory predicts that the structure of the liquid is invariant along a configurational adiabat . for completeness",
    "we also test this with the radial distribution functions plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ljch_im4_rdf ] .",
    "the radial distribution functions are split in the intermolecular contributions of particle pairs in different molecules and intramolecular contributions from pairs in the same molecule .",
    "the reason is that we have previously shown that only the intermolecular contribution is invariant on the isomorph for the ljc model with rigid bonds  @xcite . for the chains with harmonic bonds we find qualitatively the same results on the configurational adiabat ; the average bond length does not scale with density , and is therefore not invariant in reduced units .",
    "the intramolecular structure is thus not the same at different densities .",
    "the intermolecular structure is reasonably invariant , since the first peak is exactly at the same position for the tested densities .",
    "however , it should be noted the height of the first peak of @xmath78 changes more than what was found for the ljc with rigid bonds on the isomorph  @xcite .    from the results presented so far we conclude that the ljc model with harmonic bonds does not obey the isomorph theory or rosenfeld s excess - entropy scaling , because the dynamics are not invariant on a curve of constant excess entropy .",
    "this is in disagreement with previous results , that have shown that the ljc with flexible bonds does obey rosenfeld s excess - entropy scaling  @xcite .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is the way that the excess entropy is calculated .",
    "the excess entropy can been approximated in different ways , the most exact of which is thermodynamic integration .",

    "they found that the scaling works best when @xmath79 is used , ignoring the bonded particle pairs .",

    "the fact that at high temperatures the chains with harmonic bonds have faster dynamics than the chains with rigid bonds ( see fig .",

    "it seems that the effect of temperature is slightly larger for the harmonic bonds , which we attribute to the temperature dependence of the the bond length distributions .",
    "our analysis of the structure and dynamics shows that the ljc model with harmonic bonds has pseudoisomorphs , which are very similar to the isomorphs of the ljc model with rigid bonds .",
    "dynamics and structure are invariant on these curves , except when very local intramolecular contributions are considered , such as the higher rouse modes and the separation between nearest and next - nearest neighbors .",
    "the pseudoisomorphs of the chains with harmonic bonds have a different shape from the isomorphs of the chains with rigid bonds , especially at high densities and temperatures .",
    "this difference is presumably caused by the wider bond length distributions for flexible bonds at high temperatures .",
    "the main differences between the pseudoisomorphs in this paper and the isomorphs in paper  i are related to the fluctuations in the energy and the pressure .",
    "the @xmath16 correlations are weak , and @xmath46 as calculated from the @xmath16 fluctuations does not agree with the logarithmic slope of the pseudoisomorph in the @xmath105 phase diagram . therefore the excess entropy is not constant on the pseudoisomorph .",
    "the ljc liquid with harmonic bonds does thus not obey the isomorph theory , even though the same model with rigid bonds does and has similar dynamics and structure .",
    "this also means that the liquid with harmonic bonds does not obey rosenfeld s excess - entropy scaling when the bonds are flexible , i.e. , the excess entropy does not control the relaxation time .",
    "this is in disagreement earlier results , where the chains with harmonic bonds have been shown to obey rosenfeld s excess - entropy scaling  @xcite .",
    "the disagreement of these previous results with our conclusion may be ascribed to the fact that the collapse of the data was not exact in these previous studies .",

    "have shown that excess entropy scaling works best when the entropy is approximated by the pair entropy @xmath79 and the bonded particle pairs are ignored  @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the flexible bonds contribute to the entropy of the system , but this contribution is not related to the ( long - time ) dynamics of the system .",
