    "research on financial markets using methods and concepts developed in physics has increased considerably over the last decade .",
    "various kinds of stylized facts or empirical laws of markets have been discovered from high precision market data of gigantic size @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the next goal of this econophysics study is to attempt to establish the reasons for these empirical findings .",
    "just as with the boyle - charles macroscopic law which can be derived from a simple microscopic ideal - gas model , we hope to construct a simple microscopic model of a market that can reproduce major empirical findings . by relating macroscopic market behavior to microscopic dealers actions , we may find a pathway to control the markets , so as to avert bubbles and crashes , which occasionally cause problems in the market .",
    "the study of modeling dealers action is carried out with so - called agent - based models .",
    "this approach is supported not only by economists but also by information scientists and physicists @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "agent - based models can in practice reproduce dealers actions in the market and they can also reflect empirical laws of markets to some extent .",
    "however , agent models generally include a huge number of parameters , and it has proved difficult to understand the relation between the parameters of the model and resulting market behavior .    in order to find relationships between the parameters of dealers actions and market behavior , we have already introduced a kind of minimal model of an agent - based market which consists of dealers with simple deterministic time evolution rules @xcite@xcite@xcite . with this model , we successfully reproduced most of the basic empirical laws using a minimal number of parameters , and found that there are only three important effects needed to reproduce the empirical laws .",
    "the first effect is the compromise pricing of both buyers and sellers , who tend to allow the particular transaction price they have in mind to approach the current market price in order to make a deal . from this effect , transactions occur spontaneously in the market and the price rises and falls almost randomly .",
    "the second effect is the self - modulation of transaction intervals , that is , the rate of a dealer s clock depends on the latest moving average value of transaction intervals .",
    "when market activity becomes high , dealers accelerate their transaction rates , and by this effect we can reproduce empirical statistical properties of transaction intervals which deviate from a simple poisson process .",
    "the third is the trend - follow effect , that is , dealers forecast upcoming prices using the latest market trend which is defined by a moving average of price changes . this forecasting effect makes the price change distribution follow a power law quite similar to that of the real market .    in this paper",
    "we first introduce a stochastic version of the dealer model which is even simpler than the above ( deterministic ) model . in the case of the deterministic dealer model we needed at least three dealers to reproduce market properties ; however , in the present stochastic model we require only two .",
    "the advantages of this stochastic model are not only its simplicity but also its solvability by analytical calculation . in the usual agent - based approaches intensive numerical simulation is the only way to obtain results ; in such cases exact or strict results are rarely obtained .",
    "based on this stochastic dealer model and its variants we can derive the major empirical results mentioned above , that have already been obtained by simulation of the deterministic dealer model by theoretical analysis .    apart from agent - based modeling , the standard way to model markets is by utilizing random walks .",
    "it is now widely known that bachelier introduced a random walk model for market prices five years earlier than einstein s random walk model of brownian motion@xcite@xcite .",
    "work on portfolio theory , option price formulation@xcite and the arch and garch models@xcite@xcite , which has led to nobel prizes for their developers , are all based on random walk models .    recently , one of the authors ( m.t . )",
    "has introduced a new type of extended random walk model of the market , the so - called puck model , in which a random walker moves according to a deforming potential force , the center point of which is given by the moving average of the random walker s traces . by using this generalization ,",
    "all major empirical laws can be established ; moreover , dynamical behaviors such as bubbles , crashes and inflations can also be described as following from special cases of the market potential force@xcite@xcite .",
    "the arch model can also be derived as a special limiting case of this extended random walk model@xcite .",
    "considering the wide applicability of the puck model has led to an open question concerning the origin of market potential forces .",
    "this question has been partially answered by using the deterministic dealer model @xcite . here , we are able to provide quantitative answers by using the stochastic dealer model .    in the next section",
    "we introduce our stochastic dealer models step by step in sequential subsections .",
    "the third section is devoted to the relationship with the puck model , in which we will see how dealers actions produce a market s potential force in a quantitative discussion .",
    "the final section contains a summary .",
    "in this section we introduce three stochastic dealer models , model-1 , model-2 and model-3 .",
    "model-1 is the simplest market model in which the framework of the stochastic dealer model is introduced .",
    "then , we note two empirical properties which model-1 can not reflect . in model-2 and model-3",
    "we introduce two additional effects respectively to deal with these difficulties . after combining these revisions , the stochastic dealer model fully reflects all major empirical laws of markets .",
    "firstly , we assume an artificial market consisting of only two dealers who are offering both buying and selling prices .",
    "the buying price , or bid price , is the current maximum price at which the dealer wants to buy . the selling price , or ask price , is the minimum price at which he will sell . for each dealer",
    "the ask price is always higher than the bid price , because they want some margin , and the difference between these prices is called the spread , which is assumed to be a constant , @xmath0 , in this model .",
    "we define the @xmath1-th dealer s mid - price at time @xmath2 , @xmath3 , as the average of his bid and ask prices .",
    "when @xmath4 is less than @xmath0 , these dealers do not transact as their transaction conditions are not fulfilled ( fig.[fig : transaction2.eps]a ) .",
    "in such a case dealers are assumed to change their prices randomly according to the following rule .",
    "@xmath5 here , @xmath6 is a random noise for the @xmath1-th dealer , and @xmath7 is a constant parameter .",
    "then , the distance between @xmath8 and @xmath9 is checked .",
    "if it is greater than or equal to @xmath0 , then one dealer s bid price is higher than the other s ask price , and a transaction occurs ( fig.[fig : transaction2.eps]c ) . in such a case a unit volume deal is assumed to be made , with the market price given by the averaged price of the two dealers mid - prices .",
    "after this transaction their mid - prices are assumed to shift to the market price .",
    "these processes are repeated again and again and the time proceeds in unit of @xmath10 .",
    "it should be noted that there is a possibility that this model produces a negative value for market price .",
    "in such a case the step width of the price change , @xmath11 , should depend on the market price , such that the value of @xmath11 is proportional to the market price to avoid crossing the origin . here , we pay attention only to the case that the price fluctuation level is much smaller than the market price and for simplicity , we assume that @xmath11 is constant .",
    "-th dealer s mid - price is denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "( a ) : in this situation no transaction occurs .",
    "( b ) : the dealers prices follow random walks .",
    "( c ) : when the distance between @xmath8 and @xmath9 is greater than or equal to @xmath0 , a transaction occurs and the market price is defined by the averaged price of the two mid - prices .",
    "( d ) : after this transaction both dealers mid - prices move to the market price .",
    "these processes are repeated .",
    ", width=302 ]    for convenience of analysis we define another unit of time called the tick time , denoted by @xmath12 , which takes an integer value incremented at each occurrence of a transaction .",
    "accordingly , @xmath13 denotes the market price at tick time @xmath12 , and the @xmath12-th transaction interval , @xmath14 , is defined by the time difference between the @xmath15-th and @xmath12-th transactions .    in fig.[fig :",
    "ts - pi ] , we plot an example of resulting market prices and corresponding transaction intervals . in the sub - windows of these figures",
    "we also plot the probability density function of price changes @xmath16 and transaction intervals @xmath14 both on a semi - log scale .",
    "it is clear that the tail parts of both of these distributions are well characterized by exponential laws . as for the intervals",
    ", this result implies that the occurrence of transactions of this model is approximated by a poisson process .",
    "it is interesting that the price change distribution of this simplest model follows an exponential distribution except around @xmath17 , instead of gaussian distribution .",
    ", @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    we can explain the functional form of the tails of these distributions as follows .",
    "we define the difference of the dealers prices by @xmath21 , then the condition for the occurrence of a transaction is given by @xmath22 , and we also define the mass center by the average of the two mid - prices , @xmath23 . as the mass center at the time of transaction gives the market price ,",
    "market price statistics can be calculated from the information about @xmath24 for times @xmath22 .",
    "namely , @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 which is defined by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the previous transaction time .",
    "these two variables define a two dimensional random walk with absorbing walls at @xmath29 and @xmath30 as shown in fig.[fig : footprint_d - dg_model-1.eps ] .",
    "the stochastic dynamics is described by the following set of equations ( [ eq:2d - brownian_m1 ] ) .",
    "[ eq:2d - brownian_m1 ] @xmath31 @xmath32    when the random walker reaches one of the absorbing walls a transaction occurs , and by the transaction rule of model-1 that the prices of the two dealers are then set to the market price , the random walker goes to the origin , and a new random walk begins .",
    "in this 2-dimensional formulation the transaction interval , @xmath14 , is given by the survival time , that is , the time the random walker starting from the origin takes to reach one of the absorbing walls .",
    "similarly , the market price change , @xmath33 , is given by the random walker s location on the @xmath34 axis .",
    "the particle starts from the origin and continues a random walk until it touches one of the horizontal walls , meaning that a market transaction occurs .",
    "the transaction interval is given by the survival time of this random walker , and the market price change @xmath25 is given by the distance along the @xmath26 axis from the origin to the position of the particle on the absorbing wall . , width=302 ]    in fig.3 an example of a random walk is shown for better understanding of this mapping of model-1 to a 2-dimensional random walk . here ,",
    "the horizontal axis is the @xmath35-axis and the vertical one is the @xmath36-axis . for theoretical analysis",
    "we consider a continuum limit such that the mesh sizes of space and time go to zero . under the condition @xmath37",
    ", we find that the probability density @xmath38 of the particle in the @xmath39 plane at time @xmath2 is described by the following diffusion equation .",
    "@xmath40 @xmath41 here , @xmath42 is equivalent to the diffusion coefficient of this 2-dimensional random walk .",
    "the initial condition is the delta function , and the boundary condition is given by the absorbing walls on the @xmath36 axis , while there is no boundary in the @xmath35 direction .",
    "this diffusion equation is solved exactly as follows , @xmath43 here , @xmath44 .",

    "so , the functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 can be approximated as    [ allequations ] @xmath51    from these results we can derive the exponential laws of interval distributions and the price change distributions already seen in fig.[fig : ts - pi ] .",
    "it is confirmed that the theoretical values of the decay constants @xmath52 and @xmath53 , fit well with the numerical results .",

    "@xmath64 is catalan s constant ; @xmath65 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in this subsection we focus on the statistical differences between transaction intervals of real markets and those of model-1 . in real dollar - yen exchange market data provided by ebs for six years from 2000 to 2005 , we find that the transaction intervals exhibit a circadian pattern even for foreign exchange markets which are open continuously as shown in fig.[fig : avent_15min_ydt_00 - 05.eps ] for the dollar - yen market .",
    "as can be clearly seen , large numbers of transactions occur during office hours of tokyo , london and new york and the transaction density is least a little before the open of the tokyo offices .",
    "in addition to this 24-hour pattern , there are fluctuations with much shorter time scales as typically shown in fig.[fig : price_20050616_2.eps ] . in this figure transaction events",
    "are shown by bars at the top and corresponding dollar - yen rates are plotted in the lower section . here",
    "the window size is ten minutes and we can find places where bars tend to cluster , marked as `` dense '' , and others where bars are `` sparse '' .",
    "the distribution of these intervals is clearly seen not to correspond to the simple theoretical model of a poisson process .",
    "the clustering properties of transactions are known to be well modeled by a self - modulation process introduced by the authors @xcite , which is described as follows .",
    "@xmath66 where @xmath67 is the time scale of self - modulation , and @xmath68 @xmath69 and @xmath70 are independent noises , and @xmath71 is the number of transactions occurring within @xmath67 seconds .",
    "this process is a modified poisson process whose mean value is given by the moving average of transaction intervals over the past @xmath67 seconds .",
    "as a result , there is a greater tendency to cluster and the so - called 1/f fluctuation is realized in general .",
    "model-2 is designed to satisfy the real interval property by applying the self - modulation process .",
    "we estimate the distribution of @xmath69 from real data by using the following relation for the transaction intervals , @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath72    here the typical value of @xmath67 is 150 seconds .",
    "it is confirmed from dollar - yen rate data that the distribution of @xmath69 follows an exponential distribution in general with mean value of unity .",
    "this exponential distribution is favorable for our model construction as model-1 automatically produces the exponential interval distribution . as we can control the speed of transaction intervals by controlling the speed of diffusion , we obtain a revised model , model-2 , by modifying the constant parameter @xmath7 in eq.([eq : model-1 ] ) , which is directly related to the diffusion coefficient , making it a time - dependent parameter @xmath73 as follows .",

    "it is apparent that the market potential function and the dealers forecasting effect are also deeply related in this stochastic model .",
    "the puck model is formulated as follows : @xmath120 here @xmath13 is the noise reduction price introduced by ohnisi et .",

    "we note that eq.([eq : dp - model3 ] ) in model-3 and eq.([eq : pm-2 ] ) have the same form of a linear stochastic equation , so the statistical property is independent of the noise property . comparing the coefficients of @xmath130 in eq.([eq : dp - model3 ] ) and eq.([eq : pm-2 ] )",
    ", we have the simple relation : @xmath132 by taking the average over tick times @xmath12 , we have @xmath133 where @xmath134 denotes the average of @xmath35 over tick time @xmath12 .",
    "this equation implies that the market is unstable ( @xmath135 ) when dealers are trend followers ( @xmath136 ) while the market is stable when dealers are contrarians ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "this result is consistent with our previous simulation results using the deterministic dealer model .    in the puck model , when the potential is of quadratic type such as in fig.[fig : potential_model3.eps]abc , the diffusion coefficient of market prices , @xmath138 , is theoretically calculated as a function of the potential coefficient @xmath139@xcite . by introducing the newly derived relation , eq.([eq : sigma - b ] ) , into the formula , we have a theoretical evaluation of the price diffusion coefficient for our model-3 .",
    "@xmath140 from this relation we find that in the range of @xmath141 the value of @xmath138 is finite , and we can expect the market price to follow a normal random walk over a long time scale .",
    "when @xmath142 the above formula is meaningless ; however , the actual market price moves nearly monotonically or even exponentially as occurs for bubbles in real markets .",
    "actually we can generate a bubble - like phenomenon by setting @xmath142 as shown in fig.[fig : bubble_yahoo.eps ] . here , the time evolution is well approximated by an exponential function as predicted by the puck model@xcite .",
    "we do not investigate this phenomenon further in this paper , but it should be stressed that our model can describe not only normal states of markets , but also abnormal states such as bubbles and crashes where prices move monotonically , by tuning our model s parameters .",
    "we have introduced a new stochastic dealer model which consists of only two dealers , and showed that basic empirical laws of financial markets are well reflected in terms of transaction intervals and price changes . in model-1 ,",
    "both dealers change their prices randomly , so fluctuations of transaction intervals and price changes are also random .",
    "we calculated these statistical properties exactly .",
    "the occurrence of transactions is well approximated by a poisson process , and the price change distribution is well described by an exponential distribution .    in order to make our model more realistic the following two feedback effects were introduced .",
    "one was the feedback effect of transaction intervals , and the other was the feedback effect of price changes , both caused by the dealers observations of the latest market status .",
    "as a result , the basic model s random noise properties were modulated and the artificial market reproduced both the distributions of transaction intervals and price changes to follow long - tailed distributions which are quite similar to those of real markets .    moreover , we established that the dealers action of prediction by using a moving average of past price changes generates market potentials in the puck formulation , and we derived a simple theoretical relation between the stochastic dealer model and the puck model .",
    "namely , we found the relation between the microscopic dealers strategy and the macroscopic market s stability as defined by the puck model .",
    "as an application of the relation to the puck model , we checked the condition when market prices in our stochastic dealer model exhibit a bubble - like phenomenon in which price motion is approximated by an exponential function rather than a random walk .",
    "this transition from a random walk phase to an exponential growth phase is considered to be quite useful for discussions concerning how to realize a stable market .",
    "we expect that our models can be used as a base for market experiments .",
    "for example , we may be able to observe the effect of governmental intervention by introducing a third dealer who only buys dollars over a given period . from the viewpoint of numerical simulation",
    "it is quite easy to increase the number of dealers , each of whom will have his own strategy .",
    "so we can construct any experimental market by adding or subtracting specific dealers , and observe the change in the market s macroscopic behavior as a result .",
    "for example , we may be able to find a way to avoid market crashes by introducing a specially designed dealer who acts to stabilize the market .",
    "this kind of market experiment may contribute to future attempts at real market stabilization .",

    "<S> we introduce solvable stochastic dealer models , which can reproduce basic empirical laws of financial markets such as the power law of price change . starting from the simplest model that is almost equivalent to a poisson random noise generator , </S>",
    "<S> the model becomes fairly realistic by adding only two effects , the self - modulation of transaction intervals and a forecasting tendency , which uses a moving average of the latest market price changes . </S>",
    "<S> based on the present microscopic model of markets , we find a quantitative relation with market potential forces , which has recently been discovered in the study of market price modeling based on random walks . </S>"
