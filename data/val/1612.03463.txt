    "the xx0 model has diverse relations with many topics in statistical and high energy physics , and mathematical physics .",
    "these topics include combinatorial and probabilistic models such as alternating sign matrices , random tilings , theory of random walks in lattice and random matrix theory , plane partitions and theory of symmetric functions , , and also topological string theory .    random matrix theory from its first appearance in 1930 s , has been used in different branches of mathematics and physics . in mathematical physics , it has been mainly employed in statistical mechanics and quantum field theories to calculate the correlation functions of systems with complicated interactions .",
    "these techniques have been expanded , refined and enriched in various different problems from high energy physics such as yang - mill theory , and quantum gravity to statistical physics such as diffusion process , nibm , traffic and communication network , and stock movements in financial markets , , etc . in this section",
    "we will apply this technique to tackle the correlation functions of xx0 model .",
    "let us start with the most general finite size , xyz heisenberg spin chain with the following hamiltonian , @xmath3 where @xmath4 are the pauli matrices , @xmath5 @xmath6 are the couplings and @xmath7 is the external magnetic field . in this study",
    "we focus on the isotropic and periodic heisenberg spin chain of finite size @xmath8 with @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which is called xx0 spin chain with the following hamiltonian , @xmath12 where raising and lowering spin operators are defined by @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the nearest neighbour coupling constant , satisfying the periodic boundary condition , @xmath15    recently , considerable studies have been devoted to different aspects of the xx0 model as an integrable model .",
    "this includes the study of time - dependent ( thermal ) correlation functions of xx0 model .",
    "the correlation functions of xx0 model as a special case of xy model , at zero temperature are studied in , , . at nonzero temperature , by using the similarities to the gas of bosons on a line , the correlation functions of xx0 model are investigated in , , , , , , and the equal time correlation function was obtained in , . furthermore , time - dependent correlation function is obtained in using the fredholm determinant of a linear integral operator .",
    "the correlation functions of xxz and xx0 models in thermodynamic limit are studied in , , , , . using similarities between xx0 model and nibm , correlation functions of xx0 model in low temperature limit",
    "are recently formulated and investigated by bogoliubov , , , .    as we mentioned before and",
    "also summarized in appendix d , different nonzero thermal correlation functions in the xx0 spin chain can be defined and studied , using the combinatorial features of the xx0 model .",
    "these correlation functions are basically made by spin averages over the product of spin operators acting on the ferromagnetic vacuum .",
    "we can rewrite the correlation functions by first acting the spin operators on the ferromagnetic vacuum and obtaining a new states and then the correlation functions can be written as the spin average over the time evolution operator between the new states . in this study , first we fix the initial and final spin state . in other words , we consider a specific arrangement of the spin operators which leave us with a particular state , a set of @xmath16 neighboring spin - down states , located on a finite segment of ferromagnetic vacuum with length _",
    "n_. this defines a correlation function , which for reasons that will be mentioned we call it the partition function from now on .",
    "thus , the partition function is defined as @xmath17 where the ferromagnetic vacuum , the state of all the spins up , is defined as @xmath18 , and _",
    "n _ , _ @xmath16 _ and _ t _ are size of the spin chain , size of spin - down segment i.e. number of the flipped spins ( in the literature , , this is often called @xmath19 @xmath20 ) and evolutionary parameter or time , respectively .",
    "it is natural to interpret the time as inverse temperature in the context of the statistical mechanics .",
    "there are technical reasons for choosing this special correlation function .",
    "this correlation function is basically the simplest possible correlation function from the mathematical point of view .",
    "in fact , as we discussed in appendix d , with this arrangement of spin operators , the schur functiona , which appear in the matrix integral form of the correlation function , are equal to identity and thus the correlation function takes the simple form of the gross - witten matrix integral . taking this into account and also considering the fact that @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , we call the correlation function [ delta eq7 ] , the partition function of xx0 model . from physical point of view , the prepared state with above arrangement of spin - downs has maximum energy in comparison with other states with equal number of magnons .",
    "the time evolution operator acts on this state and push the magnons to diffuse into the vacuum and reduce the energy . as we will explain in sec . 4 , there will be different situations regarding to the distribution of magnons and this determines the phase structure of the model .",
    "as we mentioned , the correlation functions of xx0 in the thermodynamic limit have been studied before .",
    "our main goal in this study is to find the analytic expression for the above partition function ( [ delta eq7 ] ) in the asymptotic limit ; the limit of large @xmath23 , @xmath8 and @xmath19 .",
    "as we will observe , the result of asymptotic analysis of the partition function depends explicitly on the relations between the parameters or technically the moduli space of the parameters .",
    "our strategy toward the calculations of above partition function is first to use the matrix integral representation of the correlation functions and second to apply the results from nibm , which is obtained in terms of the matrix integrals and toeplitz determinants .",
    "the relation between xx0 model and nibm is studied comprehensively by bogoliubov and it has been used to derive the thermal correlation functions .",
    "this relation is at the heart of this study and thus let us summarize the key points of this connection .",
    "a remarkable property of the xx0 model is that the hamiltonian of the model generates the dynamics of the one - dimensional vicious random walks .",
    "in fact , the transition between up and down spin at the sites of the xx0 spin chain can be considered as a random move of random walkers in an one - dimensional vicious random walks model , see appendix a. moreover , generating function for the vicious random walks can be constructed from the correlation functions of the spin operators in the ferromagnetic vacuum state of the xx0 model in a zero magnetic field .",
    "another remarkable feature of the xx0 model is that the the correlations functions , made out of the many particle states , have definite combinatorial features and in fact can be written as matrix integrals with schur symmetric functions playing the role of spin operators .",
    "these properties and their consequences provide a feasible approach toward first , the understanding of a simple combinatorial and stochastic picture for the dynamics of the xx0 model and second , an explicit calculation of the correlation functions in the regime of finite parameters and also in the asymptotic limit .      in this part",
    ", we explain the matrix integral and toeplitz / hankel determinant representation of the partition function of finite and infinite xx0 spin chains . in this way ,",
    "first , following , we explain a result , indicating that the partition function of infinite xx0 spin chain can be represented by matrix integral with an specific weight function .",
    "then we deduce the representation of the finite xx0 model as a discrete version of the matrix integral .",
    "more explanations on this matter are reviewed in appendix d. finally , by using heine - szeg identity we express the partition function of xx0 model in terms of the toeplitz and hankel determinants .",
    "the random matrix theory , the theory of finite / infinite matrices with gaussian independently distributed random entries , is a powerful method for studying variety of physical systems and mathematical models . the main theme of applications of the random matrix theory in physics is emerged from the fact that the partition function of a two - dimensional gas of charged particles , interacting with a two dimensional coulomb force and an external potential , can be extracted by a matrix integral , i.e. integration over all the eigenvalues of a random matrix in random gaussian ensembles . in the context of our study ,",
    "the random matrix theory is used to extract the partition function of the xx0 spin chain .",
    "using the connections with nibm , bogoliubov derived the time dependent ( thermal ) correlation functions of the infinitely large size xx0 model , which we call it infinite xx0 model , in terms of a continuous matrix integral with gross - witten potential over the schur functions , see appendix [ pfcf ] . as it has been argued above and in appendix [ pfcf ] , the partition function of the infinite xx0 model , eq .",
    "[ delta eq7 ] , for @xmath24 , is an special case ( with the schur functions equal to identity ) of the matrix integral formula eq .",
    "[ cm ] for the correlation functions eq .",
    "[ c ] , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the weight function of the gross - witten potential @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is eigenvalue value of random matrix ) . notice that this matrix model has dimension @xmath16 and _ t _ is the parameter in the weight function .",
    "this matrix model has been studied in two - dimensional lattice gauge theories , called gross - witten ( gw ) model . from now on , for more convenience",
    "we rename @xmath30 by @xmath31",
    ".    it would be natural to think that the partition function of finite size xx0 model can be written as a discretization of the above matrix integral ( [ matrix continous ] ) as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a finite domain , a discrete subset of @xmath34 with size @xmath35 .",
    "the gross - witten matrix integral ( [ matrix continous ] ) can be expanded for small values of the eigenvalues around @xmath36 and the leading matrix integral , at @xmath37 , become a gaussian matrix integral with a quadratic potential @xmath38 , as follow @xmath39 similar to eq .",
    "[ matrix discrete ] , the discrete version of the above matrix integral ( [ gauss mi ] ) can be written easily . later",
    "we will discuss the importance and implication of the gaussian matrix integral in the asymptotic limit of the correlation functions in xx0 model .",
    "in fact , we will find that a partition function for the xx0 model with weakly coupled ( @xmath40 ) hamiltonian is equal to the gaussian matrix integral .",
    "using the heine - szeg identity , which identifies the matrix integrals with toeplitz and hankel determinants , we can replace the partition functions of infinite and finite size xx0 models , represented as continuous and discrete matrix integrals eqs .",
    "4 - 6 , with the continuous and discrete toeplitz eq .",
    "[ teoplitz ] , and hankel determinants eq .",
    "[ hankel ] , as follow @xmath41 and @xmath42    the reviewed results in this section are the key steps toward the explicit calculations of the partition functions and free energy of the ( in)finite xx0 spin chain .",
    "as we will observe in the following section , the explicit form of free energy will be used to extract the phase transitions in the model and also to interpret the physical meaning of the different domains in the phase structure .",
    "in fact , we will use the recent results in nibm in a twofold way .",
    "first , we use the correspondence between dynamics of magnons in the ferromagnetic vacuum and the motion of nonintersecting walkers in the nibm .",
    "this correspondence pave the way to prove that the partition function of xx0 model can be written as partition function ( toeplitz / hankel determinants ) of a nibm .",
    "second , we use exact results for the probability of the width of random walkers in the nibm which is expressed in terms of the toeplitz and hankel determinants .",
    "the distribution of this width is the tracy - widom function which has different trends in its tails .",
    "this difference is the origin of phase transitions in the xx0 model .",
    "in this section , our goal is to find explicit expression for the free energy of xx0 model which determines phase structure of the model . later , by using the exact correspondence between nibm and xx0 model , we interpret the obtained results .",
    "let us quickly overview the important methods and new results of this study .",
    "our main strategy to obtain the free energy and phase structure of xx0 model is first to use the matrix integral representation of the xx0 partition function and second to apply the exact results of nibm , to xx0 model by using the connections between xx0 model and nibm . in precise words , by using the two main results from , , reviewed in previous chapter and in appendix c , we obtain that ratio of partition function of finite and infinite xx0 model , in the asymptotic limit , is given by the tracy - widom distribution function .",
    "a careful asymptotic analysis of this result gives us an explicit formula for free energy of finite xx0 model , in different regions of the moduli space .",
    "based on this , we extract the new phase diagram of the xx0 model , which indicates the existence of second- and third - order phase transitions in xx0 model .",
    "finally , we provide a possible interpretation for the new phase structure of the model by assigning a quantum state to each region in the phase diagram .    in order to carefully translate the results from nibm to xx0 model",
    "we use a dictionary , that relates the parameters of two models . in this study , following , and as we mentioned before , _",

    "n _ , _ @xmath16 _ and _ t _ are the indicator of the discrete structure , the rank of the random matrix and a parameter in the weight function , respectively .",
    "now , we can explain the fundamental result of this study .",
    "we adopt a procedure to determine the asymptotic free energy of the finite xx0 model .",
    "in fact , instead of performing a direct asymptotic analysis of discrete and continuous partition functions , i.e. the discrete and continuous toeplitz and hankel determinants , we use the obtained results for the ratio of discrete and continuous determinants in terms of probability distributions in the context of nibm .",
    "this approach has been also used in the context of chern - simons theory . in other words",

    "[ teoplitz z ] and eq .  [ hankle z ] , and second we obtain the asymptotic of the discrete and continuous toeplitz / hankel determinants from the asymptotic of the probability distributions of the width in nibm .",

[ hankel con prob1 ] and [ hankel con prob2 ] for @xmath44 and @xmath45 , we obtain that the ratio of toeplitz / hankel determinants in the asymptotic limit is the tracy - widom distribution and thus one can easily obtain @xmath46 where @xmath47 is tracy - widom distribution function ( see appendix b ) , and in the case of gross - witten potential , @xmath48 and @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 defined by @xmath52 and for the quadratic potential , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "[ free enrgy1 ] , [ free enrgy2 ] and [ g free enrgy2 ] , the asymptotic limit of the free energy of finite xx0 model in some regions of the moduli space ( upper conditions in those equations ) is given by that of the infinite model and thus we can claim that in these regions of the moduli space the effect of size is washed out in the asymptotic limit and this limit is the continuum limit and hence the model becomes real infinite ( continuous ) model with no size effect . on the other hand , in other regions of the moduli space ( lower conditions in eqs .",
    "[ free enrgy1 ] ,  [ free enrgy2 ] and [ g free enrgy2 ] ) , although the system is in the asymptotic limit and the size of the system is moderately large , but since the asymptotic limit of the free energy of finite model , in addition to the free energy of the infinite model , has an extra term , the system still shows the effects of size .",

[ n_tau ] .    before explaining each of the above phase transitions , we should mention the following important points .",
    "in fact , all the interpretations in this section should be understood in the light of the following points :    * all the reasoning in the interpretation of the results are based on a simple fact , which is the correspondence between : i ) @xmath19 magnons and @xmath19 nonintersecting random walkers , and ii ) diffusion dynamics of the magnons in the ferromagnetic vacuum of spin chain and the nonintersecting brownian motion of the random walkers in a fixed domain .",
    "* based on dynamics of the nibm and its translation in terms of the diffusion of magnons into the ferromagnetic vacuum , we will associate a quantum state , i.e. a configuration of spins in each region of the phase diagram which demonstrates an equilibrium state obtained from the time evolution of the initial quantum state , used in eq . [ delta eq7 ] , in the asymptotic limit .",
    "in fact , these configuration are different distributions for positions of the magnons in the ferromagnetic vacuum , in the different regions of the phase diagram .",
    "the quantum state of each phase reflects the qualitative feature of that phase .",
    "furthermore , the quantum state is in equilibrium , regardless of the local movement of magnons in the vacuum which is a dynamical process . * in this study , all the phase transitions in xx0 model take place in the asymptotic limit , @xmath122 , and they are resulted from the competition of these parameters or the dimensionless rescaled parameters @xmath79 and @xmath73 .      first , we interpret the gross - witten phase transition and its implications for xx0 model .",
    "the free energy of the infinite xx0 spin chain , eq .",
    "[ gw pht ] , determines a third - order phase transition , separating region ii and iv in @xmath123 phase diagram at @xmath124 as shown in fig .",
    "[ n_tau ] . in order to explain this phase transition , we focus on the dynamical process of the diffusion of magnons in the ferromagnetic vacuum . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] and explained in appendix a , the diffusion of magnons into the ferromagnetic vacuum is entirely equivalent to the dynamical process of random vicious walkers in nibm .",
    "let us start with a collection of @xmath19 neighbouring magnons , located in an arbitrary interval in an infinitely large ferromagnetic vacuum , as shown in the fig .",
    "notice that , for more clarity we considered a symmetric quantum state which is different from the initial quantum state in eq .",
    "[ delta eq7 ] . in this section ,",
    "we study the time evolution of the symmetric quantum state .",
    "the diffusion of magnons into the vacuum starts at @xmath125 , and take place one spin after the other in each step of time . at the beginning of time , there are @xmath16 neighboring magnons , called _ localized ( freezed ) block of magnons _ with size @xmath19 . as the system evolves with time ,",
    "those magnons which are located at the edge of the localized block start to detach from the block and diffuse to the ferromagnetic vacuum , similar to random vicious walkers in nibm . as a result ,",
    "size of the magnon block shrinks with time .",
    "since at any step of time the foremost magnons at the two ends of block have a chance to detach from the block , thus at time @xmath23 , length of the magnon block with no chance to diffuse is @xmath126 .",
    "the process of detaching of magnons from the block would end when @xmath127 , once all of @xmath19 magnons have the chance to diffuse and the magnon block would disappear .    as we will see now ,",
    "the above explanation of the dynamics becomes more accurate in the limit of the large parameters , @xmath128 and we can explain the phases with more certainty . now consider the asymptotic limit , according to eq .  [ gw pht ] , depending on the ratio @xmath129 , be smaller or bigger than one , the system asymptotes to two different quantum states . as a matter of fact , the domain wall , @xmath60 , separates the phase diagram into two phases , @xmath130 and @xmath91 , with different free energy . in @xmath130 phase , there is a localized block of magnons with non - zero size and the remaining magnons in this block has no chance to diffuse in the vacuum and thus the xx0 spin chain has a long range order in this phase .",
    "in fact , this localized block of magnons phase has been already noticed in the context of nibm , in which a part of vicious walkers path is frozen in @xmath131 phase , see figure 2 in .",
    "however , in @xmath132 phase , all the magnons diffuse into the vacuum and thus there is no localized block of magnons .",
    "equivalently , the xx0 spin chain in this phase has no long range order .      having examined and interpreted the gross - witten phase transition in infinite xx0 spin chain , now we focus on studying and interpreting the complete phase structure of finite xx0 model , fig .",
    "[ n_tau ] .",
    "the finite xx0 model in the asymptotic limit contains the gross - witten phase transition as well as other phase transitions . in the same spirit as previous part",
    ", the interpretation of the new phase transitions is based on the diffusion of magnons in the ferromagnetic vacuum and the propagation of the corresponding vicious random walkers . here , the difference with the previous part is that the xx0 model has the size parameter @xmath8 which plays a crucial role along the effects of the other parameters , in the asymptotic limit .",
    "thus , as we also mentioned in the beginning of this chapter , the main difference between the asymptotic limit of the finite xx0 model and the infinite model is that in the asymptotic limit , the finite system bifurcates into two chambers of the moduli space with respect to the behavior of the parameter @xmath8 .",
    "one is with real infinitely large size xx0 model with no size effect and the other one is with moderately large size xx0 model but still with non - negligible finite size effect .    from a mathematical point of view , the diffusion of the magnons into the vacuum is equivalent to the propagation of vicious walkers in a fixed domain and thus we can study the size effects in the process of magnon diffusion by investigating the probability distribution of the width of the nibm in a finite domain , see appendix [ mig ] . the size effect in the asymptotic limit of the spin chain",
    "is reflected in the dynamics of the magnons and , as we will explain more in this section , we can interpret the effect of size by the event that at least a diffusing magnon ( the first magnon in the initial block of magnons next to the vacuum ) in the vacuum of the strongly coupled xx0 model reaches to the boundary of the spin chain , in the asymptotic limit . in nibm , this is equivalent to the event that the width @xmath133 of the nibm becomes equal or greater than the size of the domain , @xmath8 .",
    "let us denote the first magnon in the block of magnons by @xmath134 and the boundary of the spin chain by @xmath135 , and define @xmath136 as an event that the first magnon reaches to the boundary of the spin chain .",
    "then by using the fact that the dynamics of the magnons in the spin chain is equivalent to that of the vicious walkers in nibm , we can write @xmath137 and thus by using eqs . [ con prob1 ] and [ con prob2 ] in [ mig ] , we obtain @xmath138 where @xmath8 is the size of the spin chain . then , by using the asymptotic of the tracy - widom distribution , eq",
    ". [ domain wall ] , we obtain the leading order probability that a magnon reaches to the boundary , @xmath139 this result determines that , in each region of the moduli space of the parameters , whether a diffusing magnon into the vacuum of strongly coupled xx0 model reaches to the boundary of the spin chain ( thus we have a finite size effect ) or not .",
    "one of our goal in this section is to find an interpretation based on the dynamics of the magnons , for the extra term in the asymptotic limit of the free energy of the finite xx0 model in comparison to that of the infinite xx0 model ( compare second lines to first lines in eq .",
    "[ free enrgy1 ] and eq .",
    "[ free enrgy2 ] ) .",
    "as we briefly mentioned , to interpret the ( non)existence of the finite size effects in terms of the dynamics of magnons , it would be natural to think that in the ( in)finite xx0 model the diffusing magnons do ( not ) reach to the borders of the chain .",
    "in other words , the conditions of the model in the asymptotic limit and the competition between scaled time and scaled size , which is given by the relations between the parameters of the model ( in the first and second lines of the eq .  [ free enrgy1 ] and eq .",
    "[ free enrgy2 ] ) , determine that whether diffusing magnons can reach to the boundary of the chain or not and thus we have or have not the size effects in the model .",
    "therefore , we can summarize that the extra terms in the free energy emerge because of the finite size effects and in fact they can be interpreted as the interaction energy of the diffusing magnons with the boundary of the chain .    as a result , in the phase that the asymptotic limit of the finite xx0 model is given by the infinite xx0 model , no matter how far the diffusing magnons can proceed into the vacuum , still there will be an infinitely large ferromagnetic vacuum which is not occupied by the diffusing magnons . lets name this undisturbed vacuum as _",
    "intact vacuum_. therefore , the absence or present of finite size effect determines the existence or absence of intact vacuum in quantum state of xx0 model , respectively .",
    "in addition , the phase diagram of the finite xx0 model is also separated by @xmath60 domain wall , into two phases which is characterized by the absence or presence of the localized block of magnons , as discussed in section ( 4.1 ) .",
    "therefore , the different regions in the phase diagram of the finite xx0 model in the asymptotic limit are contrasted from each other by inclusion and exclusion of intact vacuum and localized block of magnons , separately .    in the rest of this section , based on the above interpretations",
    ", we will provide a physical description and schematic illustration , fig .",
    "4 , for each region of the complete phase diagram of xx0 model . to summarize , the phase structure of the finite xx0 model , determined by free energies ( eqs .",
    "[ free enrgy1 ] and [ free enrgy2 ] ) , has four domain walls dividing @xmath123 phase diagram into four regions , shown in the fig .",
    "[ n_tau ] , and each region has the following interpretation :    * in region ( i ) with @xmath140 and @xmath141 , the quantum state contains a localized block of magnons and some but not all of the magnons diffuse to the vacuum and sweep the whole ferromagenetic vacuum and at least one of them ( the last one in the row ) reach to the boundary of the chain and thus no intact vacuum remains .",
    "thus , it is a moderately large but finite size spin chain . * in region ( ii ) with @xmath142 and @xmath141 ,",
    "similar to region ( i ) there is a localized block of magnons in the quantum state , however , the diffusing magnons can not probe all the ferromagnetic vacuum and thus there will be an intact vacuum in the spin chain .",
    "thus , it is an infinite spin chain . * in region",
    "( iii ) with @xmath143 and @xmath91 , all the magnons from the initial localized block diffuses to the vacuum and there is no localized block of magnons , furthermore , at least a magnon probes the whole vacuum to its boundary and this causes the absence of the intact vacuum in the quantum state .",
    "thus , it is a finite spin chain with a moderately large size . * in region",
    "( iv ) with @xmath144 and @xmath91 , the quantum state contains an intact vacuum but no localized block of magnons .",
    "thus , it is an infinitely large spin chain .",
    "as we noticed in section ( 3.2 ) , weakly coupled xx0 model has a different scaling compare to strongly coupled model .",
    "this different scaling implies a different dictionary and interpretation for the weakly coupled model .",
    "however , as we will see , the weakly coupled xx0 model is governed by roughly the same dynamics as the strongly coupled model , obtained from the nibm .",
    "possible differences are originated from the different potentials in the corresponding matrix models and different values of the coupling in the hamiltonian .",
    "we obtained the weakly coupled system and its gaussian matrix model from @xmath145 and @xmath37 limits of the strongly coupled system with the gross - witten matrix model , thus we expect the same dynamical behavior for the diffusing magnons and nonintersecting vicious walkers in these limits .",
    "moreover , the gaussian matrix model appears in a version of nibm , called nonintersecting brownian bridge ( see appendix c.2 ) and therefore dynamics of weakly coupled xx0 model is obtained from nibm .",
    "we start our discussion with an obvious required changes to the proposed dictionary in section 3 .",
    "in contrast to gross - witten case that @xmath8 is the size of the spin chain , in the quadratic potential case , the size of the weakly coupled spin chain is given by @xmath96 .",
    "equivalently , the width @xmath146 of the nibm in the gross - witten case should be replaced by @xmath147 , as we transfer to the quadratic potential in the limit of gross - witten case , see section ( 3.2 ) and appendix c. on the other hand , the interpretations of @xmath19 and @xmath23 as the number of magnons and time , remain the same as in strongly coupled system .",
    "however , in the matrix model description of the weakly coupled xx0 model , @xmath23 and @xmath19 are at infinite limit , and dynamical parameter of the system , time @xmath23 , is hidden since it is identified with @xmath19 , as we fixed @xmath97 , see the discussion in section ( 3.2 ) .    in the case of",
    "weakly coupled infinite xx0 spin chain with partition function [ g free energy ] , the location of the system in the moduli space of the models is on the domain wall @xmath97 of the strongly coupled xx0 model and thus there is no gross - witten type phase transition for the weakly coupled infinite xx0 spin chain .",
    "this can also be seen from the fact that in the nonintersecting brownian bridge , see appendix c.2 , there is no freezed region for the path of vicious walkers and thus all the magnons are moving around in the ferromagnetic vacuum and we do not have localized block of magnons .",
    "thus , the weakly coupled xx0 model in the asymptotic limit is always in the diffusion phase of the strongly coupled model in fig .",
    "3 . however , as eq .",
    "[ g free enrgy2 ] indicates , the weakly coupled finite xx0 model in the asymptotic limit has a third order phase transition .",
    "using the interpretations discussed in previous part , it is easy to guess that the source of this phase transition is the finite size effects of the model .",
    "similar to the previous section , by using eqs .",
    "c.7 and c.8 in appendix [ mig ] , we can obtain the probability that a diffusing magnon in the vacuum of the weakly coupled xx0 model reaches to the boundary of the system in the asymptotic limit as @xmath148 consequently , the asymptotic of the tracy - widom distribution , eq .

    "roughly the same qualitative arguments about the diffusion dynamics of the magnons can be used to interpret the phase transition in weakly coupled xx0 model , fig .",
    "2 . in fact , the competition between the size of spin chain and the size of initial block of magnons leads to the phase transition between a phase that a diffusing magnon reaches to the boundary and we have size effects and another phase that a diffusing magnon does not reach to the boundary and there is no size effect . in this transition ,",

    "5 .    as final remark of this section",
    ", we should make it clear that in the proposed equilibrium quantum states , fig . 4 and 5 , which is obtained from the time evolution of the initial quantum states in the asymptotic limit for each phase of the xx0 model , we only focus on the definite features of the phase , such as localized block of magnons and intact vacuum but there are options for the spin configurations in the remaining part of the quantum state .",
    "these definite features are permanent characteristics of any quantum states in that phase , but the spin configurations of the remaining parts of the quantum state can be arbitrary chosen .",
    "for example , the final quantum state in eq .",
    "[ delta eq7 ] are chosen to be exactly equal to the initial quantum states .",
    "that means all the diffusing magnons should return to their original position and we calculate the probability of this event . in this case ,",

    ", we have chosen the initial and final quantum states such that the explicit evaluation of the correlation function , eq .",
    "[ delta eq7 ] , becomes mathematically feasible , because there is no schur functions in the matrix integrals , and the explicit results reveal the phase transitions in the xx0 model .",
    "however , any other correlation functions in xx0 model , at least with the same initial quantum state as in eq .",
    "[ delta eq7 ] but with an arbitrary final quantum state , in principle would determine the same phase structure , because the above definite features of the quantum states are still present .",
    "for correlation functions with arbitrary initial and final quantum state , see appendix d , eq .",
    "in this paper we studied the phase structure of the xx0 model via the explicit formulas for the free energy of the system in different regions of the moduli space of the parameters .",
    "the analytic results for the free energy , which led us to the phase structure of the model , were obtained by using the methods from the nibm and its asymptotic analysis .",
    "the tracy - widom distribution has played a crucial in this analysis and in fact , the tracy - widom distribution was the key tool to obtain the free energy of the system and to extract the phase transitions for the xx0 model .    as we discussed in this article ,",
    "some exact results about the xx0 spin chain are obtained .",
    "these results indicate a definite new phase structure of the model in the the limit of large parameters . it might be imagined that the limit of large parameters in the spin chain is kind of unphysical from the experimental point of view . however , as we have discussed in the interpretation part , very natural explanations for the phase structure in terms of the spin configurations exist .",
    "moreover , some arguments about the possible experimental observations and applications of the similar phase transitions are provided recently in .    having reviewed the obtained results and proposed interpretations , we continue with some possible directions for future studies in this topic .",
    "it might be thought that the appearance of the tracy - widom distribution is because of the special characteristics of the model , but in fact , the very existence and appearance of the tracy - widom distribution in the asymptotic limit of the nibm and xx0 model is a general fact , which does not depend on the physical details of the potential and/or other specific physical properties of the model .",
    "in fact , the emergence of this distribution in the xx0 model and its generalization is implied by the universality of this distribution in the random matrix theory and nibm . the tracy - widom distribution and hence the phase structure of the xx0 model",
    "have a universal character from the mathematical point of view . from physical point of view",
    ", one can argue that behavior of the xx0 model near its domain walls ( critical points ) of the phase transitions is independent of the details of the microscopic interactions and thus , a universal structure for the phase transition is expected .",
    "these ideas and facts are important clues for our future studies about universal features of the phase structure of generalized xx0 model with long - range interactions .",

    "the effects of quantum fluctuations become even more important , in the weak coupling regime , in which the aligning force between neighbouring spins is very weak and the intrinsic spin fluctuations become dominant .",

    "we mean that any segment of localized block of magnons or intact vacuum that are not adjacent to the spins with opposite direction has stable status and the spins in these segments do not tend to change the direction because of the coupling .",
    "moreover , the competition between the strong / weak couplings and the quantum fluctuations might eventually lead to completely new phase transitions in the system .",
    "this requires a separate and comprehensive study about the role of quantum fluctuations in shaping of a complete phase structure of the model .    in this study",
    ", we fixed the periodic boundary conditions for the spin chain , however , other boundary conditions such as antiperiodic , reflecting or aborbing are possible and appropriate .",
    "the new boundary conditions might bring new possibilities to the picture and deserve further studies . in this sense",
    ", some aspects of the problem have been studied in the context of nibm , .",
    "another direction for further studies in the phase structure of xx0 model can be explained as follow . the xx0 model and the nibm are closely related to the combinatorial models such as plane partitions and nonintersecting lattice paths .",
    "the enumerative combinatorics of these models provides us with exact techniques for counting the degeneracies in these models which in turn can be used to obtain the entropy of the xx0 model .",
    "the entropy consideration opens up the possibility for the investigation of the phase transitions in xx0 model from another perspective and plausible approach .",
    "a possible interesting question about the phase structure of xx0 model is to understand the nature of the second - order phase transition between region i and iii in fig.1 and fig.4 .",
    "this phase transition is similar to the gross - witten phase transition but it happens in a moderately large but finite size spin chain .    finally , using the relations between the heisenberg spin chains and various gauge theories such as chern - simons theories , supersymmetric gauge theories , etc",
    ". it would be fruitful to investigate the implications of the obtained results of this study , in the context of gauge theories .",
    "the authors deeply appreciate ezad shojaei , without whom this study would not have been initiated .",
    "this section provides explanations for one of the basic pillars of this study , i.e. the connection between xx0 model and nibm .",
    "this connection is essential for understanding the interpretation of the phase structure of xx0 model .",
    "in fact , our results are interpreted in terms of the dynamics of magnons , which is equivalent to the dynamics of vicious walkers in nibm . in order to describe the relation between the dynamics of xx0 model and nibm",
    ", we follow a mathematical description for the process of measurement in quantum mechanics of spin chains . roughly speaking ,",
    "this relation is originated in the probabilistic nature of measurement in quantum mechanics and stochastic nature of nibm .    in the context of our study , nibm is the propagation of @xmath16 vicious walkers , ( i.e. random walkers such that their paths do not intersect each other ) on an one - dimensional lattice with size @xmath8 and time scale @xmath23 . due to the one - dimensional degree of freedom in nibm",
    ", the random walk of each particle in nibm is confined between the back and front particles on the lattice . as a result ,",
    "their trajectories do not cross each other , as shown in fig .",
    "[ nibm1 ] for a nibm with reunion boundary conditions .",
    "this dynamics has been investigated and applied extensively in literature , namely in random matrix theory , , , , two - dimensional yang - mills theory , , three - dimensional chern - simons theory , kpz growing model , , etc .    to clarify the relationship between dynamics of xx0 model and nibm ,",
    "first we describe random motion ( diffusion ) of a magnon on a finite segment of xx0 spin chain and its relation to a random walk in the one - dimensional lattice .",
    "then , we consider two and more magnons to illuminate the nature of nonintersecting motion of magnons in xx0 model and random walkers in nibm .",
    "finally , we conclude that the dynamics of magnons in xx0 model is equivalent to that of random walkers in nibm .    _",
    "dynamics of magnons in xx0 spin chain_. let us review rudiments of xx0 spin chain .",
    "the spin operators act on the space @xmath152 spanned by @xmath153 where @xmath154 can be either plus spin , @xmath155 , or minus spin , @xmath156 .",
    "for example , the actions of the annihilation and creation operators on the up - spin states are @xmath157 , and @xmath158 , respectively .",
    "let us consider the hamiltonian of xx0 model , eq .",

    "the action of operator @xmath159 on two - spin state is to exchange the direction of spins when the spins are in opposite directions , otherwise , the action of operator give the null state , @xmath160 now , consider a state with a magnon in the @xmath161th site of a ferromagnetic vacuum . the action of hamiltonian eq .",
    "eq1 ] on this state leads to the entanglement of two different states as follow @xmath162 hence , in the measurement process , the system has to pick up one of these states with the equal probability . therefore , under the successive measurement",
    ", the position of a magnon moves through the ferromagnetic vacuum in spin chain exactly similar to a simple random walk .",
    "so far , we have seen that the diffusion of a magnon in xx0 spin chain is equivalent to an one - dimensional random walk .",
    "now , we take one step forward and put two magnons in the ferromagnetic vacuum . in this situation ,",
    "each magnon separately moves like a random walker except when the positions of magnons arrive to the adjacent sites . in this case , the action of @xmath159 on this state is @xmath163 as a result @xmath164 this means , as soon as two magnons arrive to each other , they act to get away from the contact point . in other words ,",
    "corresponding random walkers do not cross their trajectories . in the case of more than two magnons ,",
    "the motion of all magnons is similar to one - dimensional random walk with a condition , i.e. their path do not intersect each other .",
    "this exactly defines the vicious ( nonintersecting ) random walk and illuminates the nonintersecting character of magnons diffusion in the vacuum . to summarize ,",
    "the vicious walkers in one - dimensional lattice in nibm are equivalent to diffusing magnons in ferromagnetic vacuum of xx0 spin chain .",
    "the tracy - widom distribution function can be defined as @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the solution of painlev equation @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the airy function .",

    "<S> we show that , in the asymptotic limit , partition function of the model , written in terms of matrix integral , is governed by the tracy - widom distribution . </S>",
    "<S> second , the exact analytic results for the free energy , which is obtained by the asymptotic analysis of the tracy - widom distribution , indicate a completely new and sophisticated phase structure of the model . </S>",
    "<S> this phase structure consists of second- and third - order phase transitions . finally , to shed light on our new results , we provide a possible interpretation of the phase structure in terms of dynamical behavior of magnons in the spin chain . </S>",
