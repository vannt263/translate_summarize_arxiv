    "the first data provided by corot for @xmath0 scuti stars made clear that the larger the precision of the observations , the larger the number of observed modes @xcite . in the case , for example , of hd174936 @xcite , a @xmath0 scuti target of the initial corot run , the number of frequencies extracted from the observed light curves with the traditional tools can be of the order of thousands .",
    "the same can be said from other corot @xmath0 scuti and @xmath1 doradus targets .",
    "in such a scenario , the question if all these frequencies are real or not should be a previous step to any modeling attempt . to answer this ,",
    "our aim is to check if a @xmath0 scuti or a @xmath1 doradus star has enough energy to excite such a large amount of modes simultaneously and with the observed amplitudes , for which we need to know the real energy of the modes .    up to our knowledge ,",
    "the only existing studies about the real energy of the modes , through characterisation of their amplitudes , are for stochastic pulsators ( as solar - like stars ) which were done through a description of the non - linear effects in the pulsation equations @xcite . in the case of thermodynamic pulsators ,",
    "as those driven by a @xmath2 mechanism , this kind of studies have not yet been attempted , since the non - adiabatic studies have been done in the linear approximation @xcite .",
    "therefore , the solutions yielded by the pulsation codes are not absolute , as they are affected by a constant indefinite factor , and only ratios of observed and theoretical quantities can be compared .",
    "we scaled the solutions given by the non - adiabatic linear pulsational code graco @xcite to absolute values using the observational amplitudes provided by space and ground - base data , as described below . in this way",
    ", we were able to compare the derived absolute values of the required pulsational energy to simultaneously excite all the observed modes , with the real energy available for exciting the modes .",
    "in our study we use one of the models best reproducing the ground - based and space observations obtained for the @xmath0 scuti hd174936 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a model at the centre of the observed hr photometric error box for the hybrid @xmath0 scuti - @xmath1 doradus star hd49434 .",
    "in order to check the consistency of our procedure , we use a representative model of the largest amplitude pulsator known , classical cepheid stars presenting variations of the order of magnitudes , and verified that it is energetically stable under its pulsations .",
    "to determine the energy needed by the system to unstabilize all of the observed modes , we have to face the problem that most of the pulsational codes , and in particular the non - adiabatic ones , use the linear approximation to solve the system of differential equations .",
    "aside from non - linear physical effects , negligible for small pulsational amplitudes , this means that every eigenfunction of an oscillation mode is known except for a multiplicative constant , i.e. , if @xmath3 are the solutions of the set of differential equations for a given mode , @xmath4 , @xmath5 being a constant , are also solutions . therefore , before doing any study about the global properties of the star , we have to determine the value of this constant ( @xmath6 ) scaling the linear solutions of each mode to the real values .    in the linear approximation ,",
    "the problem of this indefinite constant is solved by scaling all the solutions of the pulsation equations to an arbitrary normalization condition .",
    "most pulsation codes use as normalization condition    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the radial eigenfunction @xcite .",
    "the real pulsation amplitude on the surface is given by    @xmath9    and following eq .",
    "[ norm ]    @xmath10    therefore , the multiplicative constant @xmath6 , scaling all the linear solutions to the real values of the pulsation , may be obtained through the oscillation amplitude of the relative radius at the surface of the star .",
    "this value can be deduced from the oscillation amplitude of the observed luminosity .",
    "we use the observed amplitude spectrum for hd174936 ( fig .",
    "[ espec ] and * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as an example to illustrate the procedure here presented .",
    "the spectrum shows a maximum oscillation amplitude of about 2  mmag , which would correspond to a low - degree mode .",
    "decreasing amplitudes are found at both sides of this highest amplitude mode .",
    "therefore , we assume that : `` the mode amplitude is given by a gaussian distribution centered in the largest amplitude mode , with the maximum amplitude of this mode , and the variance fixed by the decrease in amplitude of the modes closest to the highest one .",
    "this intrinsic amplitude is independent of the spherical degree @xmath11 of the mode '' .",
    "the oscillation amplitudes of the other modes , out of the highest amplitude one , would be affected by geometrical visibility , which is translated in amplitudes lower than the predicted gaussian envelope .    in this case , the distribution is centered on 377  @xmath12hz , with a maximum amplitude of 2.12  mmag and a square root of the variance @xmath13hz .",
    "the assumed oscillation amplitudes are also shown in fig .",
    "[ espec ] ( left , plus signs ) , compared with the observed amplitude spectrum .",
    "we notice that a significant number of observed amplitudes fall out of the range @xmath14~\\mu$]hz , where our distribution predicts amplitudes close to zero",
    ". therefore , we built a modified distribution as the addition of the gaussian already explained plus a flat - background at 0.3  mmag for the modes with negligible amplitude ( fig .",
    "[ espec ] , right , plus signs ) .",
    "there is no physical reasons for this election , but only a fitting of the observations .",
    "the value of the background was chosen to take into account the amplitude of the observed mode at 158.1  @xmath12hz , and the distribution is spanned in the range @xmath15~\\mu$]hz well comprising the canonical range of observed modes for @xmath0 scuti .",
    "we deliberately leave out modes under 100  @xmath12hz as they lay far out of the instability range of @xmath0 scuti and no model is able to predict their excitation .",
    "the next step is to relate this intrinsic oscillation amplitude in luminosity to oscillation amplitude in relative radius .",
    "to do so , we use the definition of the apparent magnitude variation for a certain wavelength given by @xcite    @xmath16    where @xmath5 is the projected area of the photosphere , and @xmath17 is the variation in surface brightness defined as    @xmath18    with @xmath19 being the projected flux at a certain wavelength .",
    "given that the unknown multiplicative constant is defined by the variation of the radius , we are only interested in the intrinsic amplitude of the radial eigenfunction . therefore , although the relative variation of the projected surface area @xmath20 includes dependencies as the degree @xmath11 of the modes , the viewing angle or the limb darkening , we may adopt , for our purposes , @xmath21 as the radial variation of the total surface of the star .",
    "in addition , as the observed corot amplitude spectrum for hd174936 was taken in white light , we will consider @xmath19 as the total flux at the surface .",
    "therefore , @xmath22 , since the bolometric magnitude ( @xmath23 ) and absolute magnitude ( @xmath24 ) differ only in a constant .",
    "including all this in eq .",
    "[ eq : mlambda ] yields    @xmath25\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 is stefan boltzmann constant .",
    "simple calculations give :    @xmath27    therefore , the variations in brightness are a combination of the variations of the relative radius and the relative flux at the surface of the star , measured through relative variations of the effective temperature",
    ". the observed variations of the relative radius may be obtained as    @xmath28    where    @xmath29    the negative sign of this equation is related to the definition of the stellar magnitude and it has no physical origin",
    ". we will not take it into account in the rest of this study , since it has no influence in the results .",
    "therefore , once the variations in brightness are known , the relative radius variations can be obtained , as the variable @xmath30 is supplied by the non - adiabatic equations .",
    "we used the graco non - adiabatic code for this purpose , including the time dependent convection description ( tdc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although its inclusion revealed of no significance in the results .",
    "the final relative radius variations as a function of the frequency of the modes for the two distributions are displayed also in fig .",
    "[ espec ] .",
    "once the multiplicative constant @xmath31 scaling all the linear solutions to their real values is known , the absolute values of the kinetic energy and the energy required to excite the observed modes can be estimated .",
    "then , they can be compared to the energy balancing the star and the energy available in the star , respectively .    to check",
    "if the star is able to have thousands of modes excited at a time , we have to verify 1 ) if the energy flux is enough to provide the energy that all these modes need per second , and 2 ) if the total kinetic energy accumulated in them does not destroy the equilibrium structure of the star .",
    "we note that quantitative estimations of upper limits of these energies are enough to achieve the aims of this work .",
    "three stellar cases have been studied : 1 ) a representative model of the classical cepheid stellar type , adopting the largest pulsation amplitude reported ( around 2  mag ) as a falsifiability test of our main assumptions , 2 ) the @xmath0 scuti star hd174936 , and 3 ) the hybrid @xmath0 scuti - @xmath1 doradus star hd49434 .    for the latter two cases , we have used corot and ground - based observations . in the case of hd49434 , the publication of",
    "the data analysis is still in preparation and we used here only some general and preliminary results , which is , however , enough for our purpose .",
    "our first stellar case applies to the variable stellar type with the highest amplitude luminosity known to date , the classical cepheid type .",
    "this type of stars do not show a large amount of pulsational modes ; however , we are going to use it as a test of falsifiability of our main hypotheses , since for them , its high variability offsets the smaller number of pulsation modes .",
    "we built a representative equilibrium model lying in the classical cepheid instability strip @xcite .",
    "the main physical characteristics of this model are displayed in table 1 , and are similar to one of the thoeretical models studied in @xcite . the energy balance of the pulsational modes",
    "is then compared to some absolute values of the star and with some theoretical results obtained through non - linear resolutions , as described in section  2 .",
    "the variation of the relative radius of the fundamental radial mode obtained following our procedure ( @xmath32 ) is similar to the predicted for an equivalent non - linear model described in @xcite ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the energy balance between gains and losses , for a single mode , in a complete period of oscillation is given by @xcite    @xmath34    this quantity is provided by graco and can also be regarded as the required energy for each mode to be driven during one oscillation cycle .",
    "the scaling of the linear solutions to their real values is done multiplying eq .",
    "9 by @xmath35 .",
    "as we are interested in an upper limit for this quantity , we assume that for every mode the energy balance is positive , i.e. that each mode removes energy from the star .",
    "this is only true for unstable modes , as stable modes transfer energy to the star .",
    "however , in this way , we make sure that the real amount of energy subtracted by the modes from the star , regardless of the theory used to obtain it , will be always lower than our estimated upper limit .",
    "the total energy during a cycle of oscillation is given by the sum of all the energy interchanged by all the modes in the observed frequency range .",
    "we compared this energy to the luminosity of the star , as a measure of the available radiation energy per time unit . for classical cepheid stars ,",
    "we have used the fundamental radial mode and its overtones .",
    "therefore , the sum of @xmath36 for each mode ( @xmath26 being the frequency of the mode in @xmath37 ) yields a total energy per time unit needed by the modes to be overstable of @xmath38  ergs  s@xmath39 .",
    "the luminosity of the star is of the order of @xmath40  ergs  s@xmath39 , that is , one order of magnitude higher .",
    "as we expected the real energy value to be even lower than the one estimated here , we conclude that this extreme case has enough energy per time unit to unstabilize all observed modes .",
    "this result is used only to legitimize our main assumptions .      for the second comparison",
    "we have calculated the kinetic energy of each mode as @xcite    @xmath41    once the kinetic energy of each mode is scaled by its variation of the relative radius ( multiplying by @xmath35 ) , the total sum of the kinetic energies of the selected modes gives a total kinetic energy of the order of @xmath42  ergs .",
    "@xcite give the same order of magnitude for the kinetic energy of the model we are comparing with .",
    "this value has to be compared also with the total energy of the star , i.e. , the sum of the internal energy of the star , mass , rotational kinetic energy , turbulent energy , gravitational energy , etc .",
    "the estimation of all these parameters is a complex task , but the gravitational energy that holds the star together is already of the order of @xmath43  ergs .",
    "therefore , we can infer that the total kinetic energy of pulsations of the radial modes for the case of the classical cepheid stars is low enough for the star to bear it maintaining the hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "again , our assumptions are validated with this test .",
    "the @xmath0 scuti hd174936 was the first corot target of this stellar type ( together with hd50844 ) presenting unexpected space data .",
    "the observational spectrum and the relative variation of the radius have already been presented and explained in section 2 and depicted in fig .",
    "1 . the physical characteristics of the model used are displayed in table  1 .",
    "the total energy per oscillation cycle is given by the sum of all the energy interchanged by all the modes in the frequency range @xmath15~\\mu$]hz ( a generous gamut for @xmath0 scutis , as we said above ) and with degrees @xmath44 $ ] , to be able to account for the thousands of observed modes .",
    "the observation of spherical degrees up to @xmath45 with high - precision photometric time series were predicted by @xcite .",
    "the sum of @xmath36 for each mode yields a total energy per time unit needed by the modes to be overstable of @xmath46  ergs  s@xmath39 , for both proposed amplitude distributions ( with and without tdc ) .",
    "the luminosity of the star is of the order of @xmath47  ergs  s@xmath39 , that is , five orders of magnitude higher .",
    "consequently , as the real energy value is even lower than the one here estimated , we conclude that the star has enough energy per time unit to unstabilize all the observed modes .",
    "on the other hand , the total sum of the kinetic energies of the selected modes gives a total kinetic energy in the range @xmath48 $ ]  ergs , depending on the amplitude distribution .",
    "the gravitational energy holding the star together is of the order of @xmath49  ergs .",
    "therefore , as in the previous case , the total kinetic energy of pulsations of the thousands of modes is low enough for the star to bear it maintaining the hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the last stellar case studied is an hybrid @xmath0 scuti - @xmath1 doradus star : hd49434 which has also been observed by corot .",
    "the analysis of its light - curve is still in progress and the results have not yet been published .",
    "hence , we use only the preliminary result that thousands of modes have been detected in the @xmath50 doradus region , tens of them reported as `` undoubtly '' real ( private communication ) .",
    "pulsations in the @xmath0 scuti region of the frequency spectrum have also been reported @xcite .",
    "we assume that in this region the situation is similar to that found for hd174936 in order to study a possible future situation .",
    "@xcite did ground - based multisite observations for this star : we use the highest amplitude mode reported , to fix the center and maximum amplitude of our gaussian distribution .",
    "the mode has a photometric amplitude of 2.0  mmag at a frequency of 20  @xmath12hz .",
    "the observed frequencies in the @xmath0 scuti region present values around 90  @xmath12hz .",
    "we have proceed in a way similar to the previous case , but using a double gaussian , one for each region presenting pulsational modes .",
    "a flat - background of 0.3  mmag has also been used for a second possible distribution , as explained in section  2 .",
    "we built a model fulfilling the physical characteristics shown in @xcite ( see table 1 . ) .",
    "for this study , frequencies in the range @xmath51\\mu$]hz , to well cover the @xmath0 sct and @xmath1 dor range , and degrees in the range @xmath52 have been used .",
    "we obtain that the total energy per time unit needed by the modes to be overstable is of the order of @xmath53  ergs  s@xmath39 ( only using tdc , more suitable for @xmath1 dor targets ) .",
    "the luminosity of the star is of the order of @xmath47  ergs  s@xmath39 , that is , four orders of magnitude higher .",
    "we conclude again that the star has enough energy per time unit to unstabilize all the possible modes .",
    "the total sum of the kinetic energies of the modes selected are in the range @xmath54 $ ]  ergs , depending on the amplitude distribution .",
    "the gravitational energy that holds the star together is of the order @xmath43  ergs .",
    "again , we conclude that the total kinetic energy of pulsation of the thousands of modes is low enough for the star to bear it maintaining its hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "using a non - adiabatic linear pulsational code , we have related the observed variation in brightness of classical cepheid stars , a @xmath0 scuti , and an hybrid @xmath0 sct-@xmath1 dor star with the intrinsic variation of their relative radius .",
    "this has allowed us to scale theoretical quantities from this linear code of oscillations to real values of the star , and to make the first comparison to date , up to our knowledge , of absolute pulsational quantities with absolute parameters of non - stochastic pulsating stars .",
    "the subsequent analysis of the total kinetic energy of the thousands of observed modes , and of the required energy to excite them , shows that all of them have enough energy to sustain their oscillation .",
    "our study shows that the results yielded by the analyses of the light curves with the classical tools ( standard sine wave fitting ) dot not come into conflict with what it is physically possible ."
