    "the combination of recent measurements of distant supernovae type ia ( sne ia ) apparent magnitudes @xcite , cosmic microwave background anisotropy @xcite , the baryon acoustic signal in the power spectrum of galaxies @xcite , and galaxy cluster gas mass fractions @xcite indicates at high confidence that about 70% of the energy budget of the universe comes from non - luminous dark energy that is close to spatially uniform and has negative pressure .",
    "although the existence of dark energy is now a well - established observational fact its physical nature is still a topic of great debate .",
    "the simplest and historically first physical model of dark energy is the cosmological constant @xmath0 that has an equation of state @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is its pressure and @xmath3 the energy density @xcite .",
    "the cosmological constant is introduced by hand into the equations of general relativity but could be related to the energy of the fluctuating vacuum .",
    "this @xmath0cdm model , although simple and in good accord with most available cosmological datacdm model assumes the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model of structure formation which might have some observational inconsistencies ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "] ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , has a number of theoretical shortcomings ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these include the so - called `` smallness '' and `` coincidence '' problems .",
    "the measured value of the cosmological constant energy scale is of order @xmath4 , some 30 orders of magnitude smaller than the planck scale , perhaps what we would expect the vacuum energy scale to be based on simple quantum field theoretical arguments . in addition , since the energy density of nonrelativistic matter is decreasing with the expansion of the universe while the energy density of a cosmological constant is constant , there is a very narrow window in time when both of these have comparable energy densities , and it is unclear why we happen to live at this special time .    because of these and other issues a number of different dark energy models have been considered .",
    "typically these introduce a new component that acts like a cosmological constant , in that it is close to spatially homogeneous , while gradually decreasing in time to the small currently observed value .",
    "an early example of this class of models is the @xmath5cdm model in which dark energy is taken to be a scalar field @xmath5 @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the current cosmological constant energy scale is small because the universe is old . for recent reviews of dark energy",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite.cdm model , we consider in this paper the dark energy scalar field couples to the matter only through gravity . for dark energy models with less restrictive couplings",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein . for other dark energy models",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein . ]",
    "although available cosmological data can constrain dark energy models , they are not yet good enough to strongly discriminate between different dark energy models ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) . in the near future better - quality and more independent cosmological observations",
    "should be able to break this degeneracy ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "sne ia were one of the first cosmological probes to give direct evidence for dark energy .",
    "these are very bright exploding stars and are standardizable candles that can be seen to very large distances .",
    "more then 300 well - calibrated distant sne ia have already been observed up to the redshift of 1.6 @xcite .",
    "these measurements alone give more then 5@xmath6 evidence for the existence of dark energy , but they are not very effective in constraining dark energy model parameters overall unless used in combination with other data .",
    "even when current sne ia data are combined with all other currently available data sets , we can not yet determine if the energy density of dark energy is constant as required by the @xmath0cdm model or if it varies in time as suggested by dynamical alternatives such as @xmath5cdm .",
    "a dedicated sne ia space mission should result in significantly more higher quality data that should help resolve this issue ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein . ) .",
    "one way of improving our understanding of how dark energy behaves is to study the evolution of the universe at redshifts higher than those probed by sne ia .",
    "this requires standard candles that are visible at great distances .",
    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) could in principle serve as such high redshift standardizable candles .",
    "they are the most luminous events in the universe today and can be seen beyond @xmath7 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . if it is definitely established that grbs are standardizable candles , their visibility at high - redshift should prove to be very useful in discriminating between @xmath0cdm and time - varying dark energy models .    with the intention of getting cosmological constraints from grb observations a number of grb calibrations",
    "have been used so far ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "one that gives least scatter and therefore most information is @xmath8 a relation that connects the total burst energy of the grb ( @xmath9 ) to the peak energy of the grb spectrum ( @xmath10 ) @xcite .",
    "regrettably , we do not yet have a model - independent way of computing the coefficients @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    ". a better understanding of physical processes that result in the burst , or observations of nearby grbs ( to which distances can be measured independently ) , could in principle help us to calibrate the @xmath9-@xmath10 relation without any prior assumptions .",
    "to extract cosmological information , grbs have to be recalibrated for every dark energy model considered ( at each set of parameter values ) .",
    "this is time consuming and also results in large statistical uncertainties and hence grb cosmological constraints that are poor .",
    "recently , methods of calibrating grbs in cosmology - independent manners have been proposed and used to constrain some dark energy models ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* that use sne ia measurements to externally calibrated grbs ) .",
    "the resulting cosmological constraints are still loose , but in the future when more high precision grb observations become available this could provide a strong test of dark energy .",
    "@xcite recently used data of 69 grbs @xcite to construct a distance measure that can be used to constrain cosmological models .",
    "the advantage of this method is that internally calibrated grb data may be straightforwardly combined with other data when deriving cosmological constraints . on the other hand , with this method",
    "the resulting cosmological results are sensitive to the chosen binning .",
    "this method also requires an input cosmological model and thus is not completely cosmology independent .",
    "when this method is used to constrain @xmath0cdm the grb data favor lower values of both cosmological constant energy density ( @xmath13 ) and nonrelativistic matter energy density ( @xmath14 ) than do the sne ia data .",
    "the grb data by themselves are unable to strongly constrain cosmological parameters , for example in spatially flat",
    "@xmath0cdm the grb data require @xmath15 at 1@xmath6 confidence @xcite .",
    "in this paper we use grb data to constrain time variation of dark energy s energy density .",
    "first we recalibrate grbs for each cosmological model and compare the result with the ones derived using the data and method of @xcite .",
    "we consider a @xmath5cdm model where a scalar field which is close to spatially uniform on cosmological scales slowly rolls down an almost flat potential and plays the role of dark energy .    in the next section ,",
    "we summarize the dynamics of this scalar field dark energy model . in section  3",
    ", we describe our methods and computations .",
    "we present and discuss our results in section  4 .",
    "in the @xmath5cdm model , consistent with the indications from cosmic microwave background anisotropy measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we only consider the spatially flat universe case . the invariant four - interval in a homogeneous and isotropic version of such a universe is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is cosmic time",
    ", @xmath18 is the spatial separation in three - dimensional euclidean space and @xmath19 is the time - dependent scale factor which determines the change in distance between two distant noninteracting test particles in the universe .    in the set of models we consider the scalar field @xmath5 with lagrangian density @xmath20 is the dark energy . here",
    "@xmath21 is the potential energy density of the scalar field . in the expanding , spatially homogeneous and isotropic universe described in equation",
    "the spatially homogeneous scalar field obeys the modified klein - gordon equation ,    @xmath22    and the dynamics of the scale factor is governed by    @xmath23    in equation  ( [ friedman ] ) , @xmath24 is the universal gravitational constant , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the energy densities of nonrelativistic matter and the scalar field , respectively .",
    "if the scalar field is uniform in space then , from equation  ( [ lagrangian ] ) , the energy density of the scalar field is    @xmath27    since an underlying more fundamental explanation of dark energy remains elusive , there is as yet no first principles way of choosing the scalar field potential .",
    "if we choose the potential energy density to be inversely proportional to a power of the scalar field , @xmath28 , the @xmath5cdm model has a number of very interesting features @xcite .",
    "first , even if the scalar field starts off from a very high energy density state , its energy density decreases to a very small value during the course of cosmic evolution .",
    "second , in the radiation and matter - dominated epochs the evolution of the scalar field `` tracks '' the evolution of the dominant component . the scalar field slowly comes to dominate , leading to the end of matter domination and the start of the scalar field - dominated epoch .",
    "so , in the @xmath5cdm scenario the `` smallness '' and `` coincidence '' problems mentioned above are partially resolved because of the time - evolution properties of the scalar field .",
    "even if the scalar field potential is not exactly inverse power law , this form of potential provides a very economic way of parameterizing the slowly - evolving dark energy scenario with just one positive parameter @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , unlike the xcdm parameterization of dark energy , the @xmath5cdm model is physically consistent ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ".    in the @xmath5cdm model , the dark energy density , unlike the cosmological constant , varies slowly in time .",
    "the dark energy density increases as we go back in time and larger values of @xmath29 correspond to faster evolution of dark energy . as a result ,",
    "observable quantities such as luminosity and angular diameter distances in the @xmath5cdm model differ from the predictions of the @xmath0cdm model with a time - independent cosmological constant .",
    "some predictions , of course , depend also on the values of other cosmological parameters , such as the hubble constant @xmath30 or the energy density of baryonic matter @xmath31 , and so many independent cosmological tests are required to break this degeneracy and constrain dark energy model parameters .    a number of cosmological tests have been used to constrain the @xmath5cdm model , including the angular sizes of radio sources and quasars as a function of redshift @xcite , the apparent magnitude of sne ia as a function of redshift @xcite , and the gas mass fraction of large relaxed clusters as a function of redshift @xcite .",
    "current cosmological observations are in good agreement with a time - independent cosmological constant in a close to spatially flat @xmath0cdm model , but slowly rolling scalar field dark energy in the @xmath5cdm model is not yet ruled out at high confidence .    in this paper",
    "we use measured grb luminosity distance as a function of redshift to constrain slowly rolling scalar field and other dark energy models . because of the calibration problems mentioned above , grb data alone can not constrain cosmological parameters effectively .",
    "we also combine the results obtained from the grb analysis with constraints from sne ia and baryon acoustic peak measurements , to illustrate the effect and weight of current grb data in such a combined analysis .",
    "besides the @xmath10@xmath32 relation , ( equation  ) , @xcite uses four other calibrations for grbs that relate total luminosity to directly measurable quantities .",
    "these calibration relations are given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the absolute luminosity , @xmath35 is the grb lag time ( the time shift between the hard and soft curves ) , @xmath36 is the variability ( the normalized variance of an observed light curve around the smoothed light curve ) , @xmath10 is the peak energy of the grb , and @xmath37 is the rise time or the time over which the light curve rises by half of the peak flux .",
    "following @xcite we take equations  ( [ eq : calibr ] ) and ( [ ee ] ) and for each cosmological model find the best - fit values for the @xmath38 and @xmath39 parameters using the bisector least - square method ( for a description see * ? ? ?",
    "we use the best - fit @xmath38 and @xmath39 values and the measured @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath10 , @xmath37 values to compute @xmath34 and @xmath32 using the same equations  ( [ eq : calibr ] ) and ( [ ee ] ) . for each calibration relation",
    "we then compute the luminosity distance as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the bolometric peak flux and @xmath42 is the bolometric fluence of the grb .",
    "@xmath43 is so - called beam factor @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a jet opening angle .",
    "we then derive an effective luminosity distance by weighting the five estimates of grb luminosity distances , @xmath46 where index @xmath47 runs over 69 redshift bins , and @xmath29 over five calibration relations . to constrain cosmological parameters we use @xmath48",
    "defined by @xmath49    we also adopt the method of @xcite for using grb data to constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "she placed each of the 69 grbs in the redshift range @xmath50 to @xmath51 @xcite at a luminosity distance that minimized a combined @xmath48 that took weighted account of all five calibration relations .",
    "she then computed a distance measure @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the luminosity distance at redshift @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is the speed of light .",
    "the ratio in equation  ( [ dm ] ) does not depend on the hubble constant and does not require information about the absolute calibration of grbs ( which are unknown ) .",
    "@xcite computed the distance measure @xmath58 in six redshift bins @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "the values of @xmath61 are shown in table  ii and the normalized covariance matrix is shown in table  iii of @xcite . for currently viable cosmological models ,",
    "these @xmath59 are almost completely independent of the cosmological model and so provide a useful summary of current grb data @xcite .",
    "this information can be used to constrain any dark energy model and the resulting grb data constraints can be straightforwardly combined with other constraints . in this approach",
    ", @xmath48 is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 @xmath64 is the normalized covariance matrix given in table  iii of @xcite and summation over repeated indexes is assumed . here",
    ", @xmath65 is @xmath66 if @xmath67 and @xmath68 if @xmath69 .    in this paper",
    "we consider three cosmological models , @xmath0cdm , the xcdm parameterization of the dark energy equation of state @xmath70 in a spatially flat universe , and the spatially flat @xmath5cdm model . since we are comparing low - redshift predictions to observations we ignore the contribution of radiation in these models .",
    "in this case , in all three models , the background evolution can be fully described by two parameters , the fractional energy density of nonrelativistic matter @xmath14 and a parameter @xmath2 that describes the properties of dark energy . in @xmath0cdm @xmath2 is the fractional energy density of the cosmological constant @xmath13 , in xcdm it is the equation of state parameter @xmath71 , and in @xmath5cdm it is the positive parameter @xmath29 that governs the steepness of the scalar field potential energy density .    in each model , for both methods , we divide the two - dimensional space of cosmological parameters into an equidistant grid , and for each pair of parameters @xmath14 and @xmath2 we compute the theoretical luminosity distance .",
    "we then compute the difference between the theoretical prediction and the measured value at each of the 69 redshifts listed in table 2 of @xcite or the six redshifts listed in table  ii of @xcite ,    the best - fit parameters are defined as the pair @xmath72 that gives the minimum value of @xmath73 .",
    "the 1@xmath6 , 2@xmath6 , and 3@xmath6 confidence level contours are defined as the sets of points where the value of @xmath73 is more than its minimum value @xmath74 by 2.30 , 6.18 , and 11.83 , respectively . if the likelihood function , @xmath75 , was gaussian , the 3@xmath6 contour would be 99.7% likely to enclose the true values of cosmological parameters . in our case",
    "the likelihood function has a single maximum and decreases monotonically from the best - fit value point , so the true values of cosmological parameters are very unlikely to be outside the 3@xmath6 contours we compute",
    ".    figures 16 show the constraints from the @xcite grb data on @xmath0cdm , xcdm , and @xmath5cdm model parameters .",
    "figures 712 show the constraints derived using a method similar to that of @xcite .",
    "the grb constraints shown in figures  13 are consistent with the `` standard '' spatially flat @xmath76 @xmath0cdm model at a little under 2@xmath6 , with the grbs mildly favoring a somewhat lower value of @xmath77 than the `` standard '' value that is compensated by space curvature and @xmath78 ( figure  1 ) or a mildly time - varying dark energy ( figures  2 and 3 ) . while the constraints of figs .",
    "13 derived from the @xcite data have not previously been shown , these results are implicit in the discussions of @xcite and other analyses of grb constraints , including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    these results , and the fact that the current grb data contours are quite broad , are probably an indication of the preliminary nature of the current grb data .",
    "current grb data by themselves are unable to effectively constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "the grb constraints however , are a little tighter than radio galaxy angular size versus redshift constraints ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , constraints from strong gravitational lensing data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and those from the measurement of the hubble parameter as a function of redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to get tighter constraints on cosmological parameters , and to see how current grb data affect constraints derived from other data sets , we combine the results of our grb analysis with sne ia apparent magnitude versus redshift data ( the union data of * ? ?",
    "* ) and measurements of the baryon acoustic ( bao ) peak @xcite .",
    "since all three sets of measurements are independent , we define the total likelihood function of cosmological parameters for the combined data as a product of the individual likelihood functions ,      and compute the best - fit values and confidence level contours from @xmath80 as before . the sne ia likelihood",
    "function @xmath81 depends on the assumptions that we make about the value of the hubble constant .",
    "here we marginalize over @xmath82 with the    46 show the constraints on cosmological parameters of the @xmath0cdm , xcdm , and @xmath5cdm models from a joint analysis of the sne ia union and baryon acoustic peak measurements , without and with the grb data .",
    "these plots show that current grb data only marginally affect the joint sneia and bao peak constraints ( which are amongst the tightest provided by current data ) , favoring slightly lower values of the nonrelativistic matter density parameter @xmath14 .",
    "figures 79 are similar to figures  13 , but derived by recalibrating grb data for each cosmology , using a method similar to that of @xcite .",
    "the `` standard '' spatially flat @xmath83 @xmath0cdm model is about 2.5@xmath6 from the best - fit value . in all three models",
    "grb data favor a nonrelativistic matter - dominated universe .",
    "figures 1012 show the joint constraints from grb , sne ia and bao data .",
    "the constraints are dominated by the sne ia and bao data , with the grb data shifting the best - fit values to slightly larger values of @xmath14 .",
    "the grb constraints derived using the two different methods disagree with each other at more than 2@xmath6 confidence level ( compare figures  13 and 79 ) .",
    "this is somewhat worrying but not completely unexpected as the field is still under rapid development .",
    "grb data alone do not provide tight constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "moreover , while not greatly significant , current grb data favor cosmological parameter values that are at odds with what other data favor . when used in combination with some of the highest - quality current data ( e.g. , sne ia and bao peak measurements ) current grb data only slightly change the results .",
    "this is mainly because in the absence of an absolute calibration of grbs they , as standard candles , have big measurement uncertainties .",
    "this is however quite likely to change as more and better - quality grb measurements become available with improvements in methods to calibrate grbs .",
    "grbs could potentially provide a very strong test of the time variation of dark energy as they can be observed up to redshifts beyond eight , at distances where other standard candles can not be detected .                                                                                                                                                                                                            , 2@xmath6 , and 3@xmath6 confidence level contours for the @xmath0cdm model from the grb data , derived using the method of @xcite .",
