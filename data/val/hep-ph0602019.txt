    "the left - right polarization - dependent lifetime asymmetry has been proposed based on theoretical analyses and concrete calculations for decays of muons within the framework of the electroweak standard model ( sm ) in particle physics @xcite .",
    "it is pointed out that the right - handed ( rh ) polarized fermion lifetime @xmath2 is different from the left - handed ( lh ) polarized fermion lifetime @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the average lifetime , @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the velocity of the fermions measured in a natural system of units in which @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the lifetime in the fermion rest frame .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) shows that the lifetime of rh polarized fermions is always greater than that of lh polarized fermions in flight with the same speed in any inertial frame . as shown in fig .",

    "the lifetime as a function of fermion velocity @xmath7 .",
    "( a ) the lifetime @xmath2 of right - handed polarized fermions .",
    "( b ) the lifetime @xmath3 of left - handed polarized fermions .",
    "( c ) the lifetime @xmath5 of unpolarized fermions . ]",
    "parity violation causes @xmath3 and @xmath2 to be different .",
    "the lifetime asymmetry is defined as @xmath18 obviously , the lifetime asymmetry , @xmath19 , is proportional to the velocity @xmath7 of fermion .",
    "similarly , for antifermions in flight , the left - right lifetime asymmetry is given by @xmath20    as is well known , parity nonconservation implies that fermions exhibit asymmetrical behavior with respect to the right and the left in weak interactions .",
    "the existing experiments do indicate that fermions from decay processes are polarized in their direction of motion and their angular distributions with respect to the momentum of decaying particles are forward - backward asymmetrical .",
    "however , the measurement on the lifetime of polarized fermions in flight has not yet been found in literature .",
    "so - called left - right lifetime symmetry is so far merely a theoretical prediction or hypothesis unverified by experimental evidence .",
    "we actually lack any direct experimental evidence either to validate or to invalidate the lifetime asymmetry .    in this paper , many experiments , including the measurement on the lifetime of the neutrons , the @xmath21 leptons , the @xmath5 leptons and the g-2 experiment , will be analyzed in detail .",
    "the results show that existing experiments can not test the lifetime asymmetry .",
    "the measurements of the left - right cross section asymmetry in @xmath22 boson production by @xmath23 collisions and by electron - electron mller scattering will also be discussed .",
    "it is pointed out emphatically that the left - right cross section asymmetry in the neutral weak currents has already indirectly demonstrated the lifetime asymmetry .",
    "finally , some possible experiments will be suggested which might directly test the lifetime asymmetry .",
    "if the lifetime asymmetry is indeed found , it could have important consequences , both theoretical and experimental . because the lifetime asymmetry is a natural result of the standard model",
    ", its measurement will provide a new and powerful technique for testing the sm .",
    "in order to test the lifetime asymmetry , the fermions must be polarized and the experiments must be performed in their motion , i.e. , the fermions must be moving with respect to the detector .",
    "as seen from formula ( [ eq:2 ] ) , the lifetime asymmetry @xmath24 , so that it increases with the increase of velocity @xmath7 or energy of fermion , and is negligible at low energy .",
    "published neutron lifetimes were measured by using thermal or cold neutron beams @xcite .",
    "the energy of these beams is below 1 ev which is too low for the lifetime asymmetry effect to be observed .",
    "the velocity of high energy muons can exceed @xmath25 , so the polarized muons are ideal objects to test the lifetime asymmetry .",
    "unfortunately , all experiments for measuring the lifetime of muons were performed in the muon rest frame . in these experiments ,",
    "the muons were stopped in a nuclear emulsion , sulphur , aluminum , calcium or polyethylene target etc . in charm experiment @xcite , for example , the positive muons were produced by scattering of antineutrinos on nucleons and found to have positive helicity .",
    "the decay process ( @xmath26 ) of muons was investigated by a measurement of the time distribution of the positrons and from which a muon lifetime has been derived . however , it is noteworthy that the polarized muons were stopped in target material marble ( caco@xmath27 ) and  the decay positron had to be recorded within the time window @xmath28sec after the muon came to rest . \"",
    "@xcite in the other measurement of the positive muon lifetime @xcite , which is quoted in review of particle physics @xcite , muons were produced by decaying of pions .",
    "a positive pion beam was stopped in the liquid hydrogen or sulphur target which are known to depolarize the muons rapidly .",
    "therefore , the stopped pions provided an unpolarized and rest muon source and the measurement has nothing to do with the lifetime asymmetry .",
    "by the @xmath0 experiment @xcite , the anomalous magnetic moment of the muons was measured and the muon lifetime in flight in a circular orbit provided an important check on the time dilation effect predicted by the special theory of relativity .",
    "could it also provide an excellent check on the lifetime asymmetry ?    the muon beam is formed from decays ( @xmath29 ) of a secondary pion beam .",
    "since the pion has spin zero , the neutrino and muon must have antiparallel spin vectors .",
    "the positive pions decay in flight and the decay muons project in the forward direction , thus the muons and neutrinos have parallel momentum vectors in the laboratory frame .",
    "the neutrino has negative helicity , so that the positive muons @xmath30 must have positive helicity , i.e. rh polarized , and might be partially polarized .",
    "according to the lifetime asymmetry , eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) , the decay rate of rh polarized positive muons , which are antiparticles , is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the degree of muon polarization and @xmath33 .",
    "however , a muon in the muon storage ring will describe a circular path and meanwhile , owing to its magnetic moment , the muon spin vector will precess about the field direction . because the momentum and the spin vector do not keep  in step \" , the angle , @xmath34 , between them is a function of time and the helicity of muon does not remain constant . here",
    "@xmath35 is the angular frequency difference between the spin precession frequency and the cyclotron frequency .",
    "therefore , the decay rate should be substituted by @xmath36 which is a function of time too .",
    "the decay formula is given by @xmath37 after integrating we obtain @xmath38 in the g-2 experiments , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , therefore we have @xmath43    the exponential term @xmath44 is related to the lifetime asymmetry .",
    "it changes with time in the range @xmath45 and its average value is @xmath46 .",
    "the muon lifetime is a fitted parameter in the @xmath0 experiment .",
    "we can obtain the muon lifetime and its error only if we carry out the fit to the data sets by a function in which @xmath47 is included .",
    "however , @xmath47 is not sensitive to the fitted lifetime because it equals 1 approximately and its change with time is expected to be extremely small .",
    "therefore , the lifetime asymmetry can not yet be found out by the @xmath0 experiment under the condition described above .    in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) and ( [ eq:9 ] ) , we find @xmath48 when @xmath10 and @xmath49 .",
    "however , when @xmath50 , it has a maximum value @xmath51 . under this condition",
    "it might be possible to use the @xmath0 experiment as a test of the lifetime asymmetry .",
    "the lifetime of @xmath5-leptons in flight has been measured by using samples from process @xmath52 @xcite . in these measurements ,",
    "three different techniques , decay length , impact parameter and impact parameter difference , were used .",
    "directly or indirectly , all three methods involved the measurement of an average decay length . as viewed from the measurement of the lifetime asymmetry , however , many problems need to be discussed .    first , the polarization of @xmath5 lepton originating from @xmath1 decay should be concretely analyzed .",
    "the @xmath5 polarization depends on the initial state polarization via angular momentum conservation .",
    "since the initial particle , @xmath1 boson , has spin 1 , its helicity , @xmath53 , can have @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "along or near the incidence direction of electron beam in the collider , @xmath56 and @xmath57 must be both rh polarized when @xmath58 , lh polarized when @xmath59 , and one is rh polarized while another is lh polarized when @xmath60 , according to the conservation law of angular momentum . in first and second situations , the effects of the lifetime asymmetry of positive and negative @xmath5 leptons are counteracted one another . only in third situation , might the effect of the lifetime asymmetry be observed .",
    "in which if @xmath56 is lh polarized and @xmath57 is rh polarized the lifetime of @xmath5 leptons in the laboratory frame will be reduced by a factor of @xmath61 ; by contrast if @xmath56 is rh polarized and @xmath57 is lh polarized the lifetime will be lengthened by a factor of @xmath62 . [ see eqs.([eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) ]    second , the effect of the lifetime asymmetry might be quite small . in some experiments ,",
    "the polarization of @xmath5 leptons produced in @xmath22 decays has been measured and the results showed that @xmath56 was partially lh polarized and @xmath57 was partially rh polarized . however , their polarization data were quite scattered and small as well .",
    "for example , the average polarizations were found to be only @xmath63 @xcite , 0.01 @xcite , 0.24 @xcite and 0.132 @xcite , respectively .",
    "furthermore the average decay length or the lifetime of the @xmath5 leptons would be reduced by a factor of @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , the polarization must be measured precisely , and because it might be quite small the samples should be identified and treated very carefully in the fit .",
    "unfortunately , we are unable to find the information about polarization measurements in the papers of measuring the @xmath5 lifetime .",
    "third , there were some uncertainties in the fitting procedure . in order to obtain the average decay length ,",
    "a maximum likelihood fit was applied to the observed decay length distribution . in these experiments , however , the authenticity of the fitted results is suspicious because the measurement errors are quite big and the samples are selected again and again .",
    "for example , in the l3 experiment only observed decay length values with an error less than 5 mm were accepted for the fit , but the average decay lengths of the fit were 2.245 mm and 2.265 mm , respectively @xcite .",
    "in mac experiment , the fit included only the 532 events having assigned the observed decay length error less than 3 mm , but the average decay length was 0.777 mm @xcite .",
    "obviously , these error values of samples are much greater than the average values of the samples themselves . on the other hand , after each iteration , some samples were removed again @xcite . in the fitting process , for example , about 10 % of the samples were removed @xcite .",
    "it is well known that an input decay length is sensitive to the fitted result and plays an important role in selecting a sample being either accepted or rejected .",
    "if considering the lifetime asymmetry in these experiments , the assigned input decay length might not be reasonable and the removed samples might be important to determine the correct value of an average decay length .",
    "lastly , it is more important that the tau decay is not a pure weak process .",
    "the tau decay is a multiplicity process , not like muon decay , and includes many modes : the purely leptonic decays and the semi - leptonic decays involving both leptons and hadrons .",
    "the branching ratio of the purely leptonic decays is about 35 % ( see ref .",
    "@xcite p.446 and @xcite ) and semi - leptonic decays are sensitive to the strong coupling constant @xcite .",
    "each decay mode makes different contribution to the lifetime and but the lifetime asymmetry is only caused by the weak interactions .    to conclude , these experiments of measuring the @xmath5 lifetime can not prove whether the lifetime asymmetry is correct or not .",
    "the sld collaboration has measured the left - right cross section asymmetry in z boson production by @xmath65 collisions @xcite @xmath66 where @xmath67 refers to the left(right)-handed electron beam polarization .",
    "obviously , only electrons were polarized , while positrons were unpolarized in the processes . parity violation in @xmath1 production from electron - positron collisions gives rise to asymmetrical polarization - dependent cross sections and final state angular distributions . the polarized electron beam at sld allows for asymmetry measurements with two different techniques .",
    "one is a left - right asymmetry , which refers to the cross - section asymmetry for the production of z - bosons by lh and rh electron beams .",
    "this is sensitive to the initial state coupling ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the other involves a forward - backward asymmetry , in which the cross sections are obtained by integrating forward and backward hemipheres separately , along with lh and rh polarized electrons .",
    "this is sensitive to the final state coupling ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "we only discuss the first technique here .",
    "the left - right cross section asymmetry is defined as @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the @xmath65 production cross sections for @xmath1 bosons with lh and rh polarized electron beams , respectively .",
    "they are obtained by integrating over all kinematically allowed final states , i.e. , the entire @xmath73 solid angle @xcite .",
    "the sld collaboration has reported a series of @xmath74 measurements .",
    "the electron beam polarization was measured by the cherenov detector ( ckv ) , polarized gamma counter ( pgc ) and quartz fiber calorimeter ( qfc ) , and the result was about 75% .",
    "the positron beam polarization was directly measured by a m@xmath75ller polarimeter in end station a and the result @xmath76 was consistent with zero .",
    "@xmath74 was measured by counting hadronic and @xmath77 decays of the @xmath1 boson for each of the two longitudinal polarization states of the electron beam .",
    "the sld has collected about 530 k @xmath1 events from 1992 to 1998 and got @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "it is obvious from the experiments that @xmath79 , i.e. , the integrated cross section of lh polarized electron beams is greater than that of rh polarized electron beams .",
    "this result possesses important significance .",
    "many phenomena of parity violation , for example , the asymmetry of the angular distribution of the particles emitted from decay processes and the asymmetry in polarized electron - nucleon scattering , have been observed experimentally .",
    "these phenomena are related to differential cross sections . however , the @xmath74 asymmetry is the phenomenon of parity violation which is related to integrated cross section .",
    "it shows that the integrated cross section of electron - positron weak interactions is depending on the helicity of electron beam and so it is not a lorentz scalar .",
    "this is a veritably experimental truth though it is in conflict with our common sense .",
    "it is due to the weak coupling strength of lh chirality states to the @xmath1 boson being stronger than that of rh chirality states in the neutral weak currents .",
    "this characteristic is much more evident in the charged weak currents , in which there exist only lh chirality states whereas the weak coupling strength of rh chirality states to the @xmath80 boson is equal to zero . since",
    "integrated cross section induced by neutral weak currents is a pseudoscalar , so that induced by charged weak currents should also be a pseudoscalar .",
    "the decay processes are caused by the charged weak currents and the lifetime is the reciprocal of integrated cross section ( i.e. , decay rate ) .",
    "therefore , the lifetime must be a pseudoscalar too .",
    "actually , the lifetime asymmetry means the left - right cross section being asymmetric in the charged weak currents .",
    "it is a logical generalization of the left - right cross section asymmetry in the neutral weak currents .",
    "consequently , in our opinion , the @xmath74 measurement has indirectly proved that the prediction about the left - right polarization - dependent lifetime asymmetry should be correct .",
    "it is noteworthy that slac e158 collaboration has also reported a precision measurement of the parity - violating asymmetry in polarized electron - electron mller scattering @xcite .",
    "the left - right asymmetry was found in the neutral weak current processes mediated by @xmath1 exchange and result showed that the integrated cross section of lh helicity electron is greater than that of rh polarized electron .",
    "therefore , this experiment indirectly proves the lifetime asymmetry again .",
    "to decide unequivocally whether the lifetime asymmetry is correct or not , one must perform some experiments to determine whether lifetime differentiates the right from the left .",
    "a relatively simple possibility is to measure the angular distribution of the electrons or positrons coming from the decays of polarized muons .    in the sm",

    "( [ eq:15 ] ) and ( [ eq:17 ] ) that the angular distributions of electrons and positrons are of the similar form and they always tend to be emitted along the direction which is antiparallel to the muon spin - vector , just like that in nuclear @xmath7 decay . the decay rate asymmetry can be expressed as @xmath106    when @xmath107 , instead of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:15 ] ) and ( [ eq:17 ] ) we obtain @xmath108 obviously , this condition , @xmath107 , would reduce the asymmetries due to angular distribution and then the decay rate asymmetry can also be expressed as @xmath109    all quantities @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 are proportional to the product @xmath114",
    ". they can be obtained by counting electrons or positrons from decays for each of the two longitudinally polarized muon beam .",
    "if these quantities are not equal to zero , one would then have a definite proof of lifetime asymmetry .",
    "the experiments for measuring these quantities might be simpler and easier because these measurements only require one detector to count the numbers of the electrons or positrons .",
    "furthermore , in these measurements nearly no exact knowledge of detector efficiency and background is needed .",
    "of course , the luminosity , polarization and momentum of the muon beam should be precisely measured .",
    "there are the two same characteristics in @xmath74 measurement and lifetime asymmetry one : ( 1 ) the initial states are both polarized ; ( 2 ) the measured quantities are both integrated cross sections",
    ". therefore , these two measurements are entirely similar .",
    "the @xmath74 measurement already shows that @xmath71 and @xmath72 are different .",
    "therefore , the integrated cross section of weak interactions is not invariant under space inversion and so it is not a lorentz scalar .",
    "since the integrated cross section already reveals a left - right asymmetry in the processes caused by neutral weak currents , we can naturally understand the left - right asymmetry in the decay processes caused by charged weak currents .",
    "that is to say , the @xmath74 measurement has already indirectly demonstrated the lifetime asymmetry shown by ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "however , all existing experiments of measuring lifetime can not be employed for testing the lifetime asymmetry and we still need a direct experimental evidence to test one .",
    "the purely leptonic processes obey the pure @xmath81 theory and are the simplest weak interaction processes .",
    "the muon decay , as a typical sample , is always used for researching the theory of weak interactions and also the best selection for testing the lifetime asymmetry . in this paper",
    "it is proposed that the muons must be highly polarized and moving with velocities approaching @xmath115 and along a straight line in order to measure the lifetime asymmetry .",
    "a direct demonstration of the lifetime asymmetry could come true by measuring the differential decay rate asymmetry , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , of the polarized muon beam .",
    "the experiments proposed might prove to be quite feasible .",
    "the prediction of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) is a lowest - order ( tree diagram ) effect in quantum field theory @xcite , not a high - order effect , just like all well - established explanations on parity - violation phenomena .",
    "the left - right asymmetry of lifetime is a new parity violation phenomenon which has never been observed experimentally before .",
    "it implies that the lifetime is by no means a scalar or pseudoscalar not only in four - dimensional space - time but also in three - dimensional space .",
    "why it has been evaded from question since the discovery of parity violation in 1956 - 1957 ? from the theoretical point of view , this is because the spin states and the helicity states are confused .",
    "the spin states are relevant to the essence described by the lagrangian whereas the helicity state is relevant to experimental phenomena . in the calculation of decay rate for a polarized fermion in flight",
    ", we often incorrectly used the spin state which is an eigenstate of a covariant spin operator in four - dimensional space - time so it is essentially an average over two helicity states , yielding the  normal \" lifetime of a rest fermion without left - right asymmetry .",
    "however , a polarized fermion in flight should be described by the helicity eigenstate which can be transformed from left to right one or vice versa in a pure space inversion or lorentz transformation when the observer s velocity exceeds the particle s one .",
    "the experimental test of the lifetime asymmetry would be more interesting and more important :    \\(1 ) it could observe a new parity violation phenomenon that might be overlooked for nearly 50 years .",
    "as mentioned above , the left - right parity - violating asymmetry in the neutral weak current has been precisely measured , but in the charged weak current it has not yet been measured .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) is of the order of @xmath7 , not @xmath118 , so the lifetime asymmetry is not a relativistic effect in the strict sense , but it is a parity violated one",
    ". it might be crucial for further understanding the essence of the weak interactions .",
    "\\(2 ) it would provide a new test of the sm .",
    "the observation of the left - right asymmetry in polarized electron scattering has even caused a discussion about whether the sm is lorentz violated @xcite .",
    "the experimental test of the lifetime asymmetry will further promote the discussion .",
    "moreover , the new prediction of lifetime asymmetry given by formula , eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , also implies a pure @xmath81 type interactions .",

    "the precision measurement of the quantity @xmath121 would tell us about some new interactions like @xmath119 type besides the known @xmath81 type , and allow for exploration of new physics beyond the sm .",
