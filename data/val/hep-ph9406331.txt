    "with the advent of hadron supercolliders , it will be possible to directly test the tri - boson couplings of the @xmath4 , @xmath5 and photon .",
    "indeed , observations of the @xmath3 coupling have been reported from measurements of @xmath6@xcite .",
    "experimental measurements coupled with accurate theoretical predictions could result in the confirmation of the standard model ( sm ) , or alternatively , could point to new physics above the @xmath5 mass scale .",
    "the tri - boson couplings are uniquely constrained in the standard model if the gauge symmetry is @xmath7 , the symmetry breaking sector is given by a minimally coupled , scalar higgs boson , and the theory is renormalizable .",
    "if the higgs boson as described by the sm is not the final word , the possibility exists that the sm is a low energy approximation to a more fundamental theory . in this case ,",
    "non - standard model ( nsm ) effects may modify the tri - boson couplings .",
    "the specific process @xmath8 or @xmath0 production of @xmath9 is of particular interest , in part because of the presence of an amplitude zero . in the parton center of mass frame ,",
    "a zero in the amplitude occurs at a fixed angle between the quark and photon momenta@xcite . in moving from the parton center of mass frame to the hadron collider frame",
    ", the zero translates to a dip in the angular distribution of the photon .",
    "anomalous @xmath3 couplings result in contributions that fill in the zero , making the @xmath9 production process especially sensitive to nonstandard effects at leading order .",
    "this has been explored in the literature by a variety of authors@xcite .",
    "some of these authors treat the anomalous @xmath3 couplings as constants@xcite while others include form factors multiplying the nsm parameters@xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that strong interaction corrections@xcite fill in the dip in the photon angular distribution .",
    "thus , the strong interaction corrections must be well understood before one can claim evidence of new physics .",
    "the next - to - leading order calculation of @xmath10 production , including non - standard couplings , has been performed by baur , han and ohnemus in ref .",
    "however , their estimation of the sensitivities of the fermilab tevatron and supercolliders to nonstandard couplings was done using form factors . in the effective lagrangian approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , however , there are no form factors multiplying the nsm parameters , but neither are strong interaction corrections included . at leading order and next - to - leading order in qcd , the two approaches to incorporating nonstandard couplings ( with and without form factor suppression ) lead to significant differences in @xmath9 production rates for the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the focus of this paper is the comparison of the two approaches , including the @xmath11 corrections , to @xmath12 production at the tevatron and lhc .",

    "these large contributions at @xmath133 would seem to cast doubt on the validity of the perturbative expansion , but are generally caused by the presence of the radiation zero mentioned above , thereby suppressing the photon transverse momentum distributions at ll order@xcite .",

    "<S> the second approach is to ignore such considerations and calculate the contributions to non - standard model tri - boson gauge couplings without such suppressions , the idea being that at sufficiently high energies where new physics occurs , one abandons the low energy effective theory . </S>",
