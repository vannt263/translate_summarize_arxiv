    "astrophysical jets are universal : they appear in myriad forms , exhibiting significant variations in luminosity , collimation and velocity .",
    "relativistic jets have been observed in the context of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , micro - quasars and gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "smaller - scale non - relativistic versions have been observed in a much wider array of systems such as low - mass young stellar objects ( ysos ) , massive x - ray binary systems and protoplanetary nebulae ( ppne ) .",
    "although the word `` jets '' suggests a highly collimated and narrow outflow , diffuse emanations , often termed `` outflows '' , have also been detected in stars in their final stages of evolution .",
    "in addition , our sun exhibits jets and flares , albeit ones that are much smaller than the one mentioned above . in this letter",
    ", we shall refer to jets and their ( relatively ) diffuse cousins as `` outflows '' .",
    "a comprehensive discussion of outflows in astrophysical systems is found in @xcite .",
    "given the diversity of their occurrence and the vastly different parameters that these outflows exhibit , the quest for a broad underlying mechanism that can power these outflows has proven elusive although several seminal works in the 1970s and early 1980s @xcite did highlight the importance of magnetic fields in the generation of these outflows .",
    "subsequent works introduced the magneto - centrifugal mechanism @xcite , magnetic towers @xcite and other mechanisms @xcite , all mediated by the magnetic field , in their attempts to explain the origin of these outflows .",
    "most of the preceding analyses used the ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) model , the simplest and highly explored plasma fluid model .",
    "however , in the last decade , the importance of the hall effect in astrophysical systems has been recognized ; the hall effect has been shown to play a crucial role in several scenarios , such as magnetic braking and star formation @xcite , protostellar discs @xcite and magnetic field evolution in neutron star crusts @xcite .",
    "this recognition comes along with the realization that mhd may be an inadequate framework for generating the observed outflows @xcite .    in order to explore the simultaneous dynamics of magnetic fields and outflows",
    ", one must resort to models more encompassing than mhd . as an illustration",
    ", we will analyze incompressible hall magnetohydrodynamics ( hmhd ) , the simplest `` beyond mhd '' model that captures one crucial two - fluid effect : the hall current , expressing differential electron - ion motion , introduces a fundamental scale length , the ion skin depth ( ideal mhd is scale - free ) that provides a convenient fiduciary length in terms of which one can define ` large scale ' and ` small scale ' quantities .",
    "hmhd assigns assigns equal weights to , and thereby unifies , the magnetic fields and flows in a natural manner , as demonstrated in section [ secii ] .",
    "qualitatively , this can be understood as a consequence of one of the hmhd equations involving a simultaneous evolution of the magnetic field @xmath2 and the fluid vorticity @xmath3 , resulting in the inexorable linking of these two quantities .    in this letter",
    ", we explore what was termed as the ` reverse dynamo ' mechanism ; derived and developed in @xcite .",
    "the mechanism employs hmhd , and exhibits potential universality in generating non - relativistic outflows . the original moniker ` reverse dynamo ' constitutes an inadequate ( and incomplete ) description of the more encompassing process .",
    "though dynamo based approaches have been around since the 1970s @xcite , with several important developments in the subsequent decades @xcite , the dy - rdy approach is conceptually unique as it incorporates the following features :    * the hmhd is the governing model from the outset ( the hall term is not appended to an essentially mhd calculation ) .",
    "consequently the magnetic field and the flows are treated on an entirely equal footing .",
    "the `` dynamo '' designates the creation of long - scale magnetic fields from a short scale ( turbulent ) velocity field , and the `` reverse dynamo '' denotes the complementary / opposite phenomenon of generating long - scale flows from a short scale ( turbulent ) magnetic field .",
    "the hmhd based theory is a unified dy - rdy theory ; both flows and magnetic fields emerge simultaneously from a given source of short scale energy be it kinetic or magnetic .",
    "* unlike mhd , the hmhd has an intrinsic length scale .",
    "thus it becomes possible to characterize long and short scales in a well - defined way .",
    "this will prove to be crucial in estimating the length scale relevant to , for example , the generated outflows .",
    "we begin with a short recapitulation of the formalism derived in @xcite . assuming a constant density ( purely for analytic simplicity ) and equal temperatures for the electrons and ions @xmath4 , the hmhd yields the following evolution equations for the flow and the magnetic field : @xmath5 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\frac{\\partial { \\bf v}}{\\partial t } & = & { \\bf v } \\times \\left(\\nabla \\times { \\bf v}\\right ) + \\left(\\nabla \\times { \\bf b}\\right)\\times { \\bf b } - \\nabla \\left(p+\\frac{v^2}{2}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] wherein @xmath6 , with @xmath7 representing the ion skin depth , which serves as the intrinsic length scale characteristic of hmhd .",
    "@xmath8 represents a characteristic scale length to be specified shortly hereafter . in ( [ basiceq ] ) ,",
    "the magnetic field is normalized to an arbitrary representative magnetic field @xmath9 , the velocity to the corresponding alfven velocity @xmath10 , the length scale to @xmath8 and the timescale to @xmath11 .",
    "subsequently , we choose @xmath8 to be the ion skin depth , as we are interested in the underlying microscopic physics .",
    "thus , we observe that @xmath7 _ will no longer appear explicitly _ , i.e , @xmath12 .",
    "with such a choice of units , one may re - express ( [ basiceq ] ) as a pair of vorticity - like equations @xcite : @xmath13 where the vorticities @xmath14 and the associated velocities @xmath15 are @xmath16 the structure of the above equations is radically different from that of ideal mhd , and is also indicative why @xmath2 and @xmath17 @xmath18 are generated in tandem .",
    "notice that the governing equation for the canonical vorticity @xmath19 treats the magnetic field and the vorticity on par .",
    "there are two conserved helicities in the system : the magnetic helicity @xmath20 and the canonical helicity @xmath21 ; the latter is essentially the ion helicity reflecting the ( finite ) ion inertia . unlike in ideal mhd , the cross helicity , @xmath22 , is no longer conserved .",
    "the velocity and magnetic fields are decomposed into the equilibrium seed fields ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) and the fluctuations ; the latter , in turn , comprising of the macroscopic ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) and microscopic ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) components : @xmath29 it is important to realize that the fluctuations are comprised of both macroscopic and microscopic components . the former yield non - zero expressions upon carrying out a suitable ensemble or spatial averaging , whilst linear combinations of the latter yield no contributions . over a microscopic scale",
    ", we also assume that the large scale fluctuations do not vary significantly , i.e. that their derivatives vanish .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed discussion of the closure scheme , and its accompanying assumptions .",
    "the equilibrium fields are the energy reservoir for driving the fluctuations .",
    "a comment regarding the length scales is in order . the only intrinsic scale is defined by the normalizing length , the ion skin depth .",
    "any macroscopic length scale of interest is way bigger than @xmath7 , but there is some latitude in what could be called the microscopic length . the latter ( microscopic length )",
    "is taken to be any length that is on the order of , or smaller than , the ion skin depth @xmath7 ( or of order unity and less in normalized units ) .",
    "the equilibrium fields are small scale ( microscopic ) , have been produced by some microscopic process , undergone saturation , and have built up an energy reservoir that will drive the large scale ( macroscopic and observable ) and small scale ( microscopic ) fluctuations .    given that one has little information about the _ equilibrium _ fields , one makes the most ` natural ' choice in the context of hall mhd ; the double beltrami equilibria , described in @xcite . the double beltrami equilibria are the solutions of @xmath30 which , along with the bernoulli condition + @xmath31 constitute the stationary solutions of ( [ basiceq ] ) .",
    "the constants @xmath32 and @xmath33 , set by the helicities of the system @xcite , define two ( dimensionless ) inverse scale lengths @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "appropriate tuning of @xmath32 and @xmath33 can lead to vastly separated roots , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ; the former ( latter ) represents the microscopic ( macroscopic ) _ inverse _ scale length .",
    "such a choice is physically meaningful - the astrophysical systems are macroscopic , but their underlying physics may have a substantial microscopic component .",
    "in fact , we could assume that the ambient fields are entirely microscopic ; this is again a rational assumption since the underlying reservoir that generates observable ( macroscopic ) phenomena is , indeed , presumed to be microscopic .    with these assumptions and a great deal of algebra @xcite ,",
    "one derives the final equations for the macroscopic fluctuations : @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , given by @xmath41,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are determined by @xmath42 , representing the normalized ambient magnetic energy , and by the scale lengths set by the microscopic helicities ; the entire macroscopic dynamics is controlled by the ambient microscopic dynamics . by manipulating the equations in ( [ hugov ] ) , we find that @xmath43 thus , by solving the first equation in ( [ hugov ] ) , we can fully determine @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the details of the solution can be found in @xcite .",

    "the outflows are modeled as originating from the central star , which possesses specifications akin to the sun .",
    "an upper bound on the large scale magnetic field in ppne was obtained in @xcite , and the typical jet velocities in ppne were taken from @xcite .",
    "the rest of the parameters are presented in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "equation [ uhrel ] is the most potent and revealing statement of the unified dynamo - the simultaneous generation of large scale magnetic fields and flows out of a short - scale reservoir of kinetic and magnetic energy .",
    "the dominant dynamo @xmath47 or the dominant reverse dynamo @xmath48 state are simply the two limiting cases of the same mechanism .",
    "what mix of @xmath49 and @xmath50 will finally emerge depends upon the coefficients @xmath40 , @xmath39,and @xmath38 , which are in turn determined by @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the latter duo are also manifest in the scale lengths , namely @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the helicity measures , in turn , reflect the initial state of the system , in particular , the ratio of the ambient kinetic energy to the ambient magnetic energy .",
    "no matter what their ratio , the flows and the magnetic fields are generated together ; the hmhd is a theory of the unified dynamo - reverse dynamo ( dy - rdy ) process .",
    "simple algebra reveals that for @xmath53 , the short scale reservoir is mostly magnetic , @xmath54 leading to strong ( compared to magnetic fields ) macroscopic flows @xmath55 .",
    "this limit pertains only to those systems where the observed flows are super - alfvnic .",
    "the standard dynamo scenario pertains to the opposite case : @xmath56 , implying the microscopic relation @xmath57 , and the macroscopic relation @xmath58 .",
    "this deterministic relationship between the energy mix in the short scale reservoir , and the consequent long scale observables is one of the major results of the paper .",
    "the theory has provided a probe into the earlier era microphysics ; measuring the long range fields and flows yields information about the source that caused them .",
    "let us explore a little further the regime where rdy part of dy - rdy will be dominant .",
    "we will examine the relevant relation @xmath59 in physical units .",
    "since @xmath60 and @xmath61 are normalized by @xmath9 and @xmath62 ( with constant @xmath63 ) , we find that @xmath64 hence , the inverse ( dimensionless ) microscopic scale length @xmath65 turns out to be approximately equal to the large scale alfvn mach number @xmath0 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are , respectively , the ( dimensional ) large scale flow and alfvn velocities . equation ( [ machl ] ) captures the very essence of this analysis , as it directly ties together the microscopic and macroscopic physics .",
    "this is also seen in ( [ uhrel ] ) , as it relates @xmath68 ( microscopic ) with @xmath69 ( macroscopic ) . in our subsequent discussion",
    ", we drop the overbars and note that all quantities on the rhs of ( [ machl ] ) are large scale and dimensional .",
    "the reverse dynamo mechanism , favored by the ordering @xmath53 ( @xmath70 ) , will operate exactly in those regimes where the observed @xmath46 is much greater than unity .",
    "equivalently , if the observed large scale flows are highly super - alfvnic , then it is quite likely that they are generated via the reverse dynamo mechanism .",

    "[ fig1 ] corresponds to a fixed value of @xmath75 , and allows us to probe the ranges of @xmath63 and @xmath78 for which the reverse dynamo may be operational . in the regions lying above and on the curve , rdy will dominate and generate large scale outflows , while in the regions below the curves , the rdy will be sub - dominant .    in table",
    "[ tab1 ] , the computed alfvn mach numbers are displayed for a variety of astrophysical systems . the computations should be accepted with the following caveats :    * the magnetic fields @xmath79 in the large scale outflows can not be easily measured , and hence we have chosen to use the magnetic fields present in the ` engine ' ( driving the outflows ) as a substitute . however , since most of the values of @xmath46 are very high , it is reasonable to suppose that reducing the magnetic field by several orders of magnitude may still plant the system firmly in the regime where the reverse dynamo mechanism determines the outcome . * the magnetic fields in both the ` engine ' and the outflows are both very complex , and the alfvn mach number serves only as a simplified criterion for evaluating the validity of the reverse dynamo mechanism . in addition",
    ", it is known that the winds in grbs , microquasars and pulsars are relativistic , and a fully consistent treatment must take such effects into account .",
    "we plan to present a relativistic version in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the alfvn mach numbers , displayed in table [ tab1 ] , are all very high - much greater than unity .",
    "the simplest criterion that such outflows may originate in a rdy mechanism is amply satisfied .",
    "it must be borne in mind that this does not necessarily imply the operation of the rdy mechanism .",
    "nevertheless , this simple criterion can help us probe the nature of the underlying source that drives large scale outflows and magnetic fields .",
    "an example in contrast is the solar wind , a highly sub - alfvnic outflow ; the rdy is not likely to be the primary driver .",
    "however , we note that there are regions in the chromosphere where the rdy has been shown to play a key role @xcite .",
    "lastly , we note that the hmhd is a theory of unified dy - rdy mechanism - the general theory is just as valid in scenarios where @xmath80 . even in this sub - alfvnic regime , the flows , along with the dominant magnetic fields , will continue to amplify as long as there is turbulent energy to drive them .",
    "both fields grow at the rate determined by the dispersion relation , @xmath81 @xcite with @xmath38 given by ( [ qrs ] ) .",
    "one expects the outflow level to be boosted over time , albeit in a sub - alfvnic setting , until it is compatible with observations .",
    "in this letter , we have explored the unified dynamo - reverse dynamo mechanism within an hmhd model .",
    "the rdy ( dy ) , operates preferentially when the magnetic component ( the kinetic component ) accounts for the bulk of the short scale energy reservoir .",
    "the end product of dominant rdy ( dy ) is a super alfvnic ( sub alfvnic ) outflow , where the alfvn mach number obeys @xmath82 @xmath83 .",
    "consequently , if the observed large scale outflows were to satisfy @xmath82 @xmath83 , they may indicate the operation of a reverse dynamo ( dynamo ) mechanism .",
    "a knowledge of @xmath46 as per this model can serve as a probe of the `` content '' of the underlying ambient reservoir .",
    "the unified dy - rdy mechanism is characterized by a striking reciprocity between the micro and the macro scales : the ambient ( microscopic ) alfvn mach number , denoted by @xmath84 , precisely equals @xmath85 - the _ inverse _ alfvn mach number of the large scale ( macroscopic ) outflow .",
    "we have also found that the reverse dynamo mechanism may operate in a wide variety of astrophysical objects whose ambient density @xmath63 and the large scale magnetic fields @xmath71 lie in the ranges delineated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and table [ tab1 ] .",
    "we do not claim that the rdy mechanism is the sole source of super - alfvnic outflows .",
    "instead , we emphasize the importance of the large scale alfvn mach number @xmath46 as a means of gauging the composition of the ambient magnetic and kinetic energies of the reservoir .",
    "however , our analysis is not exhaustive ; some of the inherent limitations were outlined earlier .",
    "we must stress that the hall term , which introduces an intrinsic micro - scale , and thereby opens up the possibility of physics at disparate macros and micro scales , is an essential enabler of the unified dy - rdy theory .",
    "this step , however , represents only the tip of the iceberg as hall mhd , itself , is the simplest of the extended mhd models .",
    "a natural extension of the formalism presented in this paper involves the construction of an extended mhd and/or two - fluid unified dy - rdy that can capture the non - ideal mhd effects in a more direct manner . to understand relativistic flows",
    ", we must resort to relativistic mhd @xcite or the coupled relativistic magnetofluid model @xcite . for incompressible hall mhd",
    ", we hypothesize that the results are likely to remain similar under @xmath86 in the relativistic regime .",
    "lastly , we note that the assumption of homogeneity can also be relaxed without difficulty , and the ensuing model is still easily solvable via computational means .",
    "the unified dy - rdy mechanism presented herein ( and/or one of its several suggested extensions ) constitutes a very viable candidate , as well as a strong indicator , for generating large scale outflows in a wide range of astrophysical systems .",
