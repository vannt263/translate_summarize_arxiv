    "in a previous publication @xcite we considered emergent modulus fields on mass vortices in systems similar to the ginzburg - landau description of superfluid @xmath0he - b . in that work we provided a method for determining the type and number of moduli appearing on mass vortices under the restriction that the @xmath3 matrix order parameter contained only its diagonal @xmath4 and antisymmetric off - diagonal @xmath5 elements , setting its symmetric - traceless part to zero",
    "although this restriction was not necessarily experimentally sound , it allowed the calculations to be carried out with relative ease while still providing enough complexity to illustrate the development of non - abelian moduli and their interactions with the already well studied translational moduli ( kelvin modes ) @xcite .",
    "the presentation of that work was also purely classical and we made no attempt to discuss time dependence or quantization , which may alter the number of gapless excitations determined from the modulus fields . in this work",
    "we aim to continue that analysis and discuss vortex solutions that are more closely related to certain types of vortices studied both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite in superfluid @xmath0he - b",
    ". specifically we will discuss vortices respecting an axial @xmath1 symmetry , which we will define below .",
    "superfluid @xmath0he has drawn much attention from the high - energy physics community due to its non - abelian group structure and the tensorial nature of its order parameter @xcite .",
    "the topological excitations derived from the group structure share many close similarities to the non - perturbative solutions from yang - mills theories . indeed the analysis of the symmetry breaking in superfluid @xmath0he results in a low energy field theory describing the dynamics of gapless excitations of the mass vortices that is similar in form to the low energy description of flux - tubes presenting abrikosov - nielsen - olesen ( ano ) @xcite string - like solitons in yang - mills theories @xcite . in particular , when the phenomenological @xmath2 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 parameters satisfy certain constraints ( e.g. @xmath8 ) the moduli excitations follow a variation of the ano string excitations .",
    "the low energy sector of the vortex excitations is composed of a translational modulus field part resulting in kelvin excitations , as well as an internal non - abelian part , which typically appears in the form of an o(3 ) sigma model @xcite . additionally , when @xmath9 are small the pattern by which certain moduli develop mass gaps is similar to the case of the ano string where lorentz symmetry breaking terms in the lagrangian generate mass gaps for the non - abelian modes @xcite .",
    "this example is of course illustrating the universality of low energy effective field theories in condensed matter , high energy , and cosmological systems @xcite .",
    "we hasten to mention that the requirements of @xmath10 are different from the values in superfluid @xmath0he approximated from the weak coupling bcs theory as @xmath11 with strong coupling corrections that have been calculated in @xcite . in this sense",
    "we are discussing only systems similar to the ginzburg - landau description of superfluid @xmath0he , however we are not strictly adhering to the descriptions given from condensed matter theory and experiment . thus the results we obtain should be taken only as illustration , and should not necessarily be considered for experimental value .",
    "we however point out that the prescription of @xmath8 can be approximately achieved in an ultra - cold fermi gas with p - wave pairing .",
    "this of course is not the case for superfluid @xmath0he .",
    "the symmetry structure of superfluid @xmath0he can be determined by considering the microscopic bcs theory of the helium atoms at the critical temperature . below this critical temperature the individual helium atoms",
    "condense into cooper pairs similar to the bcs description of superconductivity @xcite .",
    "however , for the case of @xmath0he the short range hard core potential requires the @xmath0he atoms to pair in an orbital p - wave . to preserve the antisymmetric pairing requirement for fermions the cooper pairs form a spin triplet state .",
    "thus the order parameter describing the superfluid states is given by a complex @xmath3 matrix @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 describe the spin and orbital degrees of freedom respectively @xcite .",
    "the continuous group describing the internal symmetry structure of superfluid @xmath0he is thus given by @xmath15 where the @xmath16 represents the phase symmetry of the order parameter , and the groups @xmath17 and @xmath18 represents the symmetries of the spin and orbital degrees of freedom respectively .",
    "this is in addition to the translational symmetries as well as the discrete time reversal and parity symmetries . as we will see below it",
    "will be necessary to distinguish between internal orbital rotations and external coordinate rotations ( see the example in @xcite ) . by external coordinate rotation",
    ", we are referring to a transformation resulting from a rotation of the coordinate system without a corresponding rotation to the orbital index .",
    "we will consider the orbital index as an internal degree of freedom .",
    "this distinction is important for the case of @xmath8 since in this limit the free energy gradient terms receive an enhanced symmetry @xmath19 .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of the theory of elasticity where an unphysical vanishing of the bulk modulus leads to an enhanced symmetry of rotations @xmath20 leading to the equivalence of scale and conformal transformations @xcite . in this work",
    "it will be necessary to consider the entire symmetry group including both the internal and external symmetries ( see figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "rotation would rotate both the density function and the directors . ]",
    "there are several potential phases of the superfluid ground state , which are determined by considerations of the broken symmetries .",
    "in particular the b phase is characterized by the spontaneous breaking of @xmath21 to a spin - orbit locked phase @xmath22 similar to the mechanism of color - flavour locking in color superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the degeneracy of the b phase ground state is given by @xmath23 this type of degeneracy allows for the existence of topologically stable vortices of the @xmath24 type @xcite .",
    "the specific vortex solutions are determined by minimizing the ginzburg - landau free energy for the required boundary conditions .    to accomplish this task we consider several forms of the order parameter and minimize the free energy under those assumptions .",
    "previously the vortex order parameters were searched for by initially decomposing the order parameter into its trace , symmetric , and antisymmetric components @xcite @xmath25 } \\equiv \\varepsilon_{\\mu i k}\\chi^k .",
    "\\label{completedecomposition}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the illustrative purposes in the previous work @xcite it was sufficient to consider just the trace and antisymmetric components of the order parameter @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the coordinates in the plane perpendicular to the vortex axis , and @xmath28 is the polar angle in this plane .",
    "the functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 are determined by minimizing the free energy .",
    "this is indeed the most simple context allowing for the maximal number of modulus fields to emerge on the vortex . in the present work",
    "we wish to continue that analysis by extending the order parameter ansatz to include all the necessary components appearing in an axially symmetric solution",
    ". these will include new symmetric - traceless components . in the absence of these terms",
    "the low energy effective theory can be described by translations ( kelvin modes ) and rotations of the @xmath31 fields resulting in an emergent @xmath32 sigma model for the unit vector @xmath33 describing the director of @xmath31 .",
    "the symmetric terms will however complicate this situation since the symmetric components must be built from symmetric traceless combinations of the products @xmath34 whereas the antisymmetric components are simply built from @xmath35 .",
    "we will find that this addition does not change the number of moduli appearing on the mass vortex .",
    "however , we will observe changes to the gradient and interaction terms involved .",
    "the other goal of this paper will be to characterize the time dependence of the modulus fields to determine the quantized modes appearing on the mass vortex .",
    "it is well known that after quantization the two translational moduli appearing on the vortex solution result in a single kelvin mode . this is the result of the application of goldstone s theorem @xcite to non - relativistic systems where the number of quantized modes is less than or equal to the number of broken group generators @xcitehe - a @xcite",
    ", however we will not need to consider this effect in the present work . ] .",
    "additionally , it is a simple matter to show that the moduli generated by the broken coordinate rotational symmetry @xmath36 are equivalent to the @xmath37 translations due to the so called inverse higgs mechanism @xcite .",
    "figure 3 illustrates this equivalence .",
    "thus the four moduli generated from coordinate rotations and translations reduce to only one gapless mode .",
    "we will extend this analysis to the quantization of the non - abelian modulus fields appearing from the broken @xmath38 .",
    "-dependent translations is illustrated above . here",
    "the translation @xmath39 is a linear function of @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the corresponding rotation angle .",
    "this effect is known as the inverse higgs mechanism @xcite . ]",
    "the organization of our presentation is as follows .",
    "we will begin with a brief review of the ginzburg - landau description of superfluid @xmath0he , and discuss the emergence of topological vortices in the bulk b phase .",
    "the following section will present a classification of vortices , where we will determine the general form of the order parameter for an axially symmetric vortex .",
    "in particular we will determine some specific requirements for the axially symmetric components to emerge from the trace - only solution .",
    "in the following sections we will determine the static low energy theory describing the translational and non - abelian modulus fields localized on the mass vortex with the modifications due to the symmetric components of the axially symmetric vortex . finally , we will characterize the precise number and type of quantized gapless modes appearing on the axial vortex by considering the goldstone theorem in non - relativistic systems .",
    "although we will discuss the effects of quantization on the classically gapless modes , we will not discuss quantum corrections coming from loops in the effective potential .",
    "for such an analysis we turn the reader to the discussion presented in @xcite .",
    "in this section we will review the ginzburg - landau description of condensed matter systems following the descriptions outlined in @xcite .",
    "the ginzburg - landau theory provides a macroscopic description of the order parameter of superfluid @xmath0he near the critical temperature .",
    "the theory can be derived from consideration of the microscopic bcs theory of the p - wave cooper pairs of the @xmath0he atoms resulting in a non - relativistic field theory of the order parameter . as we discussed in the introduction",
    "the order parameter is a complex @xmath3 matrix that transforms as a vector under both spin and orbital rotations @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are spin and orbital rotations respectively .",
    "the symmetry group describing these transformations is @xmath45 where @xmath16 is the group of phase rotations @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are the groups of spin and orbital rotations .",
    "the most general ( time - dependent ) ginzburg - landau free energy containing this symmetry is given by @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath7 , @xmath6 , and @xmath2 are phenomenological parameters whose values can be determined at zero pressure from the bcs theory @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "strong coupling corrections for the specific case of superfluid @xmath0he have been determined in @xcite .",
    "however , we quickly point out that in the present paper we will adjust the constants at our will depending on the particular features we wish to illustrate",
    ". the time - dependent part @xmath51 of ( [ glfe ] ) is typically discussed for non - equilibrium dynamics where quasi - static approximations are not valid ( see for example @xcite and @xcite ) .    in this work",
    "we will mostly consider the case where @xmath10 where we may distinguish internal and external orbital rotations @xmath52 .",
    "this can be theoretically achieved for ultra - cold fermion p - wave pairs , however this requirement does not hold for general systems .",
    "thus our results below will be somewhat illustrative only , and should not necessarily be considered for precise measurements .    minimizing the free energy ( [ glfe ] ) results in several different vacua ,",
    "two of which are achieved physically in superfluid @xmath0he .",
    "these are the a - phase and the b - phase .",
    "we will focus our attention on the b - phase vacuum , which is given by the retention of a spin - orbit locked @xmath53 symmetry @xmath54 the order parameter in the b - phase is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a generic rotation matrix and the gap parameter @xmath57 is determined by minimization of ( [ glfe ] ) . here and throughout this analysis we will make use of the shorthand notation @xmath58 we can see that the order parameter ( [ opb ] ) is invariant under simultaneous orbital @xmath44 and spin @xmath43 rotations satisfying @xmath59 .    in the b",
    "- phase the free energy ( [ glfe ] ) has a ground state degeneracy @xmath60 we may thus select the state with @xmath61 as our ground state . considering the first fundamental group of the degeneracy space ( [ degeneracyspace ] ) @xmath62 we see that the b - phase admits topologically stable mass vortices with integer topological charge @xmath63 .",
    "additionally , spin vortices with @xmath64 winding @xmath65 also appear in the vacuum .",
    "we will only consider the mass vortices with windings @xmath66 and @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the precise form of the single vortex @xmath68 order parameter must be determined by minimization of the free energy ( [ glfe ] ) . for this purpose we will consider solutions of the form @xmath69 where @xmath29 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 are functions to be determined by minimization . here",
    "@xmath28 refers to the polar angle about the vortex axis . to satisfy the asymptotic b phase condition we must require @xmath72",
    "additionally , @xmath29 must vanish as @xmath73 to satisfy the winding condition at the origin .",
    "in addition , far from the vortex center @xmath74 both @xmath75 and @xmath71 will be required to vanish to satisfy the b phase vacuum constraint .",
    "in this section we will discuss the topic of vortex classification by considering the symmetries broken by specific vortex solutions .",
    "the results of this section will allow us to determine vortex solutions by reducing the number of components of the order parameter to those that satisfy invariance under unbroken symmetries . additionally , by simply considering the broken generators we will be able to determine the modulus fields emerging on the mass vortex , and draw general conclusions about their kinetic terms and interactions in a low energy effective theory .",
    "the presentation of this section will follow closely the approaches given in @xcite .    for the moment we will set @xmath8 and consider the complete symmetry group @xmath76 of the free energy ( [ glfe ] ) , which includes both the continuous symmetries from @xmath21 as well as the coordinate translational and the discrete symmetries .",
    "in addition @xmath76 includes the enhanced symmetry distinguishing internal and external orbital rotations @xmath52 .",
    "we may split @xmath76 into its continuous and discrete groups @xmath77 where @xmath78 here @xmath79 represents the translational symmetry , @xmath80 represents rotations of the coordinate . the generator @xmath81 will henceforth refer to the rotations of the orbital index of the order parameter .",
    "the discrete symmetries @xmath82 and @xmath83 represent time reversal and parity transformations . the effect of these transformations on the order parameter @xmath12 are given by the following @xmath84 in the first line of ( [ transformations ] ) @xmath85 represents the phase angle .",
    "we will employ the shorthand notations @xmath86 in the b - phase vacuum state where we may select for our ground state @xmath87 we can see that the preserved continuous symmetries from @xmath76 are @xmath88 as well as discrete symmetries given by the transformations @xmath89    in the presence of a vortex in the b - phase the determination of the continuous symmetries preserved in the asymptotic limit is somewhat more subtle . far away from the vortex",
    "core the order parameter approaches the form @xmath90 clearly the asymptotic vacuum form retains the spin - orbit locking @xmath91 symmetry as well as invariance under translations @xmath92 .",
    "it is also not difficult to show that coordinate rotations about the @xmath93 and @xmath94 axis also leave the order parameter invariant in the asymptotic limit .",
    "however , it is clear that the order parameter is not invariant under independent phase and external coordinate rotations about the @xmath40-axis .",
    "instead the order parameter is invariant under axial @xmath95 transformations generated by a linear combination of the generators of phase and @xmath40-axis external coordinate rotations : @xmath96 a specific example of an axial transformation generated by @xmath97 is shown in figure 4 .",
    "symmetric vortex solution are mapped onto the perpendicular plane to the vortex axis .",
    "the two transformations generated by @xmath98 and @xmath99 are shown in the upper right and lower left corner respectively . performing these transformations in succession by equal and opposite angle @xmath100",
    "are known as axial @xmath95 transformations generated by @xmath97 for which axially symmetric solutions are invariant as illustrated in the lower right corner . ]",
    "the linear combinations of @xmath97 with @xmath101 and @xmath102 generate a coordinate - phase locked ( axial ) symmetry @xmath103 , which contains @xmath95 as a subgroup . thus summarizing the continuous symmetries of the b",

    "the degeneracy space associated with a particular mass vortex solutions is characterized by the possible symmetry breaking pattern of the continuous group ( [ casymvort ] ) .",
    "clearly the existence of a vortex core breaks translations in the @xmath93 and @xmath94 directions as well as rotations about any axis in the @xmath108 plane .",
    "additionally , vortex solutions are invariant under translations in the @xmath40 direction .",
    "vortex solutions are thus classified according to their transformation properties under the group @xmath109 whose continuous group elements are generated by @xmath97 , @xmath110 , with discrete group elements given in ( [ dasymvort ] ) .      in searching for vortex solutions that minimize the free energy",
    ", we may consider forms of the order parameter that break some or all of the symmetries in ( [ classgroup ] ) .",
    "in this light it is most convenient to expand the vortex solution in terms of eigenfunctions of @xmath97 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 .",
    "@xmath113 where the @xmath114 eigenfunctions written in the cartesian @xmath115 basis as @xmath116    the most trivial example of a solution is a vortex that is axially @xmath95 symmetric and invariant under @xmath91 @xmath117 in this case the solution is constrained to @xmath118 , as well as @xmath119 , with @xmath120 , and all other @xmath121 vanish .",

    "this would represent the trace - only vortex solution @xmath124    a more interesting ansatz occurs when we consider solutions that are invariant under a locked @xmath125 symmetry , which is a subgroup of the classification group ( [ classgroup ] ) and is generated by @xmath126 this results in the constraint @xmath127 , and thus we may express the amplitudes @xmath128 as @xmath129 the @xmath130 vortices are further categorized by their transformations under the @xmath122 .",
    "this results in five subclasses of axisymmetric vortices .",

    "following this procedure may write the antisymmetric and symmetric - traceless parts of the order parameter @xmath12 as follows @xmath134 where we write the @xmath75 and @xmath71 tensors in terms of the spherical tensor components @xmath135 and @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138    the following relations between the @xmath133 and @xmath139 bases are useful and easy to derive from the clebsch - gordon coefficients : @xmath140    in the context of superfluid @xmath0he - b the solutions ( [ axisymmetric ] ) are known as the @xmath141-vortices @xcite , and are characterized by a core with mixed a - phase @xmath142 and ferromagnetic @xmath143-phase @xmath144 components . in the following section we will argue that these components will typically arise spontaneously from the trace only solution ( [ traceonly ] ) and thus the vortex will contain symmetric and anti - symmetric components resulting in additional gapless excitations of the vortex core .",
    "in a previous work we considered the conditions under which a single real antisymmetric component @xmath145 of the vortex order parameter would spontaneously develop in the core from the initial trace - only solution ( [ traceonly ] ) . to accomplish that task we employed the methods of @xcite considered for superconducting strings . initially , the @xmath70 field is set to zero and the free energy ( [ glfe ] ) is minimized numerically by @xmath123 ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "is plotted .",
    "here we have defined @xmath146 . for @xmath147",
    "the solution follows the form @xmath148 . in the opposite limit",
    "@xmath149 the function @xmath150 . ]    at this point a small @xmath151 field is considered in the free energy ( [ glfe ] ) such that the quartic terms of @xmath70 may be neglected .",

    ".    we may take this analysis one step further by considering a more general ansatz for @xmath70 , which satisfies the @xmath125 axial symmetry condition : @xmath160 the stability is determined by considering the equations of motion linearized in @xmath161 @xmath162 considering the case far from the vortex core a non - trivial solution to the coupled equations ( [ coupledequations ] ) exists for any @xmath2 with the asymptotic condition @xmath163 near the vortex core it is clear that @xmath164 due to the winding .",
    "however , the field @xmath165 is not constrained at the origin by any winding and thus may develop a non - trivial value in the core .",
    "this value must be determined by solving the full equations of motion .",
    "numerical solutions for @xmath166 are shown in figure 6 for a typical set of @xmath2 values .",
    "having demonstrated the spontaneous emergence of antisymmetric components @xmath165 and",
    "@xmath167 , we continue the analysis by considering symmetric - traceless components as perturbations on the antisymmetric solution . for this",
    "we consider the symmetric ansatz @xmath168 considering the equations of motion linearized in @xmath169 and @xmath170 we arrive at @xmath171 where for our purposes it will only be necessary to consider the first terms on the righthand side of ( [ coupledsymmequations ] ) .",
    "it is readily apparent that non - zero @xmath166 fields act as sources for the symmetric - traceless fields @xmath172 .",
    "numerical solutions for @xmath172 are shown in figure 7 .",
    "thus all four off diagonal fields @xmath161 and @xmath173 spontaneously develop from the trace - only solution ( [ traceonly ] ) .",
    "the remaining four elements of the axial solution ( numerically plotted in figure 8) also arise spontaneously from ( [ traceonly ] ) due to their couplings with the symmetric @xmath173 and antisymmetric @xmath161 solutions .",

    "having established the spontaneous emergence of non - trace elements of the @xmath104 vortex order parameter we may proceed to address the effective field theory describing the gapless excitations of the vortex string . at the classical level this can be accomplished by determining the broken symmetries of a particular vortex solution .",
    "the number of broken symmetries determines the number of gapless moduli appearing in the low energy theory . for relativistic systems",
    "this is precisely the number of quantized goldstone modes appearing in the effective theory .",
    "however , for non - relativistic systems , the goldstone theorem is more subtle and care must be taken to determine how many gapless modes survive the quantization procedure . in this section",
    "we will simply discuss the classical moduli determined from symmetry considerations and determine the classical effective theory . in the following section we will consider quantization .",
    "in section 4 we discussed that at large distances from the vortex core , the order parameter was required to be invariant under the continuous symmetry group ( [ casymvort ] ) @xmath183 the moduli generating gapless modes for a particular vortex solution are determined from the broken generators of the group ( [ casymvort ] ) .",
    "in particular , all vortex lines break the translational symmetries in the @xmath108 plane resulting in two abelian moduli generating the kelvin excitations .",
    "additionally , vortex solutions that break the axial @xmath95 symmetry generate an additional abelian mode .",
    "we may also consider the coordinate rotations about the @xmath93 and @xmath94 axes , which would naively be expected to generate two additional moduli .",
    "however , it is a simple matter to show that the coordinate rotations about the @xmath93 and @xmath94 directions are equivalent to a @xmath40-dependent translation in the @xmath184 plane .",
    "thus , there are a total of three potential abelian moduli arising on the vortex string .",

    "we begin by considering fluctuations of the vortex line given by @xmath210 inserting ( [ fluctuations ] ) into the free energy ( [ glfe ] ) and expanding to second order in @xmath211 we obtain upon integrating by parts in the spatial gradients @xmath212 where we have consolidated the spatial gradient and potential terms into @xmath213 . at this point",
    "we consider an adiabatic mode expansion for @xmath214 @xmath215 where the functions @xmath216 are eigenfunctions of @xmath217 @xmath218 in the low energy approximation we may restrict the expansion ( [ expansion ] ) to eigenfunctions @xmath216 for which @xmath219 is small compared to the free energy density of the unperturbed vortex solution .",
    "for the current problem we are interested specifically in the zero - modes for which @xmath220 .",
    "these modes are generated by the non - trivial symmetry transformations of @xmath221 that leave free energy invariant .",
    "for each broken generator we parameterize the associated transformation of the vortex solution by a modulus @xmath222 , and consider the family of equivalent vortex solutions @xmath223 and define the ground state solution as @xmath224 .",
    "the gapless fluctuations are thus generated by the modulus fields @xmath222 varying in space and time .",
    "specifically for the adiabatic approximation @xmath225 and the gapless fluctuations are given by @xmath226    inserting ( [ gaplessfluctuations ] ) into ( [ eft ] ) and integrating over @xmath227 we arrive at a low energy effective field theory of gapless excitations localized on the mass vortex .",
    "if the moduli we consider are strictly gapless we will find the free energy can be written as @xmath228 where @xmath229 is a function of the modulus fields @xmath222 .",
    "we hasten to point out that the functions @xmath230 in ( [ generallowe ] ) are symbolic in the sense that their particular form depends on how the indices @xmath231 , and @xmath232 are paired .",
    "the second term of @xmath233 in ( [ generallowe ] ) describes the energy expense from fluctuations of the moduli from the broken generators . to study the classical theory",
    "this is all that is required .",
    "the first term is the dynamical term , which must be considered to determine the number of independent gapless propagating excitations emerging from the modulus fields . for lorentz invariant systems",
    "the corresponding dynamical term ( which would include two time derivatives ) would show that the number of quantized gapless modes is precisely given by the number of broken generators .",
    "however , for a non - relativistic system , the goldstone theorem is more subtle .",
    "the simplest example of a non - relativistic system includes two modulus fields ( such as the translational moduli ) @xmath234 and @xmath235 where @xmath236 . in this case",
    "the time dependent part of the free energy assumes the form @xmath237 in this case the modulus fields are the conjugate momenta of each other and thus form a single goldstone mode with quadratic dispersion , which we will refer to as a type a mode .    on the other hand",
    "if @xmath238 the diagonal terms proportional to @xmath239 in the effective free energy are total derivatives at quadratic order and thus are non - dynamical . in such cases where @xmath240 a more careful consideration of the interactions of @xmath241 with non - zero modes is required",
    "typically this results in an effective theory of  relativistic \" goldstone modes with linear dispersion .",
    "the modes are known as bogoliubov modes , which we will call type b. both type a and b goldstone modes appear in the effective theories of the gapless excitations on mass vortices .",
    "we hasten to point out that the bogoliubov modes we discuss can not always be considered as low energy excitations as their dispersion relations depend on the interaction with non - zero mode ( gapped ) fluctuations .",
    "if the gap parameter associated with the non - zero mode is high , the propagation velocity of the bogoliubov mode will be large , and the excitation will disappear from the spectrum . in what follows below , we will assume that the non - zero modes have a small enough gap for the associated bogoliubov mode to be considered in the low energy spectrum .    in the axially @xmath125 symmetric cases considered in the next section we will find that although the classical low energy theory predicts the existence of two separate translational moduli as well as three moduli from the internal symmetry breaking @xmath242 , the quantized theory will show only one type a translational mode , one @xmath1 abelian type b mode , and one non - abelian type a mode .",
    "the reduction of two translational moduli to one quantized mode is of course well understood from the study of kelvin excitations of vortices in superfluid @xmath185he .",
    "the @xmath1 mode will follow from the breaking of the axial @xmath95 symmetry .",
    "the remaining two independent moduli @xmath193 will form a single quantized non - abelian mode . for an axially asymmetric vortex completely breaking @xmath243 an additional mode from @xmath244 would appear .    before proceeding to a detailed discussion axially symmetric vortex excitations",
    "we wish to illustrate this method in detail by applying it to the case of a vortex with real vector @xmath245 and @xmath246 considered in the previous section .",
    "this ansatz is not axially @xmath125 symmetric , so we do not make any initial claims about the number and type of quantized modes in this case .",
    "applying general translations , rotations , and @xmath95 transformations the moduli appear in @xmath247 where @xmath192 , @xmath248 , and @xmath100 are functions of @xmath40 and @xmath249 .",
    "additionally , it will be particularly convenient to consider the rotational moduli in the form @xmath250 and consider the real modulus fields @xmath251 instead of @xmath252 .    inserting this solution into ( [ glfe ] ) and integrating over @xmath93 and @xmath94 we arrive at the following low energy theory @xmath253 where @xmath254 is the @xmath255 antisymmetric matrix .",
    "the couplings @xmath256 and @xmath257 are determined from the integration over @xmath258 : @xmath259 the low energy theory derived here shows the emergence of an @xmath32 sigma model very similar in form to the low energy theory of gapless excitations of ano strings in yang - mills theories .",
    "for comparison see @xcite .",
    "classically the low energy theory contains five gapless moduli from @xmath208 , @xmath260 , and @xmath100 .",
    "the @xmath95 modulus @xmath100 appears in ( [ eftoriginal ] ) with a time derivative term at quadratic order .",
    "this term can be derived by considering the fluctuations of the magnitude of the @xmath30 field in the vortex core .",
    "considering these fluctuations @xmath261 to quadratic order in @xmath262 in the free energy we arrive at a term linear in @xmath262 of the form @xmath263 integrating out the massive field @xmath262 and performing the integrations over the perpendicular coordinates @xmath37 we arrive at the quadratic time derivative term for @xmath100 in ( [ eftoriginal ] ) .",
    "we note that the @xmath264 part of ( [ eftoriginal ] ) contains no time derivative terms since these terms only appear as total derivatives ( to quadratic order in @xmath265 ) and thus do not contribute to the low energy effective theory .",
    "naively it might be expected that the coupling of @xmath265 to non - zero modes would produce quadratic time derivative terms of the form @xmath266 in the effective free energy similar to the case of @xmath100 . however",
    ", a careful analysis shows that this is not the case .",
    "instead when we consider fluctuations of the form @xmath267 the fluctuating non - zero modes @xmath268 coupling to @xmath269 appear in the effective theory as @xmath270 which is a total derivative at linear order in @xmath268 and thus can not contribute to the dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "this result follows from the requirement of time reversal symmetry .",
    "if we relax the constraint that @xmath271 be a real vector then we may consider complex fluctuations @xmath272 in which case the time derivative terms of @xmath269 will no longer be total derivatives , and two propagating non - abelian modes may appear as bogoliubov modes in form @xmath273    summarizing the analysis the quantized effective theory ( [ eftoriginal ] ) describes the propagation of a translational kelvin mode with quadratic dispersion and an axial @xmath95 mode @xmath100 with linear dispersion along with potentially two additional non - abelian bogoliubov modes from ( [ nonabelianeftmodes ] ) .",
    "the kelvin and @xmath95 modes appear on vortex lines of superfluid @xmath185he and are well studied in that system .",
    "the non - abelian modes are of course exclusive to systems with tensorial order parameter .",
    "at this point we switch on a small but non - zero @xmath209 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath209 is small enough that we may neglect the corrections to the vortex solutions of @xmath123 and @xmath153 , as well as the constants @xmath256 and @xmath257 .",
    "aside from these uninteresting numerical corrections ( [ feff ] ) remains of the same form , however there are additional terms representing the breaking of the @xmath274 symmetries .",
    "they appear as follows @xmath275 where @xmath276 represents symmetry breaking terms , which in this case are given by @xmath277 here @xmath278 , and @xmath279 represents a mass gap parameter given by @xmath280 in this form @xmath279 is known as the  twisted mass \" @xcite .    for the case that @xmath281 the free energy",
    "will be minimized at @xmath282 and thus both moduli @xmath260 will no longer be gapless . if @xmath283 @xmath284 and the effective theory will retain one non - abelian gapless modulus . in both cases",
    "the kelvin and axial modes will remain gapless .",
    "at this point we may consider the low energy effective theory emerging on the @xmath125 axially symmetric vortex solutions , which present a richer , but more involved analysis .",
    "as mentioned in the previous sections in the case that @xmath285 we expect to observe five modulus fields for the classical theory that will be reduced to one translational and one axial @xmath95 mode , along with additional non - abelian modes following the quantization .",
    "we proceed by writing the axial vortex solution in the @xmath286 eigenbasis and performing translational , rotational , and @xmath95 transformations @xmath287 where @xmath288 are the new coordinates generated by the translations @xmath289 , and @xmath290 is a @xmath91 rotation given as a function of the moduli @xmath291 .",
    "henceforth , @xmath292 will refer to the @xmath248-dependent @xmath293 . additionally , the @xmath95 modulus @xmath100 is a function of @xmath40 and @xmath249 . decomposing ( [ moddecomp ] ) into the trace , antisymmetric , and symmetric parts and converting to the @xmath294-basis we find @xmath295 we will also neglect @xmath296 and @xmath297 in ( [ cartdecomp ] ) as these components are typically much smaller than @xmath29 , @xmath161 and @xmath173 , and contribute only small corrections to the low energy effective theory",
    "additionally , these contributions will not affect the number of quantized modes appearing in the theory .",
    "proceeding with these assumptions as well as the requirement that @xmath285 we may apply the methods of the previous section to arrive at the following low energy effective theory @xmath298 where again @xmath254 is the @xmath299 antisymmetric symbol and @xmath256 and @xmath300 are given by @xmath301 the interesting features to point out from ( [ feffaxial ] ) include the last two lines showing the @xmath130 symmetry respected by the vortex solutions .",
    "thus as expected only five independent moduli from the broken translational and internal non - abelian generators . additionally , the expected single kelvin mode emerging from the dynamical term has appeared just as in the previous examples .",
    "the first term in the second line describing the time dependence of the non - abelian modes is new . in the limit of small oscillations",
    "we may consider rotations to the first order in @xmath291 and consider @xmath302 which gives the following result for the time dependent term @xmath303 thus we see that only one independent mode emerges from the modulus fields after quantization as the fields @xmath193 are the conjugate momenta of each other .",
    "this mode is a type a goldstone mode with quadratic dispersion relation .",
    "additionally the second term in the second line of ( [ feffaxial ] ) also includes a term quadratic in the time derivative of @xmath100 implying that the @xmath95 bogoliubov mode appears due to the coupling of @xmath100 with the massive oscillations of @xmath161 and @xmath173 as in the previous section . after integrating these oscillations out we arrive at the corresponding term in ( [ feffaxial ] ) .",
    "it is clear that this term also preserves the @xmath125 symmetry .    for completeness",
    "we consider the additional gradient terms in the free energy ( [ glfe ] ) when @xmath304 .",
    "for the purposes of illustration we will omit the contributing terms from @xmath172 as they are notationally complex but do not introduce any additional interesting effects .",
    "as before we assume that the @xmath209 corrections have negligible effect on the functions @xmath123 and @xmath166 .",
    "thus we find the following additional terms to @xmath305 : @xmath306 where @xmath307 and @xmath308 where @xmath309 is a constant determined by the @xmath2 parameters .",
    "@xmath310 represents a symmetric mass matrix illustrating the crossing factors between @xmath165 and @xmath167 : @xmath311 the emerging mass terms in ( [ modeffaxial ] ) are again the result of the breaking of @xmath312 .",
    "thus only a certain combination of the internal rotational moduli @xmath313 and the translational @xmath314 moduli remain massless .",
    "additionally , only the quantized mode associated with this combination will be gapless .",
    "thus since the gapless mode associated with the axial @xmath95 symmetry is not broken by these additional terms , we have a total of two gapless excitations .",
    "the non - abelian mode becomes quasi - gapless .",
    "this is a familiar result similar to the case of superfluid @xmath185he .    although we will not consider the axial @xmath125 asymmetric case in detail here ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) , we will make a few brief remarks on the number and type of modes existing for both the @xmath8 and @xmath315 cases .",
    "the most important change that is observed for this case is that the modes @xmath190 and @xmath100 are no longer equivalent and thus the single mode for the axial symmetric case will divide into two type b modes with linear dispersion for the axial asymmetric case .",
    "the other modes from the axial symmetric case are the same for the asymmetric case and thus a total of four modes exist for the axially asymmetric vortex .",
    "again for the case that @xmath315 but small the non - abelian mode from @xmath193 will become quasi - gapless .",
    "table 2 summarizes the number and type of modes emerging for the various core types .",
    "@lllllcc core type & @xmath192 & @xmath193 & @xmath190 & @xmath100 & #  modes",
    "@xmath8 & #  modes @xmath315 + @xmath316 , @xmath317 & a & @xmath196 & @xmath196 & @xmath196 & 1 & 1 + @xmath316 , @xmath318 & a & @xmath196 & @xmath196 & b & 2 & 2 + @xmath200 & a & @xmath196 & @xmath196 & b & 2 & 2 + @xmath319@xmath204 & a & b@xmath320 & @xmath196 & b & 4 & 2 + @xmath125 symmetric & a & a@xmath321 & & 3 & 2 + broken @xmath125 & a & a@xmath321 & b & b & 4 & 3 +    @xmath204we assume the ground state of @xmath322 along the @xmath40-axis with @xmath323 excitations .",
    "@xmath324 we have noted the equivalence of @xmath100 and @xmath190 modes for the @xmath125 core .",
    "in this work we have extended the analysis of previous analysis to include a description of gapless excitations of axially symmetric vortices in systems similar to the ginzburg - landau description of superfluid @xmath0he in the b phase .",
    "we have shown that in the case that @xmath325 the classical low energy theory includes the translational modulus fields presenting the well studied kelvin excitations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the theory contains three additional moduli from the breaking of the non - abelian @xmath205 to the locked orbital - phase @xmath326 group .",
    "these results have been developed using standard techniques of high energy physics to determine the classical low energy theory .",
    "in addition , we have introduced the time dependent part of the ginzburg - landau free energy to facilitate the discussion of quantization of the gapless excitations . in particular , we have discussed the number of gapless excitations emerging from the classical moduli determined from the broken symmetry generators . in the present context",
    "the procedure of determining the gapless goldstone modes is somewhat subtle due to the non - lorentz invariance of the action @xcite .",
    "specifically , we have shown that out of the five moduli emerging from the broken symmetry , only three appear as independent goldstone modes after quantization .",
    "two of these are the type a kelvin mode and the type b axial @xmath95 mode , which have been well studied both experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "the additional mode is the type a internal non - abelian mode resulting from the breaking of @xmath91 by the vortex line .",
    "additionally , upon introduction of small but non - zero @xmath209 terms in the free energy ( [ glfe ] ) we observe the translational and rotational @xmath91 modulus fields develop additional interactions .",
    "this is due to the explicit breaking of the separate internal and external rotations @xmath327 to the rotational @xmath18 .",
    "since external rotations of the vortex line about the @xmath93 and @xmath94 axes are equivalent to local translations we see that the translational moduli couple to the @xmath91 moduli with coefficients proportional to @xmath209 in the free energy .",
    "in addition , the new terms imply that only a particular combination of the translational and non - abelian moduli remain massless . this process is sometimes called the inverse higgs mechanism in the high energy community @xcite . in this case",
    "only the moduli from the broken abelian symmetries remain strictly massless , while the other two non - abelian modes are considered quasi - gapless .",
    "thus after quantization only the kelvin and @xmath95 mode remain strictly gapless .",
    "the non - abelian mode becomes quasi - gapless for small @xmath9 .",
    "we wish to point out that although we have extended our analysis from the previous paper @xcite ) to include the effects of quantization on our classically gapless modes , we have neglected to include the effects of higher order loop corrections to the effective potential . in the context of condensed matter systems such as superfluid @xmath0he",
    "these corrections will have little effect on the conclusions of the present work .",
    "however , for an application of these corrections to the case of non - abelian strings see the analysis presented in @xcite .",
    "we wish to conclude by pointing out the similarities between the present discussion of the excitations of mass vortices in condensed matter systems to the excitations of ano strings @xcite in yang - mills theories .",
    "the low energy theory describing the gapless excitations of axially symmetric vortices closely resembles the emergent @xmath328-dimensional o(3 ) sigma model of non - abelian modes of ano strings in yang - mills theories @xcite . in the present case however ,",
    "the @xmath16 phase symmetry is considered as a global symmetry in contrast to the case of yang - mills ano strings where the phase symmetry is a @xmath1 gauge symmetry .",
    "thus in our case the phase symmetry presents a modulus field on the low energy theory , which would not be the case for ano strings in yang - mills theories .",
    "this modulus @xmath100 leads to the @xmath95 bogoliubov mode with linear dispersion .",
