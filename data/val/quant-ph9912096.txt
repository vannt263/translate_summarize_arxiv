    "in this paper , we analyze in some detail the effects of raman noise on solitons . in particular",
    "we derive approximate analytic expressions and provide further detail for the precise numerical results published earlier@xcite .",
    "the motivation for this study is essentially that coupling to phonons is one property of a solid medium that definitely does not obey the nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "the presence of raman interactions plays a major role in perturbing the fundamental soliton behaviour of the nonlinear schrdinger equation in optical fibers .",
    "this perturbation is in addition to the more straightforward gain / loss effects that produce the well - known gordon - haus effect@xcite .",
    "the complete derivation of the quantum theory for optical fibers is given in an earlier paper@xcite , denoted ( qni ) . that paper presented a detailed derivation of the quantum hamiltonian , and included quantum noise effects due to nonlinearities , gain , loss , raman reservoirs and brillouin scattering .",
    "phase - space techniques allowed the quantum heisenberg equations of motion to be mapped onto stochastic partial differential equations .",
    "the result was a generalized nonlinear schrdinger equation , which can be solved numerically or with perturbative analytical techniques .",
    "the starting point for this paper is the phase - space equation for the case of a single polarization mode , obtained using a truncated wigner representation , which is accurate in the limit of large photon number .",
    "we use both soliton perturbation theory and numerical integration of the phase - space equation to calculate effects on soliton propagation of all known quantum noise sources , with good agreement between the two methods .",
    "our main result is that the raman noise due to thermal phonon reservoirs is strongly dependent on both temperature and pulse intensity . at room temperature",
    ", this means that raman jitter and phase noise become steadily more important as the pulse intensity is increased , which occurs when a shorter soliton pulse is required for a given fiber dispersion .",
    "using typical fiber parameters , we estimate that raman - induced jitter is more important than the well - known gordon - haus jitter for pulses shorter than about one picosecond .",
    "although we do not analyze this in detail here , we note that similar perturbations may occur during the collision of short pulses in a frequency - multiplexed environment .",
    "we begin with the raman - modified stochastic nonlinear schrdinger equation [ eq .  ( 6.3 ) of ( qni ) ] , obtained using the wigner representation , for simplicity :    @xmath1\\phi ( \\tau , \\zeta ) \\ , \\ , .",

    "the group velocity @xmath7 and the dispersion relation @xmath8 are calculated at the carrier frequency @xmath9 .",
    "apart from a cut - off dependent vacuum noise , the photon flux is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the typical number of photons in a soliton pulse of width @xmath5 , again for scaling purposes . in this definition",
    ", the fibre is assumed to have a modal cross - sectional area @xmath12 and a change in refractive index per unit intensity of @xmath13 .",
    "the positive sign in front of the second derivative term applies for anomalous dispersion ( @xmath14 ) , and the negative sign applies for normal dispersion ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 are gain / loss and raman scattering response functions respectively , while @xmath18 and @xmath19 are stochastic terms , discussed below .",
    "similar , but more accurate , equations occur with the positive-@xmath20 representation , although in this case , the phase - space dimension is doubled . in order to simplify the calculations further",
    ", we assume that gain and loss in the fiber are broadband relative to the soliton bandwidth , and balance exactly .",
    "this requires that the amplifier sections in the fiber are sufficiently close together ( of the order of the soliton scaling length or less ) so that the soliton can propagate without distortion@xcite .    for the analytic calculations",
    ", we also assume that the raman nonlinear response function is instantaneous on the timescale of the soliton width .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming that the phonon modes are heavily damped , and means that the raman coupling leads to only incoherent scattering of the propagating radiation .",
    "while this approximation neglects the well - known self - frequency shift@xcite , we find that the self - frequency shift by itself is not a major cause of jitter for the distance scales we consider here .",
    "this assumption can be improved at the expense of more complicated analytic calculations .",
    "however , the full equations are used in the numerical simulations , which agree quite well with our analytic predictions .",
    "the raman - modified equation then reduces to @xmath21 \\phi ( \\tau , \\zeta ) + \\gamma^{c } ( \\tau , \\zeta ) \\ , \\ , , & \\label{nlse } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the bracketed term represents the usual nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation in normalized , propagative form .",
    "the combined noise sources have been grouped together as @xmath22      equation ( [ nlse ] ) is a complex - number equation that can accurately represent quantum operator evolution through the inclusion of various noise sources . in the absence of any noise sources",
    ", this equation reduces to the classical nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "this deterministic limit corresponds to taking @xmath23 . as well as the noise sources explicitly appearing in eq .",
    "( [ nlse ] ) , there must be noise in the initial conditions to properly represent a quantum state in the wigner representation .",
    "regardless of the initial quantum state chosen , there must be at least minimal level of initial fluctuations in @xmath24 to satisfy heisenberg s uncertainty principle .",
    "we choose to begin with a multimode coherent state , which contains this minimal level of initial quantum noise and which is an accurate model of mode - locked laser output .",
    "this is also the simplest model for the output of mode - locked lasers , and we note that , in general , there could be extra technical noise . for coherent inputs ,",
    "the wigner vacuum fluctuations are gaussian , and are correlated as @xmath25    physical quantities can be calculated from this phase - space simulation by averaging products of @xmath24 and @xmath26 over many stochastic trajectories . in this wigner representation , these stochastic averages correspond to the ensemble averages of symmetrically - ordered products of quantum operators , such as those representing homodyne measurements and other measurements of phase .",
    "both fiber loss and the presence of a gain medium each contribute quantum noise to the equations in the symmetrically - ordered wigner representation .",
    "the complex gain / absorption noise enters the nonlinear schdinger ( nls ) equation through an additive stochastic term @xmath27 , whose correlations are : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the fourier transform of the noise source : @xmath30 the dimensionless intensity gain and loss are given by @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .    similarly , the real raman noise , which appears as a multiplicative stochastic variable @xmath33 , has correlations @xmath34",

    "thus the raman noise is strongly temperature dependent , but it also contains a spontaneous component which provides vacuum fluctuations even at @xmath37 .    as the @xmath38 dependence of all the noise correlations show , the classical limit of these quantum calculations is the deterministic nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "the problem of jitter in soliton communications is an example of how intrinsic quantum features can have a direct macroscopic consequence , even in a way that impinges on current developments of applied technology .",
    "there are , of course , classical contributions to jitter , such as noise arising from technical sources .",
    "however , it is the jitter contributions from essentially quantum processes , namely spontaneous emission in fibre amplifiers , that is the current limiting factor in soliton based communications systems .",
    "other jitter calculations rely on a classical formulation with an empirical addition of amplifier noise , and important predictions of the gordon - haus effect have been obtained .",
    "nevertheless , this quantum treatment presented here of all known noise sources is necessary to determine the limiting effects of other intrinsic noise sources , which become important for shorter pulses and longer dispersion lengths .    in the absence of the noise sources , the phase - space equations have stationary solutions in the form of bright ( @xmath39 ) or dark ( @xmath40 ) solitons .",
    "solitons are solitary waves in which the effects of dispersion are balanced by nonlinear effects , to produce a stationary pulse that is robust in the presence of perturbations .",
    "we note here that , in reality , the raman response function is noninstantaneous , which causes a redshift in the soliton frequency .",
    "this soliton self - frequency shift is a deterministic effect , and so can be neglected in the treatment of noise effects , to a first approximation",
    ". the accuracy of this approximation will be evident in the subsequent comparison of analytic with numerical results .",
    "the numerical results all include the complete nonlinear response function , rather than the approximate instantaneous form given above",
    ".    excessive self - frequency shift may cause problems when finite bandwidth elements are used .",
    "however , it has been shown@xcite that bandwidth - limited gain can in fact cancel the effect of the raman redshift , by pulling the soliton back towards the centre of the spectral band . in the simulations we show in this paper ,",
    "the total redshift is estimated to be @xmath41 , which is small compared to the total width of the gain spectrum in typical fiber laser amplifiers ( @xmath42)@xcite .",

    "the raman jitter dominates the gordon - haus jitter ( by a factor of two in the @xmath132 bright soliton case ) and will continue to do so even for long propagation distances . for short propagation distances , the gordon - haus effect is not exactly cubic , because of neglected terms in the perturbation expansion , which give a linear ( as opposed to cubic ) growth in the jitter variance . however , there are no such terms in the raman case .",
    "the analytic raman results are also shown in the figures , which show that our approximate formula gives a reasonable fit to the numerical data even for subpicosecond pulses . using this approximate formula ,",
    "the relative size of the two effects scales as @xmath133^{2}\\rangle } _ { r}}{{\\langle [ \\delta t(x)]^{2}\\rangle } _ { gh } } & = & \\frac{6{\\mathcal{i}}(t_{0})|k''|}{g{t_{0}}^{2}}=\\frac{6{\\mathcal{i}}(t_{0})}{gx_{0}}\\simeq \\frac{8{\\mathcal{f}}(0)}{5gx_{0}}\\quad \\quad { ( \\textrm{bright})},\\nonumber \\\\ \\frac{{\\langle [ \\delta t(x)]^{2}\\rangle } _ { r}}{{\\langle [ \\delta t(x)]^{2}\\rangle } _ { gh } } & = & \\frac{3{\\mathcal{i}}(t_{0})|k''|}{g{t_{0}}^{2}}=\\frac{3{\\mathcal{i}}(t_{0})}{gx_{0}}\\simeq \\frac{4{\\mathcal{f}}(0)}{5gx_{0}}\\quad \\quad { ( \\textrm{dark})},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these equations show why experiments to date@xcite , which have used longer pulses ( @xmath134 ) and dispersion - shifted fiber , have not detected the raman - noise contribution to the jitter .",
    "the raman jitter exceeds the gordon - haus jitter for bright solitons with periods @xmath135 .",
    "dark solitons , on the other hand , have an enhanced resistance to the raman noise , which means that a shorter period is needed before the raman jitter will become important .    the total jitter , which corresponds to the realistic case where all three noise sources are active , is also shown in fig",
    ".  [ ol ] , and , in the bright soliton case , is about a factor of three larger than the ordinary gordon - haus effect , over the propagation distance shown .",
    "the physical origin of these quantum noise sources can not easily be suppressed .",
    "the initial vacuum - induced timing jitter is caused by the shot - noise variance in the soliton guiding frequency .",
    "the physical origin of the raman jitter is in frequency shifts due to soliton phase modulation by the ever - present quantum and thermal phonon fields in the fiber medium",
    ".    the numerical method should give accurate results far beyond the distance shown in fig .",
    "[ ol ] , provided that the transverse and propagative resolutions are made large enough .",
    "the equations generated in the wigner method should remain valid up to @xmath136 , which corresponds to about @xmath137 .",
    "when the wigner equations can no longer be trusted , the positive-@xmath20 equations will still give accurate results .",
    "this paper has not analysed any multisoliton effects , although the numerical method does simulate interactions between solitons .",
    "this just requires the initial conditions and simulation window width to be set up according to whether interactions are to be considered or not .",
    "we have not included third - order dispersion in our model , which would become important for very small pulses ( @xmath138 ) , but it could easily be included into the equations for numerical simulation .    the approximate analytic results are most limited probably by their exclusion of raman intrapulse effects , such as the deterministic self - frequency shift and the amplifier jitter that feeds through this .",
    "approximate calculations@xcite of the self - frequency shift jitter variance show that it grows as the fifth power of distance . with our parameters and the measured value of the raman time constant@xcite ,",
    "it would become larger than the usual gordon - haus effect at @xmath139 , or about 10 times the propagation distance shown in fig .",
    "[ ol ] . using standard techniques@xcite ,",
    "the perturbation theory presented in this paper could be extended to include the self - frequency shift contributions ( from both the amplifier noise and raman phase noise ) to the total jitter .",
    "our major conclusion is that quantum noise effects due to the intrinsic finite - temperature phonon reservoirs are a dominant source of fluctuations in phase and arrival time , for subpicosecond solitons . for longer solitons ,",
    "raman effects are reduced when compared to the gordon - haus jitter from the laser gain medium that is needed to compensate for losses .",
    "the reason for this is the smaller intensity of the pulse , and therefore the reduced raman couplings that occur for longer solitons  which are less intense than shorter solitons with the same dispersion .",
    "the ratio can be calculated simply from the product @xmath140 , which gives the gain per soliton length .",
    "a smaller @xmath141 corresponds to a shorter , more intense soliton and hence a larger raman noise ; while a larger @xmath142 corresponds to increased laser gain , with larger spontaneous noise .    at a given pulse duration and fiber length , a strategy for testing",
    "this prediction would be to use short pulses with dispersion - shifted fiber having an increased dispersion , since this increases the relative size of the raman jitter .",
    "the physical reason for this is very simple .",
    "solitons have an intensity which increases with dispersion if everything else is unchanged . at the same time",
    ", the multiplicative phase noise found in raman propagation is proportional to intensity , and hence becomes relatively large compared to the additive gordon - haus noise due to amplification .",
    "for large enough dispersion , the temperature - dependent raman jitter should become readily observable at short enough distances so that amplification is unnecessary .",
    "this would give a completely unambiguous signature of the effect we have calculated . a mode - locked fiber soliton laser",
    "would be a suitable pulse source , owing to the very short ( @xmath143 ) , quiet pulses@xcite that are obtainable .",
