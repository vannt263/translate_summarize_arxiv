    "@xmath8 scuti stars are a class of pulsating variable stars that lies in the classical instability strip crosses the main sequence on the hertzsprung - russell diagram , whose pulsations are driven by the @xmath9mechanism which drives both the cepheids and the rr lyrae stars as well . with masses between @xmath10 and @xmath11 , periods between @xmath12 and @xmath13 ,",
    "luminosities between @xmath14 and @xmath15 , these stars pulsate with amplitudes from mmag up to tenths of a magnitude .",
    "+ the high - amplitude @xmath8 scuti stars ( hereafter hads ) are traditionally found to be slow rotators with one or two dominant radial modes with amplitudes larger than 0.1 mag , although they may occasionally have low - amplitude , non - radial modes in addition to the main pulsation modes ( @xcite ) . it is interesting to probe whether it is an overall property of all hads .",
    "+ sx phoenicis ( sx phe ) stars , a subgroup of hads , are old pop .",
    "because of the insufficient amount and the poor photometric precision of the observation data , whether any low - amplitude pulsations exist besides the dominant radial modes in most sx phe stars are unknown .",
    "according to the existing data , they could probably be either in a post - giant branch stage of evolution or merged binary stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "although most sx phe stars , which are characterized by high amplitudes of pulsation , low metallicity , and large spatial motion , are found to be members of globular clusters ( @xcite ) , some of them have been discovered in the general star fields ( @xcite ) .",
    "particularly , pulsations in the majority of the field sx phe variables display very simple frequency spectra with short periods ( @xmath16 ) and large visual peak - to - peak amplitudes ( @xmath17 , c.f.@xcite ) .",
    "precise time - series photometric observations reveal period changes in these stars , which should theoretically reflect the evolutionary changes in radius . @xcite",
    "collected observed period changes found in some hads ( including sx phe stars ) and indicated that sudden jumps of period could be an explanation for the period changes observed in the sx phe stars .",
    "additionally , the study of period changes of double - mode sx phe stars raises a further important question : how does the overtone frequency change ? from a simple theoretical consideration , one could guess that the fundamental and overtone frequencies of radially pulsating sx phe stars change in the same direction and at about the same rate .",
    "however , the star we study in this paper , ae uma , has the fundamental and first overtone frequencies changed neither in the same direction nor at the same rate ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to investigate pulsation behaviors of this star with the extended data of improved photometric precision .",
    "+ the star ae ursae majoris ( hereafter ae uma)(= hip 47181 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , a9 ) , was discovered by @xcite .",
    "the spectral type of ae uma was classified by @xcite as a9 in accordance with the type of variability . until 1973",
    ", it was shown that the star had significant light - curve variation with the determination of the period of the light variation and the type of variability as dwarf cepheid ( @xcite ) .",
    "then , the 1974 konkoly observations found the beat phenomenon ( @xcite ) . in 1995 ,",
    "the star is listed as an sx phe star in @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite showed strong evidence against this classification , and reclassified it as a normal population i , high - amplitude @xmath8 scuti star . according to the calculation of @xcite ,",
    "ae uma had such fast period decreasing ( @xmath23 ) only if it was a pre - ms star , but there exists no evidence that it is a pre - ms star .",
    "at last , both @xcite and @xcite analyzed pulsations of the star with better and longer data sets , and the results rejected the outcomes from @xcite .",
    "ae uma was classified as a pop .",
    "ii , post - ms sx phe star once again , with the fundamental frequency stable and the first overtone decreasing with a rate of about @xmath24 . + in the following sections , we present a detailed study of the period changes of ae uma , mainly based on extended time - series ccd observations from 2009 to 2012 collected at the xinglong station of national astronomical observatories of china ( naoc ) .",
    "the organization of the paper is : section 2 describes observations and data reduction ; section 3 introduces the pulsation analysis of the new data ; section 4 discusses the variations of the periods ; section 5 calculates the models with the constraints of the frequencies and their variations ; section 6 lists our conclusions .",
    "photometric observations for ae uma were made with the 85-cm telescope located at the xinglong station of naoc between march 2009 and may 2012 .",
    "the 85-cm telescope is equipped with a standard johnson - cousin - bessel multicolour filter system and a pi1024 bft ccd camera mounted on the primary focus ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ccd camera has @xmath25 pixels , corresponding to a field of view of @xmath26 . since march 2012",
    ", the ccd camera has been replaced by a pi512 bft , which has @xmath27 pixels corresponding to a field of view of @xmath28 .",
    "the observations were made through a standard johnson @xmath29 filter with the exposure time ranging from 15 to 120 seconds , depending on the atmospheric conditions .",
    "a journal of the new observations is listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    ".journal of observations with the 85-cm telescope . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one can see that the results were in agreement with the values in @xcite , except the mass . with their observations and the method used ,",
    "onecan believe that the @xmath30 $ ] and the @xmath31 values were in great reliability ( @xcite ) .",
    "so , we decided to use the value @xmath30 = -0.3 $ ] and @xmath32 .",
    "we used the fomula @xmath33 = \\log(\\frac{z}{x } ) - \\log(\\frac{z}{x})_{\\odot}\\ ] ] and the fomula @xmath34 to calculate the initial z. in @xcite , the model was calculated with the couple of value @xmath35 , which accord with the values in our previous calculation ( derived by mesa astero with the value of @xmath30 $ ] ) .",
    "at last , integrating all the informaiton about the value of @xmath36 , we decided to choose @xmath37 as the unique initial value for the subsequent calculation .",
    "not like the solar - like stars for which many frequencies are detected , hads exits only one or two frequencies . as a result ,",
    "the period variation becomes a very important constraint on the model calculation of these stars .",
    "detection of high precision of period variation may offer strong constraints on ae uma .",
    "it is interesting that ae uma exits two frequencies with period variations in different scales and signs .",
    "but with the linear pulsation theory , variation of the period along with the stellar evolution should have values in the same sign and the same scale in most time .",
    "we used two different ways to calculate the period variations of ae uma theoretically .",
    "the vatiation rate of the fundamental period derived from long intervals of observations of ae uma shows a positive period change . from the theoretical point of view , the period changes caused by stellar evolution in and across the lower instability strip permit an observational test of stellar evolution theroy ( @xcite ) .    assuming that the stellar mass @xmath38 for the @xmath8 scuti stars during the observation interval with mass of @xmath39 and that the variation of pulsation constant is negligible as a very small quantity , @xcite got @xmath40 where p is the period of a radial pulsation",
    ", @xmath41 is the bolometric absolute magnitude , @xmath42 is the effective temperature .",
    "as indicated by @xcite , the sx phe variables locate on or near the main sequence of the h - r diagram .",
    "consequently , the evolutionary models are constructed from the pre - main - sequence hayashi phase to the end of the post main sequence .",
    "as mentioned , the parameters we used are @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "in addition , we do not take the effect of rotation into account since ae uma is a low - speed rotator .",
    "the evolutionary tracks we constructed from @xmath46 to @xmath47 are shown in figure [ fig6 ] , and the corresponding variation of the period were marked in the figure .",
    "to @xmath47 for @xmath43 .",
    "the rectangle shown on the h - r diagram is determined from the observed parameters of ae uma .",
    "marks on the tracks indicate the evolutionary period changes of @xmath48 with the value inside the interval @xmath49 $ ] in units of @xmath50 . ]    as shown in the figure [ fig6 ] , the state which are consonant with the observed period change values derived from the @xmath2 analysis appear before the first turn - offs and after the second turn - offs on the evolutionary tracks when they leave the ms .      adipls ( the aarhus adiabatic oscillation package ) is a programme for calculation of adiabatic oscillations of stellar models ( @xcite ) .",
    "we used it to calculate the frequencies of the model at each step of our evolutionary state .",
    "as a result , we got the frequencies of the model of @xmath51 and @xmath52 then deduced the variation of the frequencies of @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in the calculation",
    ", we assumed that @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the frequencies with @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we calculated the evolutionary tracks from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , getting the frequencies on each tracks , as shown in figure [ fig7 ] .    in figure [ fig7 ]",
    ", one can see that the models with appropriate frequencies for ae uma could appear ( a ) just before the first turn - offs , ( b ) after the first and before the second turn - offs , ( c ) just after the second turn - offs .",
    "in addition , we also calculated the variation of the frequencies of the models using adipls .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "it was not surprising that figure [ fig8 ] was in accord with figure [ fig6 ] , which showed also the variation of the fundamental frequency .",
    "in figure [ fig9 ] , we show the models with variation of the first overtone frequency @xmath52 in accord with the observed values . for the adiabaticity of the code adipls",
    ", we get the variation of @xmath52 almost as that of @xmath51 , with the same scale and the sign , even though they may not be equal to each other exactly in every points .",
    "the @xmath55 values from literatures have a low reliability , but the @xmath31 values have a high reliability are not sensitive to the evolutionary effect . as a result , we show the figures both of them ( @xmath55 vs @xmath56 , @xmath31 vs @xmath56 ) .    integrating the results of calculation of the frequencies and the variation of frequencies and comparison with the observed values , we can conclude that ae uma should locate on either before the first turn - offs or after the second turn - offs of the evolutionary tracks leaving the ms .",
    "we assume that ae uma is a regular radial pulsator with two frequencies .",
    "the variation of the fundamental frequency of ae uma is caused by the evolutionary effect .",
    "the rate of the variation is consistant with the theoretically predicted values by @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", we would discuss the variation of the first overtone period which puts another constraint on the models .",
    "but once we put these constraints ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath48 and @xmath57 ) together , we can not find any overlap on the evolutionary tracks ( superimposing figure [ fig7 ] , figure [ fig8 ] and figure [ fig9 ] ) . considering with the adiabaticity of adipls",
    ", we can just obtain the different pulsation modes period changes with same signs and scales .",
    "as we know , the evolutionary effect is originated from the core nuclear reaction , and propagate from inner to outer of the stellar .",
    "so we can conclude the evolution of the exterior is later than it of interior .",
    "in the theory of stellar pulsation , the domain of fundamental mode pulsation is deeper ( more close to the core ) than first overtone mode pulsation . or",
    "we can say that the fundamental mode is more sensitive than the first overtone mode to the effect of evolution .    hence , when the evolution state of the interior of the star pass through the second turn - off on the tracks ( figure [ fig8 ] ) , the exterior of the star is still in the state between the two turn - offs and preparing to pass through the second turn - off .    with the discussion above",
    ", one can explain the different signs of the period changes of the two pulsation modes , and conclude that ae uma is located just after the second turn - off on the evolutionary tracks ( see figure [ fig8 ] and figure [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "its corresponding mass ranges from @xmath46 to @xmath58 , age from @xmath59 to @xmath60 .",
    "with the photometric observation data from 2009 to 2012 obtained at xionglong station of naoc , we analyed the pulsations of ae uma and resolved up to 37 frequencies , 25 of which are newly detected .",
    "all these frequencies are shown to be harmonics or combinations of the two main frequencies @xmath0 and @xmath61 , corresponding to the fundamental and the first overtone modes .",
    "a new @xmath2 diagram was constructed with the 84 times of maximum light determined from our new observations and those listed in the literature , leading to the updated value of period @xmath62 .",
    "the new ephemeris with a quadratic solution suggests that the fundamental period change rate of ae uma @xmath3 and the first overtone period change with a rate of @xmath63 .",
    "the first value is different from the result obtained by @xcite , but the second is consistent with the value obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we calculated models of stars with masses between @xmath46 and @xmath47 . with the constraints of the values of @xmath51 ,",
    "@xmath52 , @xmath48 and @xmath57 , we concluded that ae uma locate near the second turn - off of the post - ms evolution tracks with the mass @xmath6 and the age @xmath7 .",
    "the results of our calculation support the hypothesis that the period variations derived from the observations are mainly a result of the stellar evolution .",
    "more precise spectroscopic observations are needed , with which one can get more accurate values of @xmath42 and @xmath31 , and stronger constraints on the stellar models . as a result , one can study details of the evolutionary effect propagating from the inner to the outer layer of the star .",
