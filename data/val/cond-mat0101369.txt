    "the classification and prediction of breaking processes within solid materials forms an extremely difficult problem in engineering science as well as in solid state physics .",
    "this is even true for brittle materials exhibiting the simplest rheological behavior , i.e. no remanent deformations .",
    "continuum mechanical treatments of brittle solids based on griffith s theory@xmath0 are quite widespread and accepeted in scientific papers , and have been relatively successful for practical and engineering purposes.@xmath1 there are , however , a couple of problems being associated with classical fracture mechanics limiting its range of application .",
    "certain restrictions arise from the assumption that the deformations can be conducted in a thermodynamical reversible manner .",
    "connected to this is the basic assumption that the involved fracture processes are thermodynamically reversible too .",
    "this is usually expressed by minimizing thermodynamic potentials with respect to crack / fracture growth , which is a perturbational scheme .",
    "the typical modelling situation is such that some governing field equations are describing the global state of the deformation ( i.e. the free energy density ) according to some boundary / loading conditions while the free surface energy _ field _ ( intrinsic strength )",
    "is classically assumed to be a constant property throughout the solid material .",
    "the assumption of a constant intrinsic strength constitutes a quite strong idealization for most experimental situations because it eliminates the field nature of cohesional properties .",
    "the assumption of a constant theoretical strength is most easily justified for _ homogeneous _",
    "materials , i.e. , perfect single crystals .",
    "however , even for such classes of materials there exist certain limitations : a ) the crystal s cohesion is in general non - isotropic ( variation in crystal strength according crystallographic directions ) and b ) the cohesion is subject of thermal influences ( lattice vibrations ) introducing thermal fluctuations into the problem .    the survey becomes more difficult for most solid materials of practical interest as they are frequently composite materials .",
    "variations of cohesional properties occur already on macroscopic length scales comparable to those of the microstructural elements .",
    "there is _ no _ simple argument to replace the theoretical strengths of the isolated solid phases by some average effective strength in connection with fracture problems .",
    "this is because the fracture and its associated _ natural geometry _ advances on a microstructural level where the heterogeneity in grain orientation and strength is present .",
    "we mention this in order to illustrate that the assumption of constant cohesion / binding properties throughout a solid and therefore the representation employing a homogeneous continuum needs careful consideration .",
    "the investigation of geometrical properties of irreversibly grown cracks in the presence of disorder has recently received considerable attention amoung physicists .",
    "basic ideas go back to statistical physics , theory of phase transitions , scaling theory , selfsimilarity and self - organized criticality .",
    "these concepts are described in good standard books of condensed matter physics , i.e. chaikin & lubensky.@xmath2 + perhaps one of the most well studied phenomena exhibiting self - organized criticality is diffusion limited aggregation ( dla ) , theoretically first implemented by witten & sander.@xmath3 its outline is quite simple and it is well suited to exemplify geometrical selfsimilarity .",
    "+ particles being small enough to be subject to brownian motion diffuse in a large gas or fluid reservoir .",
    "the particle concentration is assumed to be very low ( infinite dilution ) , i.e. , there are at each time step precisely one diffusing particle and one cluster where the diffusing particle is allowed to be attached to .",
    "if the diffusing particle touches the particle - cluster it sticks to it forever and a new diffusing particle is started far away from the cluster .",
    "the process is called diffusion limited because the particle diffusion is the rate limiting step in this reaction scheme .",
    "figure @xmath4 shows such a dla cluster .",
    "the cluster has a dendritic structure exhibiting branches on all length scales between particle and cluster length scale .",
    "this supposes that the average number @xmath5 of particles belonging to the cluster follows a power law in cluster radius @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath7 the exponent @xmath8 is called the _ fractal dimension _ of the cluster .",
    "the value for @xmath8 is in general always smaller equal the embedding dimension ; in the above example @xmath9 . the physical meaning of a power law relation eq.([equation : df ] ) is that the structure does not contain any natural length scale and that it looks similar to itself ( selfsimilar ) under a change of scale .",
    "the reader interested into concepts and applications of fractals is referred to references [ feder ] and [ bunde ] .",
    "nowadays it is widely believed that the value of the fractal dimension does only depend on the symmetries of the governing equations but not on particularities such as the particle shape or the employed discretisation scheme in numerical simulations .",
    "deviations from scaling behavior are anticipated for systems of finite size .",
    "+ the main interest in the dla problem results from the fact that the governing equation is the laplace equation being one of the most widespread and simplest equations in physics . a diffusing particle sticks with probability proportional to @xmath10 to the clustersurface with @xmath11 being the solution of the diffusion equation .",
    "the sticking - probability is highest near the clusters extremities , so that the cluster is growing at a higher rate at the tips than in its interior .",
    "the tips screen the cluster interior to a certain amount leading to a diluted dendritic structure .",
    "other examples belonging to the same _ universality class _ as dla are the dielectric breakdown ( dbm ) ( see fig .  [ lichtenberg_fig ] ) , the viscous fingering ( vf ) ( see fig .  [ vandamme_fig]a ) and the stefan problem of solidification.@xmath12 all this problems lead experimentally and numerically to similar geometrical patterns .",
    "there has been considerable discussion whether fracture processes in presence of fluctuations would lead to dla - like breakdown pattern too .",
    "the conducted investigations do , however , not support this idea in an unambiguous way .",
    "rather the structure of the basic elastic equations ( lam or cosserat equations ) _ can not _ be reduced to a laplace type equation even in limiting cases for the elastic constants .",
    "the experiments of van damme and collaborators on twodimensionally confined clay pastes display a sharp transition between dla morphologies ( viscous fingering , compare fig .",
    "[ vandamme_fig]a ) and the much more spiky and diluted hydraulic fractures , e.g. see fig .",
    "[ vandamme_fig]b .    further below",
    "we will present numerically obtained results mainly concerned with the problem of hydraulic fracturing of disordered materials in two dimensions .",
    "+ we will first consider the case in which the model material contains only elastic interactions .",
    "we will investigate the cases of a constant injection ( borhole- ) pressure and of a constant fluid influx .",
    "+ in a later chapter we consider a liquid saturated porous elastic material being fractured in a similar way .",
    "however , in such a case is the pressure distribution originating from the pore fluid flow directly coupled to the elastic equations .",
    "in the following we will outline the employed model .",
    "we give a brief description of the basic elastic and flow equations .",
    "thereafter we explain in detail the employed boundary conditions . after this",
    "we demonstrate how heterogeneous cohesive properties are taken into account .",
    "finally we present the breaking rules which contain the physics of the considered breaking process .",
    "+      there are at least two different ways of implementing porosity numerically . in both cases certain microstructural elements ( beams , plates or shells )",
    "will form a stress carrying elastic backbone .",
    "one can think , however , of two different realizations for the microstructural elements .",
    "the elements could be made of a material which already follows the constitutive laws for porous materials , e.g. biot",
    "s theory.@xmath13 this would be most satisfying from a continuum mechanical point of view as long as no fracturing occurs . however , if _ fracturing at the pore level _ is to be taken into account the above mentioned approach does not suffice ( or even becomes inconsistent ) and a micromechanical approach must be employed .",
    "the pore space / volume has to be modelled explicitely in that case .",
    "we have focussed on the latter implementation : the microstructural elements follow the classical constitutive equations of linear elasticity , and the pore space is viewed as the remaining vacant volume .",
    "the breaking of microstructural elements is associated with a coallescence of pore volume under question . because the pore volume is modelled explicitely the couplings between elastic and flow interactions ought to be derived explicitely from the microstructural configuration .",
    "+ in this paper we consider a two - dimensional model - microstructure laying on a square lattice with properties of the pore space ( hydrostatic pressure field ) defined on its dual lattice.@xmath14 +      we consider the beam model ( as defined in p.  232 of ref .",
    "[ herr90 ] ) on a two dimensional square lattice of linear size @xmath15 .",
    "this model is preferable compared to hookean spring models from a microstructural point of view because elastic beams due to their finite crossection can be physically interpreted as fibers , while hookean springs ( having zero cross section ) can not . in the two - dimensional beam model",
    "each of the lattice sites @xmath16 carries three real variables : the two translational displacements @xmath17 and @xmath18 and a rotational angle @xmath19 in the xy - plane .",
    "neighbouring sites are rigidly connected by elastic beams of length @xmath20 .",
    "the beams are assumed to have the same quadratic cross section , @xmath21 , and the same elastic behavior , governed by three material and geometry dependent constants @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 being the young and shear moduli . with characteristic values for rock materials",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 the above three constants become @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "when a site is rotated ( @xmath34 ) the beams bent accordingly always forming tangentially @xmath35 angles with each other . in this way",
    "local momenta are taken into account . for a horizontal beam between sites",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath36 one has the longitudinal force acting at site @xmath36 , @xmath37 the shear force @xmath38 and the flexural torque at site @xmath36 , @xmath39 using @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the corresponding equations for vertical beams are similar .",
    "the outline of the beam network is displayed in fig.[model_fig ] .",
    "we will not consider inertial or gravity forces , however , the flow of a pore fluid amounts in general to non - vanishing body forces .",
    "if there is a pressure drop @xmath43 across a beam ( pore wall ) the resulting line force density can be replaced by a shear force dipole , @xmath44 , acting at both ends of that beam .",
    "this follows directly from the equilibrium conditions for beams .",
    "hence the dipoles couple the pressure field in form of body forces to the mechanical equilibrium conditions .",
    "+ in mechanical equilibrium the sum over all elastic and body forces ( torques ) acting on site @xmath36 must vanish .",
    "thus if the pressure field is known one can calculate the displacements .",
    "+ to determine the hydrostatic pressure field one needs to consider flow equations .",
    "the beams exhibit a typical length @xmath20 and thickness @xmath45 and the liquid saturated equilibrium pore volume is simply @xmath46 .",
    "this states explicitly the considered material to be a _ binary _ system , i.e. any volume element is either occupied by elastic material or by pore fluid . by varying the ratio of @xmath47 different values for the volumetric porosity can be achieved ( ranging from nearly zero to nearly one ) . in order to obtain most simplified flow equations",
    ", we make the following assumtions : a ) the pore fluid is incompressible ( which appears well justified for water ) and b ) the fluid velocity relative to the bulk is proportional to the gradient of the pressure field ( darcy s relation ) . the continuity equations for solid and liquid mass density lead to the required pressure equation ( in the continuum limit ) ; @xmath48 with @xmath49 being the pressure , @xmath50 the displacement vector , @xmath51 the mechanical permeability and @xmath52 the fluid viscosity . this equation is a poisson equation for the pressure field for constant @xmath51 and @xmath52 . the right hand side of eq.([equation : pressure ] )",
    "represents in general a time - dependent source term for the pressure field .",
    "it characterizes the local rate of relative volume change due to elastic deformations , and hence the net fluid flux itself .",
    "in general these net fluid fluxes will control the pressure field s time - evolution .",
    "however , in this work we will only consider the stationary case .",
    "the physical motivation for this is the observation , that the characteristic internal relaxation time @xmath53 for water - rock systems is typically of order @xmath54 .",
    "it appears justified to assume that the time periods between sucessive breaking events are much larger than the internal relaxation time @xmath55 , and hence that breaking events are triggered by stationary pressure and displacement distributions . in connection with eq.([equation : pressure ] ) this implies to balance the net fluid flux for a given cell @xmath16 to zero ( laplacian ) ; @xmath56 here @xmath57 denotes the local permeabilities across the beams ( pore walls ) .",
    "+ the pressure equation eq.([equation : pressure_discrete ] ) is solved without referring to any mechanical properties , which is directly a consequence of explicitely dropping all dynamic terms .",
    "its solution for given boundary conditions represents the body force under which the elastic equations , among their own boundary conditions , are solved .",
    "formally the corresponding continuum problem is analogous to the standard problem of thermoelasticity@xmath58 which was already noted by biot@xmath13 . from",
    "the resulting stresses / strains and breaking thresholds ( see sec.[subsection : heterogeneities ] ) we then determine which element(s ) are broken next .",
    "+ here we would just like to mention what happens to the pressure equations , when a beam is broken . because the beams represent the pore walls , and because the fluid is assumed to be incompressible the pressure within a connected crack has to be constant . in this sense",
    "a crack is a macro - pore .",
    "numerically this can be accomplished in different ways .",
    "we have chosen to set the permeabilities for broken beams very high , i.e. @xmath59 . hence the pressure drop along a crack is negligible small .",

    "a boundary will be called ` free ' if its normal stress component vanishes and will be called ( hydrostatically ) ` loaded ' if the normal stress component follows some known non - zero stress distribution ( von neuman condition ) .",
    "a boundary is called ` fixed ' or ` clamped ' if the displacement values are assigned to the boundary ( dirichlet condition ) .",
    "a particularity in calculations are the sometimes employed ` periodic ' boundary conditions for displacements / stresses . they enforce periodic displacement / stress field solutions .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are especially useful in numerical calculations when the asymptotic behavior for infinite systems is of interest .",
    "we will encounter them in sec .",
    "[ section : rupture_without_disorder ] .    for most physical fracture problems",
    "the boundary conditions for the displacements are von neuman conditions , or mixed boundary conditions . in presence of an additional flow equation boundary conditions for the fluid pressure field need to be specified . in our case homogeneous dirichlet conditions are sufficient ,",
    "i.e. , the hydraulic crack pressure , @xmath49 , and an equilibrium pressure , @xmath63 , for the external boundary .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : hydraulic - model ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : annealed ] we describe simulations where the hydraulic crack is ` loaded ' and propagated by a constant crack pressure .",
    "the crack pressure does neither vary in space nor in time .",
    "the considered external boundaries ( lattice edges ) are either free or periodic .",
    "a , for practical purposes , somewhat more realistic boundary condition propagating a hydraulic crack is a constant fluid injection rate , @xmath64 . to keep things tractable",
    "we only consider an incompressible hydraulic fluid .",
    "the boundary condition for an impermeable crack , sec .",
    "[ subsec : impermeable ] , is a particular case of the more general permeable crack boundary condition , see below .",
    "a constant fluid injection rate @xmath64 corresponds to a certain driving pressure difference , @xmath65 , where @xmath49 denotes the hydraulic pressure within the crack and @xmath63 corresponds to an equilibrium pressure .",
    "we have used @xmath66 .",
    "the hydraulic pressure does depend on @xmath64 and the crack opening volume . for permeable cracks",
    "/ materials @xmath49 also depends on the hydraulic losses . in the following",
    "we will outline how to determine the hydraulic crack pressure @xmath49 for given injection rate @xmath64 and crack structure ( contour ) @xmath67 .    because for an incompressible fluid the conservation of fluid mass directly implies a conservation of fluid volume , it is possible to formulate a continuity equation for the crack opening volume @xmath68 , @xmath69 here @xmath70 denotes the darcy field integrated over the crack surface @xmath67 with surface element @xmath71 .",
    "as source term appears the rate of injected ( fluid ) volume , @xmath64 .",
    "because the darcy vectors are linear funtionals of the pressure , @xmath72 , and the crack opening volume is a linear fuctional of displacements , @xmath73 , and because all considered equations are linear , a scaling of the form @xmath74 implies @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "note that such a scaling is in general _ impossible _ if one considers eq .",
    "( [ equation : pressure ] ) instead of the laplacian , @xmath78 , as flow equation .",
    "there exists an interesting application of eq.([equation : nice_equation ] ) for undercritical , non - growing cracks . with @xmath79 and @xmath80 depending _ only _ on the constant crack contour @xmath67 and crack pressure @xmath81",
    "one obtains a first order differential equation for the scaling factor @xmath82 , @xmath83 with general solution , @xmath84 using    @xmath85    the important point is that one can choose an _ arbitrary _ boundary value @xmath81 within a calculation ; the resulting @xmath86 will be unique .",
    "however , one needs to calculate the contour integrals in eq .",
    "( [ equation : lambda_constants ] ) in order to do the rescaling .",
    "the magnitude @xmath87 does depend only on the injected fluid flux @xmath64 and the total fluid flux through the crack contour .",
    "it does _ not _ depend on elastic properties .",
    "the typical time scale @xmath55 , above which the crack pressure and the crack opening volume tend to approach their asymptotic values , is given by the ratio of crack volume and fluid volume flux through the crack surface .",
    "it does _ not _ depend on the injected fluid flux .",
    "again we would like to stress that the crack contour is assumed to be constant .",
    "however , eq.([equation : lambda_solution ] ) is quite general in the sense that all dependencies on the actual crack contour have been implicitly taken into account within the constants @xmath87 and @xmath55 .",
    "equation ( [ equation : lambda_solution ] ) should therefore hold for arbitrarily shaped cracks .",
    "there are two limiting cases for the practical important situation @xmath88 . for large times , @xmath89 , the scaling factor @xmath90 becomes constant and so do the crack pressure @xmath91 and the crack volume @xmath92 .",
    "the other limiting case is for small times , @xmath93 , where the scaling factor becomes linear in time , @xmath94 with corresponding pressure @xmath95 and volume @xmath96 .",
    "the latter case also holds for impermeable materials because @xmath97 .",
    "equations ( [ equation : nice_equation ] ) and ( [ equation : lambda_solution ] ) hold for _ arbitrary _ crack contours , i.e. , branched or ramified cracks .    equation [ equation : nice_equation ] has a corresponding discrete update scheme .",
    "one just needs to be careful with the time derivative in eq .",

    "the problem of fracture processes in elastic media has undergone much attention in the last years , in particular the role of disorder in such processes.@xmath111 an important question of interest is how a variation in the _ local _ properties affects the _ global _ elastic properties in comparison to ideal homogeneous media .",
    "it was recognized that elastic properties could considerably be changed and therefore interest was attracted how failure mechanisms like fracture , rupture or damage processes are influenced , changed or possibly controlled by disorder .    in the literature",
    "are two essentially different ways to take the disorder into account.@xmath112    the first possibility is to use exclusively the strain / stress field in order to calculate the probability for breaking a local constitutive element .",
