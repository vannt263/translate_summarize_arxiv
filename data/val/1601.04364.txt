    "a major problem in the context of complex networks of interacting dynamical systems , which has been considered for many years , is to predict the collective dynamics when the network topology is known .",
    "however , in many situations , it is often desirable to address the reverse problem of inferring the topology of the network from available data capturing the collective dynamics .",
    "this reverse problem is relevant in fields such as biology ( e.g. reconstructing regulatory networks from gene expression data ) , neuroimaging ( e.g. revealing the structural organization of the brain ) , and engineering ( e.g. localizing failures in power grids or computer networks ) , to list a few .",
    "network identification problems have received increasing attention over the past years , and the topic is actively growing in nonlinear systems theory .",
    "see e.g. the recent survey @xcite .",
    "many methods have been developed , exploiting techniques from various fields : linearization @xcite , velocities estimation @xcite , adaptive control @xcite , steady - state control @xcite , optimization @xcite , compressed sensing @xcite , stochastic methods @xcite , etc .",
    "these methods provide the structural ( i.e. exact ) connectivity of the underlying network and exploit to do so the dynamical nature of the individual units , which is often known , at least partially .",
    "in contrast , correlation - based methods using statistical measures @xcite or information - theoretic measures @xcite have also been developed , but they can only infer the effective ( i.e. statistical ) connectivity of the network .",
    "network identification methods developed in the framework of dynamical systems theory are usually not well - suited to the analysis of real networks such as biological networks , social networks , etc .",
    "most of them are invasive , requiring the modification of the network connectivity or dynamics .",
    "in addition , some of them can not be used `` offline '' for data analysis , since they require to interact dynamically with the network .",
    "more importantly , all the methods proposed so far for full network reconstruction require measurements at all the nodes of the network .",
    "partial measurements have been considered in @xcite in the context of linear time - invariant systems for a partial reconstruction of the network between the measured states , and yet the authors showed that the problem can not be solved without additional information on the system .",
    "it can actually be shown that measuring all nodes is necessary for a full network reconstruction , and this is usually out of reach in large real networks . indeed",
    ", the number of sensors is limited and typically ( much ) smaller that the number of nodes . some nodes of real networks might also not be accessible , or the only available information might be the averaged activity of a group of nodes lying in a given region of the network ( e.g. electrical activity in a region of the brain ) .",
    "all these limitations motivate the network identification framework developed in this paper , which overcomes them .    in this work ,",
    "we take the view that identifying the exact complete topology of large networks is not only practically impossible , as mentioned above , but also often unnecessary .",
    "the presence or absence of an edge between two specific nodes is for instance often only marginally relevant when analyzing the global structure of a large network .",
    "for this reason , we focus instead on the identification of the spectral properties of the network , a framework that we call _ spectral network identification_. note that the idea of estimating the spectral properties of networks has been considered in the control theory community ( e.g. @xcite ) , but in the case of specific ( linear ) consensus dynamics imposed at each node . on one hand , spectral properties do not reveal the exact full network topology ( indeed , we can not `` hear the shape '' of a drum @xcite ) , so that the identification objective has been relaxed . on the other hand , they are a central theme of study in spectral graph theory @xcite where they are typically defined through the so - called laplacian matrix associated with the network . they are shown to provide relevant information on the global network structure such as mean , minimum and maximum node degree , and connectivity , and they are reflected on the network dynamics , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "for instance , the second smallest eigenvalue of the laplacian matrix also called algebraic connectivity is related to the speed of information diffusion in the network ( e.g. opinion propagation , spreading of epidemics ) and plays a key role in studying network synchronization .",
    "more generally , the spectral properties of the network provide simple markers capturing the global network structure .",
    "these spectral markers can be used to detect a pathology or a fault and to compare different networks .    while classical full topology identification requires measurements at all the nodes of the network ,",
    "we show that spectral network identification requires only sparse measurements in the network .",
    "this can be roughly explained by the fact that each node of a strongly connected network `` feels '' the influence of all the other nodes . with the method developed in this paper , measurements",
    "can therefore be performed on a very small subset of nodes ( e.g. only one in some cases ) that might not be representative of the whole set of nodes .",
    "they can also be defined by a possibly nonlinear function of the states of several nodes , such as the average dynamics of a group of units . moreover ,",
    "the proposed method is not invasive and can be used offline .",
    "spectral properties of ( nonlinear ) dynamics are well - defined in a framework based on the so - called koopman operator @xcite and can be extracted from data through numerical methods such as the dynamic mode decomposition ( dmd ) algorithm @xcite . in this context",
    ", our main theoretical contribution is to connect these spectral properties of the collective network dynamics , which are measured , to the spectral properties of the network , which are to be inferred .",
    "these results are obtained in the case of a diffusive coupling for networks reaching a synchronized equilibrium , where the states of all units converge to the same value , a behavior which can be observed with excitable neurons , cardiac cells , opinion dynamics , and epidemics . for small networks ,",
    "exact spectral identification is achieved . for large networks ,",
    "a statistical approach is proposed , which focuses on spectral moments and is well - suited to the case of heterogeneous populations . with a few sparse measurements in the network , this framework allows to estimate the average number of connections , detect the addition of a node to the network , and measure whether two units influence each other .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : problem_stat ] , the problem of spectral network identification is introduced . in section [ sec : exact ] , theoretical results are presented in the case of linear and nonlinear networks . at the end of the section",
    ", we also discuss the limitations encountered for the exact spectral identification of non - identical units .",
    "section [ sec : stat ] focuses on large networks and provides statistical results related to the spectral moments of the laplacian matrix , which are related to the statistical distribution of the node degrees .",
    "numerical aspects of the methods are discussed in section [ sec : numerical ] and illustrated with several applications in section [ sec : examples ] .",
    "concluding remarks and perspectives are given in section [ sec : conclu ] .",
    "a networked dynamical system consists of a set of @xmath0 interconnected dynamical systems ( or units ) interacting on a ( weighted ) graph @xmath1 .",
    "the system is deterministic since no stochastic perturbation is considered .",
    "each unit is attached to a node ( or vertex ) @xmath2 and is directly influenced by another unit @xmath3 if @xmath4 is an edge of the graph , i.e. @xmath5 . the strength of the interaction between units is determined by the function @xmath6 which assigns a weight to each edge .",

    "here we are interested in the following network identification problem : under the assumption that ( ii ) and ( iii ) are known , infer the graph topology ( i ) from measurements of the state of the units .",

    "we focus on networked systems that admit a stable equilibrium corresponding to the synchronization of the units .",
    "we also make the standing assumption that the units interact through a diffusive coupling .",
    "in contrast to classical network identification , spectral network identification only requires sparse measurements in the network .",
    "the price to pay is the relaxed objective of getting only the laplacian eigenvalues .",
    "although this spectral information does not reveal the complete graph structure , it captures important topological properties of the network .",
    "we will not review the vast literature related to spectral graph theory ( we refer the interested reader to @xcite ) , but provide here some basic results connecting the laplacian spectrum to the topological properties of the graph .    in the case of a connected graph ,",
    "the second smallest eigenvalue @xmath33called algebraic connectivity  captures the connectivity of the graph ; see also the cheeger inequality in undirected graphs .",
    "the algebraic connectivity is related to the time constant of the dominant dynamics and to the speed of information propagation in the network .",
    "it also provides a bound on the diameter of the graph , i.e. the longest path between any pair of vertices @xcite .",
    "moreover , the algebraic connectivity @xmath33 and the spectral radius @xmath34 ( i.e. the largest eigenvalue ) can be used to derive bounds on the minimal and maximal vertex degrees @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in particular , for an undirected graph , we have @xcite @xmath37    in the case of large graphs , it is convenient to consider the spectral moments @xmath38 which are related to the moments of the degree distribution .",
    "the first spectral moment is equal to the mean vertex degree @xmath39 , i.e. @xmath40 and the first and second spectral moments give bounds on the quadratic mean of the degree distribution @xmath41 : @xmath42 the equality is trivial and a short proof of the inequalities is given in appendix [ sec : app_proofs ] . in the case of undirected and unweighted graphs , other relationships can be derived , which link the spectral moments of @xmath31 to local structural features of the network @xcite .",
    "in this section , we develop the spectral network identification framework in the case of identical units . we first consider linear systems and then extend the results to nonlinear dynamics .",

    "the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm will be illustrated in the sequel through several examples .",
    "the dmd algorithm works in practice with a set of time series obtained with several initial conditions .",
    "we therefore assume that measurements are performed while the network is reset several times to a state different from its equilibrium point .",
    "accurate results can also be obtained when only the states of a group of vertices are reset , provided that this group is large enough . in the sequel",
    ", we will however consider that all the states of the network are reset ( as it happens for instance in real networks of excitable neurons or cardiac cells ) .",

    ", it can be shown that @xmath232 if the perturbation @xmath233 is small enough , so that the spectral identification problem can be solved exactly .",
    "however this situation is very restrictive . for more general graphs ,",
    "perturbation theory for matrix eigenvalues @xcite can provide upper bounds on the difference between the eigenvalues of @xmath58 and @xmath228 , but these bounds are too conservative , especially when the network is large .",
    "it is also noticeable that the linearized dynamics of identical agents that do not synchronize but converge to different equilibria are in general equivalent to the ( linear ) dynamics of non - identical agents .",
    "in such a case , we would thus encounter similar issues when inferring the spectral properties of the network .    in the next section ,",
    "we show that a statistical approach can circumvent these limitations in the case of large networks .",
    "in the case of large graphs , most individual laplacian eigenvalues have an insignificant influence on the network dynamics , making them very hard to identify precisely .",
    "on the other hand , each of them taken individually only captures a very small amount of information about the network structure . therefore , recovering each individual eigenvalue is on the one hand impractical but on the other hand not really necessary . instead , it is much more relevant and convenient to focus on statistical measures of the spectral density of the laplacian matrix . in this section",
    ", we show that one can estimate the first spectral moments of the laplacian matrix from sparse measurements in the network .",
    "these spectral moments are related to statistical information on the degree distribution of the vertices ( see section [ sec : exact ] ) .",
    "this approach is also well - suited to the case of non - identical units and can be used to obtain some information on the unweighted underlying graph .      from a few eigenvalues of @xmath78 obtained with the dmd algorithm",
    ", one can compute the spectral moments of @xmath58 ; see section [ sec : approx_spec_mom ] for details on the numerical method .",

    ", we have @xmath175 , @xmath176 , and @xmath177",
    ".    we will focus on the first two moments and it follows from proposition [ prop : moments ] that @xmath237 and @xmath238    [ example3 ] we consider a random erds - rnyi graph with @xmath239 vertices and a probability @xmath240 ( supposedly not known ) for any two vertices to be connected .",

    "the local dynamics of the units is given by and the observation function is @xmath149 , corresponding to the measurement of one state of one unit .",
    "note that the dynamics are linear , a choice made to provide the best illustration of the theoretical results .",
    "examples of identification of large networks with nonlinear dynamics are shown in section [ sec : examples ] .",
    "we use a heuristic method to estimate the spectral moments of @xmath58 ( figure [ fig : example3 ] ) , approximating the clusters of eigenvalues by the convex hull of values obtained with the dmd algorithm and assuming a uniform distribution of the eigenvalues within each cluster ; see section [ sec : approx_spec_mom ] for more details on the method . using and , we finally obtain the spectral moments @xmath242 and @xmath243 , which are close to the exact values . from and , one obtains good approximations of the mean degree @xmath244 and quadratic mean degree @xmath245 .",
