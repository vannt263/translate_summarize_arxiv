    "the quasiparticle bandstructure @xmath0 , which reflects the peaks of the spectral function @xmath1 depending on energy and wavevector @xmath2 , is the key property of the crystalline solids .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission ( pe ) spectroscopy ( for reviews see , e.g. , kevan92,hufner95 ) is the main experimental method to map @xmath0 with resolution in energy @xmath3 and , in principle , in the 3-dimensional @xmath4 ( _ 3d band mapping _ ) .",
    "this is based on conservation of @xmath4 in the process of photoexcitation from the occupied initial state to unoccupied final state in the bulk of the crystal .",
    "however , the pe experiment is inherently performed on the crystal terminated by the surface . by virtue of the remaining surface - parallel periodicity",
    ", the surface - parallel wavevector @xmath5 is conserved in the whole system and can be determined from the surface - parallel vacuum wavevector @xmath6 with the accuracy limited only by instrumental resolution . as the surface - perpendicular periodicity is however broken , the surface - perpendicular wavevector @xmath7 is not conserved in the whole system and can not be directly determined .",
    "control over @xmath7 is therefore a fundamental problem of 3d band mapping .",
    "the control over @xmath7 has two aspects .",
    "first , @xmath7 is distorted when the photoelectrons exit from the bulk of the solid into vacuum .",
    "as @xmath7 is conserved in the very photoexcitation process in the bulk , it can nevertheless be recovered if the @xmath8-dispersion of the final state @xmath9 or that of the initial state @xmath10 back in the bulk is known .",
    "commonly an empirical free - electron - like approximation is used here for the final states , though the accuracy of this can often be insufficient .",
    "nevertheless , the true quasiparticle @xmath9 including the non - free - electron and self - energy effects in the final state can be determined using very - low - energy electron diffraction ( vleed ) spectroscopy ( see exi , tmdcs , cfs and references therein ) based on that the pe final states , as proved by the one - step theory of pe , are the time - reversed leed states @xcite .",
    "it is a common point of view that knowledge of the final - state @xmath0 exhaust the whole problem of 3d band mapping .",
    "indeed , variation of the final - state energy @xmath11 in the pe experiment ( commonly achieved by variation of the photon energy @xmath12 ) would through known @xmath9 be translated into variations of @xmath8 , and accurate 3d mapping of the occupied @xmath0 would be performed .",
    "there is another aspect however .",
    "due to inelastic absorption and elastic reflection from the crystal potential the pe final state is intrinsically damped towards interior of the solid @xcite .",
    "such a confinement in the surface - perpendicular coordinate is equivalent , by the uncertainty principle , to certain _ intrinsic broadening in _ @xmath7 .",
    "the pe signal via this final state is then formed by all initial states within the @xmath7-broadening interval , and the pe peak reflects an average of the quasiparticle @xmath13 in the valence band .",
    "a difference of the measured averaged @xmath7-dispersion from the true @xmath10 limits _ intrinsic accuracy _ of 3d band mapping .",
    "it is borne by fundamental physics of the pe process , and can not be improved instrumentally .",
    "the intrinsic accuracy appears thus as an _ extrinsic _ factor to the excited - state self - energy effects as deviations of the quasiparticle excited - state @xmath0 , measured in the ideal pe experiment with undamped final states , from the ground - state bandstructure .",
    "the intrinsic accuracy problem has in pieces been tackled in quite a few papers . here , my aim is to delineate an entire concept , including essential physics and mechanisms of the intrinsic accuracy , and unveil its non - trivial effects encountered in the pe experiment .",
    "the concept is built upon a simple picture involving interplay of the final- and initial - state spectral functions , which gives a clearer physical insight compared to the explicit one - step pe theory with its heavy computational machinery .",
    "finally , i discuss optimization of the pe experiment with respect to the intrinsic accuracy of 3d band mapping .",
    "in the following analysis of the pe process it is implied that @xmath0 is the quasiparticle bandstructure , already incorporating the excited - state self - energy effects .",
    "we will neglect the surface effects and concentrate on the bulk derived states with significant dispersion in @xmath7 ( so - called _",
    "3d states _ ) . the ideal @xmath3- and @xmath14-resolution of the pe experiment is assumed .",
    "first we will recall physics of the pe initial and final states based on the ideas from @xcite . for simplicity we will assume that their wavefunctions have only one bloch wave constituent .",
    "the final - state wavefunction is the time - reversed leed wavefunction .",
    "as sketched in fig.1 ( the upper panels represent the final state ) , the wavefunction is described by a bloch wave which is damped in the surface - perpendicular direction @xmath15 towards the crystal interior @xcite .",
    "there are two sources of such damping : 1 ) inelastic absorption , expressed by absorption potential @xmath16 connected with the electron lifetime as @xmath17 @xmath18 , and 2 ) elastic reflection from the crystal potential in the final - state band gaps .",
    "the damping is described by complex @xmath19 component of the final - state wavevector @xmath20 , with @xmath21 connected to the photoelectron escape length @xmath22 as @xmath23 ( the factor of 2 comes from squaring the wavefunction amplitude for intensity ) .",
    "the corresponding final - state dispersion @xmath9 , shown in fig.1 by black lines , is radically different from this one if the bloch waves were undamped ( propagating ) , as shown in gray : the dispersions as a function of @xmath24 are smooth and _ gapless _ , passing continuously through the band gaps of the undamped @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "such regions will in the following be somewhat loosely referred to as final - state band gaps .",
    "note that due to surface - parallel invariance of the pe process the bloch waves are undamped in the surface - parallel direction , retaining real @xmath14 and gapped @xmath14-dispersions @xcite .",
    "the final - state spectral function @xmath25 , due to the finite photoelectron lifetime , is in principle characterized by certain distribution in @xmath3 . however , in the pe experiment this is reduced to the @xmath26-function at the energy given by the pe  analyser . due to damping of the final - state wavefunction @xmath25 is characterized , on the contrary , by lorentzian distribution in real @xmath8 , as shown in fig.1 , centered at @xmath27 of the final - state bloch wave and having the fullwidth @xmath28 ( in the angle - resolved pe experiment @xmath14 is fixed and can be omitted ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath25 is given by @xmath29where the nominator stands for the normalization @xmath30 .",
    "the final state of pe  is thus characterized by _ fixed _",
    "@xmath3 _  and broadening in _",
    "@xmath8 whose width is determined by @xmath21 of the damped final - state bloch wave @xcite .",
    "nature of the pe initial state is different and complementary .",
    "the initial - state wavefunction is basically undamped : removal of holes by the finite hole lifetime is compensated by their simultaneous generation by the electromagnetic field , which is almost homogeneous , extending into the crystal interior over a light absorption length of @xmath31100  , very large compared to the final - state damping length .",
    "as sketched in fig.1 ( the lower panels represent the initial state ) , initial - state wavefunction is therefore described by an almost undamped bloch wave , having well - defined real @xmath8 .",
    "the corresponding initial - state dispersion @xmath13 shows up sharp and _ gapped _",
    "@xmath8-dispersions typical of the undamped states , radically different from the final - state .",
    "the initial - state spectral function @xmath32 is characterized , owing to well - defined @xmath8 , by distribution in real @xmath8 reduced to the @xmath33-function .",
    "due to finite hole lifetime @xmath34 it is characterized , on the contrary , by lorentzian distribution in energy , as shown in fig.1 , centered at the band energy @xmath13 and having the fullwidth @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , @xmath32 is given by@xmath36where the nominator ensures @xmath37 .",
    "the initial state of pe is thus characterized , complementarily to the final state , by _ fixed _",
    "@xmath7 _  and broadening in _",
    "@xmath3 whose width is determined by the hole lifetime @xcite .",
    "note that some implementations of the one - step pe theory pendry76,nilsson80 describe the hole lifetime effects by damping of the initial states .",
    "however , such an approach is in clear contradiction with the pe experiment , which unambiguously finds in the valence band the gapped @xmath10 dispersions typical of undamped states .",
    "the same fundamental flaw is implied by an pe lineshape analysis ( see , e.g. , knapp79,smith93 ) where the @xmath3-broadening of the initial state is replaced by an equivalent @xmath7-broadening @xmath38 .",
    "although such a replacement does not alter the lineshape while the @xmath8-dispersions remain linear , it leaves out some of the intrinsic effects discussed here .",
    "inverse photoemission ( ipe ) is commonly treated as the time - reversed pe process @xcite in which the ipe final state in the conduction band is equivalent to the pe initial state in the valence band .",
    "however , the above arguments suggest a fundamental difference between the two : as the ipe  final state is excited by the damped leed wavefunction , it is , in contrast to the pe  initial state , also damped . correspondingly , the conduction band @xmath0 measured in the ipe experiment should be characterized by gapless @xmath7-dispersions similar to the pe final - state dispersions in fig.1 .",
    "surprisingly , such a fundamental difference between the ipe and pe processes , tracing back to fundamental principles of quantum mechanics , has so far been addressed nor theoretically neither experimentally .",
    "we will now apply the above principles to analyze the pe response of 3d states .",
    "we will use a simple formalism based on interplay of the spectral functions @xcite , which is extremely simple and gives a clear physical insight .",
    "its accuracy , despite principal limitations compared to the explicit one - step pe theory ( see [ onestep ] ) , is nevertheless sufficient for evaluation of the pe peak profiles @xcite .",
    "as illustrated in fig.2 , the photoemission current @xmath39 at the final - state energy @xmath11 and initial - state energy @xmath40 is formed by adding up the elementary photocurrents @xmath41 from all @xmath42 intervals , in which direct transitions take place , with @xmath43 spanning the whole brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "each @xmath41 is weighted by the above spectral functions , @xmath44 to express closeness of @xmath8 to @xmath45 of the final - state bloch wave , and @xmath46 to express closeness of @xmath47 to the initial - state band energy @xmath13 at this @xmath8 with @xmath48 varying along @xmath10 . moreover",
    ", each @xmath41 is multiplied by amplitude factors of the final - state surface transmission @xmath49 and photoexcitation matrix element @xmath50 .",
    "this yields @xmath51 . to obtain the whole photocurrent ,",
    "this expression should be integrated in @xmath52 : @xmath53this integral can be evaluated at negligible computational cost ( it can even be performed analytically using taylor expansion of @xmath13 cfs )",
    ".    cuts of @xmath39 along the @xmath54 line correspond to the constant - final - state ( cfs ) measurement mode , along the @xmath55 line to the energy - distribution - curve ( edc ) mode , and along @xmath56 to the constant - initial - state ( cis ) mode .",
    "fig.2 illustrates , for simplicity , the pe spectrum taken using the cfs mode in which @xmath45 is constant throughout the spectrum .",
    "the pe spectrum shows up , whichever the measurement mode , a peak centered roughly at the energy @xmath57 dictated by the direct transition at @xmath45 between the final and initial bands .",
    "broadening of the peak results from the final - state @xmath8-broadening combined with the initial - state @xmath3-broadening . in this context",
    "the @xmath43-broadening appears as an _ intrinsic _ @xmath8_-resolution _ of the pe experiment ( in the following we will use these terms interchangeably depending on the context ) . note that this resolution , in contrast to the instrumentally limited resolution in @xmath14 , is limited by intrinsic mechanisms involved in the pe process and can not be improved instrumentally .",
    "if the @xmath7-resolution is at its best extreme @xmath58 , then @xmath59 becomes @xmath26-function @xmath60 and the integral ( intf ) for @xmath39 is reduced to @xmath61 whose maximum points to the initial band energy @xmath57 in the @xmath2-point dictated by the direct transition .",
    "the pe peaks will then exactly follow the 3d quasiparticle dispersions in the valence band . in practice",
    ", such a situation is realized under the condition@xmath62where @xmath63 is the surface - perpendicular dimension of the bz .",
    "this condition identifies the so - called _ bandstructure regime _",
    "( bs - regime ) of the pe experiment which ensures accurate 3d band mapping hufner95,feibelman74 . in the real space",
    ", it reads as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the surface - perpendicular dimension of the unit cell .",
    "if the pe final state comprise a few bloch waves , the condition ( bsregime ) should be generalized as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the number of the corresponding final bands . often in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) this number is confused with the number of _ all _ unoccupied bands available for given @xmath11 and @xmath14 ; as the latter becomes with energy progressively immense , an erroneous conjecture is made that at high energies any 3d band mapping is impossible .",
    "however , in the multitude of the available unoccupied bands only those are effective as the final bands , whose bloch waves provide effective transport of the photoelectrons out of the solid by significant coupling to the outgoing plane wave @xcite . typically there are only a few ( @xmath68 ) final bands in this sense ( see examples in non - linearity ) .",
    "if the @xmath7-resolution is at the opposite extreme @xmath69 , any resolution in @xmath8 is lost , @xmath70 becomes constant and the integral ( [ intf ] ) yields , assuming that @xmath49 and @xmath50 are independent of @xmath8 and @xmath13 is linear , the 1-dimensional dos ( 1dos ) @xmath71 .",
    "the pe peaks will then manifest the 1dos maxima independently of @xmath45 . in practice",
    ", such a situation is achieved under the condition @xmath72 , which identifies the so - called _ 1dos - regime _ @xcite .",
    "interpretation of the pe data between the bandstructure and 1dos regimes is doubtful @xcite : the pe peaks retain some @xmath12-dispersion , although damped by strong averaging in @xmath8 , but they can be far from the true quasiparticle @xmath13 .",
    "evolution of the regimes of the pe experiment with the @xmath7-resolution will now be illustrated by a pe simulation .",
    "the model employs the initial state whose parameters are chosen to resemble roughly the _",
    "sp_-band of cu @xcite : it is described by the free - electron dispersion @xmath73 and the energy broadening @xmath48 varying linearly as a function of energy to match zero at the fermi level @xmath74 and an experimental value of 1.7 ev at the bottom of the band .",
    "the fermi - dirac cut is introduced as the ideal step function .",
    "the photocurrent @xmath39 is evaluated by integration of the spectral functions in @xmath8 ( [ intf ] ) , assuming constant amplitude factors @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the integration also extends above the fermi vector @xmath75 to include certain contribution from the tails of @xmath76 in the unoccupied region of the valence band ( see [ ghost ] ) . for clarity",
    ", the pe spectra were evaluated for the cfs mode , in which @xmath45 is constant ( deviations from the edc  mode are insignificant , because normally the final - state @xmath77 is large enough to ensure small variations of @xmath45 through the peak profile ) .",
    "the simulation was performed for four @xmath78 values :  zero for the ideal @xmath7-resolution , @xmath79@xmath80 as a representative for the bs - regime in a real pe experiment , @xmath81@xmath80 for degraded @xmath7-resolution , and @xmath82@xmath80 for the 1dos - regime .",
    "the results are shown in fig.3 as series of the pe spectra with @xmath45 scanning along @xmath80 ( upper panels , each series in different intensity scale ) and positions of the spectral peaks mapped on top of the true valence band ( lower panels ) .    in the ideal @xmath7-resolution limit",
    "the pe peak reflects the initial - state @xmath61 and ideally follows the true @xmath83 .",
    "interestingly , upon passing @xmath75 there appears an extremely small peak just below @xmath74 ; it replicates the low - energy tail of the spectral function @xmath76 whose maximum is already above @xmath74 ( see [ ghost ] ) .    in the bs - regime ( @xmath84@xmath80 in our simulation )",
    "the @xmath7-resolution remains sufficient for the pe peaks to closely follow @xmath13 .",
    "this regime can be used for accurate 3d band mapping .",
    "two peculiarities should be noted here : 1 ) despite @xmath76 becomes the @xmath33-function upon approaching @xmath74 , the pepeak does not sharpen up to singularity ; 2 ) when @xmath45 passes @xmath85 and enters into the unoccupied region , the peaks do not disappear but become ghost peaks which are highly asymmetric and have their maximum stationary in energy just below @xmath74 .",
    "both peculiarities are appearances of the @xmath7-broadening and will be analyzed in ghost and [ lineshapes ] .    as the @xmath7-resolution degrades ( @xmath86@xmath80 ) , the concomitant averaging of @xmath13 causes asymmetry of the peaks and strong _ intrinsic shifts _ of their maxima from the true @xmath10 .",
    "although the pe peaks deceptively keep dispersion on @xmath87 , their use for 3d band mapping will return a distorted valence band dispersion .",
    "note appearance of an additional shoulder - like structure , which originates from the large 1dos in the bottom of the band and becomes notable as the main peak shifts upwards .",
    "in the 1dos - regime ( @xmath88@xmath80 ) the @xmath7-resolution is completely lost .",
    "the maxima of the pepeaks become stationary in energy reflecting the maximum of the valence band 1dos ( and a tiny replica of the @xmath76 singularity at @xmath74 , omitted from the plot ) .",
    "the @xmath45 changes show up only in the intensity modulation .",
    "note however that the pe  peaks are notably shifted from the true 1dos maximum .",
    "the regimes of the pe experiment in general follow the well - known  universal curve  @xmath89 @xcite which gives the @xmath8-resolution as @xmath90 .",
    "the bs - regime holds while @xmath22 remains large , which takes place at low @xmath91 below or not far above a plasmon excitation energy of 20 - 30 ev ( see examples in [ non - linearity ] ) . upon further increase of energy @xmath22 reaches its minimum around 50 - 100 ev , and",
    "the pe experiment enters into the 1dos - regime , although in practice the @xmath8-dispersion signatures are never completely suppressed .",
    "the bs - regime recovers in the high - energy region above @xmath92 ev where @xmath22 rises again ( despite at these energies the unoccupied bands become immense in number , only one of them remains effective in the pe final state in the sense of effective coupling to the outgoing plane wave @xcite ) .",
    "the high - energy region is characterized by low pe intensity resulting from small valence band crossection and from the debye - waller factor , in which the increase of @xmath12 reduces the pe intensity on equal footing with temperature .",
    "however , the advent of new high - brilliance synchrotron radiation sources and multidetection pe analysers has allowed for peexperiments in this region with reasonable count rates and resolution in @xmath3 and @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "@xmath4-resolved experiments were reported , for example , in @xcite where the @xmath93-band of al was found to be mirrored in the @xmath12-dispersion of the pe signal up to 750 ev .",
    "interestingly , this study has found an increase of the surface to bulk signal intensity ratio with @xmath12 , opposite to the tendency expected from the  universal curve  , and attributed this surprising phenomenon to intrinsic phonon excitation effects involved in the pe  process .",
    "these results call for further studies on the role of the phonon excitation in high - energy pe spectroscopy .",
    "degradation of the @xmath8-resolution , as we observed above , results in intrinsic shifts of pe peaks from the true valence band @xmath8-dispersions , limiting the _ intrinsic accuracy _ of 3d band mapping .",
    "these shifts can originate through various mechanisms , which will now be analyzed .",
    "degradation of the @xmath8-resolution can crawl into the position of the pe peaks , firstly , by non - linearity of the valence band @xmath8-dispersion . as evident from fig.2 , in this case the integral number of the @xmath94-intervals within the @xmath8-broadening will be different for the initial states whose @xmath47 is above the direct - transition energy @xmath57 and for the states whose @xmath47 is below @xmath57 , being larger where the 1dos is larger . correspondingly , the pe peak becomes asymmetric .",
    "its maximum somewhat shifts towards larger integral number of @xmath94 , deviating from the true @xmath57 . in the band interior the pe peaks shift towards the band edges , where the 1dos is larger . near the band edges the peaks , on the opposite , shift towards the band interior ( so - called in - band shifting @xcite ) because beyond the band edge there are no states and the 1dos is zero .",
    "we will refer to this mechanism to limit the intrinsic accuracy as the _ non - linearity _ mechanism .",
    "it was behind the intrinsic shifts observed in the pe simulation in fig.3 , where the pe peaks clearly followed the characteristic pattern of shifting towards larger 1dos .",
    "note that the intrinsic shifts due to the non - linearity mechanism depend , apart from @xmath78 and non - linearity of @xmath13 , on the initial - state @xmath48 .",
    "the non - linearity mechanism can be illustrated by experimental data for vse@xmath95 ( for a detailed discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "information about the final - state dispersions and lifetimes , required for determination of @xmath96 , was achieved in this case by vleed ( see [ optim ] ) .",
    "the experimental energy dependence of @xmath16 is shown in fig .",
    "4 ( _ a _ ) .",
    "it is characterized by a sharp increases of @xmath16 at the plasmon excitation energy @xmath97 .",
    "the experimental @xmath9 is shown in fig . 4 ( _ b _ ) .",
    "note that these final band can hardly be described by free - electron - like dispersions : there are _ two _ bands , and each can be free - electron fitted only locally with the inner potential strongly depending on @xmath11 and @xmath14 ( such a complicated structure of the final states is in fact typical of many materials with large unit cell , containing more than one atom , due to backfolding of many free - electron bands into the first bz and their mutual hybridization ) .",
    "an estimate of @xmath78 was obtained , neglecting some increase in the final - state band gaps , as @xmath98 ( see [ optim ] ) .",
    "the obtained @xmath78 values are shown in fig .",
    "4 ( _ b _ ) superimposed on the final bands . following the increase of @xmath16 , the @xmath8-resolution degrades above @xmath97 . the results of pe band mapping , the binding energy of the pe peaks as a function of @xmath45 , are shown in fig .",
    "4 ( _ c _ ) with distinction for the final states below and above @xmath97 .",
    "near the band edges of the 3d bands the experimental points above @xmath99 are systematically shifted towards the band interior compared to those below @xmath97 . it should be stressed that here we have an explicit example how _ the same _ initial states yield _ different _ energies of the pe peaks depending on the @xmath8-resolution .",
    "the observed shifts demonstrate the intrinsic effect of in - band shifting , occurring mainly by the non - linearity mechanism .",
    "interestingly , increase of @xmath91 towards 50 ev results in further increase of @xmath78 and suppression of any dispersion of the pe peaks @xcite .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that for vse@xmath100 the energy region of accurate 3d band mapping is exhausted by low @xmath11 below or not far above @xmath99 .",
    "such a situation is in fact fairly general , because a pronounced plasmon threshold is typical of many materials with some exceptions such as cu and ni .",
    "the intrinsic accuracy effects similar to vse@xmath95 were also observed for tis@xmath100 @xcite , wse@xmath100 finteis97 , ge @xcite , etc .    in the final - state band gaps",
    "the bloch waves experience additional damping due to elastic scattering from the crystal potential @xcite .",
    "although this is normally much weaker than the damping due to @xmath16 , as in the above example , for materials with exceptionally large final - state band gaps the additional damping can cause notable degradation of the @xmath8-resolution .",
    "graphite is a typical example of this ( for a detailed discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "its final bands were simulated using the empirical pseudopotential method based on the vleed data for their energies in the @xmath101-point ( the simulation is therefore less accurate in the bz interior ) and @xmath16 .",
    "the resulting @xmath9 is shown in fig.5 ( _ a _ ) and ( _ b _ ) as a function of @xmath21 and @xmath24 , respectively , using the double - bz representation to reflect the dipole selection rules in graphite .",
    "the final states are characterized by a strong increase of @xmath28 in the two band gaps in the @xmath101-point .",
    "based on these data , we simulated the pe response of the valence @xmath102-band , having the 3d character , using the same formalism ( [ intf ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig.5 ( _ b _ ) . when the final - state @xmath45 moves towards the @xmath101-point and enters the band gaps , progressive degradation of the @xmath8-resolution results , by the non - linearity mechanism , in increasing of the in - band shifts . in the lower band gap , which has the maximal width ,",
    "the increase of @xmath103 is particularly strong ; the concomitant in - band shifting is so dramatic that it overcomes the trend dictated by the band dispersions themselves and _ reverses _ the dispersion of the pe peaks compared to the true @xmath102-band .",
    "such an unusual reversed dispersion has indeed been found in the pe experiment @xcite .",
    "typically , intrinsic shifts near the band extrema due to the non - linearity mechanism are of the order of a few tenths of ev .",
    "the experiment often suggests however larger shifts @xcite . as degradation of",
    "the @xmath8-resolution goes along with reduction of the escape length @xmath22 , this reveals certain contribution of surface effects such as suppression of the 1dos in the band extrema ( see [ other ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the condition ( [ bsregime ] ) identifying the bs - regime is particularly restrictive for layered materials owing to their small @xmath63 ( see @xcite for a specialized survey ) .",
    "an interesting phenomenon occurs when a 3d band crosses the fermi surface .",
    "this situation is described by the pe simulation in fig.3 : when the direct - transition @xmath45 moves outside the fermi surface and starts sampling the unoccupied part of the valence band , the pe peaks , mysteriously , do not disappear . instead , they become asymmetric and stationary in energy just below the fermi level @xmath74 , and only gradually reduce in amplitude .",
    "experimentally , such a phenomenon has been observed , for example , in a famous pe study on na , where the @xmath93-band crosses @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "we will refer to this phenomenon as _",
    "peaks_. it has in fact two contributions due to different mechanisms .",
    "the first contribution is due to a general mechanism taking place for 3d as well as 2d bands .",
    "it comes from the _ unoccupied _ states next to @xmath74 : the spectral function @xmath76 , centered at the band energy above @xmath74 , protrudes its low - energy tail , however small the remaining amplitude , below @xmath104 and gives therefore some pe intensity ( such an effect for 2d bands is discussed , for example , in @xcite ) .",
    "such a contribution can be isolated in our pe simulation by restricting the integration ( [ intf ] ) to @xmath105 .",
    "it survives even in the limit of the ideal @xmath7-resolution , see fig.3 . in any case , the ghost peak intensity due this mechanism is very small .",
    "the second contribution , much predominating for the 3d bands , comes from the occupied states : as illustrated in fig.6 , even if @xmath45 moves outside the fermi surface , the @xmath94-states at the initial - state @xmath106 below @xmath74 give certain ghost intensity by virtue of being accessible via the @xmath7-broadening . upon moving @xmath45",
    "further from @xmath75 the @xmath59 profile shifts , reducing its amplitude at the initial band and , concomitanly , the ghost peak amplitude .",
    "note that this mechanism gives a significant ghost peak intensity even if the initial - state @xmath3-broadening is vanishing which takes place upon approaching @xmath74 .",
    "the ghost peak phenomenon complicates identification of the @xmath74 crossings in mapping of the fermi surface formed by 3d bands .",
    "a well - known example is nbse@xmath100 , whose 4_p_@xmath107 band forms a 3d pocket of the fermi surface with extension in @xmath8 small compared to the @xmath8-broadening ; direct mapping of this pocket is precluded by non - dispersive ghost intensity @xcite .",
    "even if the mapping is performed as a function of @xmath14 , the ghost peaks stay at @xmath74 through the entire interval of @xmath14 where at least some part of the 3d band remains occupied .",
    "it should be noted that often the pe data , especially for quasi-2d materials , is interpreted neglecting the 3d effects ; in this case such ghost peaks in the @xmath14-dispersion are misinterpreted as a sign of unusual self - energy effects . a way to circumvent the ghost peak problem in the fermi surface mapping",
    "was suggested in @xcite : one varies @xmath14 , simultaneously changing @xmath11 to remain in the @xmath108 minimum .",
    "similar in origin to the ghost peaks is an interesting pe linewidth behavior upon approaching @xmath74 : as seen in our simulations in fig.3 for the bs - regime , the pe peak from the 3d band , mysteriously , retains a finite linewidth up to @xmath74 without sharpening up as might be expected from the behavior of the initial - state @xmath76 , which becomes singular at @xmath74 because of the vanishing @xmath3-broadening .",
    "the origin of such a counter - intuitive linewidth behavior is again due to the 3d character of the band and the @xmath7-broadening @xcite : as one can conjecture from fig.6 , even if the @xmath3-broadening is zero , the initial states around the direct - transition energy @xmath57 are accessible via the @xmath7-broadening and contribute to the pe peak width .",
    "in the ideal @xmath7-resolution limit , as demonstrates our simulation in fig.3 , the pe peak well becomes singular towards @xmath74 .",
    "an experimental example of such an effect of the @xmath7-broadening on the linewidths can be seen , for example , in the pe peak from the @xmath93-band of cu whose linewidth increases upon approaching @xmath74 @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the same effect can explain an unusual linewidth energy dependence near @xmath74 observed in bi@xmath100sr@xmath100cacu@xmath100o@xmath109 , which otherwise would indicate deviations from the fermi liquid picture",
    ".    significant pe intensity next to @xmath74 , seen in all regimes of the simulation in fig.3 , also originates from existence of a 3d band crossing @xmath104 and the @xmath8-broadening .",
    "such a peculiarity is typical of the pe experiments on 3d materials such as cu .",
    "intrinsic shifts in the 3d bands can also appear due to a _ matrix element _ mechanism : if @xmath110 as a function of energy and @xmath111 undergoes sharp variations within the @xmath8-broadening , a contribution of the states above and below @xmath57 is different ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "the peak becomes asymmetric and it maximum experiences an intrinsic shift from the true band energy .",
    "such a mechanism has been identified , for example , in tis@xmath100 @xcite .",
    "similar effects due to @xmath112 should be less pronounced , because the energy variations of @xmath113 are normally smooth and become sharper only at extremely low @xmath11 , as can be seen in vleed data ( see , e.g. , @xcite )    the above mechanisms were all based on the bulk bandstructure picture , in which the bandstructure near the surface is considered identical to the bulk one .",
    "this implies that the crystal potential , and thus the wavefunctions , ideally repeat the bulk ones up to the surface .",
    "in fact , within a few atomic layers of the pe  escape depth they can experience notable modification .",
    "such _ surface effects _ also give rise to intrinsic shifts .",
    "for example , the 1dos singularities in the band extrema , characteristic of the bulk @xmath114 , are smeared in the local dos  near the surface ( see , e.g. , pehlke87,fang97,courths01 ) , which results in an increase of the in - band shifting .",
    "the surface effects are harder to control compared to the @xmath43-resolution effects .",
    "qualitatively , their contribution reduces with increase of @xmath22 simultaneously with reduction of the intrinsic shifts of the bulk origin due to the concomitant improvement of the @xmath8-resolution .    _ surface photoelectric effect _ ,",
    "generated by abrupt change in the dielectric response at the surface barrier and described by the @xmath115 part of @xmath110 , can influence the pe signal from the 3d bands through interference of the surface and bulk pe components ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "normally this effect only causes some asymmetry of the pe peaks .",
    "however , near the surface and bulk plasmon excitation energies , especially for free - electron metals such as na , the lineshape changes can be drastic and return large intrinsic shifts @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was demonstrated that the surface and bulk components can be experimentally separated by changing the light incidence angle .",
    "the intrinsic effects are naturally embodied in the one - step pe theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) which finds the pe intensity as a matrix element @xmath116 between the final- and initial - state wavefunctions @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "interference between different bloch wave constituents in the final and initial states , matrix element effects and surface effects , all ignored in the simplified formalism ( [ intf ] ) used above , are naturally included here .",
    "however , a heavy computational machinery often obscures the physical mechanisms .",
    "an example of the intrinsic accuracy analysis using the one - step pe theory can be found in @xcite in application to tise@xmath100 .",
    "similarly to the above results for vse@xmath100 , for the final states above @xmath119 the @xmath8-resolution was found to degrade , causing strong broadening and intrinsic shifts of the pe peaks .",
    "surface effects due to smearing of the bulk 1dos singularities have also been identified .",
    "another example is a calculation on na @xcite , which described the ghost peaks at @xmath120 and in - band shifting in the bottom of the valence band .",
    "3d band mapping remains relevant if the intrinsic shifts are small . of the factors affecting these shifts , the non - linearity of the @xmath52-dispersion , initial - state @xmath3-broadening and ,",
    "partly , variations of @xmath110 are all due to inherent properties of the valence bands under study and remain beyond control by the experimentator .",
    "the @xmath7-resolution , on the contrary , is an exclusively final - state property , and by tuning @xmath11 can taken to values which ensure negligible intrinsic shifts .",
    "this is achieved in the bs - regime @xmath121 ( see [ regimes ] ) .",
    "the exact energy ranges of this regime are however much material dependent .",
    "knowledge of the @xmath8-resolution energy dependence is therefore required .",
    "vleed , covering the energy range below @xmath3140 ev , has recently been established as the experimental method giving the most direct access to the pe final states with resolution in the 3d wavevector ( see exi , tmdcs , cfs and references therein ) . in the vleed spectra of elastic electron reflection ,",
    "the energies of the spectral structures give the critical points in the final bands .",
    "@xmath9 , obtained from this experimental data , can further be used to control @xmath7 in the pe experiment .",
    "broadening of the vleed structures , moreover , gives an estimate of the corresponding @xmath16 values @xcite . by performing calculations of the complex bandstructure with the experimental @xmath122 @xcite ,",
    "one obtains the @xmath8-resolution as @xmath28 of the generated bloch waves ( and simultaneously the energy dependence of @xmath22 , as it was recently demonstrated for graphite in comparison with determination of @xmath22 by the conventional overlayer method @xcite ) . as such calculations",
    "can however be time - consuming , @xmath78 can be estimated in a simplified manner directly from the @xmath16 values and the final - state group velocity @xmath123 as pendry69,knapp79,smith93@xmath124this estimate is accurate however only outside the final - state band gaps . nevertheless , increase of@xmath125 associated with additional damping in the gaps ( see fig.5 ) is normally less significant , except for a few materials with exceptionally wide band gaps such as graphite .",
    "use of the vleed predictions on the @xmath8-resolution allows the experimentator to _ optimize _ the pe experiment on the intrinsic accuracy by selecting the @xmath11 intervals which ensure the bs - regime ( see the examples in [ non - linearity ] ) .    as a concluding remark",
    ", it should be noted that one can significantly improve accuracy of 3d band mapping by computational modelling of the intrinsic accuracy effects , as described above , and correcting the experimental data correspondingly .",
    "this is often critical for proper evaluation of the true excited - state self - energy effects , for example in graphite @xcite and na @xcite .",
    "fundamental principles of pe have been analysed , focussing on emission from 3d  states in the valence band .",
    "damping of the final state due to inelastic and elastic scattering in the crystal results in equivalent broadening in @xmath52 , which acts as the intrinsic @xmath8-resolution of the pe experiment .",
    "the pe peak is then formed as a matrix - element weighted average of the quasiparticle @xmath8-dispersion in valence band , which can be shifted from the dispersion itself .",
    "such shifts intrinsically limit the accuracy of 3d band mapping , which remains accurate only in the bandstructure regime , characterized by the intrinsic @xmath8-broadening small compared to the bz extension in @xmath8 . upon degradation of the @xmath52-resolution the pe experiment yields increasing intrinsic shifts and , finally , enters into the 1dos regime .",
    "the intrinsic @xmath8-resolution can be controlled using vleed , which gives the final - state dispersions and lifetimes .",
    "the mechanisms forming the intrinsic shifts have been exposed , including non - linearity of the @xmath8-dispersion , variations of the matrix element and surface effects .",
    "appearance of the intrinsic shifts and transformation of the regimes of the pe experiment has been analysed using a physically transparent picture of interplay of the final- and initial - state spectral functions , and illustrated by pe simulations and experimental examples .",
    "the @xmath7-broadening gives rise to other surprising effects typical of 3d valence states such as ghost peaks whose direct - transition @xmath7 falls outside the fermi surface , and finite width of the pe peaks at the fermi level .",
