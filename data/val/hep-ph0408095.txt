    "over the past decade , the virtual compton scattering ( vcs ) process on the nucleon , accessed through the @xmath1 reaction , has become a powerful new tool to study the internal structure of the nucleon both at low and high energies ( see @xcite for a review ) . at low virtuality and energy ,",
    "the outgoing real photon plays the role of an applied quasi - static electromagnetic field , and the vcs process measures the response of the nucleon to this applied field , which can be parametrized in nucleon structure quantities , termed generalized polarizabilities ( gps ) @xcite . in this case , the virtuality of the initial photon can be dialed so as to map out the spatial distribution of the electric polarization , the magnetization , or the spin densities of the nucleon  @xcite . because the chiral dynamics plays a dominant role in this regime , at low virtuality , heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt ) provides a natural way to study the gps of the nucleon .",

    "a noteworthy feature of our results is that we provide analytical expressions for all spin - flip gps at next order , analogously as has been done at lowest order in ref .",

    "our prediction for the gp @xmath66 is formally a n@xmath80lo result , and could only be obtained from a hbchpt calculation at @xmath199 , if one were not to use the crossing relations .",
    "our predictions show sizeable corrections to the leading order ( non - zero ) results for the spin - flip gps .",
    "the sign of these corrections is such as to move the leading order results in the direction of a phenomenological estimate of gps based on dispersion relations .",
    "as the spin - flip gps allow for absolute predictions at two successive orders in hbchpt without new low - energy constants entering , they may also be useful as a testing ground of chiral theories",
    ". it would therefore be desirable to have direct experimental information on the spin - flip gps to test the different predictions .",
    "one combination of the four spin - flip gps can be extracted by doing an unpolarized vcs experiment at a fixed value of @xmath4 and by varying the beam energy .",
    "one can extract the other three spin - flip gps through vcs double polarization observables with polarized lepton beam and polarized recoil nucleon .",
    "we gave predictions of these double polarization asymmetries for experimental conditions accessible at mami .",
    "we found that the relative effect on these asymmetries due to the spin - flip gps is of the order of 5 % .",
