    "the simultaneous control of the spin and charge dynamics in low - dimensional semiconductors by electrical means has been one of the major goals of the semiconductor spintronics field for over a decade.@xcite a strong focus within this field has been systems with spin - orbit ( so ) coupling , which connects both the spin and charge degrees of freedom . in strongly asymmetric heterostructures grown along the [ 001 ] direction ,",
    "the dominant so coupling is of the rashba type due to the inversion asymmetry of the confining potential , @xcite and has the form @xmath0 , acting as a momentum dependent zeeman field that aligns the spins of electrons perpendicular to their in - plane momentum . here , @xmath1 are the pauli matrices , and @xmath2 is the in - plane momentum .",
    "the controlled precession of injected spin polarized carriers around this effective zeeman field produced by the rashba coupling in momentum space is the basis for the seminal proposal of datta and das of a ballistic spin - field - effect transistor ( dd - sfet ) @xcite .",
    "however , a decade long quest to realize such a device has yielded disappointing results.@xcite in part , this is due to the fact that the so coupling , which crucially influences spin transport , also determines the spin relaxation rate in weakly disordered systems through random precession due to elastic scattering processes , the so called dyakonov - perel ( dp ) mechanism,@xcite hence limiting the validity of the two - dimensional dd - sfet to the ballistic regime .",
    "schliemann _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have recently suggested a way to design a sfet in ( 001)-plane based structures that should work on the diffusive regime , hence without the need to reach this ellusive ballistic regime , by using the interplay between the rashba and the dresselhaus so coupling , @xmath3 , which originates from the lack of inversion symmetry in the unit cell of the host material.@xcite the key aspect of this proposed device is that the momentum dependence of the direction of the effective zeeman field is removed if the rashba and dresselhaus coupling strengths are equal with @xmath4 . in this case",
    "the in - plane so field is parallel either to the [ 110 ] or [ 1@xmath50 ] direction and does not depend on the direction of the electron momentum .",
    "it was suggested recently in refs .",
    "[ ] that the freezing of one of the electron momentum components in one - dimensional channels suppresses the dp mechanism of spin relaxation and leads to a much longer spin lifetime than in the 2d quantum wells .",
    "this idea , is , however , different from the proposal of ref .",
    "[ ] , where the dp mechanism becomes much less efficient through the combined effects of the rashba and dresselhaus terms ( see also in ref . [ ] ) .    by decoupling the momentum and the spin - quantization axis orientation , the dp mechanism is greatly reduced , and hence the spin coherence time increased making such a device apparently realizable in both the diffusive and ballistic regimes .",
    "the condition @xmath6 is indeed a possible one since it has been recently demonstrated that by applying external bias across the quantum well , one can change the magnitude of @xmath7 in ingaas / inalas - based @xcite and gaas / alas - based @xcite , structures and reach ratios of @xmath8 close to one .",
    "another example of the decoupled so field and momentum directions is provided by ( 011 ) zincblende quantum wells ( qw ) , where the dresselhaus so coupling leads to the effective field perpendicular to the well plane at arbitrary electron momentum , as discussed later .    here",
    "we consider an aspect of the practical realization of this device which will have important limiting consequences in its operating properties .",
    "we show that the randomness of so coupling arising in doped systems destroys the regular precession of electron spins and leads to a spin relaxation both in the sfet device and the ( 011 ) quantum wells even in the ballistic regime .",
    "we show that the size of the devices based on the idea of this effective so decoupling is limited even in the best possible realizations of the devices and , therefore , the spins can not be coherently transferred at arbitrary distances . in most of the low - dimensional qw - based semiconducting systems , the so coupling and finite concentration of electrons",
    "are achieved either by one - side or asymmetric two - side remote doping at distances between the symmetry plane of the qw and the dopant layer of the order of 10 nm.@xcite the spatial non - uniform distribution of dopant ions leads to fluctuations of the so coupling , and therefore , the condition of @xmath6 in a sfet can only be achieved on the average throughout the sample ; the fluctuations of this coupling are analogous to the classical  shot  noise in the transport properties .",
    "the effect is , in some aspects , similar to that investigated by melnikov and rashba in doped bulk si and ge.@xcite at the same time , recent theoretical analysis @xcite shows that in the case of strong so coupling ( large @xmath7 ) achieved in highly asymmetric heterosructures the condition @xmath6 is hardly achievable by applying a bias , and therefore , we are left with the quantum wells where the moderate rashba coupling arises due to the doping or weak structural asymmetry . for a comparison to possible experimental realizations , we shall consider ingaas structures , where the rashba coupling can be reliably influenced in a wide range by the applied bias , as has been proven in refs.@xcite .",
    "we organize the rest of the article as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the properties of the so coupling considered . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the spin relaxation in the proposed field - effect ( fet ) with balanced rashba and dresselhaus so coupling terms and in sec .",
    "iv , the one for the ( 011 ) quantum well . in sec .",
    "v , we present conclusions for these results .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional ( 2d ) channel and a very thin dopant layer ( @xmath9-doping ) separated by a distance @xmath10 with a two - dimensional concentration @xmath11 of dopants at points @xmath12 with charge @xmath13 and @xmath14 being the 2d in - plane vector .    since we are interested in quantum wells , where the rashba so coupling arises due to an asymmetric doping , we assume that the effect of the electric field of dopants on the so strength is linear in the @xmath15component of the field @xmath16 , that is @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath18 is a point at the plane of a sufficiently narrow 2d channel and @xmath19 is a phenomenological system - dependent parameter @xcite .",
    "this relationship takes into account the linear in @xmath20 polarization of the electron wavefunction as well , as found in ref .",
    "[ ] . in more asymmetric heterostructures or asymmetrically grown quantum wells , the structural asymmetry will lead to a regular coordinate - independent shift @xmath21 to the rashba term , which has no influence on the effects of the randomness .",
    "the @xmath22-component of the coulomb field due to the dopant ions is given by @xmath23^{3/2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the dielectric constant , and the summation is performed over the dopant layer .",
    "fig 1 . presents the pattern of @xmath25 at the spatial scale of 200 nm for @xmath26 nm obtained by a monte - carlo produced ",
    "white - noise  distribution of the dopant ions @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations of @xmath27 correlated on the spatial scale of the order of @xmath10 become smaller and smoother with the increase of the distance to the dopant layer , as is shown by one - dimensional cuts in fig.2 .",
    "the rashba parameter is a sum of the mean value produced by the asymmetric field @xmath28 and a random contribution with zero mean : @xmath29 with @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the mean value of the 2d dopant concentration . for the @xmath32doping in quantum wells with @xmath33 the relative amplitude of the fluctuations @xmath34 .",
    "@xcite in contrast to the regular term , which demonstrates a dependence @xmath35 on the applied bias @xmath36 across the well , this random contribution remains relatively weakly influenced and , therefore , can not be removed .",
    "the randomness in the direction of the spin precession axis can be removed when at some applied bias @xmath36 , the condition @xmath37 is satisfied and @xmath35 is spatially uniform .",
    "therefore , the direction of the linear in the in - plane momentum zeeman field does not depend on the momentum directions , and the spin precession becomes more regular . here",
    "a new integral of motion @xmath38 appears and supports the regularity of spin dynamics .",
    "@xcite we emphasize here that the exact matching is possible only at the limit of zero electron momentum , where both the rashba and dresselhaus hamiltonians are linear in @xmath39 . at finite momenta",
    "the dresselhaus hamiltonian must be supplemented by the bulk @xmath40-like term , which in the ( 001 ) quantum well has the form : @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the dresselhaus constant for the bulk , and @xmath43 is the wavevector .",
    "the role of this term depends considerably on the quantum well width .",
    "this effect , as well as the possible but not yet well known momentum dependence of the rashba parameter , can hamper the ability of design the sfet even if the linear contributions are balanced .",
    "the total hamiltonian describing the system written in the hermitian form :    @xmath44 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "{ h}_{d } & = & \\alpha _",
    "{ d}({\\sigma}_{y}{k}_{y}-{\\sigma}_{x}{k}_{x})+{\\alpha _ { c}}{k}_{y}k_{x}({\\sigma}_{x}k_{y}-{\\sigma}_{y}k_{x } ) ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath45 stands for an anticommutator .",
    "the dresselhaus coupling constant @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the expectation value of the @xmath48 operator in the ground state , and @xmath49 ev@xmath50 in gaas and inas - based structures @xcite . in the case of the rigid walls of the qw with the width @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "both the cubic terms in the hamiltonian and the randomness of so coupling lead to the spin relaxation in the sfet device .",
    "our main interest in this paper is the role of the randomness .",
    "however , to find the regime where the effect of the randomness dominates , we will first discuss the contribution of the @xmath53 term for the spin relaxation in the quantum well in the case @xmath54 we will use the approach developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where spin relaxation is described by : @xmath55 with @xmath56 being the anisotropic spin relaxation tensor . for the relaxation of @xmath57 (",
    "expected to be conserved in the @xmath58 case ) we obtain :    @xmath59    where the contribution of the @xmath60originated terms yields @xmath61 with @xmath62 being the momentum relaxation time . we will demonstrate that under realistic conditions , this term is much smaller than the contribution of randomness of the so coupling , which we consider next .",
    "the randomness of the so coupling discussed here makes the precession irregular and , therefore , pushes the range of parameters in which such a sfet can be realized toward the ballistic regime .",
    "we consider a sfet configuration where electrons are injected through perfect nanoscale quantum point contacts @xcite located at points @xmath63 , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 numerates the contacts and the electrons and then move along the @xmath66 axis as shown in fig.1 interacting with the random so field .",
    "the initial spin state of all electrons is @xmath67 with all the spins initially polarized along the @xmath68 direction .",
    "the shape of the injected electron density along the @xmath69-axis , @xmath70 formed by the quantum contact is conserved during the electron propagation such that the corresponding wavefunction has the form : @xmath71 .",
    "we assume that the @xmath69-axis spatial distribution of the wavefunction is much less than @xmath10 , and , therefore , the spin of the @xmath72th electron interacts with the local rashba field @xmath73 and its spatial derivatives . to estimate the maximum spin - coherence lifetime",
    "we assume that the movement is ballistic , that is the momentum of injected electron is conserved , and , therefore , only the randomness of @xmath74 leads to the spin decoherence , thus , presenting the spin relaxation mechanism in relatively high - mobility structures with the electron free path much larger than 10 nm .",
    "this restriction implies that the electron kinetic energy is much larger than the potential fluctuations and ignores quantum mechanical interference effects which are small in the larger system sizes considered here .",
    "relaxation of this approximation will further decrease the spin - coherence lifetime in the diffusive regime .    under these conditions",
    "the random contribution to the so hamiltonian obtained with eq.(3 ) is : @xmath75    the spin of a moving electron is , therefore , a subject of a randomly time - dependent so field , with each electron probing the realization of the field at the given path or different electrons probing the different configurations of essentially the same random field .",
    "the direction and the magnitude of the zeeman field randomly change in time , and therefore , a dephasing of the spin states occurs .",
    "the correlation function of the random field is characterized by the fourier component @xmath76 extended in the range of frequencies @xmath77 up to @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the time the electron takes to travel a distance @xmath10 through which the rashba coupling changes appreciably , and @xmath80 is the electron velocity .",
    "the frequency @xmath81 is much larger than the spin - flip frequency @xmath82 with @xmath83 being of the order of 0.1 .",
    "this condition implies that the random contribution to the zeeman field is out of resonance with the spin - flip transitions , and , for this reason , the spin - flip transition rate is low .",
    "therefore , under these conditions it is necessary to pass through many domains of the so coupling for @xmath57 to be destroyed .",
    "analysis similar to that done in refs .",
    "[ ] shows that in the case @xmath84 the random so coupling mechanism leads to the spin relaxation rate of the order of @xmath85 . in the system considered here , with @xmath86 it scales with the system parameters as @xmath87",
    "this trend is seen in fig.3 which presents the results of the monte carlo simulation of the spin dynamics .",
    "as one can see in fig .",
    "3 , @xmath88 is gradually destroyed at the electron path @xmath89 of the order of 50 @xmath90 m , that is about @xmath91 domains of the so random coupling .",
    "we associate this decay time with the spin - coherence lifetime in the system .",
    "the role of the randomness is demonstrated by the fact that the spin - coherence lifetime depends very strongly on the distance between the dopant layer and the conducting electrons increasing with the distance @xmath10 . even when the mean so coupling is the same , the increase in the distance between the dopant layer and the symmetry plane of the quantum well decreases the randomness and , in turn , the spin relaxation rate , as can be seen from a comparison of the @xmath92 dependences in fig.3 .",
    "the noise in the @xmath92-dependence corresponds to the simulation with a finite number of electrons and must be experimentally observable in the sfets operating in this mode . for these reasons , the size of the transistor base can not be very long , and the spins can not be controllably delivered at distances much larger than 100 @xmath93 m at best .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate of the ratio of the relaxation rates due to these two mechanisms , namely , the so coupling randomness @xmath94 and the @xmath60terms contributions @xmath95 gives : @xmath96 the small ratio @xmath97 which strongly depends on the mobility , is typically of the order of @xmath98 and , therefore , favors the role of the @xmath40 dresselhaus contribution .",
    "however , at @xmath99 it is compensated by the @xmath100 prefactor arising due to the size quantization and by the effect that due to the fast in - plane angular dependence of the @xmath60originated terms , the efficiency of this mechanism is decreased , leading to a large prefactor @xmath101 in eq.[eq::gammaratio ] .",
    "the exact value of this prefactor is model - dependent , being , however , of the order of ten at any reasonable model .",
    "therefore , even at relatively small fluctuations of the rashba so coupling @xmath102 , they will dominate as the spin relaxation mechanism .",
    "we mention here that despite the spin - orbit coupling in our model depending linearly on the momentum , in the quasiballistic regime the spin relaxation path @xmath103 where @xmath104 is electron effective mass , shows only a weak electron - momentum dependence .",
    "the reason is that the random contribution to the spin precession angle for passing through one domain , being of the order of @xmath105 , is momentum - independent , and , therefore , the number of the domains contributing into @xmath89 , depends weakly on @xmath106 at the same time , for the dresselhaus @xmath60contribution one would expect @xmath107",
    "another interesting system where the direction of the so field is momentum - independent is the ( 011 ) zincblende quantum well . here",
    "so coupling is described by the dresselhaus hamiltonian @xmath108 , \\ ] ] with the direction of the so field being always parallel to the @xmath22-axis which is perpendicular to the qw plane . here",
    "@xmath109 the @xmath110 term in the square brackets is the bulk - originated dresselhaus term , which , contrary to the ( 001 ) quantum well , due to the symmetry , does not lead to the change in the so field direction with the changes in the momentum . when the system is the subject of the regular rashba hamiltonian @xmath111 also , the electron spin precesses around the axis determined by the direction of the @xmath112 @xmath113 field with the rate @xmath114 where @xmath115 for the component of the spin initially polarized along the @xmath15axis , one obtains    @xmath116    where @xmath117 is the precession amplitude . randomness in @xmath113 causes fluctuations in the magnitude and direction of the zeeman so field acting on the electron spin , both now changing randomly in time .",
    "eventually , this leads to the spin relaxation , which can be also understood as the @xmath118 to @xmath119 spin - flip transitions caused by the random field .",
    "we consider the case of the asymmetrically doped quantum well for which the mean value of the rashba parameter can be influenced by applied bias . a typical evolution of @xmath120 averaged over an ensemble of electrons for the parameters of spin - orbit coupling typical for in@xmath121ga@xmath121as quantum wells is presented in fig .",
    "4 . we consider two cases : a partially and the fully compensated rashba terms . in the former case",
    "the relaxation occurs as both the amplitude of the oscillations and the mean value averaged over the ensemble of electrons tend to zero .",
    "as one can see in the fig .",
    "4 , the decay time of @xmath122 in the in@xmath121ga@xmath121as structures is of the order of 10 ps , similar to the case of the @xmath123 transistor .    in  pure  gaas structures , where @xmath19 is an order of magnitude smaller than in the in@xmath121ga@xmath121as alloys",
    ", one would expect the spin relaxation time due to the randomness of the doping which roughly scales as @xmath124 two orders of magnitude longer , that is of the order of 10@xmath50 ps .",
    "a long electron spin coherence time @xmath125 of this order of magnitude has indeed been observed experimentally in refs .",
    "[ ] for the ( 011 ) symmetrically doped gaas qws of relatively low mobility with @xmath126 @xmath127/(vs ) .",
    "it is instructive to estimate the corresponding distance @xmath89 at which the spins of diffusively propagating electrons can be delivered for this time in these low - mobility samples . with this mobility",
    ", the momentum relaxation time @xmath128 ps leads to @xmath129 , where @xmath130 cm / s is the speed of optically injected electrons investigated in ref . [ ] . here",
    "@xmath131 ps , and therefore , @xmath89 is of the order of a few @xmath132 .",
    "therefore , due to the low mobility these qws can not be used for the simultaneous long - distance charge and spin transfer necessary for the spintronics applications despite a long spin coherence time there .",
    "we have investigated the spin relaxation rate arising due to a random so coupling in a possible realizations of a sfet with the balanced rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling and the ( 011 ) zincblende quantum well .",
    "these systems , where the direction of the effective spin - orbit zeeman field is expected to be independent on the electron momentum and , therefore , the dyakonov - perel mechanism of spin relaxation must be suppressed , are considered as promising elements for the spintronics applications . at the same time , due to the randomness of the rashba contribution to the spin - orbit coupling , causing an additional spin relaxation , in both cases the relaxation time can not exceed considerably 10 ps thus limiting the size of the base of this transistor of the order of 10 @xmath93 m , which weakly depends on the electron momentum , and , therefore , restricts the possibility of their experimental realization .",
    "recent focus in spintronics is related to si / ge two - dimensional structures , where the spin - orbit coupling is weak @xcite . within these systems",
    "the randomness of the so coupling , which is related either to the randomness in the dopant distribution as considered here or to random bonds on the si / ge interfaces @xcite will cause spin relaxation and limit their potential applications as well .",
