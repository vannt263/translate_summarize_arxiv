    "their size ranges from the nanometer - scale ( for example for two - component complexes like barnase and barstar @xcite ) through tens of nanometers ( for example for viruses , which typically consist of small multiples of 60 components @xcite ) up to the micrometer scale ( for example the mitotic spindle @xcite ) . even in steady state",
    "most biological complexes remain highly dynamic , with association events being balanced by dissociation events .",
    "prominent examples are nuclear pore complexes @xcite or focal adhesions@xcite .",
    "another important example for the dynamic nature of biological complexes are actin filaments @xcite , which are called _ living polymers _ due to their continuous exchange dynamics .",
    "@xcite similar to the broad range of length scales , association rate constants observed in biological systems span a wide spectrum ranging from @xmath0 up to @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite the highly dynamic nature of biological assemblies as well as the large range of involved spatial and temporal scales renders this physical problem challenging but fascinating .",
    "interestingly , recent advances in the fabrication of functionalized colloids with directional interactions ( _ patchy particles _ ) make it possible to design elementary building blocks of micrometer sizes which can be used to self - assemble complexes with new functionality .",
    "experimental techniques ranging from dna - mediated self - assembly @xcite to entropic depletion interactions @xcite have been rapidly advancing during the last decade , thus providing a plethora of possibilities to fabricate colloidal particles whose shape and interactions can be controlled in detail . moreover external stimuli such as temperature , light or ph can be used to control the inter - particle interactions during the assembly process .",
    "@xcite these techniques allow for a state- or time - dependent switching of the interactions and can be used to steer the assembly process . controlling",
    "the particle interactions during the assembly process can prevent kinetic trapping resulting in a higher yield of the desired structure , as has recently been shown in a computational study for virus assembly .",
    "@xcite to fully exploit the potential of these techniques , a detailed understanding of the dynamics of the assembly process ( distribution of intermediates , relevant time scales ) is of crucial importance .    understanding the mechanisms governing chemical reactions has a long tradition in theoretical physics and chemistry .",
    "the most powerful analytical technique in this context is the fokker - planck or smoluchowski equation , which has been used early to study bimolecular association based on diffusive motion .",
    "this approach was pioneered by smoluchowski who first calculated the maximum diffusion - limited reaction rate for a fully reactive spherical particle .",

    "@xcite however , most of these generalizations focus on the calculation of association rates and only a few aim at describing reversible reactions .",
    "@xcite    to study the full dynamics of protein assembly one needs to consider both association and dissociation processes . moreover , even for globular proteins the intermediates formed during the assembly process are often of highly non - spherical geometry , thus rendering an analytical treatment of assembly in the framework of the fokker - planck equation very difficult . in this case",

    "proteins are described as assemblies of spheres equipped with reactive patches .",
    "their motion in real and orientation space is based on the overdamped langevin equation with an anisotropic diffusion tensor .",

    ", two particles can stochastically react with a microscopic reaction rate and thus form a bond .",
    "similarly an existing bond can be disrupted with a microscopic dissociation rate .",
    "we first show how these microscopic reaction rates can be related to macroscopic , experimentally measurable rates .",
    "we then verify that our algorithm correctly reproduces the macroscopically expected equilibrium behavior for bimolecular reactions .",
    "finally we investigate the assembly of a pentameric ring structure and compare our simulation results to a macroscopic rate equation approach . here",

    "finally the clusters are shifted so that the desired relative distance between the proteins is achieved .",
    ", width=321 ]      our simulation approach is based on the concept of the encounter complex .",
    "@xcite in this concept a bimolecular reaction is decomposed into two steps : the undirected diffusive motion of the two binding partners @xmath11 and @xmath12 until they stochastically reach the encounter state @xmath13 and the reaction from the encounter state to the bound complex @xmath14 . in terms of the free energy landscape the encounter complex represents a barrier separating the flat diffusive energy landscape from the reaction funnel .",
    "thus , it is a transient state which can be characterized by the onset of highly correlated motion between the binding partners .",
    "@xcite a barrier in the free energy landscape might arise for example due to a necessary rearrangement of the binding site or due to a reorganization of the water layer . in some cases there",
    "might not exist an explicit barrier , but even then the encounter complex is a helpful theoretical concept .",
    "considering the encounter complex as the `` watershed '' between diffusion and reaction processes , the bimolecular reaction can be split according to the following reaction scheme : @xmath15 here @xmath16 and @xmath17 represent the overall kinetic rates of the reaction . in eq .",
    "encounter ] the binding and unbinding process is split into a diffusive part represented by the rates @xmath18 and @xmath19 and a reaction part represented by @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively . separating the binding process in free diffusive motion without steering forces and",
    "localized binding requires short - ranged interactions .",
    "thus , our approach for the simulation of protein association corresponds to a regime of high salt concentration screening long - ranged electrostatic forces .",
    "indeed this is a reasonable assumption for physiological salt conditions .",
    "moreover , our approach can be used to study the assembly of @xmath22m - sized colloids functionalized with reactive patches where the size of the reactive region is small compared to the particle size .",
    "as we consider a situation in which the interaction between the proteins is short - ranged and only affects the reaction probabilities in the encounter state , individual clusters undergo free diffusive motion without an additional drift term .",
    "moreover , here we do not consider hydrodynamic interactions which also might influence the binding kinetics .",
    "our simulation system can be decomposed into four elementary structures : proteins , patches , bonds , clusters .",
    "clusters are rigid objects that can consist of a single or of multiple proteins held together by bonds .",
    "two clusters can react with each other by bond formation between adhesive patches .",
    "a cluster consisting of multiple proteins can decay into smaller clusters by bond dissociation .",
    "proteins are described by sets of non - overlapping , hard spheres approximating their shape .",
    "the proteins are equipped with reactive patches which reflect the localized binding sites .",
    "a patch is defined starting from a sphere of radius @xmath2 whose center @xmath23 ( relative to the protein ) can be chosen independent of the center of the protein .",
    "in addition , each patch is described by an orientation vector @xmath5 . as a simple example for a non - globular protein , in fig .",
    "1a we schematically show a dumbbell - shaped protein consisting of two hard spheres in contact .",
    "the protein is equipped with one reactive patch of radius @xmath2 whose center coincides with the center of one of the steric spheres and is thus shifted by @xmath3 from the protein center located at the contact point of the steric spheres .",
    "the orientation vector @xmath5 points along the long axis of the dumbbell . using the above definitions we formulate the following set of equations to define the encounter between two clusters mediated by a pair of patches , compare fig .",
    "1b : @xmath24 eq .",
    "encounter1 ] means that the distance @xmath25 between the centers of the two patches has to be sufficiently small for an encounter to occur and can be implemented easily in a simulation .",
    "[ eq . encounter2 ] is more complex .",
    "it involves the center - to - center vector @xmath6 and not only reflects that the patches are anisotropic , but also assumes that an encounter only occurs if the two partners have a favorable orientation relatively to each other which is defined by the two parameters @xmath26 and @xmath26 . in general",
    "an anisotropic protein can be described by multiple spheres and the center of the patches can be chosen independent of the steric spheres , allowing for a variable description of proteins and their localized interactions .",
    "rejection methods .",
    "the distance distribution of two hard spheres of radius @xmath27 nm in a periodic box of volume @xmath28 is shown for two different rejection methods . in the first rejection method ( green )",
    "new positions of the particles are chosen ( starting from their positions before collision ) until no overlap is observed . in the second rejection method ( red )",
    "the spheres are set back to their position before the collision .",
    "the simulations were performed at a time - step resolution of @xmath29ns . , width=321 ]    in our approach particle motion is described by the six - dimensional , overdamped langevin equation ( brownian motion ) describing translational and rotational diffusion of an arbitrarily shaped but rigid object @xcite : @xmath30 here @xmath31 is a six - dimensional position vector describing the position and orientations at time t and @xmath32 is gaussian white noise .",
    "@xmath33 is the mobility matrix which is calculated on - the - fly for any cluster shape @xcite following the method of de la torre @xcite . because intermediates continuously grow and shrink due to association and dissociation , the diffusive properties of the involved clusters are continuously changing during a simulation .",
    "protein particles are modeled as hard spheres and their collision requires special attention . in a bd framework ,",
    "particle velocities are not defined and thus a ballistic reflection scheme is not appropriate .",
    "here we treat steric collisions by a rejection method similar to mc simulations .",
    "if a steric overlap between two clusters is created during a move step , this move step is rejected .",
    "one method to deal with this situation would be to repeatedly choose a new position of the two clusters , starting from their original location and orientation , until the move step is accepted .",
    "this method leads to incorrect simulation results as is demonstrated for the example of two hard spheres in a periodic box in fig .  2 . here",
    "a histogram of the distance distribution between the two spheres , scaled by the volume of a spherical shell , is shown in a range in which boundary effects are not observed . by choosing a new position until successful acceptance of the move step ( green histogram ) ,",
    "an effective repulsion between the two spheres is introduced , leading to a depletion zone at small particle distances instead of the expected uniform distribution . if , instead of choosing a new position , we set the two clusters involved in a steric collision back to their original position ( and orientation ) before the move step , we recover the expected uniform equilibrium distribution ( shown in red in fig .  2 ) .",
    "thus , this method ensures that the correct equilibrium distribution is realized .      in our approach , clusters are rigid assemblies consisting of one or multiple proteins . assuming that the assembly geometry is determined by unique local interactions , a set of local rules is necessary to describe the new relative orientation and position of two reacting clusters.@xcite these local rules are encoded in the bond that is formed between the clusters .",
    "each bond carries the information of the desired center - to - center ( ctc ) vector of the two proteins directly involved in the binding process as well as their relative orientation ( torsion vectors ) . upon reaction",
    "the two clusters instantaneously flip into the desired relative configuration .",
    "this rule follows from the assumption that the short - ranged forces involved in the final binding step lead to a fast rearrangement on the time scale of our bd simulation .",
    "the reorientation process is schematically shown in fig .",
    "in a first step the clusters are shifted and rotated so that the predefined ctc - vector matches the real ctc - vector .",
    "this procedure enforces the correct position of the two merging clusters relative to each other . in a next step the relative orientation of the clusters",
    "is corrected by aligning the projection of the two torsion vectors on a plane perpendicular to the ctc - vector . the necessary rotation and translation of the clusters",
    "is distributed between them according to their diffusive weights .",
    "this means that for a small and a large partner , essentially only the small partner is moved , as one expects for physical reasons ; for two similarly sized partners , both are moved to a similar extent .",
    "since all interactions are local ( e.g. local patches or constraints on orientation / torsion ) , the encounter complex corresponds to a region in configuration space surrounding the desired relative position and orientation .",
    "if this region is sufficiently small , the instantaneous flipping into the `` correct '' configuration is comparable to the resolution of the bd simulation .",
    "reorientation of the clusters during the binding process can lead to a steric overlap either with another cluster or between the merging clusters .",
    "if this is the case , the reaction is rejected and the old positions and orientations of the clusters before the move step are resumed .",
    "the steric collision of two merging clusters reflects that during the assembly process incompatible fragments can prevent the formation of the desired structure .",
    "for example if the desired structure encoded by the local bonds is a ring consisting of five proteins , two ring fragments each containing three proteins can not bind with each other .",

    "if on average the encounter region is well explored before an association , we can approximate the real distribution within @xmath34 by a uniform distribution .",
    "this approximation is equivalent to the underlying assumption in the work of pogson et al @xcite and klann et al .",
    "@xcite who introduced a reactive volume ( and an intrinsic association rate @xcite ) based on the assumption that the particles are randomly distributed in the box at all times .    alsallaq and zhou also used thermodynamic arguments to determine the equilibrium constant for the bound complex .",

    "3a ) , our approach can account for reactions which are reaction- or diffusion - limited , as will be shown below in the results section . to study assembly , this is of great importance as intermediates emerging during the assembly process can have very different diffusion properties and a reaction that was reaction - limited for small clusters can become diffusion - limited for larger clusters .",
    "thus , by identifying the equilibrium constant for the formation of the encounter with the reactive volume @xmath34 ( eq .  [ keq encounter 2 ] ) and relegating bond association and dissociation to the reaction rates , we can identify the reaction rates @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the microscopic framework with the corresponding reaction rates @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the macroscopic framework ( eq .  [ eq keq2 ] ) and the equilibrium constant is given by : @xmath76 in accordance with the work by shoup and szabo @xcite the rate @xmath77 is given by the product of the equilibrium constant for the formation of the encounter complex and the reaction rate for the formation of the final complex .",

    "@xcite ) .    while the reactive volume @xmath78 is sufficient to predict the correct equilibrium constant ( eq .",

[ keq encounter 1 ] ) .    any simulation algorithm with underlying reversible dynamics needs to satisfy detailed balance . to establish detailed balance we follow the approach by morelli and ten wolde @xcite who inferred from a detailed balance consideration that the relative position distribution of two spherical particles prior to a reaction has to be identical ( after renormalization ) to the position distribution of the two particles after dissociation . for two hard spheres covered with a reactive shell",
    ", it has been argued that detailed balance can be introduced by placing the two hard spheres according to a radial uniform distribution within the reactive shell followed by one additional move step @xcite .",
    "here we generalize this idea as follows : upon the dissociation of two clusters , a new configuration is chosen uniformly within the encounter region @xmath34 followed by a diffusive move step of the two clusters . to establish the uniform distribution in @xmath34",
    "we exploit the time invariance symmetry of the diffusion propagator .",
    "this symmetry ensures that in a confined volume of the configuration space a uniform distribution is established as the steady state distribution .",
    "as @xmath34 describes a configuration around the desired relative configuration of the proteins , we can generate a uniform distribution without prior knowledge of the exact shape of the reactive volume by performing various `` pseudo - diffusion '' steps of the two clusters starting from their predefined relative configuration .",

    "thus it is especially suited to study assembly dynamics as parts of the reactive volume might become sterically blocked during the assembly process . these steric effects are automatically taken into account with our method . the effect of steric blocking and its consequences for assembly will be discussed in the results section . moreover",

    "the bond formation in this case is fundamentally different from the above discussed process as no diffusion is involved . since clusters are rigid objects , internal bond formation does not change the shape of the cluster .",
    "thus it can be considered as an internal process stabilizing an already existing structure .",
    "given a dissociation rate of @xmath21 for a specific bond , we can relate the internal association rate to the free energy @xmath85 of bond formation . for a closed loop containing @xmath86 bonds ,",
    "there are @xmath86 different configurations with one open bond in the loop and the fraction of the open and closed loop in equilibrium is given by : @xmath87 thus , the internal association regulates the fraction of open and closed loop configurations . in a more realistic scenario ,",
    "the dissociation of one bond in a loop will enable an enhanced internal movement .",

    "9b than in fig .",
    "this shows that we are indeed in a different assembly regime and the change in concentration is not compensated by the change in @xmath20 in the kinetics of the assembly process . at lower concentration ( fig .",
    "9b ) clusters need a longer time to find each other diffusively which is reflected in the slower approach towards equilibrium .    in fig .",
    "9c and fig .",
    "9d the normalized fragment concentrations with an additional stabilization of the final ring structure @xmath202ns@xmath113 is shown .",
    "as discussed previously , the internal bond formation can be understood as an intrinsic process which stabilizes the full ring ( eq .  [ eq .",
    "rate_eq2 ] ) .",
    "the value chosen for the internal association rate corresponds to a free energy of @xmath203 associated with the bond formation according to eq .",
    ". internal ] . in fig .",
    "9c and fig .  9d",
    ", the normalized fragment concentration of the full ring ( black line ) is shown irrespective of the number of bonds in the ring . comparing the simulation results and the rate equation approach we again observe very good agreement between them . similarly to the case without internal bond formation ( fig .",
    "9a and fig .",
    "9b ) , the assembly dynamics at lower concentration ( fig .",
    "9d ) is slower than at higher concentration ( fig .",
    "9c ) , while the equilibrium steady state remains the same in both cases .",
    "in contrast to the reversible bond formation without additional stabilization of the ring ( fig .",
    "9c and fig .",
    "9e ) the normalized concentration of the full ring is significantly increased by the internal bond formation . due to mass conservation the increase in the concentration of the full ring structure",
    "is balanced by a decrease in the concentration of smaller fragments showing how an additional internal state can alter the equilibrium cluster size distribution .",
    "finally , we investigate the assembly dynamics for irreversible bond formation ( @xmath190 ) for two different microscopic reaction rates @xmath20 corresponding to the regime of reaction - limited reactions ( fig .",
    "9e ) and diffusion - influenced reactions ( fig .",
    "again the simulation results and the rate equation approach agree remarkably well with each other . by comparing fig .",
    "9e and fig .",
    "9f we again verify that the approach towards the steady state is much slower in the case of lower concentration shown in fig .",
    "however , in contrast to the previously discussed reversible bond formation , the steady state is different in both cases with different fraction of ring fragments containing 3,4 and 5 proteins .",
    "this reflects a fundamental difference between the steady state observed for reversible bond formation and the steady state observed for irreversible bond formation . in the case of reversible bond formation the steady state is an equilibrium state in which dissociation and association events balance each other .",
    "this state only depends on the microscopic reaction rates @xmath20 and @xmath18 and the size of the reactive volume @xmath34 ( eq .  [ eq .",
    "ka_prime ] ) .",
    "in contrast the steady state for irreversible bond formation is a trapped steady state without any underlying dynamics . in this case of irreversible bond formation",
    "the ring fragments can not disassemble and fragments of size @xmath204 can not further assemble if all smaller fragments have been used up .",
    "thus , in the case of trapping the final state depends on the kinetics of the assembly .",
    "the difference in the two steady states observed in fig .",
    "9e and fig .",
    "9f also shows that the assembly dynamics in fig .",
    "9f is not only slowed down compared to fig .  9e , but that the different diffusive properties of the cluster fragments lead to a change in the ratio of the concentration of intermediates during the assembly process .",
    "in general , larger fragments are diffusing slower than smaller fragments , and hence the rate for a reaction between two larger fragments is more strongly affected by diffusion than the reaction rate for two smaller fragments . in fig .",
    "9f this results in a lower concentration of pentameric rings , as the reaction probability of two small fragments is less affected by diffusion than the reaction probability of a smaller and a larger fragment .",
    "this leads to a stronger depletion of small fragments and hence a higher concentration of trapped ring fragments with 3 or 4 proteins .",
    "biological structures like the actin cytoskeleton @xcite or the nuclear pore complex @xcite are highly dynamic with their constituents being continuously exchanged . to understand the biological functionality of these fascinating systems , a detailed understanding of the assembly dynamics is crucial .",
    "moreover , advances in the fabrication of colloidal particles with directed interactions ( `` patchy particles '' ) allow to design a plethora of differently shaped building blocks with tunable interactions that can self - assemble into new materials .",
    "@xcite to increase the yield of the desired structures encoded in the local particle interactions , kinetic trapping in unfavorable configurations during the assembly process has to be prevented .",
    "recently it has been shown that particle interactions during the assembly process can be actively controlled .",
    "@xcite thus , by a state- or time - dependent switching of reactivity the assembly process can be actively steered to reduce kinetic trapping .",
    "however , to fully exploit the possibilities of controlling the assembly process , a detailed understanding of its full dynamics with the formation of assembly intermediates is necessary .",
    "here we presented a novel simulation approach which is ideally suited to investigate the dynamics of large protein assemblies with well - defined architectural properties .",
    "proteins are represented by ( multiple ) non - overlapping , hard spheres equipped with reactive patches . in contrast to most previous studies on protein assembly @xcite , which rely on force fields to describe protein interactions , we combine overdamped brownian motion with the concept of reversible , stochastic reactivity for patchy particles .",
    "each cluster is treated as rigid object with its diffusive properties being evaluated on - the - fly .",
    "if the reactive patches of two clusters form an encounter by force - free diffusive motion , a bond between the clusters is established with a predefined rate .",
    "local rules are used to describe the resulting rearrangements , which are assumed to be very fast on the time scale of the bd simulations . for potential - based simulations",
    ", these rearrangements would proceed due to the corresponding forces , which do not exist in our approach .",
    "similar to the association process , the dissociation process also occurs with a predefined rate .",
    "here we have derived the rules for the placement of the two partners which are required to satisfy detailed balance .    together ,",
    "these rules render our approach very efficient because complexes formed during the assembly are diffusing as rigid objects ( thus reducing the number of degrees of freedom to be propagated to six ) and because interactions are treated locally ( as opposed to evaluating potentials ) .",
    "nevertheless , the patchy particle approach includes detailed information on the architecture of protein assemblies , thus allowing us to study the spatial - temporal dynamics of specific biological systems of interest .",
    "moreover , we have been able to show how the microscopic reaction parameters used in our approach correspond to the macroscopic reaction rates commonly used to describe the dynamics of the concentration of assembly intermediates .",
    "this allows a direct comparison between macroscopic , experimentally measurable concentrations and simulation results . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this is the first time that a bd algorithm combining stochastic reactivity of anisotropic patches with reversible dynamics that fulfills detailed balance is presented .",
    "testing our algorithm against mean field prediction for the case of bimolecular reactions revealed the importance of satisfying detailed balance .",
    "as an example for a multi - component cluster , we investigated the assembly of a pentameric ring . here",
    "we compared our simulation results to a rate equation approach for the different fragment concentrations . by extracting the diffusive on- and off - rates from our simulations we find excellent agreement between the rate equation approach and our simulation results even for the case of",
    "strongly diffusion - influenced assembly without any free parameter .",
    "we showed that the assembly dynamics can be significantly changed by the change in the diffusive properties of the assembly intermediates . in the case of irreversible bond formation",
    "the system becomes trapped with incompatible ring fragments . in this case",
    "not only the assembly kinetics but also the finally reached steady state depends on the different diffusive properties of the assembly intermediates . for complex assembly geometries trapping is a common motif .",
    "thus , in this case not only correctly predicted equilibrium structure distribution of the assembly intermediates is relevant but also the correctly predicted kinetics of the assembly process as the system might become trapped before reaching the expected equilibrium steady state . by demonstrating how the macroscopic reaction rates can be calculated from our simulation ,",
    "we have developed a framework in which a qualitative prediction of the changes in the macroscopic reaction rates , based on the changes of the diffusive properties of the assembly intermediates , is possible .",
    "because our approach aims to describe the assembly of large protein structures , the details of individual bond formations are not resolved within this framework . in general , the use of local rules requires well - defined target geometries and the instantaneous local rearrangement accompanying stochastic bond formation follows from the assumption that the time scales of assembly and local rearrangements are well separated .",
    "given the coarse - grained nature of our approach , the instantaneous rearrangement during binding is a valid approximation if the encounter volume specifies a narrow region around the desired configuration . in the case of large encounter volumes",
    "the assumption of fast and small local rearrangements can break down and the use of local rules needs to be considered with care .",
    "in particular in the case of higher protein densities or assembly close to a membrane this can lead to a situation in which physically reasonable rearrangements are suppressed by our steric rules . in classical md or bd simulations with potentials",
    ", these rearrangements would be realized due to ensuing mechanical forces .",
    "typical biological examples for situations which are out of the scope of our current approach are the bending of a membrane by bar - proteins @xcite , the emergence of polymorphic virus structures @xcite or the assembly of actin networks from preexisting large fibers @xcite . in principle , such a situation could be resolved by using hybrid schemes that interface our approach with potential - based simulations for local rearrangements . for the time being , however , we focus on the assembly of protein complexes with well - defined architectures , like native viruses@xcite , centrioles @xcite or actin filaments in networks growing by incorporation of actin monomers from solution @xcite .    in the future , our approach can be used to study the assembly of such complex protein clusters .",
    "after we have successfully verified our approach by comparing averaged simulation data with macroscopic mean field results , we now can investigate the stochastic variance inherent to these self - assembly processes .",
    "our approach is ideally suited to study the effect of time- or state - dependent changes in reactivity , as has been recently shown in a qualitative study on the effect on hierarchical assembly in virus capsids .",
    "@xcite moreover , this approach might also help to design artificial systems that do not get kinetically trapped in undesired structures .",
    "it can also be coupled with hydrodynamic schemes , in particular with reactive multi - particle collision dynamics @xcite .",
