    "there are several physical situations in which it is required that a polymer chain is inextensible .",
    "this happens for instance when the chain is pulled at its ends by strong forces @xcite in experiments of dna micromanipulations . in order to impose the constraints in the stochastic equations governing the motion of the chain it is possible to apply a variety of powerful techniques @xcite .",
    "progresses in the understanding of statistic and dynamical aspects of inextensible chains have been obtained mainly with the help of numerical simulations , see for example refs .",
    "@xcite . for analytical calculations , models in which the condition of inextensibility is relaxed are usually preferred .",
    "this is the case of the gaussian chain @xcite , which often replaces the freely jointed chain @xcite in the study of the statistical behavior of polymers systems .",
    "other examples of theories in which the length of the chain is allowed to become infinitely long are the models of rouse @xcite and zimm @xcite .",
    "they provide a satisfactory description of the dynamics of polymer chains in solutions , but could fail in the case of a chain that is stretched under strong external forces applied at its ends .    for these reasons",
    "it is highly desirable to construct a path integral model describing the dynamics of an inextensible chain which is simple enough to allow analytic calculations . in particular",
    ", we are interested in the derivation of the generating functional of the correlation functions of the relevant variables that describe the conformation of the chain .",
    "the usual starting point is a discrete mechanical model which provides a coarse grained approximation of the chain .",
    "successively , a continuous limit is performed , in which the number of elements becomes infinitely large and their length approaches zero , while the total length of the chain @xmath0 is kept constant .",
    "this limit is useful in order to smooth out the dependence on the details of the particular mechanical model chosen . in the first part of this article",
    "the case of a freely hinged chain ( fhc ) is considered .",
    "this is a system of beads connected together by massless links of fixed length @xmath1 .",
    "the fhc has been studied in the past in refs .",
    "@xcite in connection with the dynamics of cold polymers or a gas of hot polymers . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that the generating functional for a fhc coincides in the continuous limit with the partition function of a theory which closely resembles a nonlinear sigma model .",
    "for this reason it has been called the generalized nonlinear sigma model or simply gnl@xmath2 m . within the gnl@xmath2 m it is possible to perform analytical calculations of physical quantities that can be applied to study the dynamics of cold chains or of chains moving in a very viscous environment @xcite .",
    "one drawback of the gnl@xmath2 m is that it regards the fhc as a gas of fluctuating particles with the inextensibility constraints being implemented by means of a product of delta functions .",
    "the introduction of delta functions to fix constraints is a standard procedure in the investigations of the statistical mechanics of polymers , where it is an useful tool in order to limit the conformations of the chain . in the case of dynamics , however , a physical explanation of the appearance of the delta functions inside the path integral of the gnl@xmath2 m is necessary , otherwise the connection with the stochastic process of the fluctuating chain is lost .",
    "such connection was up to now somewhat obscure , despite the fact that in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been possible to verify that the gnl@xmath2 m reproduces as expected the sum over all chain conformations satisfying a free langevin equation and subjected to constraints that ensure the property of inextensibility .",
    "one goal of this work is to provide a physical interpretation of the gnl@xmath2 m as a stochastic process in which the noise is non - gaussian .",
    "the starting point is the observation that the chain degrees of freedom which are constrained by the inextensibility requirement are frozen and thus can not be influenced by the noise .",
    "this implies that the noise must be constrained too .",
    "the conditions on the noise are imposed in the present approach in a soft way using an elastic potential .",
    "it is the introduction of this potential that modifies the noise distribution and makes it non - gaussian .",
    "the rigid constraints are recovered in the limit in which the elastic constants become infinite . following this strategy ,",
    "the motion of the beads of the chain is described by a system of free langevin equations in which the random forces are characterized by a non - gaussian distribution . for any finite value of the elastic constants ,",
    "the related generating functional corresponds to that of a chain consisting of beads connected together by springs . with increasing values of the elastic constants ,",
    "the springs become stiffer and stiffer until at the end an inextensible chain is obtained .",
    "let us note that also the beads of the rouse model are joined together by springs .",
    "however , in that model the potentials are chosen in such a way that the springs are in their rest positions only when the distances between neighboring beads is zero .",
    "for this reason , in the limit of infinite elastic constants , the chain collapses to a point .",
    "other differences of the gnl@xmath2 m from the rouse model have been discussed in details in ref .",
    "the present strategy to enforce the inextensibility constraints with the help of potentials closely resembles the way in which stiff constraints ( sometimes called flexible constraints ) are imposed @xcite in stochastic equations .",
    "stiff constraints are fixed in fact with the help of potentials @xcite whose role is to create an energy barrier that strongly suppresses those chain conformations that do not satisfy the constraints .",
    "the form of these potentials , like for instance the fene potential , is usually too complicated to allow analytic calculations . in the case of the gnl@xmath2 m , instead , there are only elastic potentials , which are relatively simple .",
    "another striking difference with respect to stiff constraints is that in our approach it is taken the limit in which the strength of the elastic forces become infinite . in this limit",
    "the constraints become rigid and not flexible .    in the second part of this work the idea of ref .",
    "@xcite is investigated . according to that idea",
    ", a chain may be realized by connecting together basic inextensible units , like for instance small bars . in this way ,",
    "the length of all elements of the resulting chain is always constant by construction without the need of imposing the cumbersome holonomic constraints that are otherwise necessary to enforce the property of inextensibility .",
    "constraints are still necessary in order to connect together the basic units , but they are very simple and their imposition is straightforward . in deriving the generating functional for a system of this kind , however , the fact that the basic inextensible units are not point - like objects , but rigid bodies with rotational degrees of freedom , is the origin of several complications . for this reason , in this work the basic inextensible units are built starting from a number @xmath3 of beads of diameter @xmath4 , called hereafter spheres .",
    "the motion of the spheres is constrained in such a way that they stay aligned along a segment of fixed length .",
    "the shape of the whole system formed by the @xmath3 spheres is that of a shish - kebab and offers a good approximation of a bar .",
    "let us note that the constraints needed in order to form the shish - kebabs consist in conditions on the distances between pairs of points .",
    "thus we can apply the same strategy used to implement the inextensibility constraints in the fhc , which are of the same type . in the limit in which the number of spheres approaches infinity and",
    "their radius becomes vanishingly small , while the length of the basic units remains constant , one obtains what has been called here the freely jointed bar chain or simply fjbc .",
    "this is a discrete chain composed by one - dimensional bars with uniform distribution of mass .",
    "the expression of the generating functional of the correlation functions of the shish - kebab chain has been provided in the most general case of a chain containing @xmath5 basic units , each composed by a number @xmath3 of beads .",
    "the generating functional of the fjbc in the limit @xmath6 and @xmath7 has been derived . as discussed in @xcite , the constraints that are needed to held together",
    "the basic units are almost trivial and the associated spurious degrees of freedom can be easily eliminated .",
    "finally , the continuous limit of the generating functional of the fjbc has been performed . in this case",
    "several simplifications occur and , at the end , it has been possible to prove that the generating functional of the resulting continuous system coincides with the gnl@xmath2 m .",
    "this is an expected result , because in the continuous limit the mechanical details of the underlying discrete chain should not play any role .",
    "the material presented in this paper is organized as follows . in section [ section : classical ]",
    "the classical aspects of the fhc and the fjbc are analyzed .",
    "for the interested reader , a more extensive discussion on this subject can be found in ref .",
    "first , the case of the fhc is briefly reviewed .",
    "next , the fjbc is studied .",
    "it is shown that , while the kinetic and potential energies of the fjbc differ considerably from those of the fhc , they coincide in the continuous limit .",
    "the discussion of the classical aspects of the chain dynamics is very important to establish a mathematically convenient description of the fjbc , that will be used later to study its statistical dynamics .",
    "the classical dynamics of inextensible chains is also very interesting for concrete applications ranging from cosmetics to computer graphics .",
    "section [ section : statistical ] is dedicated to the statistical dynamics of the chain . in the first part of that section , the generating functional of the correlation functions of the radius vectors which specify the positions of the beads of the fhc",
    "is derived in path integral form .",
    "the constraints required by the fact that the length of the links connecting the beads is constant are imposed by using elastic potentials as explained before . when the strength of these potentials becomes infinite , the path integral formulation of the generating functional of the fhc given in ref .",
    "@xcite is recovered . in the continuous limit the gnl@xmath2 m is obtained .",
    "we fill also a gap of our previous publications concerning the fhc by establishing the connection of the partition function of the fhc with a stochastic process described by a fokker ",
    "planck equation . in the second part of section  [ section : statistical ] the generating functional of the fjbc in the shish - kebab approximation is derived .",
    "next , in section  [ section : four ] we compute the generating functional of the fjbc without any approximation . in analogy with what happens in the classical case",
    ", it turns out that this generating functional is very different from that of the fhc .",
    "however , we are able to show that they both coincide in the limit of a continuous chain . finally , our conclusions are drawn in section  [ section : conclusions ] .",
    "we begin by studying the dynamics of a chain composed by @xmath5 beads of mass @xmath8 joined together by @xmath9 massless segments of length @xmath1 .",
    "though it is not strictly necessary , to avoid complications with the spherical coordinates in arbitrary dimensions , in this section the discussion will be limited to two dimensional chains moving on the @xmath10 plane .",

    "the full procedure to pass to the continuous limit ( [ contlim ] ) is described in ref .",
    "@xcite and will not be discussed here .",
    "the new parameter @xmath30 appearing in ( [ rere ] ) is the arc  length that measures the distance between two points on the chain .",
    "partial derivatives with respect to @xmath30 will be denoted with a prime , for instance @xmath33 .",
    "we also need to express the mass of the beads @xmath8 as a function of @xmath1 . to this purpose",
    ", we introduce the density of mass @xmath34 on the chain .",
    "since the mass distribution is uniform  all beads have the same mass  we may put @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the total mass of the chain .",
    "thus , @xmath8 can be written as a function of the mass density : @xmath37 it is easy to check that , for consistency , @xmath38 because @xmath39 . applying the above prescriptions , it is possible to show that the continuous kinetic energy @xmath40 is given by : @xmath41 let us note that the expression of @xmath42 given above is different from that of ref .",

    "<S> in the present work the dynamics of a continuous inextensible chain is studied . </S>",
    "<S> the chain is regarded as a system of small particles subjected to constraints on their reciprocal distances . </S>",
    "<S> it is proposed a treatment of systems of this kind based on a set langevin equations in which the noise is characterized by a non - gaussian probability distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the method is explained in the case of a freely hinged chain . in particular , the generating functional of the correlation functions of the relevant degrees of freedom which describe the conformations of this chain is derived . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that in the continuous limit this generating functional coincides with a model of an inextensible chain previously discussed by one of the authors of this work . </S>",
    "<S> next , the approach developed here is applied to a inextensible chain , called the freely jointed bar chain , in which the basic units are small extended objects . </S>",
    "<S> the generating functional of the freely jointed bar chain is constructed . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that it differs profoundly from that of the freely hinged chain . despite the differences </S>",
    "<S> , it is verified that in the continuous limit both generating functionals coincide as it is expected . </S>"
