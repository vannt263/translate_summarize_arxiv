    "the last step in comparing theoretical isochrones to globular cluster colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) is the transformation of luminosity and effective temperature into brightness and colour .",
    "while there are a number of both theoretical and empirical sets of transformations available , this last step is , nonetheless , difficult and critical .",
    "known shortcomings in the theoretical transformations which are obtained from theoretical non - grey model atmospheres calculations are , e.g. , incomplete line lists for the opacity computation which affect the derived spectra and broad - band colours , the treatment of atmospheric convection which affects the colour determination as well ( @xcite ) , and an incomplete coverage of the @xmath6@xmath7 and composition parameter space , while empirical relations are naturally based on a limited number of stars .",
    "the transformations of kurucz and coworkers ( @xcite ; @xcite ) have well - known problems with the colours of red giants ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , but are nevertheless widely used .",
    "it is generally believed that the bolometric corrections , which are more important for most methods of cluster age determinations , are reliable , at least in their differential properties , and indeed results based on different transformations are in reasonable agreement ( @xcite ) .",
    "as long as there are no unified stellar models available , which treat the stellar interior and the non - grey atmosphere together in one complete and realistic model ( but see @xcite for a first unified solar model ) , such transformations are the only way to produce observable photometric quantities .    there is also the persistent concern about the unsolved problem of superadiabatic convection in the envelopes of cool stars , which determines surface temperature and thus colour . in our own calculations",
    "we have used the standard mixing - length theory with one constant value for the mixing - length parameter , because even with this very simplistic choice we are able to match both the solar radius and the effective temperature of metal - poor giants ( @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of a rather constant value for this parameter is also supported by comparing stellar models with the structure of convective envelopes computed by means of 2-dimensional hydrodynamical models ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , there are other convection theories possible ( @xcite ) , which lead to different @xmath8 along an isochrone compared to the standard mixing - length approach .",
    "the discussion in this paper is therefore restricted to our own treatment of convection , and the conclusions could be different for a different choice .    the confidence in ages derived from theoretical isochrones is higher if the isochrone is able to reproduce the complete cmd from the lower main sequence ( ms ) to the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) to high accuracy , even if in practice only single points along the isochrone may be used for determining the cluster age ( e.g.  turn - off and horizontal branch ) .",
    "reliable colours become crucial for methods that use colour differences , e.g.  that between turn - off ( to ) and rgb , for ( absolute ) age determinations , for determining distance and age from the ms - fitting technique , or for deriving correct integrated colours from theoretical isochrones , which constitutes an necessary step for studying old stellar populations in unresolved galaxies .    in our previous papers on this subject ( @xcite ; @xcite , `` sw97 '' ; @xcite , `` sw98 '' ) we have taken great care to find transformations from the theoretical hertzsprung - russell - diagram ( hrd ) to the cmd in @xmath9 , which give a satisfying fit for _ all _ metallicities ranging now from @xmath10 } = -2.3 $ ] to @xmath11 .",
    "we found that a combination of the transformations of and ( with an appropriate colour shift of the latter ones to enforce continuity in ( b - v ) at the common temperature of 6000 k ) satisfied our needs .",
    "work on globular cluster ( gc ) dating during the last few years has received new attention . due to improved models and methods and lately due to hipparcos - based distances to clusters , much lower",
    "ages are obtained than before , such that , at this time , no serious conflict between cluster ages and the age of the universe exists ( sw98 ; @xcite ) . in order to extend our work to a larger sample of galactic halo clusters and in particular to those of the bulge (",
    "both needed for questions about the formation of the galaxy ) , it is necessary to work in the @xmath12cmd - band refers to the cousins system ] , because there is now an increasing number of high - quality observations of clusters in @xmath12 .",
    "however , up to now , well - tested isochrones for this colour have not been available .    in this paper , we demonstrate that existing empirical and theoretical transformations provide very different @xmath13 relationships with only very few being in agreement with each other . for the choice as to",
    "which transformation we apply to our isochrones , we want to see the following requirements being fulfilled : ( i ) the transformation should give rgb colours consistent with the determined age ; ( ii ) an isochrone that fits a cluster well in @xmath2 , should do so in @xmath0 , too , for e(v - i ) values compatible with the corresponding e(b - v ) . in sect .  2 we will present a number of recently published theoretical and empirical transformations and apply them to our theoretical isochrones",
    ". we will show that considerable differences in the resulting colours exist and that a priori there is no preferred transformation to be selected .",
    "however , at the same time the reliability of the bolometric correction in @xmath1 will be reconfirmed",
    ". we will provide arguments for our selection of transformations for ms and rgb . in sect .  3 , we will then present tests verifying its usefulness for the case of our own isochrones applied to globular clusters of various metallicities . by no means",
    "this rather pragmatic approach is what one really wants for isochrone fittings , but at present it appears to be the only approach promising convincing results .",
    "finally , a discussion and summary closes the paper ( sect .  4 ) .",
    "for the purpose of this investigation we have used a number of recently published transformations , which we briefly describe in the following :     ( @xcite ; @xcite , `` bk92 '' ) : this is the source for synthetic colours we have been using in our previous papers , showing that an appropriate combination ( henceforth called `` bk '' ) yields satisfactory cmd - fits for all metallicities in the @xmath9 plane .",

    "once the @xmath23 zero point is calibrated as we did for bk ( see above and sw98 ) , the different scales agree within 0.05 mag all along the isochrones and on the zahb ; moreover , the brightness differences between to and zahb for fixed age and metallicity agree again within 0.05 mag .",
    "this confirms once more the consistency of the absolute ages derived in sw97 and sw98 .    as a final demonstration of the usefulness of the bk - transformations applied to our isochrones ,",

    "the data for m68 ( @xcite ) are the same as in our previous papers , while we used the latest photometry by for 47  tuc .",
    "we briefly recall that the ages of the clusters are derived from the brightness difference between the zahb ( defined as the lower envelope of the observed hb stellar distribution ; see sw97 for more details ) and to ; this permits to derive the cluster age independently of the knowledge of the cluster distance and reddening ( due to the horizontal nature of the hb ) , but of course the theoretical zahb models provide a distance .",
    "therefore , the distance modulus is derived by comparing the theoretical zahb level to the observed one , while the reddening is obtained from fitting the unevolved theoretical ms to the cluster one . for 47  tuc",
    "we recover with the new photometric data exactly the same age , reddening and distance modulus as in sw98 , where we were using the older composite photometry by .",

    "we obtain again a direct @xmath13 transformation which is displayed in fig .  [ figrgbvi ] .    , but for the red giant branch and zahb ]    [ figrgbvi ]    it immediately is evident from these illustrations that colour differences up to between 0.05 and 0.10 mag exist all along the isochrone and that there are no two transformations yielding the same result for all evolutionary stages .",
    "this problem persists for other metallicities as well and is , of course , not restricted to our isochrones , but would be similar for any other .",
    "part of the mismatch between the different transformations might be attributed to differences in the composition ( of model atmospheres or observed stellar samples ) , to different or inappropriate assumptions in theory ( e.g.  convection theory , line lists , lte - conditions ) and to the internal spread in the empirical relations .",
    "since the width of the upper ms and the rgb in high - quality photometry is at most as large as 0.05 mag , it is evident that whatever transformation is chosen as it was published , isochrones can deviate from the cmd structures by at least the width of the branches in colour .",

    "only due to the enormous scale of the colour axis the agreement appears to be excellent .",
    "globally , over all temperatures , the agreement is indeed very good , but not sufficient for such narrow structures as the rgb in galactic gc .    along the ms , the empirical relation by does not support any theoretical transformation .",

    "this latter fact implies that the derivative @xmath34/@xmath35 $ ] at a fixed value of the ms brightness , a fundamental quantity needed for applying the ms  fitting method in the @xmath1-@xmath0 plane , does depend on the particular colour transformation used .    from the results of these comparisons for the ms phase ( which are independent of the underlying theoretical isochrones ) it results that bcp98 , next - gen and aam96 @xmath13 relations reproduce acceptably well the solar constraint and , moreover ,",
    "show the same differential behaviour .",
    "if we base our objective choice of the colour transformations on the consistency with empirical constraints and with independent theoretical determinations , we have to conclude that bcp98 , next - gen or aam96 fulfill these criteria for the ms .",

    "this choice was made on the basis of which relations agree best with each other . the real justification of this choice , however , will be whether our transformation successfully fulfills the following requirements we are imposing : ( i ) for a given cluster , the fits in @xmath2 and @xmath0 should be of the same quality ; ( ii ) the reddening obtained from both colours should be consistent ; ( iii ) derived quantities as age and distance should not depend on the colour used .",

    "the newly derived age , distance and reddening are the same as in sw98 . in fig .",
    "[ fig47tucvi ] the corresponding @xmath0-diagram is shown .",
    "the reddening determined in this colour is 0.08 , which , when transformed to @xmath48 is 0.06 , differing from the expected value of 0.05 by only 0.01 mag . note",
    "that while in @xmath0 the isochrone appears to be a bit too blue for the lower rgb , it is too red by the same amount in @xmath2 .",
    "the fit is of the same quality in both colours and slightly better than that shown in sw98 for the data .    inspecting the hb of 47  tuc in @xmath0 ,",
    "one has the impression that is inclined towards the blue .",
    "this effect is not so evident in @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig47tucbv ] ) .",
    "we think it results from the fact that not all stars have both @xmath2 and @xmath0 colours and that in @xmath0 a number of redder hb stars are missing , thus making the inclination , which we ascribe to evolution on the hb , more apparent . in any case",
    ", the inclination could only be a brightness effect , independent of colour .    to conclude this section ,",
    "we have demonstrated that the @xmath8@xmath0 transformation we have constructed on the basis of two existing transformations , if applied to our own isochrones ( sw98 ) , results in cluster - cmd fits in @xmath0 which are equally good as in @xmath2 for all metallicities and yield consistent reddenings in the two colours .",
    "thus our requirements formulated at the end of the introduction and the beginning of this section are fulfilled .",
    "in this paper we tried to approach the problem of fitting theoretical isochrones to globular cluster data in @xmath0 .",
    "this is important since more and more @xmath5-band photometric data are becoming available and for some objects ( e.g.  bulge clusters ) will be the only data of quality possible .",
    "absolute ages of clusters determined by the turn - off brightness or the @xmath49-method ( see sw98 ) depend almost exclusively on the bolometric correction @xmath23 .",
    "theoretical values agree , when properly calibrated , with empirical values and also between different transformation sources .",
    "on the other hand , transformations of effective temperatures to colours differ from source to source by a rather constant level of 0.050.10 mag . from the comparisons we have shown it is evident that ( i ) there is no straightforward way to decide which transformation is the correct or best one and ( ii ) that the accuracy with which an isochrone fits a colour - magnitude - diagram does not indicate the quality of the underlying stellar evolution calculations , if the mismatch is of the order of 0.050.1 mag . while in sect .  2 we displayed @xmath0fits , the situation is the same in @xmath2 and corresponding examples and conclusions can be found in the literature ( e.g.@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the problem of inaccurate colours is not just a cosmetic one , but can influence absolute age determinations which make use of colour differences ( e.g.  that between turn - off and red giant branch ) , distances derived by means of the main - sequence  fitting technique , or integrated colours of unresolved stellar populations .",
    "finally , _ if _ a set of transformation was available which is known to reproduce colours accurately , any deviation of an isochrone from the observed cmd will indicate a real inconsistency in the isochrone . as an example we repeat that a colour mismatch of the rgb indicates ( but does not prove ) a higher helium content for 47  tuc ( sw98 ) .",
    "thus , reliable colour transformations are in principle a source for obtaining additional knowledge about cluster stars .",
    "we therefore attempted to find a preliminary solution to this problem , such that we can continue our work about cluster dating with @xmath0 data , expecting improved theoretical transformations in the meantime .",
    "we found that for ms stars the bcp98 , next - gen and aam96 @xmath13 relations reproduce acceptably well the solar constraint and , moreover , show the same differential behaviour with a rather constant offset of a few hundredths of a magnitude .",
    "we selected the bcp98 colours for our models .    on the red giant branch ,",
    "no theoretical transformation is in agreement with empirical data over all the metallicity range spanned by our isochrones , but two recent empirical sources ( m98 and bcm98 ) confirm each other quite well .",
    "since bcm98 provide metallicity - dependent relations , we use this one for the rgb . both parts ( ms and rgb )",
    "can be connected smoothly along the subgiant branch .    for the zahb colours",
    "we have derived an empirical @xmath36 relation using multicolor photometries of clusters spanning the relevant range of metallicities , and we applied this relation to our zahb models in the @xmath2 plane .    while the arguments just given have only led the way to our rather pragmatic combination of two @xmath14@xmath0 transformations , the justification for the combined and final relation comes from the tests we have performed using our own isochrones . for each of the four metallicity ranges defined in sw97 , which reach from the most metal - poor halo to the half - solar metallicity disk clusters",
    ", we selected one cluster with @xmath37-photometry ( three of them had already been used for absolute age determinations in sw98 ) .",
    "we then showed successfully that ( i ) the quality of the isochrone fit is comparable in both colours and ( ii ) the reddenings determined independently from these two fits fulfill the reddening law by either exactly or within 0.01 mag .",
    "we therefore conclude that the combination of the ( theoretical ) transformation of bcp98 for the main - sequence and the ( empirical ) one by bcm98 for giants is of sufficient accuracy as to allow us isochrone fits to globular cluster colour - magnitude - diagrams in @xmath1@xmath0 .    in a forthcoming paper we will determine cluster ages based on @xmath50-photometry , both for clusters we already have investigated in our previous papers and for clusters with @xmath50-data only . although @xmath0 is less sensitive to metallicity than @xmath2 , we found that @xmath51 ( the colour difference between turn - off and red giant branch , which we need for relative age determinations ) at fixed age is actually _ more _ metal - sensitive .",
    "our approach of grouping clusters into four metallicity bins will therefore not be accurate enough . either a finer metallicity grouping is needed ( implying a higher number of clusters for absolute age determination ) , or a purely relative age approach is needed as in .",
    "independent of this , we are still waiting for improved theoretical colour transformations , because for more metal - rich @xmath15-enhanced clusters ( e.g.  bulge clusters ) the bcm98 results can not be applied straightforwardly .",
    "the study of such clusters therefore actually requires to some extent an extrapolation of our adopted colour transformations .",
    "we are grateful to l.  girardi and i.  steele for helpful discussions and e.  mller for a careful reading of the manuscript .",
    "we thank t.  lejeune for providing an updated version of his transformations in electronic form , and an anonymous referee for his comments , which helped to improve this paper .",
