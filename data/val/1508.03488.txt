    "the standard distributions in equilibrium statistical mechanics can be derived in an appealingly straightforward fashion using the principle of maximum entropy or maxent .",
    "the procedure seems first to have been employed by gibbs @xcite , and was vigorously championed by jaynes @xcite as an example of logical inference , namely the optimal determination of a statistical description of an imperfectly specified system .",
    "the essential idea is that a system can possess an informational entropy that measures the uncertainty of an observer s perception , expressed through a probability distribution over all the configurations ( microstates ) that the system could adopt . in order to represent the situation in as objectively neutral a fashion as possible ,",
    "so the argument goes , we should select the distribution that has the greatest informational entropy , while enforcing consistency with any known properties of the system , represented as expectation values over the distribution . for various mathematical and physical reasons @xcite , the informational entropy @xmath0 of a probability distribution @xmath1 over a set of microstates labelled @xmath2 is written @xmath3 and if the constraints take the form of fixed expectation values @xmath4 of a set of microstate - dependent quantities @xmath5 , then it can be shown by way of the method of lagrange multipliers that the statistical representation that makes no unwarranted further assumptions about the system is @xmath6 $ ] where the @xmath7 are constants .",
    "so if we consider a physical system and employ the constraint that it possesses an identifiable mean energy as a consequence of being coupled to an isothermal reservoir acting as a source and sink of heat , then the optimal representation is canonical : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the system energy in microstate @xmath2 , the reservoir is characterised by a temperature @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "such a distribution would clearly represent a situation with time independent system properties .",
    "jaynes argued that similar procedures should be used to select probability density functions ( pdfs ) in more general situations , particularly for nonequilibrium stationary states @xcite .",
    "the general strategy would be to introduce constraints relating to the existence of a non - zero flux of energy or particles through or within a system and some progress along these lines has been made , for example in @xcite .",
    "principles for selecting the most probable path taken by a system have a long history ( @xcite also reviewed in @xcite ) and a similar rationale underlies the nonequilibrium statistical operator method ( nesom ) developed by zubarev and coworkers @xcite .",
    "variational principles involving the production _ rate _ of entropy in stationary states have also been proposed @xcite as well as the maximisation of _ relative _ entropy @xcite .    a puzzling aspect of maxent , however , is that the selection of the prevailing constraints appears to be rather arbitrary .",
    "for example , if a system is exposed to a heat reservoir such that an expectation value of energy is identifiable and therefore relevant to the maxent procedure , then why are the expectation values of additional functions of energy not relevant ? why does a term proportional to @xmath12^{2}$ ] not appear in the exponent of the canonical distribution in addition to @xmath9 ?",
    "an argument is often made that constraints are placed upon dynamically conserved quantities , which would exclude arbitrary functions of energy , but this strongly suggests that dynamics must underpin the procedure .",
    "it is our aim here to demonstrate that the framework of stochastic thermodynamics can provide the underlying dynamics in the derivation of the maxent principle .    in section",
    "[ sec : stochastic - dynamics - and ] we give a brief overview of stochastic thermodynamics , discussing the way in which ( stochastic ) entropy production is both a reflection of the mechanical irreversibility of the underlying stochastic dynamics and the basis of a measure of the change in microstate - level uncertainty of a system with time .",
    "we describe how the total entropy production may usefully be separated into three components , each with a specific character . in section",
    "[ sec : dynamical - maxent - selection ] we discuss the dynamics of mean total entropy production for a system subject to a conservative force field and coupled to an isothermal reservoir , arguing that this viewpoint provides a route to the canonical solution to the stochastic dynamics , and showing how this maps onto the traditional maxent variational principle .",
    "we see how the constraints on the variational procedure emerge as a result of the dynamical coupling of the system to the reservoir .",
    "only one of the three components of entropy production is non - zero in this case .    in section [ sec : nonisothermal ]",
    "we consider a nonequilibrium situation where a system is exposed to a background temperature gradient and show that the stationary state may be selected by the maximisation of the mean relaxational or nonadiabatic entropy production , one of the three components , or equivalently by requiring the increment in this component to be zero for all possible dynamical scenarios .",
    "we note that the average of the remaining two components accounts for a recently discussed anomaly in entropy production between over- and underdamped treatments @xcite . supporting analysis",
    "is provided in appendix [ sec : components - of - stochastic ] and a system driven by a nonconservative force under isothermal conditions is discussed in appendix [ sec : particle - in - a ] .",
    "we give our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "stochastic thermodynamics is based on a set of stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) that describe the evolution of system dynamical variables @xcite , together with a definition of the entropy production associated with a possible realisation of the motion @xcite .",
    "we focus our discussion on the motion in one spatial dimension of a single particle coupled to a set of heat reservoirs , each corresponding to a given position of the particle .",
    "the motion is described by the following it@xmath13-rules sdes : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the particle position and velocity , respectively , @xmath17 is time , @xmath18 is the friction coefficient , @xmath19 is a spatially dependent force field acting on the particle , assumed for the moment to be related to a potential @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the particle mass , @xmath22 is a spatially dependent reservoir temperature and @xmath23 is an increment in a wiener process .",

    "in the situation under consideration , the latter can be written as a product of the probability density @xmath29 of a microstate with @xmath30 and @xmath31 at @xmath32 , and a conditional probability density that the specified trajectory is followed thereafter .",
    "the dynamics are also capable of generating an _ antitrajectory _ after an inversion of the particle velocity at time @xmath33 , and under the influence of a reversed time evolution of the force field and reservoir temperature , if relevant @xcite , until a total time @xmath34 has elapsed . in this period",

    "the antitrajectory @xmath37 is the ` time - reversed ' partner of @xmath25 @xcite .",

    "all _ feasible trajectories will vanish .",

    "together , they represent a positive increment in the energy of the local reservoir ( which we may regard as a heat transfer @xmath44 to that reservoir ) divided by the local temperature .",
    "this would then correspond to a clausius - type incremental change @xmath45 in the entropy of the local reservoir in the interval of time @xmath43 .",

    "( [ eq : s3av ] ) . if the stationary pdf is velocity symmetric , however , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ds3 ] ) shows that @xmath69 is identically zero . since a velocity asymmetric stationary pdf",
    "is typically associated with a non - zero mean flux of some kind , and also with an underlying breakage of the principle of detailed balance in the stochastic dynamics @xcite , this component arises in situations where there is a nonequilibrium stationary state .",
    "it was designated the transient housekeeping entropy production by spinney and ford @xcite .",
    "@xmath57 is also associated with a nonequilibrium stationary state , since a non - zero rate of change of its average over all possible realisations of the dynamics requires there to be a non - zero current @xmath79 in the stationary state .",
    "the rate of change of the average @xmath57 is non - negative @xcite , but is non - zero in a nonequilibrium stationary state , in contrast to the rate of change of the average @xmath56 which would then be zero .",
    "this is the most distinctive difference between these two components of entropy production .",
    "esposito and van den broeck referred to @xmath57 as the adiabatic entropy production ( and they considered it only in the context of the dynamics of even coordinates such as position ) , and spinney and ford , who considered odd coordinates such as velocity as well , denoted it the generalised housekeeping entropy production .",
    "other separations of total entropy production into three components are possible @xcite , but the choice employed here has the advantage that the @xmath60 component vanishes in the absence of velocity variables in the dynamics , and on average its rate of change in a stationary state is also zero .",
    "as a system approaches stationarity , all three kinds of entropy production take place , but in the stationary state only @xmath57 and @xmath60 can potentially receive increments .",
    "the mean total entropy production rate in the stationary state is represented by @xmath80 alone .",
    "if detailed balance holds , both @xmath57 and @xmath60 would be zero .",
    "our proposal is that the monotonic increase in @xmath62 towards a ceiling , or equivalently the vanishing of @xmath61 in the stationary state , underpins maxent for equilibrium situations , and offers an extension of the procedure to nonequilibrium circumstances .",
    "we now explore the implications of this viewpoint for isothermal and then nonisothermal situations .",
    "if the reservoirs were isothermal ( @xmath81 ) , then irrespective of the initial conditions , the system under consideration should relax under the stochastic dynamics to an equilibrium state with zero irreversible probability current and canonical statistics .",
    "let us examine how this works out dynamically and thermodynamically .",
    "we presume that the contributions @xmath82 and @xmath69 are zero throughout as a consequence of the associated condition of detailed balance in the dynamics , as suggested by the velocity symmetry of the expected canonical pdf .",
    "this can be checked later .",
    "if the change in total entropy production is indeed entirely given by @xmath61 then the total entropy production satisfies not only the incremental representation in terms of system and reservoir contributions in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) and ( [ eq:4 ] ) , but also the mean behaviour represented by eq .",

    "the equilibrium state will be achieved when @xmath84 becomes time - independent .",
    "we argue that eqs .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) are equivalent to the maximisation of a constrained gibbs system entropy over the range of possible pdfs , namely a maxent procedure .",
    "the maximisation would have its origin in the dynamics , and would not arise merely from considerations of logical inference .    to support this viewpoint , we note that the incremental transfer of energy @xmath44 to the reservoir , that specifies the entropy production @xmath85 in eq .",

    "( [ eq:7 ] ) may be written @xmath96 , the dynamical increase and saturation of @xmath84 , irrespective of the initial pdf , is , we argue , equivalent to the functional maximisation of the quantity @xmath97 with respect to the pdf .",

    "the canonical distribution can be identified by a constrained maximisation of the informational entropy of the system .",
    "it is significant to observe that the only constraint that has to be taken into account involves the average of the energy , and that this has its origin in the production of entropy in the reservoir brought about by the dynamics of energy exchange between reservoir and the system .",
    "no constraints on other functions of energy should be included in the procedure .",
    "furthermore , the lagrange multiplier need not be deduced later on to make the result conform to the canonical distribution ; its value had been fixed when writing down the original stochastic dynamical equations . finally , it is easy to check using eq .",
