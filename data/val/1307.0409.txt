    "the famous thomson problem  @xcite is to find , for an arbitrary natural number @xmath0 , a configuration of @xmath0 classical electrons on the unit sphere , @xmath2 , that minimizes the coulomb energy .",

    "the apparent obstacle is strong evidence suggesting that the ground state for the coulomb potential in two dimensions has a hexagonal structure .",

    "because stable configurations differ from the minimal configuration in location and structure of defects , a related question is : how much does the average energy of stable configurations differ from the true minimal energy ?",
    "we answer this empirically by developing a large library of stable configurations and comparing the resulting average energy of the stable configurations with the lowest observed energy .",
    "minimal energy is often approximated in an asymptotic expansion , in @xmath0 , and we compare the difference between the average and lowest observed energy with the terms in these asymptotic expansions .",
    "that is , we empirically identify the terms in the asymptotic expansion that approximate the lowest observed energy , but not the average energy .",
    "we believe that these terms likely reflect characteristics of defects .",
    "this work has value in several ways .",
    "first , because the energy of any configuration of points on the sphere is an upper bound for the minimal energy , these results provide a lower bound for the difference between the average energy of stable configurations and the minimal energy .",
    "second , there are methods that have a controllable error bound for quickly approximating the pairwise energy , most notably the fast multipole method  @xcite . for",
    "such approximations the results in this paper will help select the error bound necessary to distinguish stable configurations from minimal configurations .",

    "additionally , we examine and extend some conjectures regarding the second order term for the thomson problem . in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we summarize our results .",
    "some of the earliest computational work on the thomson problem was done by erber and hockney  @xcite where they rely on optimization techniques to search for minimal energy configurations .",
    "rakhmanov , saff and zhou  @xcite presented a comprehensive search for the minimal energies for @xmath0 up to @xmath9 for the logarithmic as well as coulomb energies .",
    "morris , deavon and ho  @xcite used a genetic algorithm in an effort to avoid becoming trapped in stable non - minimal configurations . an important effort to constructively generate candidate minimal energy configurations came from altschuler , williams , ratner , tipton , stong , dowla and wooten  @xcite , where the authors of that paper identified configurations with twelve point defects and high symmetry .",
    "these configurations were later shown not to be minimal by prez - garrido , dodgson , moore , ortuno and diaz - sanchez  @xcite and prez - garrido , dodgson , moore  @xcite .",
    "these authors found that , as @xmath0 increased , the defects were not point defects , but had considerable structure such as those in figure  [ fig : sample ] .",
    "efforts to understand and characterize this structure , as well as find minimal energy configurations , include the work of wales and ulker  @xcite and wales , mckay and altschuler  @xcite .",
    "the results of the experiments described in these two publications are collected in the cambridge cluster database  @xcite@xcite , and provide , to our knowledge , the lowest observed energies for the thomson problem .",
    "bowick , cacciuto , nelson and travesset  @xcite use a continuum elasticity model to describe the interaction of defects . in these works the empirical evidence is that configurations with low energy consist of a `` hexagonal sea '' with complex defects at the vertices of an icosahedron inscribed in @xmath2 .",
    "theoretical examinations of the thomson problem provide valuable insights and language for the problem , and we review some of the relevant theory here .",
    "let @xmath10 denote a set @xmath11 of @xmath0 distinct points in @xmath12 .",
    "we consider the following discrete energy of @xmath10 @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the function given by @xmath15 and where @xmath16 is the euclidean norm inherited from @xmath12 .",
    "note that many papers on this topic report an energy where the second sum is over @xmath17 leading to a factor of two difference in our values for energy .",
    "the functions , @xmath14 , are the riesz potentials , which are a natural generalization of the coulomb potential . the questions in which we are interested apply to riesz potentials in general , and we present results for the riesz potentials corresponding to @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",

    "one may interpret @xmath35 as a continuous charge distribution and consider the energy functional defined for any @xmath36 , by @xmath37 analogous to the discrete point energy , @xmath38 , the potential due to @xmath39 at a point @xmath40 , is @xmath41 there is a unique energy - minimizing measure @xmath42 so that @xmath43 ( cf .",

    "further , @xmath44 for all @xmath45 with the possible exception of a set that supports no measures of finite energy ( cf .",
    "* theorem 2.4 ) ) .",
    "roughly speaking equation   asserts that the potential is constant in regions where there is charge .",
    "the essence of the proof is that , if this were not the case , energy could be decreased by moving charge from regions of high potential to regions of low potential .",
    "the celebrated transfinite diameter result of plya and szeg relates the continuous and discrete problems as follows ( also cf .",
    "@xcite ) : for any continuous function @xmath46 and any sequence of energy - minimizing configurations @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 for this range of @xmath1 the discrete minimal energy configurations are converging in the weak - star topology of measures to @xmath50 .",
    "the minimal energy grows as @xmath51 , where the coefficient is given by @xmath52 .",
    "the proof of these results indicates that the first order approximation of the minimal energy is determined by the global distribution of points within energy minimizing configurations .",
    "kuijlaars and saff have shown  @xcite that the second order term on the sphere in the expansion   grows as @xmath53 and the , still to be proven , coefficient is conjectured to depend on the presumed local hexagonal structure .    if @xmath54 , then @xmath55 for all @xmath56 , ( cf .",
    "8) ) and other techniques are required to estimate growth in minimal energy .",
    "hardin and saff  @xcite and borodachov , hardin and saff  @xcite show that when @xmath25 has certain smoothness properties @xmath57 and @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the @xmath31 dimensional hausdorff measure restricted to @xmath25 , @xmath60 is a constant that depends only on @xmath31 and @xmath1 and not the underlying set @xmath25 , and @xmath61 is the closed unit ball in @xmath62 .",
    "these results demonstrate that for @xmath54 the asymptotic distribution of points in energy - minimizing configurations is uniform .",
    "furthermore , the minimal @xmath0-point energy grows at a rate exceeding @xmath51 and is determined largely by the local structure of the energy minimizing configurations .",
    "indeed for the @xmath63 case , numerical evidence supports the conjecture that @xmath60 is given by a hexagonal zeta function evaluated at @xmath1 , i.e. the sum of the reciprocal non - zero distances in the hexagonal lattice raised to the power @xmath1 .",
    "brauchart , hardin and saff present a summary of theory and conjecture regarding minimal energy configurations on the sphere  @xcite .",
    "to generate candidate configurations we begin with a random , well - separated , initial configuration of points on @xmath2 and alternate between the polak - ribire variant of conjugate gradient ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) with a line minimization of the energy , and an exact newton s method to find a root of the gradient . to solve the linear system arising in newton s method we use lapack  @xcite .",
    "we use a direct evaluation of the energy sum , given in equation   omitting obvious duplicate calculations , which involves @xmath64 terms , the smallest of which is @xmath65 , while @xmath66 can grow into the hundreds of millions for some values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 considered . to control the numerical round - off error",
    "associated with adding two numbers whose ratio is far from unity ( cf .",
    "@xcite for relevant work on this problem ) we logarithmically bin our summands . by only adding summands in the same bin , we bound the ratio of any two intermediate summands to be added .",
    "the final sum is computed by iterating over our bins in increasing magnitude and summing their contents .    for @xmath67 we ran thousands of trials . for @xmath68 we ran tens to hundreds of trials .",
    "we report lowest observed energies on the sphere only for those @xmath0 where the cambridge cluster database provides a configuration with which we can initialize our solver .",
    "the above optimization process leads to a candidate configuration @xmath10 , which we assume is close enough to a true stable configuration @xmath69 so that the linear approximation about @xmath10 for the gradient @xmath70 is reasonable . here",
    "@xmath71 is the gradient of the energy with respect to the free parameters that define @xmath10 and @xmath72 is the hessian represented in the same coordinates .",
    "were the hessian invertible this would lead to the bound @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the smallest eigenvalue of the hessian , @xmath75 is the unnormalized two - norm of the parameters defining the argument , and @xmath76 is the associated operator two - norm .",
    "our choice of coordinates leads to three degrees of freedom corresponding to rigid motions of the sphere and so the smallest three eigenvalues of the hessian are zero .",
    "we assume a rotation and reflection of @xmath69 so that the difference between @xmath77 and @xmath10 and does not reflect these rigid motions .",
    "we let @xmath78 denote the fourth lowest eigenvalue , then we have the bound @xmath79 we desire that @xmath80 our reasoning is that the free parameters are the polar and azimuthal angles , and , on the unit sphere , changes in position are always bounded from above by changes in angle .",
    "the above bound will ensure that no point in @xmath10 is further from its corresponding point in the true stable state by more than the arbitrary bound of one ten - thousandth of the minimum separation in @xmath10 .",
    "this is ensured if @xmath81 where , again , we used lapack to compute @xmath78 .",
    "we reiterate that these estimates hinge on the assumption that the gradient at the true stable state is well approximated by a linear expansion of the gradient about the observed state .",
    "we keep candidate configurations if equation   holds or if the configuration possesses the lowest observed energy .    note that equation   is quite stringent . as @xmath0 increases",
    ", the minimum pairwise separation between points goes as @xmath82 .",
    "in addition we have bounded from above the infinity - norm with the unnormalized two - norm .",
    "such a bound is tight only when all the components but one are zero .",
    "this condition was relaxed for @xmath8 , where we simply required that all but lowest three eigenvalues be positive .      in figure",
    "[ fig : frac_avg ] one can see the average fraction of points that have six - sided voronoi cells . for each @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "these data are obtained by computing this fraction per configuration , and then averaging over all the observed configurations and weighting by the number of times the configuration occurred .",
    "this is the same averaging method we use when computing the average energy of stable configurations .",
    "as one can see this average fraction is better than @xmath83 percent for @xmath84 , supporting the claim that stable configurations are largely hexagonal .    as a point of comparison ,",
    "we ve also computed this fraction for the configurations that have the lowest observed energy .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : frac_min ] .",
    "one important feature of this plot is that the configurations with the lowest observed energy have far more non - six - sided voronoi cells than the minimum allowed if no voronoi cell has fewer than five sides .",
    "if one further assumes that no voronoi cell has more than seven sides , then the number of voronoi cells with other than six sides must be even .",
    "this corroborates previous observation that as @xmath0 increases , the defects cease to be single points and develop structure .",
    "this plot shows the fraction of points that have six - sided voronoi cells for @xmath0 and for the values of @xmath1 in which we are interested .",
    "the inset plot provides more detail for @xmath85 .",
    "in addition we ve plotted the upper bound for this fraction assuming that no voronoi cell has fewer than five sides .",
    "each data point is averaged over all the configurations , weighted by number of occurrences , for the specified @xmath0 and @xmath1.,height=340 ]     as in figure  [ fig : frac_avg ] we ve plotted the fraction of points that have six - sided voronoi cells . here",
    "each data point corresponds to the configuration with the lowest observed energy . in the outer plot the solid line is the upper bound on this fraction , while the dashed line indicates what this fraction would be if there were @xmath86 defects each consisting of a three points with five , seven and five sided voronoi cells respectively . in the inset",
    "one sees lines corresponding to @xmath87 non six - sided voronoi cells.,height=340 ]",
    "in this section we compare theory and conjecture for the minimal @xmath0-point energy with the lowest observed @xmath0-point energy . in the case",
    "@xmath7 we extend a conjecture for the second order term on @xmath2 to certain smooth manifolds .",
    "we report the asymptotics of the difference between the average and minimal observed energies and compare this difference with terms in the asymptotic expansion .",
    "like all computational works of this type , we have no assurances that the lowest available energies are indeed minimal .",
    "systematic errors of this type would cause us to underestimate the difference between the average and the minimal energies . consequently our results that indicate that a term in the asymptotic expansion does not describe both the average and minimal energy should be trusted more than results indicate that a term does describe both the average and minimal energies .",
    "we shall use the following notation : @xmath88 is the lowest _ observed _ minimal @xmath0-point @xmath1-energy on a set @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath89 is the difference between the minimal @xmath0-point @xmath1-energy on @xmath25 and an @xmath90-term asymptotic expansion of the minimal @xmath1-energy , while @xmath91 is the difference between the lowest _ observed _ energy and the @xmath90-term expansion .",
    "this is the thomson problem , and the leading order term in the asymptotic expansion of the minimal energy follows from the transfinite diameter result in equation  , i.e. for a set @xmath25 of dimension @xmath92 it is @xmath93 . for the sphere",
    "a simple calculation shows that @xmath94 .",
    "we now review an existing conjecture for the second order term on @xmath2 , and show how it may be generalized for compact @xmath20-manifold @xmath25 .",
    "a trivial representation of the first order term and the correction for a set @xmath25 is @xmath95 we shall consider the case that @xmath96 is absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath59 , the support of @xmath96 is all of @xmath25 , and equation   holds for the entire support of @xmath96 , that is @xmath97 for all @xmath98 .",
    "these assumptions are satisfied for @xmath99 .",
    "the potential @xmath100 is linear in @xmath39 and so , with our assumptions , we may write equation   as @xmath101    the above equation is exact regardless of where on @xmath25 we choose to evaluate the potential @xmath102 .",
    "however , choosing to evaluate the potential at the points that form a minimal @xmath0-point configuration suggests one way to express the correction : the point energy for @xmath103 should be corrected by subtracting the potential at @xmath103 due to @xmath0 times the equilibrium measure and adding the energy due to the presence of the @xmath104 other discrete points . in broader terms",
    "the point at @xmath103 sees other discrete points , not a smoothed out average density .    for the @xmath6 point",
    ", the correction given by equation   may be written as two terms , which we refer to as `` near '' and `` far '' contributions .",
    "@xmath105    this decomposition is motivated by the reasoning presented by kuijlaars and saff  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) , namely that the second order correction for @xmath106 is determined by the local structure .",
    "where kuijlaars and saff use a cutoff at radius @xmath107 , we use an exponential damping that allows use of the poisson summation formula and ewald type arguments for the @xmath7 case .",
    "we fix @xmath108 small enough so that @xmath109 changes on a scale much larger than @xmath107 , and we consider @xmath0 large enough so that the nearest neighbor distance is much smaller than @xmath107 .",
    "then for most @xmath110 we can expect a local hexagonal structure around @xmath103 and so we consider the following estimate for the near term in equation  : @xmath111 @xmath112 here @xmath113 is the hexagonal lattice of unit spacing , @xmath114 is the hexagonal lattice where the generating vectors have been scaled by @xmath115 , and @xmath116 is the area of the fundamental cell of the scaled lattice .",
    "finally , @xmath117 denotes integration with respect to area .",
    "the essential statement of the approximation in equation   is that , for most points in a configuration with low energy , the energy due to neighboring points is well approximated by the energy due to the neighboring points in an appropriately scaled hexagonal lattice , and that the density represented by equilibrium measure changes little on the scale of nearest neighbor separation .",
    "this assumption is qualitatively supported by figure  [ fig : sample ] where most points are surrounded by a local hexagonal structure .",
    "we compute the sum over a lattice that is scaled by @xmath118 , which is intended to reflect the local point density of the energy minimizing configuration near the point @xmath103 .",
    "for the case @xmath119 , @xmath115 is independent of @xmath110 . to generalize to an arbitrary 2-manifold",
    "one may estimate @xmath115 as follows : let @xmath120 be the nearest - neighbor spacing .",
    "assume that for large @xmath0 , hence small @xmath120 , the voronoi cells within @xmath121 are all hexagonal and of the same size .",
    "this gives @xmath122 here @xmath123 indicates the number of points in the following set .",
    "@xmath124 is the area of a hexagon of inner radius @xmath125 , which is @xmath126 .",
    "the second estimate follows from the weak - star convergence of the discrete minimal energy points to the equilibrium measure and the assumption that @xmath127 is @xmath96-almost clopen",
