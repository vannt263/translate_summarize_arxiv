    "one of the most important goals of modern theoretical physics is to reconcile two of its cornerstones : general relativity ( gr ) and quantum theory ( qt ) .",
    "both theories have been extremely powerful and precise in explaining and predicting the observed phenomena .",
    "accordingly , both theories are expected to be present in some way in any future theory .",
    "the areas of applicability of general relativity ( also called the theory of gravitation ) and quantum theory are , in a way , opposite .",
    "the quantum theory is an ultimate theory of the world of microscopic particles and fields , while general relativity deals primarily with objects and processes of a macroscopic character .",
    "the theories seem to be dissimilar and incompatible in every possible way .",
    "this becomes clear already when comparing the mathematical machinery used in each theory .",
    "roughly speaking , the quantum theory is described in terms of linear operators in hilbert spaces with a heavy use of functional methods and representation theory . at the same time , general relativity is based on the finite dimensional riemannian geometry and uses primarily the methods of differential geometry and partial differential equations . in simple words ,",
    "the world of quantum theory is infinite - dimensional and primarily linear , while the world of general relativity is finite dimensional and non - linear .",
    "the theory of gravitation is naturally _ local _ , that is , physical observations at a point in the theory depend only on the state of matter and fields in the immediate neighborhood of the point .",
    "mathematically this is reflected in the fact that the equations of gravitation are partial differential equations .",
    "the quantum theory is also local as it is also described by means of differential equations .",
    "however , the locality of quantum theory does not work that well and seems to be imposed upon us by the lack of a better mathematical description .",
    "in particular , many of the difficulties in the quantum field theory ( qft ) seem to be rooted in the concept of a field at a point in space - time .",
    "this concept seems to be both necessary and contradictory leading to divergences in the theory .",
    "some of the difficulties of qft are also present in non - relativistic quantum mechanics ( qm ) in the form of the so - called _",
    "improper states_. the latter are the states , like the eigenstates of position and momentum operators , that are non - square integrable and , as a result , do not always fit nicely into the theory . at the same time , the improper states are essential as they serve as the building blocks of the quantum theory and simultaneously provide the link between the quantum and the classical worlds .",
    "indeed , the state function in qm would not be defined without our ability to measure positions of non - relativistic particles .",
    "likewise , the scattering amplitude in qft would not exist without our ability to measure momenta of free particles .",
    "simultaneously , the latter measurements ideally create improper states thereby endowing the particles with the classical mechanical properties and providing the foundation of the classical world .",
    "the mathematical difficulties related to the presence of improper states in qm are usually resolved by approximating these states , in some way , by square - integrable functions .",
    "alternatively , the improper states can be rigorously defined as functionals in the rigged hilbert space construction of gelfand ( see ref .",
    "1 ) , in which case they have no norm .",
    "both approaches make the theory somewhat awkward as the improper states , being the building blocks of the theory , are not then included in the theory on an equal footing with the square - integrable states .",
    "moreover , the latter mathematical fact is but one indication that the quantum theory , while based on the classical properties of matter , is unable to fully explain these properties .",
    "numerous other observations , both theoretical and experimental , all seem to be leading to the same conclusion of incompleteness of quantum theory .",
    "this incompleteness persists also in the advanced forms of quantum theory such as the string / m theory , which rely on a pre - existing notion of classical space - time .",
    "formulating the quantum theory in a way independent of the pre - existing classical space and of the classical properties of measuring devices becomes then a problem of fundamental importance . in light of the properties of general relativity and quantum theory discussed above , the problem expressed in a very general way",
    "consists in deriving the `` finite dimensional nonlinear world '' from the `` infinite - dimensional linear one '' .",
    "in a recent work ( refs . 6 , 7 ) improper states in quantum mechanics have been put on an equal footing with square - integrable states by means of a _ functional coordinate formalism on hilbert manifolds_. the coordinate charts on a hilbert manifold in the formalism take values in arbitrary infinite - dimensional separable hilbert spaces of functions including spaces of generalized functions .",
    "isomorphisms of these spaces are then identified with transformations of coordinates on the manifold .",
    "the resulting formalism generalizes the notion of a tensor and seems to be the most appropriate and powerful extension of the local coordinate approach to tensor fields to the case of infinitely many dimensions .",
    "the formalism demonstrates , in particular , that the improper states can be naturally included in qt if one is ready to accept that the hilbert metric on the space of states can have a different functional form in different coordinate charts and in different physical situations .",
    "furthermore , in ref .",
    "8 the local coordinate formalism of finite dimensional riemannian geometry has been naturally derived from the above functional coordinate formalism on hilbert manifolds .",
    "this opened a way of reformulating the riemannian geometry , topology and physics of classical space - time in functional terms .",
    "in fact , the geometry of the classical space itself as well as the dynamics of classical and quantum particles on the space have been _ derived _ in ref . 8 from the geometry of a hilbert space of functions of abstract parameters .",
    "to put it differently , the geometry of the classical space and the dynamics of particles on the space have been shown to be `` encoded '' into the geometry of an appropriate hilbert space of functions of abstract parameters . in particular , the formalism eliminates the need for a pre - existing classical space in quantum theory .",
    "the apparent success of the above formalism in bridging the gap between the quantum and the classical worlds supports the idea that hilbert manifolds offer an appropriate arena while the formalism itself provides an appropriate mathematical language for quantum physics . at the same time , the resulting extension of the currently accepted space - time arena is , in a way , minimal .",
    "in fact , the quantum theory already uses various infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces as an essential part of its formalism .",
    "the obtained results simply hint that hilbert spaces and , more generally , hilbert manifolds should play an even larger role in modern physics .    in the current paper",
    "we continue developing the above mentioned geometric approach by exploring the idea that quantum theory is a functional tensor theory . in other words ,",
    "the equations of quantum theory can be expressed in a form independent of any particular functional realization .",
    "this constitutes what is called in the paper the _ principle of functional relativity_. we show that the principle is a natural extension of the classical principle of relativity on space - time .",
    "simultaneously , the principle is in apparent agreement with the standard apparatus of quantum theory . by accepting the principle as a hypothesis",
    ", we explain the origin of physical dimensions , provide a geometric interpretation of planck s constant , and find a simple model of the two - slit experiment and the process of measurement .",
    "here is a plan of the paper . in sec .",
    "2 we briefly review the previously obtained results concerning the functional coordinate formalism and its applications in quantum theory . in sec .",
    "3 we relate the observables in qm with vector fields in a hilbert space and prepare the ground for a geometric interpretation of qm . in sec .",
    "4 we introduce a riemannian metric on the unit sphere @xmath0 in a hilbert space @xmath1 of square - integrable state functions and in the corresponding projective space @xmath2 and verify that the integral curves of the vector fields associated with observables are geodesics in this metric .",
    "a simpler but similar analysis is done in sec . 5 where we discuss the killing metric on the sphere @xmath3 of unit spinors and the fubini - study metric on the complex projective space @xmath4 of physical spinors .",
    "the principle of functional relativity is introduced in sec .",
    "we show that the apparatus of quantum theory is consistent with the principle of functional relativity , that classical relativity is a special case of functional relativity and that the speed of light is a functional scalar . in sec .",
    "7 we use the principle of functional relativity to investigate the origin of physical dimensions and of quantum commutators .",
    "in particular , the commutators in quantum theory are related to the curvature of the riemannian manifold @xmath0 .",
    "the process of measurement in qm is analyzed in sec .",
    "possible interpretations of the two - slit experiment and of the instantaneous nature of collapse in light of the principle of functional relativity are proposed and future applications of the theory are discussed .",
    "the paper will make an extensive use of the coordinate formalism on hilbert manifolds developed in refs .",
    "the readers is referred to ref . 9 for a mathematically rigorous introduction to the formalism and its applications .",
    "the main idea of the formalism is to associate a specific functional form of physical quantities ( e.g. , observables , states , etc . ) in qt with realization in a particular hilbert space of the corresponding invariant quantities defined on an abstract hilbert space .",
    "for instance , the ( pure ) state of a quantum system in standard qm is defined in terms of state function , which is an element of a particular hilbert space .",
    "this is similar to defining a point in space - time as a @xmath5-tuple of coordinates .",
    "the @xmath5-tuple may pick out a space - time point , but it can not be identified with the point because there are other ways of picking it out . the point itself is a _ geometric _ object , which is independent of any particular coordinates . a quantum state can be defined in a similar geometric way . in the paper",
    "the state is considered as a point in an abstract state space , called a _ string space _ and the state function in a particular hilbert space is interpreted as a kind of `` coordinate - dependent '' way of picking out a state .",
    "we remark that , except for the shared general infinite - dimensional setting , the `` string '' formalism developed here has nothing to do with either string theory or loop gravity . here",
    "are the main definitions :    a _ string space _",
    "@xmath6 is an abstract infinite - dimensional linear topological space isomorphic ( that is , topologically linearly isomorphic ) to a separable hilbert space .",
    "the elements of @xmath6 are called strings and will be denoted by the capital greek letters @xmath7    a _ hilbert space of functions _ ( or a _ coordinate space _ ) is either a hilbert space @xmath8 , elements of which are equivalence classes of maps between two given subsets of @xmath9 or the hilbert space @xmath10 dual to @xmath8 . in other words ,",
    "each equivalence class of either @xmath8 or @xmath11 contains a representative which is a numeric or a vector - valued function of @xmath12 variables or a functional on such functions .",
    "we remark here that the number of variables @xmath12 may vary from space to space .    a linear isomorphism @xmath13 from a hilbert space @xmath8 of functions onto @xmath6",

    "the string basis identifies a string with a function : if @xmath16 , then @xmath17 for a unique @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath19 be the dual string space .",
    "that is , @xmath19 is the space of all linear continuous functionals on strings .",
    "likewise , let @xmath11 be the dual of a coordinate space @xmath8 .",

    "the basis @xmath20 is called _ dual _ to the basis @xmath13 if for any string @xmath17 and for any functional @xmath21 in @xmath19 the following is true : @xmath22    in the future the action of a linear functional @xmath23 on function @xmath24 will be denoted in one of the following three ways : @xmath25 .",
    "the expressions like @xmath26 will be distinguished from the inner product of two elements in a hilbert space @xmath8 by the subscript @xmath8 in the symbol of inner product .",
    "for instance , if @xmath23 , @xmath27 are elements of @xmath8 , then their inner product will be denoted by @xmath28 .    by definition",
    "the string space @xmath6 is isomorphic to a separable hilbert space .",
    "we can furthermore assume that @xmath6 itself is an abstract hilbert space .",
    "accordingly , we will assume that the string bases @xmath29 are isomorphisms of hilbert spaces .",
    "that is , the hilbert metric on any coordinate space @xmath8 is determined by the hilbert metric on @xmath6 and the choice of a string basis .",
    "conversely , the choice of a coordinate hilbert space determines the corresponding string basis @xmath29 up to a unitary transformation . indeed , with @xmath8 fixed , any two bases @xmath29",
    ", @xmath30 can only differ by an automorphism of @xmath8 , i.e. , by a unitary transformation .",
    "assume for simplicity that @xmath8 is a real hilbert space ( generalization to the case of a complex hilbert space will be obvious ) .",
    "we have : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a bilinear form defining the inner product on @xmath6 and @xmath33 is the induced bilinear form .",
    "the expression on the right is a convenient form of writing the action of @xmath34 on @xmath35 . such an _ index notation _ will be useful in the paper .",

( [ orto1 ] ) is the usual lebesgue integral and/or a sum over a discrete index @xmath45 , the corresponding coordinate space will be called an @xmath1-space . in this case",
    "we will also say that the basis @xmath29 is _",
    "orthonormal_. if the integral is a more general lebesgue - stieltjes integral , the coordinate space defined by eq .",
    "( [ orto1 ] ) will be called an @xmath1-space with the weight @xmath46 and the basis @xmath29 will be called _ orthogonal_. roughly speaking , the metric on hilbert spaces defined by orthogonal string bases has a `` diagonal '' kernel . in particular , the kernel may be proportional to the delta - function or to the krnecker symbol .",
    "more general coordinate hilbert spaces have a `` non - diagonal '' metric ( see eq .",
    "( [ example_h ] ) for example ) .",
    "the bilinear form @xmath47 generates a linear isomorphism @xmath48 by @xmath49 .",

    "it follows from the definition that if @xmath29 is orthogonal , then @xmath8 is a space @xmath58 of square - integrable functions on a @xmath46-measurable set @xmath44 . in particular ,",
    "not every coordinate hilbert space @xmath8 can produce an orthogonal string basis @xmath13 .",
    "let us remark that the above definitions are analogous to their finite dimensional counterparts .",
    "in fact , in the case of a finite number of dimensions the definition of a string space becomes simply the definition of an abstract @xmath12-dimensional vector space @xmath59 .",
    "a string basis becomes a map from the space @xmath9 of @xmath12-tuples onto @xmath59 and can be identified with the ordinary basis on @xmath59 .",
    "likewise , the dual string basis becomes a basis dual to the ordinary basis .",
    "a similar `` correspondence rule '' is valid for all of the above definitions . at the same time , in the infinite - dimensional case the given definitions describe substantially new objects .",
    "the main property of these objects is their invariance under various isomorphisms of hilbert spaces of functions .",
    "in particular , it is important to distinguish clearly the notion of a string basis from the notion of an ordinary basis on a hilbert space .",
    "namely , a string basis permits us to represent invariant objects in string space ( strings ) in terms of functions , which are elements of a hilbert space of functions .",
    "a basis on the space of functions then allows us to represent functions in terms of numbers ; that is , in terms of the components of the functions in the basis . as already discussed , in case of a finitely many dimensions the difference disappears .",

    "so , the need for various physical dimensions may have its origin in the above identification of dimensions carried by functions and by the variables . the invariant approach to dimensions is to accept the dimension associated with functions as physical , consider the arguments of the functions as dimensionless and keep in mind that the right side of eq .",
    "( [ relation ] ) is a special case of the functionally invariant expression on the left .",
    "with this accepted we need the length , time and momentum ( or mass ) to be dimensionless physical quantities .",
    "this by itself is easy to achieve by fixing an arbitrary system of units and considering dimensionless ratios ( for example , length divided by the unit length , time divided by the unit time , etc ) . a similar `` cancellation '' of dimensions",
    "can be done in physical equations relating dimensional quantities .",
    "however , the ratios of length , time and mass will depend in this case on the chosen system of units . because of that we need a system of units that would be physical , rather than `` anthropomorphic '' .",
    "in other words , the units in such a system must be independent of any particular human convention .    such a system of units is well known and , in fact , widely used in high energy physics .",
    "it is the so - called planck system of units in which @xmath585 with @xmath586 being the constant of gravity .",
    "the units of length , time and mass in this system ( the planck length @xmath587 , time @xmath588 and mass @xmath589 ) can be expressed in terms of the standard si units as follows : @xmath590 when physical quantities are expressed in planck units they become dimensionless physically meaningful numbers ( such as length divided by the planck length , time divided by the planck time , etc . ) since the planck units are defined in terms of the physical constants @xmath591 , they would change in any physical process that changed these physical constants .",
    "at the same time the values of physical quantities would change under these circumstances in a similar fashion . because of that their expression in planck units would remain unchanged provided the dimensionless physical constants stay the same ( see ref . 5 ) .",
    "from now on we will assume that the values of physical quantities are always expressed in planck units as dimensionless ratios . then the position and momentum operators become dimensionless and have the form @xmath592 the fourier transform relates the two while preserving their dimensionlessness .",

    "for instance , an easy calculation demonstrates that the norm of superposition @xmath594 of two position eigenstates in metric @xmath223 is equal to @xmath595 in planck units is a very large number .",

    ", the evolution in an arbitrary direction of the tangent space @xmath707 is possible .",
    "assume that the initial state @xmath214 is an eigenstate of @xmath137 with the eigenvalue @xmath226",
    ". then the equation eq .",
    "( [ ash ] ) is satisfied by the function @xmath708 the solution eq .",
    "( [ ash ] ) signifies that the projection of the path @xmath272 on @xmath2 yields a trivial path .",
    "in other words , the eigenstates of observables are _ zeros _ of the projection of the vector field @xmath618 induced by the bundle projection @xmath709 .    with this in hand",
    "we make the following conjecture about the nature of quantum measurement .",
    "a classical measuring device that measures an observable @xmath137 locally curves the riemannian metric on @xmath0 or @xmath2 .",
    "this curving results in the creation of the hole - like regions ( to be called below `` holes '' ) on neighborhoods of the eigenstates of @xmath137 in @xmath0 or the corresponding points in @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , to measure position @xmath116 of a microscopic particle we may use several counters distributed in space or a photographic film . the counters or the molecules of the film play the role of the holes in @xmath710 positioned in this case along @xmath233 , i.e. , at the eigenstates of @xmath116 .",
    "similarly , to measure momentum @xmath569 of the particle , the momentum measuring devices must be gauged in the momentum variable and play the role of holes positioned along the momentum submanifold @xmath306 of @xmath279 .",
    "the evolution of a microscopic particle is a motion along a geodesics in a riemannian metric on the sphere @xmath0 or on the projective space @xmath2 .",
    "the presence of measuring devices alters the standard schrdinger evolution . when the path of a particle on @xmath0 is close ( in functional space ) to a particular hole , the particle ( i.e. the state ! )",
    "may `` collapse '' into the hole .",
    "in particular , the state of the particle in the hole will coincide with the function that describes the position of the hole , i.e. , it will be an eigenstate of the measured observable .",
    "the holes are zeros or `` equilibrium points '' of the vector field @xmath618 projected onto @xmath2 .",
    "the evolution of a particle in the hole is projectively trivial . besides the functional distance",
    ", the collapse to a particular hole may depend on a chaotic motion of the holes ( i.e. measuring molecules ) along @xmath0 .",
    "this results in a stochastic process which may account for the probabilistic character of collapse .",
    "finally , let us make a brief comment about the relationship of evolutions of macroscopic and microscopic particles in the formalism .",
    "as discussed , the image of the classical space under the embedding @xmath711 is a  spiral \" through the dimensions of @xmath237 .",
    "the standard quantum evolution of microscopic particles does not follow the `` spiral '' but rather makes a `` shortcut '' by following a geodesic of @xmath237 .",
    "in particular , the microscopic particles do not normally propagate in space @xmath233 : the path @xmath712 can hardly ever be written as a path @xmath713 in @xmath233 .",
    "only the particles of sufficiently large mass , or , more generally , those under a constant bombardment by the environment , are forced to stay on the classical space @xmath233 and evolve along the corresponding `` spiral '' in @xmath237 . for a particle of sufficiently large mass such a motion along geodesic of @xmath233",
    "can be identified with the ordinary classical motion along a straight line . alternatively and with a good approximation the motion of sufficiently fast microscopic particles in a bubble chamber",
    "would also follow a geodesic of @xmath233 .",
    "note however , that the environment related `` bombardment '' may cause a local deformation of the metric on @xmath237 along the classical space @xmath233 . in particular , @xmath233 may still turn out to be a totally geodesic submanifold of the sphere @xmath279 , i.e. , the sphere @xmath237 with an additionally deformed metric @xmath34 . in this case the geodesics on @xmath233 would also be geodesics on @xmath279 . to understand how",
    "an infinitely large classical space could be embedded totally geodesically ( and not only isometrically ! ) into an otherwise extremely small sphere @xmath279 , one can think of the classical space in figure 2 of sec .",
    "2 as a `` canyon '' on the surface of the sphere . the sphere can be small , while the `` canyon '' can be as long as one wishes , and still the curves along the bottom of the `` canyon '' could be geodesics of @xmath279 .    to become a model , the functional geometric interpretation of quantum evolution and collapse must be accompanied by the dynamical equations of motion .",
    "it was advocated here that for a single particle quantum mechanics the latter equations are simply equations of geodesics on a hilbert riemannian manifold .",
    "the derivation of these equations is then similar to derivation given in secs . 4 and 5 .",
    "however , the presence of measuring devices is now associated with an additional skewing of the metric .",
    "the problem is then to find the metric producing the needed geodesics .",
    "because of that , the derivation of specific equations of collapse becomes mathematically more involved and the problem is currently open .",
    "i would like to thank my colleague malcolm forster for his faithful interest in the formalism , for numerous questions , comments and recommendations that helped improving many parts of the paper .",
    "i also want to express my sincere gratitude to the editor of _ foundations of physics _ for his support and understanding ."
