    "characterized by extreme faintness or absence of broad emission lines in their optical / uv spectra , bl lac objects are a subset of the _ blazar _ population for which the dominant source of emission is believed to be a relativistic jet of non - thermal radiation ( e.g. , blandford & rees 1978 ; urry & padovani 1995 ) . a key optical property of blazars is large and frequently occuring rapid flux variability ( also termed as inov ) , which is not exhibited by other radio - loud or radio - quiet active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "thus , a classical , radio - selected bl lac object ( rbl ) , when monitored continuously for more than about 4 hours , is quite likely to show optical variability at the level of a few percent , on hour - like time scale ( e.g. , miller , carini & goodrich 1989 ; wagner & witzel 1995 ; romero et al .",
    "more specifically , inov amplitude @xmath6 is expected to occur in such observations , with a probability ( duty cycle : dc ) of @xmath7 ( gopal - krishna et al .",
    "2003 ; stalin et al . 2005 ) .",
    "a similar estimate ( dc @xmath8 ) is obtained using the data from an independent programme of intranight monitoring of a well defined sample of egret detected rbls ( see table 1 of romero et al .",
    "for x - ray selected blazars ( xbls ) , the inov duty cycle is about two times smaller ( romero et al .",
    "2002 ; also , heidt et al .",
    "recall that the above estimates for rbls are based on light curves of durations longer than 4 hours and therefore , for consistency , we shall stick to the same criterion while selecting any intranight light curves from the literature for the purpose of making statistical comparisons .    since recent studies ( stalin et al .",
    "2005 ; gopal - krishna et al .",
    "2003 ) have shown that large amplitude inov ( @xmath6 ) is displayed exclusively by blazars , i.e. , bl lacs and highly polarized quasars ( hpqs ) , such inov is generally expected to be primarily associated with the relativistic jet . yet , the precise mechanism of the inov remains obscure .",
    "the possibilities often invoked include perturbations in the inner jet , caused by shear or relativistic shocks , small - scale inhomogeneities in the magnetic field and instabilities in the particle acceleration , etc .",
    "( e.g. , wiita 1996 ; marscher 1996 and references therein ) . some contribution to inov can also be expected from accretion disk instabilities ( mangalam & wiita 1993 ) and , occasionally , from `` superluminal gravitational microlensing '' ( gopal - krishna & subramanian 1991 ; also , rabbette et al .",
    "1996 ; romero , surpi & vucetich .",
    "potential clues for assessing the relative importance of these various mechanisms may emerge by identifying and then studying in detail blazars exhibiting some highly unusual pattern of inov .    during the aries programme of optical monitoring of a sample of powerful agn",
    ", the well known rbl , pks 0735 + 178 , was found to exhibit remarkably low - level inov ( @xmath9 on all the 4 nights it was monitored during 1998 - 2001 ( sagar et al . 2004 ) . to probe this unexpected result , we have extended intranight monitoring of this rbl for a further seven years .",
    "this has yielded its intranight @xmath0-band differential light curves ( dlcs ) for a total of 17 nights , between 1998 and 2008 .",
    "thus , the dlcs are available for minimum one night every winter since 1998 , except for 2002 . each dlc is longer than @xmath1 hours and has a sensitivity adequate for a secure detection of inov down to @xmath10 level . in this paper , we report these new data and discuss our entire dataset in the broader context of the published multi - wavelength observations of this well known bl lac object .",
    "pks 0735 + 178 is among the first sources to be designated as `` classical bl lac '' ( carswell et al .",
    "its host galaxy still remains unresolved ( e.g. , pursimo et al . 2002 ) but an absorption feature in the optical spectrum , identified as mg - ii , has yielded a lower redshift limit of @xmath11 ( e.g. , rector & stocke 2001 ) .",
    "hartman et al . ( 1999 ) have reported @xmath12ray detection of this blazar using egret . on the basis of its spectral energy distribution peaking at @xmath13 hz",
    ", it can be confidently classified as a ` low energy peaked ' bl lac ( lbl ) ( padovani et al .",

    "the instrumental magnitudes of the blazar and the stars in the image frames were determined by aperture photometry , using daophot ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "the magnitudes of the blazar were measured relative to the nearby comparison stars present on the same ccd frame in order to account for the extinction of blazar s light due to the earth s atmosphere .",
    "this way , differential light curves ( dlcs ) of the blazar were generated relative to three comparison stars .",
    "likewise , dlcs were also generated for each comparison star relative to the other two comparison stars .",
    "for each night , the selection of the optimum aperture radius for photometry was done on the basis of the observed dispersions in the star - star dlcs generated using different aperture radii , starting from the median seeing ( fwhm ) value on that night to 4 times that value .",
    "the aperture selected was the one which showed minimum scatter for the steadiest dlc found for the various pairs of the comparison stars .",
    "the selected aperture radius was then used to generate dlcs for the target blazar relative to the comparison stars , as well as for the individual comparison stars , by pairing them with the remaining two comparison stars .",

    ", the optical flux recorded a peak - to - peak amplitude variation of slightly over 1.7 mag ( fig .",
    "3 ) . our data ( table 1 )",
    "provide a hint that the nights of inov detection coincide not with the extrema but with gradients in optical flux , consistent with the trend noted by webb et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and howard et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . however , we caution that such a correlation is weak , at best , since the inov detections were marginal .",
    "the key result from our observations is that not even on one of the 17 nights was the inov amplitude of this bl lac found to be @xmath74 , even though the probability of observing such inov amplitudes is known to be @xmath75 in any single monitoring session longer than @xmath1 hours , a condition that was well satisfied in our programme ( sect . 1 ; table 1 ) .",
    "the probability of our negative result arising purely by chance is vanishingly small @xmath76 .",
    "this suggests that pks 0735 + 178 has persisted in an inov quiescent state since 1998 , despite other indications of its returning to an active state during this period . as summarized in sect .",
    "4 , the indicators of renewed activity include ( a ) the large variation in its optical synchrotron flux on month / year - like time scale and ( b ) the return of its vlbi jet to the ` normal ' rectilinear shape .",
    "other indicators of a typical blazar state are the fairly high degrees of optical and radio polarization ( sect .",
    "4.3 ) and the persistence of its flat radio spectrum ( fig .",
    "1e ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a rather uncharacteristic behaviour is echoed by the fact that during the past two decades this blazar has undergone large radio outburst just once ( sect .",
    "4.2 ; also , hovatta et al .",
    "2007 ) and that too without a clear optical counterpart ( sect .",
    "furthermore , its x - ray/@xmath12ray emission has been fairly steady ( sect .",
    "1 ) .    here",
    "we note that recently from their 4-hour long @xmath0-band monitoring of this blazar on jan .",
    "11 , 2007 at yunnan observatory , gupta et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have reported an inov detection . however , since their published dlc ( fig .",
    "6 of their paper ) is essentially flat and contains no significant structure on hour - like time scale , the inov claimed by them can at best be of ` flicker ' type , with a time scale much shorter than the hour - like time scale we have considered here .    in order to augment the present study we now turn attention to the ( unpublished ) optical monitoring data reported in tables 3.1 and 4.1 of dr .",
    "john noble s phd dissertation ( 1995 ) . during jan .",
    "25 - 31 , 1992 he monitored pks 0735 + 178 on 6 nights in @xmath0-band , using the 1.07-metre lowell telescope . on 5 of the nights ,",
    "the monitoring duration was sufficiently long to meet our criterion ( 6.7 , 3.9 , 4.2 , 5.0 and 8.2 hours ) and so also was the sensitivity of the dlcs ( @xmath77 ) ( sect .",
    "remarkably , on just one of these five nights did the blazar show inov and that too with an amplitude of only @xmath78 ( table 4.1 ) .",
    "this trend of inov quiesence is further corroborated by noble s 5 hour long @xmath79-band monitoring of this blazar on march 17 , 1989 , using the kpno 0.9-metre telescope .",
    "again , no inov was detected , despite the high sensitivity attained ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "all these results place on a stronger footing the finding already emerging from our 17 nights monitoring during 1998 - 2008 ( table 1 ) , namely that this _ bona - fide _ radio selected bl lac is quite exceptional for its propensity to remain in a state of intranight optical quiescence ( i.e. , @xmath81 ) .",
    "here it needs to be emphasized that , unlike our optical observations over the period 1998 - 2008 , during which the radio flux of pks0735 + 178 was still at a comparatively low level ( despite a resumption in its optical activity ) , the afore - mentioned optical data of noble ( 1995 ) are actually contemporaneous to the historically strongest radio outburst ( fig .",
    "thus , while his march 1989 observations coincided with the first of the twin radio flares ( the historical maximum ) , his 5 nights monitoring during jan .",
    "1992 coincided with the onset of decline of the second peak of the twin radio flare ( fig .",
    "1c & d ) .",
    "* since substantial optical variability on wide ranging time scales , which is typical of blazars , is commonly associated with shocks forming and interacting with inhomogeneities in the doppler boosted synchrotron jets ( e.g. , marscher , gear & travis 1992 ) , it is tempting to ask if the prolonged uncharacteristically subdued inov level of the classical blazar pks 0735 + 178 is a manifestation of some unusual property of its jet .",
    "one model that explicitly attempts to address this question , particularly in the context of hour - like or shorter time scales of variability , invokes interaction of relativistic shocks in the jet with sub - parsec scale irregularities ( romero 1995 ) .",
    "this scenario has been developed specifically for the two - fluid model of agn jets originally proposed by sol et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , wherein an extremely light and narrow beam of relativistic pair - plasma responsible for the apparent superluminal motion in the nuclear jets , is enveloped by a wider jet comprised of a much denser non - relativistic electron - proton plasma which carries most of the kinetic energy and terminates in kiloparsec sized hot spots ( pelletier & roland 1989 ; henri & pelletier 1991 ) .",
    "it has been argued that sub - parsec scale irregularities ( needed for inov ) could arise in the beam of such jets due to classical macroscopic kelvin - helmholtz instabilties , in case the axial magnetic field in the beam , @xmath82 , is below a critical value @xmath83^{1/2}\\gamma^{-1}_{b } $ ] , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the electron number density and bulk lorentz factor of the beam , respectively and @xmath86 is the electron rest mass ( romero 1995 ) . applying this model to the case of the well studied intraday variable blazar 0917 + 624 , for which estimates of the beam s density and magnetic field are available",
    ", romero has shown that for a highly supersonic beam flow and equipartition magnetic fields , the ( fastest growing ) reflection modes would cross over into the unstable regime and a rapid transition to a turbulent jet would occur , yielding the basic setting for inov . although estimates for the basic physical parameters for the present lbl pks 0735 + 178 are not available , it is conceivable that its beam is fairly stable to the k - h instabilities ( i.e. , @xmath87 , see above ) .",
    "such a prospect is indeed supported by the polarimetric vlbi data revealing that the magnetic field in the nuclear jet of this lbl is predominently axial ( agudo et al . 2001 ) , unlike the norm for such bl lacs ( e.g. , lister & homan 2005 ; kharb , gabuzda & shastri 2008 ) .",
    "*    it is clear that in order to develop a proper understanding of the anomalous inov behaviour of pks 0735 + 178 , clues will have to be gleaned by relating its multi - band variability patterns ( of which some are distinctly typical of bl lacs , while the others are less so , see above ) to the vlbi imaging and polarimetry of its nuclear jet .",
    "the vlbi observations have already revealed enigmatic multiple twists in the nuclear jet which are transitory , like the superluminal motion of its radio knots ( sect .",
    "could the processes underlying this peculiar behaviour have kept the inner jet ( where inov presumably originates ) hidden from our view ? these aspects will be examined by us elsewhere ( * britzen et al .",
    "2009 , in prep . * ) , based on an available sequence of vlbi images of this blazar taken at more than 20 epochs over the past two decades .",
