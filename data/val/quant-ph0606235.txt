    "casimir s prediction for the force @xmath0 per unit area @xmath1 between two perfectly conducting infinite parallel plates at a distance @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath3 has a remarkable property : a straightforward dimensional analysis already fixes the powers of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath2 uniquely . in absence of any other dimensionful quantity ,",
    "the effects of quantum fluctuations in this geometry can be summarized by a simple number : @xmath6 .",
    "this coefficient is universal in the sense that it does not depend on the microscopic details of the interactions between the fluctuating field and the constituents of the surfaces .",
    "it is completely fixed by specifying the geometry , the nature of the fluctuating field and the type of boundary conditions .",
    "for instance , for a fluctuating real scalar field with dirichlet boundary conditions , the parallel - plate coefficient reduces exactly to @xmath7 ; the factor of 2 in eq .",
    "can be traced back to the two polarization modes of the electromagnetic field .    away from the ideal casimir limit , corrections to eq .",
    "arise from finite conductivity , surface roughness , thermal fluctuations and deviations from the ideal geometry .",
    "all these come with additional dimensionful scales , such as plasma frequency , length scales of roughness variation , temperature or surface - curvature radii .",
    "the corrections generically can not be predicted from dimensional analysis , but its functional dependence on the further parameters has to be computed @xcite .",
    "the present work is devoted to an investigation of the casimir force between disconnected rigid surfaces , which exhibits properties similar to casimir s classic parallel - plate configuration : unique dimensional scale dependencies and universal coefficients .",
    "the first property implies that the geometry is characterized by only one length scale , such as the distance parameter @xmath2 .",
    "new casimir configurations therefore necessarily involve edges , whose influence on the casimir effect is an interesting and difficult question in itself . in view of the rapid progress in the fabrication and use of micro- and nano - scale mechanical devices accompanied by precision measurements of the casimir forces in these systems @xcite ,",
    "a detailed understanding of casimir edge effects is indispensable .",
    "straightforward computations of casimir edge effects are conceptually complicated , since the fluctuation spectrum carries the relevant information in a subtle manner . a technique that facilitates casimir computations from first field - theoretic principles",
    "is given by _",
    "worldline numerics _",
    "@xcite , combining the string - inspired approach to quantum field theory @xcite with monte carlo methods . as a main advantage",
    ", the worldline algorithm can be formulated for arbitrary casimir geometries , resulting in a numerical estimate of the exact answer @xcite . since the approach is based on feynman path - integral techniques , the problem of determining the casimir fluctuation spectrum",
    "is circumvented @xcite .",
    "the resulting algorithms are trivially scalable , and computational efforts increase only linearly with the parameters of the numerics .",
    "recent results obtained by worldline numerics @xcite go hand in hand with those obtained by new analytical methods @xcite which are based on advanced scattering - theory techniques ; excellent agreement has been found for the experimentally important sphere - plate and cylinder - plate casimir configurations .    in the present work ,",
    "we use worldline numerics to examine casimir edge effects induced by a fluctuating scalar field , obeying dirichlet boundary conditions ( `` dirichlet scalar '' ) .",
    "we compute casimir interaction energies and forces between rigid surfaces .",
    "our results can directly be applied to casimir configurations in ultracold - gas systems @xcite where massless scalar fluctuations exist near the phase transition . for casimir configurations probing the electromagnetic fluctuation field ,",
    "the results for the universal coefficients may quantitatively differ , but our values can be used for an order - of - magnitude estimate of the error induced by edges of a finite configuration , thus providing an important ingredient for the data analysis of future experiments .",
    "in addition to being a simple and reliable quantitative method , the worldline formalism also offers an intuitive picture of quantum - fluctuation phenomena .",
    "the fluctuations are mapped onto closed gauian random paths ( worldlines ) which represent the spacetime trajectories of virtual loop processes .",
    "the casimir interaction energy between two surfaces can thus be obtained by identifying all worldlines that intersect both surfaces .",
    "these worldlines correspond to fluctuations that would violate the boundary conditions ; their removal from the ensemble of all possible fluctuations thereby contributes to the ( negative ) casimir interaction energy .",
    "the latter measures only that part of the energy that contributes to the force between rigid surfaces ; possibly divergent self - energies of the single surfaces @xcite are already removed .    for a massless dirichlet scalar ,",
    "the worldline representation of the casimir interaction energy reads @xcite @xmath8 \\right\\rangle_{\\mathbf x } .",
    "\\label{eq : ecasw}\\ ] ] the expectation value in has to be taken with respect to an ensemble of closed worldlines , @xmath9 with implicit normalization @xmath10 . in eq .",
    ", @xmath11=1 $ ] if a worldline @xmath12 intersects both surfaces @xmath13 , and @xmath11=0 $ ] otherwise .",
    "the worldline integral can also be evaluated locally , e.g. , with the restriction to worldlines with a common center of mass , @xmath14 , resulting in the interaction energy density @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the interaction energy serves as a potential for the casimir force between rigid surfaces ; the force is thus obtained by simple differentiation with respect to the distance parameters .",
    "the worldline numerical algorithm corresponds to a monte carlo evaluation of the path integral of eq .   with a discretized propertime @xmath17 . in this work",
    ", we exploit the recent algorithmic developments detailed in @xcite .",
    "let us first analyze a semi - infinite plate perpendicularly above an infinite plate at a minimal distance @xmath2 , as first proposed in @xcite .",
    "this configuration is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp ] together with a worldline which contributes to the casimir interaction energy , since it intersects both plates .     between the edge of the upper semi - infinite plate ( thick solid line ) and the lower infinite plate represents the only dimensionful length scale in the problem . ]",
    "this configuration is translationally invariant only in the direction pointing along the edge with @xmath2 being the only dimensionful length scale .",
    "the casimir force per unit length @xmath18 along the edge direction is thus unambiguously fixed by dimensional analysis , @xmath19 evaluating the worldline integral as outlined above , we obtain an estimate for the corresponding casimir interaction energy density @xmath20 , a contour plot of which is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : contourpp ] . for the universal coefficient , we obtain @xmath21 the error is below the 1% level for a path ensemble of 40  000 loops with 200  000 points per loop ( ppl ) each .",
    "this coefficient is in agreement with the casimir interaction energy computed in @xcite .     for the perpendicular - plate configuration .",
    "the white lines mark the position of the plates to guide the eye .",
    "ensemble parameters : 2000 loops with 10  000 ppl . ]",
    "next we consider a first variant of the parallel - plate configuration , where one of the plates is only semi - infinite with an edge on one side ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : hpp ] . this configuration can be viewed as an idealized limit of a real experimental situation where a smaller controllable finite plate is kept parallel above a larger fixed substrate .    .",
    "a worldline can intersect both plates even if its center of mass is located outside the two plates . ]    in this case , the dominant contribution to the force is given by the universal classic parallel - plate result of eq .",
    "with @xmath1 being the surface area of the smaller plate .    in the ideal limit of @xmath1 as well as",
    "the edge length @xmath18 going to infinity , the sub - leading casimir edge effect is also universal .",
    "dimensional analysis requires the exact force to be of the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the parallel - plate force for the dirichlet scalar , i.e. , without the factor 2 in eq .  .",
    "a priori , the universal coefficient @xmath24 can be positive or negative .",
    "the sign can easily be guessed within the worldline picture : owing to their spatial extent , a sizable fraction of worldlines can intersect both plates even if their center of mass is located outside the plates .",
    "this can quantitatively be verified by the energy density , the peak of which indeed extends into the outside region ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : contourphp ] .     for a semi - infinite plate parallel to an infinite plate .",
    "the white lines mark the position of the plates to guide the eye .",
    "the energy - density peak extends into the outside region , since worldlines can intersect both plates even if their center of mass is in the outside region .",
    "ensemble parameters : 1000 loops , 10  000 ppl . ]",
    "this peak in the outside region contributes to the total interaction energy , implying an increase of the casimir force compared to the pure parallel - plate formula .",
    "therefore , the casimir edge effect leads to further attraction , and the sign of the universal coefficient @xmath24 must be positive .",
    "quantitatively , we find @xmath25 again with 40  000 loops , 200  000 ppl .      another variant of the parallel - plate configuration is given by two parallel semi - infinite plates with parallel edges ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : hphp ] .",
    "this configuration corresponds to an idealized parallel - plate experiment where both plates have the same area size @xmath1 .    .",
    "]    in the ideal limit of infinite @xmath1 as well as infinite edge length @xmath18 , the exact form of the force is again given by dimensional analysis , @xmath26 equivalent to eq .  .",
    "qualitatively , the situation is similar to the preceding one with one semi - infinite plate .",
    "quantitatively , fewer worldlines in the outside as well as the inside region near the edge intersect both plates .",
    "both aspects are visible in the plot of the interaction energy density in fig .",
    "[ fig : contourhphp ] : the peak height and width is reduced near the edge both inside and outside the plates .     for two parallel semi - infinite plates .",
    "the energy - density peak extends into the outside region , since worldlines can intersect both plates even if their center of mass is in the outside region .",
    "ensemble parameters : 2000 loops , 10  000 ppl . ]",
    "we still observe a positive universal coefficient , @xmath27 ( 93  000 loops , 500  000 ppl ) , which is a bit less than half as big as the preceding case with one semi - infinite plate .",
    "again , the casimir edge effect increases the force in comparison with the pure parallel - plate estimate @xmath23 .",
    "the universal results for the idealized configurations presented above can immediately be used to derive estimated predictions for further casimir configurations .      replicating the perpendicular - plate configuration in the horizontal direction of figs .",
    "[ fig : pp ] and [ fig : contourpp ] , we obtain a stack of semi - infinite plates ( a `` casimir comb '' ) perpendicularly above an infinite plate .",
    "let @xmath28 be the distance between two neighboring semi - infinite plates , i.e. , the distance between two teeth of the comb . in the limit @xmath29 , we obtain the casimir force between the casimir comb and the infinite plate by simply adding the forces for the individual perpendicular plates .",
    "the reliability of this approximation is obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig : contourpp ] , which shows that the dominant contribution to the energy is peaked inside a region with length scale @xmath30 .",
    "the resulting force is @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the total area of a comb with @xmath33 teeth . for a fixed comb ,",
    "i.e. , fixed @xmath28 , the short - distance casimir force thus has a weaker dependence on @xmath2 than for the parallel - plate case . in the opposite limit @xmath34",
    ", we expect the force between the comb and the plate to rapidly approach that of the parallel - plate case .",
    "this is because a generic worldline contributing to the force will have a spatial extent of order @xmath2 , such that the finer comb scale @xmath34 will not be resolved by the worldline ensemble to first approximation .",
    "a similar observation has been made in studies of periodic corrugations @xcite .      in a real parallel - plate experiment ,",
    "the finite extent of the plates induces edge effects .",
    "if the typical length scale @xmath18 of a plate ( such as the edge length of a square plate or the radius of a circular disc ) is much larger than the plate distance @xmath2 , our results for the idealized limits studied above can be used within a good approximation .",
    "the force law can then be summarized as @xmath35 where the effective area @xmath36 also carries the information about the edge effects . for the case of a smaller plate with area @xmath1 and circumference @xmath37 above a much larger substrate ,",
    "the effective area is given by @xmath38 e.g. , @xmath39 for a square plate with edge length @xmath18 .",
    "for the case of two parallel plates of equal size and shape with area @xmath1 and circumference @xmath37 , eq .   holds with @xmath24 replaced by @xmath40 . obviously , the effective area @xmath36 is larger than the physical area in either case .",
    "consider , for instance , a square plate of edge length @xmath18 above a larger substrate : the casimir edge effects induce a correction on the 1% level if @xmath41% of @xmath18 . in the experiment of reference @xcite ,",
    "the edge length is @xmath42 and the distance goes up to @xmath43 .",
    "one of the edges faces an edge of the substrate , similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : hphp ] , whereas the other three correspond to fig .",
    "[ fig : hpp ] . for the dirichlet scalar",
    "this results in a correction of 0.2% , which is much smaller than the 15% precision level of the experiment .",
    "we have performed a detailed quantitative study of casimir edge effects induced by a fluctuating scalar field obeying dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "all of our results exhibit a uniquely fixed dependence on dimensionful scales , as for casimir s classic result . the effect of quantum fluctuations is quantitatively encoded in a universal dimensionless coefficient , which only depends on the geometry , the nature of the fluctuating field and the boundary conditions . from the perspective of a scattering - theory approach , casimir edge effects are dominated by diffractive contributions to the correlation functions which are difficult to handle for direct approximation techniques @xcite ; hence , our results give an important first insight into the properties of diffractive contributions to casimir forces . for casimir measurements involving electromagnetic fluctuations ,",
    "our results serve as a first order - of - magnitude estimate of the error induced by edges of finite configurations ",
    "an error that any parallel - plate experiment has to deal with .",
