    "@xcite all supersymmetric masses have been identified .",
    "furthermore , some of the technical difficulties in connection to the interplay of dimensional reduction ( dred ) and supersymmetry have been addressed in this reference . in this context",
    "it has been very useful to evaluate the qcd corrections within dred and check that the proper renormalization of the evanescent couplings leads to the known analytical expressions after re - expressing the strong dred coupling by its counterpart in dimensional regularization ( dreg ) . in this paper we build on the developed formalism and evaluate the higgs - gluon coupling for various hierarchies which are of phenomenological relevance . in particular , we provide the counterterms of the evanescent couplings which could be relevant also for other calculations .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in the next section we briefly review the formalism and discuss the subtleties at nlo ( where an exact calculation has been performed ) and nnlo .",

    "the first one contains all contributions where the external higgs boson couples to a top quark or top squark ( see fig .  [ fig::diags1 ] for sample diagrams ) whereas all diagrams with a coupling of the higgs boson to a super partner of the five lighter quark flavours constitute the second class ( see fig .",
    "[ fig::diags2 ] ) .",

    "we consider all squarks except the top squark to be degenerate and we furthermore assume that the corresponding quarks are massless .",
    "thus the squark contributions from the first two families cancel and only the contribution from bottom squarks remains . in the following",
    "we nevertheless use the notion `` squark contribution '' for diagrams from fig .",
    "[ fig::diags2 ] .    in this paper",
    "we compute all contributions from the top quark / top squark and light quark / squark sector in the limit of vanishing light quark masses up to three loops . for the corresponding feynman rules we refer to the appendices of refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",

    "will be included in our numerical prediction up to nlo  @xcite as we will describe in section  [ sub::form ] .    since @xmath15 constitutes the effective higgs - gluon coupling it is sufficient to evaluate the corresponding feynman integrals in the limit of vanishing external momenta",
    "this is conveniently achieved by applying a projector ( see , e.g. , eqs .  ( 11 ) and  ( 12 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) on one of the two tensor structures and by performing a naive taylor expansion afterwards . as a result one ends up with vacuum integrals involving several mass scales in the case of supersymmetry .",
    "up to two - loop order such integrals can be computed exactly , the corresponding algorithm and necessary formulae have been provided in ref .  @xcite almost 20  years ago .",
    "since an analogue algorithm at three - loop order is not available to date one has to rely on special cases combined with expansions in order to construct approximations to the exact formulae .",

    "however , we first discuss in the next subsection the renormalization procedure .      besides the technical difficulties , which are described in subsection  [ sub::appr ] , also several field theoretic challenges have to be solved .",
    "they are mainly connected to the fact that for the calculation of @xmath15 it is convenient to use dred  @xcite whereas the calculations within the effective theory of eq .",
    "( [ eq::leff ] ) are performed with the help of dreg .",
    "the lo calculation is not affected by this issue . also at nlo",
    "it is possible to proceed in a naive way . at nnlo , however , it is necessary to properly renormalize all occurring parameters and to use the relations between their dred and dreg definition . in ref .",

    "we renormalize all parameters in the @xmath34 scheme except @xmath35 and the coupling of the higgs boson to @xmath22 scalars .",
    "@xmath35 is renormalized on - shell with the condition @xmath36 .",
    "note that we take this limit only in the final result since in intermediate steps @xmath37 terms occur which have to be canceled by proper counterterms .",
    "the two - loop @xmath34 counterterms for @xmath38 and @xmath39 are independent of all occurring scales and can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also references therein ) . due to the quadratic divergence",
    "the renormalization constants for the squark masses and the mixing angle @xmath40 , which we also need up to two loops , depend on mass ratios which is known exactly , even up to three loops  @xcite .",
    "the gluino mass counterterm is only needed to one - loop order .",
    "as far as wave function renormalization of external particles is concerned only the one for the external gluons contributes .",
    "actually , for our calculation only those contributions to the gluon two - point function have to be considered which contain heavy particles .",
    "this is conveniently formulated in terms of a bare decoupling constant of the gluon field  @xcite which is usually denoted by @xmath41 .",

    "it becomes clear that the @xmath78 terms could be avoided if a matching to an effective lagrangian defined within dred would be performed .",
    "however , in that case it is likely that more operators have to be considered in the effective lagrangian which have not yet been studied in the literature .",
    "alternatively the calculations could probably also be performed in the limit where @xmath35 is the largest scale .",

    "however , in case one of the top squarks becomes of the order of a few hundred gev the supersymmetric corrections to the matching coefficient @xmath16 are not negligible any more and a sizeable effect on the production cross section is noticeable . for the scenarios considered in this paper a reduction of the nnlo prediction of the cross section by a few percent",

    "we also want to stress that visible effects result from separating the soft and hard scale in @xmath16 which automatically resums potentially large logarithms involving the higgs boson mass .    in order to perform the numerical evaluation",

    "<S> we compute the total cross section for the production of a light cp even higgs boson within the framework of supersymmetric qcd up to next - to - next - to - leading order . </S>",
    "<S> technical subtleties in connection to the evaluation of three - loop feynman integrals with many mass scales are discussed in detail and explicit results for the counterterms of the evanescent couplings are provided . </S>",
    "<S> the new results are applied to several phenomenological scenarios which are in accordance with the recent discovery at the lhc . in a large part of the still allowed parameter space the @xmath0 factor of the supersymmetric theory is close to the one of the standard model . however , for the case where one of the top squarks is light , a deviation of more than 5% in the next - to - next - to - leading order prediction of the cross section can be observed where at the same time the predicted higgs boson mass has a value of about 125  gev .    </S>",
