    "until a few years ago , observational measurement of supernova ( sn ) rates were scanty .",
    "the only available measurements were those for local sn rates @xcite whilst nothing was known about the evolution with look - back time .",
    "the turning point was represented in the late nineties by the demonstration that type ia sne can be used as precise distance indicators , particularly well suited to probe the geometry of universe @xcite .",
    "the striking result that the universe is accelerating has indeed stimulated the kick off of several new sn search projects , aimed at using type ia sne as cosmological probes both to improve the determinations of the density parameters @xmath0 as well as to trace the evolution of the expansion factor through the universe history ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) . before that time , studies of sn rates and their evolution with redshift were mainly theoretical speculations . today , the few published measurement are based on data from sn searches designed for cosmological purposes @xcite . the only exception is represented by @xcite , a unique sn search specifically designed to measure the sn rate at intermediate redshifts and with no bias towards ia s",
    ".    a major point of concern when deriving observational estimates of sn rates is the correction for all possible biases affecting the observed number counts .",
    "nowadays , the main source of bias is caused by the effect of dust extinction in the sn host galaxies .",
    "this is indeed severe , particularly for core collapse ( cc ) sne , which are preferentially located in dust - rich environments . on the contrary ,",
    "the effect for type ia sne is usually assumed to be milder , particularly for those exploding in elliptical and early spiral galaxies , which are thought to be almost dust - free environments ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , there are several examples of type ia sne spanning a large range of extinction from moderate to high values : e.g. sn  1994d @xmath1 mag @xcite , sn  2002er @xmath2 mag @xcite , sn  2002bo @xmath3 mag @xcite , sn  2003cg @xmath4 mag ( elias de la rosa , private communication ) and sn  2002cv @xmath5 mag @xcite .",
    "there are several methods to estimate the amount of extinction suffered by a sn : they require either the availability of the sn light curve ( lc ) in at least two passbands ( around maximum light or between 30 and 90 days past b maximum light ) or at least one spectrum with good s / n ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "* for an application ) .",
    "these techniques are nevertheless useless when one needs to estimate the bias introduced by host galaxy extinction on a sample of sne discovered by a search program .",
    "indeed in such a case , the valuable missing piece of information is a statistical correction factor that would include , in the sn number counts , the contribution of those objects that were extinguished by the dust of their parent galaxy and consequently weakened below the search detection limit .    so far the only work aimed at studying the effect of extinction on the radial distributions of sn properties in their parent galaxy is represented by the model of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter hbd98 ) .",
    "using a monte carlo approach based on assumed distributions of dust and sn populations , they derived the expected extinction distributions and projected radial distributions of both type ia and cc sne . in particular , they adopted a simple description of the dust distribution from which they derived the total @xmath6-band extinction per kpc in the plane of the disk , @xmath7 , which is a linear function of @xmath8 ( see eq . 1 and 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "in such a parametrisation , the dust density rises from zero in the centre of the model to a maximum value at 5 kpc and then falls to zero at 17.5 kpc .",
    "they found that as the galaxy inclination increases , the projected distribution s peak moves toward the central regions .",
    "moreover , they conclude that the effects of extinction induced by the host galaxy are likely to be the cause of the observed difference in absolute magnitude dispersion of type ia sne within and beyond 7.5 kpc , confirming the findings of @xcite .    despite the obvious interest in the observed spatial dependence of sne properties , in this work",
    "we will rather focus on deriving a recipe to correct the observed sn rate for host galaxy extinction .",
    "the hbd98 model has been used to derive extinction corrections for both local @xcite and high-@xmath9 @xcite sn rates .",
    "in particular , @xcite have carefully tested the hbd98 approach to derive the extinction corrections as a function of galaxy inclination .",
    "interestingly enough , they found that the model appears to overcorrect the sn rate of distant galaxies suggesting that a more detailed modelling of the dust distribution and properties is possibly required .",
    "all modern measurement of sn rates at high-@xmath9 currently available have either not been corrected for dust extinction @xcite or were corrected @xcite using the hbd98 approach .    for these reasons , and given the importance of this topic in modern astrophysics , we have decided to address the problem with a more detailed approach .",
    "our final goal is to construct a reliable model which is able to provide the `` bias factor '' needed to correct the observed sn rates for dust extinction . in this framework",
    ", we started from the monte carlo approach of hbd98 , which clearly has proven to be effective , and tried to construct a more general model able to cope with the variety of dust properties and distributions that are observed in different spiral galaxies .",
    "this is indeed a key feature to enable a reliable determination of the dust bias factor for a real sn search , where the galaxy sample is clearly a mixture of types and morphologies .",
    "recently @xcite developed some models for extinction of type ia sne due to dust in spiral galaxies .",
    "the main purpose of his work is attempting to account for observational effects that play a significant role in searches for high redshift type ia sne .",
    "in particular , that paper investigates the expected dependence of the observed amount of extinction in high redshift type ia sne rather than trying to quantify the effect of dust extinction on the measured sn rates . in this respect",
    ", we feel that the study of @xcite and the present work are complementary .",
    "nevertheless we will discuss the main differences between our model and commins s one in section [ par : method ] .",
    "in this paper we present the model and the general recipe to derive the extinction correction factor while the application to the computation of extinction - corrected sn rates will be discussed in a companion paper . in section [ par : method ] we outline the model and the assumed spatial distributions of dust and sne . section [ par : parspace ] presents model predictions of the extinction distributions and projected radial distributions together with their dependence on model parameters . as an illustration we show the effects of dust for a single test case in section [ par : app ] .",
    "section [ par : discussion ] presents a discussion of the physical parameters which have a major impact on the extinction correction factor .",
    "finally we summarise our results in section [ par : end ] .",
    "the method we follow in this work is based on the monte carlo technique and it consists of a few basic steps grouped in two main stages : the monte carlo and the integration part . in the first stage type ia sn positions",
    "inside host galaxies are generated according to different distribution functions ( see sec .",
    "[ par : sndists ] ) .",
    "after that , random sn phases and lines of sight are uniformly and isotropically generated , respectively .",
    "these steps complete the monte carlo stage of the simulation .",
    "the integration stage uses the monte carlo data to compute the sn magnitudes .",
    "first the total column density along the line of sight associated to each object is computed by integrating the dust density function ( see sec .",
    "[ dust ] ) along the specific line - of - sight . finally , the apparent magnitudes of sne are computed integrating template sn spectra , redshifted to the suitable redshift @xmath9 , over the selected passband @xmath10 in the presence , or absence , of dust absorption using draine s extinction laws @xcite ( see sec .",
    "[ snmag ] ) . in this way",
    "we can study how the distribution of sn extinction depends on different geometries ( e.g. galaxy inclination , different sn distributions inside the host galaxy , etc . ) and different physical parameters ( e.g. face - on central optical depth , etc . ) . in this work",
    "we have always used draine s extinction law for @xmath11 but the model implementation considers also the cases @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in principle , any another extinction law for which the extinction coefficients as a function of wavelength are provided is suitable as well .",
    "we note that , from the analysis of individual sne , in some cases values of @xmath14 have been found as low as 2.0 ( elias de la rosa , private communication ) .",
    "though the approach we used is general , we decided to limit our discussion only to type ia sne both because of the lack of enough data ( lc and spectra ) for each cc sne type ( ib , ic , iip , iil , etc . ) and because of the present great interest in type ia sne due to their cosmological applications .    throughout this paper",
    "we will assume the standard cosmological model ( @xmath15 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) .",
    "the adopted values for the other parameters will be discussed in the following sections .      it is generally accepted that type ia sne originate from the thermonuclear explosion of accreting white dwarfs ( wd ) in binary systems .",
    "the debate on the nature of the progenitor systems is still active .",
    "in particular there are two main scenarios : ( 1 ) the _ single degenerate _",
    ", in which the progenitor wd accretes hydrogen - rich matter via mass transfer from a companion main sequence or low mass rgb star @xcite ; ( 2 ) the _ double degenerate _ , in which the binary system is composed of two wds , the exploding wd reaches the chandrasekhar limit and explosive carbon ignition occurs at its centre @xcite .",
    "it thus seems reasonable to assume that the old galaxy stellar component is a good tracer of the type ia sne spatial distribution .",
    "the stellar component in a spiral galaxy can be described by two structures : a spheroidal bulge and a disk . to model these two components",
    ", we mainly followed the method employed in radiative transfer codes used to derive extinction and polarization effects in dusty spiral galaxies , ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we hence used the luminosity density distributions for the two galaxy components to describe the spatial number density of type ia sne , which we will denote as @xmath19 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to reproduce the variety of spiral hubble types , we have considered different bulge - to - total luminosity ratios @xmath20 in the range 0 ( resembling an sd galaxy ) to 0.5 ( resembling an sa )",
    ". given the parallelism between the luminosity distribution and the type ia sn spatial distribution previously introduced , once the total number , @xmath21 of simulated type ia sne has been fixed , a fraction @xmath22 is generated according to the bulge distribution and the remaining fraction @xmath23 is generated according to the disk distribution .",
    "we note that the properties of the assumed spatial distribution of type ia sne are among the most important parameters of our model .",
    "although the adopted spatial distribution is rather simple , it takes into account the diffent scale height of dust and sne suggested by the observations @xcite .",
    "a more detailed treatment of the differences between the distribution of the stellar component and type ia sne could improve the model but requires a careful analysis of the differences in the distributions between single stars and primordial binaries which is beyond the scope of the present study .      for the bulge ,",
    "following @xcite , we adopt a jaffe distribution @xcite : @xmath24 ^ 2}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the physical distance from the galactic centre and @xmath25 is the scale radius .",
    "the volume integral of the jaffe distribution converges for @xmath26 but clearly , for numerical reasons , we need to introduce a truncation radius @xmath27 . without this truncation , at large radii the number of bulge sne would indeed dominate once again that of the disk . in this work we used @xmath28 for the bulge scale - length and @xmath29 for the truncation radius .",
    "this value of @xmath25 , which corresponds to an equivalent radius @xmath30 , is close to the one inferred for our galaxy @xcite .      as for the bulge",
    ", we assume that the spatial distribution of stars in the disk is traced by the luminosity density . as a first approximation we can consider a double exponential law @xcite , namely @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath9 are the cylindrical coordinates , @xmath33 is the disk scale - length and @xmath34 the disk scale - height .",
    "following the same approach as in the bulge case , we introduce a radial , @xmath35 , and a vertical , @xmath36 , external truncation . in this work we used @xmath37 kpc and @xmath38 kpc which are similar to the values inferred for the old disk population of the galaxy . for the outer edge truncation we adopted @xmath39 @xcite .      as the aim of this work is to improve the calculation of the statistical properties of type ia sne extinction by host galaxy dust , it is crucial to simulate their spatial distribution inside the galaxy as realistically as possible . in particular , in their study",
    ", @xcite considered a sample of 35 spectroscopically identified type ia sne and measured their positions relative to the spiral arms from a homogeneous data set of @xmath40 and @xmath41 images .",
    "interestingly enough , they found that type ia sne occur closer to the arms than a perfectly randomised disk population .",
    "however , they note that type ia sne are not statistically distinguishable from the distribution of stellar light around the arms ( which should be considered as a tracer of the stellar density ) .",
    "we decided thus to implement in our model both cases : ( 1 ) no concentration closer to arms , which we achieve by distributing the sne in a homogeneous exponential disk ( eq . [ eq : plaindisk ] ) ; ( 2 ) concentration closer to arms , which we achieve by simulating a spiral structure as a perturbation of a homogeneous exponential disk .",
    "a realistic spiral structure can be represented by logarithmic spiral arms @xcite as a perturbation on a plain exponential disk . following @xcite , for the perturbed distribution we adopt the following expression : @xmath42 \\label{eq : spiraldisk}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the cylindrical coordinates .",
    "@xmath45 is made up of two components : the plain exponential disk @xmath46 , given by eq .",
    "[ eq : plaindisk ] , and the spiral perturbation represented by the term in square brackets .",
    "the three parameters governing the spiral perturbation are : @xmath47 , the spiral perturbation amplitude parameter ( @xmath48 correspond to the plain exponential disk ) ; @xmath49 , the pitch angle ( low @xmath49 values produce tightly wound arms ) and @xmath50 , the number of spiral arms .    though we have implemented in our model the perturbed spiral distribution described by eq .",
    "[ eq : spiraldisk ] , all the results discussed in this work are based on simulations in which the disk component was described by eq .",
    "[ eq : plaindisk ] .",
    "we believe indeed that , though the evidences presented by @xcite appear quite convincing , observational data is still too scanty to permit modelling without `` blind '' assumptions .",
    "we thus prefer to limit the study to the simpler case to reduce the number of low - impact model s free parameters .",
    "+      the exponential disk is commonly used in radiative transfer monte carlo codes of galaxies because it is easily implemented numerically and , moreover , it makes simulations very efficient in terms of computation time . in our approach",
    "we do not solve for the radiation transfer and thus we can implement more realistic dust distributions including a spiral arm structure , still keeping an affordable computation time . the dust density distribution @xmath51 is described by an expression analogous to eq .",
    "[ eq : spiraldisk ] , where the choice of the spiral perturbation parameters ( @xmath50 , @xmath49 and @xmath47 ) and the plain disk scale length and height ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 , analogous to @xmath33 and @xmath54 in eq .",
    "[ eq : plaindisk ] ) are obviously independent from that used for type ia sne distribution . in analogy with the type ia sne case ,",
    "we have introduced a radial , @xmath55 , and a vertical , @xmath56 , external truncation . in this work",
    "we adopt @xmath57 kpc and @xmath58 kpc and the same truncation factors as for the type ia sn distribution ( see sec .",
    "[ expdisk ] ) .",
    "the total content of dust in a galaxy is then normalised in terms of the optical depth along the galaxy symmetry axis : @xmath59 \\label{eq : dustnorm}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the disk vertical external truncation introduced before and the subscript @xmath10 indicates that the normalisation depends on the adopted passband , which is characterised by the value of the extinction coefficient at its effective wavelength @xmath61 .",
    "once @xmath62 has been fixed , eq .",
    "[ eq : dustnorm ] provides the normalisation @xmath63 for the dust distribution .",
    "[ eq : dustnorm ] is rigourously valid for the plain disk only , but it has been used also for the perturbed exponential disk because , in such case , the normalisation has not an analytical expression .",
    "we note here that hbd98 did not allow the dust density to increase to the very centre of the galaxy .",
    "conversely our models do not adopt any internal cut - off in the dust distribution .",
    "it appears that the central hole is a well know feature of the milky way dust distribution @xcite .",
    "we note however that usually such a central cut - off is not adopted by modern radiative transfer models used to fit the optical and near infrared surface brightness of observed galaxies .",
    "therefore , for the lack of compelling evidence to the contrary and for the sake of generality , we assume a smooth dust distribution without a central cut - off as described above . this difference may partially justify some of the diversities we found between our results and hbd98 s ones ( see section [ par : extinc ] ) .      to compute the sn apparent magnitudes one can follow two different approaches , one based on sn light curve and the other based on sn spectra . in the first approach one has to select a particular sn light curve template , thus choosing a particular @xmath64 parameter ( defined as the @xmath6 band magnitude difference between maximum light and 15 days after ) .",
    "other parameters are the absolute magnitude at maximum , its intrinsic dispersion and the @xmath65-correction which depends on redshift , filter and sn type and phase .",
    "finally one has to derive the total extinction along the line of sight and in the selected passband .",
    "in the second approach , which we choose to follow , one has to select a set of template spectra , covering a reasonable phase range .",
    "then , for a given sn phase , the spectrum is extinguished according to the total optical depth along the line of sight , and integrated over the passband @xmath10 to derive the apparent flux @xmath66 : @xmath67 } \\mathcal{t}_{\\mathcal{p}}(\\lambda)\\,d\\lambda } } { \\displaystyle \\int_{0}^{+\\infty } { \\mathcal{t}_{\\mathcal{p}}(\\lambda)\\,d\\lambda } } \\label{eq : specmag}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the ( input ) observed sn spectrum , @xmath69 is the extinction cross section per h nucleon @xmath70 as a function of wavelength for a given value of @xmath14 ( see sec .",
    "[ drainecext ] ) , @xmath71 is the total transmission for the passband @xmath10 and @xmath72 is the column density obtained by computing the integral of the dust density function along the line of sight .",
    "the apparent magnitude of the sn is finally computed converting the flux to magnitudes and applying the photometric zero point @xmath73 , namely : @xmath74 } -\\log{\\left(zp_\\mathcal{p}\\right ) } \\right\\ } \\label{eq : snmag}\\ ] ] in this work , we considered only the @xmath40 passband @xcite with a zero point @xmath75 erg  s@xmath16  @xmath76  @xmath16 but the approach is absolutely general .    to compute the sn apparent magnitude from eq .",
    "[ eq : snmag ] one needs the sn spectrum at a random phase @xmath44 to compute the sn flux through eq .",
    "[ eq : specmag ] .",
    "the problem is clearly that , even in the best cases , sn spectral sequences have a minimum separation of 1 day ( and even larger , particularly at later phases ) .",
    "the approach we adopted is to create a look - up table which enable one to construct an interpolated spectrum at any phase in the range spanned by the original input spectra , so that dangerous extrapolations are avoided .",
    "this procedure is described in the next section .",
    "the sn spectral library we used is composed by 28 spectra of sn 1998aq @xcite , merged with some data from sn 1994d @xcite and sn 1992a @xcite spanning the phase range @xmath77 days from maximum light .",
    "this was possible because these three objects are all `` normal '' , very similar , type ia sne . with the aim of increasing the generality of our approach",
    ", we devised a recipe that enables the use of a composite spectral library , i.e. a collection of spectra from different objects .",
    "one important fact to keep in mind is that dust extinction is a local process , i.e. it is working at the sn rest frame .",
    "all input spectra are first corrected to redshift z=0 ( i.e. the sn rest frame ) , trimmed to the overlapping wavelength range and re - binned to a common wavelength step @xmath78 .",
    "the last two operations have the only purpose of making the model implementation easier .",
    "the next step is to ensure the consistency of the spectrophotometry with the lc : for each spectrum ( i.e. phase ) a flux normalisation is computed in the selected passband @xmath10 , which ensures that the magnitude obtained from the spectrum ( through eqs .",
    "[ eq : specmag ] and [ eq : snmag ] ) is equal to the one derived from the sn lc template .    when computing the apparent flux @xmath66 using eq . [ eq : specmag ] , the spectrum is first extinguished and then redshifted to @xmath79 , the redshift at which the simulation is focused .",
    "we note that , within this approach , the usable phase range is given by the intersection of the light curve template and the spectral library ones .",
    "in particular , in this work the simulation phase range ( in the observer s rest frame ) is : @xmath80 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have developed a carbonaceous - silicate grain model which successfully reproduces observed interstellar extinction , scattering , and infrared emission for the milky way . in his review , @xcite ,",
    "discussed the available evidence for dust extinction per unit h column density in regions with different extinction curves .",
    "based on this discussion , he has renormalized the size distributions of @xcite .    in this work we used the extinction cross - sections per unit h nucleon @xmath82 for @xmath11 , which is considered to be appropriate for the typical diffuse hi clouds in the milky way .",
    "the model can be used as well with the extinction cross - sections computed for @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",

    "the thin lines show the distributions of @xmath83 ( bottom panel ) , @xmath84 ( middle panel ) and @xmath85 ( top panel ) whilst the thick lines show the distributions of @xmath86 ( bottom panel ) , @xmath87 ( middle panel ) and @xmath88 ( top panel ) .",
    "all distributions have a bin size of @xmath89 mag.,width=317 ]    we performed a simple test to quantify the impact the choice of one dust geometry with respect to another has on the observed sn magnitudes .",
    "we run one monte carlo simulation of @xmath90 sn positions and line of sights for a galaxy with @xmath91 ( the only model free parameter affecting the distribution of type ia sne ) .",
    "we then computed the observed sn magnitudes for each of the five dust geometries summarised in table [ dustpars ] adopting @xmath92 . in this way ,",
    "sn positions are the same in each simulation and thus their magnitudes obtained in each dust geometry can be directly compared . in particular , we show in figure [ dustgeo ] the magnitude difference @xmath93 between : the plain disk dust distribution s0 and each of the two spiral arms ones ( s21 , s22 ; bottom panel ) ; the plain disk dust distribution s0 and each of the three spiral arms one ( s31 , s32 ; middle panel ) ; each of the two spiral arms dust distributions and the corresponding three spiral arms ones ( upper panel ) . from this test",
    "we can conclude that :    * in each of the four cases shown in the bottom and middle panels of fig . [ dustgeo ] , the effect introduced by the spiral perturbation of the dust disk with respect to the plain disk case on the observed magnitudes is negligible for a fraction of sne which goes from a minimum of @xmath94 ( when the s22 geometry is considered ) , to a maximum of @xmath95 ( when the s31 geometry is considered ) , being @xmath96 mag . *",
    "the fraction of sne with @xmath97 mag , i.e. those showing a significant magnitude difference , is larger for the extreme spiral cases ( s22 , s32 ) than for the `` normal '' spiral cases ( s21 , s31 ) .",
    "moreover the difference between the plain dust disk and the spiral perturbed one is always larger in the two - arms cases with respect to the corresponding three - arms ones .",
    "the figures are shown in table [ tab : spiral ] .",
    "finally , the fraction of sne with @xmath98 mag is lower then 1% in all the cases .",
    "to exemplify how our model can be used to derive the extinction correction factor , we will analyse a single and simple test case .",
    "in particular , we will consider an ideal sn search whose galaxy sample is made of objects of the same type , at the same distance and with the same properties ( @xmath14 , @xmath99 , @xmath22 and dust geometry ) .",
    "this is almost equivalent to consider a real sn search targeted on a galaxy cluster for which the calculation of the correction factor is restricted to a single galaxy morphological class .",
    "it seems indeed plausible that for next future sn searches the statistics will no longer be a limitation and hence the computation of the sn rates in different galaxy types will become feasible .",
    "we thus run a simulation of @xmath100 type ia sne in a galaxy with @xmath92 , @xmath91 at redshift @xmath101 and with the dust geometry we labelled s21 ( see tab . [ modpars ] ) .",
    "it is obvious that the effect of host extinction is to reduce the observed sn number counts and thus the derived sn rates will be only a lower limit if no correction is applied . to compute the sn rate extinction correction factor @xmath102 from our simulation data we just need the intrinsic magnitude distribution @xmath103 and the extinguished magnitude distribution @xmath104 .",
    "then , @xmath102 will be simply given by the following relation : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the sn search detection efficiency function ( see below ) and the integrals are extended over the magnitude range defined by the bright end of the magnitude distribution @xmath107 and the faintest magnitude for which the efficiency function is not null @xmath108 .",
    "extinction corrected sn rates are eventually obtained simply multiplying the uncorrected rates by the correction factor @xmath102 .",
    "the sn detection efficiency function , @xmath106 , provides the sensitivity of the sn search as a function of the sn candidate s magnitude . the detection efficiency as a function of sn magnitude is usually a complicated function of many parameters , like the quality of the subtracted images ( seeing , transmission ) and the technique ( convolution , selection criteria ) used to extract the sn candidates .",
    "the efficiency function is usually determined through monte carlo simulations in which a number of artificial sne are positioned on the search images ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these synthetic images are then processed with the same software used to perform the search on the real images and the fraction of recovered  over  injected artificial sne , @xmath109 , is determined . in this work we used one of the efficiency curves of @xcite for a seeing of @xmath110",
    "re - scaled to an exposure time of 600 sec , which is a reasonable value for a @xmath101 sn search performed with a 2m - class telescope ( as in the case of * ? ? ?",
    "we note that the effect of exposure time on the efficiency curve is equivalent to a rigid shift of the magnitude scale .    as an example , we have applied the method described at the beginning of the section .",

    "the spike and wiggles at @xmath114 are mainly due to the fact that in this simulation we used only one specific type ia lc .",
    "we expect them to smooth out when type ia sn diversity is taken into account by combining simulation with different sn properties . from our calculation",
    "we find @xmath115 , i.e. @xmath116 of sne are not detected by the search because of host galaxy extinction .",
    "given the impressive size of the tail of the @xmath112 in fig .",
    "[ magdist ] , it is interesting to look at the intrinsic fraction ( without taking into account the efficiency curve ) of sne that are extinguished beyond the fainter magnitude reached in the absence of extinction ( @xmath117 in the case shown in fig .

    "the recipe described above to derive the correction factor @xmath102 clearly depends on the model parameters . to assess their importance on the final result we performed several simulations to probe its dependence from : ( 1 ) dust geometry , ( 2 ) size of the bulge , ( 3 ) dust content and ( 4 ) dust type .",

    "the effect of dust over- and under - densities therefore cancels out .",
    "conversely we expect that the dust distribution will play a more significant role for cc sne because they are also more concentrated in the spiral arms .",
    "we computed the correction factor for @xmath119 using dust model s21 with @xmath92 and @xmath11 .",
    "we found that the corresponding range spanned by the extinction correction factor is @xmath120 .",
    "hence , the fraction of type ia sne that are located in the bulge , which is governed by the @xmath22 parameter , plays a role not only on the extinction distribution ( see sec . [",
    "sec : extdist_vs_b2 t ] ) but also on the extinction correction factor @xmath102 .",
    "we computed the correction factor @xmath121 for different values of the total face - on optical depth @xmath99 using dust model s0 with @xmath11 and @xmath91 .",
    "we found : @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "we computed the correction factor for @xmath11 , 4.0 and 5.5 using dust model s0 with @xmath92 and @xmath91 .",
    "we recall that these are the values for which the extinction coefficients @xmath81 are available ( see sec .",
    "[ drainecext ] ) .",
    "we found that the corresponding values of the extinction correction factor are @xmath115 , 1.31 , 1.34 .",
    "when the determination of @xmath102 is concerned , although the detailed geometry of dust can be neglected , the dust content , properties and the bulge size still play a major role .",
    "the computation of @xmath102 for a real sn search requires indeed several simulations : one for each `` galaxy class '' which is defined by the tuple @xmath127 . if the sn rates can not be computed ( and hence corrected ) for each galaxy class separately , a global correction factor @xmath128 should be derived from a weighted mean of the @xmath129 obtained for each galaxy class @xmath130 , with weights given by the fraction of objects in each galaxy class .",
    "we presented a new monte carlo approach to the problem of determining the effect of host galaxy extinction on observed sn properties and to compute the extinction correction factor for sn rate .",
    "although we provided a detailed discussion of the role played by the model free - parameters , our main purpose was to outline the recipe to derive the extinction correction factor @xmath102 for type ia sn .",
    "our main results are that ( 1 ) the value of @xmath102 is almost insensitive to the particular spiral geometry of dust and hence a plain exponential disk is a good approximation .",
    "( 2 ) the value of @xmath102 strongly depends on the galaxy physical properties , in particular the total face - on optical depth @xmath99 , the value of @xmath14 and the size of the bulge @xmath22 .",
    "if we adopt a milky way - like dust @xmath131 , @xmath91 and the range of most likely total face - on optical depths @xmath132 @xcite , the corresponding range spanned by the extinction correction factor is @xmath133 .",
    "the computation of @xmath102 for a real sn search involves a number of complications due to the heterogeneity of the galaxy sample , the redshift dependence of galaxy properties and finally the variety of type ia sne . in particular , this work did not take into account neither the intrinsic spread in type ia sne absolute magnitudes nor the correlation between the light curve shape ( characterised , e.g. by the @xmath64 parameter ) and the morphological types of sn hosts . such simplifications were possible only because the aim of our work was to provide an overview of the method rather than discussing the application to a real case , which will be instead the subject of a future work .",
    "this application clearly requires a detailed study of the observed galaxy sample and the definition of the corresponding model free - parameters which was beyond the objective of the present study .",
    "finally , we note that , though the approach described in this work can be used also for core collapse sne , its feasibility is limited both by the lack of adequate spectral libraries and by the extreme heterogeneity of these objects .",
