    "the causal dynamical triangulations approach to the construction of quantum theories of gravity is patterned on lattice regularization approaches to the construction of quantum theories of fields . while one introduces a lattice regularization to render the quantum theory well - defined , one is ultimately interested in the hypothetical continuum limit in which the regularization is removed in such a manner that physical quantities remain finite .",
    "the existence of a continuum limit of the lattice - regularized quantum theory is typically contingent on this theory exhibiting a second order phase transition .",
    "the nontriviality of a continuum limit is then contingent on the existence of an ultraviolet fixed point along the second order phase transition .",
    "the identification of such a fixed point calls for a renormalization group analysis , which one performs in concert with finite size scaling .",
    "there is now compelling evidence for the existence of a second order phase transition within the causal dynamical triangulations of @xmath0-dimensional einstein gravity .",
    "this second order phase transition moreover occurs at the boundary of the phase exhibiting physical quantum geometry , potentially implying that the hypothetical continuum limit also possesses this property .",
    "a search for this continuum limit in the form of an ultraviolet fixed point is thus clearly warranted .",
    "ambjrn , grlich , jurkiewicz , kreienbuehl , and loll very recently made the first such attempt . under their simplest interpretation of the continuum limit",
    ", they did not find evidence for the existence of an ultraviolet fixed point , but , under a more complicated interpretation of the continuum limit , they did find plausible evidence for the existence of an ultraviolet fixed point .",
    "i propose a renormalization group scheme that differs significantly from those of these authors .",
    "hopefully , my proposal assists in the search for an ultraviolet fixed point within the causal dynamical triangulations of @xmath0-dimensional einstein gravity .      in paper i of this two - part series ,",
    "i considered the formulation and implementation of a renormalization group scheme for lattice - regularized quantum theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "drawing on the well - established methods for renormalization group analysis of lattice - regularized quantum theories of fields , i proposed a general method for renormalization group analysis of lattice - regularized quantum theories of gravity .",
    "i now review my proposal , dividing its procedure into six steps . the first four steps ,",
    "although separated in the following for clarify of presentation , are so intimately connected that one typically pursues them all at once .",
    "moreover , one should subject these four steps to a comprehensive statistical analysis , only proceeding subsequently with the last two steps .",
    "one first selects a model for the continuum limit of the lattice - regularized quantum theory of gravity .",
    "a model consists of a progression of theories @xmath1 along a renormalization group trajectory within some truncation @xmath2 of the space @xmath3 of all theories . from numerical measurements interpreted with respect to the model ,",
    "one aims to specify this progression of theories by determining the values of the renormalized couplings characterizing each theory .",
    "one constructs the renormalization group flows of the model s couplings in this manner .",
    "there is of course no guarantee that the lattice - regularized quantum theory of gravity possesses a continuum limit .",
    "typically , the existence of a continuum limit requires the existence of a second order phase transition within the quantum theory s phase structure .",
    "even if a continuum limit does not exist , the theory might prove effective over a considerable range of scales , so one might still want a continuous description with a finite ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "one next selects a finite size scaling _",
    "ansatz _ relating discrete quantities within the lattice - regularized quantum theory of gravity to continuous quantities within the chosen model for its continuum limit .",
    "this _ ansatz _ should be consistent with the chosen model in that it should be based on a correspondence between a physical observable of the chosen model and the hypothesized discrete analogue of this physical observable .",
    "the form of the finite size scaling _",
    "ansatz _ may vary across the phase diagram of the lattice - regularized quantum theory of gravity as different scaling regimes are encountered .",
    "one delineates renormalization group trajectories as follows . consider a physical observable @xmath4 of the chosen model for the continuum limit whose value generically depends on the length scale @xmath5 which one probes .",
    "suppose that one has experimental access to @xmath4 on the interval of scales @xmath6 .",
    "a renormalization group transformation effects a change in the interval of scales to which one has access , in general , from @xmath6 to @xmath7 . since a renormalization group transformation does not effect changes in physics , measurements of @xmath4 on the interval of scales @xmath6 and on the interval of scales",
    "@xmath7 must agree within the intersection @xmath8 of these two intervals .",
    "accordingly , one delineates a renormalization group trajectory as the progression of theories through the space @xmath3 along which the physics of physical observables do not change . the number of physical observables required to delineate a renormalization group trajectory",
    "depends on the chosen model .",
    "a physical observable @xmath4 is either dimensionless or dimensionful .",
    "the value of a dimensionless physical observable at some scale @xmath5 is simply a real number .",
    "the value of a dimensionful physical observable at some scale @xmath5 is also a real number , namely the ratio of the physical observable to a standard unit of measure .",
    "this reasoning also applies to the scale @xmath5 at which a physical observable is measured . to measure a dimensionful physical observable",
    ", one thus requires an appropriate standard unit of measure .",
    "i assume the presence of certain constants of nature , such as the speed of light and the planck constant , that allow for any physical observable s dimension to be expressed in powers of length .    typically , one employs a standard unit of measure defined externally , meaning that the dynamics through which the standard unit of measure is defined are sufficiently decoupled from the dynamics to which the standard unit of measure is applied . in the context of lattice - regularized quantum theories of gravity ,",
    "external reference scales are usually lacking , so one must choose a dynamically generated scale ",
    "itself defined by a particular physical observable  to serve as the standard unit of measure .",
    "when one implements a renormalization group scheme , one attempts to ascertain whether or not one s chosen standard unit of measure functions as a good standard .",
    "when one extracts any dimensionful physical observable from numerical measurements , one necessarily obtains its value in units of the lattice spacing @xmath9 .",
    "( the lattice spacing is the only dimensionful quantity present . ) for the chosen standard unit of length @xmath10 , numerical measurements yield @xmath11 .",
    "since the lattice spacing is _ a priori _ arbitrary , one sets its value in units of @xmath12 .",
    "one takes @xmath13 not as a measurement of @xmath10 in units of @xmath9 but as a definition of @xmath9 in units of @xmath10 .",
    "one then measures any other scale @xmath5 , determined from numerical measurements only as @xmath14 , by forming the ratio @xmath15 , which is independent of @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , the choice of a standard unit of length @xmath10 makes definite the interval of scales @xmath6 accessible at some point along a renormalization group trajectory .",
    "one defines @xmath16 as the smallest scale present  the lattice spacing @xmath9measured in units of @xmath10 , and one defines @xmath17 as the largest scale present measured in units of @xmath10 .",
    "one now determines how to extract the renormalized couplings of the chosen model for the continuum limit .",
    "one must perform a set of numerical measurements whose outcomes yield the values of the renormalized couplings when put in correspondence with the chosen model _ via _ the finite size scaling _ ansatz_.      one",
    "next implements a renormalization group transformation .",
    "no matter the means by which one effects a renormalization group transformation  typically a coarse graining procedure ",
    "it must integrate out degrees of freedom on the interval of scales @xmath18 while preserving the physics of physical observables .",
    "one finally constructs the renormalization group flows of the chosen model s couplings by iterating the renormalization group transformation and extracting their values after each iteration . for a renormalization group transformation that incrementally increases @xmath16 and leaves fixed @xmath17",
    ", one may take the value of @xmath19 as the parameter along the flow .",
    "now , in paper ii of this two - part series , i apply this method to the case of causal dynamical triangulations .",
    "i review the formalism of causal dynamical triangulations in section [ theory ] , and i review the phenomenology of causal dynamical triangulations in section [ phenomenology ] .",
    "as i argued in paper i , the phenomenology of a lattice - regularized quantum theory of gravity forms the basis of a renormalization group scheme .",
    "accordingly , i provide a comprehensive discussion , paying particular attention to the phenomenological scales that arise dynamically . drawing on this phenomenology ,",
    "i propose a renormalization group scheme for causal dynamical triangulations in section [ renormalization ] .",
    "this proposal constitutes the paper s primary novel contribution .",
    "there remains an ambiguity in my scheme  the choice of a standard unit of length , more than one of which appears to be consistent  that i hope its implementation resolves .",
    "i conclude in section [ conclusion ] by considering how the observed phase structure of causal dynamical triangulations might mesh with my proposed renormalization group scheme .",

    "how should one regularize the integration s divergences ?    the causal dynamical triangulations approach prescribes a rigorous definition of the path integration in equation that addresses all of these difficulties .",
