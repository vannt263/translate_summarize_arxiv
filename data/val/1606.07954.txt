    "the accretion flows in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are commonly accompanied by jet outflows or disk winds .",
    "the presence of jet outflows is often deduced from radio emission .",
    "radio observations of jet outflows have revealed that they are highly collimated , often relativistic , and are launched close to the compact object @xcite .",
    "disk winds are typically studied via narrow line features in x - ray spectra ; they have a more equatorial geometry , are much slower , and are formed further out @xcite .",
    "observed behavior in the black hole ( bh ) lmxb h1743332 suggested that jets and disk winds are causally related @xcite ; later , @xcite found that in the bh lmxb grs 1915 + 105 the jet outflows are typically quenched when strong disk winds are present ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a large study of bh lmxbs by @xcite revealed that disk winds ( in high - inclination systems ) are mainly found in the spectrally soft x - ray state .",
    "combined with the fact that radio jets in bh lmxbs are predominantly found in the spectrally hard x - ray state @xcite , this suggested that jets and disk winds are to a large extent mutually exclusive .",
    "@xcite analyzed the data of two high - inclination neutron star ( ns ) lmxbs and found that the fe k absorption lines , which are often used to trace disk winds ( or disk atmospheres ) , showed the same dependence on spectral state as in the bh systems .",
    "however , the spectral resolution of their data was too low to measure possible outflow velocities .",
    "the above findings on the state dependence of disk winds in bh and ns lmxbs come mostly from systems with luminosities less than a few tens of percent of the eddington luminosity ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the only exception to the overall trend seen in the sample of @xcite is grs 1915 + 105 , which has shown disk winds in a luminous hard state ( @xmath10.3 @xmath0 ) ; in that observation grs 1915 + 105 produced a jet and disk wind at the same time @xcite .",
    "this behavior could indicate that , as the luminosity starts approaching @xmath0 , the relation between disk winds and jets ( and spectral state ) may change from that at lower luminosities . in this paper",
    "we explore this idea further by using existing literature on disk winds and radio jets in the ns lmxb gx 13 + 1 , in combination with archival _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( _ rxte _ ) data of that source .",
    "gx 13 + 1  is a persistently bright ns lmxb .",
    "the source was initially classified as a so - called atoll source by @xcite on the basis of _ exosat _ data , although @xcite had grouped it with the z sources , a subclass of the ns lmxbs with luminosities near or above @xmath0 . a recent analysis by ( * ?",
    "* hereafter f15 ) showed that , at least during the lifetime of _ rxte _  ( 19952012 ) , gx 13 + 1  showed properties more similar to the z sources .",
    "periodic ( 24.27 day ) absorption dips have been observed in the x - ray light curves of gx 13 + 1  @xcite , implying a high inclination ( 65@xmath270@xmath2 ) . as in other high - inclination systems , evidence for a warm absorber",
    "was found in gx 13 + 1 , with _",
    "asca _ and _ xmm - newton _  @xcite .",
    "later observations with _",
    "chandra _  revealed that the absorption lines from this warm absorber were significantly blueshifted , indicating the presence of a disk wind with outflow velocities of up to @xmath1800 kms@xmath3   @xcite .",
    "evidence for a disk wind was also seen in near - infrared spectra of gx 13 + 1 ; these revealed a strong p cygni profile in the br@xmath4 line from which an outflow velocity of @xmath12400 kms@xmath3  was inferred @xcite .",
    "it is not clear whether the winds observed in x - rays and near - infrared are one and the same , or if they represent two distinct outflows originating in different parts of the accretion disk .",
    "gx 13 + 1   is variable in the radio @xcite , with luminosities similar to those of the other z sources @xcite , indicating the presence of strong jet outflows . as in most of the other z sources ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the evolution of the radio flux of gx 13 + 1  suggests that the jet is strongest on the so - called normal ( nb ) and horizontal branches ( hb ) of its z track , and strongly suppressed on its flaring branch ( fb , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "while the x - ray spectral state dependence of the radio emission in gx 13 + 1  has been studied , this is not the case for the disk wind . in this paper",
    "we show that disk winds in gx 13 + 1  are found in the same spectral state in which the radio flux reaches its maximum , suggesting that disk winds and radio jets can be produced simultaneously in this source . in section [ sec : obs ] we present the",

    "data for the two vla observations were included in the track for group d by f15 and they are highlighted in the middle panel of figure [ fig : cd ] . during the first vla observation ( shown in green ) , when the source had a flux density of @xmath10.25 mjy , the source was on the fb and at nb / fb vertex .",
    "the source was much brighter in the radio in the second vla observation ( shown in orange ) , with flux densities of 1.37.2 mjy , and was likely producing a strong jet . in that observation",
    "gx 13 + 1  was located on the upper nb and at the nb / hb vertex .",
    "as mentioned earlier , signatures of a warm absorber were also seen in all _ asca _ and _ xmm - newton _  observations of gx 13 + 1 .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _  spectra suggest outflow velocities up to 3700 kms@xmath3  @xcite , which is considerably larger than the velocities found with _",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite point out that it is plausible that the observed blueshifts are overestimated compared to the real ones , due to residual calibration uncertainties in the epic pn camera of _ xmm - newton_. a detailed analysis of a single epic pn timing mode observation by @xcite resulted in the detection of only one possibly blueshifted absorption line : a fe xxvi k@xmath12 , with a suggested blueshift of @xmath13 kms@xmath3 .",
    "as we have discussed in section [ sec : cha ] and shown in figure [ fig : cd ] , the six _ chandra _  observations of gx 13 + 1  for which we have spectral state information all showed indications for disk winds and were carried out when the source was on its hb or nb .",
    "this is also the part of the z track on which the radio luminosity of gx 13 + 1 , and presumably its jet production as well , is strongest ( section [ sec : vla ] ) .",
    "although the _ chandra _  and vla observations were not performed simultaneously , they seem to suggest that when gx 13 + 1  is on the hb / nb it can produce disk winds as well as radio jets .",
    "radio emission is much weaker on the fb and it is not clear whether the radio emission on the fb is from a compact jet or from previously launched ejecta .",
    "the _ chandra _  observations do not provide information on the presence of disk winds on the fb .    in the _ rxte _",
    "data set analyzed by f15 , gx 13 + 1  can be found on the fb @xmath130% of the time .",
    "none of the six _ chandra _  observations listed in table [ tab : obs ] were made when the source was on the fb .",
    "however , given the fraction of time that gx 13 + 1  spends on the fb , it is likely that at least some of the _ asca _ and _ xmm - newton _  observations ( nine in total ) were done when gx 13 + 1  was on the fb .",
    "several of the _ xmm - newton _  light curves presented in @xcite show substantial flaring , suggesting that this indeed is the case .",
    "this , in turn , indicates that the warm absorber in gx 13 + 1  is present along its entire z track , although its outflow properties on the fb are uncertain .",
    "prompted by our findings in gx 13 + 1 , we searched the literature for indications of simultaneous jets and disk winds in other lmxbs .",
    "these indications can either come from winds and jets being associated with the same spectral state ( like in gx 13 + 1 ) and/or jets and winds being detected close in time .",
    "given the high luminosity of gx 13 + 1 , our search for other cases focused on , but was not limited to , other lmxbs with near- or super - eddington luminosities .",
    "we first consider the other z sources .",
    "while all six of the classical z sources ( sco x-1 , gx 17 + 2 , gx 340 + 0 , gx 349 + 2 , cyg x-2 , and gx 51 ) have shown evidence for radio jets @xcite , only one has shown signatures of disk winds in its x - ray spectra : gx 340 + 0 .",
    "@xcite report on the detection ( with _ chandra _ ) of absorption features in the fe k band of this source .",
    "the strongest of these features , when fitted with photoionization models , implies a fast disk wind with an outflow velocity of @xmath14 kms@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite do not state on what part of the z track the wind was detected .",
    "we used the aglc package for the interactive spectral interpretation system @xcite to create an hid from the four archival _",
    "chandra_/hetgs observations of gx 340 + 0 .",
    "the results of a comparison with a more complete hid constructed from _ rxte _  data ( using similar energy bands ) are ambiguous , given the differences in the shapes of the two hids ( likely due to differences in the detector responses within the chosen energy bands ) .",
    "however , based on the intermediate hardness of the _ chandra _  observation in which the disk wind was detected , our best guess is that the observation was done when the source was on the nb .",
    "@xcite reported on simultaneous x - ray and radio observations of gx 340 + 0 , during which the source traced out the nb and fb .",
    "the highest radio fluxes were detected when the source was on the nb .",
    "this could indicate that , like gx 13 + 1 , when gx 340 + 0 is on the nb it can produce radio jets and/or disk winds , although this interpretation strongly relies on our best guess of the source state during the disk wind detection with _ chandra_.    while none of the other classical z sources have shown evidence for disk winds in their x - ray spectra @xcite , signatures of a disk wind were seen in near - infrared spectra of sco x-1 .",
    "@xcite detected a p cygni profile in the br@xmath4 line , indicating an outflow velocity of @xmath12600 kms@xmath3 .",
    "we note that @xcite did not see a p cygni profile for the br@xmath4 line in their observations , possibly indicating that the disk wind in sco x-1 is variable .",
    "it is not clear on which z source branches these near - infrared observations took place .",
    "however , given the fact that the compact radio core of sco x-1 is seemingly always detected @xcite , the detection of disk wind signatures in the near - infrared suggests that sco x-1 can ( at least occasionally ) produce simultaneous jets and disk winds , regardless of the branch it was on during the observations of @xcite .",
    "cir x-1 is a ns lmxb that shows clear z source behavior at its highest luminosities @xcite and turns into an atoll source at lower luminosities ( f15 ) . @xcite and @xcite observed the source twice with _",
    "chandra _",
    "( close to orbital phase 0.0 ) in 2000 , i.e.  when cir x-1 was still exhibiting z source behavior , and detected several p cygni lines that indicate a strong disk wind with inferred outflow velocities of @xmath12001900 kms@xmath3 . both of these _",

    "while the wind is present along the entire track , there is significant evolution in the profile of several of the strongest p cygni lines ( see figure 7 in @xcite ) .",
    "the second _ chandra _  observation was likely more strongly affected by absorption ( given the very high soft color values of the accompanying _ rxte _  data ) and as a result the z source branches could not be clearly identified in the _ rxte _  data . @xcite",

    "although radio flares from cir x-1 experienced a long - term lull during that period @xcite , the source was still active in the radio , with flux densities between a few mjy and a few tens of mjy .",
    "radio emission from the core generally appeared to be present at all orbital phases , but was highly variable and its relation to position along the z track is not well understood @xcite . while the _ chandra _  and radio data therefore support the possibility of jets and disk winds being present at the same time during the z source phase of cir x-1 , especially given the presence of a disk wind along the entire z track of the first _",

    "observation in 2000 , the case is not as clear as those for gx 13 + 1  and sco x-1 .",

    ", this gives a luminosity of @xmath10.3 @xmath0 .",
    "although this is well below @xmath0 , it is higher than the typical hard - state peak luminosities of transient bh lmxbs @xcite , suggesting that a high luminosity is fundamentally important to produce winds in bh hard states ( see also section [ sec : disc ] ) .",

    "the intrinsic luminosities during these _ chandra _   observations , while probably still sub - eddington , were likely well above the 0.0050.05 @xmath0  luminosities implied by the ( non - absorption - corrected ) 210 kev fluxes . during the same outburst @xcite observed p cygni profiles in various optical h and he emission lines , indicating a disk wind with terminal outflow velocities in the range of @xmath115003000 kms@xmath3 .",
    "v404 cyg was active in the radio at the time of these optical and x - ray observations @xcite , which suggests that the source was producing disk winds and jets at the same time , as already pointed out by @xcite .",
    "we note that _",
    "fermi_/gbm observations indicate that v404 cyg remained in the hard state throughout its 2015 outburst @xcite , but we note there was often strong variability within observations .",
    "simultaneous jet and disk wind production likely also occurred during the 1989 outburst of the source ; @xcite detected p cygni profiles in optical h and he emission lines when the source was still bright in the radio with a flat spectrum @xcite .",
    "@xcite report on simultaneous _ chandra_/hetgs and australia telescope compact array radio observations during an outburst of 4u 1630@xmath1847 . in 2012",
    "january , when 4u 1630@xmath1847 was in a spectrally soft state ( @xmath190.1 @xmath0 , for a 10 @xmath17 bh ) , they detected clear x - ray signatures of a disk wind ( with speeds of @xmath1200500 kms@xmath3 ) while the source was also detected in the radio .",
    "however , the radio emission was optically thin at that point , suggesting that it was due to jet ",
    "ism interaction far from the bh , rather than from a jet that was being launched at the same time as the disk wind .",
    "finally , although it is not an lmxb , it is worth mentioning the high - mass x - ray binary ss433 @xcite , which likely harbors a bh .",
    "this famous jet source ( see @xcite for a review ) is a supercritical accretor and shows a dense equatorial wind from the accretion disk @xcite with a velocity up to @xmath11300 kms@xmath3 , which feeds into a circumbinary ring @xcite .",
    "the above results show that jets and disk winds in lmxbs are not necessarily mutually exclusive .",
    "the common residence of disk winds and radio emission in ( the spectrally hard states of ) various luminous lmxbs , and in the hmxb ss433 , suggests that the presence of disk winds does not necessarily result in the suppression of radio jets , as was suggested by @xcite for grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "however , there is likely a time scale over which such suppression would happen , e.g.  the time it takes for a mass - energy deficit in the disk to propagate inward to the jet launching region .",
    "in such a scenario , occasional simultaneous detections of jets and disk winds are expected to happen , even if jets and disk winds are largely mutually exclusive . with regard to this , it is also important to stress that detecting radio emission at a given moment does not mean a jet is being produced right at that moment . in the case of short - lived transient jets ,",
    "as observed in , e.g. , grs 1915 + 105 @xcite , we may be detecting radio emission from jet ejecta , rather than from a compact jet .",
    "radio spectral indices are needed to distinguish between the two types of radio emission .",
    "similarly , time - averaged x - ray spectra with signatures of disk winds do not necessarily mean that disk winds are present for the entire duration of such an observation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". long observations ( hours to days ) with sufficient time resolution ( minutes or seconds ) are needed to both study the transient nature of winds and jets , and to constrain the time scale on which jet suppression by winds possibly occurs .",
    "sources in luminous steady hard states would be the preferred targets for such observations .",
    "it is also important to point out that the non - detection of narrow absorption lines does not automatically indicate the absence of disk winds .",
    "strong photoionization can fully ionize a wind , resulting in the disappearance of absorption lines @xcite .    in the sources studied by @xcite winds",
    "are predominantly observed in spectrally soft states with luminosities up to a few tens of percent of @xmath0 .",
    "these winds are thought to be thermally driven as the result of compton heating @xcite .",
    "the general absence of winds in spectrally hard states with similar luminosities might be the result of less efficient compton heating due to , for example , a large fraction of the x - rays being beamed away from the outer disk @xcite , or a disk geometry that is less favorable to irradiation @xcite . for the three systems discussed in section [ sec : results ] for which we have state information , we found that the simultaneous jets / winds were observed in the sources spectrally hardest states ( i.e. , with the strongest non - thermal contribution ) : the hb / nb for gx 13 + 1  and the hard state for grs 1915 + 105 and v404 cyg .",
    "these states have historically only been associated with radio jets .",
    "the reason for the presence of disk winds in these ` jet states ' is probably the relatively high x - ray luminosity of the sources , ranging from @xmath10.3 @xmath0  in grs 1915 + 105 to near- or super-@xmath0  in v404 cyg .",
    "this is higher than the peak hard - state luminosities observed in other high - inclination bh or ns lmxbs @xcite .",
    "the simplest explanation for winds in these spectrally hard states is that the high luminosities compensate for intrinsically less efficient compton heating of the accretion disk in such states .",
    "the near- or super - eddington luminosities in v404 cyg , gx 13 + 1 , sco x-1 , and cir x-1 further suggest that the winds in those systems may be partially radiatively driven , since radiation pressure on electrons can become an important factor @xcite .",
    "winds have also been suggested as a by - product of radiatively inefficient accretion flows @xcite , which are thought to exist in spectrally hard states @xcite .",
    "there is observational evidence @xcite and theoretical support @xcite for this .",
    "these winds are not thermally or radiatively driven , but are rather driven by centrifugal forces and magnetic pressure gradients .",
    "it is not clear why they would only be seen in higher luminosity hard states , or whether they should be observationally distinguishable from the winds produced in softer states .",
    "the p cygni br@xmath4 line detected in the near - infrared spectrum of gx 13 + 1  indicates an outflow speed for the disk wind of @xmath12400 kms@xmath3@xcite .",
    "this is substantially higher than the maximum outflow speed inferred from the _ chandra _  spectra ( @xmath1800 kms@xmath3 ) .",
    "since the br@xmath4 line is produced further out in the disk wind than the x - ray absorption lines , this could indicate that the wind is still being accelerated at large radii ( assuming the lines are all produced by the same wind ) .",
    "however , simultaneous x - ray and near - infrared spectra of gx 13 + 1  ( and other lmxbs ) are needed to verify this .",
    "finally , we note that the simultaneous presence of jets and disk winds is not unique to luminous x - ray binaries and appears to be fairly common in radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , which are characterized by their strong jet emission .",
    "@xcite studied 26 of these systems and concluded that in 50@xmath620% of the radio - loud agn ( fast ) winds are present . unlike the winds in lmxbs , these winds are not preferentially equatorial and have a large opening angle .",
    "radio - loud agns also span a wider range in fractional @xmath0   ( @xmath20 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than the x - ray binary systems in which we see indications of simultaneous jets and winds .",
    "the fact that radio - loud agns can also produce winds at lower @xmath0  fractions is possibly due to more efficient uv line driving @xcite .",

    "<S> recent work on jets and disk winds in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) suggests that they are to a large extent mutually exclusive , with jets observed in spectrally hard states and disk winds observed in spectrally soft states . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we use existing literature on jets and disk winds in the luminous neutron star ( ns ) lmxb gx 13 + 1 , in combination with archival _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ data , to show that this source is likely able to produce jets and disk winds simultaneously . we find that jets and disk winds occur in the same location on the source s track in its x - ray color - color diagram </S>",
    "<S> . a further study of literature on other luminous lmxbs reveals that this behavior is more common , with indications for simultaneous jets and disk winds in the black hole lmxbs v404 cyg and grs 1915 + 105 and the ns lmxbs sco x-1 and cir x-1 . </S>",
    "<S> for the three sources for which we have the necessary spectral information , we find that the simultaneous jets / winds all occur in their spectrally hardest states . </S>",
    "<S> our findings indicate that in lmxbs with luminosities above a few tens of percent of the eddington luminosity , jets and disk winds are not mutually exclusive , and that the presence of disk winds does not necessarily result in jet suppression . </S>"
