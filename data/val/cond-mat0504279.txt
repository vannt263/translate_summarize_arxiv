    "for the first time , the theory of the coherent bremsstrahlung and electron - positron pair production in single crystals was published in ref .",
    "@xcite . up to now , these processes have been much studied both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "the specific peculiarities of the coherent processes were widely used for obtaining linearly polarized @xmath0-beams in polarization measurements @xcite and for increasing the @xmath1-beam intensity @xcite .",
    "these experimental investigations were carried out in a wide energy range of electron , positron and @xmath0-beams from a few hundreds of mev to 100 - 200 gev . as a rule ,",
    "simple crystallographic structures were used in experiments .",
    "both experiments and theory show that , with the increasing of the particle energy , the requirements on the beam divergence become more strict . besides , at high enough energies the process of coherent bremsstrahlung is violated , due to the magneto - bremsstrahlung mechanism @xcite .",
    "this mechanism provides the linear polarization of the emitted @xmath0-quanta .",
    "however , a sufficiently small angle divergence of the electron beam is needed for utilizing this phenomenon .",
    "one of the main requirements , which restricts the use of coherent processes , is the small size of the fundamental cell of the single crystals , which has to be of the order of some angstroms .",
    "it is our opinion that , finding atomic periodic structures with a minimal period of tens or hundreds angstroms , may yield a good solution to the above - mentioned problem .    in recent years",
    ", considerable advances have been made in the creation of various nanostructures @xcite , such as regular two - dimensional arrays , fullerite crystals , nanofilms , nanotube superlattices and so on . in a number of papers",
    "@xcite nanotube lattices were considered as a source of channeling radiation .",
    "other applications of nanotubes for purposes of high energy physics are also described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "according to ref .",
    "@xcite single - wall nanotubes are uniform in diameter and self - organized into ropes , which consist of 100 to 500 nanotubes in a two - dimensional triangular lattice with a lattice constant of 17 angstroms . in our talk @xcite we discussed the processes of coherent bremsstrahlung and @xmath2-pair production in the nanotube superlattice . in considering this task we met problems",
    ", the solution of which has a common meaning for the above - mentioned coherent processes in various nanostructures and complex single crystals .",
    "below we give an introduction to these problems , using the example of the nanotube superlattice .",
    "1 illustrates the three - dimensional superlattice of ( 10,10 ) armchair single wall nanotubes . in this case",
    "we can write for the vector - radius @xmath3 of the @xmath4-th atom in the nanotube @xmath5",
    "@xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the indices corresponding to atoms placed in two parallel planes , @xmath9 is the radius of the ring , @xmath10 is the period ( i.e. the size of the fundamental cell ) in the @xmath11-direction , @xmath12 are the angle shifts ( @xmath13 const ) .    in fig .",
    "1 we describe an ideal nanostructure where the angle shifts of all nanotubes are the same .",
    "the experiments @xcite show that these angle shifts are distributed randomly or , in other words , every nanotube is turned at some different angle .",
    "this means that the content of every cell will be different , relative to the coordinate system .",
    "thus , the nanotube lattice is not a periodic structure in a strict sense , in spite of the constancy of the distance between neighboring nanotubes .",
    "however , the existing theory of coherent bremsstrahlung holds its validity for atomic structures ( single crystals ) , which are periodic in a strict sense .    based on this example , we formulate the common problem for the calculation of the coherent bremsstrahlung in artificial and natural nanostructures .",
    "the problem is the violation of the periodicity in a strict sense in these structures .",
    "this situation is well known in the diffraction physics of x - rays @xcite in imperfect structures .",
    "however , the process of coherent bremsstrahlung was investigated and utilized mainly in simple single crystals .",
    "such crystals as silicon and diamond have a negligibly small degree of mosaicity and admixture .",
    "because of this fact , the problem of calculation of the bremsstrahlung in imperfect structures did not practically appear ( except for the problem of the thermal atomic motion @xcite ) . in the x - ray diffraction theory",
    "the above - mentioned problem was solved with the help of the introduction of the averaged electron density @xcite . in our talk",
    "@xcite , using the analogy in the description of the diffraction and coherent processes , we could solve this problem on the basis of physical sense .",
    "besides , we suggest another approach which is based on computer simulations .",
    "we think that this approach may be extended to a wide class of analogous problems , in particular , for a nanotube lattice with a more complicated dependence on the angle shifts , than a random one .",
    "it is turns that our computer approach has an analytical solution in the general case .",
    "furthermore , on the basis of our method we are able to consider the process of coherent bremsstrahlung in imperfect atomic structures , taking into account all fluctuations factors .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we give a mathematical introduction in the problem . in section iii ,",
    "for the description of fluctuations in atomic structures , we introduce the normalized probability density function and formulate some rules for averaging of the structure factors . in section",
    "iv we consider the three dimensional model of the real atomic structure with fluctuations .",
    "the results obtained here allow us to derive ( in section v ) the coherent and incoherent cross sections of the bremsstrahlung process in imperfect structures . in section",
    "vi we discuss the influence of thermal fluctuations in atomic structures on the coherent bremsstrahlung . here",
    "we reproduce well known results and also obtain new ones . in section vii",
    "we consider the possibility of generalizing our theory to consider multiatomic structures and , in particular , multiatomic single crystals .",
    "samples of calculations of the bremsstrahlung process in real atomic structures are presented in section viii . in conclusion ( in section ix )",
    "we give shortly the main results of our investigations .",
    "the differential cross section of the coherent bremsstrahlung for ideal periodic structure , consisting of atoms , can be written in the following form @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the bremsstrahlung cross section for an isolated atom , @xmath16 is the three - dimensional transfer momentum , @xmath17 are the vector - radii of the atoms in the periodic structure .    from this expression , the following relation for the cross section per atom @xcite is derived : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the number of atoms in the fundamental cell of the structure , @xmath20 is the volume of the fundamental cell , @xmath21 is the structure factor @xcite , @xmath22 is the vector of the reciprocal lattice , @xmath23 is the delta - function , @xmath24 are the energies of the initial electron and bremsstrahlung @xmath0-quantum and @xmath25 is the planck constant .",
    "the structure factors are calculated from the relation @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the radius of the @xmath4-th atom in the fundamental cell .    from eq .",
    "( 5 ) one can see that the specific character of every atomic structure is defined by its structure factors .",
    "it is obvious that for ideal structures ( at a fixed localization of the atoms ) the structure factors take well defined values . because of various fluctuations",
    ", the coordinates of atoms in the fundamental cell are changed with space and ( or ) time and this fact does not allow to use eq .",
    "( 5 ) for calculations . for this reason , it is necessary to understand the behavior of the structure factors for these fluctuations .",
    "the plan of our further actions for solving the above - mentioned problem is the following : we will try to reduce the problem to one , for which the solution is known ( such as the process in the ideal periodic lattice ) . in the first stage of the study",
    ", we will formulate the definition and some rules for the averaged structure factors .",
    "then , we will consider the simulations of fluctuations on the model of real periodic structures , and thereafter we will use the obtained results for the calculation of the coherent bremsstrahlung cross section in imperfect atomic structures .",
    "it should be noted that in the theory of coherent bremsstrahlung the potential of the crystal is considered as the sum of isolated atomic potentials .",
    "it is obvious that this assumption is only approximately true .",
    "however , the current experimental experience ( see , for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) shows the correctness of this statement with a high enough accuracy . in this paper",
    "we will also hold this statement true and because of this , our results will be easy to compare with the standard theory . in the following ,",
    "we will make use of the expression `` coordinates of the atomic center '' which has an exact physical meaning denoting the coordinates of the atomic nucleus .",
    "as previously noted , the specific character of every structure is defined by its structure factors .",
    "it is useful to appreciate the physical meaning of these quantities . for this purpose ,",
    "we write the atomic density for a periodic structure in the point given by the vector - radius @xmath28 @xmath29 from here , it follows that @xmath30 is the fourier component of the atomic density or , in other words , the structure factors are the atomic images in the reciprocal space .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( 7 ) does not take into account thermal atomic fluctuations .",
    "they are easy to calculate with the help of the following multiplier : @xmath31 ( see below ) .",
    "we stress that the structure factors depend on the choice of a coordinate system and therefore the values of structure factors have a physical meaning only in a defined coordinate system .",
    "the space distribution of the atomic centers in the fundamental cell of the structure can be described with the help of the normalized probability density function @xmath32 , where @xmath33 are the space displacements of the atomic centers from the points @xmath27 in the cell .",
    "the integral of this function over the whole ( @xmath34-dimensional)@xmath35 volume of the cell is equal to 1 .",
    "then the structure factor , averaged with the help of @xmath36-function , is given by @xmath37 where the @xmath38-function reads @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "now we can find the following coordinate - independent value : @xmath41    in a similar manner , one can define the average square module of the structure factor @xmath42 where @xmath43 here the term @xmath44 indicates that the integration takes place over the whole space variables , except the ones belonging to the @xmath45-atoms .",
    "taking into account the relations obtained here , we can write for the dispersion @xmath46 d{\\bf{x}}_i d{\\bf{x}}_j,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduced the following notation : @xmath47 .    in the case",
    "when the @xmath48 and @xmath49 variables are statistically independent , the following relation takes place : @xmath50 .",
    "if all @xmath19-atoms are statistically independent , the normalized probability density function may be represented as @xmath51 and eq .",
    "( 13 ) can be rewritten in the following form : @xmath52 in the case when all the atoms in the fundamental cell are equivalent , this equation has the following simple form : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the averaged function @xmath55    it should be noted that , for an ideal atomic structure , @xmath56 for every @xmath4 and then @xmath57 .",
    "it is significant that the equations in this section are valid for any vector @xmath22 of the reciprocal space , in particular for any vector of the reciprocal lattice .",
    "besides , there are no indications of the atomic sorts in the equations .",
    "below , it will be shown that the cross section of the coherent bremsstrahlung depends on the averaged structure factors for monoatomic structures and on some combinations of similar factors for multiatomic structures .",
    "thus , eqs .",
    "( 8)-(16 ) are also useful in the case of structures consisting of different atoms .",
    "let us build the three - dimensional ( @xmath58 ) cubic lattice consisting of identical cubic cells with side size equal to @xmath59",
    ". then we can put into every cell an identical number of atoms , which we denote by @xmath19 .",
    "doing this , it would mean knowing the coordinates of every atoms in every cell . let us select a local cartesian coordinate system in every cell .",
    "besides , the probability function of localization of atoms in the cell will be considered as known @xmath60 .",
    "let us suppose that the atomic coordinates in every cell are distributed according to this function .",
    "to be specific , we select the basic cartesian coordinate system in the left and bottom corner of the lattice . with this lattice ( of @xmath61 size ) as the basic element , we can build ( by using parallel translations in @xmath62-directions with a period of @xmath63 ) the three - dimensional infinite periodic ( in the strict sense ) structure .",
    "the main idea in our consideration stems from the fact that the above described superlattice ( at large enough ) contains practically all combinations of atoms in the small cells ( according to the normalized probability density function @xmath36 ) and , on the other hand , this superlattice is periodic in a strict sense .",
    "thus , we can use the coherent bremsstrahlung theory for describing the radiation processes . for this purpose",
    ", the structure factors of the large lattice should be found for every reciprocal vector @xmath64 .",
    "further we will introduce a tilda symbol above the values relative to the large cube lattice with the side of @xmath65 .",
    "thus , these structure factors @xmath66 can be calculated from the following relation : @xmath67 where the reciprocal vector @xmath64 is @xmath68 here @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the unit vectors in @xmath73-directions and the translation vector reads @xmath74 in the basic coordinate system . in eq .",
    "( 17 ) @xmath75 denotes the following structure factor : @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the vector - radius of the @xmath78-th atom in the local coordinate system of @xmath79-cell .",
    "the multiplication @xmath80 reads @xmath81 for large enough numbers @xmath82 one can find @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the structure factor @xmath85 averaged over the coordinates and the quantities @xmath86 are integer numbers . in the other cases , one can write @xmath87 eq . (",
    "20 ) is obvious , so at the pointed condition the value @xmath80 is multiplied by @xmath88 and the exponents in eq .",
    "( 20 ) are equal to 1 . for obtaining eq .",
    "( 21 ) we should take into account that there is only a finite number of the various exponents in eq .",
    "( 17 ) ( this number @xmath89 , the equality holding when @xmath82 is a prime number ) .",
    "grouping the terms near the same exponents , we get @xmath90 here we can remove @xmath91-terms , due to their approximated equality at large enough @xmath82",
    ".    we can consider the structure factor @xmath92 as a statistical variable .",
    "taking into account eqs .",
    "( 20),(21 ) , we find that @xmath93 when @xmath94 are simultaneously integer numbers and @xmath95 in the other cases .",
    "similar calculations allow us to obtain the averaged dispersion of the structure factor @xmath96 for the case of large @xmath82-numbers @xmath97 this equation is valid for arbitrary @xmath98-numbers . however , the value @xmath66 is defined by the limit of eq . (",
    "20 ) in the case when @xmath99 are integer numbers , and @xmath100 in the other cases ( see eq .",
    "( 21 ) ) .",
    "it should be noted that our previous consideration is based on the specific kind of the crystallographic structure .",
    "it is easy to verify that our analysis is valid in the general case .",
    "indeed , the important relation for the correctness of the theory ( see eq . ( 19 ) ) is valid for any real crystallographic structure @xcite .",
    "of course , in the general case , the vector of the reciprocal lattice and the translation vector must be written in the corresponding ( generally nonorthogonal ) coordinate system .",
    "in principle , now we can calculate the coherent bremsstrahlung cross section for the structure described in the previous section .",
    "however , we call to the attention of the reader the fact that the structure factors @xmath66 , in the case when the @xmath86-numbers are nonintegral ones , tend to zero at large @xmath82",
    ". nevertheless , the contribution from these factors to the calculated values may be noticeable , due to their large amount .    in this case , the differential cross section of coherent bremsstrahlung has the following form : @xmath101 here @xmath102 is the volume of the fundamental cell of the structure .    when the number @xmath82 is large enough , we can write ( see eqs .",
    "( 20)-(23 ) ) @xmath103 for the case of the simultaneously integer numbers @xmath86 and @xmath104 for the other cases .",
    "taking into account these relations and eq .",
    "( 20 ) , we get @xmath105 we see that the total cross section represents the sum of two terms .",
    "we interpret the first term as the averaged coherent contribution . indeed , the value of this cross section calculated per atom is proportional to n and inversely proportional to v. in addition , this cross section is independent of @xmath82 , which defines the size of the large lattice .    it is obvious that the second term describes the common effect due to the incoherent bremsstrahlung in the @xmath58 lattice at large @xmath82-values and the coherent one in the infinite superlattice .",
    "now we can find the energetic cross section by integration over @xmath16 @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the vector directed along the velocity of the electron beam and @xmath108 , @xmath109 is the transversal projection of @xmath16 on the primary electron direction of motion , @xmath110 is the electron mass , @xmath111 is the speed of light , and for the minimal value of the transfer momentum @xmath112 we use the traditional notation .",
    "we see that the second term in eq .",
    "( 28 ) is proportional to a sum over reciprocal vectors @xmath64 ( see eq . ( 18 ) ) . at large ,",
    "this sum is most conveniently expressed by an integral representation .",
    "for this purpose , we use the relation : @xmath113 . as a result , we get @xmath114    we stress that the structure factors in the first term ( see eq . ( 29 ) are discrete values , which depend on the reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath22 , and that the structure factor @xmath115 in the second term is a continuous function of the @xmath116 variable . note that passing from a discrete to a continuous description , one removes the action of the large periodic lattice .",
    "thus , in principle , we have solved the problem of the coherent bremsstrahlung in imperfect periodic atomic structures .",
    "in fact , eq . ( 29 ) represents the sum of the coherent and incoherent contributions in the cross section : @xmath117 .",
    "now both cross sections should be reduced to a form , which is convenient for specific calculations .",
    "first of all , we find the coherent contribution . for this purpose , it is necessary to simplify the cross section @xmath118 as it was described in ref . @xcite .",
    "this simplification is based on the fact that the effective range of @xmath119 , due to thermal fluctuations .    using this condition , and with the help of calculations similar to those in ref .",

    "4 ) . one can see that these functions are slightly smaller than for an amorphous medium .",
    "it should be noted that the calculations were carried out for a three - dimensional structure of nanotubes .",
    "our estimate shows that , for a two - dimensional nanotube lattice , the incoherent contribution is practically the same as in an amorphous medium .    the differential intensity of the coherent bremsstrahlung is shown in fig .",
    "5 .      in this section",
    "we consider the coherent bremsstrahlung in three - atomic single crystals of the scheelite type . for specific calculations , we select @xmath246 and @xmath247 single crystals .",
    "it is interesting to notice that @xmath246 single crystals are widely used for the realization of electromagnetic calorimeters @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the coherent radiation in such structures influences some characteristics of the calorimeters .    a crystallographic structure of the scheelite type",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "the fundamental cell is represented by a the tetragonal prism with the side of the squared basis and the height which are equal to 5.44 ( 5.22 ) and 12.01 ( 11.45 ) angstroms for the @xmath246 ( @xmath247 ) single crystal , respectively .",
    "the fundamental cell contains 4 lead ( calcium ) , 4 tungsten and 16 oxygen atoms .",
    "the oxygen atoms are located at the corners of the tetragons around the tungsten atoms .",
    "using relations similar to eqs .",
    "( 55)-(61 ) we have calculated the differential intensity ( @xmath248 ) and the linear polarization of coherent bremsstrahlung in @xmath246 and @xmath247 single crystals . in these calculations we use three different amplitudes of thermal fluctuations .",
    "one can expect that the energy of the fluctuations is the same for every sort of atoms @xcite .",
    "this means that the amplitude of fluctuations is inversely proportional to the atomic mass . for tungsten atoms we select an amplitude equal to 0.04 angstroms ( as in the tungsten single crystal at room temperature ) .",
    "note that the intensity of the coherent radiation depends weakly enough on the amplitude of fluctuations , and hence our approach is justified .",
    "the calculations were carried out for case when the electron momentum lies in the _ yz_-plane ( see figs .",
    "7,8 ) and the angle between the z - axis and the direction of motion is equal to 5 mrad .",
    "one can see that the behavior of the curves is different for both single crystals .",
    "note that the difference in the lattice constants of both single crystals is small and , because of this , it can not yield the explanation of the effect .",
    "for an understanding of the effect , we should take into account that in monoatomic structures the values of the structure factors determine the set of allowed points of the reciprocal lattice . in our case ,",
    "the @xmath249-values play an analogous role .",
    "the different behavior of these values for the two different single crystals is the main issue in the description of coherent processes .",
    "so , the coherent bremsstrahlung in a @xmath246 single crystal is similar to this process in a monoatomic single crystal .",
    "indeed , the contribution in the intensity of oxygen atoms is small , due to the low z - value .",
    "for the tungsten and lead atoms , the form factors and charges are approximately equal in between , and the allowed points are approximately defined with the help of the factor @xmath250 .",
    "the degree of linear polarization can be defined from the relations    @xmath251    @xmath252    where @xmath253 are the components of the @xmath254-vector on the @xmath255 and @xmath256-axes and @xmath257 is the angle between the @xmath258-plane and the arbitrary plane where the @xmath11-axis is located @xcite . figs .",
    "7,8 illustrate also the degree of linear polarization .",
    "the maximal polarization takes place when in eq .",
    "( 77 ) the incoherent contribution is significantly less than the coherent one .",
    "this situation may be realized for high energy values of the electron beam .",
    "it is necessary to point out the specific peculiarities of coherent bremsstrahlung , which apply to our examples .",
    "the intensities of coherent radiation obtained in this paper were calculated for special orientations of the atomic structures , and they represent so - called ideal spectra @xcite .",
    "due to the specific motion of electrons in the atomic structures , for the description of the real spectra we need to take into account the additional intensity of radiation arising from the nearby directions of motion .",
    "this additional intensity takes place mainly for small @xmath255-values .",
    "however , the above mentioned orientations are convenient for comparison , in various conditions of the radiation sources ( such as different orientations or atomic structures ) , and they are widely covered in the literature . it should be noted that this remark does not indicate a violation of the coherent mechanism .",
    "the reason is that very small deviations of the direction of the electron motion from the @xmath258-plane ( at the orientations pointed out above ) give a sizeable contribution in the radiation intensity ( at low @xmath255 ) .",
    "the intensity spectra are presented for one electron energy .",
    "it is easy to understand their behavior at different energies : the incoherent contribution is practically independent of the electron energy ; the coherent intensity is proportional to this energy , at the condition that the orientation angle is changed in a way inversely proportional to the energy .",
    "the theory of coherent bremsstrahlung is violated at some orientations of atomic structures ( at high enough electron energies ) .",
    "this problem may be investigated according to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the calculated spectra of coherent bremsstrahlung may be interesting for applications of this effect . despite the large volume of the fundamental cell ,",
    "the radiation intensity is large enough , for rather large values of the orientation angle .",
    "calculations show that the incoherent contribution in periodic atomic structures is insignificantly smaller than for the corresponding amorphous ones .",
    "however , a precise determination of the incoherent cross section may be useful , for electron energies smaller than some gev . in this case , the emission angle of the @xmath0-quantum is detectable , and the investigation of the incoherent contribution may give additional information .",
    "our examples illustrate different types of probability density functions . for a nanotube lattice",
    "this function depends only on one coordinate , and the other coordinates are functions of the latter .",
    "the remaining examples illustrate the case when all atoms are independent .",
    "in this paper we have shown that , in imperfect periodic atomic structures , the coherent part of the cross section is defined by the averaged potential of the structure , and the incoherent ( diffusion ) one is defined by the pair correlation functions .",
    "the method considered here allows one to solve the problem , on the basis of the normalized probability density function .",
    "in particular , we have calculated the cross section of coherent bremsstrahlung in polyatomic single crystals with different thermal fluctuations amplitudes .",
    "we also considered further developments of our method for atomic structures with a variable number of atoms in the cell , fluctuating periods , etc",
    ".    in this paper we did not investigate the process of coherent @xmath2-pair production in periodic structures .",
    "however , in this case there is no problem in writing similar equations as for coherent bremsstrahlung , using well known equations for the process and the relations obtained here .",
    "on the basis of our considerations , we think that coherent bremsstrahlung and @xmath1-pair production , at particle energies between a few hundreds of mev and some gev , may be utilized for the investigation and characterization of the atomic structures , in parallel with other methods , such as x - ray diffraction . at these energies ,",
    "the collimation of the electron beam ( or the measurement of the photon angle emission ) is possible , and therefore the possibility of a detailed study of pair correlations appears .    in whole , our investigations may be useful for the search of new sources of coherent radiation .",
