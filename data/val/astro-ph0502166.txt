    "within the standard cosmological cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm , structures form hierarchically via gravitational collapse of primordial density fluctuations .",
    "this framework has been successful at providing physical interpretations for a wide range of phenomena , notably the angular power spectrum of cosmic microwave background anisotropies , the large - scale structure of the galaxy distribution , and fundamental scaling relations in disk galaxies .    in recent years",
    ", significant theoretical progress has also been made in predicting halo shapes obtained from simulations of structure formation in a ( @xmath9)cdm universe .",
    "detailed collisionless numerical simulations of halo assembly ( see reed et al . 2003 and references therein ) have led to a general consensus on the fundamental properties of the resulting cdm halos : their density distributions @xmath10 deviate significantly from the power laws predicted by analytic calculations ( e.g. gunn & gott 1972 ) ; they have a broadly `` universal '' shape over many decades in mass that can be parameterized by simple fitting formulae ; and they are _ cuspy _ , in that @xmath11 at the smallest halo radii @xmath12 probed by simulations , and the intrinsic inner slope @xmath5 is of order 1 .    a simple analytic profile that encompasses these three characteristics was first proposed by navarro et al .",
    "( 1996 ; 1997 , hereafter nfw ) for dark matter halos : @xmath13 ^ 2}\\,\\ , ,   \\label{nfw}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the characteristic halo density and radius , respectively .",
    "subsequent generations of simulations showed some disagreement over the value of @xmath5 that best described the resulting halos : inner slopes shallower than the nfw value of @xmath16 ( subramanian et al .",
    "2000 ; taylor & navarro 2001 ; ricotti 2003 ) and as steep as @xmath5=1.5 ( e.g. fukushige & makino 1997 , 2001 ; moore et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ) have been proposed .",
    "a systematic study of these discrepancies has been undertaken by navarro and collaborators , using a suite of high - resolution simulations that reliably probe galaxy - size halos down to small fractions of their virial radii ( hayashi et al .",
    "2004 ; navarro et al . 2003 ; power et al .",
    "they find that while the density distribution does not converge to a well - defined asymptotic power - law at the innermost resolved radius , the average @xmath5 is 1.1 , 1.2 , and 1.35 at 1% of the virial radii of cluster , galaxy , and dwarf halos , respectively .",
    "the nfw slope @xmath16 remains consistent with the simulated halo shapes , but cusps as steep as @xmath17 are ruled out in almost all cases .",
    "some impacts of the presence of baryons on these halo shapes have been investigated ( e.g. mo & mao 2004 ) ; however , fully self - consistent simulations of halo shapes including a variety of gasdynamical effects have not yet been achieved .    while collisionless halo shapes are consistent with the average properties of high redshift halos inferred from weak lensing studies ( e.g. hoekstra et al .",
    "2004 ) , on galaxy and cluster scales the agreement between theory and observations is much less certain .",
    "the majority of observations rely on luminous tracers embedded at small @xmath12 to probe the halo potential . even though some studies of halo shapes prefer cdm profiles ( e.g. mahdavi & geller 2004 ; pointecouteau et al .",
    "2004 ) , a variety of evidence suggests that at least some real halos do not have the cusps predicted for the pre - baryon collapse systems , but rather _ cores _ in which the inner halo density has only a weak dependence on @xmath12 ( or none at all ) .",
    "for instance , studies of gravitational arcs around clusters ( sand et al . 2004 ; but see el - zant et al .",
    "2004 ) , models of gas flow along strong bars ( weiner et al . 2001 ) , and the mass budget in the milky way from microlensing and stellar kinematics ( binney & evans 2001 ; binney 2004 ) all yield measured inner halo slopes @xmath4 that are much more `` corelike '' ( @xmath18 ) than the cusps predicted by cdm . the rotation curves ( rcs ) of spiral galaxies have also been extensively used to constrain halo structure . in particular ,",
    "salucci ( 2001 ) concludes that halos have cores larger than the corresponding disk scale - lengths from a robust analysis of 137 disk - dominated systems that is immune to biases on the inner rc shape .",
    "this apparent conflict between cdm theory and observations in these and other systems has been called the `` cusp / core problem '' .    among experiments that probe the structure of galactic halos , substantial resources",
    "have been devoted to deriving inner dark matter halo shapes for dwarf and low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies .",
    "although in some systems the rc features correlate with those seen in the light distribution ( sancisi 2004 ) , the global rc dynamics in dwarf and lsb galaxies are thought to be dark matter dominated even at small @xmath12 ( e.g. swaters 1999 ) .",
    "the advantage in inferring their halo properties from observed gas dynamics is therefore twofold : first , there may be little contribution to the observed rc from baryonic components , in which case the rc shape is a direct manifestation of the inner halo structure .",
    "second , baryonic collapse in the halo gravipotential well during disk formation may not significantly alter the halo structure .",
    "the halos of dwarf and lsb galaxies may therefore represent pristine , pre - baryon collapse distributions better suited to direct comparisons with collisionless cdm simulations than the halos of more massive or luminous systems .",
    "early observations of dwarf and lsb kinematics from synthesis observations ( e.g. carignan & beaulieu 1989 ; ct et al .",
    "1991 ; de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) yielded rcs that are well - described by models with cores rather than cusps . this apparent crisis for cdm ( e.g. flores & primack 1994 ; moore 1994 ) has since been called into question , however , because beam smearing caused by limited spatial resolution in the inner halo systematically lowers the measured inner profile slopes ( blais - ouellette et al . 1999 , 2004 ;",
    "swaters 1999 ; swaters et al .",
    "2000 ; van den bosch et al .",
    "2000 ; van den bosch & swaters 2001 ; but see gentile et al .",
    "2004 ) . alternatively , long - slit optical spectroscopy yields arcsecond - resolution rcs in relatively short integration times .",
    "there has therefore been a concerted effort to obtain long - slit spectra for many dwarf and lsb systems ( e.g. borriello & salucci 2001 ; de blok et al .",
    "2001 , hereafter db01 ; mcgaugh et al . 2001",
    "; de blok & bosma 2002 ; marchesini et al .",
    "2002 ; swaters et al . 2003 , hereafter s03 ) . a full characterization of the kinematics",
    "is then achieved by combining the resulting high resolution rcs with measurements of the outer rc shape in ( e.g. de blok et al .",
    "2001 ; marchesini et al . 2002 ; s03 ; gentile et al .",
    "approximately 70 high - quality rcs have been obtained from these studies , and almost all are better described by cores than the cusps predicted by cdm .",
    "these data are clearly consistent with halos having cores rather than cusps ; nonetheless , mass models of hybrid h@xmath19 + rcs often can not rule out the @xmath16 case ( s03 , hayashi et al . 2004 ) .",
    "many studies have focused on a simpler measure of @xmath4 from long - slit spectra alone , in which the stellar mass is ignored and spherical symmetry is assumed ( db01 ; de blok et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter db03 ; s03 ) .",
    "this is clearly an over - simplification of the problem ( e.g. fall & efstathiou 1980 ; salucci 2001 ) , but one that produces meaningful results : minimum disks yield upper limits on the true steepness of the halo profile , and there is typically little change in the halo slope when a luminous component is introduced ( db01 , de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) .",
    "this technique , too , has revealed mostly core - like @xmath4 .",
    "however , even at arcsecond resolution a variety of observational uncertainties such as slit offsets , slit width and seeing , and geometric effects such as galaxy inclination all lead to an underestimate of @xmath4 relative to the underlying @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , inner halo shapes are measured in the region where rcs are most susceptible to folding errors , and where the relative uncertainties on the rc points are largest . as a result , raw long - slit spectra",
    "are heavily processed before the inner halo shapes are estimated , and this may also lead to a bias in the measured slopes .",
    "indeed , the complexity of the exercise is illustrated by the significant differences in @xmath4 sometimes inferred by different authors for the same galaxies , even when the same raw spectra are used ( db03 ; s03 ) . to meaningfully compare the @xmath4 obtained to the cuspy @xmath5 predicted by cdm , then , a thorough assessment of these potential biases is required .",
    "however , there is no clear consensus among those who have undertaken this task .",
    "the simulations of db03 indicate that no single systematic effect can reconcile their data with cuspy cdm halos , but those of s03 and rhee et al .",
    "( 2004 ) lead them to conclude that a range @xmath20 is consistent with the @xmath4 derived .",
    "with the present body of data , it is therefore unclear whether the halo shapes measured in this manner signal a genuine conflict for the cdm paradigm , or whether they can be reconciled by taking observing and data reduction techniques into account . in the present paper",
    "we address this issue by deriving @xmath4 for 165 low - mass galaxies under assumptions of spherical symmetry and a minimal disk , using techniques similar to those of db01 , db03 and s03 .",
    "we then perform simulations to determine the impact of the observing and data processing methods on our results .",
    "the size , homogeneity , and parameter space probed by the sample allow for both an independent measurement of the distribution of @xmath4 in low - mass systems and a thorough investigation of the potential biases on the @xmath4 values obtained .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : our sample selection criteria are given in ",
    "[ sample ] , and our analysis of the sample rcs and the values of @xmath4 obtained are in   [ inversion ] .",
    "the simulations we perform to compare the distribution of @xmath4 with those expected for model galaxies with various @xmath5 are described in   [ simulations ] , and we compare our simulation results to the sample data in ",
    "[ results ] . a summary of our findings as well as",
    "a list of caveats regarding the accurate determination of inner halo shapes is in  6 .",
    "the dwarf galaxy sample is selected from the sfi++ tully - fisher database maintained at cornell university , a compilation of @xmath214800 galaxies with accurate i - band photometry and estimates of rotational velocity @xmath22 from either single - dish or optical long - slit spectra .",

    "2003 ) , and fall systematically below the tully - fisher relation ( kannappan et al .",
    "we then examine the optical and i - band emission of each of these candidates , and discard those with distorted morphologies such as strong warps or other irregularities .",

    "finally , we discard systems for which the inner rc points do not yield a reliable estimate of the inner halo density because of asymmetries , undersampling , or other distortions , yielding a sample of 165 systems .    in principle",
    ", one could verify the assumption of a minimum disk by producing multi - component mass models to assess potential contributions of the disk and the bulge to the observed rcs .",
    "this is impractical for the present sample , however , because the outer halo shapes ( and hence their contribution to the observed rcs ) are largely unconstrained by the optical rcs alone .",

    "however , the normalization of that distribution may vary by factors of a few given the uncertainties in the stellar mass - to - light ratio ( e.g bell & de jong 2001 ) , and for this sample the degeneracy between stellar and halo contributions is exacerbated by the lack of outer halo constraints .",

    "a comparison with previous studies deriving @xmath4 via the minimum disk assumption ( db03 ; s03 ) is not straightforward , as a conversion from the b- or r - band values listed in these papers is required . adopting a canonical conversion of b - i=0.5 , however , most of the galaxies of s03 fall within the peak of the @xmath26 distribution in fig .",

    "<S> we derive inner dark matter halo density profiles for a sample of 165 low - mass galaxies using rotation curves obtained from high - quality , long - slit optical spectra assuming minimal disks and spherical symmetry . for @xmath0 near the galaxy center we measure median inner slopes ranging from @xmath1 to @xmath2 for various subsamples of the data . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to values found by other authors and in stark contrast to the intrinsic cusps ( @xmath3 ) predicted by simulations of halo assembly in cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmologies . to elucidate the relationship between @xmath4 and @xmath5 in our data , </S>",
    "<S> we simulate long - slit observations of model galaxies with halo shapes broadly consistent with the cdm paradigm . </S>",
    "<S> simulations with @xmath6 and 1 recover both the observed distribution of @xmath4 and correlations between @xmath4 and primary observational parameters such as distance and disk inclination , whereas those with @xmath7 are marginally consistent with the data . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , the hypothesis that low - mass galaxies have @xmath8 is rejected . while the simulations do not imply that the data favor intrinsic cusps over cores , they demonstrate that the discrepancy between @xmath4 and @xmath3 for our sample does not necessarily imply a genuine conflict between our results and cdm predictions : rather , the apparent cusp / core problem may be reconciled by considering the impact of observing and data processing techniques on rotation curves derived from long - slit spectra . </S>"
