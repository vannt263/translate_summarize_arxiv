    "recently , heavy fermion superconductivity was discovered at 1.85 @xmath6 in the skutterudite compound pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 with a cubic ( tetrahedral ) crystal symmetry t@xmath2@xcite .",
    "intriguingly , it was indicated that there are multiple superconducting phases in this material , like in the uranium compounds@xcite .",
    "two specific heat jumps were observed at @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the absence of the magnetic field@xcite .",
    "moreover , the thermal conductivity measurement in a magnetic field rotated relative to the crystal axes reveals a novel change in the symmetry of the gap function in the @xmath9-plane@xcite .",
    "the result was that the gap function has four point - node - like structure ( four dips ) in the [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] directions on the fermi surface in the high field and high temperature region ( a - phase ) , and two dips in the [ 010 ] direction in the low field and low temperature region ( b - phase ) .",
    "the proposed phase diagram is given in fig .",
    "[ phase - diagram ] .",
    "unfortunately , the gap structure along the @xmath10-axis remains unresolved within in the presently available data@xcite , and one of the purpose of this paper is to consider this problem .",
    "the presence of the point node like structures appears to be consistent with the power law behavior of the specific heat@xcite and the nuclear - spin - lattice relaxation@xcite at low temperatures ( see also ref .",
    "another evidence for the double superconducting transition is the thermal expansion measurement along [ 100 ] direction@xcite ; two clear jumps are observed at around @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the absence of the magnetic field ( fig .",
    "[ phase - diagram ] ) .    in this paper , the symmetry of the gap functions for a- and b - phase are discussed by use of a phenomenological ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory@xcite based on the tetrahedral crystal symmetry t@xmath2 . at present , there are no information as to whether the superconductivity is spin singlet or spin triplet pairing . only the singlet pairing case will be discussed in this paper . the gap structure along the @xmath10-axis is considered .",
    "we find that the gap function appears to have two additional dips along the @xmath10-axis in a - phase ( in total there are six dips , along the [ 100 ] , [ 010 ] and [ 001 ] directions ) , while no additional dips are inferred for the b - phase resulting in a toal of two dips , along the [ 010 ] direction ) .",
    "the a - phase gap is essentially an `` anisotropic @xmath3-wave '' state and the b - phase gap is an `` anisotropic @xmath11-wave '' state .",
    "the b - phase gap breaks the cubic crystal symmetry and time reversal symmetry spontaneously , from which one can expect a crystal deformation with cubic symmetry breaking to occur in this phase . to verify this ,",
    "the phenomenological strain - order parameter coupling is taken into account and the thermal expansions and isothermal elastic constants are calculated@xcite .",
    "one finds that these values become anisotropic in b - phase .",
    "i. a rough sketch of the phase diagram proposed by izawa et .",
    "see , also refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "[ phase - diagram ]    the pairing mechanism for this superconductivity should be also interesting .",
    "it is widely believed that the mechanism for the heavy fermion superconductivity in the uranium compounds comes from magnetic interactions , but pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 is a non - magnetic compound .",
    "several experiments indicate that the ground state of pr @xmath12-electrons in the crystalline electric field would most likely be the non - kramers doublet @xmath13 state@xcite .",
    "the @xmath13 ground state has quadrupolar fluctuations and its relations to the heavy fermion behavior@xcite and also to a pairing mechanism seems to be possible to discuss .",
    "however , its relation to the pairing symmetry , which will be focused in this paper , is unclear at present .",
    "moreover , the singlet @xmath14 state without quadrupolar fluctuations is also proposed as the ground state@xcite .",
    "the details of the pairing mechanism will not be discussed here .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , the gap structures for the a- and b - phases are discussed . in section iii ,",
    "jumps of the specific heat at two transition points ( t@xmath15 and t@xmath16 ) are calculated . to fit these calculations to the specific heat measurement@xcite , one obtains information for the coefficients of the fourth order terms in the gl potential . in section iv ,",
    "arguments for a spontaneous cubic symmetry breaking in the b - phase are presented , and a summary is given in section v.",
    "in this section , the gap structures for the a- and b - phases in the spin singlet pairing case are discussed within the frameork of the phenomenological gl theory .",
    "information on the gap structure along the @xmath10-axis , which is still unresolved by the thermal conductivity measurement@xcite , are obtained .    the gl theory to be considered",
    "is based on the cubic crystal symmetry group t@xmath2 .",
    "this group has essentially three irreducible representations a@xmath17 ( @xmath14 ) , e ( @xmath18 ) and t ( @xmath19 ) .      in this phase , four point - node - like ( four - dip ) structures of the gap function located within the @xmath9-plane",
    "are observed along the [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] directions @xcite .",
    "then , the question is whether the gap function has two additional dips along @xmath10-axis ( i.e. the gap has a total of six dips ) or not ( i.e. four dips in all ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that h@xmath16 is isotropic in this superconductor@xcite . in general , the superconducting states represented by a multicomponent order parameter should have an anisotropic h@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the gap function in the a - phase appears to be represented by a single component order parameter , i.e. , the a@xmath17 representation .",
    "the gap function with six dips along the [ 100 ] , [ 010 ] and [ 001 ] directions belongs to the a@xmath17 representation because this structure has the cubic symmetry t@xmath2 .",
    "actually , one can see this as follows .",
    "let @xmath20 and @xmath21 stand for the order parameter and the basis function of the a@xmath17 representation , respectively . by the definition , @xmath21 should be invariant under t@xmath2 .",
    "the gap function in this representation is @xmath22 the six - dip state can be represented by using invariants@xcite : @xmath23 and also @xmath24 @xmath25 etc .",

    "when one takes @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ 6p1 ] ) ( @xmath27 in eq .",

    "_ it should be noted that the function @xmath21 which can give rise to six dips is not limited to these two forms .",
    "_ there are many possible forms which have six dips .",
    "the point is that the six - dip state can be described in the a@xmath17 representation and essentially categorized into the so - called `` anisotropic @xmath3-wave '' state .",
    "the four - dip state does not belong to the a@xmath17 representation because this gap structure does not have the cubic symmetry .",
    "actually , one would see in the next subsection that this state belongs to the a@xmath29e combined representation@xcite .",
    "then , a multicomponent orderparameter is needed to describe this gap function ( see , eq .",
    "( [ a+e ] ) ) , and in general , an anisotropy in @xmath30 is to be expected@xcite . in contradiction to the experimental result@xcite .",
    "moreover , in the next subsection one would see that the four - dip structure arises in a somewhat accidental way ( see , eq .",
    "( [ 4p ] ) ) .",
    "then , in the a - phase , it seems to be natural to consider that the six - dip state ( strongly anisotropic @xmath3-wave state ) is realized .      in this phase ,",
    "two dips of the gap function within in @xmath9-plane along [ 010 ] direction are observed@xcite .",
    "then , the question is whether the gap function has two additional dips along the @xmath10-axis ( i.e. the gap has in total four dips ) or not ( i.e. a total of two dips ) .",
    "phase transitions are observed by varying @xmath31 and also varying @xmath32 without a magnetic field turned on ( fig .",
    "[ phase - diagram ] ) . to describe the phase transition without external fields",
    ", one can consider the combined representations .",
    "possible combinations in the present case are a@xmath29e , a@xmath29 t , e@xmath33 t , and a@xmath29 e @xmath33 t.    as we will see below , both the four - dip and two - dip states belong to the a@xmath29 e representation .",
    "let @xmath34 and @xmath35 stand for the effective coupling constant of the pairing interaction for the a@xmath17 channel and the e channel , respectively .",
    "in general , these values are split by the crystal field . the a@xmath29 e combined state",
    "is realized when@xcite @xmath36 is satisfied .",
    "this comes from some accidental degeneracy .",
    "the gap function in a@xmath29 e model is expanded by the basis functions of a@xmath17 and e representations : @xmath37 the function @xmath38 is the first component of the 2d basis of the e representation which transforms like the function @xmath39 under the t@xmath2 group .",

    "it has two line nodes crossing at two points along the [ 010 ] direction .",
    "note that these functions may include terms beyond quadratic order in the momentum @xmath43 .",
    "however the nodal structure of these basis functions remain unaltered , in general , even if the higher order terms are included .    to obtain a four - dip state along the [ 010 ] and [ 001 ] directions",
    ", one must fine - tune the three basis functions into the particular forms @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , where the second order terms of @xmath43 are absent , and also the three order parameters are fixed to take the particular values @xcite @xmath47 this looks highly accidental . the gap function with four dips along [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] directions discussed in the previous subsection",
    "can also be obtained in the same manner@xcite .",
    "two - dip state is realized when @xmath48 because @xmath49 is zero and @xmath21 becomes minimum along [ 010 ] direction .",
    "note that the two - dip structure appears generically for all values of the two parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "moreover , it is not necessary to fix the basal functions @xmath21 , @xmath52 and @xmath49 to particular forms .",
    "the only assumption needed here is the six - dip structure of the function @xmath21 .",
    "it should be noted again that the function @xmath21 is not limited to a particular form to obtain six dips .",
