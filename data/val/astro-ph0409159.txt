    "one of the interesting subject in astroparticle physics is the understanding of the origin and the composition of the energy spectrum of ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhe ) that exceed @xmath7 ev . these uhecr are just near the so called gzk cut - off opacity due to cosmic black body radiation .",
    "these uhecr should be also source of secondary neutrinos by photopion production made by gzk cut - off .",
    "many experiments detect neutrinos by looking for showers or tracks from charged leptons produced by charged current interaction of neutrinos of @xmath8 ev . at present time",
    "there are several measurements of cosmic ray flux made with several techniques @xcite .",
    "next generation experiment above @xmath9 ev is sensitive to neutrinos typically from the near horizontal air - showers .",
    "these projects include the southern site of pierre auger observatory able to detect by photo - luminescent lights along the horizontal showers ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "recently several authors have pointed the interest to the horizontal showers produced by the interaction of ultra high energy ( uhe ) neutrinos on the earth crust @xcite .",
    "a measurement of horizontal showers provides a test of the gzk model as an indirect constraints of the ultra - high energy neutrino fluxes @xcite .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] shows the neutrino fluxes per flavour as predicted by top - down model with p=1 and @xmath11gev/@xmath12 and compared to future experimental sensitivity , @xcite .",
    "uptaus ( lower bound on the center ) and hortaus ( right parabolic curves ) sensibility at different observer heights h ( @xmath13 ) for a present neutrino flux estimate in z - shower ( z - burst ) model scenario @xcite , @xcite , for light ( @xmath14 ev ) neutrino masses @xmath15 ; two corresponding density contrast has been assumed @xcite ; the lower parabolic bound thresholds are at different operation height , in horizontal ( crown ) detector @xcite facing toward most distant horizons edge ; we are assuming a duration of data records of a decade comparable to the batse record data ( a decade ) .",
    "the parabolic bounds on the eev energy range in the right sides are nearly un - screened by the earth opacity while the corresponding uptaus bounds in the center below suffer both of earth opacity as well as of a consequent shorter tau interaction lenght in earth crust , that has been taken into account .",
    "all present estimate are found for the earth crust made of water ; for the rock present bounds are lowered and sharper by nearly a factor @xmath16 @xcite . ]    in this paper we present a prototype module designed to detect horizontal cosmic ray flux and we show the test results obtained in laboratory for a single module as for two modules .",
    "we discuss also a possible engineering array to reach a sensitivity of the order of @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "the basic idea is to measure the flux of particles from a shower produced horizontally in the atmosphere by the interaction of ultra high energy ( uhe ) neutrinos on the earth s crust .",
    "the air shower is a complex chain of interactions resulting in a large number of particles .",
    "the predicted transverse length of the shower at ground level should be about @xmath19 . the best solution to detect muons produced by horizontal air shower consists in assembling several detectors pointing the horizon from the top of a mountain in an large surface array .",
    "a good time correlation of the signals of about 20 ns provides the time structure of muonic showers and a time resolution along the shower propagation of about 1 ns provides the background rejection as discussed in next section .",
    "the array will be discussed in section [ sec : array ] .",
    "the elementary module , called `` tower '' throughout this paper , tested is composed by three tiles of bicron scintillator of 12.5 @xmath20 12.5 @xmath21 and @xmath22 of thickness put parallel in a frame shown in fig.[fig : scheme2 ] .",
    "the three tiles in the paper are called c1 , c2 and c3 and they are apart between them @xmath23 .",
    "two of them , c1 and c2 , located at @xmath24 coordinate equal @xmath25 and @xmath24 coordinate equal @xmath26 respectively , are used to define the electronic coincidence ; the third tile , located between them , is used to study and to remove the background .",
    "the distance of the centers of the tiles can be varied from @xmath22 to @xmath27 .",
    "the scintillators are read by a hamamatsu photo - multiplier coupled to the scintillator by an optical connector .",
    "the pm has a transit time spread of less than @xmath28 and a low - voltage power supply .",
    "this choice requires a simple power supply system . to measure horizontal cosmic ray flux we need know the time arrow , i.e. select the muons from the horizon and remove particles from other directions . that requires the measurement of the time of flight between two tiles ( c1,c2 ) .",
    "the results shown were performed with a setup where the distance between c1 and c2 was @xmath26 and the data were taken at different zenith angles and at ground level .",
    "one test was performed also with the c3 tile to understand the backgroud .",
    "the measurement of a cosmic particle passing through two tiles distant @xmath29 is affected by three kinds of background :    * \\a ) a pair of different particles cross at the same time the two tiles ( c1,c2 ) . *",
    "\\b ) a particle crosses one tile and the noise of second tile gives a coincidence * \\c ) two particles from different mini - showers cross the first ( c1 ) and 3rd ( c2 ) tile at different time .    the background a ) can be removed by a good timing : @xmath30 ; the background b ) can be removed appling a cut on the charge deposited into the scintillators ; the background c ) must be evaluated and it can not be removed .",
    "that defines our response in term of signal@xmath31noise .",
    "we calibrated the detector using @xmath32 and @xmath33 radioactive sources and the cosmic rays . for @xmath32 and @xmath33",
    "we used the end - point of the spectrum , even for @xmath33 , because of the poor energy resolution ; for cosmic rays we assumed mimimum ionization particles and changed the mean crossing length altering the angle of the central tile with the others , from parallel ( @xmath34 ) to orthogonal ( @xmath35 , corresponding to @xmath36 path length in the scintillator ) .",
    "fig.[fig : calib ] shows the charge deposited into the scintillator as function of the energy lost .    to isolate the particle crossing orthogonal the detector we registered a sample of cosmic rays with the detector positioned at zenith angle equal @xmath37 degrees . analyzing the charge deposited into the scintillator we found a set of cuts to define a particle crossing the detector within a solid angle of @xmath38 .",
    "the sample of events selected by these cuts is still contaminated by a background of type a ) , described above .",
    "the time of flight and the information of the energy deposited in c2 will remove this contribution .",
    "fig.[fig : adc1vs2 ] shows the charge deposited into tile c1 and c2 by a vertical muon of energy greater than 1 @xmath39 . the poor energy resolution is due to the light collection method : to enhance our time resolution we decided to remove any light yield enhancement technique and take only the light that travels on a straight line , from the interaction point to the photocathode ;",
    "more precisely , we observed that any further reflection is harmful for time resolution , so we decided to loose the energy resolution to make direct light collection dominant .",
    "the charge of vertical equivalent muon ( cvem ) , as discussed before , is used to define a set of cuts ( @xmath40 2.5 nc around the average deposited charge ) to select horizontal charged tracks .",
    "it also let us remove events falling in regions of the scintillator affected by a large time spread in light collection , giving us an enhancement in time resolution ; this has been proved by testing the light collection time uniformity of a single tile , by coincidence with a thin plastic scintillator of signals from a @xmath32 source .      to evaluate the time resolution of the apparatus we put the centers of two tiles at a distance of @xmath41 .",
    "the distribution obtained , shown in fig.[fig : tres ] , has a @xmath42 .",
    "then an event with @xmath43 is not a single track passing through c1 and c2 .",
    "fig.[fig : horiz1 ] shows the time response when the detector is at zenith angle equal @xmath37 ( yellow ) .",
    "being the distance between the centers of the two tiles @xmath26 the time of flight is @xmath44 ns . the distribution with the detector oriented at zenith equal @xmath45 is also plotted ( blue ) .",
    "the peaks at @xmath46 correspond to horizontal tracks crossing c1 then c2 or viceversa .",
    "the events at @xmath47 are generated by two tracks that cross at the same instant the two tiles .",
    "the results of about 400 hours live time recorded at lowest of a four floor building are summarized in table [ tab : meas ] . at that place",
    "we are screened by most of the direct gamma shower secondaries in open air .",
    ".[tab : meas ] cosmic ray flux measured by one unit only;@xmath48 the detector is located at @xmath23 of floor level e - w direction ; @xmath49 for these measurements the setup is show in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] and described in the text [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in table [ tab : meas ] is evaluated the intensity of muon as function of zenith angle corrected by detector efficiency .",
    "the last six raw give the results obtained pointing the detector to a step of concrete as shown in fig.7 .",
    "the step drawn on right side ( south - west ) of the layout permits to the muons at large zenith angle ( greater than 88 degrees ) cross at least 50 m of concrete . on the left side ( north )",
    "muons cross the detector at angle smaller than 85 degrees directly from the atmosphere .",
    "the measured difference of the muon flux from north and from south corresponds to about 100 m water equivalent .",
    "fig.[fig : horiz3 ] shows the c1-c2 time difference ( blue histogram ) for zenith angle 88.8@xmath50 - 81.6@xmath50 .",
    "yellow histogram is obtained with the detector at zenith equal @xmath37 .",
    "the measured difference of factor 2 in flux is due to the change of acceptance .",
    "fig.[fig : horiz4]a shows the results with the detector at zenith angle equal to 75.5@xmath50 - 81.8@xmath50 . at this angle the cosmic rays hit before c1 tile than c2 tile hence the time difference defined @xmath51 is negative . the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : horiz4]b shows the adc counts of the c3 tile located between c1 and c2 versus the @xmath51 . by this plot",
    "we estimate an upper limit to background ( type c , cfr . [ sec : backgr ] ) of order of @xmath52 for each module .",
    "the results of table 1 are plotted in fig.[fig : graph1 ] .",
    "plot of the results ( red points ) from table 1 in the interval 0@xmath50,90@xmath50 degrees ; other data are from @xcite ]     setup to measure the effect on the muon flux induced by a step of concrete ]",
    "to study the background and optimize the distance of c1 and c2 tile we have inserted a second module in the trigger gate .",
    "we recorded the adc counts and the tdc signals from the two modules set at zenith @xmath37 and located at distance @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the rate of two particles crossing vertically both modules , distant @xmath53 , in the trigger gate was 3.7 @xmath56 hz . no events were found when the second module was set vertically at distance @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "these measurements tell us no background from vertical is present when the tiles are @xmath26 distant or more .      to complete these tests ,",
    "due to the fact our detector works horizontally , we performed the same measurement with the two modules at zenith angle @xmath45 and set parallel at distance of @xmath57 . in this setup",
    "we have measured a rate of 1.5 @xmath56 hz of events when one track crosses one module and _ only _ one tile of the second module was hit by another track at the same time .",
    "the two modules were set at a distance of @xmath58 running for @xmath59 s ( 20 days ) to estimate the background upper limit . during this data taking",
    "we did not see events , then the sensitivity is @xmath17 @xmath60 , being our gate of about @xmath61 , in agreement with muon bundles flux reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "the @xmath62 of the events recorded by each module can be obtained using clear fibers connected to the tiles and transporting a pulse of monochromatic laser light .",
    "fig.[fig : calib3 ] shows the setup used to evaluate the time resolution with two modules 300 m apart .",
    "it results to be less that 10 ns .",
    "the measurement of the time of the signal transmitted from the pm to the daq is evaluated recording the arrival time and subtracting the time spent by the pulse to reach each tile : the time resolution results to be less than 10 ns .",
    "setup to measure the resolution on @xmath62 ]    the flux detection limit can be estimated by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the number of the events . @xmath65 the live time , @xmath66 the effective surface observed by the detector , @xmath67 the solid angle and @xmath68 the neutrino efficiency conversion . neglecting the energy dependence of @xmath66 and assuming , for simplicity , @xmath69 for earth skimmed events",
    ", we obtain a detector sensitivity , for frontal showers originated at about @xmath70 , of 1.7 events / year with a flux of @xmath71 and a total detector live surface of @xmath72 .",
    "this is actually an upper limit because of neglected geometrical and physical effects determined by the actual _ in situ _ configuration and has to be interpreted as a fraction of the total flux , limited to earth skimmed events ; it gives , for a @xmath73 observer , a corresponding sensitivity of about @xmath74 , obtained by rescaling for the ratio @xmath75 , that estimates a correction for the assumption of frontal showers .",
    "the assumption that @xmath72 of live surface is enough to achive this level of discrimination is based on phenomenological studies @xcite .",
    "in conclusion the background measured for a single module is sufficient for a reliable detection of muons from horizontal showers if the distance of the tiles is between @xmath26 to @xmath76 .",
    "this setup permits also to have a detector sensitivity of @xmath74 , by an array with a live surface of @xmath77 . at this flux level",
    "the tau - air showers by gzk neutrinos might be already able to pollute above the atmospheric muon fluxes @xcite .",
    "therefore a small size array at top of the mountains would be able to reach neutrino astronomy at minimal guaranteed gzk fluence .",
