    "modern low frequency ( @xmath0  mhz ) radio telescopes consist of dozens to thousands of low gain antennas , the outputs of which are typically digitized so beamforming and imaging may be performed in the digital domain . in these telescopes ,",
    "each individual antenna is integrated with a front end , which typically performs amplification , filtering , impedance transformation , and differential to single - ended ( i.e. balanced to unbalanced ) conversion .",
    "the front end must be sensitive to astrophysical signals , but must also be sufficiently linear to be robust to external interference . thus there exists a trade off between sensitivity and linearity .",
    "in this paper we present front end design methodologies which consider sensitivity and linearity jointly .",

    "we designed amplifiers using pga-103s in ( 1 ) a balanced configuration and in ( 2 ) parallel configuration of balanced amplifiers in order to improve the linearity of the single - ended pga-103 .",
    "a front end using two hela-10 amplifiers with input filtering was designed to demonstrate a front end with the highest reported linearity in a modern radio telescope .",

    "as in any other frequency regime , the sensitivity of a low frequency radio telescope is determined primarily by collecting area and noise . however the extraordinarily high sky brightness temperature at low frequencies leads to somewhat different considerations in design criteria and subsequent characterization of instruments .    a model for characterizing the sensitivity - limiting noise delivered to the digitizer in a low frequency instrument",

    "the effect of impedance mismatch may be taken into account by defining a two - port circuit , identified as an `` antenna interface '' ( ai ) in fig .",
    "[ lfa_fnoisemodel ] , which connects the antenna to the rest of the receiver .",

    "the psd subsequently delivered to the digitizer is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the gain of the receiver and the second term accounts for the noise contribution from the receiver , expressed as the input - referred equivalent noise temperature @xmath1 .",
    "front ends in low frequency radio telescopes are not typically noise - matched to the antenna .",
    "antenna impedance in these instruments varies dramatically , so the front end input impedance is typically not equal to the value that would yield optimal noise figure . as a consequence , the minimum possible",

    "[ eqn : stopcrit ] ) .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ eqn : sr ] ) is exact only if @xmath1 is determined for the _ in situ _ input impedance , as opposed to using the value associated with the vendor - specified impedance ; but the effect on the results presented here is expected to be small since the mismatch with the antenna impedance remains large .",
    "@xmath10 is comprised of naturally - occurring contributions @xmath29 from the sky and @xmath30 from the ground , plus noise associated with interference . interfering noise originates from human activity and from natural events including lightning and solar bursts  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to deliberate man - made signals , man - made noise below 300  mhz is normally negligible compared to naturally - occurring noise in the rural locations where radio telescopes are typically built .",
    "naturally - occurring interference is intermittent and negligible most of the time , so the resulting antenna temperature can be expressed as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is ground loss efficiency .",
    "this efficiency accounts for near - field coupling between the antenna and the ground that results in loss in the ground manifesting as loss in the antenna itself .",
    "typical values of @xmath32 range from about @xmath33 ( typical at 38  mhz above untreated earth without a conducting ground screen @xcite ) to very close to 1 ( typical above 100  mhz or with a sufficiently large ground screen , as in the demonstration in section  [ sec : demo ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath30 is significantly affected by the ground screen . for a perfectly - conducting infinite ground screen , the apparent brightness of the ground is about equal to the apparent brightness of the sky , due to reflection . for no ground screen @xmath34150  k , i.e. , @xmath35300  k corresponding to the physical temperature of the ground divided by 2 since roughly half of the antenna pattern intersects the ground . for the small ( @xmath36 $ ] in area ) ground screens typically used in modern instruments ,",
    "the actual value of @xmath30 is somewhere between these two extremes ( for example , we obtain a value of 390  k at 45  mhz for the field experiment conducted in section  [ sec : demo ] ) .",
    "@xmath29 in this frequency regime is dominated by the very bright galactic synchrotron background .",
    "the brightness temperature of this background is somewhat brighter in the galactic plane and somewhat dimmer in the galactic polar regions , however the total contribution to the antenna temperature of a low - gain antenna isolated from ground loss is well - approximated as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is frequency .",
