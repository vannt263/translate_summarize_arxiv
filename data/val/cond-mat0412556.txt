    "imada@xcite studied appropriate hubbard model on the triangular lattice and found an insulating regime with no spin order .",
    "the ring exchange spin model can be viewed as derived from the hubbard model by a projective transformation , which is appropriate in the presence of the charge gap .",
    "the present work attempts to understand possible spin liquid states in the ring exchange model by examining candidate ground state wave functions .",

    "the question of possible spin liquid states is taken up here by considering variational spin liquid wave functions on the triangular lattice .",

    "more specifically , ansatze with anisotropic extended @xmath20-wave , @xmath21 , and @xmath14 pairing patterns have very close optimal energies and much lower than the energy of the trial af state . unfortunately , we conclude that the present study is not sufficient to address the nature of the spin liquid in this regime , which we indicate with question marks in the figure .",
    "our observation that the improvement in the trial energy is little sensitive to the specific pairing pattern may be an indication that the present restricted study can not access the correct ground state in this regime .",

    "we have a fermi surface of spinons , and therefore expect no spin gap and finite spin susceptibility down to zero temperature consistent with the experimental observations .",

    "we then vary the parameters to optimize the trial energy .",
    "we want to compare the ring exchange energetics of the spin liquid states with the energetics of the antiferromagnetically ordered states . for this purpose",

    "our primary goal here is to see how the af state is disfavored by the ring exchanges . since we are comparing with rather different states and are looking for the energy level crossing",

    ".   should be sufficient to get rough idea of the ring exchange energetics in the af state . for details on these wave functions and numerical evaluations ,",

    "this may be an indication of an instability towards a state that can not be captured in the context of the trial fermionic states .",
    "the situation is particularly inconclusive close to the af phase , where several other trial states have competitive energies .    in summary",
    ", we find that ring exchanges disfavor the af ordered state compared with the fermionic spin liquid states , but our study is not conclusive as to which spin liquid state is realized when the transition happens .",

    "our generalization of the exchange operators preserves the character of moving spins around a ring . for @xmath48 ,",

    "( [ hring ] ) with @xmath49 a similar large @xmath29 formulation was considered in a different context in ref .  .",
    "we also remark here that the general @xmath29 formulation allows nontrivial exchanges involving three spins .",

    "the three - spin exchanges can be easily included in the following analysis ; to stay in line with the rest of the paper , we only consider the two - spin and four - spin exchanges .",
    "we formulate the large @xmath29 procedure in the spirit of the variational approach .",

    "we first make some general observations about this procedure .",
    "first of all , note that the self - consistency conditions imply that the optimal state can have non - zero @xmath41 only on the bonds that have non - zero @xmath59 or that appear in some ring exchange placket . for the triangular lattice model studied here",
    ", we then have to consider only nearest - neighbor @xmath41 .",
    "second , we see quite generally that the ring exchange contribution for a given placket has the form @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the geometric mean of the absolute values of @xmath62 around the placket , while @xmath63 is the `` flux '' of the corresponding phase factors . thus , the positive ring exchange wants to smear the fermions over the lattice with no fluxes .    to be more precise ,",
    "let us consider several simple trial states .",
    "state has flux @xmath64 through each triangle .",
    "the expectation values @xmath65 have the same pattern of fluxes as the input @xmath41 , and the trial energy per site is @xmath66 since the flux through each rhombus is @xmath67 . among such flux states , we find that for @xmath68 the best state has through each placket ( this state has the largest @xmath69 ) , while for @xmath70 the best state has the numerical values of the energy per site in the two states can be obtained from @xmath71 for large enough @xmath72 the zero - flux state is stable against adding small flux @xmath64 because @xmath73 .",
    "we also considered so called states such that non - zero @xmath41 form nonoverlapping dimer covering of the lattice .",
    "these states break translational invariance , and any dimer covering produces such a state .",
    "it is well known that these states can have lower heisenberg exchange energy in the large @xmath29 limit .",
    "this is because the occupied bonds attain the maximal expectation value @xmath74 and their contribution can be sufficient to produce the lowest total energy .",
    "the energy per site in any dimer state is @xmath75 and is indeed the lowest energy for @xmath76 .",
    "however , the dimer states gain no ring exchange energy , and for @xmath77 the zero flux state becomes the lowest energy state . finally , the so called states have identical two - spin exchange energy with the dimer states but also nontrivial fluxes and therefore do not enter the competition for the ground state for @xmath78 .",
    "we performed full optimization over @xmath41 of the mean field energy considering possible unit cells with up to four sites , and found that the above simple states are indeed sufficient to describe the ground state in the large @xmath29 limit : the optimal state is one of the dimer states for @xmath79 and becomes the zero flux state for larger @xmath80 . the complete study is summarized in fig .",

    "@xcite the measured spin correlations in the projected wave function represent some puzzle in this respect : ref .   predicts that the spin structure factor is singularly enhanced near @xmath89 in the spinon - gauge system .",
    "we find that in the projected wave function the structure factor remains finite throughout the brillouin zone and that the overall rate of decay of spin correlations is roughly the same as in the free fermion state .",
    "one possible source of this difference is that the projected wave function has fixed @xmath41 and therefore does not include the fluctuations of the spatial components of the gauge field ; only the temporal component is `` included '' by the projection .",
