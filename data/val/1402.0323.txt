    "deeply virtual compton scattering , both in its spacelike and timelike realizations , is the golden channel to extract gpds from measurements . using model - dependent evaluations we have demonstrated here , in the case of medium energy kinematics which will be explored in the near future at jlab and compass , that the inclusion of nlo corrections to the coefficient function could be an important issue .",
    "the difference of these corrections between the spacelike and timelike regimes is so sizable that they can be promoted to the status of direct tests of the qcd understanding of the reactions . considering cff fitting , global fits of dvcs and tcs data will be needed to separate quark and gluon contributions and allow an accurate interpretation of extracted data .    finally , let us emphasize that we do not consider as a weakness of the current physics program the apparent importance of nlo contributions to compton form factors and dvcs or tcs observables . although it certainly opens the way to a challenging verification that nnlo corrections are either under control or subject to a legitimate resummation procedure @xcite , it points to the very positive fact that the compass - ii and jlab12 experiments may constrain gluon gpds . the 3d tomography of the gluonic structure of the nucleon may thus be scrutinized through the @xmath29-dependence of compton form factors extracted from near future experimental data ."
