    "the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) will presumably be revealed in the coming years through a combination of lhc and ilc data .",
    "it is expected that embedded in the newly discovered physics will be an explanation of how this mechanism remains stable under quantum corrections . until this time , it is vital that we study the different known field theoretical mechanisms of ewsb that stabilize the higgs potential .",
    "the little higgs mechanism  @xcite is a revival of composite higgs models  @xcite that attempted to solve these issues . in these models ,",
    "the higgs is a pseudo - goldstone boson of approximate global symmetries that are added on to the standard model ( sm ) . in the little higgs mechanism ,",
    "the electroweak scale is stabilized against quadratically divergent corrections by the manner in which perturbative couplings break the global symmetries . in the simplest models , the higgs mass receives no quadratically divergent quantum corrections until two loop order , although models with a larger symmetry structure can postpone these corrections to higher loop order  @xcite .",
    "the most compact implementation of the little higgs mechanism is known as the littlest higgs model  @xcite . in this model , the sm",
    "is enlarged to incorporate an approximate @xmath10 global symmetry .",
    "this symmetry is broken down to @xmath11 spontaneously , though the mechanism of this breaking is left unspecified .",
    "the higgs is an approximate goldstone boson of this breaking .",
    "while the earliest littlest higgs models have issues with low energy constraints  @xcite , recent studies have shown that this structure is still possible if one adds a discrete @xmath12 symmetry to the model  @xcite .",
    "known as t - parity , this symmetry forbids the couplings which led to stringent electroweak precision and compositeness bounds in the original littlest higgs model .",
    "a consistent and phenomenologically viable littlest higgs model with t - parity requires the introduction of `` mirror fermions ''  @xcite . for each new sm doublet",
    ", there must be another doublet which has the opposite t - parity eigenvalue .",
    "these mirror fermions are required to cut off otherwise large four - fermion operators constrained primarily by lep , and drell - yan processes  @xcite , but they also open up a new flavor structure in the model . from studies of supersymmetry and other models of new physics , it is known that new flavor structure at the tev scale is quite stringently constrained  @xcite .",
    "this is primarily due to the presence , in the sm , of a gim mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the lightness of the sm fermions , coupled with the near diagonal texture of the ckm matrix , strongly suppress flavor and cp violating amplitudes , pushing them well below their naive dimension analysis ( nda ) estimated values . in the absence of a tev scale gim mechanism , new contributions to neutral meson mixing and rare decays are often many orders of magnitude larger than the sm contributions  @xcite .",
    "neutral meson mixing , cp violation , and rare decays have been tested experimentally through a variety of different observables , and are not substantially different than expectations derived from sm calculations .",
    "therefore we expect there to be very little freedom in the new flavor sector . in this paper , we study the flavor constraints on the extended t - odd fermion sector of the littlest higgs model with t - parity . specifically , we consider constraints from neutral meson particle anti - particle mixing , leaving rare decays for future study .    in section  [ model ]",
    ", we outline the conventions used to derive the feynman rules relevant to flavor physics . in section  [ flavorsec ] ,",
    "we discuss how we approach the process of diagonalizing the action to the mass eigenbasis , and identify the new parameters which describe the new sources of flavor mixing and cp violation . in section  [ smmix ] , we outline the calculations for neutral meson mixing in the sm . in section  [ calculation ] , the contributions to neutral meson mixing involving the t - odd fields is presented .",

    "perturbative couplings in the model break the @xmath10 global symmetry explicitly , and quantum corrections involving these interactions generate masses and non - derivative couplings for the goldstone fluctuations , rendering them pseudo - goldstone bosons .",
    "the higgs mass is protected from quadratic divergences at the one - loop level due to the way in which perturbative couplings are introduced .",
    "any single coupling preserves at least one of two overlapping @xmath18 subgroups of the full @xmath10 global symmetry . under these @xmath18 subgroups ,",
    "the higgs is still an exact goldstone boson .",
    "the vev which breaks the @xmath10 softly breaks these @xmath18 symmetries , and thus generates logarithmically divergent contributions to the higgs mass at one loop .",
    "amplitudes involving perturbative couplings only generate a quadratically divergent contribution at two loop order .",

    "the heavy gauge bosons are odd under t - parity , and so tree level four - fermion operators involving sm fermions are also forbidden .    under t - parity ,",
    "the goldstone boson matrix transforms as @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "this transformation law can be derived from the requirement that the kinetic term for @xmath13 be invariant under exchange of the two sets of gauge bosons .",
    "this transformation law for the goldstone bosons ensures that the @xmath43 triplet is odd under t - parity , and that there is thus no trilinear coupling of the triplet to the sm higgs doublet .",

    "we will give now in detail the structure of the fermion sector of the model .",

    ", we assume that the mass of the doublets @xmath65 are much larger than the breaking scale @xmath14 , and the additional singlets @xmath64 have masses of @xmath66 .",
    "they are necessary to cancel two loop quartic divergences to the higgs mass , but are otherwise allowed to be decoupled from the spectrum  @xcite . at @xmath67 ,",
    "the mass is large enough to have only negligible effects on low energy phenomenology , but low enough to keep the higgs mass small .",
    "the @xmath65 doublet is necessary only to cancel a divergence proportional to @xmath68 , which is relatively small , so it is fine for its mass to be rather large ( perhaps @xmath69  tev ) .",
    "increasing its mass also decouples its effects on flavor physics , as the masses are not due to the yukawa coupling @xmath70 , and are simple dirac masses .",
    "the flavor changing couplings of the @xmath64 singlets arise only at order @xmath32 , and thus the effects are suppressed relative to those we calculate . in summary , including these fermions in the flavor analysis is a higher order effect .",
    "we note that if the @xmath65 doublet is taken to be light , then its flavor effects arise through box diagrams where components of the complex triplet @xmath37 run in the loop .    in order to prevent against large contributions to the higgs mass from one loop quadratic divergences ,",
    "the third generation light yukawa interaction must be modified so that it incorporates the collective symmetry breaking structure .",

    "the other two generations of sm up - type quarks acquire their mass through similar terms , though with the @xmath85 quarks missing from the @xmath24 and @xmath27 multiplets since the yukawa couplings are small and these quadratic divergences are suppressed .",
    "the @xmath81 quark only has sizeable `` flavor changing '' interactions with the sm top quark mass eigenstate and the @xmath86  @xcite , and so it does not contribute to any of the processes we study .",
    "before beginning a discussion of the t - odd fermion mass sector , we briefly review the process as it works in the sm  @xcite .",
    "the yukawa sector generates mass matrices for the three up - type quarks given by @xmath87 after ewsb which is diagonalized by two unitary matrices , @xmath88 and @xmath54 : @xmath89 the gauge eigenstates are then expressed in terms of ( the primed ) mass eigenstates by @xmath90 a similar procedure applies to the down - type quark mass matrix .",
    "much of the information contained in the diagonalization of the mass matrices is redundant when one looks at sm amplitudes for cross sections .",

    "these additional mixings are a source of flavor changing processes that are the focus of this paper .",
    "the interaction that gives the t - odd doublets their mass , eq .  (",
    "[ yukdiag ] ) , can be extended to include generational mixing : @xmath95 in analogy with the ckm transformations , the resulting mass matrix @xmath96 is diagonalized by two @xmath97 matrices : @xmath98 @xmath99 acts on the left handed fields while @xmath100 acts on the right handed @xmath50 fields .",
    "we note that these matrices are identical for the up and down - type t - odd fermions , since the resulting dirac mass terms are @xmath43 symmetric .",

    ". in analogy with the ckm matrix then , the rotations relevant to flavor physics are @xmath110 note that the two matrices are related through the sm ckm matrix : @xmath111 this is an important result , as it implies that one can not completely turn off the new mixing effects except with a universally degenerate mass spectrum for the t - odd doublets .",
    "for example , if @xmath112 is set to be the identity , then @xmath113 .",
    "there is a subtlety here involving the t - even partner of the top quark which is responsible for canceling the top quark s quadratically divergent contribution to the higgs mass .",
    "as it is only inserted in the top quark sector , it explicitly breaks flavor symmetries in a way such that the symmetry can not be restored through a spurion analysis . if we were to assume that the up - type yukawa couplings are flavor diagonal , then the top quark divergence is canceled as in the littlest higgs model . from this starting point , where @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 , and @xmath117 .",
    "because there is no symmetry in place which forbids such off - diagonal top - yukawa elements , this perhaps seems a bit unnatural .",
    "we note that the flavor symmetry could easily be restored by completing all three generations of the @xmath45 and @xmath46 doublet quarks to be @xmath29 and @xmath26 triplets .",
    "doing so leads to a somewhat more natural picture of how the top quark divergence is canceled , but at the expense of introducing @xmath118 additional particles ( a t - even and t - odd partner for each of the two remaining up - type quarks ) .",
    "the effects of these new quarks on flavor physics and ewp would be vanishingly small , since , as found in  @xcite , these effects are approximately proportional to @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the mass of either the up or charm quark .",
    "the new @xmath81 flavor contributions would scale in the same way .",
    "since the masses for the first two generations are quite small , this effect is extremely suppressed .",
    "depending on the mass of these new particles , however , the collider phenomenology  @xcite could be quite different .",
    "for the remainder of this analysis , we assume that the flavor symmetry is only explicitly violated by mass terms , and that the fermions come in @xmath121 multiplets , and that therefore , @xmath122 is free to take on any value",
    ". the earlier model can easily be obtained from this one by picking specific mass textures , and decoupling the partners of the lighter up - type quarks .    beyond the sm , there are three new rotation angles , and one new cp violating phase , as we explain here .",
    "there are two unitary matrices which show up in observables , @xmath123 , and @xmath112 .",
    "these have 3 rotations each , and 6 phases each .",
    "there are 6 quark fields which transform under @xmath45 , and 6 under @xmath46 .",
    "each set of 6 quark fields can absorb 5 phases ( an overall phase in each sector is unobservable ) .",
    "what remains are 6 total rotations , and 2 cp violating phases .",
    "one combination of @xmath123 and @xmath112 gives the sm ckm matrix , which has 3 rotations and 1 phase .",
