    "brown dwarfs ( bds ; basri 2000 ) are the star - like objects , which are not massive enough to sustain stable hydrogen burning , but are sufficiently massive to fuse deuterium ( chabrier et al . 2000 ; spiegel et al . 2011 ) . as a result , their luminosity and temperature drop throughout their lifetimes ( e.g. burrows et al . 1997 ; baraffe et al .",
    "2003 ) . to date , over 800 bds have been directly and indirectly discovered through a variety of methods ( e.g. , rebolo et al . 1995 ; oppenheimer et al . 1995 ; ruiz et al . 1997 ; tinney et al . 1997 ; kirkpatrick et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 , 2011 ; marcy & bulter 2000 ; mayor & udry 2000 ; sahlmann et al .",
    "most of the known bds are free - floating objects detected in the imaging surveys .",
    "these surveys seem to imply a continuous distribution of masses through the hydrogen burning limit , with the abundance of bd rivaling that of stars .    the radial velocity ( rv ) technique has been rapidly developed in last three decades , and has led to the first discoveries of extrasolar planets around solar - like stars ( latham et al .",
    "1989 ; mayor & queloz 1995 ; marcy & butler 1996 ) .",
    "since the reflex rv semi - amplitudes induced by bd companions could be many hundreds of meters per second , which are considerably larger than the signals induced by planetary companions , rv surveys should easily discover bd companions .",
    "however , only 60 bd companions to solar - like stars in relatively short ( @xmath12 days ) orbits have been identified in all the previous rv surveys ( e.g. marcy & butler 2000 ; mayor & udry 2000 ; vogt et al . 2002 ; sahlmann et al .",
    "2011 ; daz et al .",
    "the distribution of masses for spectroscopic companions to solar - like stars shows a clear deficit in the bd mass range ( the `` brown dwarf desert '' ; marcy & butler 2000 ) , quite in contrast to the surveys of free - floating bds .",
    "moreover , the statistical investigations of stellar companion to solar - like stars have shown a paucity of companions with mass ratios ( @xmath13 ) @xmath14 0.2 , suggesting that the short period bd desert extends in mass toward the low - mass star regime ( pont et al .",
    "2005 ; burgasser et al . 2007 ; bouchy et al . 2011 ; wisniewski et al . 2012 ) .    the multi - object apo radial velocity exoplanet large - area survey ( marvels ) , part of the sloan digital sky survey iii ( sdss - iii ; eisenstein et al .",
    "2011 ) program , monitors several thousands of stars in the magnitude range @xmath15=812 by visiting each star @xmath1624 times over an 18-month interval with moderate rv precision ( ge et al .",
    "2008 ; ge et al . 2009 ; ge & eisenstein 2009 ) . currently , more than ten very low mass stellar and substellar companion candidates have been identified . in order to confirm the discoveries and characterize them further , the marvels survey team made extensive follow - up observations , including high precision rv monitoring , high - resolution spectroscopy , time - series photometry and high - contrast imaging .",
    "high precision rv follow - up observations are useful to refine the orbital solutions and to detect additional lower mass companions in the candidate systems .",
    "we also used the multi - epoch high - resolution spectroscopy to rule out potential false alarms due to spectral contamination at the moderate resolving power of marvels spectrograph .",
    "marvels-1b was announced as the first detection of bd candidates from marvels ( lee et al .",
    "further analysis of precise radial velocities made with the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) high resolution spectrograph initially suggested an interior giant planet in a 3:1 period commensuribility with marvels-1b .",
    "however , the apparent rv residuals to a one - companion fit were later proved to be due to spectral contamination by a stellar companion .",
    "this was determined by the identification of strong line bisector variations ( wright et al .",
    "marvels-1 is actually a face - on double - lined spectroscopic binary , instead of a single star with a bd companion . in another marvels candidate bd system ( tyc 3010 - 1494 - 1 ) , a highly eccentric , double - lined spectroscopic binary star system masqueraded as the rv signal of a single star orbited by a very low mass companion ( mack et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "excluding these two false positive detections , three out of four published marvels discoveries have a possible tertiary companion detected at wide separations in their systems .",
    "marvels-2b is likely to be a low - mass stellar companion with a short period orbit around the f star tyc 2930 - 00872 - 1 and a stellar tertiary is identified by analyzing the long - term trend in the rv curve ( fleming et al .",
    "for marvels-3b , a faint candidate tertiary companion is detected in the keck adaptive optics image , separated by @xmath161  from its host star ( tyc 4110 - 01037 - 1 ; wisniewski et al .",
    "( 2013 ) detected a faint point source at a separation of @xmath160.6  from the host star of marvels-4b ( tyc 2087 - 00255 - 1 ) through high - contrast imaging .",
    "future proper motion observations are necessary to resolve whether the offset objects are physically associated with the host stars .",
    "nevertheless , these results have encouraged the marvels team to keep assessing the multiplicity for every future discovery in the survey .",
    "currently , there are about 60 bd companions to solar - like stars reported in the literature .",
    "the distribution of masses of the companions exhibits a local minimum ( the most `` arid '' part of the desert ) in the mass range of @xmath163050 @xmath17 ( sahlmann et al .",
    "2011 ; ma & ge 2013 ) .",
    "the tentative bimodal distribution of mass may indicate that there are two formation mechanisms of bd and low - mass stellar companions : the low - mass bds form by core accretion in protoplanetary disks ; while more massive companions form by gravitational collapse ( grether & lineweaver 2006 ; sahlmann et al .",
    "2011 ; ma & ge 2013 ) .",
    "moreover , the properties of host stars might also have an important impact on the formation of bd companions .",
    "bouchy et al .",
    "( 2011 ) reported that super - jupiters , bds , and low - mass m dwarf companions ( 10100 @xmath17 ) to g - type ( @xmath18k ) stars were apparently less common than similar companions to hotter stars .",
    "compared to the metallicity of the planet hosts ( santos et al .",
    "2001 ; valenti & fischer 2005 ; johnson et al . 2010 ) , the hosts of bd companions are not that metal rich in general ( ma & ge 2013 ) .",
    "apparently the statistics of physical parameters are important for us to understand the formation and evolution of low - mass companions .",
    "therefore , the marvels team has taken pains to follow up marvels candidates in order to collect a uniformly characterized sample for a meta - analysis .",
    "in this paper , we report a candidate bd or a low - mass stellar companion ( marvels-5b ) to hip 67526 with a period of @xmath1690 days from marvels . in section 2.1 ,",
    "we describe the rv measurements and solve for the spectroscopic orbital elements using markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) analysis .",
    "we analyze the photometric data from superwasp and the astrometric data from hipparcos in sections 2.2 & 2.3 , respectively . in section 3.1 ,",
    "we determine precise stellar parameters for the primary star . using the stellar mass derived in section 3.2",
    ", we then estimate the mass of the companion in section 3.3 .",
    "the evolutionary state of the host star is studied in section 3.4 .",
    "the high - contrast imaging is presented in section 3.5 .",
    "finally , we provide a discussion and a summary in section 4 .",
    "hip 67526 was selected as an rv survey target according to the marvels preselection criterion ( lee et al .",
    "it has been monitored at 21 epochs using the marvels instrument mounted on sdss 2.5-m telescope at apache point observatory ( gunn et al .",
    "2006 ) during the first two - year cycle of the sdss - iii marvels planet search program ( ge et al .",
    "the marvels instrument is a fiber - fed dispersed fixed - delay interferometer instrument capable of observing 60 objects simultaneously , designed for a large - scale rv survey ( ge 2002 ; ge et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the dispersed fixed - delay interferometer instrument principle is described in several prior papers ( ge 2002 ; ge et al .",
    "2002 ; erskine 2003 ; ge et al .",
    "2006 ; van eyken et al . 2010 ; wang et al .",
    "the marvels interferometer delay calibration is described by wang et al .",
    "( 2012a , b ) .",
    "the interferometer produces two fringing spectra per object , covering a wavelength range of 50005700   , with resolving power of @xmath1912,000 .",
    "two iodine absorption spectra of light from a tungsten lamp taken before and after each science exposure are used to calibrate any instrument drift .",
    "data processing and the error estimation algorithm have been described in detail by lee et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and fleming et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , respectively .",
    "hip 67526 was identified as a star bearing an unseen companion by performing lomb - scargle ( l - s ) periodogram analysis ( e.g. lomb 1976 ; scargle 1982 ; cumming 2004 ; baluev 2008 ) on the 21 marvels rv points .",
    "there are two significant peaks on the l - s periodogram with periods at @xmath1688 days and @xmath1646 days ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the false alarm probability ( hereafter fap ) of the 88 day peak is 0.00367% , and the fap of the 46 day peak is 0.0201% .",
    "we fit a keplerian orbit to the observed rv curve , forcing the period to be close to @xmath1688 days and @xmath1646 days .",
    "the preliminary fitting results are illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "the solution at an orbital period of 90.2 days provides a better fit to the marvels rv curve than the solution at an orbital period of 45.6 days .",
    "the shorter orbital period peak in the periodogram is probably an alias . the minimum mass ( if @xmath201 ) of the unseen companion from the longer period solution is @xmath1665 @xmath17 ( see section 3.3 for details ) .",
    "the estimated minimum mass is below the hydrogen burning limit and places marvels-5b within the sparsely - populated region of the mass function of companions to solar - like stars .",
    "we collected ten additional rv measurements with the sarg spectrograph ( gratton et al .",
    "2001 ) at the 3.58 m telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) telescope in late 2010 and 2011 .",
    "the spectrograph covers a wavelength range of 46207920   with @xmath1957,000 .",
    "the simultaneous iodine cell technique ( butler et al . 1996 ) was employed to calibrate the rv measurements .",
    "the raw spectra were reduced by using the standard iraf echelle reduction packages .",
    "the final extracted differential rvs from marvels and tng / sarg are presented in table 1 .",
    "the rv curve was sampled in total at 31 epochs using these two instruments over 2.5 years .",
    "we have performed a bayesian analysis of the observed radial velocities using a model consisting of the primary star and one low - mass companion on an eccentric keplerian orbit based on the combined differential rv observations of marvels and tng / sarg .",
    "we calculated a posterior sample using the mcmc technique as described in ford ( 2006 ) .",
    "each state in the markov chain is described by the parameter set @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is orbital period , @xmath23 is the velocity semi - amplitude , @xmath24 is the orbital eccentricity , @xmath25 is the argument of periastron , @xmath26 is the mean anomaly at the chosen epoch ( @xmath27 ) . the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 are constant systemic velocity terms for the marvels and tng / sarg instruments respectively , used to account for the offsets between the observed differential rv data and the zero point of the keplerian rv model .",
    "the `` jitter '' parameter , @xmath30 , describes any excess noise ( wright 2005 ) , including both astrophysical sources of noise ( e.g. stellar oscillation , stellar spots ) and any instrumental noise not accounted for in the quoted measurement uncertainties .",
    "we use standard priors for each parameter ( see ford & gregory 2007 ) . the prior is uniform in the log of the orbital period @xmath22 , while for @xmath23 and @xmath30 we used a modified jefferys prior ( gregory 2005 ) .",
    "priors for the remaining parameters are uniform : @xmath24 ( between zero and unity ) , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( between zero and @xmath31 ) , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "following ford ( 2006 ) , we adopt a likelihood ( i.e. , conditional probability of making the specified measurements given a particular set of model parameters ) of @xmath32}{\\sqrt{{\\sigma_j}^2+{\\sigma_k}^2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is observed velocity at time @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the model velocity at time @xmath34 given the model parameters @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the measurement uncertainty for the observation at time @xmath34 .",
    "to test the robustness of the mcmc analysis , we calculate five markov chains starting from different initial states , each for @xmath38 states . to prevent the choice of initial states from influencing our results , we consider only the second half of each chain .",
    "we calculate the gelman - rubin test statistic ( that compares the variance of a parameter within each chain to the variance between chains ; gelman & rubin 1992 ) for each model parameter .",
    "we find no indications that the markov chains have yet to converge and conclude that the markov chains provide an adequate posterior sample for inferring the orbital parameters and uncertainties .",
    "we combine the markov chains described above to estimate the joint posterior probability distribution for the orbital model of hip 67526 . for orbital eccentricity",
    ", we also used the @xmath39 method described in wang ( 2011 ) , which leads to a similar result to that from the mcmc analysis .",
    "the median values are taken for each model parameter based on the marginal posterior probability distributions .",
    "the uncertainties are calculated as the standard deviation about the mean value from the combined posterior sample .",
    "since the shape of the marginal posterior distribution is roughly similar to a multivariate normal distribution , the median value plus or minus the reported uncertainty roughly corresponds to a 68.3% confidence interval .",
    "finally , we convert the model parameters to traditional standard parameters of a spectroscopic orbit and report the results in table 2 .",
    "the phase - folded rv curve is presented in figure 3 .",
    "we searched the superwasp public archived database ( butters 2010 ) and found 1378 photometric data measurements of hip 67526 observed in 2004 and 5680 data points in 2007 .",
    "the mean absolute deviation of the light curve is 9.7 mmag .",
    "we first searched for a transit - like dip in brightness at short periods between 0.210 days .",
    "we find no significant detection of a transit event .",
    "next , we searched for transits specifically in the range of 8595 days , which includes the best - fit period from the spectroscopic rv curve .",
    "the phase - folded data are sparsely covered at these long periods , and we find no significant transit signal . in summary , we do not find a transit in superwasp photometric data with a long or a short period .",
    "we also attempted to search for a sinusoidal signal in the light curve but found no significant signal .",
    "hip 67526 exists in the hipparcos catalog with a parallax distance of 100@xmath810 pc from the sun .",
    "it is possible that the orbital motion of the star due to the gravitational influence of its companion can be resolved by hipparcos astrometry .",
    "this would allow the the inclination @xmath40 and the ascending node @xmath41 of the keplerian orbit , and thus the true mass of marvels-5b , to be well constrained ( sahlmann et al .",
    "we retrieved the dataset of hip 67526 from the intermediate astrometric data ( iad ) of the new hipparcos reduction ( van leeuwen 2007 ) , including the satellite orbit number , the epoch @xmath42 , the parallax factor @xmath43 , the scan angle orientation @xmath44 , the abscissa residual @xmath45 and the abscissa error @xmath46 for every satellite scan .",
    "there are 123 available hipparcos scans on hip 67526 in the iad and the average abscissa error is @xmath4710 mas .",
    "thus , the dataset allows a 1@xmath48 detection of an orbit with an angular size of @xmath49 mas .",
    "we then estimate the minimum angular semimajor axis ( in mas ) of the primary s orbit , which can be written as @xmath50 where @xmath23 ( in m s@xmath3 ) , @xmath22 ( in yr ) and @xmath24 the spectroscopic orbital elements , @xmath51 ( in mas ) the parallax , @xmath40 the unknown inclination ( pourbaix 2001 ) .",
    "this equation yields a minimum angular semimajor axis @xmath16 0.2 mas for hip 67526 .",
    "therefore , for nearly edge - on orbits , the angular size of the primary s orbit is well below the 1@xmath48 detection threshold , and thus the motion of hip 67526 about the system s center - of - mass can not be detected for such geometries .",
    "assuming that the hipparcos data of hip 67526 are consistent with no astrometric signal from the orbit about the center - of - mass of the system , and that orbits of @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 mas would have been detected at @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , we can place an upper limits on the companion mass of @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) , and @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) , and @xmath62 ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "as argued in section 3.3 , such massive companions are anyway a posteriori unlikely for flat or falling priors on the companion mass distribution . for priors that increase with increasing mass ,",
    "companions of mass @xmath63 are not a posteriori implausible , but would be ruled out based on the lack of evidence of a second set of spectral lines in the high - resolution spectra , if the companion was luminous ( i.e. , not a remnant )",
    "in order to characterize the host star hip 67526 , two moderate - resolution spectra ( r@xmath1631,500 ) were taken with the arc echelle spectrograph ( arces ; wang et al . 2003 ) mounted on the apache point observatory 3.5 m telescope on ut 2010 june 10 .",
    "the spectra cover the full optical range from 3600   to 1.0 @xmath64 m .",
    "the spectra were obtained using the default @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 slit and an exposure time of 1200 s. the raw data were processed using standard iraf techniques .",
    "the extracted 1d spectra were converted to vacuum wavelengths and to the heliocentric frame .",
    "the data were normalized by fitting a series of polynomials to the continuum .",
    "we utilized two individual pipelines to derive basic stellar parameters such as @xmath68 , @xmath5 and [ fe / h ] for the host star .",
    "both pipelines are based on the requirements of excitation and ionization equilibria of fe  i and fe  ii . however , different versions of atlas9 plane - parallel model atmospheres ( kurucz 1993 and castelli & kurucz 2004 ) and different iteration algorithms are implemented .",
    "we refer the readers to wisniewski et al .",
    "( 2012 ) for more details on the pipelines .",
    "the derived stellar parameters from these two pipelines are usually consistent to within 1@xmath48 of the associated errors .",
    "thus , we simply adopted the weighted average values as the final determined stellar parameters .",
    "we combined the internal errors from the two pipelines as @xmath69 for each parameter , and added in quadrature a systematic error of 18 k , 0.08 , 0.03 and 0.02 km s@xmath3 for @xmath68 , @xmath5 , [ fe / h ] and @xmath70 , respectively ( wisniewski et al .",
    "the final results are summarized in table 3 .",
    "we collected the optical and nir absolute photometry of hip 67526 from the hipparcos , 2mass and wise catalogs ( table 3 ) to construct a spectral energy distribution ( sed ; see figure 4 ) and fit it with a nextgen model atmosphere ( hauschildt et al .",
    "the resultant stellar parameters , @xmath71 k , @xmath5 [ cgs ] @xmath72 and [ fe / h ] = @xmath73 , are in good agreement with the parameters derived from spectroscopy within the errorbars .",
    "in addition , the sed fitting indicates that hip 67526 suffers only slight extinction ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "we determine the stellar mass and radius using two methods .",
    "first , we use the empirical relationship of torres et al .",
    "( 2010 ) with our values for @xmath68 , @xmath5 and [ fe / h ] .",

    "( 2010 ) and the scatter in the relation as reported in their study .",
    "the correlations between the stellar parameters @xmath68 , @xmath5 and [ fe / h ] are not measured and are therefore not considered .",
    "we find a mass @xmath75 and a radius @xmath76 .",
    "the existence of a trigonometric parallax provides additional information to constrain the mass and radius of the primary star .",
    "we incorporate this data by running a mcmc analysis that fully explores parameter space .",
    "one million iterations in the mcmc chain were run , stepping through @xmath77 , @xmath5 , [ fe / h ] , parallax ( @xmath51 ) and @xmath78 .",
    "we use random starting values to initiate the chain . for each iteration",
    ", we calculate a mass and radius following torres et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and the iteration s values of @xmath79 , @xmath5 and [ fe / h ] .",
    "a stellar luminosity is calculated via the stefan - boltzmann law , then a bolometric correction to the 2mass @xmath80 band is applied by interpolating the table of corrections as a function of @xmath77 for [ m / h ] = 0.0 and @xmath81 from masana et al .",
    "the absolute @xmath80 magnitude is calculated from the luminosity and bolometric correction , after which the apparent magnitude is calculated from the absolute magnitude and the iteration s values of @xmath51 and @xmath78 .",

    "( 2011 ) to compute the 3@xmath48 detectability ( @xmath112 ) curves on each of the images whose @xmath110@xmath113  region around hip 67526 has been depicted in figure 7 : at a given angular distance @xmath114 from hip 67526 we identify all possible sets of small boxes of a size larger but comparable to the fwhm of the psf ( i.e. @xmath115 pixel boxes ) .",
    "only regions of the image showing structures easily recognizable as spikes due to diffraction of the telescope spider and/or artifacts on the read - out of the detector are dismissed .",

    "this procedure on each of the li % thresholding values ( in steps of 1% ) produces a detectability curve , while the envelope of all the family of curves for a given night yields the best possible detectability curve to be extracted from the whole data set .",
    "these `` best li curves '' for each of the three nights are depicted in figure 8 , where we can see the data collected are of similar quality with the data on may 8th providing slightly better contrast values .",
    "no stellar tertiary to hip 67526 is detected above the `` best li curves '' .      to further assess the multiplicity of hip 67526 , we acquired high angular resolution images of the star on 24 june , 2012 ut using nirc2 ( instrument pi : keith matthew ) with the keck ii adaptive optics ( ao ) system ( wizinowich et al . 2000 ) . ao observations probe the immediate vicinity of host stars , and generate deep contrast compared to lucky imaging ( e.g. , fleming et al .",

    "figures 9 and 10 show the final reduced ao image and corresponding contrast curve .",
    "no candidate companions were noticed in individual raw frames or the final reduced image .",

    "( 2000 ) to derive the upper mass limit of the undetected companions ; this analysis results in an upper mass limit 0.2@xmath9 for separations larger than 40 au and 0.1@xmath9 for separations larger than 100 au .",
    "the frequency of bd companions to solar - like stars at close and intermediate separations is less than 1% ( marcy & butler 2000 ) , which is much less than the frequency of planetary companions ( @xmath12110% , e.g. howard et al . 2010 ; mayor et al . 2011 ) and the frequency of spectroscopic stellar binaries detected in rv surveys ( @xmath1614% e.g. halbwachs et al . 2003 ) . the frequency of bd companions was recently updated to be @xmath140.6% by sahlmann et al . (",
    "2011 ) on the basis of the coralie planet - search sample .",
    "this result is more accurate , since the authors ruled out companions having true masses in the stellar regime using the hipparcos astrometric measurements to determine the orbital inclinations .",
    "constraining the mass distribution of companions can provide an important observational clue to distinguish the formation and evolution mechanism of planetary , bd and stellar companions .",
    "the current mass distribution suggests that low - mass bd companions less than @xmath1630 @xmath17 are likely to form in protoplanetary disks , while companions more massive than @xmath1645 @xmath17 forms via fragmentation ( grether & lineweaver 2006 ; sahlmann et al .",

    "spectroscopic binaries generally show moderately eccentric orbits ( e.g. , duquennoy & mayor 1991 ; raghavan et al .",
    "ribas & miralda - escud ( 2007 ) reported a tentative trend that low - mass planets ( @xmath122 4 @xmath17 ) generally have lower eccentricity than high - mass planets ( @xmath123 4 @xmath17 ) , having a similar eccentricity distribution as binary stars ( figure 3 of ribas & miralda - escud 2007 ) .",
    "daz et al .",
    "( 2012 ) reported that most of the bd companions in their sample exhibit a considerable orbital eccentricity , supporting the eccentricity - mass trend .",
    "marvels-5b has a high eccentricity ( @xmath160.44 ) , which is around the peak of the eccentricity distribution of the observed bd and low - mass stellar companions ( sahlmann et al .",
    "2011 ; daz et al .",
    "marvels-5b probably is a member of the main population of these massive companions to solar - like stars in view of its eccentricity .",
    "our previous marvels discoveries ( marvels-2,3,4,6b ) all have an eccentricity lower than @xmath160.2 ( de lee et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "a stellar tertiary is likely to affect the formation and evolution of the substellar companion to the primary .",
    "observationally , zucker & mazeh ( 2002 ) point out that planets found in binaries may have a negative period - mass correlation rather than the positive correlation between the masses and periods of the planets orbiting single stars . by studying a larger sample ( 19 planets in a double or multiple star system ) , eggenberger et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2007 ) showed that short - period ( @xmath124 40 days ) planets found in multiple star systems may follow a different period - eccentricity distribution than the short - period planets around isolated stars .",
    "these observations seem to indicate that the presence of a stellar companion alters the migration and mass growth rates of planets ( kley 2001 ) .",
    "similar influences have been also observed on close spectroscopic binaries in triple systems .",
    "shorter period binaries are more likely to be in multiple - star systems , i.e. @xmath1680% for @xmath124 7 days versus @xmath1640% for @xmath125 7 days ( tokovinin et al .",
    "this significant difference suggests that the periods of close binary systems with triples were efficiently decreased by angular momentum exchange with companions .    with masses between planetary companions and stellar components in spectroscopic binaries ,",
    "the formation and migration of bd and low - mass stellar companions can certainly be affected by the presence of a tertiary as well . however",
    ", this problem has not been studied in a statistical way , since the current bd and low - mass stellar companion sample is fairly small and no systematic survey of stellar tertiaries for these companions has been conducted . using high - contrast imaging , the marvels survey goes to great lengths to investigate the statistics of its own discoveries of low - mass companions in the presence / absence of a stellar tertiary .",
    "as mentioned in section 1 , most of the previous marvels discoveries have a stellar tertiary ( or a candidate stellar tertiary ) detected by either the high - contrast imaging or the analysis of long - term rv trend . among the confirmed discoveries , marvels-3b ( wisniewski et al .",
    "2012 ) has a similar orbital period ( @xmath126 days ) and minimum mass ratio ( @xmath127 ) as marvels-5b ( this work ) , but the former has a less eccentric orbit ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "wisniewski et al .",
    "( 2012 ) found a faint candidate tertiary companion on the keck adaptive optics image , separated by @xmath161  from the primary , thus speculating that marvels-3b might initially have formed in a tertiary system with much different orbital parameters and reach its current short - period orbit during the cluster dispersal phase .",
    "for marvels-5b , the keck adaptive optics imaging rules out any star with mass greater than 0.1@xmath9 at a separation larger than 1  from the primary .",
    "this may imply that other formation mechanisms of low - mass ratio binaries are needed .    in summary",
    ", we report a candidate bd or low - mass stellar companion to the solar - like star hip 67526 .",
