    "it has long been suggested that the dust grains play a major role in the formation of molecular hydrogen in the interstellar medium ( ism ) ( gould & salpeter , 1963 ) .",
    "considerable studies were made since then to understand the real physical processes which are taking place both theoretically ( e.g. , hollenbach , werner & salpeter , 1971 ; takahashi , matsuda & nagaoka , 1999 ; biham et al .",
    "2001 ) as well as experimentally ( e.g. , pirronello et al .",
    "1997a , b , 1999 ) .",
    "more recently , biham et al . ( 2001 ) , and green et al . (",
    "2001 ) have computed @xmath6 production rate by physisorption .",
    "it was found that a significant production is possible in cooler ( @xmath7k ) clouds .",
    "cazaux & tielens ( 2002 , 2004 ) use both physisorption and chemisorption , to demonstrate that @xmath6 production is possible at high temperatures ( @xmath8k ) also .",
    "the goal is to study the rate at which the @xmath9 atoms combine together on the surface of the grains to form @xmath6 and then they are desorbed into the gas phase to react with other atoms .",
    "when compared with the average mass fractions of various molecular species obtained through gas phase reactions ( see , chakrabarti & chakrabarti , 2000ab ; das et al .",
    "2006 ) , it was found that the observed abundances of more complex species , such as methanol , are much higher .",
    "it is possible that methanol as well as its precursors also have to be formed on grain surfaces through successive hydrogenation .",
    "our finding for molecular hydrogen has thus important bearings on the formation of more complex molecules on grains .",
    "these molecules would , in turn , desorb into the gas phase and would be expected to produce more complex species such as amino acids in due course .",
    "one of the most challenging problems is to determine the average rate at which the recombination of atomic hydrogen takes place on a grain surface . in theoretical investigations which are prevalent in the subject ( see , acharyya and chakrabarti , 2005 ; hereafter paper i ; acharyya , chakrabarti and chakrabarti , 2005 ; hereafter acc05 ) , the diffusion rate @xmath3 ( inverse of the diffusion time @xmath10 ) is divided by @xmath0 , the number of sites on the grain surface ( e.g. , biham et al .",
    "2001 ) to get the recombination rate .",
    "the argument for reducing the rate by a factor of @xmath0 is this : on an average , there are @xmath11 number of sites in each direction of the grain . since the hopping is random , it would take square of this , i.e. , @xmath0 number of hopping to reach a distance located at @xmath11 sites away , where , on an average , another @xmath9 is available .",
    "thus , the effective recombination rate was chosen to be @xmath12 .",
    "it is an empirical factor and needs more careful treatment . in our present paper , we replace @xmath0 by an unknown quantity @xmath13 , where @xmath14 may be time dependent ( if the grain and cloud parameters change ) and it could also deviate from unity .",
    "let @xmath15 when a steady state is reached .",
    "higher the accretion rate , lesser should be the value of @xmath16 as the effective surface area @xmath17 @xmath18 gets smaller and smaller .",
    "the opposite is true for smaller accretion rates .",
    "in fact , in the limit , if the accretion rate is so low , that a lone @xmath9 sweeps around the grain several times to find another @xmath9 , one would get @xmath19 since the effective site number is higher than @xmath0 . using our simulation ,",
    "we determine how the effective site number deviates from @xmath0 , one way or the other when the accretion rate is varied .",
    "our result is likely to have important consequences for the formation of other hydrogenated species , such as water , methanol on grain surfaces .",
    "this will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "some preliminary results with steady state @xmath16 have been presented in das et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and chakrabarti et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . in the current paper",
    ", we discuss the time and temperature dependence of @xmath20 and studied the cases for more varied astrophysically important accretion rates .    in the next section",
    ", we present the modified typical equations which govern the molecular hydrogen production rate on a grain surface . incorporating the _ physical aspects",
    "_ of these equations , we perform a numerical simulation to determine the numbers on the grains . in  2 , we present the procedure for the simulation and in  3 we present the results for two types of commonly used grains , namely , olivine and amorphous carbon .",
    "we show how @xmath14 depends on time and how it settles into a number ( generally , @xmath21 ) when steady state is reached .",
    "finally , in  4 , we present our concluding remarks .",
    "the relevant equations which are generally solved on grain surfaces have been presented in paper i ( eqs .",
    "2a - d ) and we do not repeat them here .",
    "however , for monte - carlo simulation we need to modify these equations . since in our simulation we expect to get the rate of diffusion ( @xmath22 ) of h exactly , we can _ assume _ that the recombination time at any instant @xmath23 could be written in the form : @xmath24 where , @xmath17 is an ` effective surface area ' which we may be written as @xmath25 .",
    "here , @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is the accretion rate of @xmath9 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 being the area of a grain , @xmath30 is the average velocity and @xmath31 is the number density of @xmath9 in the gas phase .",
    "our goal would be to compute the steady state value @xmath32 for various grains ( type and size ) at various accretion rates and grain temperatures and to check if @xmath33 .",
    "thus , instead of eqs .",
    "2a of paper i , the actual governing equation for atomic hydrogen should be , @xmath34 along with equation governing the rate of production of @xmath6 given by , @xmath35 where , @xmath3 is the hopping rate given by @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the desorption co - efficient of hydrogen atom given by , @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the desorption co - efficient of hydrogen molecule given by , @xmath40 . here , @xmath41 is the activation barrier energy for diffusion of h atom , @xmath42 is the activation barrier energy for desorption of @xmath9 atom and @xmath43 is the activation barrier energy for desorption of @xmath6 molecule , @xmath44 is the vibrational frequency given by , @xmath45 , @xmath46 be the number of @xmath9 atoms , and @xmath47 be the number of @xmath6 on a grain at time @xmath23 , @xmath48 is the surface density of sites on a grain , @xmath49 is the mass of the @xmath9 atom and @xmath50 is the binding energy .",
    "the parameter @xmath51 represents the fraction of @xmath6 molecules that remains on the surface upon formation while ( 1-@xmath51 ) fraction is desorbed due to the energy released in the recombination process .",
    "the @xmath6 production rate @xmath52 in the gas due to grain is then given by , @xmath53 the values of the activation barrier energies @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are taken from katz et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and are given by , @xmath54 mev , @xmath55 mev and @xmath56 mev for olivine and @xmath57 mev , @xmath58 mev and @xmath59 mev for amorphous carbon grains .",
    "for olivine , @xmath60 and for amorphous carbon @xmath61 was used .    for the sake of simplicity , we assume each grain to be square in shape having @xmath62 number of sites ( square lattice ) .",
    "we use periodic boundary condition so that the lattice behaves like a closed surface .",
    "we anticipate that the result would be insensitive to the actual nature of the lattice when simulation is done for a long time .",
    "we use mono - layer on the grain surface .",
    "we choose the minimum time step to be @xmath63 , the hopping time and advance the global time by this step .",
    "if @xmath64 is the effective accretion rate ( as defined above ) , after every time step , i.e. , after every @xmath65 seconds , @xmath66 number of hydrogen atoms are dropped on the grain . if @xmath64 is too low so that @xmath67 , then , clearly , one h is dropped after every @xmath68 steps .",
    "the exact site at which one atom is dropped is obtained by a pair of random numbers ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) obtained by a random number generator .",
    "this pair would place the incoming hydrogen at ( @xmath71)th grid , where , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the nearest integers obtained using the int function : @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "each atom starts hopping with equal probability in all four directions .",
    "this was decided by another random number .",
    "when , during the hopping process , one atom enters a site which is already occupied by another atom , we assume that a molecule has been formed and increase the number of @xmath6 by unity .",
    "however , when the atom enters a site occupied by an @xmath6 , another random number is generated to decide which one of the other neatest sites it is going to occupy",
    ".    thermal evaporation of @xmath9 and @xmath6 from a grain surface are handled in the following way .",
    "since @xmath37 is the desorption rate for @xmath9 , one atom is supposed to be released to the gas phase after every @xmath76 seconds .",
    "we generate a random number @xmath77 for every @xmath9 present on the grain and release ( at each time step , i.e. , @xmath65 seconds ) only those for which @xmath78 .",
    "similar procedure is followed for the evaporation of @xmath6 for which the criterion for evaporation was @xmath79 .    due to spontaneous desorption , a factor of ( 1-@xmath51 ) of @xmath47",
    "is lost to the gas phase . here too , a random number @xmath80 is generated for each newly formed ( within that time step ) @xmath6 present on the grain .",
    "those which satisfy @xmath81 are removed to the gas phase .",
    "we continue our simulation for more than @xmath82s . after an initial transient period , @xmath46 and @xmath47 reaches a quasi - steady state with some fluctuations . in a steady state",
    ", @xmath16 can be calculated using eq .",
    "2a , i.e. , @xmath83 in this context , one important parameter @xmath84 may be defined as the ` catalytic capacity ' of a grain ( chakrabarti et al . 2006 ) which measures the efficiency of the _ formation _ of @xmath6 on that grain surface for a given pair of @xmath9 residing on it .",
    "let @xmath85 be the number of @xmath6 _ formed _ in @xmath86 time .",
    "since two hydrogen atoms are required to create one @xmath6 , the average rate of creation of one @xmath6 per pair of @xmath9 atom would be given by , @xmath87 we identify the inverse of this rate with the average formation rate given by , @xmath88 thus , @xmath89 this yields @xmath90 as a function of time as , @xmath91 here too we can define @xmath92 . our goal would be to see if @xmath93 thus obtained actually varies with grain parameters , accretion rate and temperatures . intuitively , it should .",
    "this is because , when the accretion rate is very low , finding a second @xmath9 on the grain would be difficult and it can take several sweeps of the grain surface . thus @xmath94 would be a possibility . on the other hand ,",
    "when the rate is very high , many sites would be occupied and another @xmath9 would be met along any direction and @xmath93 could come down to @xmath95 or even less . indeed , this is what we see as well .",
    "we have carried out the simulation with and without spontaneous desorption taken into account . in presence of the spontaneous desorption",
    ", we remove @xmath6 by generating a random number as soon as one @xmath6 is formed and checking if it is less or more compared to @xmath51 . if less , @xmath6 remains on the grain , else it is taken out to the gas phase .",

    "in this paper , we studied the behaviour of the average recombination time of atomic hydrogens on grain surfaces as a function of time , temperature , accretion rate and grain parameters . in the literature",

    "however , we find that this simplistic assumption is not valid especially when the accretion rate of @xmath9 on the grain is very low or very high . for very low rates , an atomic hydrogen may have to sweep a grain several times before meeting another atom to form a molecule . for very high rates , the grain surfaces could be partially filled with @xmath9 and @xmath6 and search for another @xmath9 need not take @xmath0 number of hops .",
    "we found that on an average , @xmath16 , the index which determines the average recombination time , could be grater than 1 for very low rates .",
    "we also find that @xmath16 depends very strongly on the nature of the grains as well as the temperature and grain site numbers .",

    "the results we obtained are likely to be astrophysically important because of several factors .",
    "the physical reason of the dependence of the average recombination time is so generic that one needs to revise all the abundances made on the grain surfaces .",

    "<S> a knowledge of the recombination time on the grain surfaces has been a major obstacle in deciding the production rate of molecular hydrogen and other molecules in the interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> we present a numerical study to compute this time for molecular hydrogen for various cloud and grain parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we also find the time dependence , particularly when a grain is freshly injected into the system . apart from the fact that the recombination times seem to be functions of the grain parameters such as the activation barrier energy , temperature etc </S>",
    "<S> , our result also shows the dependence on the number of sites in the grain @xmath0 and the effective accretion rate per site @xmath1 of atomic hydrogen . </S>",
    "<S> simply put , the average time that a pair of atomic hydrogens will take to produce one molecular hydrogen depends on how heavily the grain is already populated by atomic and molecular hydrogens and how fast the hopping and desorption times are . </S>",
    "<S> we show that if we write the average recombination time as @xmath2 , where , @xmath3 is the hopping rate , then @xmath4 could be much greater than @xmath5 for all astrophysically relevant accretion rates . </S>",
    "<S> thus the average formation rate of @xmath6 is also dependent on the grain parameters , temperature and the accretion rate . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that our result will affect the overall rate of the formation of complex molecules such as methanol which require successive hydrogenation on the grain surfaces in the interstellar medium .    molecular cloud </S>",
