    "entanglement is a birth - mark of quantum mechanics . a pure state of a closed quantum system evolves as a pure state , and all the measures of entanglement remain constant during the evolution .",
    "however , if the system is composed of interacting subsystems , the reduced density matrix of one of them   a measure of coherence lost in this subsystem   does not evolve in a unitary way .",
    "that is the reason of the loss of coherence in a system interacting with an environment composed of a large number of degrees of freedom .",
    "a lot of work has been done to understanding decoherence , dynamics of entanglement , and quantum chaos .",
    "one of the themes is the behavior of entanglement in bipartite quantum systems in the parameter regimes where their underlying classical analogues are chaotic in the sense of exponential sensitivity to small changes in initial conditions .",
    "the basic models of quantum optics and cavity quantum electrodynamics are the jaynes - cummings model @xcite , describing the interaction between a two - level atom at rest and a quantized mode of the radiation field , and the dicke model @xcite , describing the interaction of a collection of two - level atoms , located within a distance much smaller than the radiation wavelength , with a quantized mode of the radiation field .",
    "it is known for a long time @xcite that the classical limit of the dicke model can be chaotic only beyond the rotating - wave approximation .",
    "it has been found that initial increase in the reduced linear entropy is faster for the initial states , prepared as wave packets centered at chaotic regions of the classical phase space , as compared to regular ones @xcite .",
    "the similar property has been found in the model of weakly - coupled quantum tops @xcite and in the model of two - component bose - einstein condensates @xcite .    in the above cited and other similar works , closed quantum systems have been considered , and the connection has been studied between quantum entanglement and dynamical chaos in the classical version of a quantum system under consideration , i.  e.  between two _ different _ systems . however , the classical limit of a quantum system is not unique .",
    "for example , there are different classical limits of the jaynes - cummings model @xcite and its generalization , the dicke model @xcite , which even have different names : neoclassical , quasiclassical , and semiclassical @xcite .",
    "one may treat atoms quantum mechanically and the field classically .",
    "there is a choice how to couple the atoms with their radiation field .",
    "the classical limit can be taken for both the atomic and field subsystems .",
    "as a result , one derives different equations of motion for expectation values of quantum operators for the same physical system whose phase spaces may have different properties .",
    "it is a problem to decide which classical limit is `` the best one '' and should be used for comparison with quantum treatment of the system .    in this paper",
    "we study the connection between the purely quantum characteristics , such as entanglement and fidelity , and classical chaos in _ the same _ system with dynamically coupled quantum and classical degrees of freedom .",
    "the _ quantum dynamics _ of a system with _",
    "classical degrees of freedom _ is of great interest not only from the point of view of quantum chaos but from the view point of the correspondence between quantum and classical mechanics as well .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to show that entanglement between the atomic and field quantum states correlates with the center - of - mass motion of an atom in the standing - wave cavity field .",
    "regular center - of - mass motion corresponds to a regular evolution of the reduced quantum entropy and fidelity of quantum states , whereas quantum evolution is unstable under a chaotic ( random ) walking of the atom .",
    "quantum instability may arise in quantum - classical hybrid without introducing a bath with infinitely many degrees of freedom or any kind of noise to model environment whose role is played in our model by a translational degree of freedom .",
    "we prove that correlations between purely quantum characteristics , such as entanglement and fidelity of the atom - field states , and the classical measure of motion   the maximal lyapunov exponent   arise in a natural way with a two - level atom moving in a single - mode quantized cavity field . by numerical simulation",
    "we demonstrate various manifestations of the quantum - classical correspondence , including dynamical chaos and dynamical fractals , that may be , in principle , found in real experiments with atoms and photons in high finesse cavities .",
    "atoms , interacting with the electromagnetic field , change both their internal electronic states and external translational states , the process known as a photon recoil . in the strong - coupling regime , the respective hamiltonian describes the interaction between the field , electronic , and translational degrees of freedom . in our previous papers @xcite we have studied the hamiltonian dynamics of a two - level atom in a self - consistent standing - wave cavity field in the semiclassical approximation in the limit of an infinite number of photons and found both regular and chaotic regimes of motion of the atomic center of mass .",
    "the chaotic walking of atoms takes place in a stationary standing wave and is quantified by the positive values of the maximal lyapunov exponent @xcite .",
    "typical chaotic atomic trajectories consist of intervals of random walking interrupted by regular oscillations near the bottom of some wells of the optical potential and long ballistic flights with practically constant velocity ( so - called lvy flights @xcite ) . in the language of dynamical system",
    "s theory , there is a fractal - like chaotic invariant set consisting of all chaotic and unstable periodic orbits in the phase space of the strongly coupled atom - field system . as a sequence , a scattering of atoms even at a 1d standing electromagnetic wave is fractal with prominent self - similarity of their scattering function , for example , in dependence of exit time on the atomic initial momentum @xcite .",
    "classical instability is usually defined as an exponential separation of two nearly trajectories in time with an asymptotic rate given by the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath0 .",
    "perfectly isolated quantum systems are unitary and can not be unstable in this sense even if their classical limits are chaotic @xcite .",
    "it has been long ago proposed @xcite to measure quantum instability by the decay of fidelity or overlap of two initially identical wave functions that evolve under slightly different hamiltonians . in a number of numerical studies ( see , for example refs .",
    "@xcite and cited therein ) for a variety of classically chaotic models , it has been found that the overlap decay is , in general , not universal and depends on the strength of perturbations in hamiltonians and other factors determining which decay regime prevails , algebraic , gaussian , or exponential one .",
    "the usual strategy is to compare the fidelity decay to a separation of nearby trajectories in the phase space of a classical analogue of the quantum system under consideration . with our dynamically - coupled quantum - classical hybrid ,",
    "a correlation between quantum and classical measures of instability arises in a natural way as a result of coupling between different characteristics of the same system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ section_main_eqs ] we derive the hamilton - schrdinger nonlinear equations , describing interaction between a two - level atom with the classical translational degree of freedom and a single - mode quantized field in an ideal cavity , and discuss possible regimes of the center - of - mass motion in dependence on the values of the detuning of the atom - field resonance .",
    "we express linear and von neumann entropies ( measures of the atom - field entanglement ) and fidelity ( measure of instability of the jaynes - cummings quantum evolution ) in terms of the respective probability amplitudes . in some cases we find exact and approximate solutions of the equations of motion . in sec .",
    "[ section_fock ] we study correlations between the entanglement and fidelity and the mode of the center - of - mass motion in a fock - state cavity field . in this case",

    "in fact , we deal with entanglement between two similar quantum systems , a two - level atom and a three- ( or two- ) level field .",

    "the strength of chaos , measured by the value of @xmath0 , is the same for both the initial field states @xmath12 and @xmath182 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath183 is regular in a wider range of @xmath132 with atoms in a coherent field ( fig .",
    "[ fig8]c ) than with atoms in a fock field ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) simply because of choosing a specific value of the phase of the coherent state @xmath182 .",
    ".,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we have found ( see fig .  [ fig8 ] )",
    "that with the initial momentum @xmath111 and @xmath114 the type of atomic motion depends strongly on the initial atomic inversion @xmath184 .",
    "if an atom is prepared initially in one of its energetic states , i.  e. @xmath185 , its classical and quantum dynamics are unstable , whereas they are stable with @xmath186 under the same other conditions . in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we show the evolution of the quantity @xmath164 in the regimes of chaotic walking ( thick and thin lines , @xmath185 ) and regular motion ( dotted line , @xmath186 ) with @xmath187 . in the chaotic regime the fidelity initially decays exponentially with the rate @xmath188 to be equal to the maximal lyapunov exponent computed with the set ( [ mainsys ] ) .",
    "this result does not depend on the values of differences in the detuning @xmath82 .",
    "the fidelity practically does not decay in the regular regime at @xmath186 , and the respective maximal lyapunov exponent was computed to be zero .    with randomly walking atoms ,",
    "initial decay of fidelity is practically the same both in the fock ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) and coherent ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) initial field states and is quantified by the respective lyapunov exponents . after reaching zero value",
    ", fidelity demonstrates erratical oscillations in both the cases .",
    "these oscillations are more pronounced with the fock field because entanglement there occurs between a few quantum states , whereas entanglement with a coherent field implies , in principle , an infinite number of states . in any case ,",
    "behavior of fidelity strongly differs with regularly and randomly walking atoms .",
    "we have found the quantum - classical correspondence in the basic model in cavity qed by proving that entanglement between electronic and photonic degrees of freedom and fidelity of the jaynes - cummings dynamics correlate with the center - of - mass motion of a two - level atom in a quantized standing - wave cavity field .",
    "it has been shown analytically and numerically both with initial fock and coherent field states that quantum entropy , purity , and fidelity of regularly moving atoms evolve in a regular way , whereas the respective quantum evolution is unstable with atoms moving chaotically in a periodic standing wave .",
    "instability of the quantum evolution has been shown to be quantified by the respective classical maximal lyapunov exponent for different initial electronic and field states and with different values of the main control parameter , the atom - field detuning @xmath57 .",
    "we emphasize that this quantum instability and irreversibility is caused by internal dynamical chaos and takes place without any external environment .",
    "we have done some numerical experiments and found various manifestations of the quantum - classical correspondence , including dynamical chaos and fractals , which can be , in principle , observed in real experiments with atoms and photons in high - finesse cavities . in this connection",
    ", we should mention first of all pioneering experiments of kimble s and rempe s groups @xcite on real - time position control of a single atom in a high - finesse microcavity where a photon may be periodically absorbed by the atom and re - emitted into the cavity many times before being lost outside the cavity . in the strong - coupling regime , when the coherent coupling between a single atom and intracavity field dominates atomic spontaneous emission and intracavity - field decay , the center - of - mass position within the cavity mode can be monitored in real time with high spatial and temporal evolution by detecting the light transmitted by the cavity .",
    "these achievements open up new possibilities in the control and continuous measurement of the internal and external dynamical variables of atoms .",
