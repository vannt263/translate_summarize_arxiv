    "in certain chains the strong subchain or local disorder can be present generally at arbitrary location in the chain with some small probability that itself depends on the global disorder that describes the statistical ensemble of the couplings .",

    "the slope of the low - gap region is apparently independent of those decimation steps where the original decimation rule fails in perturbative sense .",

    "<S> we introduce variants of the ma - dasgupta renormalization - group ( rg ) approach for random quantum spin chains , in which the energy - scale is reduced by decimation built on either perturbative or non - perturbative principles . in one non - perturbative version of the method </S>",
    "<S> , we require the exact invariance of the lowest gaps , while in a second class of perturbative ma - dasgupta techniques , different decimation rules are utilized . for the @xmath0 random antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain , </S>",
    "<S> both type of methods provide the same type of disorder dependent phase diagram , which is in agreement with density - matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg ) calculations and previous studies . </S>"
