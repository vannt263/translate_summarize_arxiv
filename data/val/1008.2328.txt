    "in this paper we start a program of studies of the nuclear fragmentation in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions using as a starting point an event generator of the nucleon configurations in nuclei which correctly reproduces short - range correlations between the nucleons .",
    "most of the recent experimental and theoretical studies of the relativistic heavy ion collisions were focused on the production of hadrons at central rapidities .",
    "fragmentation of nuclei in these collisions was used only as a supplementary trigger for centrality . at the same time experiments at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic )",
    "have demonstrated that it is possible to determine on the event by event basis impact parameter and reaction plane of the collision .",
    "( there is obviously some inherit uncertainty related to the fluctuations of the observables for collisions at a given impact parameter . ) this opens new opportunities for studies of the nuclear fragmentation which have a long history ; see , for example , ref . @xcite and references therein .",
    "another motivation is the recent direct observation of the short - range correlations ( src ) @xcite in the nuclear decays initiated by a hard removal of the nucleon from the nucleus .",
    "when combined with the scaling of the ratios in @xmath1 @xmath2 nuclear reactions , it demonstrates the important role played by src in nuclear structure ; for a recent review , see ref .",
    "this calls for a description of heavy ion collisions using realistic configurations of nucleons in nuclei going beyond the commonly used collection of nucleons randomly distributed in the nuclear volume .",
    "we started the program of including src in nuclear configurations in ref .",
    "@xcite where we implemented central correlation functions using the metropolis method .",
    "this allowed us to overcome the problem of distortion of single particle density when configurations with nucleons at short distance are simply discarded .",
    "the pair distribution function for the generated configurations is close enough to the realistic one ; in particular , it vanishes when the two nucleons separation approaches zero .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the inclusion of correlations in nuclear configurations was shown to have significant effects on the fluctuations of the average number collisions in @xmath3 scattering ; the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite confirmed the importance of @xmath4 correlations effects on fluctuations in @xmath3 as well as @xmath5 collisions using our central - correlated configurations @xcite within their monte carlo ( mc ) simulations . in this work",
    "we implement the second step of our program : taking into account spin and isospin dependence in the generation of configurations .",
    "this allows us to implement for the first time , the state - dependent correlations ; this procedure is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : mc ] .    in this paper",
    "we apply the mc method for taking into correlation effects in aa collisions at the energies of the cern na49 experiment @xcite , also using results from the lawrence berkeley national laboratory ( lbl ) experiment of ref .",
    "we analyze dependence of nuclear fragmentation on centrality of the collisions . in the data",
    "analyzes the centrality is usually determined based on the the correlation between the observed charged particle multiplicity and the calculated number of participant nucleons in the @xmath5 collision .",
    "this leads to large uncertainties and the impact parameter is usually known in large bins and very central collisions are difficult to identify .",
    "we propose in this work    -6.2 cm 0.2 cm -6.2 cm -12.0 cm    * ( a)(b ) *    5.8 cm    * ( c)(d ) *    5.3 cm    that one can obtain additional information about the centrality of a collision , based on the detailed balance of energy transferred in the collision at a given impact parameter and on the emission of high - momentum nucleons originating from src pair in nuclei .",
    "in addition , the angular asymmetry for emission of nucleons allows us to resolve the sign ambiguity of the direction of impact parameter @xmath0 in contrast with the current procedures which determine only @xmath6 .",
    "we introduce a new model for the description of the emission mechanism of spectator nucleons in ultra - high - energy heavy ion collisions . in this limit , in the rest frame of one of the nuclei ,",
    "the projectile is strongly lorentz contracted to the longitudinal size of the order @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a soft strong interaction scale @xmath9 . as a result , the collision can be considered as the propagation of a `` pancake '' moving with the speed of light which consequently removes nucleons from the target along its path ; the situation is depicted in fig .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the dynamics of nuclear fragmentation at low energies differens significantly ; energy transfers to individual nucleons are small as compared to the scale of energies in src , and the relative velocities of nuclei are small .",
    "this differs markedly from the picture of a thin pancaked nucleus going through the target nucleus we can employ in the ultra - relativistic collisions . for a review of models of fragmentation at low energies , see ref .",
    "the spectator system emerging from the target is left in an unknown excited state . at the first stage the destruction of the potentials between the pairs ( triplets ) of nearby nucleons , one of which is hit and another belongs to the spectator system , release energy on the layer of nucleons adjacent to the removed portion of the nucleus .",
    "this energy comes from the work performed by destruction of the potential energy ( bonds ) associated with the position of these nucleons in the initial wave function , and it can be readily converted into kinetic energy . as a result , they can be emitted into free space in the direction    -0.2 cm        -0.2 cm    of the removed nucleons , or propagate into the spectator system and undergo attenuation .",
    "the remaining available potential energy goes into excitation of the spectator system and it can be released at a later stage by standard nucleon evaporation and decay .",
    "experimental analyses along the lines we suggest in this work are feasible at rhic as presence of the directed flow @xmath10 for neutrons was observed ( though not analyzed in detail ) by the phenix @xcite and star @xcite experiments .",

    "[ sec : mc ] we introduce general definitions and describe our improved procedure for generating nucleon configurations in nuclei , which , in difference from our original procedure , includes spin and isospin nucleon - nucleon correlations .",
    "we also describe the mc procedure for the first stage of the collision which separates nucleons into spectators and interacting nucleons .",
    "it employs the geometry of the glauber description of the collision , which allows an impact - parameter - dependent description and takes into account the basic features of realistic calculations of srcs in the ground state of nuclei @xcite .",
    "( note here that the glauber model forms a basis of many mc codes for the simulation of high energy nucleus - nucleus collisions ; for example , hijing @xcite for the simulation of nucleus - nucleus collisions . ) in our model we use the standard description of hadron - nucleus interactions @xcite , in which inelastic collisions of nuclei are treated as an incoherent superposition of the individual collisions of the nucleons of the two systems .",
    "the participants are defined as the nucleons which interacted inelastically at least once in the @xmath5 collision , and spectators are the nucleons which did not interact .",
    "they are determined within the glauber approximation and the simulation of the collisions is performed starting from random nucleons distributed according to a given probability density for the nucleus profile .    in sec .",

    "[ sec : momdis ] we first describe the algorithm for the selection of correlated nucleons among the nucleons close to the collision surface .",
    "next , we outline the procedure used to generate emission of both high momentum and low - momentum nucleons from the surface .",
    "the soft part of the distribution is due to heating and evaporation of the residual system which includes taking into account extra heating from absorption of the part of the nucleons emitted from the surface by the bulk of the spectator system .",
    "we describe also an additional contribution to the nucleon production due to elastic scattering of nucleons near the surface of the collision which is enhanced for the emission angle close to @xmath14 in the nucleus rest frame .",
    "the section concludes with numerical results for the nucleon momentum distributions .",
    "the relative roles of different mechanisms discussed in the paper is presented as well as and their dependence on the impact parameter .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : angular ] we discuss a novel feature of the proposed mechanism of nucleus fragmentation : the strong angular dependence of the nucleon emission .    -0.2",

    "the subsequent terms which include such third- and higher - order correlations , namely three - body clusters linked by spin and isospin dependent two - body correlations , as well as genuine three - body correlations , will be neglected in the present work . at the same time",
    "the central correlations will be retained to all orders .",
    "this procedure is dictated by the enormous computing power needed for a higher - order calculation and justified by the fact that realistic calculations based on the cluster expansion technique show that higher - order calculations , essential for the accurate determination of quantities such as binding energy and momentum distributions , provides corrections to the bulk properties of the quantities of relevance , namely diagonal one- and radial two - body densities , which are small as compared to the accuracy needed by our study .",

    "@xcite exhibits a change in slope of the momentum distribution of protons as well as a strong change of the shape of the transverse - momentum distribution for nucleons with total energy equal to @xmath122 .",
    "the first effect may be due to the high - momentum , correlated nucleons , as suggested by results of calculations shown in fig .",
    "( b)_. while the second effect is likely to be due to the elastic - scattering mechanism .      here",
    "we return to discussion of @xmath63 and sensitivity of the results to a specific choice of @xmath63 which played an important role in identifying the _ active _ nucleons .",
    "we already gave our rationale for the choice of @xmath123 . an alternative way to determine",
    "@xmath63 is to require that it is equal to the average maximum distance from the nearest interacting nucleons of spectators with potential energy larger than the average @xmath124 .",
    "this definition leads to the value of @xmath125 , which is close to our qualitative expectations . to explore the sensitivity to this parameter",
    "we varied it between 1.8 and 2.2 fm .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the final result for the energy per evaporating nucleon [ [ fig11](a ) ] changes by at most 10% , with an even smaller effect on the momentum distribution for @xmath126 mev/@xmath59 [ [ fig11](b ) ] .",
    "the effect is larger for high momentum nucleons .",
    "however , it should be stressed that reducing @xmath63 to less than 2 fm would produce an unrealistically low number of correlations , since the @xmath4 correlation functions of eq .",
    "( [ corfs ] ) have been shown by many - body calculations ( see the correlation functions in refs . @xcite and @xcite and references therein ) to extend up to relative distances of at least 2 fm .",
    "also , we checked that the variation of @xmath63 leads to a very small modification of the asymmetry of emission , which we discuss in the next section .",
    "one of the aims of this work is to estimate the asymmetry of emerging from the @xmath5 collision .",
    "these nucleons are generated on the inner surface left after the fast propagation of the projectile nucleus ; we define @xmath127 to be the number of nucleons ending up in the hemisphere oriented toward free space and @xmath128 its analog in the opposite hemisphere .",
    "we can define the impact parameter - dependent asymmetry as follows : [ asymdef ] a(b)=. we expect that the few nucleons surviving in a central collision will find little or no matter to propagate through in any direction , resulting in @xmath129 .",

    "[ fig10 ] , for different impact parameters ranging from @xmath130 fm ( top left panel ) to @xmath131 fm ( bottom right panel ) . in the first case of almost central collisions ,",
    "few nucleons are left ; they are far from each other and free to propagate . for increasing @xmath30 , it can be seen how an asymmetry arises in the rest frame of the target nucleus , since nucleons are produced with random momentum direction and they can end up propagating into free space or through the spectator system which prevents emitted nucleons to propagate freely . for a large impact parameter , the asymmetry of eq .",
    "( [ asymdef ] ) which is due only to the correlations should approach the value given by taking @xmath132 , which is the fraction of nucleons surviving after the scatterings through the spectator matter at large impact parameters .",
    "this would result in @xmath133 .",
    "the calculations of @xmath134 performed within our model are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig12 ] and [ fig13 ] and confirm these expectations .",
    "figure  [ fig12 ] shows the asymmetry including nucleons from the different emission mechanisms .",
    "the contribution due to correlations is , as already stated , strongly asymmetric ; elastically scattered nucleons lead to similar asymmetry as they also originate from the surface ; soft nucleons originating from the surface somewhat increase asymmetry . the largest contribution , as far as the number of nucleons is concerned ,",
    "is from the soft , evaporating ones , and makes the total asymmetry much smaller .",
    "figure  [ fig13 ] shows the individual contributions to @xmath135 and @xmath136 from correlated nucleons alone and from the total number of emission of spectator nucleons .",
    "note that for @xmath137 fm we used an extrapolation of the na49 data @xcite for the number of nucleons produced at a given impact parameter for determining the fraction of energy taken from nucleons and fragments , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : momdis ] .    in this analysis we did not take into account the effect of the coulomb interaction between nuclei which gives fragmenting systems of opposite transverse momenta .",
    "the effect gives an asymmetry of the opposite sign than the effect we discussed here .",
    "our effect is large for large nucleon momenta , while the coulomb effect is most important for the lowest momentum neutrons .",
    "we will consider the coulomb effect elsewhere .",
    "we mentioned in the introduction that rhic experiments observed displacement of the core of the neutron shower from the center of the detector .",
    "however , this effect is dominated by low - momentum neutrons and may be more sensitive to the coulomb effect . hence it would be important to study asymmetry separately for different ranges of the neutron momenta as well as study experimentally correlation of the strengths and directions of asymmetries of two fragmentation regions . when the origin of the asymmetry is cleared out it would be possible to use this effect to solve the ambiguity in the sign of the impact parameter @xmath0 . note here , that the correlation of @xmath10 with corresponding asymmetry for hadrons at the rapidities away from the central one was observed at rhic .",
    "however due to the lack of understanding of the origin of the neutron asymmetry it was impossible to use this observation to constrain the current models of @xmath5 collisions at rhic .",
    "we investigated the dependence of the @xmath134 on the cutoff distance from the closest interacting nucleon , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "we find negligible effects on the asymmetry .",
    "this is due to the fact that the emission of correlated nucleons is highly asymmetric , but the asymmetry is dominated by isotropic emissions in any case so the small relative fraction of correlations practically does not affect @xmath134 .",
    "in this section we compare our novel approach for the calculation of the excitation energy of the spectator system with the one employed in ref . @xcite . in the cited ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors use the abrasion - ablation model for hadronic interactions and the relativistic electromagnetic dissociation model for electromagnetic interactions of relativistic heavy ions to describe data of charge - changing cross section in pb-@xmath138 collisions .",
    "in particular they address the question of how to estimate the excitation energy of a nuclear system formed by sudden removal of several nucleons , which is also one of the main aims of the present work , and describe the decay of excited nuclear systems within the statistical multi - fragmentation model .",
    "the abrasion model describes participant and spectator nucleons with participants originating from the overlapping parts of the colliding nuclei , while their non - overlapping parts are treated as spectators which represent excited remnants of the initial nuclei which undergo secondary decay by statistical evaporation and fission models in the so - called ablation model .    the @xmath4 interaction probability in ref .",
    "@xcite is defined through ( uncorrelated ) nuclear thickness functions , while in our approach correlations are taken into account automatically by using improved configurations from ref .",
    "the main difference then consists in the estimate of the spectator system ( prefragment , in the terminology of ref .",
    "@xcite ) excitation energy .",
    "we use similar values of @xmath4 cross sections .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite describe excitation energy by the abrasion model , which basically evaluate the energy due to a hole in the uncorrelated ground state of the initial nucleus , while we use the realistic calculation of sec .",
    "[ sec : pot ] ; moreover , in ref .",
    "@xcite it is explicitly mentioned that the procedure is not well defined for a large number of removed nucleons and that their method of calculating excitation energies of prefragments via the hole state densities should be considered only as a model assumption .",
    "a comparison with other approaches was also done in ref .",
    "@xcite , finding for the excitation energy per nucleon a value of @xmath139 mev using the ablation model and @xmath140 mev using a more refined formula , the latter estimate being confirmed by data ; we note that the value of @xmath140 mev is in good agreement with our findings of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , where this value is just about our estimate for @xmath141 - 4 fm ; we believe that one of the important improvement of our approach is precisely the possibility of giving an impact - parameter dependent estimate of the excitation energy , which was untouched by any of the previous approaches . as a last remark ,",
    "let us stress that in ref .",
    "@xcite it was mentioned that their model should be complemented with fsi , which we take into account in our estimate of the energy per nucleon , and the additional energy brought in by elastically scattered primary nucleons subsequently absorbed by the spectator system , which we also considered .",
    "we have demonstrated that the underlying dynamics of the process of the nucleus fragmentation in high energy nucleus - nucleus collisions is strongly related to the the presence of short - range correlations in nuclei .",
    "we predict a number of new phenomena which could be tested in the current and forthcoming heavy ion experiments , including the dependence of the momentum spectrum on the impact parameter strong asymmetry of the emission nucleons along the @xmath30 direction .",
    "such an asymmetry as well as other predicted effects may be of use for more detailed analyses of dynamics of the heavy ion collisions .",
    "in particular , it would allow one to investigate whether similar asymmetry is present for the hadrons produced in @xmath5 collisions away from zero center of mass rapidity .",
    "we also predict a close connection of the spectrum of nucleons in the central collisions and momentum distribution in the nuclei .",
    "we are now in the process of implementing the discussed effects in a complete mc event generator of @xmath5 collisions and results will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
