    "here i summarize the central results described in a single long parallel session talk , which was comprised of two distinct studies of lattice qcd .",
    "the first of these is concerned with the direct lattice calculation of the landua gauge nonperturbative gluon propagator , an understanding of which is central to our understanding of the nature of confinement .",
    "the second topic is a lattice calculation of the strangeness magnetic moment of the nucleon .",
    "different confining quark models predict a variety of results for this quantity and so lattice calculations provide a benchmark against which we can test our understanding of hadron structure .",
    "the infrared behaviour of the gluon propagator is important for an understanding of confinement .",
    "previous conjectures range from a strong divergence  @xcite to a propagator that vanishes in the infrared  @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd should in principle be able to resolve this issue by first - principles , model - independent calculations . however , lattice studies have been inconclusive up to now,@xcite since they have not been able to access sufficiently low momenta",
    ". the lower limit of the available momenta on the lattice is given by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the length of the lattice . here",
    "we will report results using a lattice with a length of 3.3  fm in the spatial directions and 6.7  fm in the time direction .",
    "this gives us access to momenta as small as 400  mev .",
    "the gluon field @xmath6 can be extracted from the link variables @xmath7 using @xmath8 .",
    "inverting and fourier transforming this , we obtain a _ ( ) & & _ x e^-i(x+/2 ) a_(x+/2 ) + & = & , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the available momentum values @xmath11 are given by @xmath12 , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the number of points in the @xmath15 direction .",
    "the gluon propagator @xmath16 is defined as @xmath17 .",
    "the landau gauge propagator in the continuum has the structure @xmath18d(q^2)$ ] . at tree level",
    ", @xmath19 will have the form @xmath20 . on the lattice , this becomes d^(0 ) ( ) = 1/_()^2 .",
    "[ eq : lat - tree ] since qcd is asymptotically free , we expect that up to logarithmic corrections , @xmath21 in the ultraviolet .",
    "hence we define the new momentum variable @xmath22 by @xmath23 and work with this throughout .",
    "the ( bare ) lattice gluon propagator is related to the renormalised continuum propagator @xmath24 via @xmath25 .",
    "the renormalisation constant @xmath26 can be found by imposing a momentum subtraction renormalisation condition @xmath27 .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the renormalised gluon propagator in the continuum is given to one - loop level by @xmath28^{-d_d}$ ] with @xmath29=13/44 $ ] , where both the gauge parameter @xmath30 and the number of fermion flavours @xmath31 are zero in this calculation .",
    "we have analysed three lattices , with different values for the volume and lattice spacing .",
    "the details are given in table  [ tab : sim - params ] . in the following , we are particularly interested in the deviation of the gluon propagator from the tree level form .",
    "we will therefore factor out the tree level behaviour and plot @xmath32 rather than @xmath19 itself .",
    ".simulation parameters [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,>,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we have evaluated the gluon propagator on an asymmetric lattice with a large physical volume . by studying the anisotropies in the data , and comparing the data with those from a smaller lattice , we have been able to conclude that finite size effects are under control on the large lattice .",
    "a clear turnover in the behaviour of @xmath32 has been observed at @xmath33gev , indicating that the gluon propagator diverges less rapidly than @xmath34 in the infrared , and may be infrared finite or vanishing .",
    "the data are consistent with a functional form @xmath35 , where d_ir = , [ eq : ir - prop ] @xmath36 gev , and @xmath37 is the appropriate asymptotic form .",
    "a more detailed analysis  @xcite of the asymptotic behaviour reveals that the one - loop formula remains insufficient at @xmath38 .",
    "issues for future study include the effect of gribov copies and of dynamical fermions .",
    "we also hope to use improved actions to perform realistic simulations at larger lattice spacings .",
    "this would enable us to evaluate the gluon propagator on larger physical volumes , giving access to lower momentum values .",
    "we summarize some recent results @xcite on nucleon electromagentic form factors , including the strangeness electric and magnetic form factors .",
    "the strangeness content of the nucleon has been a topic of considerable recent interest for a variety of reasons .",
    "the studies of nucleon spin structure functions in polarized deep inelastic scattering experiments at cern and slac @xcite , combined with neutron and hyperon @xmath39 decays , have turned up a surprisingly large and negative polarization from the strange quark .",
    "in addition , there is a well - known long - standing discrepancy between the pion - nucleon sigma term extracted from the low energy pion - nucleon scattering  @xcite and that from the octect baryon masses  @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy can be reconciled if a significant @xmath40 content in the nucleon  @xcite is admitted . to address some of these issues , an experiment to measure the neutral weak magnetic form factor @xmath41 via elastic parity - violating electron scattering at backward angles was recently carried out by the sample collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the strangeness magnetic form factor is obtained by subtracting out the nucleon magnetic form factors @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the reported value is @xmath44gev@xmath45 and does not yet provide a strong constraint on the sign .",
    "theoretical predictions of @xmath46 vary widely .",
    "the values from various models and analyses range from @xmath47 in a qcd equalities analysis  @xcite to @xmath48 in an @xmath49 chiral bag model  @xcite .",
    "while a few give positive values  @xcite , most model predictions are negative with a typical range of @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
    "summaries of these predictions can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite a similar situation exists for the strangeness electric mean - square radius @xmath3 .",
    "a number of the predictions are positive while a few are negative .",
    "elastic @xmath52 and @xmath53 parity - violation experiments are currently planned at tjnaf  @xcite to measure the asymmetry @xmath54 at forward angles to extract @xmath3 .",
    "hopefully , they will settle the issue of its sign .",
    "the lattice formulation of the electromagnetic and other form factors has been given in detail in the past  @xcite .",
    "here , we shall concentrate on the di contribution , where the strangeness current contributes . in the euclidean formulation",
    ", the sachs em form factors can be obtained by the combination of two- and three - point functions @xmath55 @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the nucleon interpolating field and @xmath58 the vector current . with large euclidean time separation , i.e. @xmath59 and @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the lattice spacing , @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we shall use the conserved current from the wilson action which , being point - split , yields slight variations on the above forms and these are given in ref .",
    "@xcite our 50 quenched gauge configurations were generated on a @xmath65 lattice at @xmath66 . in the time direction ,",
    "fixed boundary conditions were imposed on the quarks to provide larger time separations than available with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we also averaged over the directions of equivalent lattice momenta in each configuration ; this has the desirable effect of reducing error bars .",
    "numerical details of this procedure are given in refs .",
    "@xcite the dimensionless nucleon masses @xmath67 for @xmath68 , 0.152 , and 0.148 are 0.738(16 ) , 0.882(12 ) , and 1.15(1 ) respectively .",
    "the corresponding dimensionless pion masses @xmath69 are 0.376(6 ) , 0.486(5 ) , and 0.679(4 ) . extrapolating the nucleon and pion masses to the chiral limit we determine @xmath70 and @xmath71 . using the nucleon mass to set the scale to study nucleon properties  @xcite ,",
    "the lattice spacing @xmath72 gev is determined .",
    "the three @xmath73 then correspond to quark masses of about 120 , 200 , and 360 mev respectively .",
    "the strangeness current @xmath74 contribution appears in the di only .",
    "the full details of the extraction can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and we satisfy ouselves here by simply quoting the results .",
    "we use a monopole form to extrapolate @xmath75 with nonzero @xmath76 to @xmath77 , giving @xmath78 .",
    "correlations are taken into account and the error is from jackknifing the fitting procedure .",
    "a similar analysis is done for the strange sachs electric form factor @xmath79 and we find that @xmath80 is consistent with zero as it should be .",
    "we find for the electric mean - square radius @xmath81 .",
