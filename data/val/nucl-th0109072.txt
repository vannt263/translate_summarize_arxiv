    "the binding energy of hyperons in nuclear matter plays an important role in hypernuclei and in the equation of state of neutron stars .",
    "the most commonly used approach is that one starts from a two - body hyperon - nucleon potential based upon one - boson exchange ( obe ) and su(3)-flavor symmetry and then computes the binding of hyperons in matter in the brueckner approximation .",
    "it has been shown that uncertainties in the two - body input may lead to large differences in the resulting hyperon potentials and in particular in the binding of the sigma hyperons @xcite .",
    "therefore it is appropriate to see whether other approaches , e.g.a low - density expansion based on vacuum scattering amplitudes can provide additional insight .    alternatively , savage and wise @xcite have analyzed hyperon mass shifts in nuclear matter using chiral perturbation theory by expanding in the fermi momentum .",
    "the interactions were determined by a chiral lagrangian with @xmath1 symmetry ; the hyperon mass shifts could be expressed in terms of six coefficients related to the strength of the four - baryon contact interactions and the pseudoscalar - meson couplings to baryons and were computed at the one - loop level . however , the unknown values of these six parameters prevented them from obtaining numerical results for the energy shift at zero momentum .",
    "more recently , applications of effective field theory ( eft ) in nuclear physics have received a renewed interest ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "so far , most investigations have been devoted to the two - nucleon system @xcite , which is characterized by anomalously large scattering lengths .",
    "the existence of quasi - bound states introduces an additional scale in the problem , complicating the power counting required in eft .",
    "a remedy was recently proposed @xcite in the form of a selective resummation .",
    "the leading - order amplitude of this approach reproduces the effective - range expansion with a vanishing range parameter @xcite .",
    "inclusion of the next - to - leading order terms produces a non - zero effective range .",
    "it is tempting to study whether the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite can be applied to the hyperon - nucleon sector which involves coupled channels , i.e.  the scattering length and the effective range are represented by matrices . since our region of application ( center - of - mass momenta below 100 mev/@xmath2 ) is below the pion cut , and in view of the problems encountered with perturbative pions @xcite , we use an approach without explicit mesons .",
    "thus the two - baryon interaction to leading order involves 6 constant contact terms , since su(3)@xmath3su(3 ) can be decomposed into the sum of 6 irreducible representations of su(3 ) . for the s - waves we consider ,",
    "the next - to - leading ( nlo ) order introduces 6 additional su(3)-symmetry respecting coefficients for the terms of order @xmath4 .",
    "the absence of experimental information on @xmath5 scattering means that the low - energy hyperon - nucleon data in the present approach depend only on 10 ( out of these 12 ) parameters .    as discussed in the following sections , breaking of su(3 ) symmetry by meson masses",
    "has significant consequences .",
    "we model this symmetry breaking by incorporating terms of order @xmath4 coming from one - pion exchange .",
    "the two coefficients of these terms we treat as free parameters , resulting in a total of 12 parameters .    in section",
    "ii we formulate the coupled - channels formalism , based on effective field theory , for low - energy hyperon - nucleon scattering . in section",
    "iii we present results of the fit to @xmath6 cross sections and @xmath7 scattering lengths .",
    "some information on the latter is provided by the calculation of the hypertriton binding energy @xcite .",
    "results for the hyperon mass shifts in low - density nuclear medium and their comparison to results obtained by other methods are presented in section iv .",
    "we consider hyperon - nucleon scattering at low energy and use the approach of effective field theory .",
    "in general the tree - level amplitude in next - to - leading order is written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote matrices whose elements are the relevant coefficients in the interaction lagrangian .    the kaplan - savage - wise ( ksw ) resummation @xcite gives , in leading order , a scattering amplitude @xmath11 given by @xmath12 with @xmath13 the reduced baryon mass ( for which we take a common value in all channels ) and @xmath14 the ( arbitrary ) subtraction point . using the relation between the @xmath15-matrix and the full amplitude @xmath11 , viz .",
    "@xmath16 we obtain for the ksw resummation @xmath17 by expanding the term @xmath18 in powers of @xmath4 we recover the effective - range expansion @xmath19 where the scattering - length matrix @xmath20 and effective - range matrix @xmath21 are given by @xmath22 to accomodate possibly large values of the scattering length in the momentum expansion of the amplitude one should keep all powers of @xmath23 .",
    "this leads to the following expression for the amplitude in nlo : @xmath24.\\ ] ] this is a generalization of the single - channel expression , cf .",
    "( 2.18 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , to coupled channels .",
    "next we turn to the relationship between elements of the tree - level amplitude matrix @xmath9 , corresponding to the two - baryon scattering amplitudes of interest . for the spin-1/2 baryon octet",
    "it is convenient to express the 6 real parameters determining the constant four - baryon contact interactions through coefficients corresponding to the 6 irreducible representations of the direct product su(3)@xmath3su(3 ) , which is appropriate for baryon - baryon scattering .",
    "we write the coefficients of the terms in the lagrangian for b@xmath25b@xmath26b@xmath27b@xmath28 in the form @xmath29 , where @xmath30 mev can be identified with the pion decay constant and @xmath31 or 1 denotes the total spin . introducing the notation @xmath32 for the coefficients of the representations [ 1 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 8@xmath33 , [ @xmath34 , [ 10 ] , [ 8@xmath35 , respectively , we list the @xmath36 values of interest ( we note that some of them are given in ref .",

( [ lpcoeff ] ) , except for an overall sign change for @xmath46 and @xmath47 , compared to @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "all coefficients @xmath36 are subtraction - point dependent .",
    "the coefficients of the @xmath4 term @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ pkmin ] ) , which we denote by @xmath50 ( apart from the common factor @xmath51 to make these coefficients dimensionless ) , obey the same relationships as in eq .",
    "( [ lpcoeff ] ) , since the latter are valid for the full momentum - dependent s - wave amplitudes @xcite . hence they are valid for the momentum expansion terms and also for tree - level amplitudes , since the loop expansion corresponds to an expansion in powers of @xmath52 .",
    "let us briefly discuss the breaking of the su(3)-flavor symmetry ( keeping su(2)-isospin symmetry ) . in a study of its significance",
    "it is concluded @xcite that , apart from consequences of the pseudoscalar - meson mass differences and the baryon mass differences the su(3 ) symmetry is satisfied quite well .",
    "the differences in baryon masses we take explicitly into account . the symmetry breaking due to different meson masses is modeled by considering one - pion exchange ( i.e.  ignoring the kaon and the eta ) . to be consistent with the above nlo approach without mesons , we expand the exchange amplitude and keep only the leading , order @xmath4 , term .",
    "this basically leads to addition of a symmetry - breaking term @xmath53 to tree - level amplitude , eq .",
    "( [ treeamplitude ] ) , depending on two parameters , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the relevant coefficients in the spin - singlet channel are the following : @xmath56 the spin - triplet coefficients are obtained by multiplying the above values with @xmath57 . for the channels",
    "@xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 the only difference is in the sign of the term @xmath58 compared to @xmath59 .",
    "we now turn to the available low - energy data on hyperon - nucleon scattering . we consider only scattering with laboratory momenta below 200 mev / c , i.e.  center - of - mass momenta less than 100 mev / c .",
    "there is only a small amount of relevant data , corresponding to total cross sections for @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 scattering ( see , for example ref .",
    "it has been known for a long time @xcite that these available data do not allow a unique effective - range analysis .",
    "the most precisely determined quantity is the `` capture ratio at rest '' , @xmath65 with @xmath66 where the cross sections are taken at zero momentum and @xmath67 denotes the total spin .    when fitting the calculated cross sections to the data we make two corrections , following ref .",
    "first , the @xmath68 transitions are kinematically suppressed relative to @xmath63 , as a consequence of the large momentum release , which at threshold is 290 mev/@xmath2 . according to @xcite",
    "this necessitates inclusion of a correction factor @xmath69.16 in the calculated cross section for @xmath64 .",
    "the second correction concerns the non - negligible contribution of the @xmath70s@xmath71d@xmath25 transition in the experimentally measured cross section @xmath72 . defining the ratio @xmath73 of @xmath70s@xmath71d@xmath25 to @xmath70s@xmath71s@xmath25 cross sections for @xmath74 , a value of @xmath75 was estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we first attempted a fit of 28 data points ( the cross sections shown in fig .  1 . and the capture ratio @xmath76 ) with the leading - order calculation involving the 5 parameters @xmath77 , varying the value of the subtraction point @xmath14 .",
    "in this leading - order calculation we could not achieve a reasonable fit .",
    "then we turned to the next - to - leading - order computation , which added the 5 su(3)-symmetry respecting parameters @xmath78 , as well as the 2 symmetry breaking ones , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "as further constraint we used the existence of the hypertriton bound state @xcite , which is compatible with the obe potential nsc97f of ref .",
    "the advantage of this @xcite is that while the scattering data are mainly sensitive to the @xmath70s@xmath25 @xmath7 interaction , the hypertriton is more sensitive to the @xmath79s@xmath80 @xmath7 interaction .",
    "thus we imposed as requirement on the fit that it had to lead to @xmath81-nucleon scattering lengths of @xmath82 fm for the singlet , and @xmath83 fm for the triplet state , respectively .",
    "several fits of the same quality , @xmath84 being around 13 ( for 16 degrees of freedom ) could be obtained .",
    "if a fit was obtained for a certain value of the subtraction point @xmath14 , it is possible to vary @xmath14 in the range of 0.1 gev to 0.3 gev , leading to practically unchanged scattering amplitudes and thus the same medium effects .",
    "we do not consider members of such a family of fits as different .",
    "the slight change in @xmath84 corresponds to variation ( in a certain range ) of the parameters of terms proportional to @xmath4 in the tree amplitudes , thus changing the effective - range values .",
    "this is not surprising considering the rather large error bars on the measured cross sections . as a consequence ,",
    "the parameters @xmath85 are not very well determined allowing fits with different effective - range values .",
    "our experience shows that all these fits lead to quite similar scattering amplitudes and predictions for in - medium mass shifts .",
    "our strategy in dealing with these fits is to accept only those which do not imply spurious ( quasi-)bound states ( `` hyperdeuterons '' ) near threshold .",
    "for example , a fit with the lowest @xmath84 led to negative effective range in the spin - singlet @xmath86 channel , @xmath87 fm . together with the corresponding scattering length @xmath88",
    "fm it would imply @xcite a bound state with binding energy of 3.3 mev , which is known not to exist .",
    "therefore we rejected this fit .",
    "with @xmath89 we obtained a fit with reasonable values of the range parameters and @xmath7 scattering lengths close to values of model nsc97f in ref .",
    "the corresponding set ( denoted by a ) of parameters is the following : @xmath90 gev , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the resulting cross sections are shown in fig .  1",
    ". the calculated value of the capture ratio is @xmath93 , the @xmath7 scattering lengths and range parameters are : @xmath94 fm , @xmath95 fm , @xmath96 fm , @xmath97 fm . for @xmath60 scattering",
    "we obtain then : @xmath98 fm , @xmath99 fm , @xmath100 fm , @xmath101 fm .",
    "these values are quite different from those of model nsc97f .    fig .  1 : results of the fit ( line ) to @xmath6 cross sections with parameter set a.    our results high - light one of the main problems with the available hyperon - nucleon scattering data ( apart from the large error bars ) : the absence of truly low - energy cross sections . fig .",
    "1 shows that the lowest hyperon ( laboratory ) momentum is larger than 100 mev/@xmath2 , which means that the reciprocal of the scattering length and the range term , @xmath102 , can be of the same order .",
    "this leads to results for the scattering lengths and effective ranges that are not unique .",
    "we mention that we could not obtain a satisfactory fit to the data with both @xmath81-nucleon and @xmath103-proton scattering lengths being close to the values given in ref .  @xcite .",
    "since we have dealt only with the low - momentum expansion of the hyperon - nucleon interaction , we can only consider hyperon self - energies in the nuclear medium in a low - density expansion @xcite .",
    "a simple expression relates the in - medium mass shift ( i.e. the self - energy at zero momentum ) to the hyperon - nucleon scattering lengths @xcite , viz .",
    "@xmath104,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the reduced mass and @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) is the neutron ( proton ) density .",
    "a better approximation is obtained when one takes into account the fermi motion of the nucleons , which amounts to integrating the momentum - dependent forward - scattering amplitude in the nucleon fermi sea . in this case one",

    "since our fits to cross sections extend only up to momenta of 200 mev/@xmath2 , that leads to a maximum density of 0.4@xmath111 for the case of isospin - symmetric matter and 0.2@xmath111 for neutron matter ( @xmath112 is the saturation density ) .",
    "results for hyperon mass shifts for the parameter set a are shown in fig .  2 for isospin - symmetric matter ( a ) , and pure neutron matter ( b ) .      the results for the @xmath81 mass shift in fig .",
    "2(a ) are similar to those obtained in refs .  @xcite using the brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) method with the obe potential from ref .",
    "@xcite , except that there the linear behavior holds up to 0.2@xmath111 , after which nonlinear behavior , leading eventually to saturation , sets in . for the @xmath113 mass shift",
    "the results differ , since in ref .",
    "@xcite a small mass decrease is found at small nucleon density .",
    "we mention that the hypertriton calculation @xcite shows that the hyperon in @xmath114h is a @xmath81 with probability greater than 95% , thus the behavior of the @xmath113 in nuclear medium has a very small effect on the binding energy .",
    "results for neutron matter can not be compared directly with those of the bhf method ( and potentials used ) , since only larger densities were considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , as well as in ref .",
    "low - density results @xcite show linear behavior until about @xmath115 and striking differences for different potentials .",
    "mass shifts based on parameter set a , fig .",
    "2(b ) , show similar behavior to these bhf results @xcite , with the difference that the latter predict the @xmath116 curve below that of @xmath117 .",
    "we mention that in this case , because of isospin - symmetry violation in the neutron matter , the nondiagonal mass shift @xmath118 is nonzero and quite large for our parameter values , leading to strong repulsion of the @xmath81 and @xmath116 curves . without this repulsion we would recover the `` natural '' ordering ( in increasing mass shift ) of the @xmath119 curves .",
    "also , the bhf calculations seem to prefer a mass decrease for the @xmath113-hyperons ( except for @xmath117 and , depending on the potential , also for @xmath116 ) , compared to our repulsion .",
    "we conclude that due to the scarce scattering data the predicted hyperon mass shifts in the nuclear medium are somewhat uncertain , but the uncertainty can be partly eliminated using conclusions from the existence of the hypertriton bound state and imposing a constraint of reasonable effective - range values , thus avoiding spurious hyperon - nucleon bound states .",
    "computations in the bhf scheme provide more reliable results for larger densities , but they suffer from serious ambiguities stemming from the use of different potentials , all of which describe the scattering data equally well .",
