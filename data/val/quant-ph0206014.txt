    "charles darwin explained the evolution of living organisms on the basis of the observation that only the species best adapted to their surroundings survive in a competitive environment .",
    "this idea , paraphrased as `` survival of the fittest '' , has since become the cornerstone of evolutionary theories .",
    "the idea has been refined over the years , and we now understand its genetic underpinnings .",
    "hereditary transmission of genetic information is not perfect , and occasional errors in dna replication produce mutations of living organisms .",
    "the mutated organism is in essentially the same environment as the original one , and both have to compete for the available resources .",
    "the resources are limited , and so the organism that can use them more efficiently obtains an edge over its competitors .",
    "the net result is that if the mutation improves the ability of the organism to survive , the mutated organism grows in number , otherwise it fades away . in this mechanism ,",
    "the mutations are not conscious adaptations .",
    "they occur randomly  as a matter of fact most of them fail  but once in a while they modify the organism in the right manner and improve the chances of its survival . if the intermediate steps are glossed over , the outcome looks like a solution to the optimisation problem , with the organisms adapting to the selection pressures exerted by the environment .",
    "all this is fairly logical , and can be illustrated by many examples ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "my aim here is to quantify this mechanism using a simple evolutionary model .",
    "more specifically , i consider the situation where a number of species are dependent on a common physical resource , say food .",
    "( this leaves out predator - prey conflicts where one species may become another s resource . )",
    "when the resource is available in plenty , there is hardly any competition , and all species prosper .",
    "the rate of growth of a species is then proportional to its population , and so all populations grow exponentially .",
    "this typically happens in the early stage of evolution of a new species .",
    "no resource is unlimited , however , even if it is continuously regenerated ( e.g. food availability ultimately depends on sunlight ) .",
    "a time comes when competition for the resource is inevitable . in the later stage of evolution , therefore , one species can prosper only at the expense of another , and eventually populations stabilise .    such a situation can be described by a set of linear evolution equations .",
    "( quad - ratic evolution equations are more appropriate in a predator - prey setting . )",
    "let the index @xmath0 label a set of coexisting species in a given environment , and let @xmath1 denote their populations at time @xmath2 .",
    "then the discrete time evolution of the populations can be written as a matrix equation ( generically @xmath3 is not symmetric ) , @xmath4 the fact that the next generation populations must arise from the present generation ones , even in case of mutations , makes this equation homogeneous .",
    "the diagonal terms @xmath5 represent the individual rates of growth , while the off - diagonal terms @xmath6 represent interactions between species . as mentioned above ,",
    "when the resource is available in plenty , the populations evolve according to : @xmath7 the interesting situation is the competitive stage , where the populations become interdependent due to mutual interactions and the nature of the interactions ( para - metrised by @xmath6 ) determines how they evolve .",
    "to analyse the competitive stage , let us choose normalisations such that a unit population of any species consumes the same amount of resource , and the total resource available at any time is one .",
    "then we have the conservation laws : @xmath8 the constraint on @xmath9 arises because the total population supported by a fixed resource is fixed . when applied to both sides of eq.(1 ) , it yields the constraint on @xmath10 as a consistency condition .",
    "the continuity of evolution in time implies that @xmath11 the matrix @xmath12 , describing the change in populations , clearly shows that what is gained by some species is lost by some others .",
    "obviously @xmath6 can take positive as well as negative values . as a matter of fact ,",
    "situations of both positive and negative interactions occur routinely in biological systems ( e.g. catalysis and inhibition , symbiosis and parasitic behaviour , defence mechanisms and cancer , etc . ) .",
    "situations of this type , where there is no net gain or loss , have been formally called zero sum games . in the conventional form of zero sum games , a multitude of strategies",
    "are available to the players , and competition amongst the players leads them to choose a stable strategy .",
    "this stable strategy turns out to be a `` mini - max solution '' , i.e. each player chooses the strategy that maximises his minimum gain @xcite .",
    "no player can improve his performance by unilaterally departing from this stable strategy , and the explicit solution can be obtained by linear programming methods .",
    "the model described by eqs.(1 ) and ( 3 ) is somewhat different .",
    "first , in the evolutionary context , the strategies are not actively chosen but are created by random mutations . also competition for the resource",
    "is guaranteed , because mutations produce closely related species in the same environment .",
    "it is then of importance to study the dynamics of the system to understand how the incorrect strategies are eliminated and the correct ones are selected .",
    "that requires not just the evaluation of the stable solution but also the manner in which it is approached .",
    "second , the quantitative gains and losses of various species depend not only on the choice of strategy but also on their current populations . in a sense",
    ", the more populous species gets more chances to grab the resources , and that alters the final outcome of the competition .",
    "let us first look at the simpler situation when @xmath13 .",
    "eqs.(1 ) and ( 3 ) then describe stochastic evolution of probability distributions , which has been extensively studied ( see for instance @xcite ) . the linear evolution is a markov chain , which in the generic case is ergodic and converges to a unique stationary distribution .",
    "( if the matrix @xmath3 has a block - diagonal structure , then each block can be studied independently . ) to see this , consider the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath14 as @xmath15 . at every iteration",
    ", @xmath16 is the weighted average of @xmath17 @xmath18 with weights @xmath19 .",
    "the process of repeated averaging converges to the fixed point , @xmath20 with all rows identical , @xmath21 has only one non - vanishing eigenvalue , equal to one .",
    "it follows that @xmath3 has the leading eigenvalue @xmath22 corresponding to the stationary distribution , and remaining eigenvalues @xmath23 corresponding to transient distributions .",
    "the left and right eigenvectors for the leading eigenvalue are , @xmath24 the left and right eigenvectors satisfy the orthogonality relation , @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "all transient distributions are orthogonal to @xmath27 and necessarily contain negative components .",
    "the next - to - leading eigenvalue @xmath28 provides the rate of convergence towards the stationary distribution , and can be obtained my maximising @xmath29 , with the vectors @xmath30 and @xmath31 orthogonal to @xmath32 and @xmath27 respectively , and @xmath33 .",
    "the convergence is monotonic because @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "all these properties belong to altruistic evolution , since @xmath36 while @xmath37 . in the competitive case",
    ", some of the @xmath38 , and the consequences need to be analysed .",
    "the presence of both positive and negative contributions produces cancellations .",
    "monotonic convergence is no longer automatic ; oscillations and instabilities may occur in stead .",
    "an important restriction is imposed by the physical requirement that no population can become negative .",
    "( note that there is no such requirement on the components of the individual eigenvectors of @xmath3 . )",
    "the evolution must be modified whenever it drives some @xmath9 negative .",
    "the correct procedure is to stop the evolution at the instance @xmath9 becomes zero , eliminate @xmath39 row and column from the matrix @xmath3 , and then continue evolution in the reduced dimensional space .",
    "obviously , @xmath9 can be driven negative only if some @xmath6 is negative .",
    "the reduction of dimensionality , therefore , decreases the number of negative @xmath10 and increases the stability of the system .",
    "the inverse process , increasing dimensionality of the space , occurs when chance mutation creates a new species .",
    "it is known that even with @xmath13 , eq.(1 ) can not be evolved backward in time _",
    "indefinitely_. this is true in spite of the fact that generic stochastic matrices are positive definite and @xmath40 exists .",
    "if backward evolution is attempted , some @xmath9 is driven negative at some stage , and beyond that point interpretation of @xmath9 as populations ( or probabilities ) is lost .",
    "evolution further back in time is possible only by modifying @xmath3 .",
    "this is easy to see because eigenvalues of @xmath40 are the reciprocals of those for @xmath3 , and with @xmath41 , the growing transient distributions drive some @xmath9 out of their physically allowed range @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "it is useful to compare this evolution problem to quantum algorithms .",
    "both are constrained by conservation laws .",
    "while eq.(3 ) preserves the linear norm of the vector , quantum evolution preserves the quadratic norm .",
    "the most general evolution preserving the quadratic norm is described by orthogonal transformations for real variables , and by unitary transformations for complex variables .",
    "orthogonal transformations are generated by antisymmetric matrices ( generating matrices parametrise infinitesimal group transformations in the neighbourhood of identity ) , and they inevitably contain negative matrix elements  the negative elements are an automatic consequence of the underlying conservation laws .",
    "( only orthogonal transformations without any negative matrix elements are simple permutation matrices . )",
    "although complete understanding of quantum evolution requires use of complex numbers , classical language extended to include negative probabilities can explain unusual features of certain simple systems ( e.g. quantum correlations of two spins violating bell s inequalities ) @xcite .",
    "recent developments in algorithms for quantum computation ( see for instance @xcite ) offer a hint of how evolution may change in presence of negative matrix elements .",
    "classical algorithms based on boolean logic can be expressed in terms of permutation matrices .",
    "quantum algorithms exploit two features to beat them , superposition of states ( which is a generic property of waves ) and quantum entanglement ( which is not relevant here ) .",
    "superposition means letting multiple states be in the same place at the same time , and it can reduce the spatial degrees of freedom required for the algorithm exponentially . cleverly designed destructive interference amongst superposed states can reduce the the time required to execute the algorithm by eliminating unwanted states .",
    "coexistence of species in biological evolution is not quite the same as superposition ; it allows simultaneous evolution of all species but without reducing the spatial degrees of freedom . but destructive interference is still an option available to reduce the evolution time .",
    "the known quantum algorithms reduce the execution time compared to their classical counterparts , at least by a constant factor if not polynomially or exponentially .",
    "it is important to note that biological evolution occurs over long time scales , and even a tiny change in the rate of growth  fraction of a percent  matters because that can translate into exponential changes in populations over a long time .",
    "the lessons learnt from quantum computation thus suggest that negative values of @xmath10 may create destructive interference and help the species reach their asymptotic populations faster , i.e. competition should beat altruism in picking a winner amongst the contenders .",
    "let us now explicitly analyse how evolution changes , when the range of @xmath6 is extended to include negative values .",
    "clearly , extending the range of @xmath10 can not make the evolutionary process any less powerful .",
    "the stationary eigenvalue of @xmath3 , @xmath43 , which follows just from the averaging properties as described above , remains unaffected .",
    "but other eigenvalues and eigenvectors change , and modify evolution .",
    "an example with two interacting species illustrates the possibilities . in this case , the solution of eq.(1 ) in terms of the ( unnormalised ) right eigenvectors of the evolution matrix is : @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 are small , @xmath47 .",
    "the evolutionary behaviour depends on their signs : + ( a ) @xmath48 : the asymptotic population is proportional to @xmath32 . @xmath49 and",
    "the transient part proportional to @xmath50 fades away .",
    "the two species coexist , and their population ratio is stable against small perturbations . such a behaviour does not occur in quantum algorithms .",
    "+ ( b ) @xmath51 : both @xmath32 and @xmath50 contain negative components , and so the non - negative population vector has to be a mixture of the two .",
    "in course of evolution , the population @xmath9 with @xmath38 is monotonically driven to zero .",
    "thereafter evolution has to continue in the reduced dimensional space .",
    "+ ( c ) @xmath52 : the eigenvalue @xmath53 , and dominance of @xmath50 drives one of the @xmath9 to zero . the relative size of initial populations ( i.e. comparison of @xmath54 vs. @xmath55 ) determines which @xmath9 is driven to zero .",
    "afterwards evolution has to continue in the reduced dimensional space .",
    "such a dependence on the initial populations is quite distinct from the `` mini - max analysis '' .",
    "these results for two interacting species have a topological interpretation .",
    "the three regimes can be looked upon as minimisation of a function over an interval , when it ( a ) has a single minimum , ( b ) is monotonic , and ( c ) has a single maximum .",
    "the relation between linear evolution and gradient of a quadratic form is generic , and the features exhibited in the above example can be expected to generalise to more complicated multi - species systems . specifically , whenever some @xmath38 : + ( 1 ) the non - stationary eigenvectors play an important part in evolution .",
    "+ ( 2 ) having any @xmath38 makes the stationary eigenvector unstable , and drives the system towards reduced dimensionality .",
    "+ ( 3 ) evolution one by one eliminates species @xmath9 with some @xmath56 , till the reduced dimensional system no longer has any @xmath56 .",
    "+ ( 4 ) the elimination of species takes place in finite time , which depends on initial populations and @xmath10 , but is roughly @xmath57 .",
    "this is in contrast to exponentially decaying tails of transient parts in an altruistic evolution .",
    "+ ( 5 ) the surviving population is given not by the stationary eigenvector of the original system , but by the stationary eigenvector of the reduced dimensional system .",
    "the simple model presented above provides a quantification of features anticipated in darwinian evolution .",
    "the crucial ingredient has been the limited availability of a resource leading to destructive interference .",
    "chance mutation may introduce a species that snatches away the resource from another one .",
    "this always produces an instability , which eliminates the weaker species in a finite time .",
    "the stronger survivors are stable until the next mutation instability .",
    "it is worthwhile to observe that the elementary components of biological systems are so simple and cheap that they can be produced in large numbers even with limited resources . as a result ,",
    "biological systems often exhibit wastefulness , e.g. millions of eggs and pollen grains are produced when a few would have sufficed to propagate the species in a secure environment .",
    "such an overkill actually strengthens the competition and enforces survival of the fittest .    to summarise ,",
    "the analysis presented in this article is straightforward , and points out certain similarities between competitive evolution , zero - sum games and quantum computation .",
    "the latter two possess a sound mathematical framework , and so even a simple analogy with them can help us understand better the behaviour of highly complex biological systems .",
    "the analogies are not perfect , however , and the effect of the differences has to be incorporated properly in the results .",
    "my conclusion is that limited availability of resources leads to competition , which eliminates the weaker species in a finite time .",
    "the arguments presented here can also be applied to other competitive situations , e.g. economic and social interactions ."
