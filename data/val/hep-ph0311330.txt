    "grand unified theories@xcite provide an attractive framework for understanding the origin of the diverse strengths of the various forces observed in nature .",
    "the basic idea is to have a single force associated with a grand unified local symmetry at a high scale , which below the scale of the symmetry breaking evolves into three different strengths corresponding to the observed weak , electromagnetic and strong interactions .",
    "the challenge is to have a theory where the three couplings evolved down to the z - boson mass scale match their experimentally observed values .",
    "a concrete realization of this hypothesis is provided within the framework of supersymmetric models where the unification scale is @xmath4 gev , provided one assumes that there are no intermediate scales below @xmath5 and the scale of supersymmetry breaking is at the weak scale@xcite .",
    "one may then assume that above the scale @xmath5 , the grand unified symmetry takes over . while this observation suggests that the idea grand unification may be correct",
    ", one can not take it as an evidence for it due to the extra assumption of grand desert which is crucial to obtaining unification of couplings .",
    "typical grand unified theories not only unify forces but also quarks and leptons and thereby provide a hope to resolve some of the puzzles of the standard model . especially after the discovery of neutrino masses and mixings , there are a large number of observables in the matter sector that are known fairly precisely and one may expect that a grand unified theory can provide an explanation of these observables .",
    "the obvious question then is : how can one test the idea of grand unification and more precisely , the existence of a local grand unifying symmetry of all matter and forces ? it is well known that one of the consequences of most grand unified theories is that proton is unstable and therefore one may argue that the true test of the grand unification hypothesis will come from the observation of proton decay .",
    "this has led to many experimental as well as theoretical investigations of proton decay in the context of simple grand unified models such as su(5 ) and so(10 ) .",
    "although no evidence for proton decay has been found to date , the stringent experimental upper limits on the partial lifetimes to various modes have provided new and useful constraints on the nature of grand unified theories .",
    "the simplest grand unified theory is the minimal susy su(5 ) model . in this model ,",
    "the dominant decay of proton occurs via dimension five operators involving color triplet higgsino exchange leading to the dominant decay mode @xcite @xmath6 .",
    "the predictions of the minimal renormalizable su(5 ) model for this mode has been discussed in many papers@xcite .",
    "the present experimental lower limit on this mode@xcite is @xmath7 yrs , which is an order of magnitude larger than prediction of the minimal renormalizable susy su(5 ) model .",
    "therefore this model is ruled out .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that if one includes nonrenormalizable terms in the superpotential@xcite , one can get somewhat higher lifetimes for this decay mode and the su(5 ) model can still be consistent with experiments",
    ".    with the discovery of neutrino masses and mixings@xcite , so(10 ) is a much more interesting candidate for grand unification .",
    "it incorporates the right handed neutrino needed for implementing the seesaw mechanism@xcite for understanding small neutrino masses .",
    "in addition , unlike su(5 ) , it incorporates all the fermions of the standard model as well as the right handed neutrino into one spinor representation .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting that using the value of the neutrino mass difference required to understand atmospheric neutrino data and the seesaw formula , one can conclude that at least one of the right handed neutrino masses must be close to @xmath8 gev .",
    "the proximity of this scale to @xmath5 suggests that they may indeed be one and the same .",
    "this would imply that seesaw mechanism may be the first signal of the idea of grand unification .",
    "it would then be urgent to look for other signals for so(10 ) grand unification such as proton decay@xcite .",
    "it has recently been pointed out that there is a class of minimal so(10 ) models , where all neutrino masses and mixings can be predicted without assuming any additional symmetries@xcite .",
    "the basic puzzle of neutrino physics i.e. the two large mixings @xmath9 are explained in this model in a very interesting manner .",
    "all the yukawa couplings that are responsible for proton decay are completely fixed in this model .",
    "our goal in this paper is to study the proton decay in this model .",
    "the key ingredient of our model is the way b - l local symmetry in so(10 ) is broken .",
    "how b - l is broken decides whether the effective mssm theory that emerges below the gut scale conserves r - parity symmetry ( defined by @xmath10 ) or not . as is well - known",
    ", r - parity symmetry is needed to guarantee the existence of a stable dark matter .",
    "the b - l symmetry could either be broken by the * 16 * higgs or by the * 126 * higgs multiplet .",
    "we are driven to using the * 126 * -higgs since , unlike breaking by * 16 * , * 126 * breaks b - l by two units and leaves r - parity unbroken as can be concluded from the formula for r - parity given above and hence a stable dark matter@xcite .",
    "the main observation in the papers@xcite is that if b - l symmetry is broken by a * 126 * dimensional representation of so(10 ) , the coupling of * 126 * to fermions unifies the flavor structure of the quarks and charged leptons with those of the neutrinos .",
    "this makes the model remarkably predictive in the neutrino sector and the predictions obtained in @xcite are now in full accord with all known data for neutrino mixings .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting that the experimentally much sought after parameter @xmath11 is predicted in the model to lie between 0.15 - 0.18 , which can be probed in very near future in the minos experiment at fermilab as well as several future experiments being proposed providing a test of the model .",
    "in order to study proton decay in this model , we consider all dimension five operators@xcite .",
    "there are llll as well as rrrr type operators in this theory .",
    "we find that llll type operators dominate proton decay .",
    "this part of the discussion is similar to that of the su(5 ) model . however , unlike the minimal su(5 ) , in the minimal so(10 ) model there are several contributions which for some domain of parameters can partially cancel each other .",
    "the cancellation is however not complete so that the net effect is to suppress the decay rate .",
    "we are then able to find upper limits on the proton lifetime .",
    "the lifetimes to various p - decay modes with charged lepton final states can be predicted as a function of the color triplet higgsino mass and susy breaking parameters such as the wino mass and squark masses . for a specific choice of these parameters in the supersymmetry breaking sector",
    "( i.e. average @xmath12 tev and @xmath13 ) , we find upper bounds for the partial lifetimes for the modes @xmath14 yrs and @xmath2 yrs we also give the partial lifetimes for other charged lepton modes for these cases .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec.2 , we review the basic outline of the model . in sec 3",
    ", we discuss the effective operators for the various proton decay modes , their origin and dependence on the parameters of the theory . in the first part of sec.4",
    ", we present our predictions for the upper limits as well as the allowed ranges for the partial lifetimes to various modes . in sec . 5 , we present our conclusions .",
    "the so(10 ) model that we will work with in this paper has the following features : it contains three spinor * 16 * -dim .",
    "superfields that contain the matter fields ( denoted by @xmath15 ) ; two higgs fields , one in the * 126 * -dim representation ( denoted by @xmath16 ) that breaks the @xmath17 symmetry down to @xmath18 and another in the * 10 * -dim representation ( @xmath19 ) that breaks the @xmath20 down to @xmath21 .",
    "these are the only two higgs multiplets that couple to fermions and after symmetry breaking give rise to all the fermion masses including the neutrinos .",
    "the original so(10 ) symmetry can be broken down to the left - right group @xmath22 by @xmath23 higgs fields denoted by @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "we wish to point out that the minimal realistic so(10 ) model of the type under discussion can be constructed without including a * 54 * higgs field@xcite",
    ". however we include it here since it provides the most general description of proton decay .    to see what this model implies for fermion masses , let us explain how the mssm doublets emerge and the consequent fermion mass sumrules they lead to .",
    "as noted , the * 10 * and @xmath26 contain two ( 2,2,1 ) and ( 2,2,15 ) submultiplets ( under @xmath27 subgroup of so(10 ) ) .",
    "we denote the two pairs by @xmath28 and @xmath29(2,2,@xmath30 ) multiplets also mixes with the afore mentioned doublets . but",
    "this simply redefines the mixing angles @xmath31 and does not affect any of our results ] . at the gut scale , by some doublet - triplet splitting mechanism these two pairs reduce to the mssm higgs pair @xmath32 , which can be expressed in terms of the @xmath33 and @xmath16 as follows :",
    "@xmath34 the details of the doublet - triplet splitting mechanism that leads to the above equation are not relevant for what follows and we do not discuss it here .",
    "as in the case of mssm , we will assume that the higgs doublets @xmath35 have the vevs @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    in orders to discuss fermion masses in this model ,",
    "we start with the so(10 ) invariant superpotential giving the yukawa couplings of the * 16 * dimensional matter spinor @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 denote generations ) with the higgs fields @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 so(10 ) invariance implies that @xmath43 and @xmath44 are symmetric matrices .",
    "we ignore the effects coming from the higher dimensional operators , as we mentioned earlier .",
    "also we set all cp phases in the superpotential as well as vevs to zero , so that the observed kaon and b - cp violation is a consequence of all cp phases residing in the squark sector .",
    "below the b - l breaking ( seesaw ) scale , we can write the superpotential terms for the charged fermion yukawa couplings as : @xmath45 where @xmath46 in general @xmath47 and this difference is responsible for nonzero ckm mixing angles . in terms of the gut scale yukawa couplings , one can write the fermion mass matrices ( defined as @xmath48 ) at the seesaw scale as : @xmath49 where @xmath50 the mass sumrules in eq .",
    "( [ sumrule ] ) were crucial to the predictivity of the model .",
    "the neutrino masses are then predicted using the type ii seesaw formula@xcite : @xmath51 in models which have asymptotic parity symmetry such as left - right or so(10 ) models , it is the type ii seesaw that is more generic than the conventional seesaw formula . for some parameter range ,",
    "the first term may dominate .",
    "what is important for our considerations is that the matrix @xmath44 that determines the flavor structure of the neutrinos is related to the quark and lepton masses .    using eq.[sumrule ] and [ type2 ] , in reference @xcite",
    "the neutrino masses and mixings have been calculated .",
    "we do not display those predictions here .",
    "but we note that by scanning over the allowed values for the extrapolated quark and lepton masses as well as quark mixings , we find a range of predictions for the neutrino sector .",
    "we find that a large range of the predictions are disfavored by the latest solar data@xcite . however , there is also a significant allowed region . for this region ,",
    "we extract all the yukawa parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 corresponding to this range and use them in our calculation of proton decay rate below .",
    "a typical set of values for @xmath43 s and @xmath44 s in this range are : @xmath54 and @xmath55",
    "in our model , there are four supersymmetric graphs that contribute to @xmath56 operator .",
    "they are given in fig . 1 and involve the exchange of * 10 *",

    "for the same analysis , the operator @xmath95 gives @xmath96 and so it only contributes to @xmath97 decay mode .      in view of the discussion",
    "just given the dominant contribution to proton decay arises from charged wino exchange converting the two sfermions to fermions .",

    "we check the above results adopting an alternative strategy where we express the three parameters @xmath106 in terms of three partial life times and plot the other lifetimes as a function of these partial life times .",
    "it turns out that if we pick a certain value for the partial life time of the @xmath107 mode and use it as an input , the other two input values get very restricted .",
    "this allows us to use only the @xmath108 mode as a variable and give the others as a prediction . in fig . 5 and 6 we present the allowed values for various partial lifetimes as a function of the partial lifetime for the mode @xmath109 .",
    "there is a slight spread around the various lines .",
    "we first find that the lifetime for the mode @xmath110 can be arbitrarily large as can be seen from fig .",
    "5 . also , from fig . 5",
    ", we see that modes @xmath111 and @xmath112 have upper bounds which are same as the ones derived previously .",
    "in summary , we have discussed the predictions for nucleon decay in the minimal so(10 ) model which has recently been shown to lead to predictions for neutrino masses and mixings in agreement with observations using only the assumption of type ii seesaw mechanism .",
    "the key feature of this model is that b - l symmetry is broken by a single * 126 * field that also contributes to fermion masses . for the range of the parameters that are allowed by the neutrino data , we vary the gut scale parameters ( unrelated to the neutrino sector ) so as to satisfy the stringent experimental bounds for the decay mode @xmath113 .",
