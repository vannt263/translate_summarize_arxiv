    "along the last decades several heuristic proposals have provided model - independent features and insights for a better understanding of the nature behaviour at shortest distances , i.e. of a quantum theory of gravity , these are highly motivated with phenomenological inspirations @xcite .",
    "the search for a common description of particle physics and gravity and for a quantum theory of the gravitational sector is certainly one of the most outstanding and longstanding problems in physics .",
    "space - time noncommutativity and non - heisenberg uncertainty relations naturally emerges at plank scale in attempts to accommodate quantum mechanics and general relativity in a common framework @xcite ; it is generally believed that our smooth classical picture of spacetime should break down at small distances since quantum fluctuations start to dominate .",
    "one common feature of such frameworks is the existence of a minimal measure length that is ascribed to quantum gravitational effects , or even that the continuum representation of spacetime breaks near to planck scale @xmath1 , suggesting in this case that planck s length @xmath2 acts as a minimal measurable length scale @xcite in almost all frameworks of quantum gravity ( string theory , black hole physics , loop quantum gravity , etc ) @xcite .    in this way , in order to incorporate the presence of a minimal measurable length scale in a given theory , its canonical structure is changed and hence heisenberg uncertainty principle is modified , which is then generalized to a new uncertainty principle , the so - called generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) that encompass this minimal length scale @xcite @xmath3 another consequence in order to encompass the presence of a minimal length is that the canonical heisenberg algebra , @xmath4=i \\hbar$ ] , is modified to a non canonical form  in agreement to the generalized uncertainty principle .",
    "thus , in this context , the commutation relation of the position and momentum operators is now momentum and/or position operator dependent and can be represented generally by the expression @xmath4=i",
    "\\hbar f(\\hat{x},\\hat{p})$ ] , where @xmath5 is some function of the operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 ; so that all the gup can be obtained from a given function @xmath5 .",
    "notice that the ordinary case is recovered when this function goes to unit .    in the sense of a gup , a simple deformation of the heisenberg algebra given as @xcite @xmath8=i\\hbar\\left(\\delta_{j}^{i}+\\tilde{\\alpha}\\left(\\hat{p}^{2}\\delta_{j}^{i}+2\\hat{p}^{i}\\hat{p}_{j}\\right)\\right),\\label{eq:0.1}\\ ] ]",
    "is found to be consistent with the existence of a minimum length , with @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is a constant assumed to be of order of unit .",
    "on the other hand , in a generalization of special relativity , there are approaches that suggest the existence of an independent observer scale which could be a planck energy scale , this is the so - called doubly special relativity ( dsr ) @xcite .",
    "it should be remarked that the interesting thing about dsr is that it preserves lorentz symmetry and the basic postulates of special relativity , but in addition it introduces an upper limit of energy .",
    "it is also possible to express the dsr feature of a maximum momentum scale in the form of a deformed algebra @xcite @xmath8=i\\hbar\\left(\\delta_{j}^{i}-\\tilde{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\sqrt{\\hat{p}^{2}}\\delta_{j}^{i}+\\frac{\\hat{p}^{i}\\hat{p}_{j}}{\\sqrt{\\hat{p}^{2}}}\\right)\\right),\\label{eq:0.2}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 .",
    "one can , however , define a new algebra encompassing both features of gup and dsr , minimal length and maximum momentum , respectively , so that the commutators read @xcite @xmath8=i\\hbar\\left(\\delta_{j}^{i}-\\varepsilon\\left(\\sqrt{\\hat{p}^{2}}\\delta_{j}^{i}+\\frac{\\hat{p}^{i}\\hat{p}_{j}}{\\sqrt{\\hat{p}^{2}}}\\right)+\\alpha\\left(\\hat{p}^{2}\\delta_{j}^{i}+2\\hat{p}^{i}\\hat{p}_{j}\\right)\\right),\\label{eq:0.3}\\ ] ] in this case the relations @xmath12=0=\\left[\\hat{p}^{i},\\hat{p}_{j}\\right]$ ] are ensured via jacobi identity .",
    "for instance , the one - dimensional gup is found to be @xmath13 in particular , we see that the choice @xmath14 reproduces the results of the gup as proposed by ref .  @xcite . as a result",
    ", we find out from this expression that @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "additionally , we see that the physical momentum is modified as follows @xmath17 where the tilde operators satisfy the usual canonical heisenberg algebra . in view of these effects , one observes a modification into the energy - momentum dispersion relation so that @xmath18 .",
    "such modifications definitely have prominent effects in a plethora of quantum physical phenomena @xcite .",
    "one particular and rich context where gup implies essential effects is into statistical and thermodynamic properties of any physical system @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that gup changes the number of accessible microscopic states of the phase space volume , which thus modify the density states .",
    "although studies have been presented investigating thermal effects on physical systems , ideal gas or photon gas , in the presence of different types of gup , we wish here to analyse photon gas thermodynamics from a field theoretical point - of - view . hence , for this purpose we will consider a covariant extension of the algebra proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and employ it in the analysis of thermal effects on a photon gas .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we briefly review the main aspects of the covariant deformed heisenberg algebra , and deduce a generalized field strength tensor associated to this deformed algebra .",
    "moreover , we propose a functional action for the gauge field based on this generalized field strength tensor , and determine the respective feynman rules which takes into account leading gup effects . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we compute the one - loop diagrams contribution to the effective lagrangian . next , in sec",
    ".  [ sec4 ] , we proceed and calculate the two - loop graphs contribution at high - temperature limit to the effective lagrangian . thus , based on the one- and two - loop results we compute the internal energy density .",
    "finally , our conclusions and remarks are given in sec .",
    "it is of our interest to consider a gup formulated so that the time component is included @xcite  an extension of the algebra .",
    "thus , we have @xmath19=i\\left(\\delta_{\\nu}^{\\mu}-\\varepsilon\\left(\\sqrt{\\hat{p}^{2}}\\delta_{\\nu}^{\\mu}+\\frac{\\hat{p}^{\\mu}\\hat{p}_{\\nu}}{\\sqrt{\\hat{p}^{2}}}\\right)+\\alpha\\left(\\hat{p}^{2}\\delta_{\\nu}^{\\mu}+2\\hat{p}^{\\mu}\\hat{p}_{\\nu}\\right)\\right).\\label{eq:1.1}\\ ] ] moreover , we can define a new set of phase - space variables @xmath20 so that they satisfy the canonical commutation relations @xmath21=i$ ] , it can be shown that is satisfied . in particular ,",
    "@xmath22 can be interpreted as the momentum at low energies ( where the representation in position space reads @xmath23 ) while @xmath24 is that at higher energies .",
    "although this generalized gup has both minimal length and maximal momentum ( time and energy ) the @xmath25-dependent term gives non - local contributions which complicate substantially our analysis in regard to the gauge fields ( for instance , when taking the minimal coupling in configuration representation @xmath26 , we obtain @xmath27 ) .",
    "hence , we shall take @xmath28 and concentrate our analysis only on the @xmath29-dependent terms  that will engender minimal length and time effects .    perhaps an alternative way to workaround the problematic non - local behavior due to",
    "the use of minimal coupling in the above realization of position and momentum operators , i.e. those @xmath30 @xmath25-dependent terms , is to find a generalized procedure of minimal coupling such as in ref .",
    "@xcite . there",
    "the authors find lorentz force and maxwell s equations on kappa - minkowski space - time by postulating that the momentum ( with gauge field ) @xmath31 satisfies the same commutation relation as @xmath32 .",
    "hence , this generalized approach could help us to circumvent the above non - local issues , or at least give us insights , since it is expected that this approach give us different realization for the operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 in , so that terms like @xmath30 are fully removed , but at the same preserving the gup structure .",
    "nonetheless , this proposal should be further elaborated and in a positive case analyzed for a development of a deformed electrodynamics .",
    "based on the above discussion , one can immediately conclude that a gup , actually the variables from , leads to an action of infinite order in derivatives , implying thus in an infinite series of interaction terms .",
    "this is the most interesting point that we wish to explore . in particular",
    ", one can easily see that a calculation to the first order already yields additional interactions terms of the gauge field .",
    "we shall now apply gup , i.e. , to the free dirac action and then resort to the ( minimal coupling ) gauge principle in order to develop the formalism for the gauge fields . in this deformed scenario ,",
    "the action reads @xcite @xmath35\\psi,\\ ] ] it is easy to see that this action is invariant under a certain global symmetry transformation .",
    "now , if we extend this to a local transformation , the additional derivatives also act on the local unitary operator @xmath36 , so we must have the replacement @xcite @xmath37 hence , from this minimal coupling , in the same way the usual covariant derivative satisfies @xmath38 one can show that the transformation of the subsequent term reads @xmath39 note that @xmath40=0 $ ] , since here @xmath36 does not refers to a spacetime transformation , otherwise we should have @xmath41 . according to the above transformation rules",
    ", it shows to be convenient to define a gup covariant derivative @xmath42 in particular , we see that it behaves as the usual covariant derivative under a local gauge transformation , i.e. @xmath43 .",
    "consequently , a generalized definition of the field strength tensor for the gauge fields follows naturally .",
    "this is achieved by the definition @xmath44\\phi.\\label{eq:1.5}\\ ] ] in particular , this relation is well motivated and necessary so that the field equations following from the action for the gauge field ( built from such definition ) contain gup effects .",
    "furthermore , notice that from this definition the gauge invariance of the field strength tensor follows as @xmath45 .",
    "we can now compute an explicit expression for the generalized field strength tensor up to @xmath29-order , so that it yields @xmath46 here we have introduced the usual abelian field strength @xmath47 .",
    "thus we have that the maxwell s invariant reads @xcite @xmath48 the gauge invariance of the generalized maxwell s invariant follows from the gauge invariance of the field strength tensor @xmath49 . moreover , notice that the first two terms are those present in the bopp - podolsky generalized electrodynamics @xcite . these are higher - derivative ( hd ) terms and",
    "they have several problems associated with their presence , for instance unitarity @xcite .",
    "however , they have prominent role in gravity @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , we shall use the action defined by in our analysis of thermal effects .",
    "on the other hand , we can also consider a second invariant @xmath50 which is also gauge invariant , where we have introduced a dual for the field strength tensor @xmath49 defined as field strength tensor @xmath51 .",
    "that can be used for instance in the analysis of gup effects on nonlinear electrodynamics , for instance in the born - infeld electrodynamics .    in order to proceed with our analysis",
    "let us consider the following functional action @xmath52 the next step is to derive the feynman rules from .",

    "these two contributions can be in principle compared at the light - by - light scattering , since all three these vertex have a finite contribution .",
