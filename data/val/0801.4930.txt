    "an important remark is due .",
    "frequently one faces the case of dynamics ruled by spin - preserving hamiltonian models ( _ i.e. _ hamiltonians that commute with the total spin operator of the system ) . by assuming appropriate boundary conditions",

    ", @xmath12 does not preserve the total number of excited spins , so that the mutual coupling among subspaces labeled by different numbers of spin - excitation has to be considered . rather than applying techniques for the exact solution of eq .",
    "( [ modellozz ] )  @xcite , we propose to tackle the evolution of the system by means of an _ information - flux approach _ ( ifa ) which is specifically designed for multi - spin interactions  @xcite . our method does not rely on the explicit analysis of the chain s spectrum and enables us to gather an intuitive picture of the dynamics at hand .    on a formal level ,",
    "the ifa requires the time - evolved form of specific operators @xmath13 in the heisenberg picture , _ i.e. _ @xmath14 ( here @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) .",
    "this allows one to understand the dependence of @xmath13 on any @xmath17 and to design the set of coupling strengths @xmath18 in such a way that it becomes possible to _ drive _ a desired evolution by means of engineered quantum interference  @xcite .",
    "our task here is the transmission of quantum information from the first qubit to the last one in the chain .",
    "this requires the study of @xmath19 s , which can be decomposed into the operator - basis built out of all possible tensorial products of @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , we can write @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the initial state of the whole chain , @xmath23 is the initial state of the first qubit only and @xmath24 is the state of the rest of the chain .",

    "we discuss here a simple but yet helpful application of the method .",
    "we consider a three - qubit open chain whose hamiltonian reads @xmath32 . by solving the corresponding schrdinger equation",
    ", it is well known that perfect state transfer from the first to the third qubit is achieved in this case when the initial state of second and third qubit is @xmath33 and waiting a time @xmath34  @xcite . by analyzing the evolution of the operator @xmath35 , we find @xmath36 .",
    "similar results are obtained by looking at the evolution of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",

    "we have thus obtained a unit information flux ( _ i.e. _ perfect state transfer ) at the time predicted by the standard approach .",
    "our simple example shows the basic features of ifa _ at work_.",
    "in order to properly understand our scheme for perfect state transfer , it is useful to consider the hamiltonian @xmath43 by analyzing the evolution of @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( in the heisenberg picture ) under the action of @xmath46 , we obtain that @xmath47 and @xmath48 can be written as @xmath49 the time - dependent coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath51 are functions of @xmath4 and @xmath52 .",

    "( [ modelloxx ] ) ( the single - qubit operation being required in order to rotate the operator - basis of the first qubit and obtain unit flux between homonymous operators ) , perfect state transfer can be obtained . under this point of view , our approach is quite non - conventional .",
    "in fact , instead of using a formal map between models ( [ modelloxx ] ) and ( [ hcambridge ] ) , we gather our analytic results and design the optimal protocol in virtue of a quantitative analogy between the evolution of specific sets of operators as driven by the two interaction hamiltonians we consider .",
    "we remark that this is possible solely because of the power of ifa .",
    "hamiltonian  ( [ modelloxx ] ) can be easily mapped onto the one in eq .",
    "( [ modellozz ] ) and perfect state transfer thus achieved with a further change of basis for all the qubits in the chain that transforms @xmath70 .",
    "let us go into the details of the protocol .",
    "we prepare the first qubit in the state @xmath71 and apply the following recipe for perfect state - transfer :    * : the operator @xmath72 is applied to the first qubit of the chain , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 is a hadamard gate  @xcite . * : the chain evolves under the action of @xmath12 for a time @xmath66 .    in this way",
    ", the state of the last qubit will be @xmath75 , while the rest of the chain in the tensorial product state @xmath76 , thus achieving perfect state transfer .",
    "the first step is required to cope with both the necessary basis changes ( the first one to map the hamiltonian @xmath77 onto @xmath69 and the second one to obtain unit fluxes between homonymous operators ) and can be performed off - line .",
    "this corresponds to carrying out only the second step but using the initial state @xmath78/{\\sqrt{2}}$ ] .",
    "alternatively , the change of basis can also be performed off - line at the end of the evolution driven by @xmath12 .",
    "the initialization of the register in the tensorial product of @xmath79 states can be obtained by cooling a thermal state of the qubit system to their own @xmath80 state ( thus achieving @xmath81 , which is the standard initial state in quantum state - transfer protocols  @xcite ) and then applying single - qubit hadamard gates .",
    "the same task can also be achieved by using a collective external potential resonant with the transition between the single - qubit levels , waiting enough time for the system to relax to the ground state and then applying the hadamard gates .",
    "interesting features arise from a deeper analysis of the model encompassed by @xmath12 .",
    "indeed , the same parameter pattern addressed up until now can be used so as to generate an n - qubit ghz state @xmath82 .",
    "if the initial state of every qubit is set to be @xmath65 , after the action of @xmath12 for a time @xmath66 , the system will be in state @xmath83 .",
    "this is understood by considering the fact that the evolution @xmath84 can be decomposed into the equivalent quantum circuit shown in fig .",
    "[ equiv ]  @xcite .",
    "it is then straightforward to check that a ghz state of the above mentioned form is the result of the computation described there .",
    "it is very important to stress that our scheme to generate entanglement does not require any pre - built entanglement resource .",
    "multipartite entanglement is generated in the chain only as a result of spin - non - preserving dynamics .",
    "an analogous situation has recently been addressed in  @xcite .",
    "we address the effects of static disorder in the pattern of coupling strengths which is required for the optimal performance of the protocols .",
    "this is useful in a general situation , and particularly necessary in the case of superconducting qubits .",
    "although control over lithographic techniques being used in the fabrication of superconducting qubits is constantly being improved , it is reasonable to expect that the elements of a long chain of effective spins would not be identical and the inter - qubit couplings will correspondingly be affected .",
    "we also consider the influences of markovian dissipation and phase - decoherence on the state transfer and the creation of a multipartite ghz state . in order to account for the usual finite spatial environmental correlation length that frequently affects solid - state systems ,",
    "we address both the case of uncorrelated individual baths being coupled to the spins in a chain as well as the case of the same bosonic environment affecting multiple spins simultaneously .",
    "our study reveals not only a considerable resilience of the protocols at hand but also points out some interesting features that highlight the counter - intuitive nature of noise effects in purely quantum dynamics .",
    "it is worth stressing that , as we study a coupling model with a novel pattern of interaction strengths , which is different from the one given in  @xcite , an investigation about noise effects is quite significant and represents a due step in the full characterization of the scheme we study .",
    "such a program is in line with previous studies on fluctuation and noise in state transfer protocols , which can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we start by analyzing the effects of static disorder in the coupling - strength pattern for the state transfer protocol .",
    "our model for such imperfections is that of a distribution of coupling strengths along the chain according to  @xcite @xmath85,\\\\ b_i\\rightarrow{\\cal b}_i&={b}_i[1+\\delta(1 - 2{s}_i ) ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath86 the ` strength ' of the disorder ( typically a few percent of @xmath87 ) and @xmath88 $ ] that decide whether the imperfect parameter is larger or smaller than the ideal value . in our study",
    ", we take @xmath89 s and @xmath90 s as random numbers following a given probability distribution .",
    "clearly , the choice of such a distribution should be made consistent with a given experimental situation . here",
    ", in order to gather a simple idea of what the effect of static disorder is , a uniform distribution is chosen .",
    "intuitively , this case should depict a sort of ` worst case ' scenario for the influences of disorder .",
    "we show that , for values of @xmath86 which are within the current accuracy of lithographic fabrication of superconducting qubits , this class of imperfections does not significantly affect the performance of quantum state transfer in our chain .",
    "the figure of merit that we choose in order to test the performance of the protocol affected by disorder is the state fidelity between the logical input qubit and the state of the @xmath91 physical qubit of the chain at time @xmath92 . indeed , while it is reasonable to expect that disorder would influence the state of the rest of the chain , leaving it in a state different from the expected @xmath93 , this is irrelevant in a state - transfer problem .",
    "clearly , in a real physical situation , we have no available information on the exact value of the disordered coupling strengths pattern .",
    "this implies that a faithful measure of the quality of our protocol would be rather given by the average of state fidelity over a large sample of disorder configurations ( from now on called _ runs _ ) .",
    "that is , if we indicate as @xmath94 the state fidelity corresponding to a given run labelled by the integer @xmath95 ( with @xmath96 is the ideal state to transfer and @xmath97 the reduced density matrix of the last qubit of the chain ) , we will consider the average value @xmath98 the cut - off @xmath99 in the estimation of the average is taken large enough to guarantee that no appreciable differences in @xmath100 are observed if a larger @xmath99 is taken .",
    "we first consider a state - dependent situation based on an analogy with existing studies on quantum state transfer .",
    "we will shortly demonstrate that the state fidelity of the process is very weakly dependent on the input state being considered .",
    "however , in order to fix the ideas , we consider the arbitrarily chosen input state @xmath101 . as a trade off between required computational power and length of the chain , we have examined the case of @xmath102 qubits throughout the paper ( where not stated differently ) .",
    "although the results presented in our study depend on the length of the chain system being studied , we have checked that such a dependence is very weak and our findings can be taken as faithful indications of the behavior of even longer chains . as the maximum of fidelity is expected for @xmath66 , we restrict our observation to a temporal window centered in this value . in fig .",
    "[ disordine ] , we compare the ideal and the disordered situation for a strength @xmath103 , which is a typical in state of the art value  @xcite .    * ( a)*3.85cm*(b ) *    0.3 cm    evidently , the influence of disorder is negligible , at least for the operating conditions considered above : not only is the height of the fidelity peak preserved almost perfectly , but also such peak occurs precisely at the re - scaled time that is expected under ideal performances .",
    "this is important , experimentally , as it proves that our state of ignorance over the exact value of the disordered coupling strengths does not require the fine adjustment of the time at which the logical qubit to be transferred should be collected .    as a step forward in the analysis of the protocol",
    ", we now remove any dependence on the logical state to be transferred .",
    "we take a ` black box ' perspective under which the problem at hand is not different from that of characterizing an unknown operation ( the transfer channel with disorder ) with respect to an ideal one which would map the logical input state onto the same state at the @xmath91 physical qubit , leaving the logical input state unchanged .",
    "such a characterization is efficiently performed by using quantum process tomography ( qpt ) techniques  @xcite , which has proven to be invaluably useful in many experimental contexts  @xcite .",
    "qpt is a useful tools for the evaluation of the global closeness between the ideal and disordered transfer channel . by studying the way the black box affects the transfer of the four _ probe states _",
    "@xmath104 , we can reconstruct the so - called _ process matrix _ @xmath105 of the disordered process .",
    "this contains all the relevant information regarding the process that a logical qubit undergoes in being transferred from the first to the last physical qubit .",
    "we refer to existing literature  @xcite for further mathematical details and just mention that the qpt approach can also be computationally beneficial as the averaged state fidelity can be calculated out of the process fidelity @xmath106 with @xmath107 the process matrix of the logical identity operation that is applied to the logical qubit to transfer in the perfect case . in the operator basis @xmath108 , this reads @xmath109 qpt allows the reconstruction of the effective kraus operators of the disordered transfer channel and , from these , one can easily get the output density matrix for any logical input state . in turn , by using the correspondence between density matrix and bloch vector , we can visualize the effect of the disorder directly on the bloch sphere of the transferred state , thus getting a general overview of the behavior of the protocol .",
    "given the results in fig .",
    "[ disordine ] , the output bloch sphere with disorder strength @xmath103 at @xmath66 should be very close to the bloch sphere of a pure qubit state .",
    "this is indeed the case , as shown in fig .",
    "[ qpt0qpt5 ] , where panel * ( a ) * shows the bloch sphere for the ideal protocol , while panel * ( b ) * addresses the case of the disordered pattern corresponding to the worst fidelity among @xmath110 runs .",
    "the two processes are evidently quite close to each other , the most evident difference being a slight unwanted rotation of the sphere s poles around the @xmath111 axis .",
    "we have checked that the rotation angle is an increasing function of the disorder s strength .",
    "no shrinking of the sphere for the disordered case is evident , showing that coherence and amplitude of the logical qubit are almost perfectly preserved .",
    "the matrix of the disordered process is given by @xmath112 which corresponds to a state fidelity of @xmath113 .",
    "the state fidelity averaged over the whole set of runs is as large as @xmath114 .",
    "the closeness of this number to the worst - case fidelity shows that the disordered state transfer process depends only very weakly on the pattern of disorder . on the other hand",
    ", the evident isotropy of the reconstructed bloch sphere justifies an arbitrary choice of the input state for our explicit analysis .",
    "we can therefore confidently affirm that , within the range of chain s length we have studied , static disorder does not spoil the process we have designed for perfect state transfer across a chain .",
    "the average fidelity of the process stays largely above @xmath115 , the highest value for a classical transmission of a state  @xcite , up until values of @xmath116 .    *",

    "[ qpt0qpt5 ]    we now consider the effects of dissipation and decoherence on the protocol .",
    "we assume conditions of weak coupling of the spins of the chain with the environment , so that a spin - boson approach can be retained and the consequent non - unitary dynamics can be studied within the context of a lindbladian approach or , equivalently , an operator - sum representation of the evolution  @xcite . by choosing this second perspective , as it will clearly appear in what follows , we model our study along the lines of a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the environmental action over the chain is identified in the effects of both amplitude and phase damping channels .",
    "first , we address the case of @xmath2 individual baths , one for each spin of the chain .",
    "this assumption is physically motivated by considering that each josephson charge qubit has its own voltage gate and can thus suffer _ individual _ electromagnetic fluctuations .",
    "then in order to account for the finite spatial correlation length of a markovian environment , which may occur in solid - state systems , we consider a bosonic environment affecting more than a single spin simultaneously ( as can be the case for a bath of background phonons arising from the common substrate onto which the charge qubits are placed ) . in the following ,",
    "we show a considerable robustness of the state transfer protocol against both these sources of imperfection and the appearance of some counter - intuitive features that can be related to the phenomenon of stochastic resonances  @xcite .    in an operator - sum representation ,",

    "moreover , we randomly determine the set of kraus operator to apply and the specific spin being affected .",
    "the disorder s pattern is kept as fixed for the duration of one of such simulated dynamics . in virtue of the weak dependence of state fidelity on @xmath86 ,",

    "again , the peak of fidelity is obtained at the expected value @xmath66 , although the effects of noise and decoherence , altering the pattern of quantum interference that is at the basis of a state transfer process  @xcite , could also have resulted in a shift of the peak .",
    "a more complete picture comes from the analysis by means of qtp . as before ,",
    "we have chosen a random configuration of disordered coupling strengths and have then evaluated the effects of decoherence and dissipation on a generic input state , obtaining the output bloch sphere in fig .",

    ", we needed to reduce the number of qubits in the chain to @xmath136 and increase the number of runs to obtain a better plot .",
    "moreover , in order to exclude any dependence on the input state , we have averaged the state fidelity over a large sample of random pure input states . in virtue of the almost perfect insensitivity of the protocol to the specific instance of input state , this step turned out to be rather conservative .",
    "the most relevant feature appearing from this study is that , for a fixed value of @xmath126 , the state fidelity has a ( weak ) non - monotonic convex behavior against @xmath125 . as this feature is not well visible from fig .",

    "the non - monotonic transmission fidelity provides us with a new way to characterize the response of a system which differs from the figures of merit used in  @xcite , where dynamical properties ( such as the chain s magnetization ) or information theoretic ones ( such as the mutual information ) have been used as a measure of global correlations .",
    "our study goes along the lines of previous results by mancini and bowen  @xcite , where the rate of transmission of information through a class of quantum channels is shown to increase with the external noise .",
    "the results of our investigation motivate further studies of stochastic resonance phenomena in the context of information transmission through quantum channels .",
    "we conclude our analysis of the effects of realistic imperfections on the proposed protocol for quantum state transfer by addressing the case of baths having a longer correlation length , so as to give rise to non - localized environmental effects .",
    "the analysis so far has been done by considering every qubit interacting with its own independent bath .",
    "as explained before , the substrate where our hypothetical superconducting chain is fabricated could provide a mechanism for correlated noise at longer haul . in this case the qubits can be considered , in first instance , to interact with shared baths . here , in order to provide an intuitive idea of the general behavior of the protocol with respect to this situation , we consider the simplest case in which we have a collection of independent baths , each affecting a pair of spins at the same time . in order to model the evolution of the system in this scenario we use the operator - sum representation corresponding to the set of kraus operators for two - qubit collective phase damping noise ( see ref .",

    ". the results are comparable to the case of individual environment attached to each spin and we have checked that this feature does not depend on the number of qubits being affected at the same time by a given bath  @xcite .      we now pass to a brief analysis of the proposed protocol for ghz - state generation along the lines described in the previous part of our study . however",
    ", here there is an important technical difference that has to be stressed : differently from what has been done above , here we need to consider the global fidelity of chain with a ghz state of the form @xmath82 .",
    "indeed , we are now interested in the generation of a multipartite entangled state where every qubit will be involved .",
    "we have evaluated the evolution of the system in the noisy scenario .",
    "we take advantage of the analysis performed in the previous section and in order to avoid unnecessary redundancy , we present here the results obtained including static disorder , dissipation and phase decoherence , without considering them individually .    *",

    "[ ghz ] shows the fidelity against dimensionless time @xmath140 in the ideal case [ panel * ( a ) * ] and for the same values of disorder , decoherence and dissipation rates and temperature used previously [ panel * ( b ) * ] .",
    "the chain we have considered is seven - qubit long and the state fidelity has been averaged over 200 different runs .",
    "although the performance of the protocol seems to be inferior to the one corresponding to quantum state transfer , we should keep in mind that here we are using a global figure of merit . moreover , despite the fragility of ghz - like entanglement to various forms of noisy channels  @xcite , the resilience of the imperfect multipartite - entanglement generation protocol is still quite satisfactory ( maximum fidelity larger than @xmath141 ) .",
    "we have used information flux methods in order to design a protocol for quantum state transfer in a finite , open chain of qubits .",
    "the protocol is based on a nontrivial map between the algebra of angular momenta an a control - limited ising - like hamiltonian with additional local magnetic fields .",
    "the dynamics described by such a coupling is rich enough to provide an effective way of performing a multipartite entangling gate among the elements of the register , which produces ghz - like entanglement .",
    "both these protocols have been analyzed in terms of their resilience against certain realistic sources of disorder and decoherence and were found to be rather robust .",
    "moreover , our study has uncovered an unexpected relation between state - transfer fidelity and quantum stochastic resonances , thus giving our pragmatically - oriented work a more fundamental character .",
    "our investigation contributes to the affirmation of information flux - based methods in the design of multipartite systems in control - limited scenarios and to the ubiquitous nature of stochastic resonance mechanisms , two points which certainly deserve further studies .",
