    "central compact objects ( ccos ) constitute a group of x - ray - emitting , radio - quiet neutron stars found near the centers of supernova remnants ( snrs ) . to date , x - ray pulsations have been firmly detected from only three ccos .",

    "see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for observations and overview of related theory",
    ". due to the limited sample of ccos that exhibit x - ray pulsations , the physical mechanism responsible for their x - ray emission is not well understood , and their active lifetime and long - term evolution are poorly constrained .",
    "it remains unclear if ccos are active radio pulsars beamed away from us or if the radio emission mechanism is intrinsically inoperative . since ccos are associated with very young snrs , their nature and evolution are highly relevant to the neutron star production rate and the physics underlying the diversity of neutron stars produced by core collapse .    the compact x - ray source cxou j185238.6 + 004020 was discovered in the center of the snr kesteven 79 by @xcite .",
    "subsequently , @xcite discovered 105 ms pulsations from this cco , now named psr j1852 + 0040 , establishing it as a young neutron star .",
    "a dedicated long - term x - ray timing campaign of psr j1852 + 0040 facilitated the first definite measurement of the spin - down rate of a cco pulsar by @xcite .",

    "an order of magnitude higher than its spin - down power @xmath13 erg s@xmath10 , the x - ray radiation from psr j1852 + 0040 is clearly not powered by the rotational kinetic energy of the star , thus requiring an additional energy source , such as residual cooling or low - level accretion .",
    "the thermal x - ray emission from psr j1852 + 0040 is characterized by a single unusually broad pulse , with a very high pulsed fraction of @xmath14 .",

    "although based on the spin - down measurement the implied surface field at the magnetic equator of psr j1852 + 0040 is @xmath49 g , the strong x - ray pulsations may be a manifestation of a substantially stronger field at the location of the hot regions , although the value can not be easily determined as there are no obvious absorption features ( see  5.1 ) .",

    "as a consequence , any inferences drawn from modeling the thermal emission are likely to be dependent on the true surface magnetic field strength and its orientation relative to the surface .    for strongly magnetized atmospheres ( @xmath0@xmath1 g ) , a narrow `` pencil '' beam along the direction of the magnetic field can also appear in instances when the observer s line of sight crosses the magnetic field lines , as well as a broad `` fan '' beam with peak intensity at intermediate angles with respect to the surface normal ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "neutron star atmospheres have the general property of producing continuum radiation with peak intensities at higher energies relative to a planck spectrum for the same effective temperature @xcite . as a consequence ,",

    "however , in the case of psr j1852 + 0040 in particular , the area of the warm emission region required to produce a satisfactory fit exceeds the total surface area of a @xmath99 km and @xmath100 km neutron star , for the cosine and pencil plus fan beam patterns , respectively .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the most probable geometric configurations of the emission regions deduced from the pulse profile modeling for a neutron star with radius of 12 km .",
    "similar configurations are obtained for the range of plausible neutron star radii considered in the analysis .",
    "figures 4 and 5 show summary plots of the various parameters of the fit based on the array of monte carlo simulations .",
    "several noteworthy features of the inferred emission regions are evident .",
    "in particular , for the isotropic and cosine beaming patterns , the results favor emission regions that have substantial elongation in the longitudinal direction , with aspect ratios ranging from 3:1 for the warm emission region to nearly 100:1 for the hot component . the requirement for such extreme aspect ratios to reproduce the data explains why the conventional polar cap model can not fit the pulse profile using these emission patterns . even in the case of two polar caps that are adjacent and aligned in the @xmath48 direction ,",
    "it is only possible to obtain an aspect ratio up to @xmath22:1 .",
    "as evident from figure 3 , for the elongated strip geometry the hot emission region tends to lie well away from the spin poles , which is a necessary condition for producing the large pulse amplitude at higher photon energies .",
    "the warm region is substantially more extended in both longitude and latitude , nearly wrapping around the star and covering up to @xmath250% of the entire stellar surface ( see , e.g. , the top two maps in figure 3 ) . in general , the fits favor co - located hot and warm regions , especially a thin hot strip enveloped entirely by a much larger warm region .",
    "this suggest that the thermal x - ray radiation originates from a single contiguous multi - temperature region .",
    "it is possible that the strips are not at constant latitude , but are instead inclined with respect to the spin equator .",
    "however , accounting for this would require the introduction of an additional free parameter , which , given the excellent fit of the current model , is not warranted by the data",
    ". moreover , any such inclination is likely small ( of order a few degrees ) since a highly inclined hot strip would not reproduce the observed flat pulse .",
    "the best fit for the pencil plus fan beam model places the polar caps near to the spin pole ( which actually lies within the larger warm region ; see bottom of figure 3 ) but the highly anisotropic beaming pattern is still able to produce a large amplitude pulse .",
    "although for the pencil plus fan beam model two identical , antipodal polar caps were assumed , for the best fit geometry , the second polar cap resides in the region not visible to the observer . as a result ,",
    "identical results are obtained with a single polar cap and the properties of the second polar cap are poorly constrained .    for",
    "a given surface emission model and assumed stellar radius , the geometry and the location of the emission regions are very tightly constrained , owing to the unique morphology and large amplitude of the x - ray pulsations .",
    "it should be noted , however , if the possible values of the neutron star mass and radius , uncertain surface composition , and magnetic field strength are considered , the allowed range of the free parameters become quite large . in addition , although the x - ray emitting areas are assumed to be at two discrete temperatures , in reality , a smooth temperature gradient likely exists between the warm and hot regions .",

    "this strip may not in fact be contiguous , with a gap between the two `` polar strips '' , but at the phase resolution afforded by the photon statistics of the presently available data such a gap is not discernable .      as noted by @xcite and",
    "numerous subsequent works , the existence of hot areas that are a fraction of the total surface for ccos is difficult to reconcile with an intrinsically weakly magnetized neutron star ( i.e.  an `` anti - magnetar '' ) as it requires a mechanism to confine the heat to a small region . for strong fields ,",

    "this field acts as an insulator thus restricting the surface heat to a portion of the surface .    one plausible way to simultaneously account for the low apparent field as measured from spin - down and the strong sub - surface field required to explain the highly non - uniform surface heat distribution is to consider the fallback of the debris of the supernova explosion onto the newborn neutron star . in particular ,",
    "shortly after the violent explosion , the neutron star is believed to accrete material from the reverse shock at a rate greatly exceeding the eddington limit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this episode of so - called `` hyper - critical '' accretion could bury the magnetic field into the crust of the nascent neutron star , resulting in an apparent surface field substantially weaker relative to the internal `` hidden '' magnetic field @xcite .",
    "a post - supernova accretion episode of @xmath162 m@xmath56 over a large region of the surface is necessary to bury the magnetic field into the inner crust .",
    "this burial process can , in principle , result in crustal magnetic fields with @xmath2@xmath4 g , which in turn , produce high temperature contrast across the stellar surface , while still maintaining a low apparent surface field .",
    "the details of the current magnetic field topology presumably depend on the particular geometry of the supernova explosion ejecta , and may be the product of non - uniform fallback and/or low accretion rate ( see * ? ? ? * ) . in this scenario , the peculiar heat distributions of psrs j1852 + 0040 and j08214300 may be the direct result of the configuration of the fallback material .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that the natal magnetic field of the neutron star deviated significantly from a centered dipole field in the first place , possibly due to an off - center explosion @xcite , and the fallback uniformly submerged the field while still preserving the initial global configuration but with a much weaker surface field .",
    "+     an alternative interpretation for the restricted heat on the surface is on - going accretion of fall - back material at a sufficiently low rate via a thin disk .",
    "however , the steady spin - down over many years and the lack of evidence for any long - term x - ray variability do not favor this scenario .",
    "localized heating due to a return current , driven by the rotation of the magnetized star , is also not likely as it requires rotation - power to supply the energy , but the observed x - ray luminosity greatly exceeds the spin - down luminosity of the pulsar .",
    "i have presented modeling of the thermal x - ray pulsations from the central compact object and 105-millisecond x - ray pulsar psr j1852 + 0040 in the galactic supernova remnant kesteven 79 . unlike previous studies @xcite , the relatively simple models employed herein are able to simultaneously account for both the x - ray pulse amplitude and broad peak .",
    "the unusual morphology of the pulse profile can be reproduced with either : i ) a conventional antipodal polar cap model with a `` pencil plus fan '' beam intensity pattern ; or ii ) emission regions on the stellar surface that are significantly elongated in longitude ( i.e. , in the direction of rotation ) .",
    "although in the analysis presented above only approximations to emission models were considered for the sake of computational efficiency , the main findings are likely to remain valid for a more realistic treatment employing sophisticated atmosphere models of various surface magnetic field strengths and chemical compositions .    given that the observed thermal x - ray radiation from ccos is due to passive cooling , the inferred temperature distribution suggests highly anisotropic heat conduction from the stellar interior .",
    "as posited by several existing studies @xcite if the heated regions on the surface of psr j1852 + 0040 are closely associated with the magnetic field structure , strong magnetic fields beneath the stellar surface are required to channel heat to a relatively small portion of the star .",
    "the constraints on the heat distribution of psr j1852 + 0040 presented herein further support the argument that rather than being born with intrinsically weak fields , ccos possess strong `` hidden '' magnetic fields that were buried due to rapid accretion of fallback material shortly after the supernova explosion .",
    "this burial hypothesis avoids the requirement for a strong external global dipole magnetic field , which would manifest in the spin - down measurement .",
    "an offset dipole can provide a plausible explanation for the two surface temperature maps deduced in  3 for psr j1852 + 0040 , while still being consistent with the weak field inferred from the pulsar spin - down .",
    "in particular , for the `` pencil plus fan '' beaming model , the implied strong surface field ( @xmath0@xmath1 g ) needed to produce such a highly anisotropic emission pattern can be explained by a magnetic moment that is significantly displaced mostly along the axial direction of the dipole ( figure 7a ) .",
    "this configuration can also account for the two hot spots that differ greatly in size and temperature for the cco in puppis a , psr j08214300 .",
    "the linear geometry of the heated regions required for the isotropic and cosine beaming patterns can be produced if the offset of the dipole is in a direction orthogonal to the magnetic axis ( figure 7b ) .",
    "the large field displacements in both cases are possibly a consequence of an off - center supernova explosion .",
    "a phase - resolved spectroscopic analysis reveals no phase - dependent narrow - band features that could arise due to cyclotron absorption / scattering .",
    "in addition , although the same single - temperature c atmosphere model applied to the ccos in cas a and g353.60.7 produces a satisfactory fit to the spectrum of psr j1852 + 0040 , the implied emitting area at pulse maximum is comparable to the total neutron star surface area .",
    "this finding is difficult to reconcile with the observed large amplitude x - ray pulsations , suggesting that similar results obtained for other ccos , especially g353.60.7 , may not be valid as well .    in future investigations",
    ", it is important to employ realistic atmospheres in modeling the x - ray emission from psr j1852 + 0040 . as noted previously , since the exact magnetic field and chemical composition for ccos , in general , are quite uncertain , a wide variety of models need to be considered .",
    "moreover , substantially deeper x - ray observations are needed to better constrain the energy - dependence and reveal the small - scale details of the pulse profile , especially in the pulse peak and trough , to further constrain the details of the surface heat distribution and , by extension , the magnetic field topology . in the theoretical realm",
    ", it is crucial to investigate the surface heat signatures of non - standard magnetic field configurations ( e.g. ,  non - star - centered and non - axisymmetric ) , since they appear to be required to reproduce the phenomenology of psr j1852 + 0040 .",

    "<S> this lends further observational evidence in support of the `` hidden '' strong magnetic field scenario , in which ccos possess strong submerged magnetic fields that are substantially stronger than the external dipole field , presumably due to burial by fallback of supernova ejecta . </S>",
    "<S> i also conduct phase - resolved x - ray spectroscopy and find no evidence for prominent spin - phase - dependent absorption features that could be produced by cyclotron absorption / scattering . </S>"
