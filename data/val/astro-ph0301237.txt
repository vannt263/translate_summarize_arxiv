    "@xcite reported the discovery of a possible nova , later to be designated v838 monocerotis , on 2002 january 6.6 . prior to outburst ,",
    "v838 mon was a hot blue star , whose b band brightness was stable at 15.85 @xmath6 0.4 from 1949 - 1994 @xcite .",
    "@xcite noted that v838 mon was not detected in prior h@xmath0 emission - line surveys .",
    "a spectrum obtained on january 26 showed numerous neutral metal and s - process lines , and resembled that of a heavily reddened k - type giant @xcite .",
    "v838 monocerotis underwent a second major photometric outburst in early february 2002 , changing from v=10.708 on february 1.86 to v=8.024 on february 2.91 @xcite , and reaching a maximum brightness of 6.66 in v on february 6 @xcite .",
    "spectra obtained during and immediately following this outburst @xcite revealed the emergence of various ionized metal lines . @xcite",
    "estimated a blackbody continuum temperature of 4500 k to be present on february 9 , and @xcite found that a light echo had developed around v838 mon on february 17 .",
    "iras source 07015 - 0346 has been associated with the location of v838 mon @xcite , leading to the suggestion that this ir emission is from the dust causing the light echoes @xcite .    a third , less intense outburst occurred in early march 2002 @xcite .",
    "by april 16 , v838 mon s spectrum had evolved such that it resembled an m5 giant @xcite , with strong tio molecular bands and a temperature of @xmath73000 k. @xcite detected tii emission lines from near infrared spectroscopy , peaking in strength on may 2 , and argued that this emission arose from circumstellar ejecta .",
    "they used the strengths of these tii lines to estimate the mass of v838 mon s ejected envelope to be 10@xmath8 to 10@xmath9 m@xmath10 .    by october 2.17",
    ", spectroscopic observations suggested that v838 mon had evolved into a `` later than m10 iii '' type star @xcite .",
    "@xcite also detected a weak blue continuum , suggesting the presence of a binary companion .",
    "followup spectroscopy @xcite confirmed this detection , and @xcite suggested that the companion was a b3 v type star .",
    "the unique , complex evolution of v838 monocerotis has led @xcite to suggest that this object represents a new class of objects , `` stars erupting into cool supergiants ( secs ) '' .    in this paper",
    ", we report the spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric properties of v838 monocerotis following its second and third photometric outbursts . in section 2",
    ", we outline our observational data .",
    "we detail the equivalent width and line profile variability of selected spectral lines in section 3.1 .",
    "our spectropolarimetric data , most notably the detection of an intrinsic polarization component , are discussed in section 3.2 .",
    "we address the distance to v838 mon in section 3.3 .",
    "finally , in section 4 , we discuss the implications of these observations for future studies of this unique object .",
    "we obtained spectroscopic observations of v838 monocerotis with the ritter observatory 1 m reflector , using a fiber - fed echelle spectrograph .",
    "the fiber used for these observations has a diameter of 200 @xmath11 m , which corresponds to roughly 5@xmath12 on the sky .",
    "nine non - adjacent orders of width 70   were observed in the range 5285 -6595  .",
    "data were recorded on a 1200 x 800 wright instruments ltd .",
    "ccd , with 22.5 x 22.5 @xmath11 m pixels . with @xmath13 the spectral resolution element , @xmath14 , is about 4.2 pixels owing to a widened entrance slit .",
    "observations were reduced with iraf using standard techniques .",
    "further details about the reduction of ritter data can be found in @xcite . unless otherwise noted ,",
    "all data were shifted to the heliocentric rest frame and continuum normalized .",
    "we obtained spectropolarimetric observations of v838 mon with the university of wisconsin s hpol spectropolarimeter , which is the dedicated instrument on the 0.9 m pine bluff observatory ( pbo ) telescope .",
    "these data were recorded with a 400 x 1200 pixel ccd camera , covering the wavelength range of 3200 -10500 , with a spectral resolution of 7  below 6000  and 10  above this point @xcite .",
    "observations were made with dual 6 x 12 arc - second apertures , with the 6 arc - second slit aligned e - w and the 12 arc - second decker aligned n - s on the sky .",
    "the two apertures allow simultaneous star and sky data to be recorded , providing a reliable means for subtraction of background sky polarization and hence allowing accurate observations to be made even in non - photometric skies .",
    "we processed these data using reduce , a spectropolarimetric software package developed by the university of wisconsin - madison @xcite .",
    "further details about hpol and reduce may be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "instrumental polarization is monitored on a weekly to monthly basis at pbo via observations of polarized and unpolarized standard stars , and over its 13 year existence , hpol has proven to be a very stable instrument .",
    "we have corrected our data for instrumental effects to an absolute accuracy of @xmath15 and 1@xmath16 in the v band ( nordsieck , private communication ) .",
    "hpol spectroscopic data are not calibrated to an absolute flux level due to the non - photometric skies routinely present @xcite .",
    "table 1 provides a log of the observations from both observatories .",
    "we now discuss the spectral evolutionary history of v838 monocerotis from february 5 to march 14 .",
    "our observations of v838 mon from february 5 to february 9 , during the onset of the second photometric outburst , indicate an overall shift toward a higher ionization state @xcite as compared with initial observations @xcite .    h@xmath0 shows a strong p - cygni profile , with electron scattering wings extending at least @xmath6 1100 km s@xmath17 from february 5 to february 8 and about 850 km s@xmath17 on february 9 , and an average heliocentric blue edge radial velocity of -300 km s@xmath17 ( see figure 1 ) . this radial velocity is slightly lower than the terminal velocity of -500 km s@xmath17 observed in late january in caii , baii , nai , and lii lines @xcite .",
    "@xcite report that a spectrum on february 5 shows h@xmath0 with fwzi = 3100 km s@xmath17 and an absorption component at -300 km s@xmath17 , which is inconsistent with our findings .",
    "the extent of the electron scattering wings strongly depends on accurate continuum placement .",
    "we are confident that , within the limits of the snr of our data , we see a 5   `` flat '' continuum region at each end of the spectral interval containing h@xmath0 , hence we are accurately determining the continuum level .",
    "the total equivalent width peaked on february 6 ( see table 3 ) , and then began a steady decrease .",
    "equivalent width errors were calculated using @xmath18 , where n is the number of pixels across a line , @xmath19 is the dispersion in   pixel@xmath17 , @xmath20 is the flux in the line , @xmath21 is the flux at the continuum , and snr is the signal to noise ratio @xcite .    in early february",
    ", all the strong lines exhibited significant line profile variability . in h@xmath0 ( figure 1 ) , the emission peak migrated to longer wavelengths with time .",
    "the high velocity component of si ii 6347.1  and 6371.4  ( figure 2 ) weakens with time , and the instrinsic component of na i 5889.95  and 5895.9  ( figure 3 ) also shows variability .",
    "note that since the interstellar na i components appear to be saturated , they could not fit with gaussians and subtracted to reveal the pure intrinsic component .",
    "the low resolution hpol spectrum ( figure 4 ) on february 8 clearly depicts the p - cygni profiles of feii 4923.9 , 5018.4 , 5169.0  and the caii infrared triplet 8498.0 , 8542.1 , 8662.1 .",
    "hydrogen paschen absorption lines at 8438.0 , 8467.3 , 8598.4 , 8750.5 , 8862.8 , 9014.9 , 9229.0  are observed , as well as hi 10049.4 , which has a clear p - cygni profile .    by february 14",
    ", the p - cygni profile of h@xmath0 had weakened considerably(table 3 , figure 1 ) and its absorption and emission components were approaching equality in strength .",
    "the strong electron scattering wings previously observed had disappeared by our february 14 observation .",
    "@xcite noted that the h@xmath0 electron scattering wings had disappeared in their spectrum taken on february 16 .",
    "these results are consistent with a decreasing excitation level in the circumstellar envelope . a low resolution",
    "red hpol spectrum , obtained on february 13 ( figure 6 ) , reveals two other qualitative changes : the emission components of both the p - cygni caii infrared triplet lines and hi 10049.4  line significantly decreased in strength .    by the end of the third photometric outburst ,",
    "a significant shift in v838 mon s spectral characteristics had occurred .",
    "specifically , our spectra on march 11 showed that a second , high velocity absorption component had developed in a few lines .",
    "( figure 1 ) clearly shows this component , centered at a radial velocity of -200 km s@xmath17 with a blue edge radial velocity of -280 km s@xmath17 .",
    "figure 2 shows that this feature is also present in the siii 6347.1  line , centered at -200 km s@xmath17 with a blue edge radial velocity of -260 km s@xmath17 , and in the siii 6371.4  line , centered at -140 km s@xmath17 with a blue edge radial velocity of -190 km s@xmath17 .",
    "based upon the radial velocities of these dual absorption features , we identify the enormous p - cygni profile around 6394 , seen in figure 2 , as fei 6393.6 .",
    "a strong p - cygni profiled line in the vicinity of 6190 , which we attribute to fei 6191.6 , also emerged on march 11 ( figure 5 ) .",
    "figure 1 also reveals new spectroscopic features at 6544.9 , 6577.2 , and 6582.5  , which we attribute to mgii 6545.9  and cii 6578.1 and 6582.9 .",
    "the apparent emergence of both higher excitation lines ( cii and mgii ) simultaneously with lower excitation lines ( fei ) illustrates the complexity of v838 mon s outburst .",
    "in fact , nearly all 9 orders of our spectra show evidence for the emergence of new spectral features on march 11 and march 14 . due to low signal to noise ratios , as well as uncertainties in line blending and profile shapes , we are unable to identify all lines definitively . since many of these lines are consistent with the rest wavelengths of fei , nei , nii , tiii , mgii , and feii , and since as noted above we have positively identified two lines of fei emerging on march 11 , these results indicate that v838 mon began to experience a shift to a lower ionization state . the evidence for spectral evolution that we observed will need to be combined with that of other authors to portray a comprehensive picture of v838 mon s outbursts .",
    "figures 5 - 6 illustrate the wavelength dependent polarization of v838 mon on february 8 and february 13 respectively .",
    "the differences between these two observations are readily apparent .",
    "the integrated johnson r band polarization of the february 8 data is @xmath22 at a position angle of @xmath23 , while the r band polarization of the later observation is @xmath24 at a position angle of @xmath25 .",
    "this change strongly suggests the presence of an intrinsic polarization component .",
    "furthermore , the february 8 data are characterized by strongly depolarized emission lines , while the february 13 polarimetric data show no line features .",
    "polarimetric studies of be stars @xcite have found that in contrast to continuum photons , line emission , which predominantly originates in be circumstellar disks , has a low probability of being scattered .",
    "with a few exceptions @xcite , emission lines should show little to no intrinsic polarization .",
    "thus an intrinsically polarized emission line star should exhibit depolarized emission lines , e.g. a superposition of polarized continuum flux and unpolarized line flux .",
    "if one employs a similar argument with the ejecta of v838 mon , the strongly depolarized emission lines of february 8 may be used to infer the interstellar polarization component ( isp ) .",
    "similarly , the absence of depolarization effects in the february 13 data suggests that this polarization minima may be primarily attributed to interstellar polarization .",
    "as previously noted , the electron scattering wings of h@xmath0 disappeared by february 14 . since one expects electron scattering in the ejecta of v838 mon to be the primary source of any intrinsic polarization , the disappearance of the electron scattering wings is consistent with the hypothesis that the polarization signal observed on february 13 is primarily interstellar in nature .    in order to parametrize the wavelength dependence of the interstellar polarization in the february 13 data , we fitted the empirical serkowski law @xcite , as modified by @xcite to these data .",
    "the resulting isp parameters are : @xmath1 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "this fit is overlaid in figures 5 -6 .",
    "this serkowski fit provides a near perfect fit to the february 13 observation ; furthermore , it nicely fits the depolarized emission lines in the february 8 observation .",
    "we qualitatively crosscheck this claim by using the polarization and extinction relationship , formulated by @xcite , @xmath30 .",
    "@xcite established a lower limit for the interstellar reddening of e@xmath31 and suggested that the finding of @xcite , e@xmath32 = 0.80 @xmath6 0.05 , represents an upper limit . following the arguments of @xcite",
    ", we adopt the midpoint of these values , e@xmath32 = 0.50 , which bounds the interstellar polarization along the line of sight to v838 mon by @xmath33 , and thus qualitatively agrees with our isp determination .",
    "@xcite reported preliminary polarimetry results in which they suggested the isp is characterized by @xmath34 at 5500   at a position angle of @xmath35 .",
    "we are thus confident that our parametrization accurately describes the interstellar polarization component .",
    "we used these serkowski parameters to remove the isp component from the february 8 data , as seen in figure 4 , leaving only the intrinsic component .",
    "we find the integrated v band intrinsic polarization to be @xmath36 at a position angle of @xmath5 .",
    "it is interesting that the intrinsic polarization is clearly not wavelength independent , which one would expect in the case of pure electron scattering .",
    "rather , the polarization gradually increases at wavelengths shortward and longward of @xmath7 8000 , which suggests the presence of an absorptive opacity source in v838 mon s ejecta . a possible paschen jump , albeit only at a one - sigma detection level",
    ", is visible in the raw and intrinsic polarization in figure 4 .",
    "combined with the spectroscopic observations of strong h@xmath0 electron scattering wings on february 8 , this might suggest a not unlikely speculation that hydrogen is the opacity source @xcite .",
    "the distance to v838 mon has yet to be agreed upon .",
    "@xcite followed the propagation of v838 mon s light echo , assuming a spherical distribution of scattering material , to derive a distance of 790 @xmath6 30 pc .",
    "@xcite used the same technique on a different data set to estimate a distance of 640 to 680 pc . @xcite",
    "estimated a distance of 2.5 kpc from hst light echo images ; however , it has been suggested that the geometry assumed by these authors is unrealistic @xcite .",
    "more recently , the reported detection of a hot binary companion @xcite has led @xcite to suggest a distance of 10 - 11 kpc , based upon spectrophotometric parallax .",
    "we add to the above discussion by considering the distance implied by our spectroscopic and polarimetric observations .",
    "based upon the assumption that cataclysmic variables contain no intrinsic polarization , @xcite suggested a rough relationship between polarization and distance . when applied to sources near the galactic plane , for distances @xmath37 1 kpc , this relation is given by @xmath38 kpc@xmath17 .",
    "given our estimate of @xmath39 of @xmath40 , this would suggest a distance to v838 mon of 763 pc .",
    "v838 mon s strong , double interstellar na i d lines provide a different constraint on the distance . at galactic longitude 217.8@xmath41 , radial velocities of objects outside the solar circle are positive and increase monotonically with increasing distance from the sun .",
    "thus , the radial velocity of the longer wavelength component provides a lower limit on the distance to v838 mon .",
    "the radial velocities of the two components of the d lines were measured in the spectra of february 5 , 6 , 8 , and 9 . for d1 and d2 ,",
    "the means and standard deviations were , respectively , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 km s@xmath17 , relative to the lsr .",
    "note that our data are accurate to 2 km s@xmath17 , as compared to the iau velocity standard @xmath46 gem , which is constant to better than 0.1 km s@xmath17 @xcite .    to read off the distance of the 48 km s@xmath17 , further cloud",
    ", we used the velocity contour map by @xcite , which does not assume the velocity field of galactic rotation to be axisymmetric .",
    "the galactic longitude of v838 mon coincides with an interesting feature in this map , an `` island '' of high velocities of about 50 km s@xmath17 located about 2500 pc from the sun .",
    "we estimate that distances consistent with this velocity map , for a radial velocity of + 48 km s@xmath17 , lie in the range @xmath47 pc .",
    "this estimate constitutes our lower limit on the distance to v838 mon .",
    "velocities as large as 50 km s@xmath17 are not reached again in this direction at heliocentric distances less than 8 kpc .",
    "since this lower limit is greater than 1 kpc , the distance estimation technique used with our polarimetric data is no longer applicable .",
    "our spectroscopic data offer both qualitative and quantitative insight into the initial stages of the 2002 outburst .",
    "future modeling efforts can be constrained by the equivalent width variability of the lines presented .",
    "furthermore , the complex line profile variability and evolution of various species and ionization stages of lines presented in this paper should also provide constraints on future attempts to explain this outburst .    in spite of our sparse polarimetric data set",
    ", these observations clearly demonstrate that the ejecta of v838 monocerotis deviated significantly from a spherical geometry .",
    "we note the similarity between our observations and those of @xcite , who found nova cygni 1992 to have an intrinsic polarization signal during the initial stages of outburst .",
    "these authors suggest the intrinsic polarization during this initial stage was caused by electron scattering in a slightly flattened spheroidal shell . as the shell expanded , the electron scattering optical depth decreased , hence the intrinsic polarization declined .",
    "a similar interpretation could be applied to v838 mon .",
    "the electron scattering wings around h@xmath0 were sizable on february 5 , but had clearly weakened by february 9 and disappeared by february 14 . coupled with our discovery of an intrinsic polarization component present on february 8 but gone by february 13 , this picture of an expanding ,",
    "flattened spheroidal shell could provide a viable explanation of the intrinsic polarization observed during the 2002 outburst .    finally , we consider the implications of these observations for future studies of this object . @xcite and @xcite",
    "discuss different classifications of v838 mon , including a nova outburst , a post - agb star , a m31-red type variable , and a v4332 sgr type variable : both suggest that v838 mon is most similar to a v4332 sgr type variable .",
    "as described above , we suggest that the geometry of the outburst , as probed by polarimetry , might be similar to that of a nova outburst .",
    "this suggests that the geometry of v4332 sgr s , v838 mon s , and nova outbursts might be similar",
    ". it would be worthwhile to measure the polarization of v4332 sgr today , to verify that like v838 mon , it has no intrinsic polarization at a time long after outburst .",
    "furthermore , we suggest that polarimetric observations immediately following the outbursts of all future v4332 sgr type variables be made . such observations would provide an ideal testbed to correlate the geometry of each outburst , and hence help to identify the true nature of these unique objects .",
