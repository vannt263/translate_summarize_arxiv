    "the possible existence of light scalar mesons ( with masses less than about 1 gev ) has been a controversial subject for roughly forty years .",
    "there are two aspects : the extraction of the scalar properties from experiment and their underlying quark substructure .",
    "because the @xmath7 channels may contain strong competing contributions , such resonances may not necessarily dominate their amplitudes and could be hard to  observe `` .",
    "in such an instance their verification would be linked to the model used to describe them .",
    "the last few years have seen a revival of interest in this area . as examples ,",
    "three models for the underlying quark structure have been discussed by many authors , including other contributors to this workshop@xcite : i ) the @xmath8 molecule model @xcite , ii ) the @xmath9 model with strong meson - meson interactions ( or ' ' unitarized quark model\")@xcite , iii ) the intrinsic @xmath10 model ( jaffe type@xcite ) .",
    "these models have the common feature that four quarks are involved in some form ; all are different from the  simple \" @xmath9 model .",
    "clearly , the elucidation of the structure of unusual low lying states can be expected to increase our understanding of non - perturbative qcd .",
    "the present approach is based on comparing with experiment , the predictions for @xmath0 scattering , @xmath1 scattering and @xmath11 decay from a phenomenological chiral lagrangian containing particles of mass comparable to the energy regime of interest .",
    "these studies seem to require for consistency the existence of two isoscalars @xmath3 and @xmath5 , an isospinor @xmath4 and an isovector @xmath6 with given properties .",
    "note that in the effective lagrangian approach , the quark substructure of the scalars is not specified .",
    "in particular a nonet field can _ a priori _ represent either @xmath9 or @xmath12 ( or even more complicated ) states . from this point of view",
    "our approach is  model independent \" .",
    "section ii contains a brief summary of our scattering model in the @xmath0 case .",
    "the generalization to the @xmath1 case and to @xmath13 decay is even more briefly summarized in section iii .",
    "section iv deals with the  family properties \" of the nonet made up from the scalars we need .",
    "the model of  ideal mixing \" for meson nonets is reviewed and generalized to include  dual ideal mixing \" .",
    "the realistic situation is noted to be closer to dual rather than ordinary ideal mixing .",
    "finally , in section v , a possible mechanism is proposed to explain some puzzling features of a presumably more conventional next  to  lowest  lying scalar nonet .",
    "the most difficult partial wave amplitude to explain is just the scalar channel with @xmath14 .",
    "our notation for the partial wave is @xmath15 .",
    "the complicated shape of the experimentally obtained @xmath16 shown in figs . 2 and 3 below suggests that resonances are present .",
    "close to threshold , the chiral perturbation theory approach , which essentially supplies a taylor expansion of the amplitude , is very accurate .",
    "however explaining the data shown to about 1.2 gev would appear to require a prohibitively high order of expansion in this scheme .",
    "thus we sacrifice some accuracy near threshold and use instead an expansion of the invariant amplitude in terms of resonance exchange diagrams ( including contact terms needed for chiral symmetry ) .",
    "this holds the possibility of achieving a fit to experiment over a larger energy regime .",
    "some theoretical support for such an approach comes from the leading order in @xmath17 approximation to qcd , which features just tree diagrams .    in detail",
    ", we calculate the tree diagrams of our model from an effective chiral lagrangian which contains resonances but has interactions with a minimal ( for simplicity ) number of derivatives",
    ". hence the initial computed amplitude will be ( as in the @xmath17 expansion ) purely real .",
    "this suggests that it is most sensible in the present approach to compare with the real part of the experimental amplitude . of course we still must find a way to  regularize \" the infinities which arise at the direct channel poles .",
    "we interpret the  regularization \" procedure as equivalent to enforcing unitarity in the vicinity of the direct channel pole . in the case of a narrow isolated resonance",
    "we adopt the usual breit  wigner procedure in which the offending term in the amplitude is replaced as    @xmath18    in the case of a very broad resonance we instead replace @xmath19 where @xmath20 , which is not required to equal @xmath21 , is taken as a fitting parameter .",
    "finally , in the case of a  narrow \" resonance in a non trivial background ( characterized by a phase shift @xmath22 in the resonance partial wave ) we replace , @xmath23    this method can be trivially modified to give a crossing symmetric invariant amplitude but unitarity may easily be violated in general .",
    "we thus choose the parameters for a putative @xmath24 meson represented by ( [ reg2 ] ) to fit experiment .",
    "we then end up with an amplitude@xcite which approximately satisfies unitarity and crossing symmetry .",
    "this is illustrated in a step by step manner in figs . 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "the real part of the partial wave amplitude @xmath25 is obtained by projecting out the real part of the s ",
    "wave @xmath26 component of the chiral invariant and crossing symmetric invariant amplitude .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "1 that the  current algebra \" piece starts violating the unitarity bound , @xmath27 at about 0.5 gev and then runs away .",
    "however the inclusion of the @xmath28 meson exchange diagrams turns the curve in the right direction and improves , but does not completely cure , the unitarity violation .",
    "this feature , which does not involve any unknown parameters , gives encouragment to our hope that the cooperative interplay of various pieces at tree level can explain the low energy scattering . in order to fix up fig .",
    "1 we note that the real part of a resonance contribution vanishes at the pole , is positive before the pole and _ negative _ above the pole",
    ". thus a scalar resonance with a pole about 0.5 gev ( where @xmath25 in fig .",
    "1 needs a negative contribution to stay below @xmath29 ) should do the job .",
    "the result of including such a @xmath24 meson , parametrized as in ( [ reg2 ] ) , is shown in fig .",
    "2 . now note that the predicted @xmath16 in fig .",
    "2 vanishes around 1 gev .",
    "thus the phase @xmath22 at 1 gev ( assumed to keep rising ) is about @xmath30 there .",
    "considering this as a background phase for the known @xmath5 , eq([reg3 ] ) shows us that the real part of the @xmath5 contribution will get reversed in sign ( ramsauer  townsend effect ) . this is the missing piece in the jig",
    " saw puzzle as fig .",
    "up to about 1.2 gev , the amplitude @xmath31 can be explained as the sum of current algebra , @xmath28 exchange , @xmath3 exchange and @xmath5 exchange pieces .",
    "a similar treatment was carried out for the @xmath7 partial wave amplitudes of @xmath1 scattering@xcite . in this case",
    "the low energy amplitude is taken to correspond to the sum of a current algebra contact diagram , vector @xmath28 and @xmath33 exchange diagrams and scalar @xmath3 , @xmath5 and @xmath4 exchange diagrams .",
    "the situation in the interesting @xmath34 channel turns out to be very analogous to the @xmath26 channel of s - wave @xmath0 scattering .",
    "now a @xmath4 parametrized as in ( [ reg2 ] ) is required to restore unitarity ; it plays the role of the @xmath3 in the @xmath0 case .",
    "following our criterion we expect that to extend this treatment to the 1.5 gev region , one should include the many possible exchanges of particles with masses up to about 1.5 gev .",
    "nevertheless we found that a satisfactory description of the 1 - 1.5 gev s - wave region is obtained simply by including the well known @xmath35 scalar resonance , which plays the role of the @xmath5 in the @xmath0 calculation .",
    "the @xmath32 process is a strong decay which yields information about the properties of the scalar @xmath6 isovector resonance .",
    "the tree diagrams , which are similar to those of @xmath36 scattering in our model@xcite , include @xmath6 , @xmath3 and @xmath5 exchanges .",
    "compared to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 scatterings there is a simplification in that g - parity invariance prevents vector meson exchange diagrams from contributing .",
    "the associated  current algebra \" contact diagrams also vanish .",
    "it was found that fitting the model to the experimental dalitz plot and the rate gave @xmath6 properties consistent with the recent experimental ones .",
    "the nine states associated with the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are required in order to fit experiment in our model .",
    "what do their masses and coupling constants suggest about their quark substructure ? ( see @xcite for more details . )",
    "suppose we first try to assign them to a conventional @xmath9 nonet :    @xmath37    then there are two puzzles .",
    "i ) why are nt the @xmath6 and the @xmath3 , which have the same number of non  strange quarks , degenerate ?",
    "ii ) why are nt these particles , being p  wave states , in the same 1 + gev energy region as the other p  wave states ?    to study this , first note that most meson multiplets can be nicely understood using the concept of  ideal mixing \" . in okubo",
    "s formulation @xcite , originally applied to the vector meson multiplet , the meson fields are grouped into a nonet matrix , @xmath38 , \\label{nonet}\\ ] ] where the particle names have been chosen to fit the scalar mesons .",
    "the two @xmath26 states are the su(3 ) singlet , @xmath39 and the su(3 ) octet member , @xmath40 .",
    "ansatz for the mass terms was , @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are real constants and @xmath44 ( with @xmath45 ) is the  spurion \" matrix which breaks flavor su(3 ) invariance . with ( [ nonet ] ) and ( [ mass ] ) the @xmath46 singlet and su(3 )",
    "octet isoscalar states mix in such a way ( ideal mixing ) that the physical mass eigenstates emerge as @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore there are two mass relations @xmath49 note that there are two different solutions depending on the sign of @xmath43 . if @xmath50 we get okubo s original case where [ with the identifications @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 there is the conventional ordering @xmath55 this agrees with counting the number of ( heavier ) strange quarks when we identify @xmath56 .    on the other hand if @xmath57 and we identify @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the resulting ordering would be @xmath60 which is in nice agreement with the present  observed \" scalar spectrum . but this clearly does not agree with counting the number of strange quarks while assuming that the scalar mesons are simple quark anti - quark composites .",
    "this unusual ordering will agree with counting the number of strange quarks if we assume instead that the scalar mesons are schematically constructed as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a  dual \" quark .",
    "specifically @xmath63 \\label{dualnonet}\\ ] ] note in particular that the light @xmath64 contains no strange quarks .",
    "while this picture seems unusual , precisely the configuration ( [ dualnonet ] ) was found by jaffe @xcite in the framework of the mit bag model .",
    "the key dynamical point is that the states in ( [ dualnonet ] ) receive ( due to the spin and color spin recoupling coefficients ) exceptionally large binding energy from the  hyperfine \" piece of the gluon exchange interchange : @xmath65 wherein the sum goes over all pairs @xmath66 while @xmath67 and @xmath68 are respectively the spin and color generators acting on the @xmath69 quark or antiquark .",
    "while the picture above seems close to our expectations it is not quite right in detail .",
    "for example the masses do not exactly obey ( [ massrelations ] ) .",
    "furthermore the simplest model for decay would give that @xmath70 vanishes , in contradiction to experiment .",
    "hence we add the extra mass terms @xmath71 the @xmath72 and @xmath73 terms give @xmath74 mixing .",
    "now we solve for @xmath75 in terms of the four masses @xmath76550 mev , @xmath77900mev , @xmath78983.5 mev and @xmath79980 mev .",
    "the solution boils down to a quadratic equation for ( say ) @xmath73 .",
    "this gives two possible values for the mixing angle @xmath80 defined by , @xmath81 the solution @xmath82 , giving @xmath83 seems to correspond to restoring the @xmath9 model ( [ conven ] ) for the scalars once more .",
    "the other solution @xmath84 corresponds to @xmath24 being mainly @xmath48 which was just noted to be a characteristic signature of the @xmath12 model ( [ dualnonet ] ) .",
    "the very existence of these two different solutions highlights the fact that by just assuming a flavor transformation property for the scalars we are not forcing a particular identification of their underlying quark structure .",
    "different substructures are naturally associated with different values of the parameters in the same effective lagrangian . in any event ,",
    "the extra terms in ( [ fullmass ] ) have restored the ambiguity about the scalars structure . we need more information to decide the issue . for this purpose",
    "we look at the trilinear couplings .    using su(3 )",
    "invariance we write @xmath85 where @xmath86",
    "are four real constants and @xmath87 represents the usual pseudoscalar nonet matrix .",
    "the derivatives stem from the requirement that ( [ trilinear ] ) be the leading part of a chiral invariant object .",
    "if desired , we can rewrite the @xmath88 term as a linear combination of the usual tr@xmath89 and the three other terms .",
    "the motivation for the form given is that by itself the @xmath88 term yields zero for @xmath70 and @xmath90 , both of which should vanish in the  fall apart \" picture of a @xmath91 type scalar meson .",
    "note that all the coupling constants which enter into our treatment of @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering depend on just @xmath88 and @xmath92 ; @xmath93 and @xmath94 contribute only to the decays containing @xmath95 or @xmath96 in the final state . for examples of couplings : @xmath97    the mixing angle solution which best fits the couplings needed to explain the @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering turns out to be @xmath84 .",
    "together with a suitable choice of @xmath93 and @xmath94 , the interactions involving @xmath95 and @xmath96 are also consistently described ( as mentioned in section iii ) .",
    "thus it seems that our results point to a picture in which the light scalars are mainly dual quark- dual antiquark rather than quark - antiquark type .",
    "very recently achasov @xcite has argued that new experimental data from novosibirsk on the radiative decay @xmath98 are better fit with a @xmath12 type model of the @xmath6 .    to sum up : assuming @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 to belong to a nonet @xmath99 which is fitted into a chiral lagrangian , we have found the parameters @xmath86 which specify sixteen scalar - pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar coupling constants .",
    "these couplings and masses are used to explain @xmath0 scattering ( @xmath100 ) , @xmath1 scattering ( @xmath101 ) and @xmath32 ( @xmath102 ) with regularized tree amplitudes .",
    "furthermore , a small @xmath103 mixing angle in ( [ sf_mix ] ) suggests that @xmath99 is describing a structure similar to a dual quark - dual antiquark .",
    "if this picture is correct there are many interesting applications and questions .",
    "of course , the success of the phenomenological quark model suggests that there exists a nonet of  conventional \" @xmath9 scalars in the 1 + gev range .",
    "what are the experimental candidates for these ?",
    "@xcite the situation for the isoscalar candidates is presently confusing .",
    "the @xmath104 may actually correspond to two different states .",
    "the @xmath105 may be a glueball while the @xmath106 does not necessarily have spin zero .",
    "thus we will not focus on the isoscalars now . on the other hand the review of particle physics",
    " endorses \" the isovector and isospinor candidates @xmath107    on the way to taking these states seriously as members of an ordinary p - wave nonet we encounter three puzzles .",
    "i ) the mass of the @xmath108 ( presumably a @xmath109 state is greater than that of the @xmath110 ( presumably a @xmath111 state ) .",
    "ii ) the @xmath112 and @xmath35 are not less massive than the corresponding p - wave tensor mesons @xmath113 and @xmath114 , as expected from an @xmath115 interaction ( e.g. @xmath116>m[\\chi_{c0}(1p)]$ ] ) .",
    "iii ) assuming the known decay modes @xmath117 and @xmath118 saturate the total widths , we have from su(3 ) flavor invariance that @xmath119 = 1.51 \\gamma[k_0^*(1430)]$ ] . however , experimentally it is @xmath120 $ ] instead .",
    "these puzzles can be simply resolved@xcite if we assume that an ideally mixed heavier @xmath9 nonet @xmath121 in turn mixes with an ideally mixed @xmath91 nonet @xmath122 ( as in ( [ dualnonet ] ) ) via @xmath123 actually the assumption of exact ideal mixings is a simplification which can be relaxed .",
    "the mechanism is driven by the fact that @xmath124 while @xmath125 . here",
    "the subscript zero refers to the unmixed @xmath122 and @xmath121 members .",
    "the splittings are summarized in fig .",
    "4 .      the explanations are : i)think of a perturbation theory approach .",
    "there is a smaller  energy denominator \" for @xmath126 mixing than for @xmath127 mixing .",
    "thus there is more @xmath126 repulsion as shown in fig .",
    "ii ) since the mixing of two levels  repels \" them , both @xmath112 and @xmath35 are heavier than would be expected otherwise .",
    "similarly the light scalars @xmath6 and @xmath4 are lighter than they would be without the mixing ( [ nonetmixing ] ) .",
    "iii ) the difference between the @xmath112 and @xmath35 decay coupling constants can be understood from the necessarily greater mixture of the @xmath12 component in the @xmath112 than in the @xmath35 .",
