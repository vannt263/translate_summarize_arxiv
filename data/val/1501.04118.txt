    "the existence of a large population of obscured agn has been recognized for as long as agn have been known .",
    "the vast majority of well - studied obscured objects , however , are local , of relatively low bolometric luminosity .",
    "the fraction of obscured agn at the high ( quasar ) end of the agn luminosity function , where the population is at cosmological distances has been the subject of debate .",
    "reliable statistics exist only for the @xmath4% of radio - loud agn , where luminous radio galaxies are seen to exist in similar numbers to radio - loud quasars when selected on an isotropic property such as low frequency radio emission ( e.g.  willott et al .",
    "the situation for radio - quiet objects is less certain , and it is only in the last decade that progress has been made in quantifying the population of dust obscured radio - quiet quasars through advances in x - ray , optical and mid - infrared selection techniques .",
    "selection of agn in the mid - infrared allows the discovery of powerful agn and quasars whose optical and soft x - ray emission is hidden by dust ( e.g.lacy et al .",
    "2004 , 2007 ; stern et al .  2005 ; 2012 ; martnez - sansigre et al.2005 ; donley et al .",
    "2012 ; eisenhardt et al .",
    "mid - infrared selection has the powerful characteristic that it permits the selection of samples of agn containing both moderately obscured and unobscured objects of similar bolometric luminosities , allowing an estimate to be made of the importance of the obscured agn population to the agn population as a whole .",
    "mid - infrared selection is also a useful complement to other techniques for finding obscured quasars such as hard x - rays ( norman et al .",
    "2002 ; brusa et al .",
    "2010 ) , which tend to be restricted to smaller fields and thus lower - luminosity objects , and optical techniques based on narrow - line emission ( zakamska et al .  2003 ; alexandroff et al .",
    "2013 ) , which are restricted to redshift ranges in which strong emission lines fall .",
    "mid - infared selection has its limitations , for example , juneau et al .",
    "( 2013 ) show that , at @xmath5 and low luminosities ( @xmath6 ) , both x - ray and mid - infrared selection miss a large fraction of agn that are recovered by the mass - excitation technique , an optical diagnostic which compares the [ oiii]/h@xmath7 ratio to the stellar mass ( juneau et al .",
    "these objects are probably of such low luminosity that hot dust emission does not stand out against stellar light in mid - infrared color - color plots .",
    "similar incompletenesses to lower luminosity agn have been noted by hickox et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , park et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , mendez et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and messias et al .",
    "in particular , messias et al .  show that the completeness of the agn selection technique of lacy et al .",
    "( 2007 ) rises from @xmath1% compared to x - ray selection at x - ray luminosities @xmath8 to 100% complete at @xmath9 ( i.e.  5@xmath10 m luminosities @xmath11 to @xmath12 ) .",
    "nevertheless , mid - infrared selection finds many agn that are missing from x - ray surveys even at low luminosities ( e.g.  park et al .",
    "2008 ) , so mid - infrared remains a powerful technique for finding agn .    quantifying the abundance of the obscured population is important for two reasons .",
    "first , it affects the argument of soltan ( 1982 ) , where the total amount of matter accreting onto black holes is compared to the remnant black hole mass density today .",
    "the comparison allows us to estimate the mean value of the radiative efficiency of accretion , @xmath13 , which varies from @xmath14 for a non - rotating ( schwartzshild ) black hole to @xmath15 for a maximally - rotating kerr black hole .",
    "previous estimates suggest @xmath16 ( e.g.  hopkins , richards & hernquist 2007 , hereafter h07 ; martnez - sansigre & taylor 2009 ; delvecchio et al .  2014 ) , though an analysis of the x - ray background ( elvis , risaliti & zamorani 2002 ) suggests a higher bound , @xmath17 , consistent with most black holes spinning and with current agn censuses being significantly incomplete . the second reason is to aid in our understanding of unified schemes of agn . in the standard orientation - based unified scheme ( e.g. antonucci 1993 ) , the ratio of obscured to unobscured quasars defines the opening angle of the obscuring torus .",
    "( in a refinement of this model , elitzur ( 2012 ) suggests that the clumpy nature of the torus means that on an object - by - object basis the angle to the line of sight is only a statistical predictor of obscuration , nevertheless the obscured to unobscured ratio is still related to the torus opening angle in a statistical sense . )",
    "the luminosity dependence of the obscured to unobscured ratio ( lawrence 1991 ; simpson 2005 ; gilli , comastri & hasinger 2007 ; lusso et al .",
    "2013 ) has been put forward as evidence of the `` receding torus '' model in which more luminous objects are able to move the inner radius of the obscuring torus out , reducing the covering factor of the dust .",
    "competing with this theory , in the case of high luminosity and ( especially ) high redshift quasars is the evolutionary theory , whereby quasars begin life highly obscured as a result of mergers of dusty galaxies and eventually break out from their cocoons of dust and gas due to outflows ( sanders et al .  1988 ; hopkins et al .",
    "2008 ) . in this case",
    "the ratio of obscured to unobscured objects can be used to estimate the fraction of its lifetime that a quasar exists in the obscured state .    to date , estimates of the fraction of dust - obscured quasars have been affected by either small sample size ( martnez - sansigre et al .  2005 ; lacy et al .",
    "2007 ) , a restricted redshift range based on a requirement that [ oiii ] be detected in an optical spectrum ( e.g. reyes et al .  2008 ) , or a very specific infrared color selection ( assef et al .",
    "all these estimates suggest that the obscured population of quasars equals or exceeds the unobscured population in space density , even at high luminosities . to increase the sample size available to us ,",
    "we have undertaken a larger survey ( detailed in lacy et al .",
    "2013 ; hereafter paper i ) .",
    "this survey is drawn from the 54 deg@xmath18 covered by the _",
    "spitzer _ wide - area infrared extragalactic survey ( swire ; lonsdale et al .",
    "2003 ) and the _ spitzer _ extragalatic first look survey ( xfls ; lacy et al .  2005 ; fadda et al .",
    "agn and quasars were selected on the basis of their mid - infrared properties from several samples flux - limited at 24@xmath10 m , with flux density limits ranging from @xmath190.61 - 9.6mjy .",
    "further selection based on mid - infrared colors at 3.6 - 8.0@xmath10 m was then used to remove most non - agn from the survey and provide a candidate list of 786 objects for which optical and/or near - infrared spectroscopy was obtained . of these , 672",
    "were confirmed spectroscopically as agn or quasars .",
    "the remainder either showed no firm evidence for an agn in their spectra , had featureless spectra , or had spectra with only a single weak emission line . in this , the second paper in the series , we compare the fractions of obscured and unobscured quasars in this survey , derive the luminosity functions of the different agn types , and compare to agn surveys in other wavebands .",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we used the optical through near - infrared photometric data tabulated in table 2 of paper i , combined with 12@xmath10 m flux densities from the _ wide field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) _",
    "( wright et al .  2010 ) .",
    "the 12@xmath10 m flux densities were particularly useful for constraining the mid - infrared seds of the agn between the _ spitzer _",
    "8@xmath10 m and 24@xmath10 m bands .",
    "we matched the objects in paper i to the _ wise _ all - sky survey using a @xmath23 match radius , recovering matches to 896 out of 963 ( 93% ) of objects .",
    "( some of those not matched had faint detections in wise 12@xmath10 m from which we could estimate flux densities . )",
    "these data were used as the basis of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fits described in the appendix .",
    "figure 1 shows the redshift - luminosity plane for our survey .",
    "the rest - frame 5@xmath10 m luminosity , @xmath24 was calculated by fitting the spectral energy distribution of each object with either a pure type-1 agn model , or a combination of an agn and a host stellar population , as detailed in the appendix .",
    "the presence of infrared emission from the host galaxy may lead to some subtle selection effects , which are also discussed further in the appendix , though we do not believe they have a significant effect on our derived luminosity function , at least at @xmath25 .",
    "the rest - frame 5@xmath10 m luminosity of the agn ( without a stellar host contribution ) was then used to calculate @xmath24 .",
    "the 14 samples from which the survey was drawn , with their differing 24@xmath10 m flux density limits and areas , account for the relatively wide luminosity range at a given redshift ( a factor of @xmath26 ) , in all but the highest redshift bins . for the analysis presented in this paper , we use the `` statistical sample '' of paper i , which comprises the 662 objects in a 90% spectroscopically - complete subsample of the entire survey ( 479 of which are confirmed agn ) .",
    "the `` statistical sample '' was defined by exploiting the close correlation of @xmath27 and emission line flux density .",
    "objects in each of the 14 samples were sorted in order of decreasing @xmath27 .",
    "the value of @xmath27 at which the survey completeness fell below 90% was then noted , and objects with @xmath27 brighter than this included in the `` statistical sample '' .",
    "this procedure prevents the samples becoming too biassed towards objects which are easy to obtain spectra for ( e.g.   normal type-1 quasars ) .",
    "as described in paper i , we classify our agn as normal , blue type-1 agn , red type-1 agn ( dust reddened , but still showing broad lines in the rest - frame optical , i.e.  with @xmath28 towards the agn ) , type-2 agn ( showing narrow lines only , even in the rest - frame optical , and thus with @xmath29 towards the agn ) , non - agn ( selected as agn candidates but showing no signs of agn activity in their optical spectra ) , stars , and objects with featureless spectra .",
    "our statistical sample consists of 122 normal type-1 agn , 86 red type-1 s and 271 type-2 s , 118 non - agn , 23 stars and 42 with featureless spectra .",
    "we performed maximum likelihood fits both to the luminosity functions of the agn population as a whole , and to the individual luminosity functions for the normal ( blue ) type-1s , type-2s and red type-1s . from an initial @xmath30 estimate of the luminosity function , we noted that , although a power - law provided a visually reasonable fit to the data , there was a small , but significant flattening at low luminosities , consistent with the luminosity function being a broken power - law undergoing luminosity evolution ( although our data do not probe below the break at @xmath31 , so the faint - end evolution is unconstrained at high redshifts ) .",
    "we therefore fit a double power - law function of the form : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the comoving space density of agn , @xmath34 is the characteristic space density , both in units of comoving mpc@xmath35 , @xmath36 is the rest - frame luminosity at 5@xmath10 m and @xmath37 is the break luminosity at 5@xmath10 m , both in units of @xmath38 . the evolution in @xmath37 is the usual cubic expression ( e.g.  h07 ) : @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 is a free parameter in the fit , corresponding to the break luminosity at redshift zero , @xmath42 is the faint - end slope and @xmath43 is fixed at @xmath44 .",
    "we also fit a model with a fixed faint - end by setting @xmath45 in the left - hand term in the denominator of equation 1 and allowing the bright - end slope , @xmath46 to vary as @xmath47    to perform the actual fits , we evaluated the log - likelihood function , @xmath48 , in the usual way ( marshall et al .  1983 ) , by minimizing @xmath49 ( using the powell minimization routine from the scipy.optimize library ) : @xmath50 +   2 \\sum_{j=1,n_f } \\int_{l_{\\rm min}}^{l_{\\rm max } } \\int \\phi(l , z ) a_j \\frac{{\\rm d}v}{{\\rm d}z}{\\rm d}z { \\rm d}l\\ ] ] where the first term sums over the @xmath51 agn being considered , and the second sums over the @xmath52 samples , each of area @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 is the minimum luminosity detectable at redshift @xmath55 in a given sample , and @xmath56 the maximum luminosity ( for samples where there is an upper flux density limit ) .",
    "for the k - corrections in this calculation , mean [ 5.8]-[8.0 ] and [ 8.0]-[24 ] spectral indices for each agn type were measured and applied as appropriate to the agn type and the redshift range of the calculation .",
    "the fitting was performed by optimizing the parameters @xmath42 , @xmath46 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 for agn with @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "we fit all three agn types separately ( normal type-1s , type-2s and red type-1s ) .",
    "we also fit the type-2s and red type-1s together to give a luminosity function for the total obscured population . in order to assess the possible effects of incompleteness , we fit to a set including the objects classified optically as non - agn ( some fraction of which are , in fact , agn , see paper i ) and also containing the featureless spectrum objects which have no redshifts , distributed evenly in comoving volume between @xmath64 , and refer to this as the `` maximal '' fit .",
    "the best - fit parameters are given in table 1 .",
    "for the purposes of comparison with previous work , we also fit a pure power law of the form @xmath65)^{\\gamma_2}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is allowed to vary according to equation 3 .    to determine whether the luminosity evolution model of equation 1 was a better fit than the fixed faint - end slope model , or the pure power - law model of equation 5 , we examined the likelihood ratio of the fits . for two fits giving values of @xmath66 and @xmath67 using models with @xmath68 and @xmath69 degrees of freedom , respectively , @xmath70",
    "is distributed as a @xmath71 distribution with @xmath72 degrees of freedom ( e.g.  freeman et al .",
    "1998 ) . on this basis , the fixed faint - end slope model is slightly , but not significantly worse than the luminosity evolution model ( @xmath73 , with one degree of freedom ) .",
    "the smallness of this difference is perhaps to be expected given the poor constraints on the faint end and its evolution . @xmath74 for the pure power - law versus the broken power law model is 30 ( table 1 ) , and the difference in degrees of freedom is only one , so the broken power - law is formally a much better fit .    to make the binned estimates , we binned the data in five redshift bins ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) assigning a minimum luminosity to each bin at which the bin was approximately complete ( unshaded region in figure 1 ) .",
    "the lower redshift limit was chosen to avoid @xmath80 , where the lacy et al .",
    "( 2004 ) agn selection can be confused by the 6.2@xmath10 m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission .",
    "the bin spacing is in intervals of @xmath81 .",
    "the values of the binned estimates were obtained using the formalism of hasinger , miyaji & schmidt ( 2005 ) , where the fitted luminosity function of equation ( 1 ) is used to predict the number of sources in each bin , @xmath82 by integrating the luminosity function over the luminosity and redshift ranges for each bin for each individual field in the survey , properly accounting for the upper and lower flux limits in each field .",
    "the value of the luminosity function at the bin centre , @xmath83 , is then corrected by the ratio of the number of predicted sources in the bin to the actual number observed , @xmath84 - i.e. : @xmath85 although this has the disadvantage of making the binned estimated somewhat model dependent , the advantage of this technique is that it compensates both for the tendency of objects to be found close to the bottom of a luminosity bin , and at the higher redshift end of redshift bins where the luminosity function is increasing rapidly with redshift ( i.e.  at @xmath86 ) .",
    ".best fitting luminosity function parameters [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      figure [ fig : type_evln ] shows the evolution of the mid - infrared agn population split up by type .",
    "the top two panels , ( a ) and ( b ) , show the luminosity functions at mean redshifts of 0.65 and 1.25 , respectively , for the different types of agn , with the plotted points showing the binned estimates .",
    "the black dotted line indicates the fit for all confirmed agn , with the cyan line that for the maximal model .",
    "compared to the type-1 luminosity functions ( shown in blue and red , for normal and red type-1s , respectively ) , the type-2 luminosity function ( green ) has a much steeper faint - end slope . in the lower two panels , ( c ) and ( d )",
    ", the number density of agn above luminosities of @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively , are plotted against redshift .",
    "up to @xmath89 all the populations shown ( all agn , blue and red type-1s , type-2s and the combination of red type-1s and type-2s , representing the obscured population ) show a similar evolution . the blue type-1 population shows the same evolution as optically - selected quasars , with a peak in number density at @xmath90 , but the obscured quasar population ( magenta line in panel ( d ) ) shows a peak in number density that is broader and shifted to earlier epochs ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "this is consistent with some theoretical predictions ( fanidakis et al .",
    "2012 ) , results from studies of the radio galaxy population ( jarvis et al .",
    "2001 ) , and a study of the infrared luminosity function of quasars from the sloan digital sky survey ( vardanyan , weedman & sargsyan 2014 ) .",
    "our models are fairly poorly constrained beyond the peak , however , with only 13 objects of any type at @xmath92 , so the reality of the difference at high redshifts may be affected by small number statistics .",
    "nevertheless , we have performed some tests to investigate whether the difference in the evolution we see might be statistically significant .",
    "we take for a null hypothesis that the evolution of obscured agn ( type-2 and red type-1s ) and the unobscured ( type-1 ) population is the same .",
    "we then compare the @xmath93 values for fits which fix the evolution of the obscured population to that of the unobscured one , and vice - versa .",
    "fixing the values of the evolution parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the obscured population to those fit for the unobscured population , and allowing the remainder of the parameters to be fit results in a difference in the @xmath93 values of 17 , which , with the three degrees of freedom from fixing the @xmath94 parameter values allows us to eliminate the null hypothesis that the evolution is the same at @xmath95% confidence . forcing the evolution terms for the unobscured population to be the same as those for the obscured one results in a less significant @xmath96 , @xmath97% confidence .",
    "we also compared to the evolution of all agn . as expected , fixing the evolution of the obscured agn to match that of all agn resulted in no significant difference , but the difference from forcing the type-1 evolution to match that of all agn resulted in ruling out the null hypothesis at the 95% confidence level .    in summary",
    ", we find that the evolution of the obscured and unobscured agn populations are significantly different , at @xmath95% confidence using our strongest statistical test . the most obvious difference in the luminosity function evolution is at high redshifts , where the number density of high luminosity obscured quasars appears to peak at a higher redshift than that of the unobscured population .",
    "small number statistics , however , mean this interpretation should be treated with caution .",
    "figure [ fig : type_hist ] shows histograms of number of objects as a function of redshift and luminosity , split up by type .",
    "figure [ fig : obsc_frac ] plots the fraction of obscured objects as a function of both luminosity and redshift with the measured points plotted with error bars and the luminosity function models plotted as dashed lines .",
    "these plots show that the fraction of obscured objects varies from @xmath98% for seyfert galaxies to @xmath1% at the highest quasar luminosities .",
    "in addition , there is evidence that the nature of the obscuration in the survey seems to change as a function of redshift and/or luminosity . at low luminosities and redshifts , most of the obscured objects",
    "are highly obscured , type-2 , objects , but at high luminosities and redshifts the obscured population is dominated by less obscured red type-1 objects .",
    "the right - hand panel suggests that , despite the change in the nature of the obscuration , the overall obscured fraction is not a strong function of redshift when comparing bins at @xmath99 and @xmath100 , and indeed , as discussed in section 2.6 below , it is not until @xmath101 that we see a possible difference .",
    "of course selection effects may well be playing a role here as heavily obscured objects become progressively harder to identify at high redshifts even in samples selected in the mid - infrared . as we discuss in paper i , however , we believe such selection effects are not having a severe effect on our sample , even at @xmath91 .",
    "figure [ fig : bh_density ] shows the agn bolometric luminosity density and corresponding accreted black hole mass density since @xmath102 .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the luminosity density as a function of redshift , with dusty type-1 objects dominating at high redshifts , normal type-1s at @xmath103 and type-2 objects at @xmath104 .",
    "as our best fit luminosity evolution model has a steep faint - end slope , we need to assume a low luminosity cutoff at high luminosities in order to prevent an excessive amount of agn luminosity density from being estimated .",
    "we assume , as a fiducial model , that the fitted form of the luminosity function we have adopted can be extrapolated a factor of three below the current limit of the survey .",
    "this results in luminosity densities in line with those we obtain from our alternative fixed faint - end slope model . with this assumption",
    ", we find more agn than previous surveys , and integrating to the present day ( e.g.  martnez - sansigre & taylor 2009 ) indicates a total energy , @xmath105 , emitted by all agn over the history of the universe of @xmath106 , where the lower bound comes from cutting off the faint - end of the luminosity function at the luminosity corresponding to the flux limit of the deepest sample in our survey ( 0.61mjy at 24@xmath10 m ) , and the upper bound from extrapolating the luminosity function to ten times fainter than this limit . to obtain the observed energy density today due to agn , @xmath107",
    ", we need to divide the integrand by @xmath108 ( soltan 1982 ) , resulting in a value of @xmath109 , or a radiation intensity @xmath110 , within the range of @xmath111 estimated from the x - ray background , and suggesting that @xmath112% of the total radiation intensity of the universe is contributed by agn ( elvis et al .",
    "we therefore need a radiative efficiency of accretion , @xmath13 at the high end of previous estimates to match the local mass density in black holes ( @xmath113 , elvis et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ; @xmath114 , martnez - sansigre & taylor 2009 ) ( figure 8 ( b ) , ( c ) ) .",
    "we use the compendium of local black hole mass density estimates of graham & driver ( 2007 ) , with a mean of @xmath115 to estimate a best fit value of @xmath116 .    as a function of cosmic time",
    ", the evolution of the black hole mass density shows a very rapid rise with at @xmath91 , then continues to rise , but at a smaller rate . fifty percent of the current mass density has accreted by @xmath117 . at @xmath91 , we predict that most black hole mass accretion occurs in dusty type-1 agn , this switches to normal type-1 quasars at @xmath103 , and to type-2 agn at @xmath104 when powerful quasars become very rare .",
    "( 600,180 )",
    "we present evidence that , when largely free from the effects of dust obscuration , the agn luminosity function for actively - accreting black holes seems to be well represented by a double power - law with a break that is a strong function of luminosity , though the form of the faint end remains unconstrained at @xmath118 .",
    "downsizing , in the sense that the characteristic agn luminosity at which most of the agn luminosity density is contributed is a strongly increasing function of redshift , is clearly present at @xmath86 .",
    "luminosity functions are often difficult to interpret in terms of physical models ; however , at low luminosities , we know that most local agn are not triggered by major merger events ( e.g.  kocevski et al",
    ".  2012 ) . at high luminosities , especially in the obscured population , major mergers",
    "may indeed play the dominant role ( e.g.  urrutia et al .",
    "2008 ; treister et al .",
    "2012 ; hopkins , kocevski & bundy 2013 ) .",
    "we therefore speculate that the increase in the break luminosity with redshift is driven by the increased frequency of major mergers of gas - rich galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "a comparison of the mid - infrared luminosity function with those from other wavelengths indicates that we are seeing many more dust - obscured agn than the normal type-1 agn population , and more than the hard x - ray population , particularly at high redshifts .",
    "we find that the evolution of the obscured and the unobscured agn population are significantly different , and we see tentative evidence for an earlier peak in the space density of obscured quasars , consistent with that seen in the radio - loud population .",
    "our study then is consistent with the evolutionary explanation for obscured agn , whereby agn begin heavily obscured and outflows clear out material from the line of sight to the agn .",
    "our new luminosity function has allowed us to improve the constraints on the luminosity density produced by agn , and on the integral of this over cosmic time .",
    "our overall agn luminosity density agrees well with the range predicted from the x - ray background ( elvis et al .",
    "2002 ) , suggesting that we have indeed accounted for the vast majority of agn in the universe , and that about 12% of the luminosity density of the universe is contributed by agn .",
    "when compared to the mass density in compact central objects in galaxies today , this luminosity density allows an estimate of the mean radiative efficiency of accretion onto them .",
    "this number constitutes one of the best constraints we have on the nature of the compact central objects in galaxies .",
    "although it is usually assumed that these are black holes , there are some theoretical alternatives , such as gravastars , that can deliver comparable radiative efficiencies ( harko , kovcs & lobo 2009 ) .",
    "however , it seems likely that the radiative efficiencies of such objects are @xmath119 ( bambi 2012 ) , comparable to the current limit from the x - ray background ( elvis et al .",
    "2002 ) , but below our best estimate of @xmath120 .",
    "significant systematic uncertainties remain , however .",
    "agn missing from our survey , because they are not confirmable in other wavebands ( such as the `` non - agn '' objects in this paper ) or are missing from the mid - infrared selection criteria ( such as low luminosity agn ) will only serve to increase our estimate of the radiative efficiency .",
    "however , there remain uncertainties on the local black hole mass density , the appropriate bolometric corrections to apply to both obscured and unobscured objects , and the low luminosity end of the luminosity function at high redshifts that could result in either an increase or a lowering of our estimate for @xmath13 .",
    "the bolometric correction uncertainty can be addressed by using a full multiwavelength dataset , including archival herschel data , to obtain accurate template seds for the obscured agn population .",
    "improved depth can be obtained by using more sophisticated agn selection techniques based on the complete infrared sed to exploit the full depth of swire to select agn up to four times fainter than the current limit , and photometric redshifts based on new deep near - infrared surveys in the swire fields ( servs , mauduit et al .",

    "( 2006 ) ( with an smc reddening law applied in the case of the dusty red quasars , and a host galaxy stellar population added in a few low luminosity objects ) .",
    "these appear to work fairly well , apart from the 1 - 5@xmath10 m region where the agn sed is known to vary as a function of luminosity ( e.g.  gallagher et al .",
    "2007 ) . for type-2s",
    ", we used the mid - infrared agn template of sajina et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , and a host galaxy stellar population , modeled as a single stellar population from bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) with an age of 0.1,0.64 , 1.4 or 5 gyr picked to best fit the optical sed .",
    "0.64 gyr was used as the default in cases where the optical / near - ir data were too sparse to distinguish between models ( the vast majority of cases ) , however , 21 were fit with with a 1.4gyr population , 23 with a 100myr population , and ten with a 5gyr population .",
    "all the stellar population models had similar behavior in the near - infrared region of the spectrum , however , so the exact choice of stellar age does not affect the agn flux density at rest - frame 5@xmath10 m by more than a few percent .",
    "examples of our fits are shown in figure 9 .",
    "full sed fits through the far - infrared will be discussed in detail in a future paper .",
    "the sed fitting highlights some ways in which our sample may be subject to subtle selection effects due to the prescence of mid - infrared emission from the host galaxy , particularly at low luminosities and redshifts .",
    "our use of flux limits at 24@xmath10 m ensures that photospheric emission from stars contibutes negligibly ( @xmath121% ) to the flux density at the selection frequency .",
    "however , there is the potential for some objects at low redshifts to have their 24@xmath10 m flux densities boosted by emission from warm dust due to star formation .",
    "although this will not contribute significantly to the agn flux density estimated at 5@xmath10 m , it may lead to objects being included in the sample that would otherwise have fallen below the flux density limit at 24@xmath10 m .",
    "however , these same objects are , to a greater extent , selected against in the survey as their 7.7@xmath10 m pah features will lift them out of the agn selection region at @xmath122 ( section 2.5 ) .",
    "as the slope of the warm dust sed is very steep at wavelengths between @xmath123 m and 24@xmath10 m , the contribution of warm dust emission to the observed 24@xmath10 m flux density at higher redshifts is likely to be less than a few percent ."
