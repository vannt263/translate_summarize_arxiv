    "chemical evolution of the universe has been one of the major issues in the modern astronomy .",
    "heavy elements , or metals , have been generated and accumulated in the universe since its birth mainly through supernovae . an important clue to understand the chemical evolution of the universe",
    "will no doubt be brought about by systematic study of a well - defined sample of supernova remnants . in x - ray observations , we are able to extract information of plasma temperature , metal abundance , explosion energy , ionization age , and so on from optically thin thermal plasma emission from supernova remnants ( snrs )",
    ". these pieces of information will lead to understand galactic chemical evolution and star formation history .",
    "a systematic study of snrs in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) suits well for this purpose , because of its well - known distance ( 50kpc ; @xcite ) and small interstellar absorption to lmc .",
    "the fact that lmc is face - on to us is another advantage . because of these characteristics",
    ", systematic x - ray studies of the thermal snrs in lmc have been carried out with some major x - ray observatories ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these observations are , however , limited in terms of energy resolution in the low energy band below @xmath01  kev , which is important to study the nature of the snr plasma in detail , because the temperature of the plasma in most snrs is less than @xmath02  kev .",
    "in particular , hydrogenic and he - like oxygen lines that appear in 0.50.7  kev dominate a spectrum of the plasma with a temperature of @xmath61  kev , and hence , high resolution spectroscopy in this energy band is of great importance in evaluating the parameters of the low temperature plasma , such as the temperature , the density , the ionization parameter and the abundances of the metal .",
    "we therefore have decided to perform a systematic study of the snrs in lmc with the suzaku xis ( @xcite , @xcite ) , which has the best energy resolution in the oxygen 0.50.7  kev energy band among the ccds currently in orbit . in this paper",
    ", we study the snr n23 , as a beginning of our systematic study project .    n23 is identified as a snr with radio observations at 5 and 14.7  ghz for the first time ( @xcite ) .",
    "its x - ray emission extends @xmath7 in the sky ( @xmath8pc at a distance of 50  kpc ) , showing a semi - circular morphology with only the south - eastern hemisphere being bright @xcite .",
    "based on the observation , @xcite classified n23 as a young snr with an age of @xmath9 from the spectrum of the entire remnant .",
    "@xcite carried out spatially resolved spectroscopy of n23 with , and estimated the age of north - western rim to be @xmath04600  yr .",
    "these observations result in consistent estimation of the temperature and the ionization parameter ( @xmath10 ) in the bright south - eastern shell , which is @xmath00.50.7  kev and @xmath11@xmath12 , respectively .",
    "they are , however , not be able to resolve hydrogenic and he - like lines from oxygen clearly because of limited energy resolution below @xmath01  kev .",
    "in addition , @xcite have revealed that there is a point source around the center of n23 . from its 0.510  kev flux ( @xmath13 ) and",
    "power - law spectrum with a photon index of 2.2 , the source is probably a rotation - powered pulsar and/or a pulsar wind nebula .",
    "if so , the progenitor of n23 is a core - collapsed massive star ( @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . after describing how the observation and data reduction are carried out in   [ sec : obs ] , we report the results of spectral analysis of n23 in   [ sec : spec_ana ] .",
    "owing to high spectral resolution of the xis in the oxygen band , we have clearly resolved hydrogenic and he - like k@xmath14 emission lines from oxygen for the first time , which leads to identification of a new low temperature component .",
    "based on these results , we discuss the plasma parameters and evolutionary phase of n23 in   [ sec : dis ] . finally , the summary is given in ",
    "[ sec : sum ] .",
    "n23 was observed with @xcite on 2005 august 1617 .",
    "the observation log is summarized in table  [ tab : suzakuobslog ] .    .observation log . [ cols= \" <",
    ", < , < \" , ]     using eq .",
    "( [ eq : sedovage ] ) with @xmath15  pc , @xmath16 estimated from the low and high temperature components becomes @xmath08000 and @xmath05000  yr , respectively , which are consistent with the lower limit of @xmath17 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sedovage ] ) , implying @xmath16 being proportional to @xmath18 .",
    "the high temperature component is younger than the low temperature component . in the sedov scheme , this can be interpreted as the high temperature component being heated recently . on the other hands , @xmath19 of the low and high temperature components are 9300@xmath20 and 12000@xmath20 , respectively , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : coolage ] ) with @xmath21 given in table  [ tab : n23phi ] (  [ sec : n23_phys ] ) . since @xmath22 for both components , n23 is likely to be at a late stage of the sedov phase , and if so , its age is @xmath08000  yrs old from the newly discovered low temperature component .",
    "note , however , that this discussion depends on the estimation of the volume filling factor @xmath23 .",
    "accounting for the highly anisotropic image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n23image ] ) , we have normalized @xmath23 by 0.1 .",
    "however , if the shock wave of n23 propagates in a higher density ism , like the edge of the open cluster hs  114 @xcite , the total volume should be smaller for the given emission measure , resulting in a smaller @xmath23 .",
    "if , for instance , @xmath24 , @xmath25 of the low and high temperature components are @xmath05000 and @xmath07000  yr , respectively . since @xmath26 , the low temperature component should be regarded as in the radiative phase .",
    "in addition , we would also like to remark that , in   [ sec : n23_phys ] , we have calculated the plasma volume , assuming that the shell thickness is 1/12 of the shell radius , which is expected for a spherical strong shock .",
    "this holds only if n23 is still in the sedov ( adiabatic ) phase .",
    "if n23 has been in the radiative phase , then the shell thickness should be smaller due to radiative cooling , and hence , the plasma density would be larger than the current estimation . as a result , the cooling time scale estimated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : coolage ] ) should be smaller , and @xmath27 .",
    "consequently , we can not deny possibility that n23 has been in the radiative phase .    in summary",
    ", the age of n23 is estimated to be @xmath08000 yr from the newly discovered low temperature component as long as it still stays in sedov phase .",
    "this condition is , however , uncertain , because the discussion depends on the volume filling factor of the plasma .",
    "if , for instance , the shock propagate in the higher density ism , n23 may have already entered into the radiative cooling phase . in this case , the remnant age estimated from the cooling timescale is smaller .",
    "finally , we can make an independent age estimation from the central source detected by @xcite .",
    "its luminosity is @xmath28  erg in the 0.510.0  kev @xcite .",
    "if the central source is a pulsar ( although the pulsation has not been detected ) , the characteristic age is @xmath29@xmath30  years , which is consistent with our age estimation update .",
    "the main component of x - ray emission originates from the swept - up ism in n23 .",
    "hence the elemental abundances of n23 reflect those of its environment .",
    "figure  [ fig : ab ] shows the abundances obtained from the spectral analysis ( table  [ tab : n23bestfitpar ] ) .",

    "/ figure4.eps    the abundances of n , o , ne and fe agree roughly with the lmc average @xcite .",
    "the si and mg abundances are smaller than those obtained ( @xcite ) , although their errors are relatively large .",
    "the mg and si abundances obtained by suzaku are consistent with those from asca ( @xcite ) , respectively , which seem slightly less than the lmc average .",
    "we observed n23 in the large magellanic cloud with suzaku , and discovered the new soft emission component with a temperature of @xmath31  kev , in addition to the @xmath320.7  kev component so far known .",
    "this alters the estimate of the ionization parameter ( @xmath33 ) significantly from @xmath34 to @xmath35 . with the aid of imaging capability , we are able to calculate the density of the plasma , and have confirmed that the supernova explosion of n23 occurred in a high density region with an ism density of @xmath048  @xmath3 .",
    "the relatively high ambient density may be related to the open cluster hs 114 @xcite near the remnant @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the plasma from our analysis indicate that n23 is either at a late stage of the sedov phase or in the radiative cooling phase . assuming it is still in the sedov phase , we have estimated the age of the remnant to be @xmath08000  yr from the newly discovered soft component , which is twice as old as the estimation by @xcite .",
    "given the uncertainty of the volume filling factor , however , we can not deny the possibility that n23 has already entered into the radiative phase .",
