    "in the last years , the availability of single crystal organic field - effect ( ofet ) transistors has represented a step forward in the field of plastic electronics since these systems show a charge mobility at least one order of magnitude larger than that of thin films .",
    "@xcite among them , the most promising and studied are those based on oligoacenes , such as pentacene and rubrene .",
    "@xcite    although the transport properties in the linear regime have been carefully extracted by studying clean single crystal ofet devices , the intrinsic transport mechanism acting in organic semiconductors ( os ) is , up to now , not fully understood . typically , in these materials , the induced doping is not very high ( typically much smaller than one charge carrier for ten molecules ) , so that the mobility is analyzed in transport measurements . at temperatures close or higher than @xmath2 ,",
    "the mobility @xmath3 of these systems exhibits a power - law behavior ( @xmath4 , with @xmath5 ) , @xcite which can not be simply ascribed to band transport .",
    "@xcite moreover , in some systems , starting from room temperature , there is a crossover from band - like to activated hopping behavior .",
    "@xcite for example , in naphthalene and anthracene , along the @xmath6 and @xmath7 axis , there is a change in the temperature behavior of mobility , and , along the @xmath8 axis , an activated regime takes place with a small activated gap of the order of @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite moreover , in pentacene , above room temperature , the mobility shows an upturn with increasing temperature .",
    "@xcite    recently , many photoemission experiments have been performed in pentacene and rubrene .",
    "@xcite the quasi - particle energy dispersion does not exhibit a strong mass renormalization indicating moderate values of electron - phonon ( el - ph ) coupling .",
    "for pentacene , the band structure is reduced only by about @xmath10 going from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "typically , the crossover from tunneling to hopping behavior observed in transport properties is ascribed to the formation of local polarons , @xcite and described with the simplest model for molecular crystals , the holstein model .",
    "@xcite the modeling assumes that the most relevant carrier interaction is with local modes whose frequency is lower than the typical hopping energy .",
    "@xcite the used approaches only generalize the previous treatment of holstein works , @xcite starting from the questionable limit of narrow electronic band even for the coupling to low - frequency modes . actually , recent results , based on the adiabatic approach for the vibrational modes , have pointed out that , up to room temperature , within a parameter range valid for many oligoacenes , polaronic effects do not play a prominent role if low frequency modes are excited in the holstein model .",
    "@xcite    recent _ ab - initio _ calculations have evidenced that charge carriers are mostly coupled to intra - molecular modes with high frequency .",
    "moreover , it has been found that another very relevant interaction is with inter - molecular modes with low frequency in comparison with typical electron hoppings .",
    "@xcite another important result is that the reorganization energy ( related to the polaron binding energy ) decreases with increasing the number of benzene rings in oligoacenes ( for example , going from naphthalene to pentacene ) .    in view of",
    "_ ab - initio _ results ,",

    "@xcite one - dimensional models similar to su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) model @xcite have been introduced to study the os along the relevant stack direction .",
    "@xcite these models treat the inter - molecular modes as classical exploiting their low energy in comparison with the electronic hopping scale .",
    "the approaches are non perturbative in the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the mobility is quite well described at low temperatures showing a robust power - law @xmath0 .",
    "however , the power - law behavior extends up to high @xmath13 and there is no sign of upturn in the mobility as function of temperature .",
    "aim of this work is to clarify the effects of electron coupling to intra- and inter - molecular vibrational modes on the transport properties of prototype single crystal os , such as oligoacenes .",
    "to this aim , a one - dimensional model with coupling to intra- and inter - molecular modes has been analyzed .",
    "we will show that the interplay between local and non local el - ph interactions is able to provide a very accurate description of the mobility and to shed light on the intricate mechanism of band narrowing with increasing temperature .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional model with coupling to intra- and inter - molecular modes similar to one recently introduced , where the treatment only concerns the study of spectral properties .",

    "actually , we generate a sequence of random numbers distributed according to @xmath109 . for the systems investigated in this paper , a few thousands of iterations are sufficient to get a good accuracy even for dynamic quantities .",
    "the method exposed above is very accurate in the regime @xmath110 and @xmath63 appropriate to os .",

    "@xmath40 , a coherent behavior is present with a power - law of the order of @xmath114 at low temperature . as expected , with increasing @xmath40 , there is a crossover from tunneling to hopping behavior due to the formation of localized small polarons .",
    "that occurs at temperatures slightly larger than @xmath115 for @xmath116 . for large values of @xmath40 ,",
    "the low temperature power - law part is strongly reduced and the activated behavior is followed by the residual scattering regime at very high @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite    in the variational approach , the crossover from band - like to hopping regime is marked by the value @xmath117 on all the sites .",
    "however , in the intermediate regime ( for example @xmath116 ) , at temperatures characterized by a metallic behavior , the calculation provides values of @xmath118 smaller than unity ( @xmath118 of the order of @xmath119 ) suggesting that the tunneling regime is reduced but still present .",

    ", we report the density of states at @xmath112 for the same values of @xmath40 of the main figure .",
    "as expected , with increasing @xmath40 , there is a reduction of the fundamental polaronic band with a transfer of spectral weight to high satellite bands appearing at multiples of the vibrational frequency @xmath122 .",
    "@xcite     and @xmath116.,scaledwidth=55.0% ]    the description of mobility based only on the intra - molecular mode electron coupling fails for two reasons in the comparison with low temperature experiments .",
    "first , it does not provide large values of the mobility ( expressed in our natural units , that is in terms of @xmath123 , taking @xmath124 @xcite ) .",
    "for example , at @xmath125 ( room temperature ) , @xmath126 is less than @xmath127 for @xmath116 .",
    "then , the low temperature mobility due local coupling scales as @xmath114 .",
    "the next step is to combine the effects of high frequency local vibrational modes with non local low frequency ones .",
    "these non local modes are considered as relevant for the description of the mobility up to room temperature . actually ,",
    "for rubrene , the carrier mobility is dominated by inter - molecular phonons ( the non local coupling is estimated to be in the intermediate regime @xmath128 ) since the interaction with the intra - molecular modes is almost negligible ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "@xcite in pentacene , the coupling with local modes is of the same order of that in rubrene .",
    "@xcite for these materials , our approach , being the local el - ph coupling perturbative , predicts a slight reduction of mobility in agreement with results present in the literature .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , going from pentacene to naphthalene , the reorganization energy nearly increases twice suggesting a much stronger coupling with local modes .",
    "@xcite therefore , for systems with reduced number of benzene rings like naphthalene , we expect a larger interplay between intra- and inter - molecular modes within the intermediate el - ph coupling regime for both modes .    in fig .",
    "2 , we report the density of states @xmath111 for @xmath116 and @xmath130 at different temperatures . at @xmath112 , where the effect of non local modes is weak , the lowest band",
    "is strongly renormalized at lower energies and becomes narrower ( about half of the bare band ) .",
    "the intrisic reduction of the bare band provides a simple and direct explanation of the difference in the bandwidth evidenced in the series of oligoacenes from naphthalene ( effective band of the order of @xmath131 ) to pentacene ( effective band of the order of @xmath132 ) .",
    "indeed , it can be ascribed to the decrease of the reorganization energy that in turn reduces the renormalization effects .",
    "@xcite    . for comparison ,",
    "the behavior with @xmath133 is shown.,scaledwidth=55.0% ]    at finite temperature , the shape of the spectra is changed due to the non local coupling .",
    "actually , any band shows a new small maximum due to the coupling to inter - molecular modes .",
    "moreover , the band narrowing is strongly reduced in the presence of non local coupling . in order to clarify this point",
    ", we notice that , for @xmath113 , the principal band at @xmath134 is reduced of about @xmath135 of the band at @xmath112 . on the other hand , for @xmath130 ,",
    "the principal band at @xmath134 is reduced of only @xmath136 of the band at @xmath112 .",
    "the narrowing of the principal band results from a subtle equilibrium between the two opposite tendencies . actually , the coupling to non local modes has the main effect to induce scattering into the single bands of the density of states , preventing the narrowing induced by the coupling to local modes .",
    "the interplay between local and non local modes is able to produce a modest narrowing as function of the temperature even if the coupling to local modes is not weak .",
    "our prediction is that this effect should be present not only in pentacene , @xcite but also in naphthalene and anthracene .",
    "finally , we analyze the mobility in the intermediate regime ( see fig .",
    "as shown in the previous section , the mobility can be divided into two contributions @xcite : the coherent , where the scattering of the renormalized electron ( the only effect due local el - ph coupling is here the reduction of the bandwidth ) with non local modes is included , and the incoherent one , where , in addition to non local modes , scattering with multiple real local phonons is considered .",
    "the first term , relevant at low temperatures , bears a strong resemblance with the mobility of the system at @xmath137 , even if , as expected , it is smaller .",
    "the incoherent term starts at a temperature of about @xmath138 and becomes predominant at higher temperatures .",
    "actually , the coherent term only decreases with temperature even if the electron dynamics becomes incoherent .",
    "the role of the local coupling is to promote an activated behavior in the incoherent regime .",
    "the cooperative effect is able to provide an activation energy @xmath120 of about @xmath139 , therefore less than one half of that for @xmath113 and close to that extracted by the data in naphthalene .",
    "@xcite moreover , the upturn in the mobility starts at lower temperatures in comparison with the case @xmath113 .",
    "the local coupling is able to affect but to not destroy the low temperature behavior dominated by the non local coupling . in the inset of fig .",
    "3 , we report the low temperature mobility in logarithmic scale .",
    "actually , for @xmath137 , the mobility scales as @xmath140 , while , with increasing @xmath40 , the power - law becomes slightly less pronounced . in the case",
    "@xmath116 , the mobility goes as @xmath141 , still compatible with experiments in naphthalene .",
    "@xcite    in summary , the proposed model is able to capture many features of the mobility in oligoacenes .",
    "first of all , it has the correct order of magnitude : for @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) , @xmath144 , while at @xmath145 ( @xmath146 ) , @xmath147 .",
    "these values compare favorably with mobility measurements in naphthalene : for @xmath142 , @xmath148 in the hole channel and @xmath149 in the electron channel , while at @xmath145 , @xmath150 in the hole channel and @xmath151 in the electron channel .",
    "@xcite at low temperatures , the mobility scales as a power - law @xmath0 with the exponent @xmath152 larger than unity even if an intermediate el - ph coupling to local modes is present .",
    "starting from room temperature , the incoherent contribution of mobility begins increasing . at high temperatures ,",
    "the mobility shows an hopping behavior with a small activation energy .",
    "the theory is intended to describe the mobility in the direction where it has the maximum value .",
    "typically , this corresponds to a direction into the growth plane of the ofet on the substrate .",
    "@xcite the study of mobility in the other in - plane direction and out of plane is out of the aim of this study .",
    "the interplay between local and non local el - ph couplings strongly affects the band narrowing and the mobility as function of the temperature .",
    "the band narrowing has a polaronic origin but it is strongly dependent on the non local el - ph coupling . in the intermediate coupling regime of the electron with both intra- and inter - molecular modes ,",
    "the mobility scales as a power - law @xmath0 at low temperatures , and it is characterized by hopping behavior with a small activation energy at high temperatures .",
    "we believe that the main conclusions will not be qualitatively modified by the inclusion of more realistic lattice structures and interactions since the results rely on general features of different types of el - ph coupling . the next step will be to investigate the effect of traps on the low temperature mobility generalizing the model presented in this work .    99 t. hasegawa and j. takeya , sci .",

    "<S> focus is on spectral and transport properties of these systems beyond perturbative approaches . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay between different couplings strongly affects the temperature band renormalization that is the result of a subtle equilibrium between opposite tendencies : band narrowing due to interaction with local modes , band widening due to electron coupling to non local modes . </S>",
    "<S> the model provides an accurate description of the mobility as function of temperature : indeed , it has the correct order of magnitude , at low temperatures , it scales as a power - law @xmath0 with the exponent @xmath1 larger than unity , and , at high temperatures , shows an hopping behavior with a small activation energy . </S>"
