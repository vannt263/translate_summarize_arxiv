    "exactly solvable models describing interacting bosons in one - dimension ( 1d ) have been studied over decades since the pioneering work of girardeau @xcite , and lieb and liniger @xcite .",
    "the interest in these models is greatly stimulated with recent experiments @xcite , in which ultracold atomic gases are tightly confined in 1d atomic waveguides , such that transverse excitations are suppressed . the lieb - liniger ( ll ) model describes 1d bosons with pointlike contact interactions of a given strength @xmath0 @xcite . in the limit of sufficiently strong interactions , the ll gas enters the tonks - girardeau ( tg ) regime of impenetrable bosons @xcite ; the tg regime can be obtained at very low temperatures , with strong effective interactions , and low linear particle densities @xcite .",
    "an interesting aspect of 1d bose gases , which can be probed experimentally from weakly to the strongly interacting regime , is their behavior out of equilibrium ( e.g. , see ref .",
    "an exact ( analytical or numerical ) theoretical calculation of nonequilibrium dynamics of a ll gas is a complex many - body problem , which was studied in a few cases @xcite .",
    "a paradigmatic problem in this context is one - dimensional free expansion from an initially localized state @xcite .",
    "quite generally , free expansion can be used to provide information on the initial state ( e.g. , see refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "free expansion of a ll gas was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite by using the hydrodynamic approximation @xcite ; it was demonstrated that the evolution of single - particle ( sp ) density is not self - similar for finite interaction strength @xmath0 .",
    "exact solutions of free expansion were studied both in the tg regime ( @xmath1 ) @xcite , and for a repulsive ll gas ( @xmath2 ) @xcite . in the tg regime , it has been shown that the momentum distribution approaches that of noninteracting fermions during free expansion @xcite .",
    "this was shown numerically by using the model of hard - core bosons on the lattice in ref .",
    "@xcite , and by using the stationary phase approximation in the continuous tg model ( for the initial harmonic confinement ) in ref .",
    "@xcite . for quite general initial conditions ,",

    "it was shown that these wave functions vanish at the hyperplanes of contact between particles , which is characteristic for tg wave functions @xcite .",
    "however , it was emphasized that the properties of such asymptotic states can considerably differ from the physical properties of a tonks - girardeau gas in the ground state of some trapping potential @xcite ( see also the second item of ref .",
    "we also point out that expansion dynamics is subject of studies in other 1d models ; for example particles interacting via an inverse - square pair potential @xcite , strongly correlated fermions @xcite , and strongly interacting bose - fermi mixtures @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", studies of the momentum distribution of an expanding ll gas , which are based on exact time - dependent solutions , have not yet been made .",
    "here we numerically study free expansion of a few lieb - liniger bosons , which are initially in the ground state of an infinitely deep hard - wall trap .",
    "the numerical calculation is carried out by employing a standard fourier transform , as follows from the fermi - bose transformation for a time - dependent lieb - liniger gas @xcite .",
    "we focus on dynamics of one - body observables of the system , in particular the momentum distribution , the occupancies of natural orbitals , and also the real - space single - particle density .",
    "our numerical calculation allows us to explore the behavior of these observables in the transient regime of the expansion , where they are non - trivially affected by the particle interactions .",
    "we derive analytically ( by using the stationary phase approximation ) the formula which connects the asymptotic shape of the momentum distribution and the initial state . for sufficiently large times",
    "the momentum distribution coincides ( up to a simple scaling transformation ) with the shape of the real - space single - particle density , reflecting the fact that the expansion is asymptotically ballistic .",
    "the relation between the asymptotic expansion velocity of the ll cloud , and the overall energy stored in the system is derived .",
    "our analytical and numerical results are in good agreement .    before proceeding ,",
    "let us devote a few words to some of the techniques for solving ll and tg models .",
    "the bethe ansatz can be used to find the eigenstates for ll particles on an infinite line @xcite , with periodic boundary conditions @xcite , and in an infinitely deep box @xcite . in the tg limit , both stationary @xcite and time - dependent @xcite wave functions , in an arbitrary external potential , are constructed by using the fermi - bose mapping , i.e. , by solving the schr \" odinger equation for spinless noninteracting fermions , after which the fermionic wave function is properly symmetrized to describe tg bosons @xcite . in a similar fashion , exact time - dependent ll wave functions , in the absence of an external potential and on an infinite line , can be constructed by employing the fermi - bose mapping operator @xcite , which ensures that the so - called cusp - condition ( see e.g. , @xcite ) imposed by the interactions is obeyed during time - evolution . in the light of the recent experiments @xcite , there has been renewed interest in exact studies of ll gases ( stationary @xcite and time - dependent @xcite ) , and time - dependent tg gases @xcite .",
    "even once a wave function describing a ll gas is known , determination of its correlation functions and observables such as the momentum distribution is difficult @xcite .",
    "various methods were developed over the years including the quantum inverse scattering method @xcite , @xmath3 expansions @xcite from the tg @xmath4 regime , and quantum monte carlo integration @xcite . in the tg limit",
    ", momentum distribution can be analytically studied in a few cases ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "numerical calculation of the tg momentum distribution can be performed also for excited and time - dependent states @xcite ; for hard - core bosons on the lattice see @xcite ; a simple formula suitable for numerical calculations was recently derived for the continuous tg model @xcite , and generalized for 1d hard - core anyons @xcite .",

    "the sp density exhibits self - similar ( ballistic ) expansion ( this is not true in the transient period preceding the asymptotic regime , see ref .",

    "@xcite ) , @xmath55 we normalize @xmath56 such that @xmath57 .",
    "the variable @xmath54 has units of velocity ; the self - similar asymptotic sp density can be interpreted as the distribution of velocities of particles in a gas , which is in a simple manner related to the momentum distribution @xmath58 .",

    "free expansion in the tg regime is solved by the fermi - bose mapping @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "the sp density is identical on both sides of the map .",
    "since fermions are noninteracting , the asymptotic form of the sp density ( for both tg bosons and free fermions ) is identical to the fermionic momentum distribution , which does not change in time . equations ( [ mdasym ] ) and ( [ spasym ] ) immediately yield that the asymptotic momentum distribution for tg bosons has the same shape as the asymptotic sp density , which has the shape of the fermionic momentum distribution , i.e. , we obtain the result of refs . @xcite .",

    "in this section we calculate free expansion of three ll bosons , which are initially ( at @xmath22 ) in the ground state in an infinitely deep box of length @xmath60 .",
    "the analytical expression for the ll box ground state has been found in ref .",
    "@xcite . by using this result",
    "it is straightforward to calculate @xmath61 ( which depends on the interaction strength @xmath0 ) for this particular initial condition ; we have outlined this calculation in appendix [ app : init ] for @xmath5 particles .",

    "figure [ contours ] displays contour plots of the probability density @xmath65 for @xmath66 , at two different times , @xmath22 and @xmath67 .",

    "however , this does not necessarily mean that the properties of such an asymptotic state correspond to the properties of a tg gas , which was usually studied in the ground state of some external potential .",
    "for example , suppose that the initial state is a weakly correlated ground state in the box ; despite the fact that , during expansion , the particles get strongly correlated in the close vicinity of the hyperplanes of contact , the absence of correlations in the initial state survives as an overall feature through to the asymptotic state ( see the discussion in ref . @xcite and the second item of ref .",

    "we observe that the occupancy of the leading no , @xmath73 , decreases during time evolution .",
    "however , for the plotted interaction strengths , the decrease of @xmath73 is not too large .",

    "let us calculate the asymptotic expansion velocity as a function of the interaction parameter @xmath0 .",
