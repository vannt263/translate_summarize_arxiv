    "by now , the inflationary universe @xcite is generally recognized to be a likely scenario that leads to the big bang .",
    "so far , its predictions of the flatness and the scale - invariant power spectrum of the density perturbation that seeds structure formations are in good agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "future data will test inflationary predictions to a very high accuracy .",
    "in fact , there is widespread hope that the enormous growth in scale during inflation may provide a kind of planck scale microscope , allowing us one day to probe stringy and/or brane world effects from precision cosmological measurements @xcite .    in conventional inflationary models ,",
    "the physics lies in the inflaton potential .",
    "although there are constraints from observations , such as enough number of e - foldings , the amplitude of the density perturbation etc . , there are very few theoretical constraints on the underlying dynamics of the inflaton field . as a result",
    ", this scalar field potential can take a large variety of shapes . in hybrid inflation",
    "@xcite or other variations , additional fields and/or parameters are introduced , allowing even more freedom .",
    "however , the problem in a conventional 4-dimensional theory is the difficulty of finding an appropriate inflaton potential . in general , a potential that yields the correct magnitude of density perturbation and satisfies the slow - roll condition is not well - motivated and requires some fine - tuning .",
    "generically , such fine - tuning is not preserved by quantum corrections .",
    "recently , motivated by the idea of brane world @xcite , the brane inflationary scenario@xcite was proposed , where the inflaton is identified with an inter - brane separation : @xmath0 .",
    "inflation ends when the branes collide , heating the universe that starts the big bang . in this scenario ,",
    "the inflaton potential has a geometric interpretation .",
    "in particular , higher dimensional gravity ( or more generally , bulk modes or closed string states ) dictates the form of the inflaton potential .",
    "for example , the inflaton potential may simply be the newton s potential between branes .",
    "this visualization of the brane dynamics allows one to implement inflation physics pictorially .",
    "suitable inflaton potentials naturally appear in the brane world scenario , and their forms are robust under quantum corrections . in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate further this unusual feature of brane inflation . if the fundamental string scale is substantially above a few tev , brane inflation will be a valuable testing ground for the brane world scenario .",
    "the motion of the branes is dictated by interbrane ( which can be brane - brane , brane - orientifold or brane - antibrane ) forces . moreover , a velocity - dependent term in the potential is present generically .",
    "so when branes move , this term may become important .",
    "this velocity - dependent term is calculable in string theory ; the precise values of the parameters that appear in this term depend on the details of the model .",
    "in fact , one might expect such a velocity - dependent term from the post - newtonian approximation in higher dimensional gravity . in this paper",
    ", we also examine the impact of such a velocity - dependent force on the slow - roll and the power spectrum of the density perturbation .",
    "we find that the effect on the tilt of the spectral index of the density perturbations may be small .",
    "however , such a term is likely to have an observable effect on the ratio of the tensor to scalar perturbations .",
    "moreover , the scale dependence of the spectral index is also modified .",
    "therefore , a global analysis of data from various measurements may allow us to distinguish these effects from that of the conventional inflationary scenario .",
    "our starting part is the effective action @xmath1 for the canonically normalized inflaton @xmath2 of the form : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the effective potential .",
    "the precise form of @xmath5 will be specified later on .",
    "note that the field @xmath2 in the brane world is related to the separation @xmath6 between the branes by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the string scale . to lowest order @xmath9 .",
    "there are also higher order corrections to @xmath10 . in the usual inflationary scenario ,",
    "the deviation of @xmath11 from unity is due to quantum effects .",
    "typically , it takes the form of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a constant and @xmath14 is the coupling constant . here",
    ", we will consider a different type of contribution to @xmath11 which is motivated by brane world physics ( or higher dimensional gravity ) .    in an expanding universe , @xmath15 , then , @xmath16    for inflation to take place , there is some choice of @xmath2 so that the potential @xmath17 satisfies the slow - roll conditions : latexmath:[\\ ] ] the solution of @xmath171 does not change greatly with the velocity - dependent term , @xmath172 furthermore , @xmath158 and so the velocity - dependent term is also negligible .",
    "therefore , @xmath173 where @xmath136 .",
    "the spectrum is tilted to the red . if the lowest non - vanishing contribution to the potential comes from the dipole of a brane - orientifold plane system , @xmath174 which gives a slightly larger red tilt .",
    "in this paper , we have examined the density perturbation spectrum in the brane inflationary scenario .",
    "we have also studied the effect of a velocity - dependent potential .",
    "the form of the inflation potential as well as the velocity - dependent potential is strongly motivated from higher dimensional gravity ( in particular , string theory ) . in the usual four - dimensional inflationary scenario ,",
    "the deviation of @xmath11 from unity is due to quantum effects and is usually small . in brane inflation , however , the velocity - dependent potential can give rise to a significant effect in @xmath11 .",
    "generically , the effect on the spectral index is comparable with that from the slow - roll parameter @xmath43 ( from eq.([index ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , in models where @xmath43 is not small , this may be a measurable effect . even though this effect on @xmath46 can be small in a generic model",
    ", the scale - dependence of @xmath46 has a stronger dependence on the velocity dependent term , as it scales @xmath175 by a factor of @xmath176 ( see eq .",
    "( [ ktilt ] ) ) .",
    "more importantly , the velocity - dependent potential can also modify the ratio of tensor to scalar fluctuations ( see eq.([t / s ] ) ) . with a global analysis of data from various measurements ,",
    "one should be able to distinguish these effects from those that can be obtained from a conventional inflationary scenario .",
    "we expect that a few percent deviation of @xmath39 from unity may be measurable .",
    "it seems that the power spectrum index in a generic inflationary scenario in the brane world has a red tilt of a few percent .",
    "the velocity dependent potential can further tilt the density perturbation spectrum to the red or to the blue , depending on the specific form of the potential .",
    "the blue tilt due to the velocity - dependent term does not require extra fields , in contrast to other inflationary models ( _ e.g. _ , hybrid inflation ) .",
    "the velocity - dependent potential in the brane flationary scenario is similar to that appears in k - inflation @xcite .",
    "however , unlike k - inflation , in our scenario , inflation is still driven by the static potential .",
    "the additional velocity dependent term provides modifications of the usual slow - roll inflation .",
    "furthermore , the kinetic term and the static potential in the brane inflation scenario are related by string theory or by post - newtonian approximation ( see eq.([postnewton ] ) ) .",
    "potential of the type @xmath177 has been studied in the context of quintessence @xcite .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that this type of potential appear naturally in supersymmetric theory .",
    "as we have described , this type of potential is also motivated when we study cosmology involving branes .",
    "furthermore , the velocity dependent term has a close resemblance to that in k - essence @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to explore whether the specific form of k - essence motivated by brane dynamics may offer an explanation for the present accelerating universe .",
    "the research of g.s . was supported in part by the doe grant fg02 - 95er40893 , the university of pennsylvania school of arts and sciences dean s fund , and the nsf grant phy99 - 07949 .",
    "the research of s .- h.h.t . was partially supported by the national science foundation .",
    "g.s . would like to thank the m - theory workshop at itp , santa barbara , and the theory division at cern for support and hospitality during the final stage of this work .",
    "in this appendix , we derive the equation for the quantum fluctuation @xmath25 in the presence of a non - trivial @xmath11 , and show that at late time , @xmath25 and @xmath26 obey the same differential equation with respect to time .",
    "we used this fact to derive eq.([gpformula ] ) analogous to the original derivation of @xcite .    to study quantum fluctuations , we split @xmath2 into the classical piece @xmath178 ( which satisfies ( [ eom ] ) ) and the quantum piece @xmath25 : @xmath179 the classical piece is homogeneous , whereas the fluctuations satisfy : @xmath180 where we have dropped the subscript @xmath13 for the classical part of @xmath2 .",
    "we note that for scales outside the horizon ( hence the gradient term is negligible ) , @xmath25 and @xmath26 obeys the same time - dependent differential equation . by expanding @xmath25 in fourier modes : @xmath181",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath182 is @xmath183 it is convenient to rewrite it in terms of @xmath184 . in the conventional case , @xmath9 , @xmath185 where prime denotes derivative with respect to conformal time @xmath186 . for de sitter space",
    ", the solution is @xmath187 which reduces to @xmath188 for @xmath189 and @xmath190 for @xmath191 .    in the presence of a velocity - dependent potential , @xmath192 for scales inside the horizon , when the fluctuations are generated",
    ", the dominant term is still @xmath193 .",
    "therefore , @xmath194 is still given by the bunch - davies vacuum , @xmath195 hence the quantum fluctuations @xmath182 is still given by the de sitter temperature , @xmath196                        v.f .",
