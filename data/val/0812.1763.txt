    "i was raised a hardcore c@xmath0-algebraist .",

    "as a fresh phd my knowledge of von neumann algebras was superficial , at best .",
    "i did nt really like von neumann algebras , did nt understand them , and certainly did nt need them to prove theorems .",
    "conversations with new w@xmath0-phds make it clear that this goes both ways ; they often know little about c@xmath0-algebras , and care less .    today i still know relatively little about von neumann algebras , but i have grown to love them . and",
    "they are an indispensable tool in my c@xmath0-research .",
    "conversely , recent work of narutaka ozawa ( some in collaboration with sorin popa ) has shown that c@xmath0-techniques can have deep applications to the structure theory of certain von neumann algebras .",
    "in other words , there are very good reasons for c@xmath0-algebraists and von neumann algebraists to learn something about each other s craft . in the  old \" days ( say 30 or more years ago ) , the previous sentence would have been silly ( indeed , some  old \" timers may still find it silly ) as the field of operator algebras was small enough for students to become well acquainted with most of it . that s no longer the case .",
    "hence , i hope these notes will help my generation , and those that follow , to see the delightfully intertwined theories of c@xmath0- and w@xmath0-algebras as an indivisible unit .",
    "i do not intend to write an encyclopedia of c@xmath0- and w@xmath0-interactions .",
    "amenability ( for groups , actions and operator algebras ) is a perfect context for illustrating some of the most important interactions , so these notes are organized around that theme . also ,",
    "i assume familiarity with basics such as c@xmath0- and w@xmath0-algebras associated to discrete groups , crossed products , and numerous other things . keeping these notes self contained would , i fear , bury the ideas being advertised under a mountain of details .",
    "hence , the reader will frequently be referred to @xcite ( another advertisement , of the shameless sort ) for more details .",
    "* acknowlegment : * these notes are based on lectures given at the summer school on aspects of operator algebras and applications ( palacio de la magdalena , santander ) and the workshop operator algebras , dynamics and classification ( texas a&m ) .",
    "the organizers at both places were amazing and i ca nt thank them enough for their hospitality .",
    "i distinctly remember my first encounter with a w@xmath0-fundamentalist . after a day at gpots , we were at a bar impressing locals with exotic vocabulary .",
    "out of nowhere came the verbal left hook .    ",

    "how hard is that ?",
    "look at all the tools you give yourself : weakly compact unit balls , polar decompositions , you even have a borel functional calculus",

    ";-)    fundamentalism is stupid .",
    "trust me , i know , i m a recovering fundamentalist .",
    "it took me a long time to see that i was guilty of precisely the sort of tribalism that i now wish to discourage .",
    "( and , yes , i occasionally relapse . )",
    "these days when i meet a w@xmath0-fundamentalist , i try to point out what c@xmath0-algebras have done for von neumann algebras .",
    "for example , having complicated representation theory is not a c@xmath0-defect  it s an opportunity . just ask bob powers .",
    "his celebrated construction of non - isomorphic type iii factors ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) depends on the non - triviality of c@xmath0-representation theory . in the latter half of these notes",
    "we ll see more recent examples ; ozawa s work on solid von neumann algebras is largely c@xmath0-algebraic .    for my own part ,",
    "i no longer denigrate the rich structure of von neumann algebras .",
    "i exploit it .",
    "i love the fact that they have projections and ( in the finite case ) tracial states .",
    "i m green with envy over the compactness of their unit balls . for example , how awesome would it be if the following result , which is a fairly simple consequence of alaoglu s theorem , had a c@xmath0-analogue ?    [ subthm : pointultraweak ]",
    "let @xmath1 be a banach space , @xmath2 be a von neumann algebra and @xmath3 be a bounded net of linear maps .",
    "then @xmath4 has a cluster point in the point - ultraweak topology .",
    "do nt see the point ?",
    "well , imagine the theorems you could prove if , for example , every sequence of asymptotically multiplicative u.c.p .",
    "maps @xmath5 had a point - norm convergent subsequence ",
    "i.e. , gave rise to a @xmath6-homomorphism @xmath7 !",
    "( for example , you could prove that all c@xmath0-algebras are type i , a fantastically false result . )",
    "the point i m trying to make is that in a von neumann algebra you can do things we c@xmath0-fundamentalists only dream of doing .",
    "passing to a weak closure and gettin crazy can be a lot of fun  not to mention fruitful .",
    "indeed , when trying to prove a c@xmath0-theorem my first thought is usually this :  how do i translate this problem into a w@xmath0-question ? and",
    "how will i come back ? \" of course , certain c@xmath0-questions are more amenable to this approach than others , but in these notes i ll try to explain some of the ways that von neumann algebras have been used to prove c@xmath0-theorems , and vice versa .",

    "beautiful !",
