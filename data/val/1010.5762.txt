    "a quantum random walk can be considered as a quantum analog of the more familiar classical random walk on a lattice . in this much simpler case",
    "the study of interesting  return properties \" can be said to have started with g. plya ( 1921 ) , @xcite , who proved that the simplest unbiased walk will eventually return to the origin with probability one in dimension not greater than two .",
    "this holds in spite of the fact that the probability of returning to the origin in @xmath0 steps , denoted by @xmath1 , converges to zero as @xmath0 tends to infinity .    in this paper",
    "we consider aspects of this problem in the context of quantum random walks ( qws ) . we give a method that allows us to analyze the asymptotic behaviour of the quantity @xmath1 for two - state one - dimensional qws , leading to the discovery of general features of this asymptotics in the case of distinct coins .",
    "we also apply this method to the qws that are given by one arbitrary common coin at each site except for an arbitrary  defective \" coin at the origin . before giving a summary of the results in the paper we give a brief review of the more standard case of a classical random walk .    in this more traditional case , and for the simplest unbiased walk",
    ", one can obtain an expression for @xmath1 in many different ways .",
    "this is basically true since one is dealing with a translation invariant evolution .",
    "as soon as this condition is relaxed things become much harder .",
    "one of the methods that can ( at least in theory ) give an expression for @xmath1 goes back to the work of s. karlin and j. mcgregor ( 1959 ) , @xcite .",
    "their method applies to a birth - and - death process on the nonnegative integers but they themselves already contemplated extending their method to such processes on the integers by using matrix valued objects .",
    "this has been implemented recently and independently by h. dette et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , @xcite , as well as by f.a .",
    "grnbaum ( 2007 ) , @xcite . in both cases",
    "one makes crucial use of the matrix valued orthogonal polynomials introduced by m.g .",
    "krein ( 1949 ) , @xcite .",
    "the karlin - mcgregor ( kmcg ) method alluded to above proceeds by starting from a very simple case , say a situation with no defects , considering its orthogonality measure and related function theoretical objects such as its stieltjes transform .",
    "one then introduces one defect and studies the effect that this has on the orthogonality measure . in this way one can get an expression for the new value of @xmath1",
    "clearly this process can be iterated a finite number of times to obtain situations that are far from the initial basic case .",
    "the kmcg method proceeds by studying the effect of the defect on the stieltjes transform of the measure and it produces much more than an expression for the new value of @xmath1 . the interested reader can find a host of examples treated in the fashion described above in the papers @xcite .    in a previous paper , @xcite , we found an analog of the kmcg method that can be used in the case of qws on the integers and the non negative integers .",
    "this method has recently been used by other authors , see @xcite .",
    "we use their terminology and call this the cgmv method . in the cgmv method the central role is played by a convenient spectral representation of the unitary operator that describes the dynamics of the walk . in that sense",
    "this is very close in spirit to the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics laid down by people like e. schredinger , w. heisenberg , m. born and j. von neumann .",
    "the connection with qws is embodied in the fact that a unitary operator has a nice five - diagonal representation , see @xcite . while this is true for any unitary operator , the search for such a five - diagonal representation can be a difficult task in the infinite dimensional case . however , for a standard two - state one - dimensional qw the five - diagonal representation comes from an appropriate reordering of the usual basis of states",
    ".    while the method itself is fairly similar to the one used by karlin and mcgregor , the results that one obtains in the quantum case are , regardless of the method , often intrinsically different from the classical ones .",
    "for instance , the application of cgmv tools yields in @xcite a number of situations dealing with the notion of recurrence , where one sees that classical and quantum walks have little in common . some of these differences were previously discovered in @xcite using a fourier approach to quantum recurrence .",
    "it is possible that many more such differences will become apparent as one develops good tools to study these kinds of walks .",
    "for instance , appropriate mathematical techniques such as the fractional moment method , @xcite , have been key to prove for qws with random coins a peculiarity of quantum systems in random environments called  anderson localization \" : the wave packets stay trapped in a finite region of space for all time .",
    "there is a huge literature on this subject that has its origin in a discrete model in solid state physics , see @xcite .",
    "the interested reader may get a guide to the literature as well as very nice discussion of this notion by consulting @xcite . concerning anderson localization in qws see @xcite .    for an environment that is not too disordered , weaker  localization",
    "\" properties could distinguish quantum from classical random walks too .",
    "a candidate for such a property is related to the asymptotics of the return probability to a given site . to be more precise",
    "we start at a qubit state @xmath2 at a site @xmath3 on the lattice and look at the probability @xmath4 that after time @xmath0 the state will again be localized at site @xmath3 but with unspecified spin orientation .",
    "we adopt the terminology of @xcite and say that the qubit @xmath2 at a site @xmath3 exhibits localization when @xmath4 does not converge to zero as @xmath0 tends to infinity .",
    "we will deal with this notion of localization of single qubit states , which should not be confused with such a global property of disordered quantum systems like anderson localization , and sometimes we will refer to it as  single state localization \" .",
    "irreducible two - state qws on the integers with a constant coin can not exhibit localization , see @xcite for instance .",
    "nevertheless , localization can appear for homogeneous qws if we increase the internal degrees of freedom , @xcite , or the dimension of the lattice , @xcite . a way to get localization in one dimension keeping a constant coin is to destroy the translation invariance by considering the lattice of the non negative integers , see @xcite .",
    "another way of breaking the translation invariance is to introduce defects on the integers . in this context",
    "an important difference between classical and quantum random walks has already been recognized concerning localization of single states . in @xcite ,",
    "n. konno has studied a perturbation of the hadamard qw on the integers and proved that in the case of a particular defect at the origin , and starting from a particular qubit too , the quantity @xmath5 fails to converge to zero .",
    "the method used in @xcite is a path counting argument .",
    "one can think of our paper as an effort to explore the phenomenon uncovered in @xcite in a more general setting by using the cgmv method .",
    "localization can depend on the initial state as well as on the coins of the qw .",
    "our aim is to get a better understanding of these dependencies .",
    "this appears to be a difficult task if one resorts to the usual approaches , like path counting or fourier transform , which usually allow for the computation of the asymptotics of @xmath4 at specific initial qubits or for very limited coin models .",
    "the state and coin dependencies of localization seem to be more tractable from the cgmv point of view .",
    "this is specially true for the state dependence , and we will be able to have a picture of it for a large class of qws . the coin dependence , which is much more involved , will be discussed in some explicit examples .",
    "more precisely , the cgmv approach will allow us to perform a complete classification , according to the localization behaviour , of all the qws with a coin which is constant except for a defect at the origin .    in addressing the study of the dynamics of any quantum system one should keep in mind that there is a large literature on the subject .",
    "the classical book  non - relativistic quantum dynamics \" by w. amrein ( 1981 ) gives a good treatment . for a more recent account",
    "see the book ",
    "hilbert space methods in quantum mechanics \" ( 2009 ) by the same author .",
    "most of the work deals with the spectral properties of the unitary group that implements the quantum evolution and its dynamical consequences .",
    "there are also several papers dealing with these issues of which we just mention two : at a fairly technical level one can consult @xcite , or later work of this same author , and at a more approachable level see @xcite .    in a number of ways",
    "one can say that what we do in great detail is related to the bread and butter of quantum mechanics .",
    "what we call the return probability @xmath4 is related ( but not identical ) to what y. last , @xcite , calls the  survival probability \" , see ( 1.3 ) of his paper .",
    "the main point of our paper is that we manage to compute these quantities explicitly and then study their asymptotic values as @xmath0 goes to infinity .",
    "we now try to give an account of the contents of the present paper , which deals with the localization properties of two - state qws on the integers and the non negative integers .    just as in the kmcg method",
    "used for classical random walks one studies the effect that introducing defects on a simpler walk has on the stieltjes transform of the orthogonality measure , in the quantum case we need to study the so called schur function of the measure .",
    "the analysis of the special features of the schur functions related to qws with distinct coins , with special emphasis in the case of the integers , takes up a good part of section [ s : cmv ] in the present paper .",
    "the results of this section will be key for the rest of the paper .",
    "the general problem of the single state localization within the cgmv language is studied in section [ s : loc ] .",
    "the main result is theorem [ t : loc ] , which establishes a connection between localization in a qw and the singular part of the corresponding orthogonality measure .",
    "in particular , the absence of such a singular part leads to the absence of localized states , while the presence of mass points implies the existence of states which exhibit localization .    among other consequences",
    "the cgmv method shows that , despite its name , single state localization is in fact a quasi global property for a large class of qws so that a localization dichotomy holds in many cases : either no state exhibits localization or at most one state per site is localization free .",
    "such a dichotomy is ensured when the singular part of the measure is not purely continuous .",
    "that is , the state dependence of localization is quite regular for a wide class of qws . in this case",
    "we will refer to qws with or without localization omitting any mention to the initial qubit state .",
    "in section [ s : loc ] we see that the localization dichotomy holds in particular for any qw with periodic coins up to a finite number of defective coins .",
    "it is also shown that , among these qws , the case of strictly periodic coins on the integers is somewhat special because it never gives localization .",
    "qws on the integers whose coins have period @xmath6 are the only one - dimensional qws which are invariant with respect to right and left translations of @xmath6 sites .",
    "thus , we can state that the requirement of a ( right and left ) translation invariance for a one - dimensional qw forces the absence of localization .    in sections [ s : defect ] to [ s",
    ": ret - defect - z+ ] these results are made more specific , both for the non negative integers as well as for the integers , in the case of the simplest perturbation of the constant coin model : the qws with a coin which is constant except for one defect at the origin .",
    "these qws will serve as a laboratory to study the coin dependence of localization in qws .",
    "as we pointed out , localization already appears for two - state qws with a constant coin on the non negative integers but not on the integers where the related measure is absolutely continuous ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the study of qws with one defect acquires a special relevance in the case of the integers because they are the nicest laboratory in which one can study localization on such a lattice . nevertheless",
    ", we will perform also the analysis of one defect on the non negative integers , which will allow us to compare with the case of the integers , thus showing the effects of the boundary conditions on the localization behaviour .    as a particular case of the periodic qws with a finite number of defects , the localization dichotomy holds for qws with one defect .",
    "the analysis of localization in these models becomes the study of the presence of mass points in the corresponding measure .",
    "section [ s : defect ] deals with the general features of the orthogonality measure for qws with one defect at the origin .",
    "it is shown that they fall into groups with the same measure up to rotations , thus with the same localization behaviour .",
    "these groups are labelled by two parameters @xmath7 in the unit disk for the non negative integers , while an additional labelling parameter @xmath8 in the unit circle appears in the case of the integers .",
    "section [ s : loc - defect - z ] shows that @xmath8 actually plays no role in the presence or absence of localization , hence localization for one defect at the origin only depends on two parameters @xmath7 which are defined by the coins of the qw ( in a different fashion for the integers and the non negative integers , see ( [ e : ab - z+ ] ) and ( [ e : ab - z ] ) ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 depends only on the unperturbed coin and the phases of the perturbed one , while @xmath10 depends on the perturbed coin and the phases of the unperturbed one .",
    "sections [ s : loc - defect - z ] and [ s : ret - defect - z ] give a very exhaustive analysis of localization for one defect on the integers , and the same in depth analysis is carried out in sections [ s : loc - defect - z+ ] and [ s : ret - defect - z+ ] for the case of the non negative integers .",
    "sections [ s : loc - defect - z ] and [ s : loc - defect - z+ ] discuss the coin dependence , providing a characterization of localization in terms of the parameters @xmath7 .",
    "sections [ s : ret - defect - z ] and [ s : ret - defect - z+ ] yield explicit results for the asymptotic return probability to the origin for any defect and any initial qubit state .",
    "different localization figures in the space of parameters @xmath7 are presented in sections [ s : loc - defect - z ] and [ s : loc - defect - z+ ] .",
    "they demonstrate that , in contrast to the classical case ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6 ) ) , localization is dominant under the presence of a defect .",
    "nevertheless , these figures also show that , at the same time , there are situations where the absence of localization is stable under small perturbations of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , i.e , under small perturbations of the coins .",
    "in particular , given @xmath11 , the largest regions for the parameter @xmath10 without localization appear when @xmath9 is imaginary , both for the integers and the non negative integers . then there is no localization if @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "concerning the return probabilities @xmath4 , the cgmv method not only shows the dependence of its asymptotics on the initial qubit @xmath2 , but also explains the reason for its possible oscillatory asymptotic behaviour : the presence of the factors @xmath14 in ( [ e : arp ] ) , where @xmath15 are the mass points of the measure .",
    "the return probabilities turn out to be convergent when the singular part of the measure is a unique mass point or , in the case of several mass points , when some symmetries force the mutual cancellation of the cross terms in ( [ e : arp ] ) .",
    "general reasons imply that the return probabilities @xmath16 at odd time vanish for any qw on the integers , which is related to the fact that the mass points on the integers always appear in pairs which are symmetric with respect to the origin .",
    "therefore , in the presence of localization on the integers we can not expect the convergence of @xmath4 but at most of @xmath17 .",
    "this convergence takes place for sure when the singular part of the measure is a single pair of symmetric mass points .",
    "qws on the integers with one defect at the origin have a symmetry under reflection of the sites with respect to the origin which causes the convergence of @xmath18 regardless of the number of mass points .",
    "however , for one defect on the non negative integers with more than one mass point , as well as when considering the return probability @xmath17 to a site @xmath19 on the integers with more than two mass points , the asymptotic behaviour is in general oscillatory .    the state dependence can also disappear in some special situations like , for instance , one defect at the origin on the integers with an imaginary value of @xmath9",
    ". in this case section [ s : ret - defect - z ]",
    "proves that @xmath18 actually converges to the same limit for any initial qubit .",
    "this covers as a special case the result obtained in @xcite for a concrete perturbation of the hadamard model and a specific initial state .",
    "we not only prove that the result in @xcite is state independent , but we also extend this to a more general model with one defect since we find that the state independence holds whenever the products of the diagonal coefficients of the perturbed and the unperturbed coins have the same phase .",
    "section [ s : ret - defect - z ] gives explicitly @xmath20 for any qw on the integers with one defect at the origin .",
    "the convergence of @xmath18 allows for the analysis of the maximum asymptotic return probabilities to the origin , both when running over the qubits @xmath2 and also when running over the parameters @xmath7 , i.e. , over the coins of the model .",
    "we find that @xmath21 approaches one when @xmath22 provided that @xmath23 is bounded from below .",
    "the consequence is that , given a defective coin , for most of the choices of the non defective coin there exist qubits which asymptotically return to the origin with probability almost one , as long as the non defective coin is close enough to an anti - diagonal one .    in the special case of an imaginary @xmath9 ,",
    "the asymptotic return probability @xmath24 does not depend on the state and approaches one when @xmath22 if @xmath25 is bounded from below .",
    "this implies that , when the products of the diagonal coefficients of both coins have similar phases , all the qubits asymptotically return to the origin with probability almost one , provided that the non defective coin is close enough to an anti - diagonal one .",
    "the results above not only show the strength of the cgmv method for the analysis of localization in qws , but they address new research lines with could lead to new and surprising quantum effects .",
    "for instance , it could be very interesting to analyze the localization behaviour of qws where the localization dichotomy is not ensured , i.e. , those whose measure has a singular part which is strictly continuous , and specially those with a purely singular continuous measure .",
    "the physical consequences of singular continuous spectra in quantum mechanics is an active field of research , see for instance @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the study of this problem in those models which can be considered the simplest realization of a dynamical quantum system , i.e. , the qws on a lattice , could make it easier to understand the quantum meaning of a singular continuous spectrum and its dynamical implications .",
    "throughout the paper we will deal with qws on a state space with a basis @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "the quantum dynamics will be governed by unitary coins @xmath28 so that the one - step transitions are given by the operator @xmath29 defined by @xmath30 except when @xmath31 for @xmath32 , in which case the unitarity forces a transition @xmath33 if a diagonal element of a coin were null , the qw would decouple into independent ones , so the requirement @xmath34 is not really a restriction , but it simply means that we are considering only irreducible qws .",
    "once an order is chosen for the basis @xmath26 , it gives a matrix representation @xmath35 of the transition operator @xmath29 , which we will call the transition matrix of the qw . if @xmath36 denotes the @xmath37-th vector of such an ordered basis , we will use the convention that @xmath38 is defined by @xmath39 , so that the one - step evolution @xmath40 reads as @xmath41 using the coordinates @xmath42 of @xmath43 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the order @xmath44 gives a transition matrix @xmath45 , with @xmath46 diagonal unitary and @xmath47 @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 being scalars for @xmath32 and @xmath51-matrices for @xmath52 .",
    "if we refer at the same time to both , scalar and matrix objects , we will use the boldface notation .",
    "however , whenever we wish to distinguish between scalars and matrices we will reserve for the last ones the boldface notation , so in such a case we will denote by @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 the scalars of a qw on @xmath32 .    denoting by @xmath56 the phase of @xmath57 , the coefficients @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath58",

    "the connection between the transition matrix @xmath35 of a qw and the cmv matrices ensures that the laurent polynomials @xmath64 defined by @xmath65 constitute a sequence of orthogonal laurent polynomials ( olp ) with respect to a probability measure @xmath66 supported on the unit circle ( see @xcite ) , i.e. , @xmath67 such olp and measures are scalar or @xmath51-matrix valued for @xmath32 and @xmath52 respectively .",

    "the kmcg formula is the cornerstone of the cgmv method , which takes advantage of the op techniques for the analysis of qws .",

    "in contrast to the case of @xmath32 , three parameters @xmath336 , @xmath375 characterize now the coins ( [ e : c - d ] ) with the same measure up to rotations . on the other hand , just as in the case of @xmath32 , the equality @xmath320 does not hold only for @xmath337 because , remarkably , it is equivalent to the same condition @xmath341 appearing for the non negative integers . also , the consequences of the defect are not only encoded in @xmath10 , but the imaginary value @xmath376 for a constant coin @xmath298 acquires with the defect an extra phase @xmath377 which is the square root of the similar extra phase for the case of @xmath32 . as in @xmath32 , we only need to consider @xmath342 because we know that @xmath378 yields no localization .",
    "the previous discussions indicate that the study of localization in qws leads to the analysis of the mass points ( in general , the singular part ) of the corresponding measure .",

    "surprisingly , for qws with one defect , the mass points analysis is simpler for @xmath52 than for @xmath32 , among other reasons , due to the symmetry of the mass points with respect to the origin , which is lost for @xmath32 .",
    "hence , we will study first localization in a qw on @xmath52 with coins ( [ e : c - d ] ) .    concerning previous related results ,",
    "n. konno has proved in @xcite that the state @xmath379 exhibits localization in @xmath52 for the perturbation of the constant hadamard coin @xmath380 given by @xmath381 whenever @xmath382 .",
    "we will recover this result as a particular case of our analysis but , assuming it for the moment , observe that we have a stronger result : the dichotomy implies that all the states should exhibit localization up to , at most , one state per site .",

    "the aim of this section is to perform a systematic study of localization for any qw with one defect on @xmath52 , which can reveal in the simplest examples the coin dependence of localization properties .    therefore , our purpose is to determine which coins ( [ e : c - d ] ) give in @xmath52 a measure with mass points .",

    "the reason for this is that , when @xmath443 runs over @xmath738 , the phase of @xmath739 performs a rotation of an angle @xmath482 , so the orthogonal straight lines @xmath620 rotate by an angle @xmath740 . then , geometric arguments show that the pair of orthogonal families @xmath618 sweep a region of @xmath129 limited by at most two of the limit lines and that this region includes the set @xmath438 .    as a consequence ,",

    "when @xmath9 is imaginary the limit lines are parallel to the real and imaginary axes because @xmath744 , and the two limit lines which are parallel to the real axis coincide because @xmath496 .",
    "in such a case the region of values of @xmath10 giving localization becomes exactly @xmath438 .",
    "therefore , as in the case of @xmath52 , among the values of @xmath9 with the same modulus the imaginary ones provide the largest region for values of @xmath10 without localization .",
