    "consider a layered 2d acoustic waveguide , which is homogenous in the @xmath0-direction and has a sandwich structure in the @xmath1-direction .",
    "the media constituting the waveguide can be elastic , liquid or gaseous .",
    "waves in such a waveguide are described by a dispersion diagram in the @xmath2 coordinates ( @xmath3 is the temporal circular frequency , @xmath4 is the wavenumber in the @xmath0-direction ) .",
    "usually the dispersion diagram is a graph consisting of several branches ( curves ) .",
    "each point of the dispersion diagram is characterized by two important parameters , namely by phase velocity @xmath5 and group velocity @xmath6 ( the derivative @xmath7 is the slope of corresponding branch of the dispersion diagram ) .",
    "it is well known that wave pulses propagate in the waveguide with corresponding group velocities .",
    "it is well known also that in the experiment typically one can observe the _",
    "first arriving signal _",
    "( fas ) propagating with the velocity of the fastest medium in the structure of the waveguide . in the case of a single elastic isotropic medium",
    "the velocity of the fas is close to the velocity of the longitudinal waves . in some cases",
    "the velocity of the fas is bigger than any of the group velocities provided by the dispersion diagram .",
    "the fas pulse decays with propagation distance unlike the pulses corresponding to usual modal pulses ( the latter are called _ guided waves _ in the medical - related literature ) . thus , fas is a transient process in a waveguide .",
    "it can negligibly small very far from the source , however at moderate distances it can be an important phenomenon .",
    "the most known applications of fas are related to medical acoustics ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a long bone can be considered as a tubular waveguide constituted of three media : a thin outer layer of dense ( cortical ) bone , a sponge bone underneath , and a liquid marrow core in the center .",
    "the fastest wave that can theoretically propagate in such media ( taken separately as infinite spaces ) is the longitudinal wave in the cortical bone .",
    "the sponge bone and the marrow bear much slower waves .",
    "however , when a standard analysis of a waveguide is performed ( say , by the finite element method ) the dispersion diagram contains no branch having group velocity close to the longitudinal cortical velocity .",
    "there exist different approaches to describe fas .",
    "the most comprehensive approach has been proposed by miklowitz and randles in @xcite .",
    "this approach considers an analytical continuation of the dispersion diagram . after passing some branch points , it is possible to find a single branch of the dispersion diagram whose group velocity and decay correspond to fas .",
    "another analytical approach is an application of the classical cagniard ",
    "dehoop technique to invert the fourier transform in the time domain @xcite",
    ". an approximate approach to fas is described in @xcite , where this type of waves is treated as a head wave .",
    "also fas can be approximately described as a leaky mode . for this , the slow media composing the waveguide are declared as elastic half - spaces , while the fastest medium remains to be a layer .",
    "such an approach enables one to compute ( at least in the simplest cases ) the velocity and the decay of fas with an acceptable accuracy .",
    "the aim of the current paper is to present a model of fas based on an elementary analysis of real dispersion diagrams of a layered waveguide",
    ". it is known @xcite that a wave process in a layered waveguide can be treated as an interaction between the modes of different types and velocities .",
    "thus , the dispersion diagram has a `` terrace - like '' structure formed by overlapping of different sets of branches .",
    "since typically no crossing of the branches can happen ( except the branches corresponding to non - interacting waves ) , there occur quasi - crossings at which the type of the mode is changing . a typical fragment of a dispersion diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ( this is a dispersion diagram of a model two - media acoustic waveguide studied in the paper ) . the visible line of the smallest slope ( although this line can be composed of segments corresponding to different branches ) is a _ pseudo - branch _ ) relating to the fas .    in the current paper",
    "this idea is developed into an analytical model .",
    "an approximation of a fragment of the dispersion diagram by a sum of a tangent function and a linear function is constructed .",
    "an analytical continuation of the approximation to the domain of positive @xmath8 $ ] is performed .",
    "the tangent function tends to an imaginary constant there . using this trick ,",
    "the estimation of the decay of fas is obtained .    the idea to study the analytical continuation of the dispersion diagram is inspired by the miklowitz ",
    "randles method @xcite . in the paper",
    "we briefly describe this method and its connection with the description of the fas as a leaky wave .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii a sample problem is formulated . in section  iii a numerical modeling of pulse propagation in the two - media problem",
    "is performed .",
    "the presence of fas and its exponential decay are established . in section",
    "iv the approach by miklowitz ",
    "randles is applied to the waveguide .",
    "the branch of the dispersion diagram responsible for fas is found . in section",
    "v the properties of fas are compared to those of a corresponding leaky wave . in section",
    "vi the signal in the waveguide is represented in the form of an approximation of the phase based on tangent function .",
    "the approximation is analyzed and the parameters of fas are estimated .",
    "the results obtained by miklowitz  randles approach , leaky wave approach and the analysis of the real dispersion diagram are compared .",
    "consider a waveguide in the @xmath9-plane occupying the strip @xmath10 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] ) .",
    "the layer @xmath11 is filled with a medium having density and speed of sound equal to @xmath12 , @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the layer @xmath14 is filled with a medium with parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the wave equations in the media are as follows : @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 are the field variables ( say , acoustical potentials ) , notation @xmath20 stands for the second time derivative .",
    "the boundary conditions are as follows .",
    "the surface @xmath21 is rigid ( neumann ) : @xmath22 on the interface @xmath23 the pressure and the normal velocity are continuous : @xmath24 the surface @xmath25 is also rigid , but a point source is located at the point @xmath26 : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the dirac delta - function , @xmath29 is the time shape of the probe pulse .",
    "the observation point is located at @xmath30 , i.  e. the function @xmath31 is recorded .",
    "the problem of finding the signal on the receiver is quite standard and it can be solved easily .",
    "namely , perform the 2d fourier transform of @xmath32 in the domain of time and frequency : @xmath33 get a 1d problem for @xmath34 as functions of @xmath1 .",
    "these functions should obey the equations @xmath35 the following boundary conditions should be valid : @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38    the solution of ( [ eq0209 ] ) , ( [ eq0210 ] ) , ( [ eq0211 ] ) can be found : @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 the field on the receiver can be obtained by inverting the fourier transformation : @xmath42    formula ( [ eq0215 ] ) can not be used directly , since zeros of the denominator belong to the plane of integration .",
    "the limiting absorption principle is used to change the contour of integration .",
    "namely , for @xmath43 we assume that the velocities @xmath44 have vanishing _ negative _ imaginary parts , while for @xmath45 the velocities @xmath44 have vanishing _ positive _ imaginary parts . due to this , for each @xmath3 the zeros of @xmath46 in the complex @xmath4-plane become displaced from the real axis .",
    "the dispersion diagram represents the zeros of @xmath47 ( for real @xmath44 ) , i.  e.  the dispersion equation is @xmath48 the roots of ( [ eq0216 ] ) are curves in the @xmath49 plane , each point of which corresponds to a wave freely propagating in the waveguide and having @xmath0- and @xmath50-dependence of the form @xmath51 .",
    "the following parameters have been selected for a numerical demonstration of fas presence : @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "dimensionless values are used in the computations , since no particular physical medium is under the investigation .",
    "the values plotted in the graphs are , therefore , also dimensionless . the dispersion diagram for this waveguide",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "the fastest pseudo - branch is shown in the figure as a dashed line .",
    "the pseudo - branch is composed of parts of real branches of the diagram .",
    "one can see that for the selected parameters the pseudo - branch is quite loose , i.  e.  the gaps between its parts are quite wide .    for the demonstration we are using the probe pulse @xmath29 having the spectrum corresponding to the pseudo - branch .",
    "namely , we are using the region @xmath57 . in this region",
    "the group velocities of the guided waves are smaller than  @xmath58 . in the demonstration we are going to show the presence of a pulse whose velocity is approximately equal to the inverse of the slope of the dashed line . this velocity is close to to  4 .",
    "thus , the velocity of the fas is considerably higher than that of any of the guided waves .",

    "[ fig03 ] , left .",
    "the spectrum of this pulse is shown in fig .",

    "one can see that @xmath29 is a radio pulse centered around @xmath59 .",
    "the central circular frequency is about @xmath60 .",

    "[ fig06 ] , respectively .",
    "the field at the receiver , i.  e. @xmath62 , is plotted .",
    "one can see that in all graphs there exists a small pulse , which can be interpreted as fas .",
    "parameters of fas approximately determined from these graphs are given in table  [ tab01 ] .",
    "tof is the `` time of flight '' , i.  e.  the travel time of fas .",
    "one can see that the velocity of the pulse is more than 4 , and the amplitude decay is close to exponential .",
    "such a behavior is typical for fas .",
    "the aim of the rest of the paper will be to estimate the group velocity of the fas pulse @xmath63 and the decay parameter @xmath64 .",
    "the decay parameter is the coefficient in the exponential dependence of the amplitude vs @xmath65 : @xmath66    .parameters of the fas [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the estimation of @xmath67 is , obviously , @xmath68 this parameter is an estimation of @xmath69 .",
    "the estimation of @xmath70 is @xmath71 finally , the estimation of @xmath72 is as follows : @xmath73 since the values of @xmath72 given by ( [ eq1005 ] ) are different for different points @xmath74 , we come to conclusion that @xmath72 in ( [ eq1001 ] ) is a ( slow ) function of @xmath3 . by ( [ eq1005 ] )",
    "we obtain an estimation of @xmath72 at the points @xmath75 , and after that we can , say , interpolate @xmath72 between these points . as we mentioned above",

    "[ figa06 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] collected in table  [ tab02 ] , we can estimate the position of the pseudo - branch and the values of the attenuation parameters .",
    "the points related to the peaks of the group velocity are plotted in fig  [ figa05 ] as small circles .",
    "one can see that the points obtained from the the real dispersion diagram are in reasonably good agreement with the dispersion curve of the leaky wave for real @xmath3 .",
    "it is shown that fas pulses correspond to terrace - like structures of the dispersion diagrams .",
    "these structures are called pseudo - branches in the paper . a typical form of the pseudo - branch is shown in fig .  [ fig01 ] .",
    "the pulse propagation velocity for fas is the inverse of the slope of the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] , and it can be larger than any of the group velocities available in the considered part of the dispersion diagram .    in the paper",
    "we describe three different approaches to finding the velocity and the decay of fas pulses .",
