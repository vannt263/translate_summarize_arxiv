    "the question of whether a short gamma - ray burst ( sgrb ) is generated by a compact binary merger is still under active investigation . from the observational front ,",
    "the location and distribution of sgrbs in elliptical galaxies with large offsets from their hosts , together with the lack of an association with star - forming regions and supernovae , have thus far lent indirect support for the hypothesis @xcite .",
    "a strong direct potential evidence was proposed by li and paczynski in 1998 @xcite in the form of a kilonova emitted via the radioactive decay of @xmath2-process material ejected by a compact binary merger . a possible kilonova associated with the sgrb 130603b",
    "was observed in 2013 by tanvir , _ et al _ @xcite as a transient in the near infrared band in line with the earlier possible detection by berger , _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "subsequently , a reanalysis of the grb 060614 optical afterglow data have yielded the first ever multiepoch / band light curves that have considerable agreement with black hole - neutron star ( bhns ) merger kilonovae @xcite .",
    "these findings reinforced the compact binary progenitor hypothesis as a frontrunner theory of sgrb generation .",
    "incidentally , compact binaries have also been identified as the most promising sources of gravitational waves , and the first ever detections pointing to binary black hole ( bbh ) systems as sources , have been announced in the gw150914 and gw151226 events by the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) scientific collaboration and the virgo collaboration ( lvc ) @xcite .",
    "given the predicted rates and sensitivity of the advanced ligo / virgo / kagra detectors @xcite , the detection of gravitational waves from compact binary mergers involving at least one neutron star ( ns ) , is imminent .",
    "a sgrb would serve as an excellent electromagnetic counterpart to gravitational waves from these compact binary mergers .",
    "the sgrb engine in this picture is comprised of a hot , dense and massive accretion disk around a remnant rotating black hole ( bh ) formed after a compact binary merger @xcite .",
    "the lifetime of the disk is comparable to the duration of the sgrb , implying hyperaccretion rates several orders of magnitude greater than those of other accreting bh systems such as active galactic nuclei and microquasars @xcite . in bhns mergers ,",
    "it has been shown in fully general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations that the disk is formed when the ns is tidally disrupted by the companion bh @xcite .",
    "the launch of the relativistic jet that results in the sgrb is then predicated upon the presence of an initially baryon - poor region along the bh rotation axis @xcite , where matter outflow is highly collimated with high lorentz factors .",
    "a variety of studies on these jets have unravelled several key factors on how they could emerge in bhns mergers ( for an early effort in nsns mergers , see ref .",

    "this in turn generates the wind structure that drags the magnetic field into a large - scale configuration along a funnel wall .",

    "deviations from the _ mean _ reflect the highly asymmetric configuration of the plasma flow around the bh as well as the magnetic field embedded inside , as could be expected from a merger scenario .",
    "@xmath112 for the velocity perturbations is taken to be the position vector for the center of the cubic domain , whereas @xmath113 is taken to be the position vector relative to this center .",
    "the velocity perturbations , @xmath114 , are evaluated as @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the volume average of the velocities in the respective cubes .",
    "we then take the wave number of the mode which generates the highest amplitude in the kinetic energy spectrum and denote it as @xmath117 .",
    "figure  [ fig : kmaxt ] shows the change in time of the _ mean _ kinetic energy of this dominant mode .",
    "the trend that is apparent from this measure is that the _ mean _ kinetic energy in all the thermalized volumes is decreasing even as the episodes of steady wind are occurring .",
    "assuming that the mechanism described in ref .",
    "@xcite holds here , a decreasing mean kinetic energy in time would mean a decreasing efficiency in the conversion of mass accretion energy into thermal energy as time progresses .",
    "this appears to be consistent with the expectation that the ejected mass would asymptote to a given amount at late times .    at @xmath118ms which coincides with the beginning of the first wind episode",
    ", we compare the turbulent kinetic energy spectra between the symmetric * sym * and asymmetric case * asym60 * ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kt30mean ] ) .",
    "mean _ amplitude of the spectra for the symmetric case is decidedly lower than that for the asymmetric one .",
    "this could indicate that the helicity in the magnetic field is generating a higher _ overall _ turbulent kinetic energy . at @xmath119ms , the difference between the ejected masses between * sym * and * asym60 * reaches @xmath120 of the total ejected mass for * sym*.    in an unprecedented resolution study performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is seen that increasing resolution yields higher ejected mass at a given time . as mentioned above ,",
    "this has been explained as due to the higher efficiency with which the thermalization of the mass accretion energy takes place , which is attributed to the higher _ effective _ turbulent viscosities realized at higher resolutions . the total amount of ejected mass from the highest resolution run in ref .",
    "@xcite in the time scale simulated is thus designated as the lower bound . since certain qualitative features of",
    "the nonaxisymmetric mri appears to have been captured in all our cases , we hypothesize that a similar resolution study performed for the cases in the current paper would produce a similar trend , i.e. , that with increased resolution , the efficiency of the thermalization of the mass accretion energy would increase , leading to higher ejected mass at a given time , or in other words , an earlier mass ejection episode for _ all _ the cases here , both symmetric and asymmetric .",
    "the increase in ejected mass at a given time could reach @xmath121 when the resolution is doubled ( see fig . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , much higher than the @xmath122 increase that could be reached purely by a helicity - induced enhancement of the turbulent kinetic energy as seen in the current study .",
    "it has to be noted that even in ref .",
    "@xcite where 32,768 cpus on the k supercomputer are used in their highest resolution run , convergence in the amount of ejected mass is still not seen .",
    "indeed , since the dissipation happens on the grid scale , convergence would not be seen with increasing resolution , unless a large explicit viscosity , resolvable by the given resolutions , is introduced @xcite . nonetheless , confirming whether the total amount of ejected mass would increase with the _ degree _ of asymmetry would still call for a thorough resolution study as well as a systematic one , so as to gauge whether the above - mentioned increases in the ejected mass will be trumped out by finite - resolution errors . because of the prohibitive computational resources required",
    ", we are presently unable to present such studies . using the results presented in the current paper as hints",
    ", we intend to perform the latter once the problem of computational resources becomes tractable .",
    "in this study , we conduct long - term grmhd simulations of bhns mergers ( up to @xmath0ms after merger ) where the ns is tidally disrupted by the bh forming a massive accretion disk . the ns is endowed with an asymmetric dipole with a helical component .",
    "we study three cases where one case is endowed with a symmetric dipole and two cases are endowed with two different degrees of helicity respectively . the magnetic field amplification in the merger remnant is clarified by performing a linear analysis based on the nonaxisymmetric mri @xcite , and comparing with the growth rates of the magnetic field in the accretion disk obtained from the simulations .",
    "both the toroidal and poloidal fields are amplified exponentially by the mri up to an order of magnitude .",
    "the toroidal field follows linear theory very closely except for the case with the highest degree of helicity studied here whereas the poloidal field growth is largely nonlinear due to poor resolvability and turbulence .",
    "the deviation of the latter from linear theory prediction increases as asymmetry increases , in line with the increase in turbulence in the asymmetric cases .",
    "the mri growth is estimated to be in the ideal mhd regime throughout almost the entire bulk of the accretion disk , so would thus be free from effects induced in the event neutrino radiation occurs . we conclude that our cases with the resolution employed have eluded the most rapidly growing modes for the nonaxisymmetric system , even though certain qualitative features of the nonaxisymmetric mri , such as the sustained turbulence , have been captured .",
    "two strong thermally driven wind episodes along a funnel wall above and below the bh close to its rotation axis are uncovered in all the cases .",
    "the formation of a large - scale coherent field in the poloidal direction is accompanied by a strong poynting flux , both of which could enhance the prospects of sgrb jet formation .",
    "however , due to the relatively small variation in the amount of ejected mass , we are unable presently to confirm whether the asymmetry in the initial magnetic field indeed produces enhanced mass ejection corresponding to the _ degree _ of asymmetry without a thorough resolution study .",
    "the simulations were performed on sr16000 at yitp of kyoto university and with supercomputing resources including technical support at the korean national institute of supercomputing and network ( nisn ) .",
    "the work was also supported by chinese nsfc grants no .",
    "11375153 and no . 11675145 , and by ibs through project code ( grant no .",
    "ibs - r024-d1 ) .",
    "mbw is grateful to kenta kiuchi and masaru shibata for providing the code for the simulations and for helpful discussions , as well as to koutarou kyutoku for providing the initial data .",
