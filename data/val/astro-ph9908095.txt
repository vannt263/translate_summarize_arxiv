    "for simplicity , traditional models of accretion disks ignore the self - gravity associated with the accreting material and consider the case where the disk is approximately keplerian ( e.g. , see pringle @xcite ) . on the other hand , several studies have been carried out in order to investigate the effects related to the disk self - gravity .",
    "studies of this type have addressed three different levels .",
    "the first stage is that where the disk self - gravity is incorporated in the study of the vertical structure of the disk .",
    "here we may recall , among others , the pioneering work by paczyski ( @xcite ) and the very recent analysis by bardou et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the second important level is that where one considers the effects of the disk self - gravity on waves and on transport processes in the disk .",
    "here we may recall a number of interesting analyses , in particular the studies by lin & pringle ( @xcite ) , by adams et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , with the modified viscosity prescription proposed by lin & pringle ( @xcite ) ( see also andalib et al . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recent hydrodynamical simulations ( laughlin & bodenheimer @xcite , laughlin & ryczka @xcite , laughlin et al .",
    "@xcite ) have focused on one key aspect of the modeling of accretion disks .",
    "i.e. they have tried to assess whether the standard constant @xmath0 viscosity prescription ( shakura & sunyaev @xcite ) is justified in systems where non - axisymmetric instabilities driven by the disk self - gravity play a major role .",
    "the third level where the self - gravity of the disk can be considered is that where , because of the gravitational field contributed by the disk matter , the rotation itself of the accreting material is affected and is no longer kept to be keplerian . in this direction very few attempts have been made ( see , e.g. , bodo & curir @xcite ) .",
    "the need for investigations where the self - gravity of the disk is properly taken into account is further stimulated by recent accurate observations that point to significant deviations from keplerian rotation in objects that are naturally interpreted as accretion disks ( e.g. , see greenhill et al .",
    "@xcite , moran @xcite ) and by the finding that in some contexts , especially in the dynamics of protostellar disks , there are empirical indications that the amount of mass in the disk is large ( see hillenbrand et al .",
    "@xcite , drimmel @xcite ) . from the theoretical point of view , to address the dynamics of a self - gravitating accretion disk is highly attractive especially because some _ global _ regulation aspects that are emerging as interesting and relevant from various lines of thought ( see also coppi @xcite ) should find a natural manifestation in systems where the long - range forces are bound to generate an inherently global behavior .",
    "the basic framework for the construction of models of accretion disks is traditionally  asymmetric \" . while the momentum transport equations are generally replaced by a physically based prescription that bypasses our ignorance on the detailed mechanisms that are involved ( shakura & sunyaev @xcite ; see also the recent modification proposed by heyvaerts et al .",
    "@xcite and bardou et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the energy transport equations are usually kept in their ideal form , either following a detailed inclusion of the radiation transport across the disk ( e.g. , see shakura & sunyaev @xcite ; bardou et al .",
    "@xcite ) or by invoking some ideal  equation of state \" and by arguing that the energy dissipated by viscosity is partly redistributed in the disk ( see narayan & yi @xcite and many following articles ) . in a situation where we lack strong empirical constraints ( such as those that might be available in the laboratory ) on the detailed mechanisms at the basis of the various transport processes involved",
    ", one might try to explore models where self - gravity , much like in galaxy disks , plays a major role at all the three levels mentioned above , taking the view that _ both _ momentum and energy transport equations should be handled heuristically .",
    "this is indeed the step taken in an earlier exploratory paper ( bertin @xcite ) , where the viscosity prescription suggested by shakura & sunyaev ( @xcite ) is retained , and , on a similar footing , the energy transport equations are replaced by a physical condition of self - regulation , related to marginal jeans stability , as suggested by the dynamics of galaxy disks ( see sect .",
    "3 ) .    in this paper",
    "we develop this latter point of view by describing the entire parameter space available for _ self - regulated accretion disks _ ( sects . 2 and 4 ) , and by providing two non - trivial extensions of the model .",
    "the first extension is that of a  bimodal \" disk , where full matching with an inner  standard \" keplerian accretion disk is obtained ( see sect . 5.1 ) .",
    "the second extension is the construction of self - regulated accretion disks embedded in a spherical diffuse  halo \" , which may find application to the extended disk associated with agn s .",
    "the analysis is further strengthened by a careful discussion of the vertical structure of the disk , in such a way that the transition from self - gravity dominated to non - gravitating disks is covered uniformly ( appendix a ) .",
    "we consider a steady , axisymmetric , geometrically thin accretion disk , with constant mass and angular momentum accretion rates , which we call @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the conservation laws for mass and angular momentum , in cylindrical coordinates , are : @xmath3 @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the surface density of the disk , @xmath6 is the radial velocity , @xmath7 is the angular velocity , and @xmath8 is the viscosity coefficient .",
    "note that we take @xmath9 in the case of inflow . usually on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ consangmoment ] ) the two terms have opposite signs ; the first term describes convection of angular momentum , while the second ( negative in the common situation where @xmath10 ) accounts for the angular momentum transport due to viscous torques .",
    "thus @xmath11 corresponds to a net angular momentum influx .    for a cool , slowly accreting disk , the radial balance of forces requires : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the mass of the central object and @xmath14 is the disk contribution to the gravitational potential .",
    "the radial gravitational field generated by the disk can be written as : @xmath15\\sqrt{\\frac{r'}{r}}k\\sigma(r')dr ' ,                      \\end{array } \\label{campovero}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are complete elliptic integrals of the first kind , and ( see gradshteyn & ryzhik @xcite ) .",
    "the field @xmath18 in the equatorial plane is obtained by taking the limit @xmath19 .",
    "here we have preferred to refer directly to the field ( and not to the potential , as was done by bertin @xcite ) and to the formulae applicable to the case @xmath20 ; this representation is more convenient in view of the numerical investigations that we have in mind ( see sects . 4 and 5 ) .    for the viscosity",
    "we follow the standard prescription ( shakura & sunyaev @xcite ) : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the effective thermal velocity and @xmath23 the half - thickness of the disk . here",
    "@xmath0 is a dimensionless parameter , with @xmath24 ; in the following we take it to be a constant .    in the case of dominant disk self - gravity",

    "( [ campovero ] ) , and eq .",
    "( [ angular ] ) ) , we need an additional relation . in standard studies",
    "this is provided by an energy transport equation ( see , for example , pringle @xcite ; narayan & popham @xcite ; narayan & yi @xcite ) .",
    "here we consider an alternative scenario ( bertin @xcite ) where the energy equation is _ replaced _ by the requirement of marginal jeans stability : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the epicyclic frequency .",
    "this assumes the presence of a suitable _ self - regulation mechanism _ ( see sect . 3 below ) . for a given value of @xmath0 and @xmath31",
    ", we now have a complete set of equations , depending on the three parameters @xmath13 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "we recall that the parameter @xmath32 is the fluid analogue of the axisymmetric stability parameter introduced and described by toomre ( @xcite ) in his analysis of the stability of a stellar disk .      in the special case of @xmath33 and @xmath34 ,",
    "the problem is solved by the self - similar solution with flat rotation curve ( bertin @xcite ) , characterized by : @xmath35 the other properties of the disk are specified by : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ mest ] ) describes the self - similar disks found by mestel ( @xcite ) in the non - accreting case .",
    "the same solution is also valid asymptotically at large radii even when @xmath13 and @xmath2 do not vanish .",
    "in fact , the effect of a non - zero @xmath13 should be unimportant for @xmath40 while the effects of a non - zero @xmath2 should be unimportant for @xmath41 . here",
    "the definitions of @xmath42 and @xmath43 are slightly different from those adopted earlier ( bertin @xcite ) .      for a given value of @xmath0 and @xmath31 and for a specified accretion rate @xmath1 ,",
    "the general case is a problem with a well - defined physical lengthscale @xmath42 and one dimensionless parameter @xmath44 . in the following",
    "we wish to explore the properties of the mathematical solutions in the entire parameter space available ( in particular , for both positive and negative values of @xmath45 ) .",
    "the knowledge of these solutions is a prerequisite for a discussion of any specific astrophysical application . at a later stage",
    ", the physical problem under investigation is expected to restrict the relevant parameter space .    in order to calculate such one - parameter family of solutions , we start by writing the relevant equations in dimensionless form , in such a way that the self - similar solution described above is easily recognized .",
    "we thus introduce three _ deviation functions _",
    "@xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , which are related to the dimensional disk density @xmath5 , rotation curve @xmath49 , and effective thermal speed @xmath22 by the following definitions : @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "clearly the functions @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath48 are all positive definite ; the self - similar solution corresponds to @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 .    in terms of the dimensionless",
    "radial coordinate @xmath59 , the basic set of equations ( corresponding to eqs.([eulero ] ) , ( [ campovero ] ) , ( [ angular ] ) , and ( [ jeans ] ) ) thus become : @xmath60+\\frac{1}{x}\\ ] ] @xmath61=\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_0^{\\infty}dx'\\frac{k}{\\sqrt{xx'}}\\times\\\\   & \\displaystyle\\left[k(k)-\\frac{1}{4}\\frac{k^2}{1-k^2}\\left(\\frac{x'}{x}-\\frac{x}{x'}+\\frac{\\delta^2}{xx'}\\right)e(k)\\right]\\rho(x ' ) ,                  \\end{array}\\ ] ] @xmath62 @xmath63 with @xmath64 $ ] , in the limit @xmath65 .",
    "in the case of outward angular momentum flux ( @xmath66 ) , the above equations can be readily solved by iteration in the following way .",
    "an initial seed solution @xmath67 is inserted in eqs .",
    "( [ chi ] ) and ( [ sigma ] ) , thus leading to a first approximation to the density deviation @xmath68 .",
    "this is inserted in eq .",
    "( [ velocita1 ] ) , then producing ( via eq .",
    "( [ velocita ] ) ) a new expression for the rotation curve deviation @xmath69",
    ". typically three or four iterations are sufficient to reach a satisfactory convergence .",
    "for the case when the net angular momentum flux is inwards ( @xmath70 ) , eq .",
    "( [ chi ] ) shows that we may run into a difficulty at small radii , where the quantity @xmath71 changes sign .",
    "here we may proceed by analogy with standard studies ( e.g. , see pringle @xcite ) , by restricting our analysis to the outer disk defined by @xmath72 , with the condition @xmath73 , i.e. @xmath74 .",
    "this is taken to occur at a point where the angular velocity @xmath75 reaches a maximum ( so that @xmath76 and @xmath48 may remain finite ) ; such maximum is identified as a location , in the vicinity of the surface of the central object , to which the accretion disk is imagined to be connected by a relatively narrow boundary layer . of course",
    ", in the boundary layer the physical processes will be different from those described in our model ( for example , there will be effects due to pressure gradients and the disk will be thick ) . thus we will not be able to follow the associated ( inwards ) decline of the angular velocity away from the keplerian profile . as a result ,",
    "in our calculation we let the effective thermal speed vanish at @xmath77 ; this unphysical behavior would be removed when one describes the boundary layer with more realistic physical conditions ( see popham & narayan @xcite ) .",
    "[ chiboundary ]",
    "before proceeding further , we should make here a digression and try to better explain the physical justification at the basis of the regulation prescription set by eq .",
    "( [ jeans ] ) , which is the distinctive property of the class of models addressed in this paper .",
    "this discussion expands and clarifies a brief description provided earlier ( bertin @xcite ) .",
    "we start by noting that , when self - gravity dominates , processes associated with the jeans instability basically determine the relevant scales of inhomogeneity of the system under consideration . on the other hand , it is well known ( toomre @xcite ) that in the plane of a thin , self - gravitating , rotating disk the tendency toward collapse driven by self - gravity , which is naturally expected to be balanced locally only at small wavelengths by pressure forces , can be fully healed by rotation also at small wavenumbers . as a result ,",
    "if the disk is sufficiently warm , it can be locally stable against all axisymmetric disturbances .",
    "the condition of marginal stability thus ensured is usually cast in the form @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is proportional to the effective thermal speed of the disk .",
    "therefore , in galactic dynamics it has long been recognized that an initially cold disk is subject to rapid evolution , on the dynamical timescale . for a stellar disk ,",
    "the jeans instability induces fast overall heating of the disk up to levels of the effective thermal speed for which the instability is removed , basically following the above criterion ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the heating rate is thus very sensitive to the instantaneous value of @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , even in the absence of dissipation , for relatively low values of @xmath79 the collective jeans instability provides a mechanism to stir the system and to heat it .",
    "however , a collisionless non - dissipative disk would be unable to evolve in the opposite direction , i.e. to cool if initially hot ( @xmath81 ) , and , because of other residual processes ( such as tidal interactions ) , may still be subject to some perennial heating even when jeans instability is ineffective . in turn , if efficient dissipation is available ( such as that associated with the interstellar medium in galaxy disks ) , a competing mechanism can cool an initially hot disk down toward conditions of marginal jeans instability .",
    "these important dynamical ingredients have been studied from various points of view , giving rise to interesting scenarios , also by means of numerical experiments ( see miller et al .",
    "@xcite , quirk @xcite , quirk & tinsley @xcite , sellwoood & carlberg @xcite , ostriker @xcite ) , so that eventually the possibility of an actual _ self - regulation _ in self - gravitating disks has been formulated and explored .",
    "accordingly , the two competitive mechanisms , of dynamical heating and dissipative cooling , can set up a kind of dynamical thermostat .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that self - regulation is very important in determining the conditions for the establishment of spiral structure in galaxies ( bertin and lin @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "the general concept has also found successful application to the dynamics of the interstellar medium , even when dynamically decoupled from the stellar component , in relation to the interpretation of the observed star formation rates ( quirk @xcite ; kennicutt @xcite ) .",
    "note that the most delicate aspect of the regulation process is the cooling mechanism ; in galaxy disks , an important contribution to cooling is thus provided by cloud - cloud inelastic collisions that dissipate energy on a fast timescale .",
    "a final remark is in order . as shown by the case of galaxy disks",
    ", the dynamics involved may be extremely complex , so that there is little hope to provide a simple  ideal \" energy equation for the description of a coupled disk of stars ( of different populations ) and gas ( in different forms and phases ) .",
    "this point has an additional important consequence .",
    "if we try to describe such an inherently complex system by means of an idealized one - component model , we should be ready to introduce the use of some _ effective _ quantities ( in particular , of an effective thermal speed ; see also the use of the term `` effective '' after eq .",
    "( [ nu ] ) and at the beginning of this subsection ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that the main strength of the self - regulation scenario described above is rooted in semi - empirical arguments .",
    "the actual data from many galaxy disks ( among which the milky way galaxy ) and from planetary rings show that conditions of marginal stability ( @xmath82 ) often occur and can indeed be established in systems subject to complex dynamical processes . for accretion disks , there may already be some empirical indications in this direction , to the extent that the application of standard models to some observed systems points to very cold disks , with @xmath79 well below unity ( e.g. , see kumar @xcite , as briefly mentioned in sect . 6 ) .",
    "additional clues in the same direction also derive from numerical experiments ; in the context of protostellar disks , numerical simulations show that disks formed under conditions where self - gravity is important include wide regions characterized by a constant @xmath79-profile ( pickett et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "an accretion disk may be subject to efficient cooling by a variety of mechanisms , depending on the physical conditions that characterize the specific astrophysical system under consideration . from this point of view , the cooling necessary for the establishment of self - regulation may occur efficiently already via the radiative processes included in  standard \" models ( see the general discussion of the outer disk by bardou et al .",
    "@xcite , which we will summarize in sect .",
    "5.1 ) . in reality",
    ", the dynamics of matter slowly accreting in a disk can be significantly more complex .",
    "cold systems , such as a protogalactic disk , a protostellar disk , or the outer parts of the disk in an agn , may have a composite and complex structure .",
    "they may include dust , gas clouds , and other particulate objects with a whole variety of sizes and  temperatures \" .",
    "much like for the hi component of the interstellar medium , the main contribution to the effective temperature of the disk might be from the turbulent speed of an otherwise cold medium .",
    "on the one hand , for these systems it may be hard or even impossible to write out a simple  ideal \" energy transport equation .",
    "on the other hand , such a complex environment is likely to possess all the desired cooling and heating mechanisms that cooperate in self - regulation . in this respect ,",
    "one is thus encouraged to bypass the problem of defining a representative set of equations for energy transport , and to use instead the semiempirical prescription of eq .",
    "( [ jeans ] ) .",
    "somewhat in a similar way , our inability to derive from first principles a satisfactory set of equations for momentum transport is often taken to justify the adoption of the @xmath0-prescription of eq .",
    "( [ nu ] ) .",
    "these phenomenological prescriptions have several limitations , but may still work as a useful guide to our efforts and provide interesting models to be compared with the observations .    to be sure , some types of accretion disk , or some regions inside accretion disks ( for example , very close to the center ; see sect .",
    "5.1 ) , may lack the physical ingredients invoked above .",
    "in fact , there is no reason to claim that self - gravity must _ always _ be important .",
    "therefore , we will study the structure of self - regulated accretion disks , as a viable class of astrophysical systems , while we do recognize that warmer , non - regulated disks may exist and are likely to be basically free from the effects associated with the self - gravity of the disk .",
    "the self - regulation mechanism has been demonstrated by considering a simplified set of equations ( bertin @xcite ) where efficient cooling is included and the role of self - gravity is modeled by means of a heating term with an analytic expression ( inversely proportional to a high power of @xmath79 ) meant to incorporate the results of dynamical studies that show that heating is indeed very sensitive to the value of q. the main features of this formula , with its threshold at @xmath82 , aimed at representing the  thermal evolution \" of the disk , are somewhat analogous to the heuristic characterization of the viscosity dependence on @xmath79 adopted by lin & pringle ( @xcite ) in the parallel problem of constructing the momentum transport equations when self - gravity is important .    in our discussion of self - regulated accretion disks , we actually have no doubt that self - gravity is likely to have an important impact on viscosity , and this is still tacitly incorporated in the @xmath0 prescription .",
    "this impact is even more obvious if one recalls that a self - gravitating disk can be subject to non - axisymmetric instabilities , which are bound to contribute significantly to angular momentum transport .",
    "our class of axisymmetric , steady - state accretion models represents only one approximate idealization of the actual system that we are addressing .",
    "given the indications of several dynamical studies ( in addition to those of lin & pringle , see , for example , laughlin & bodenheimer @xcite , laughlin & ryczka @xcite ) , a more complete analysis should thus include one further relation between @xmath0 and @xmath79 . in general , this might practically require that the phenomenological prescription ( [ nu ] ) be used with a parameter @xmath0 varying with radius .",
    "in reality , we believe that the proper way to include the relevant physical effects , especially those associated with non - axisymmetric instabilities , would be through some _ global _ constraint .",
    "until such global description remains not available , the assumption of a free , constant @xmath0 may provide a first approximation , best applicable when @xmath79 is self - regulated .",
    "this choice can be physically consistent _ a posteriori _ , at least for the self - similar solution of sect . 2.2 .",
    "after this digression , we can now proceed with the analysis of the problem as formulated in sect .",
    "2 . in the presence of a central point mass ( @xmath83 )",
    "we expect the lengthscale @xmath42 to mark the transition from a keplerian disk to a fully self - gravitating disk with flat rotation curve .",
    "surprisingly , in our class of self - regulated accretion disks the role of the disk self - gravity turns out to be significant all the way down to the center .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : rotazione ] we illustrate the behavior of the rotation curves in our class of models for several values of the angular momentum flux parameter @xmath45 . for comparison",
    ", we also show the keplerian curve @xmath84 that is obtained by setting @xmath85 .",
    "we note that the difference from the keplerian decline is significant even at @xmath86 .",
    "for example , for the @xmath87 case we find @xmath88 at @xmath89 .",
    "disks where the angular momentum is transported outwards ( @xmath66 ) tend to develop a warmer core , while the opposite trend occurs for disks where the angular momentum is carried inwards ( @xmath70 ) .",

    "[ fig : massa ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : epsilon ] , and fig .",
    "[ fig : spessore ] are shown in logarithmic scale to better bring out the behavior in the inner parts of the disk ) .",
    "note that in the case of inward angular momentum flux ( @xmath70 ) the effective thermal speed need not vanish at the inner edge of the disk ( as it does in our models ) where a boundary layer is expected to be generated ( see discussion at the end of section [ chiboundary ] ) .",
    "there are several quantities directly related to the disk density distribution in the disk that allow us to characterize the role of the disk self - gravity .",
    "the most natural quantity to consider is the ratio of the mass of the disk to that of the central object .",
    "obviously , for our non - truncated models this quantity is meaningful only when referred to a given radius .",
    "[ fig : massa ] shows how rapidly in radius the system becomes dominated by the mass of the disk .",
    "note that , in any case , @xmath90 for @xmath91 .    in galactic dynamics",
    "the local disk self - gravity is usually measured in terms of the parameter @xmath92 . the fully self - gravitating self - similar disk ( with flat rotation curve )",
    "is characterized by @xmath93 .",
    "the profile of this parameter ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : epsilon ] ) confirms that indeed , close to the center , the influence of the central mass becomes stronger and stronger .",
    "given the behavior of the profiles @xmath94 and @xmath95 , one might conclude that the innermost disk should be treated as a standard keplerian accretion disk .",
    "this conclusion is contradicted by the following argument . in setting up the equations of our models ,",
    "we have taken the vertical equilibrium to be dominated by the disk self - gravity ( see eq .",
    "( [ acca ] ) ) .",
    "if the innermost disk were fully keplerian , at small radii the vertical scaleheight @xmath96 should become much smaller than the thickness @xmath23 associated with our models .",
    "instead , a plot of the ratio @xmath97 only shows that the two scales become _ comparable _ to each other ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spessore ] ) , thus demonstrating that the influence of the disk self - gravity is significant all the way to the center .",
    "this , of course , reflects our choice of imposing the self - regulation prescription ( eq .",
    "( [ jeans ] ) ) at all radii ; in the next section we will show that the disk can indeed make a true transition to a keplerian disk if the self - regulation prescription is suitably relaxed .    in view of the above considerations , in order to check that no major consequences arise from the use of a vertical equilibrium prescription only partly justified for @xmath98 , we have also considered models based on the improved prescription for the disk thickness ( see appendix a ) :    @xmath99 .",

    "this plot ( along with similar results for the other relevant physical quantities of the disk ) shows that , qualitatively , the more refined vertical analysis leaves the models basically unchanged .",
    "if we take an astrophysical situation ( such as an agn or a protostar ) with specific physical conditions , it is likely that the arguments that support the adoption of the self - regulation constraint , followed in this paper , fail outside a well - defined radial range , either at small or at large radii . for example , we may recall that in the context of the dynamics of spiral galaxies the relevant @xmath79 profile is argued to be flat in the outer disk , but is thought to increase inwards inside a circle of radius @xmath104 often identified as the radial scale of influence of the bulge ; even in the absence of a bulge , the central parts of the disk are thought to be generally hotter ( e.g. , see bertin & lin , @xcite ) . in our context , we may then imagine an accretion disk where at small radii self - regulation fails , @xmath79 becomes large , and , correspondingly , the disk self - gravity ceases to be important .",
    "this discussion suggests that it should be interesting to explore the possibility where eq .",
    "( [ jeans ] ) is replaced by a condition of the form @xmath105 , with a @xmath79 profile that decreases monotonically with radius and reaches the self - regulation value @xmath31 only beyond a certain radial scale @xmath104",

    "as we are going to do , a given profile @xmath106 may , at first sight , appear to be arbitrary .",

    "it is up to us to test the different possibilities ( which may correspond to completely different sets of energy balance equations in the inner disk ) that might be considered . for our purposes , since we wish to study the deviations from the standard `` keplerian '' case , we only need to take into account that the relevant physical processes match so that in the outer disk self - regulation is enforced .",

    "( [ qprofile ] ) ( see fig . [",
    "fig : qprofile ] ) show how an outer disk dominated by self - gravity can match in detail with an inner standard keplerian accretion disk .",
    "so far we have considered the case where the mass is all distributed in a disk ( either at the center , as a point mass , or in diffuse form ) . in view of possible applications to agn configurations or to the general galactic context",
    ", it is important to consider an extension of the models to the case where part of the gravitational field is determined by a diffuse spherical component , which we will call _ halo _ ( even if it may just correspond to the central region of an elliptical galaxy ) .",
    "this will lead to rotation curves otherwise not accessible by our models . on the other hand",
    ", it is easily recognized that this natural extension is going to leave the slow density decline of the disk unaltered .",
    "therefore , if we are interested in producing models with finite total mass , we should be ready to impose an outer truncation radius or , which might effectively be equivalent , to relax the self - regulation prescription in the outermost disk .",
    "we have thus considered a set of models where the field external to the disk is produced by the joint contribution of a central point mass and of a halo ( which , for simplicity , we take to be spherical ) . in view of the case of a disk embedded in an elliptical galaxy ,",
    "we have modeled the halo as approximately isothermal , with a finite core radius . in this case the dimensionless equation giving the rotation curve ( eq .",

    "it is easy to demonstrate that at large radii the density deviation @xmath46 approaches @xmath116 if @xmath118 , and @xmath119 if @xmath120 .    in fig .",

    "self - regulated accretion disks with finite mass can be easily constructed by imposing the existence of an outer truncation radius .",
    "either the study of the collapse of a gas cloud with finite mass or the consideration of the physical conditions in the outer parts of some astrophysical objects will naturally bring us to address such models .",
    "in this paper we have developed a framework for the construction of a class of self - gravitating accretion disks , independently of the specific conditions characterizing the astrophysical systems where the accretion disk paradigm applies . in principle",
    ", we might even speculate that the above framework could be the starting point to describe some stages of the formation of protogalactic disks ( e.g. see fall & efstathiou @xcite ) or the establishment of some regular extended hi disks in elliptical galaxies ( see morganti et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in practice",
    ", our class of models appears to be best applicable to two categories of astrophysical objects , i.e. to active galactic nuclei and to protostellar disks .",
    "concrete applications , which will require a detailed consideration of the available observational constraints , are beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "still we would like to make a few comments that should illustrate why the models appear to be promising for the above categories of objects .",
    "recently , from radio maser emission , it has been possible to obtain accurate measurements of the rotation of the disk in the central parts of a few active galactic nuclei ; these include , , , , , and ( see moran , @xcite ) .",
    "these measurements have shown that , although in some cases ( as for , see miyoshi et al .",
    "@xcite ) the rotation curve is keplerian to a high degree of approximation , there may be significant deviations from the @xmath123 profile .",
    "for example , in the rotation velocity at distances @xmath124 pc from the  center \" turns out to decline as @xmath125 ( see greenhill et al .",
    "@xcite ; kumar @xcite ) .",
    "the general conclusion is that rather extended disks , which may contain large amounts of mass , are present ; indeed one possible reason for the deviation from the keplerian decline has been identified in the influence of the gravitational field contributed by the accretion disk itself . at the same time",
    ", the application of  standard \" accretion disk models to some of these objects has led to finding values of the @xmath79 parameter well below unity ( for , see kumar @xcite ) .",
    "all these are clues that show that a model where the role of the disk self - gravity is fully incorporated is called for .",
    "note that if we adopt the numbers suggested by the data for we would find @xmath126 pc and @xmath127 ; then , it is curious to find that a self - regulated disk with these characteristics would have , for @xmath128 , a gradient of the rotation curve at @xmath129 pc compatible with @xmath130 .    on a completely different mass scale ,",
    "if we refer to the case of protostellar disks , typically quoted parameters are @xmath131 and @xmath132 ( hartmann et al .",
    "@xcite ) . under these circumstances",
    "we find @xmath133 au and @xmath134 .",
    "interestingly , protostellar disks have been observed to extend out to a radius from @xmath135 au to @xmath136 au ( dutrey et al .",
    "@xcite ; mccaughrean & odell @xcite ) . as for the case of agn s ,",
    "a check on the values of the temperatures anticipated on the basis of the effective thermal speeds predicted by the self - regulated models shows that the numbers fall reasonably within the range suggested by the observations .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note that studies of the _ spherical , inviscid _ collapse of a molecular cloud , imagined to eventually generate a system composed of a protostar and a circumstellar disk , lead to mass accretion rates @xmath137 ( hunter @xcite , shu @xcite ) , curiously analogous to those of our completely different accretion scenario .",
    "this coincidence may offer interesting clues for modeling the entire process where a cloud , starting out in an initially spherical collapse , ends up in a protostellar accretion disk .",

    "the standard non self - gravitating model , where the contribution of the gas density @xmath46 to the vertical gravitational field is negligible , corresponds to the limit equation @xmath162 .",
    "usually the analysis is carried out with the additional approximation @xmath163 , but this is not needed ; by retaining the contribution @xmath144 one can thus keep track of the effects associated with the rest of the disk mass distribution , which may be significant even where the local disk density @xmath164 is small . in any case , such limit equation yields the well known gaussian profile @xmath165 , with @xmath166 $ ] , here improved with respect to the standard expression @xmath167 used in the so - called keplerian limit .",
