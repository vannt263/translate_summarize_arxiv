    "harmonic generation ( hg ) from atoms ( lhuillier & balcou 1993 ) , molecules ( liang et al .",
    "1994 ) , clusters ( donelly et al .",
    "1996 ) , and solids ( von der linde et al .  1995 ) as a short - wavelength source is of great practical relevance . in recent years a huge amount of publications were devoted to `` harmonic engineering , '' under which we subsume either the study of phase matching during the propagation of the emitted light through gaseous media ( gaarde et al .",
    "1998 ) , generation of attosecond pulses using varying ellipticity ( antoine et al .  1997 ) , multi - color studies ( milosevic et al .",
    "2000 ) , or hg from thin crystals ( faisal & kaminski 1996 and 1997 ) .",
    "experimental results on hg from cyclic organic molecules were also reported in the literature ( hay et al .",
    "2000a and 2000b ) .",
    "however , the authors made no attempt to verify theoretically predicted selection rules . in the well established physical picture of hg one assumes that an electron tunnels out of the atom or ion , moves in the laser field and eventually rescatters with its parent ( or other ) ion where it might recombine  leading to an emission of a photon with several times the fundamental frequency ( becker et al .",
    "assuming such a viewpoint one can easily explain prominent features of hg spectra such as the famous cut - off at @xmath0 in the single atom case ( where @xmath1 is the ionization energy and @xmath2 is the ponderomotive energy , i.e. , the cycle - averaged quiver energy of the electron in the laser field ) . for a general overview on harmonic generation in laser fields see the recent review by salires et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .    fortunately , to derive the selection rules for harmonic emission only symmetry considerations are necessary ( alon et al .",
    "we now briefly summarize this approach .",
    "let us consider a hamiltonian which is periodic in time , i.e. , @xmath3 .",
    "such a hamiltonian might describe an electron in a _",
    "long _ laser pulse where the pulse envelope is sufficiently adiabatic .",
    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) reads ( we use atomic units @xmath4 throughout , if not noted otherwise ) _ ( , t ) = 0 . according to the floquet theorem ( see , e.g. , faisal 1987 )",
    "we can write @xmath5 with @xmath6 leading to the schrdinger equation _ f(t ) _ ( , t ) = _ ( , t ) , _ f(t)=(t)- with @xmath7 the so - called quasi energy and @xmath8 the floquet hamiltonian .",
    "since @xmath9 is periodic in time it might be expanded in a fourier series @xmath10 \\phi^{(n)}_\\energy(\\vektr)$ ] .",
    "this floquet approach is a well - known method in multiphoton physics ( gavrila 1992 ) and a widely used numerical simulation technique also ( potvliege 1998 ) . in order to derive the hg selection rules we now assume ( for reasons which will become clear soon ) that the system is in a single and non - degenerate floquet state @xmath11 .",
    "the hg spectra ( hgs ) peak no .",
    "@xmath12 is present only if the fourier transformed dipole moment @xmath13 does not vanish for the frequency @xmath14 , t ( -nt ) ^3 r ^*_(,t ) ( ) _ ( , t ) 0.[fourier ] now let us suppose we worked out a symmetry operation @xmath15 under which the floquet hamiltonian is invariant , @xmath16 .",
    "it follows that ( in the case of non - degenerated floquet states @xmath11 , see assumption above ) @xmath17 holds . here",
    "@xmath18 is a phase factor , @xmath19 . for convenience , we rewrite as _ ( ) ( -nt)_= _ ( ) ( -nt)_0where the double brackets indicate spatial _ and _ temporal integration [ this is the so - called extended hilbert space formalism , see , e.g. , sambe ( 1973 ) ] .",
    "the hg selection rule can be derived from @xmath20 = _ ( ) ( -nt)^-1_[step ] leading to ( ) ( -nt ) = ( ) ( -nt)^-1 .",
    "[ selection ] the last step in is not possible if @xmath11 is not a pure floquet state . in the next section",
    "we apply to derive the selection rule for hg from ring - shaped molecules . here , for the sake of illustration , we rederive the selection rule for a single atom with spherically symmetric potential @xmath21 and linearly ( in @xmath22-direction ) polarized laser field @xmath23 . the floquet hamiltonian @xmath24 is invariant under the transformation @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "if we look for harmonics polarized in the @xmath22-direction we have @xmath27 and from @xmath28 $ ] follows @xmath29 .",
    "therefore only odd harmonics are generated .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] we introduce our model and the selection rule which holds in its case . in section [ results ]",
    "we present and discuss our numerical results .",
    "finally , in section [ summ ] we give a summary and an outlook .",
    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) for a single electron in a laser field @xmath30 and under the influence of an ionic potential @xmath31 reads in dipole approximation and length gauge ( , t ) = ( -^2 + v ( ) + ( t ) ) ( , t ) .",
    "[ tdse.i ] the dipole approximation is excellent since in all the cases studied in this paper the wavelength of the laser light is much greater than the size of the molecule .",
    "if we force the electron to move along a ring of radius @xmath32 in the @xmath33-plane @xmath31 becomes @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the usual polar angle . with an electric field of the form @xmath36 $ ] , where @xmath37 is a slowly varying envelope , @xmath38 is the laser frequency , and @xmath39 is the ellipticity parameter , the tdse becomes effectively one - dimensional ( 1d ) in space and reads ( , t ) = ( - + v ( ) + ( t ) ) ( , t ) .",
    "[ tdse.ii ] in case of circularly polarized light ( @xmath40 ) this simplifies to ( , t ) = ( - + v ( ) + ( -t ) ) ( , t ) .",
    "[ tdse.iii ]    we now assume that the potential @xmath34 has an @xmath41-fold rotational symmetry , @xmath42 . then , with the help of , we can easily derive the selection rule for hg in the system described by the tdse .",
    "the transformation ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) leaves the corresponding floquet hamiltonian invariant . for , e.g. , anti - clockwise polarized emission @xmath45 holds , and",
    "from we have @xmath46\\exp[-\\imagi n \\omega ( t+2\\pi / n\\omega)]\\ ] ] leading to @xmath47 , @xmath48 . for the clockwise emission one",
    "finds accordingly @xmath49 .",
    "thus we expect pairs of hg peaks at @xmath50 ( alon et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the tdse or can be easily solved ab initio on a pc .",
    "we did this by propagating the wavefunction in time with a crank - nicholson approximant to the propagator @xmath51 $ ] where @xmath52 is the explicitly time - dependent hamiltonian corresponding to the tdse .",
    "our algorithm is fourth order in the grid spacing @xmath53 and second order in the time step @xmath54 .",
    "the boundary condition is @xmath55 for all times @xmath56 .",
    "we now present results from single active electron ( sae)-runs with @xmath57 ( bond length and radius of benzene c@xmath58h@xmath58 ) and an effective model potential v ( ) = - [ ( n ) + 1 ] [ pot ] with @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "this leads to an electronic ground state energy @xmath61 which is the experimental ionization potential for removing the first electron in benzene ( see , e.g. , talebpour et al .",
    "1998 and 2000 ) .",
    "note , that in our simple model we have no continuum but discrete states only .",
    "the first six excited states are located at @xmath62 ( two - fold degenerated ) , @xmath63 ( two - fold degenerated ) , @xmath64 ( non - degenerated ) , @xmath65 ( non - degenerated ) , @xmath66 ( two - fold degenerated ) , @xmath67 ( two - fold degenerated ) .",
    "the energy levels of our model resemble , apart from an overall downshift and the removal of degeneracies of certain states , those of the isoperimetric model where @xmath68 , the energy levels are given by @xmath69 , @xmath70 with the states @xmath71 two - fold degenerated .",
    "therefore , the energy level spacing , and thus typical electronic transitions , are different from those in real benzene . however , it is not our goal to present quantitatively correct results for laser benzene - interaction in this paper but we rather want to demonstrate some of the underlying principles of hg from ring - shaped molecules in general .    in fig .",
    "[ circandlin ] we present hgs for a @xmath72 cycle pulse of the shape @xmath73 with an electric field amplitude @xmath74  a.u .  and frequency @xmath75 . in fig .",
    "[ circandlin]a the result for linear polarization @xmath76 is shown , in fig .",
    "[ circandlin]b the result for circular polarization @xmath40 . to obtain those plots we evaluated the",
    "fourier transformed dipole in @xmath22-direction , i.e. , @xmath77 . in the @xmath76-case",
    "the dipole with respect to @xmath78 is clearly zero while in the circular case there is simply a phase shift of @xmath79 with respect to the dipole in @xmath22 .",
    "as expected , in the linearly polarized field all odd harmonics are emitted whereas in the circular case only the harmonics @xmath80 , @xmath81 are visible .",
    "other emission lines are many orders of magnitude weaker .",
    "those lines can form band - like structures which are interesting in itself . however , in this paper we focus only on the laser harmonics .",
    "they dominate the hgs , at least as long as no resonances are hit .    in fig .",
    "[ difffrequ ] the emitted yield of the fundamental and the first four harmonics ( 5th , 7th , 11th , 13th ) in a circularly polarized laser pulse are presented as a function of the laser frequency .",
    "the pulse length @xmath82  a.u .",
    "( corresponding to @xmath83  fs ) and peak field strength @xmath84  a.u.(corresponding to @xmath85  w/@xmath86 ) were held fixed .",
    "the frequency is plotted in units of the smallest level spacing of the model molecule , i.e. , the energy gap between first excited and ground state , which is in our case @xmath87 . for laser frequencies",
    "@xmath88 we do not find the 7th or higher harmonics .",
    "the 11th and 13th harmonic show an overall decrease with increasing laser frequency whereas the fundamental , the 5th and the 7th stay relatively constant in intensity .",
    "for frequencies @xmath89 there is a complicated dependency of the harmonic yield on @xmath38 .",
    "all harmonics show a local maximum around @xmath90 .",
    "however , at that frequency one apparently hits a resonance since the harmonic peaks become broad and show a substructure ( see left inlay in fig .",
    "[ difffrequ ] ) . in the interval @xmath91 the fundamental drops whereas the 7th harmonic increases in strength .",
    "note that the 7th harmonic is anti - clockwise polarized , like the incident laser field , whereas the 5th is polarized in the opposite direction . for frequencies",
    "@xmath92 the behavior becomes more smooth apart from another resonance near @xmath93 .",
    "in general , the hgs look clean for sufficiently high frequencies and far away from resonances ( like in the right inlay of fig .",
    "[ difffrequ ] ) . a rich substructure near resonances is visible in the hgs ( cf .",
    "inlay for @xmath94 ) .    in fig .  [ difffield ] harmonic yields for the fixed frequency @xmath95 as a function of the field amplitude @xmath96",
    "are shown .",
    "the higher harmonics ( 11th19th ) appear only for higher field strengths whereas fundamental , 5th and 7th are rather weakly dependent on the field strength .",
    "the anti - clockwise polarized harmonics ( polarized like the incident laser light , drawn thick ) tend to overtake the clockwise polarized ones ( drawn thin ) at higher laser intensities .",
    "however , @xmath97 corresponds already to a laser intensity @xmath98  w/@xmath86 where a real benzene molecule would probably break .",
    "it is interesting to study the scaling of the tdse with respect to the size of the molecule .",
    "if one scales the molecule radius like @xmath99 , the tdse remains invariant if @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 is chosen . from this and our numerical result that laser frequencies @xmath104 are preferable for clean hgs we learn that molecules bigger than benzene are more promising candidates for hg with realistic laser frequencies [ from nd ( @xmath105  a.u . ) to krf ( @xmath75  a.u . ) ] .",
    "one might object that electron correlation could spoil the selection rule because in reality it is not only a single electron which participates in the dynamics . however , alon et al .  (",
    "1998 ) have proven that this is not the case .",
    "this is due to the fact that _ ( i ) _ the electron interaction part of the hamiltonian is still invariant under the transformation @xmath15 , and _",
    "( ii ) _ @xmath15 commutes with the ( anti- ) symmetrization operator .",
    "even approximate theories or numerical techniques like time - dependent hartree - fock or density functional theory do not spoil the selection rule since they involve only functionals which depend on scalar products of single particle orbitals , all invariant under the transformation @xmath15 ( ceccherini & bauer 2001 ) .",
    "in this paper we demonstrated numerically hg from a model molecule with discrete rotational symmetry which is subject to a circularly polarized laser pulse .",
    "in particular the harmonic emission from an effectively 1d model with @xmath59 ( i.e. , a simple model for benzene ) as a function of laser frequency and intensity was discussed .",
    "it was found that for frequencies below the characteristic level spacing @xmath106 hg is strongly affected by resonances .",
    "the situation relaxes for higher frequencies . for the efficient generation of higher harmonics laser frequencies",
    "@xmath104 _ and _ rather strong fields are necessary . in such fields real aromatic compounds probably ionize and dissociate already .",
    "numerical studies for a more realistic , effectively 2d model molecule will be presented elsewhere ( ceccherini & bauer 2001 ) .    in order to obtain short wavelength radiation",
    "it is desirable to have either @xmath107 or @xmath41 in the selection rule @xmath50 as big as possible . from our numerical results",
    "we infer that it is probably hard to push efficiently towards high @xmath107 without destroying the target molecule . for that reason , in a real experiment nanotubes are promising candidates because @xmath41 can be of the order of 100 or more ( dresselhaus et al.1998 ) , and , moreover , hg should be even more efficient when the laser propagates through the tube . however , it remains the problem of the proper alignment of the laser beam and the symmetry axis of the molecule .",
    "crystals might be better candidates in that respect .",
