    "spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is one of the most important features in low energy qcd .",
    "the phenomena of the light pseudoscalar mesons ( the pion and its flavor partner ) , which are regarded as the approximate nambu - goldstone bosons associated with the symmetry breaking , are well described by the symmetry property in the low energy region .",
    "this chiral symmetry is expected to be restored in hot and/or dense matter and properties of hadrons will be changed near the critical point of the chiral symmetry restoration  @xcite .",
    "it is important to investigate the physics near the phase transition point both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "in fact , the cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) observed an enhancement of dielectron ( @xmath1 ) mass spectra below the @xmath2 resonance  @xcite .",
    "this can be explained by the dropping mass of the @xmath3 meson ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) following the brown - rho scaling proposed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) has started to measure several physical processes in hot matter which include the dilepton energy spectra .",
    "this will further clarify the properties of vector mesons in hot matter .",
    "therefore it is interesting to study the properties of the pion and vector mesons near the critical temperature , especially associated with the dropping mass of the vector meson .",
    "there is no strong restriction concerning vector meson masses in the standard scenario of chiral symmetry restoration , where the pion joins with the scalar meson in the same chiral representation [ see for example , refs .",
    "however there is a scenario which certainly requires the dropping mass of the vector meson and supports the brown - rho scaling : in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was proposed that there can be another possibility for the pattern of chiral symmetry restoration , named the vector manifestation ( vm ) .",
    "the vm was proposed as a novel manifestation of the chiral symmetry in the wigner realization , in which the chiral symmetry is restored by the massless degenerate pion ( and its flavor partners ) and the longitudinal @xmath3 meson ( and its flavor partners ) as the chiral partner . in terms of the chiral representations of the low - lying mesons , there is a representation mixing in the vacuum  @xcite .",
    "when we approach the critical point , there are two possibilities for the pattern of the chiral symmetry restoration : one possible pattern is the standard scenario and another is the vm .",
    "both of them are on an equal footing with each other in terms of the chiral representations .",
    "it is worthwhile to study the physics associated with the vm as well as that with the standard scenario of the chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "it has been shown that the vm is formulated at a large number of flavor  @xcite , critical temperature  @xcite and critical density  @xcite by using the effective field theory including both pions and vector mesons based on the hidden local symmetry ( hls )  @xcite , where a second order or weakly first order phase transition was assumed . in the vm at finite temperature and/or density ,",
    "the _ intrinsic temperature and/or density dependences _ of the parameters of the hls lagrangian played important roles to realize the chiral symmetry restoration consistently : in the framework of the hls the equality between the axial vector and vector current correlators at the critical point can be satisfied only if the intrinsic thermal and/or density effects are included .",
    "the intrinsic temperature and/or density dependences are nothing but the information converted from the underlying qcd through the wilsonian matching  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the predictions of the vm were made on the pion velocity and the vector and axial vector susceptibilities .",
    "it was stressed that the vector mesons in addition to the pseudoscalar mesons become relevant degrees of freedom near the critical temperature .    in this paper",
    "we shed some light on the validity of the vector dominance ( vd ) in hot matter .",
    "in several analyses such as the one on the dilepton spectra in hot matter carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the vd is assumed to be held even in the high temperature region .",
    "there are several analyses resulting in the dropping mass consistent with the vd , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the analysis done in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the thermal vector meson mass goes up if the vd holds .",
    "thus , it is interesting to study what the vm predicts on the vd . in the present analysis we present a new prediction of the vm in hot matter on the direct photon-@xmath0-@xmath0 coupling which measures the validity of the vd of the electromagnetic form factor of the pion .",
    "we find that _ the vm predicts a large violation of the vd at the critical temperature_. this indicates that the assumption of the vd may need to be weakened , at least in some amounts , for consistently including the effect of the dropping mass of the vector meson .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : hls ] , we show the hls lagrangian which we use in the present analysis . in section  [ sec : tpfbfg ] , we present an entire list of the hadronic thermal corrections to the two - point functions including the vector and pseudoscalar meson loop contributions in the background field gauge .",
    "we think that it is useful to summarize the entire list of the hadronic thermal corrections since only the relevant part of them was listed in ref .  @xcite . in section  [ sec : ite ] , we first give an account of the general idea of the intrinsic thermal and/or dense effects , which was not explicitly stated before .",

    "[ sec : pavvd ] , we presented a new prediction associated with the validity of vector dominance ( vd ) in hot matter . in the hls model at zero temperature , the wilsonian matching predicts @xmath375  @xcite which guarantees the vd of the electromagnetic form factor of the pion . even at non - zero temperature ,",
    "this is valid as long as we consider the thermal effects in the low temperature region , where the intrinsic temperature dependences are negligible .",
    "we showed that , as a consequence of including the intrinsic effect , the vd is largely violated at the critical temperature : @xmath376 in general , full temperature dependences include both hadronic and intrinsic thermal effects .",

    "several comments are in order :    the unitarity of the scalar channel of @xmath0-@xmath0 scattering will be broken around 400 - 500 mev in the present model although the existence of the @xmath3 meson helps a little , as was studied in ref .",
    "the unitarity of the vector sector , on the other hand , is not violated due to the existence of the vector mesons .",

    "it is also important to study the screening mass of the vector meson which is determined from the vector current correlator as done in the lattice calculation .",
