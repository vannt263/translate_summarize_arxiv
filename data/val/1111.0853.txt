    "one of the most fundamental tasks in quantum mechanics is that of quantum state tomography , i.e. , reliably reconstructing an unknown quantum state from measurements . specifically in the context of quantum information processing in most experiments one has to eventually show what state had actually been prepared . yet",
    ", surprisingly little attention has so far been devoted to the observation that standard methods of quantum state tomography scale very badly with the system size .",
    "only quite recently , novel more efficient methods have been introduced which solve this problem in a more favorable way in the number of measurement settings that need to be performed @xcite .",
    "this development is more timely than ever , given that the experimental progress with controlled quantum systems such as trapped ions is so rapid that traditional methods of state reconstruction will fail : e.g. , @xmath0 ions can already be controlled in their quantum state @xcite .",
    "hence , further experimental progress appears severely challenged as long as ideas of reconstruction can not keep up .",
    "such new methods are based on ideas of quantum compressed sensing @xcite  inspired by recent work on low - rank matrix completion @xcite  or on ideas of approximating unknown quantum states with matrix - product states @xcite . indeed ,",
    "using methods of quantum compressed sensing , one can reduce the number of measurement settings from @xmath1 in standard methods to @xmath2 for a quantum system with hilbert space dimension @xmath3 , if the state is of rank @xmath4 .",
    "this is efficient in the sense that the number of measurements required is only slightly greater ( by an @xmath5 factor ) than the number of degrees of freedom in the unknown state .",
    "these ideas have so far been tailored to the situation where observables are taken from an orthonormal operator basis , which is not always the natural situation at hand . in this paper",
    ", we introduce a theory of state reconstruction based on quantum compressed sensing that allows for continuous families of measurements , referred to as _ tight frames _ , which can be thought of over - complete , non - orthogonal generalization of operator bases .",
    "these settings are particularly important in the context of continuous - variables , which are notably used to describe quantum optical systems beyond the single - photon regime .",
    "these have drawn a considerable amount of research , both experimentally and theoretically , due to very desired features such as easy preparation and highly efficient detection .",
    "note that when talking about a measurement , we always mean the estimation of an expectation value of an observable for which , of course , several repetition of some experimental procedure are necessary . in this paper",
    "we are mainly concerned with the number of distinct observables or _",
    "measurement settings _ that are needed for tomography .    in this work ,",
    "we make significant progress towards a full theory of efficient state reconstruction via compressed sensing :    1 .",
    "we introduce _ new incoherence properties _ for tight frames , that are sufficient to ensure efficient compressed sensing for low - rank states .",
    "this uses an extension of the `` golfing '' proof technique of @xcite .",
    "we give examples of tight frames that satisfy these properties .",
    "in addition , we show that , if one only wishes to reconstruct `` typical '' or `` generic '' low - rank states , there is a much larger class of tight frames that also lead to efficient compressed sensing .",
    "we also describe a way to _ certify _ a successful reconstruction of the state , making our protocol unconditional and heralded . in this way",
    ", one does not need to make any a priori assumptions on the unknown state .",
    "our method uses convex duality , and is different from other approaches to certification that focus mainly on pure states @xcite .",
    "also , we discuss the _ robustness _ of the procedure under decoherence , imperfect measurements , and statistical noise . we show that , as long as all those effects are small , it is possible to certify that the reconstructed state is close to the true state .",
    "we show that , using an incoherent tight frame , and a slightly larger number of measurements , one can achieve _",
    "universal _ state reconstruction : a single fixed set of measurements can simultaneously distinguish among all possible low - rank states .",
    "this is a qualitatively stronger claim than those shown above , and it is obtained using a different technique , based on the `` restricted isometry property '' ( rip ) @xcite .",
    "this implies strong error bounds , showing that our procedure for state reconstruction is robust to statistical noise , and that it works even when the true state is full - rank with rapidly decaying eigenvalues ( in which case our procedure returns a low - rank approximation to the true state ) .",
    "we show how our theory can be applied in realistic experimental scenarios , involving pointwise measurements of the wigner function , and homodyne detection .",
    "we demonstrate _ numerically _ that compressed sensing outperforms the naive approach to tomography not only in the asymptotic limit of large systems but also for system sizes commonly accessible in present day experiments .",
    "this article is organized as follows : we start by introducing quantum compressed sensing in the general setting described by tight frames in section 2 . after discussing a suitable notion of efficiency ,",
    "we show in section 3 that efficient compressed sensing is possible if the tight frame fulfills certain incoherence properties .",
    "section 4 is devoted to certified compressed sensing .",
    "we discuss how to certify the success of the reconstruction without prior assumptions on the tight frame , both in the ideal case and under the effects of errors . in section 5",
    "we show universal state reconstruction and error bounds . in section 6 , we investigate applications of the formalism to two common classes of quantum optical experiments ; and in section 7 , numerical data , showing the efficiency for small systems , is presented .",
    "consider a quantum system with hilbert space dimension @xmath3 . in most cases of interest",
    ", @xmath3 is very large , but the states one wants to reconstruct are approximately low - rank , that is , they are well - approximated by density matrices having rank @xmath6 .",
    "( pure states correspond to the case where @xmath7 . )",
    "when dealing with continuous - variable systems , we will truncate the infinite - dimensional hilbert space and choose @xmath3 to be some large but finite cutoff .",
    "this is unavoidable , if one wants to do tomography as one can not reconstruct a state that contains an infinite number of completely independent parameters .",
    "however , in most experimentally relevant situations , e.g. , continuous - variable light modes with finite mean energy , all states can be arbitrarily well approximated by finite - dimensional ones .",
    "we will elaborate on this claim when discussing other sources of errors such as decoherence or imperfect measurements .",
    "compressed sensing contains two key ideas .",
    "first , rather than measuring all @xmath8 degrees of freedom , it is sufficient to measure a randomly chosen subset of about @xmath9 degrees of freedom , provided these degrees of freedom satisfy certain _",
    "incoherence properties_. secondly , one can reconstruct the state using an efficient algorithm .",
    "the obvious approach of searching for the lowest - rank state compatible with the measurement results leads to a computationally intractable problem ( generally np - hard ) .",
    "instead , one can perform a _ convex relaxation _ , and minimize @xmath10 instead of the rank . here",
    "@xmath11 stands for the schatten @xmath12-norm : @xmath10 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are respectively the trace norm , frobenius norm , and spectral ( or operator ) norm .",
    "let us denote the @xmath15 measured observables , i.e.  hermitian matrices , by @xmath16 , and suppose that we estimate their expectation values ( by measuring many copies of the unknown state ) .",
    "knowing these expectation values ( for an unknown state @xmath17 ) is equivalent to knowing the value of the _ sampling operator _ @xmath18 , where we define @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the hilbert - schmidt scalar product . in all of our compressed sensing schemes ,",
    "@xmath16 will be chosen independently at random from some distribution @xmath21 .",
    "the sampling operator @xmath22 is a linear super - operator on the @xmath23-dimensional real vector space of hermitian matrices , or operators , @xmath24 .",
    "such super - operators will always be denoted by capital script letters .",
    "sometimes we will use the notation @xmath25 , multiplying the `` matrix '' @xmath22 by the `` vector '' @xmath26 ; this means the same thing as @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath17 be the unknown state .",
    "in the ideal case , with perfect measurements and no statistical noise , we measure @xmath18 exactly .",
    "then the procedure to reconstruct @xmath17 can be written as @xmath28 note that a quantum state @xmath17 is a hermitian matrix with the additional properties @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "however , the reconstruction procedure ( [ eq : reconstruction ] ) does not make use of this property and is , therefore , also applicable in more general settings , e.g.  matrix completion .",
    "this problem can be stated as a semi - definite program ( sdp ) and , therefore , solved efficiently with many well - developed tools .    in the case of noisy data , we measure @xmath18 approximately , that is , we measure some @xmath31 such that @xmath32 , for some norm @xmath33 and tolerance @xmath34 that are chosen depending on the kind of noise that is expected . the constraint @xmath35 in ( [ eq : reconstruction ] ) can then be replaced by @xmath36 , which implies @xmath37 .",
    "we remark that equation ( [ eq : reconstruction ] ) is the key to certifying our estimate for @xmath17 .",
    "notice that if the solution @xmath38 of ( [ eq : reconstruction ] ) is unique and fulfills @xmath39 , then it must be the case that @xmath40 .",
    "we will show later on how one can test the uniqueness of the solution @xmath38 , without assuming anything about @xmath17 .",
    "( this can be adapted to work with noisy data , without assuming anything about the noise . )      when we talk about a compressed sensing scheme , we mean any protocol based on the reconstruction procedure ( [ eq : reconstruction ] ) , with _ some _ choice of measurements described by the sampling operator ( [ eq : rdef ] ) . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the observables were required to be chosen uniformly at random from an operator basis .",
    "we substantially generalize these techniques , using the notion of a tight frame , which naturally captures many useful quantum measurements :    let @xmath21 be a probability measure on some set @xmath41 , and for every [ def : tfcondition ] @xmath42 , let @xmath43 be an observable , i.e. , a hermitian operator , and let @xmath44 be the ( unnormalized ) orthogonal projector which acts as @xmath45 .",
    "we say that @xmath46 is a tight frame if @xmath47    this can also be written as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is drawn according to @xmath21 . because we deal with randomly drawn operators very often",
    ", @xmath49 will usually denote a random element of @xmath41 that has distribution @xmath21 .",
    "note that we do not require that @xmath50 for all @xmath49 as it will be convenient in many applications .",
    "however , we do require a weaker normalization condition : @xmath51 = 1 $ ] which follows by taking the trace of ( [ eq : tfcondition ] ) .",
    "we also define a generalized notion of a tight frame , where the sampling operator is not a sum of projectors ; we will need this later to model homodyne detection on optical modes , where a single measurement setting provides more information than only one expectation value .",
    "[ def : tfcondition2 ] let @xmath21 be a probability measure on some set @xmath41 , and for every @xmath42 let @xmath52 be a positive operator .",
    "we say that @xmath53 forms a generalized tight frame if @xmath54    we note that the formalism can be also applied to 8-port homodyne detection which corresponds , for a single mode , to projections on coherent states @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "for @xmath17 to be the unique solution to ( [ eq : reconstruction ] ) , any deviation @xmath57 must be either trace - norm increasing , i.e. , @xmath58 , or infeasible , i.e. , @xmath59 .",
    "this is done by decomposing @xmath57 into a sum @xmath60 , and then showing that , with high probability , in the case where @xmath61 is large , @xmath57 must be infeasible , while in the case where @xmath61 is small , @xmath57 must be trace - norm increasing . here , we denote by @xmath62 the real space of hermitian matrices that send the kernel of @xmath17 on its image . in other words ,",
    "the elements of @xmath62 are the hermitian matrices @xmath26 whose restriction on and to the kernel of @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the orthogonal projection on @xmath65 , is equal to @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath67 denotes the projection on this space @xmath62 .",
    "again , in the actual reconstruction , no assumptions have to be made concerning @xmath17 or @xmath62 .",
    "theorem  [ lem : certified ] gives a sufficient condition for uniqueness .",

    "a common situation is that the system under consideration consists of @xmath87 subsystems with local hilbert space dimension @xmath88 ; then @xmath89 .",
    "of course , no method of tomography can counter the exponential growth of the required number of measurements in @xmath87 .",
    "thus , efficiency needs to be regarded relative to the @xmath1 measurements necessary for standard tomography . as even a pure state needs @xmath90 parameters to be described ,",
    "this also is a lower bound to the number of observables that need to be measured .",
    "we allow for an additional polylogarithmic overhead and define efficiency as follows :    [ def : efficient ] compressed sensing for a state @xmath17 ( with dimension @xmath3 and rank @xmath4 ) is regarded as efficient if : the number of measured observables satisfies @xmath91 , and the probability of failure satisfies @xmath92 .",
    "if this is the case , @xmath86 can be made arbitrarily small by repeating the protocol and using a majority vote among the reconstructed states to get the final result .",

    "( [ eq : pointwisewigdef ] ) allows pointwise measurement of the wigner function by a displacement in phase space followed by a measurement of the parity of the photon number .",
    "this has already been experimentally performed for optical fields in a cavity @xcite and for pulsed single photons ( for the special case of a rotationally invariant state ) @xcite .",
