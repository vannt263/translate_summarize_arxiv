    "small aperture ( @xmath9 ) telephoto - lens telescopes , combined with the new generation of commercial ccd cameras , can be valuable instruments to search for low - surface - brightness stellar systems , such as new dwarf companions ( merritt , van dokkum & abraham 2014 ; javanmardi al . 2015 ; karachentsev et al . 2015 ; romanowski et al . 2015 ) and stellar tidal streams ( martnez - delgado et al . 2008 ; 2010 ) around nearby spiral galaxies , and ultra - diffuse galaxies in galaxy clusters ( van dokkum et al .",
    ". the short focal ratio of these telescopes allows one to trace these faint stellar systems as unresolved , diffuse light structures with surface brightness below @xmath10 well beyond the local group , up to distances of @xmath11 , exploring the low - surface - brightness regime of the scaling relations for early - type galaxies .",
    "in addition , the single , photographic - film sized chip from such amateur ccd cameras coupled with short focal ratio small telescopes can probe extensive sky areas with unprecedented depth , reaching surface brightness levels that are @xmath12 magnitudes deeper ( @xmath13 ) than both the classic photographic plate surveys ( e.g. , the palomar observatory sky survey ) and the available large - scale digital surveys ( e.g. the sdss ) .",
    "this offers an alternative and low cost approach for the discovery of low surface brightness galaxies , which may lurk in those regions where the detection efficiency of the available large - scale imaging surveys drops to very small values .",
    "recently , van dokkum et al .",
    "( 2015 ) identified 47 low - surface - brightness galaxies in the direction of the coma cluster using the dragonfly telephoto array .",
    "although they have only obtained a direct distance for one of these galaxies ( van dokkum et al .",
    "2015b ) , their spatial distribution suggests that they are associated with the coma cluster .",
    "some of these coma galaxies have a similar size as the milky way ( which has an effective radius of @xmath14 ; bovy & rix 2013 ) , but they are significantly redder and more diffuse .",
    "they are also fainter than typical low - surface - brightness galaxies ( @xmath15 ; bothun et al .",
    "1997 ) , and much larger than local group dwarf galaxies ( e.g. the effective radius of and  xix , the most extended of the local group early - type satellites , is @xmath16 ; mcconnachie et al . 2008 ) .",
    "these authors dubbed these galaxies ultra - diffuse galaxies ( udgs ) and defined their key properties to include effective radii greater than @xmath17 and central @xmath18-band ( @xmath19-band ) surface brightness fainter than @xmath20 .",
    "although rare , there have been some detections of similar objects in the past .",
    "caldwell et al .",
    "( 2006 ) studied two galaxies with similar properties based on their initial discovery by impey et al .",
    "based on the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) distances , these two galaxies are in the core of the virgo cluster .",
    "both have an effective radius of @xmath21 and a central @xmath19-band surface brightness of @xmath22 . more recent deep imaging surveys of the virgo cluster ( ferrarese et al .",
    "2012 ; mihos et al .",
    "2015 ) and the fornax cluster ( muoz et al . 2015 ) have also revealed the presence of faint systems with properties analogous to the udgs , suggesting that they could belong to a new morphological class of galaxy with the sizes of the giants but the luminosities of the dwarfs .",
    "the origin of these ultra - diffuse galaxies is not clear .",
    "whether they are only found in clusters or whether they also exist in isolation is still an open question that when answered will provide important clues about their formation .",
    "van dokkum et al . (",
    "2015 ) noted that the spatial distribution of their 47 udgs avoided the central regions of the coma cluster , although this apparent location may be an observational selection effect .",
    "the large physical sizes of udg galaxies compared their low stellar masses suggest that they must be dark matter dominated to survive within dense cluster environments .",
    "if large numbers of udgs are found in a range of environments , they may contribute meaningfully to the ` missing satellite ' problem ( e.g. , moore et al .",
    "1999 ) .    during the commissioning of our new project to search for faint satellites around the local group spiral galaxies and other nearby systems with amateur telescopes ( the dgsat survey ; see javanmardi et al .",
    "2015 ) , we found an apparently isolated , faint galaxy within the projected extent of the m31 stellar halo , which had been missed by previous surveys that relied on either resolved star counts or the hi 21 cm - radio line for galaxy detection .",
    "although it was initially interpreted as an interesting case of an isolated dwarf spheroidal galaxy , our follow - up spectroscopic observations confirm that this galaxy is at a distance similar to that of the pisces - perseus supercluster of galaxies that is in the background of this field of the m31 stellar halo .",
    "the properties that we obtain for this background system are very similar to those of the ultra - diffuse galaxies recently reported by the dragonfly team ( van dokkum et al .",
    "2015 ) .    in section 2 of this paper",
    "we describe the discovery of the galaxy and our observing strategy . in section 3",
    "we detail the photometric and spectroscopic properties that we measure for this galaxy . in section 4",
    "we discuss the possible nature of dgsat  i  as an ultra - diffuse galaxy and speculate about its possible origin .",
    "dgsat  i  was found in a visual inspection of a full color image of the andromeda  ii dwarf galaxy available on the internet and taken by the amateur astronomer alessandro maggi using a takahashi epsilon 180ed astrograph ( @xmath23 diameter at @xmath24 ) .",
    "the detection was confirmed by follow - up observations using the amateur and professional facilities described below .",
    "the position of the center of this new dwarf galaxy lies at @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the first dataset was collected with a 15-cm aperture @xmath27 takahashi toa-150 refractor telescope located at the fosca nit observatory ( fno ) at the montsec astronomical park ( ager , spain ) .",
    "we used a stl-11000 m ccd camera with a large fov ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) .",
    "a set of individual @xmath30 ( luminance - filter ) images were obtained in photometric nights between august and september 2012 , with a total integration of 43,800 seconds .",
    "each sub - exposure was reduced following standard procedures for dark subtraction , bias correction , and flat fielding .",
    "deeper imaging of the field was acquired with a 0.4-m aperture , @xmath31 corrected newton telescope located at the remote observatory southern alps ( rosa , verclause , france ) in august 2013 .",
    "we used a fli ml16803 ccd detector , which provides a total field of @xmath32 with a scale of @xmath33 .",
    "the total exposure time in the luminance filter was @xmath34 and the images were reduced using the same standard procedure .    both images obtained to confirm the discovery of dgsat  i   are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the luminance images taken with these amateur telescopes were first astrometrically calibrated @xcite , and then calibrated to the sdss - dr7 @xcite photometric system . to begin the flux calibration of both images , we remove any residual large - scale sky gradients in our wide - field images by modeling the background using a two - dimensional , fourth - order legendre polynomial that was fitted to the median flux in coarse pixel bins after masking all sources that were detected above the background at @xmath35 level .",
    "the bins were typically 5  on a side .",
    "we then located 67 isolated stars distributed throughout each image with sdss @xmath36-band magnitude @xmath37 , and performed aperture photometry on them .",
    "the same set of stars was measured in both images .",
    "the positions of these stars were matched with the sdss dr7 catalog , from which we retrieved their @xmath18 , @xmath36 and @xmath38 magnitudes . from these data ,",
    "a linear relation between the @xmath36 magnitude and the luminance instrumental magnitude was derived individually for each image .",
    "we find that the residuals from this relation are a strong linear function of @xmath39 color and vary by 0.5 mag over the color range @xmath40 .",
    "once this color term was corrected , the statistical uncertainty in the flux calibration is only @xmath41 . the @xmath42 limiting surface brightness for background variations measured following the procedure of cooper et al .",
    "( 2011 ; see their appendix ) is @xmath43 and @xmath44 for the toa-150 and 0.4-m @xmath45 data , respectively , as determined by measuring the standard deviation of the median of random 20  apertures placed around each image .",
    "this means that the toa-150 imaging is @xmath46 deeper than the rosa 0.4-m data in terms of photon statistics , and its sensitivity to large - scale surface brightness variations is less hindered due to the better quality of the flatfielding .",
    "we use a deep image of the field around the and  ii dsph obtained with the subaru / suprimecam wide field imager ( @xmath47 fov , @xmath48 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is publicly available from the smoka archive @xcite .",
    "these observations include dithered exposures of @xmath49 in the subaru @xmath19-band and @xmath50 in the subaru @xmath51-band with a seeing around 06 @xcite .",
    "preprocessing of the data was done by debiasing , trimming , flat fielding , and gain correcting each individual exposure chip - by - chip using median stacks of nightly sky flats .",
    "the presence of scattered light due to bright stars both in and out of the field of view required removing this smoothly varying component before performing photometry and solving for a world coordinate system solution . to remove scattered light , we fitted the smoothly varying component by creating a flat for every chip within each frame by performing a running median with a box size of 300 pixels .",
    "this was then subtracted from the original , unsmoothed frame to produce a final image for photometric processing .",
    "the resulting subaru @xmath19-band image is given in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "photometric calibration was performed using the daophot  ii and allstar @xcite packages .",
    "sources were detected in the @xmath19-band image by requiring a @xmath52-excess above the local background , with the list of detections being subsequently used for the allstar run on the @xmath51-band image . to obtain clean cmds and minimize the contamination by faint background galaxies , sources with the ratio estimator of the pixel - to - pixel scatter @xmath53 and sharpness parameters",

    "the dispersion solution provided an accuracy of the wavelength calibration of @xmath67 . because our object is of very low surface brightness , accurate subtraction of night sky lines is critical for the correct determination of its radial velocity .",
    "the sky background subtraction and correction of the spectrum curvature were done using the _ background _ task in iraf .",
    "finally , one - dimensional spectra were extracted from the two - dimensional ones and summed .",

    "images in @xmath4+[nii ] and in the continuum were obtained on october 26 , 2013 by observing the galaxies through a narrow band @xmath4 filter ( @xmath72 ) with an effective wavelength of 6555 , and the sed607 ( with @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) and sed707 ( with @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) intermediate band filters for the continuum .",
    "the exposure times were @xmath77 in the continuum and @xmath78 in @xmath4 .",
    "a standard procedure for analysis of direct ccd images was used for processing the data .",

    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the cmd of a selected region of @xmath80 from the subaru field ( corrected for galactic extinction a@xmath81=0.27 ) with rgb stars from the halo of m31 and some galactic foreground stars at @xmath82 .",
    "based on the densely populated cmds from the pandas survey @xcite of m31 s halo ( e.g. , figure  4 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we selected stars with @xmath83 for our sample , eliminating most of the galactic foreground population but still keeping most of the stars in m31 s halo and potential resolved stellar sources in the dwarf galaxy . using a similar color criterion as conn et al .",
    "( 2012 ) to select putative rgb stars in the satellite candidate ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) , we find that only 17 stars fall in this area of the cmd and within 40  of the center of the galaxy , consistent with the average density of stars within these color cuts in the image . hence , no significant over - density of resolved rgb stars is found at the location of dgsat  i  that would indicate it is a dwarf satellite of m31 .",
    "this is consistent with the lack of detection of this object in the list of over - density candidates in this region of andromeda from the pandas survey @xcite .",
    "thus , we conclude that the galaxy is not resolved into stars .",
    "this further rejects the possibility that dgsat  i  is a companion of the more distant spiral galaxy ngc  404 that is 275 distant in projection ( @xmath84 mpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is also very unlikely that it is a dwarf member of any other galaxy group in the background of m31 in the local universe ( e.g. ngc  672 with 5 known companions or ngc  891 with 18 known companions ) .      to derive radial velocities of our object we used : a ) the _ fxcor _ task in iraf ; and b ) the ulyss program @xcite with vazdekis et al.s ( 2010 ) ssp model , the salpeter imf ( salpeter 1955 ) and the miles stellar library @xcite .",
    "the task _ fxcor _ uses the fourier cross - correlation method developed by tonry & davis ( 1979 ) .",
    "the resulting radial velocity is @xmath85 .",
    "the cross - correlation peak is weak and the velocity error is large because of the low @xmath86 in the spectrum .",

    "the variation of the measured velocity and instrumental velocity dispersion as a function of wavelength ( koleva et al .",
    "the lsf was approximated by comparing a model spectrum of the sun to twilight spectra taken during the same night as the studied object .",
    "the result is @xmath5 . using the prescriptions of tully et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , we transform our initial measured velocity to one relative to the motion of the local group and obtain @xmath87 .",
    "this radial velocity corresponds to the hubble distance of @xmath88 for @xmath89 .",
    "the estimated velocity dispersion in the galaxy is @xmath90 .",
    "the @xmath91 value is very approximate given the low @xmath86 in the spectrum of dgsat  i  and needs to be verified at higher resolution and at higher s / n .",
    "interestingly , this velocity is consistent with those of the pisces - perseus supercluster , which has typical velocities in the range of @xmath92 .",
    "figure  5 shows the position of dgsat  i , clearly overlapping a prominent filament of this supercluster in this sky region ( wegner , haynes & giovanelli 1993 ) and in proximity to some of the massive members of this structure ( ngc 383 and ngc 507 , at projected distances of 2 - 3 mpc ) .",
    "therefore dgsat  i  could well be part of this structure , lending support to our redshift distance estimate , with a corresponding diameter ( effective size ) near @xmath93 ( see next section ) .",
    "its simultaneous low surface brightness ( @xmath94 ) and large physical extent would place it in the category of the _ ultra - diffuse _ galaxies ( see sec .",
    "the structural parameters of the dwarf galaxy were determined by running galfit3  @xcite on the sky - subtracted subaru @xmath19- and @xmath51-band images , with foreground and background objects removed .",
    "we characterize the photometric properties of the galaxy by using galfit3  to fit a two - dimensional srsic  profile , @xmath95 \\\\   i_c = i(0 ) & = & f_\\mathrm{tot } \\ ; \\left[2\\pi   q n \\left(r_e",
    "b_n^{-n}\\right)^2 \\gamma(2n ) \\right]^{-1 } \\ ; ,     \\label{eqn : sersic }       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the surface brightness within ellipses with semi - major axes @xmath96 , and @xmath97 is the gamma function .",
    "the conversion to the magnitude system ( see table  1 ) is given by @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the magnitude zero - point and @xmath100 the central surface brightness . the total flux @xmath101 ( expressed as magnitude , @xmath102 ) , the effective radius @xmath103 , srsic  index @xmath104 , and axis ratio @xmath105 are adjustable parameters .",
    "the constant @xmath106 is determined by the requirement @xmath107 .",
    "the geometry of the light distribution is additionally characterized by the location of the profile center and the position angle of the semi - major axis .",
    "we perform masking of intervening objects ( mostly foreground stars ) and background subtraction iteratively with sextractor  @xcite in the area where we fit our model ( @xmath108 ) , and add user - defined masked regions around the brightest stars . in order to obtain the background reliably",
    ", we also mask the target galaxy generously `` by hand '' . after a first pass of simultaneous object detection and background estimation",
    ", the task is repeated with the previously detected objects masked , which gives us a more accurate local background level and background noise , and thus also a more complete object mask . finally , by reapplying sextractor  on the galfit  residual image , we eventually also mask previously undetected objects that overlap with our target .",
    "the noise map , which enters the @xmath109 computation during fitting , was constructed by measuring the noise in the background and adding in quadrature the poisson noise of the sources . in lieu of including the sky background as a free parameter in the galfit  model , which can induce degeneracy in the output model parameters , we subtract the background from the image before fitting .",
    "lastly , to account for the effect of seeing and telescope optics , we construct a model image of the psf using several bright , unsaturated foreground stars near the position of dgsat  i  in the image .",
    "this empirically derived psf model is convolved with the galfit  model before comparison to the image data .",
    "we first fit a 2d - srsic  profile as a basic model of the @xmath19- and @xmath51-light distribution of dgsat  iin this simple model , we find dgsat  i  is almost circular ( @xmath110 ) with a shallow , sub - exponential inner profile ( @xmath111 ) , both of which are typical structural characteristics for galaxies of dwarf spheroidal morphology . however , despite the overall agreement of the model with the data ( see figure  6 ) , the data show two peculiarities with respect to the smooth regular srsic  model .    first , there is a faint , fuzzy irregularly - shaped elongated over - density of @xmath112 length near , but not coinciding with , the galaxy center ( offset by @xmath113 ) .",
    "apart from its shape , the over - density also differs from the main body of the galaxy by its bluer color , more specifically @xmath114 for the over - density as compared to @xmath115 for a regions at a similar radius within dgsat  i. due to its small angular size and the spatial resolution of our ground - based imaging , it is not possible to shed additional light on the nature of the blue over - density at this time ( see also sec .",
    "it could be an unresolved clump of young stars overlapping the smooth ( and possibly older ) component of the galaxy , similar to those observed in some nearby dirr galaxies ( e.g. sextans a , that contains a conspicuous , off - center star formation region ; dohm - palmer et al .",
    "1997 ) . alternatively , dgsat  i could be a nucleated udgs , similar to those found in the virgo cluster ( mihos et al .",
    "2015 ; beasley et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "for this reason , we construct three galfit3  models that differ in how this blue off - center over - density is treated .",
    "model 1 assumes that it should be included in the fit , and leaves it unmasked .",
    "model 2 also leaves it unmasked , but accounts for it as an additional structural component with fully independent parameters from the main body of the galaxy ( i.e. , both the general parameters and those specific to the srsicfit ) . in model 3 we exclude the over - density from the fit by masking it .",
    "table  1 compares the resulting parameters of the main component ( the sole component in model 1 and model 3 ) .",
    "parameters generally vary only mildly between these models , by @xmath116 for @xmath117 , @xmath103 and @xmath105 .",
    "differences in the best - fit @xmath118 and @xmath104 are more pronounced ( @xmath119 ) as they more specifically reflect the central profile .",
    "another peculiarity in the light distribution of dgsat  is its significant lopsidedness : the center of the innermost isophotes are offset from those of the outermost isophotes by several arcseconds to the north - west .",
    "we accommodate for the apparent lopsidedness by allowing a first - order fourier mode in the model isophotes .",
    "the best - fit amplitude of the mode is 0.21 ( 0.15 ) in @xmath19-band ( @xmath51-band ) .",
    "although allowing for the fourier mode in a single - component system is not essential to obtain accurate flux and scale parameters , this modification to the model is useful for us since it provides a measurement of the galaxy center and a realistic set of isophotes , which we utilize to measure the surface brightness profile @xmath120 with the iraf task _ ellipse _ ( see below ) .",
    "when measuring @xmath120 on the data image , we use the isophotes of the model . fitting the isophote geometry simultaneously with @xmath120 ( which was done on the model image )",
    "is impeded at small radii due to the low central surface brightness , the extremely shallow central gradient , and the irregularities introduced by the off - center over - density and remaining small contaminants .",
    "for the following discussion of the dgsat  i properties , we select model  3 ( where the over - density is masked ) as our adopted model .",
    "we do not base this selection on the value of @xmath109 at the best - fit parameters , since it is very similar for all three models considered of different models generally does not provide statistically well - defined quantitative evidence for intercomparison of models ] .",
    "we assume that , given its different color and presumably younger population , this over - density is a peculiar feature of dgsat  i and its light is not reflective of the global properties ( including the stellar mass ) at same confidence as as in the smooth , red component of the galaxy .",
    "rough _ estimate of the flux and size of this over - density can be obtained from the extra - component fitted in model 2 , yielding 2.5% flux fraction in the @xmath19-band ( 1.1% in the @xmath51-band ) , and 22% of the effective radius ( both bands ; see table 2 ) .",
    "the apparent galaxy parameters ( table 1 , column for `` model 3 '' ) translate to physical parameters using our adopted redshift distance of @xmath121 .",
    "the extinction - corrected apparent @xmath51-band magnitude of @xmath122 implies an absolute magnitude , @xmath123 , and , adopting @xmath124=4.1 ( binney & merrifield 1998 ) , a luminosity @xmath125 . in the @xmath19-band",
    ", we obtain @xmath126 , which implies an absolute magnitude , @xmath127 and , with @xmath128 , @xmath129 . at the same time",
    ", the effective radius of @xmath130 translates to @xmath131 .",
    "there is some uncertainty in @xmath103 , both due to the variation with band as well as due to background uncertainty ; we give here the maximum range of @xmath103 resulting from fitting different models _ and _ both bands ( see above and table 1 ) , which is @xmath132 , hence @xmath133 or @xmath134 maximum range in @xmath103 .",
    "thus , this galaxy is very extended ( about milky - way sized ; bovy & rix 2013 ) for its luminosity ( which is less than 1/100 of the milky way ) .      in order to estimate the stellar mass of dgsat  i we use the work of zibetti , charlot & rix ( 2009 ) , who provide mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath135 ) in sdss bands for galaxy stellar populations as a function of one or more colors .",
    "they also show that the mass - to - light ratio in the @xmath38-band is well determined ( low scatter and low dust effects ) by one color alone , @xmath39 .",
    "fortunately , our subaru images provide photometry in closely related bands , however we still need to transform the johnson - cousins system to the sdss system .    with only one color at hand , we have little knowledge of the stellar population parameters ( primarily age and metallicity ) that effect the transformation between photometric bands .",
    "we refer to jordi , grebel & ammon ( 2006 ) when calculating @xmath136 with our measured @xmath137 ; this transformation is based on stetson s extension of the landolt standard stars and hence a mix of stellar populations . a transformation from johnson @xmath51 to sdss @xmath38",
    "is unfortunately not possible from the tables provided in jordi et al.(2006 ) ; we rely here on the relations of lupton ( 2005 ) , which are available on the sdss website and use the same set of standard stars .",
    "we obtain @xmath138 , corresponding to @xmath139 when adopting an absolute solar magnitude of @xmath140 ( blanton et al .",
    "with @xmath141 = 0.963 + 1.032 \\times ( g - i)$ ] , we obtain a stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath142 and a stellar mass for dgsat  i  of @xmath143 .",
    "we mention that the stellar @xmath144 is an uncertain quantity ; amongst other factors it is sensitive to priors in the star formation history and assumptions on the shape of the stellar initial mass function . for example , the relations of bell et al .",
    "( 2003 ) yield @xmath145 for the same @xmath39 color ; a factor of two higher than the result based on zibetti et al . for comparison , using either only population - i stars or population - ii stars , @xmath39 is 0.97 or 0.93 , i.e. the stellar population effects the color transformation by @xmath146 , and thus @xmath147 by a factor of @xmath148 .",
    "the @xmath38-band magnitude is even less sensitive to stellar population differences than the @xmath39 color .",
    "for example , using the sdss - johnson transformation derived for population - i stars from jordi et al . , in conjunction with @xmath149 colors from caldwell et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , @xmath150 differs by a mere @xmath151 from our adopted transformation using all standard stars .",
    "however , the relatively large systematic uncertainty in @xmath135 does not effect the conclusions of our study : that dgsat  i  is extremely extended for its mass ( or luminosity ) and therefore may represent a possible class of peculiar galaxies with an extremely low surface brightness ( that is typical of the much smaller dsph galaxies ) for their mass ( or size ) .",
    "we therefore attempt to explore further properties of dgsat - i from the available data , namely @xmath4 flux , star formation rate , and @xmath152 content , that may help to shed light on its formation .",
    "the lack of spatially extended emission lines in the sao spectra ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : spec ] ) is consistent with our @xmath4-band observations and rules out the possibility of this object being a nearby star - forming galaxy .",
    "this is also consistent with the observed upper limit of @xmath4 flux detected in our sao narrow band observations ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : ha ] ) .",
    "we also note that dgsat  i  was not detected in the 21 cm survey of this filament of the pisces - perseus superclusters by giovanelli & haynes ( 1989 ) . taking the upper limit for the flux of this survey , @xmath153 ( with signal - to - noise @xmath154 ) , this yields @xmath155 < 8.76 $ ] .",
    "we hence estimate the logarithm of the ratio of @xmath152-to - total stellar masses , @xmath156 . accepting this upper limit , implies about as much mass in @xmath152 as in stars .",
    "this is , for example , four times @xmath152 fraction than that found in the lmc ( kim et al .",
    "1998 ) , which has one of the highest @xmath152 fractions of the galaxies in the local universe .",
    "therefore we conclude that the upper - limit estimate is a very conservative one , and presume that @xmath157 of dgsat  i  is actually at least one magnitude lower .",
    "following @xcite , we determined the integral star - formation rate ( sfr ) in dgsat  i  by the relation ,    @xmath158 \\ ; = \\ ;   8.98 + 2 \\log(d[{\\rm mpc } ] ) + \\log(f_{c}({\\mathrm{h}\\alpha}))\\ ] ]    where @xmath159 is its integral flux @xmath160 in the @xmath4 line in @xmath161 ( see section [ subsec : ha ] ) , corrected for the galactic extinction @xmath162 = 0.538 @xmath163 ( * ? ? ? * with @xmath164=0.27 ) .",
    "the internal extinction in the dwarf galaxy itself was considered negligible .",
    "therefore , for the distance of dgsat  i , we obtain an upper limit of @xmath165 ) < -2.56 $ ] . the corresponding upper limit for the specific star formation rate ( ssfr ;",
    "the sfr per unit galaxy stellar mass ) is @xmath166 .",
    "karachentsev & kaisina ( 2013 ) discussed star formation properties of local volume galaxies .",
    "the sfr of dgsat  i  is somewhat low for its upper limit @xmath152 mass , but still consistent with the spread in their sample ( see their figure  5 ) .",
    "they showed that the median value of the ssfr does not change significantly for local volume galaxies with neutral hydrogen masses in the range @xmath167 < 9.5 $ ] .",
    "most galaxies have @xmath168 \\sim -10 $ ] , but with a large scatter towards the lower ssfr over the whole range of @xmath157 . some objects with neutral hydrogen masses in the range @xmath167 < 9.5 $ ] reach logarithmic ssfrs as low as @xmath169 .",
    "thus , the upper - limit ssfr and sfr/ @xmath170 ratio of dgsat  i  is consistent with their local volume study , and comparable with the values typical for quenched galaxies .",
    "however , sfr or hydrogen mass may also be much lower , a possibility that will have to await additional data to be tested .",
    "dgsat  i  displays a clear off - center over - density discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : galfit ] ( clearly visible in figure  2 and figure  7 ) .",
    "this raises the question of whether this feature harbors a young stellar population , originating in its last episode of star formation .",
    "interestingly , irregardless of the our treatment of the blue over - density in our galfit3modelling ( table 1 ) , the central @xmath171 color of the srsic  profile is still @xmath172 bluer than its global mean color ( compare the @xmath171 rows in the top two sections , @xmath117 and @xmath173 , in table  1 ) .",
    "it is not clear if this difference is real or an artifact from profile mismatch or background uncertainties .",
    "thus , we perform an additional test by comparing the mean color in two different regions : ( 1 ) a circular annulus between @xmath174 from the center of dgsat  i and ( 2 ) a small elliptical aperture at the center with semi - major and -minor axes @xmath175=14 , @xmath176=06 with a position angle of @xmath177 north - west . these two annuli are indicated in the left panel of figure  7(and described in the caption ) . as can be seen in figure  7 ,",
    "these two regions are largely selected based on the features of the @xmath171 color map , with the region ( 1 ) selected to both average over background fluctuations but also to avoid contamination from the blue over - density and region ( 2 ) selected to sample the core of the object . from this analysis",
    ", we find for region ( 1 ) @xmath178 and for region ( 2 ) @xmath179 , which broadly confirms the bluer nature of the center as measured in the galfit3  modelling ( table 1 ) . to ascertain the significance of this finding and evaluate any subjectivity in the definition of the regions ,",
    "we perform a monte - carlo re - analysis with @xmath180 samples , where the ( i ) center and ( ii ) specific parameters for the region shapes are allowed to vary . more specifically , for region ( 1 ) , the inner and outer radius and for region ( 2 ) , the semi - major and semi - minor axes ( @xmath175 , @xmath176 ) as well as the position angle",
    ". the center is allowed to shift by 20% of the harmonic axis mean ( 0.2@xmath181 ) , the direction of the shift is random , @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath175 and @xmath176 are varied by @xmath184 of their given value , and @xmath185 by @xmath186 .",
    "all variations are independent of one another and uniformly distributed within their bounds . as a result , the geometric color uncertainty is small , with a standard deviation of @xmath187 in the outer ( central ) aperture , which confirms that the bluer color for the center is robust .",
    "it is difficult to assess with the current data what this @xmath188 color difference in the center implies about a possible stellar population gradient .",
    "the color offset , location and shape of the over - density is similar to those reported for dwarf elliptical ( de ) galaxies by lisker et al . ( 2006 ) , which were interpreted as the presence of young stars overlaying the mass - dominant old population .",
    "it is therefore likely that the bluer color of the over - density feature of dgsat  i  ( @xmath189 ) indicates the presence of young stars from a recent episode of star formation in this region of the galaxy .",
    "we report the discovery of dgsat  i a faint galaxy at a projected distance of 15  from the andromeda  ii dwarf satellite . its appearance , structural properties and absence of emission lines initially suggested an interesting case of an isolated dwarf galaxy well beyond the local group , with a surface brightness and structural properties similar to those of the classical mw dsphs like fornax or sculptor .",
    "however , our measured line - of - sight radial velocity ( @xmath190 ) reveals that dgsat  i  is a background system placed at a distance of @xmath6 and possibly associated with the filament of the pisces - perseus supercluster projected in this direction of the sky ( see figure  [ fig : image ] ) .    with @xmath191 ,",
    "@xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath115 , the central surface brightness , structural properties , and color are consistent with those of the ultra - diffuse galaxies recently reported in the coma cluster ( van dokkum et al .",
    "2015 ; koda et al .",
    "these galaxies have @xmath18-band central magnitudes of @xmath194 , effective radii of @xmath195 and appear nearly round on the sky with typical axis ratios of 0.8 , and @xmath196 .",
    "van dokumm et al . (",
    "2015 ) fitted a a srsic index of @xmath197 to their surface brightness profiles , but noted that the data were fit equally well with indices varying from n=0.5 to n=1.5 . in the case of dgsat",
    "i , our subaru images are deep enough for a robust 2d - profile fit , which yields @xmath198 .",
    "the absence of a clear disk structure or spiral arms in the subaru deep image of dgsat  i supports van dokkum s suggestion that these objects do not resemble the classical low - surface brightness galaxies well known in the literature .",
    "this is also consistent with the gas content and integral sfr of dgsat  i  that we found in sec .",
    "[ subsec : mass+sfr ] , which are typical for quenched galaxies .",
    "thus , dgsat  i  is the first ultra - diffuse galaxy found in the pisces - perseus supercluster .",
    "however , unlike these previous detected udgs , dgsat  i is almost a _ field _ udgs and is located in a sky region with a significant lower density of massive galaxies than those found in the center of the coma , virgo or fornax galaxy clusters .",
    "the formation mechanism for these ultra diffuse galaxies is unknown .",
    "they have only been found in clusters so far ( as is also the case for quenched dwarf galaxies ; gavazzi et al . 2010",
    "; geha et al . 2012 ) and their sersic indices , sizes , red colors and round morphologies resemble the most extended des ( e.g. , geha et al .",
    "2003 ; toloba et al .",
    "thus , one possibility is that they are the products of environmental effects affecting a progenitor population that falls into a cluster .",
    "the structural properties of these diffuse galaxies suggest that they are the extension to larger sizes of dwarf early - type galaxies ( des ; see figure 8) .",
    "dgsat  i  also has a mass in the range of those of des ( e.g. toloba et al .",
    "2014b ) , and its blue off - center kpc - scale over - density closely resembles those found in des as well ( lisker et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "tidal effects ( including harassment , stripping , stirring , and heating ) are environmental mechanisms produced by gravitational interactions between galaxies ( moore et al .",
    "1998 ; mayer et al . 2001 ; mastropietro et al .",
    "stripping and mass loss tend to reduce the sizes of the affected galaxies , making this an unlikely pathway to forming these ultra diffuse galaxies .",
    "however , some infalling galaxies could experience milder tidal heating effects .",
    "in fact , gnedin ( 2003 ) simulated tidal heating of low - surface - brightness disk galaxies in clusters , and found the disks could be completely transformed into spheroids while losing few of their stars and remaining large in size . in combination with ram pressure stripping to quench the galaxies and remove their gas content ( e.g. lin & faber 1983 ; boselli et al .",
    "2008 ; boselli et al .",
    "2014 ; toloba et al .",
    "2015 ) , this may be a viable mechanism for the origins of udgs . to test this scenario ,",
    "more focused simulations are needed , in combination with further observational information ( mainly to determine their total masses through robust stellar velocity dispersion measurements ) about the udg population .",
    "these models should also explain the presence of apparently isolated udgs like dgsat   i. this would help to discriminate if these systems are tidally perturbed versions of a known type of galaxy or ( as previously suggested ) a new type of _ peculiar dwarf _ or _ failed giant _ depending upon their total masses ( beasley et al .",
    "dgsat i could provide important leverage in discriminating between the models , owing to its presence at the outskirts  or beyond  of a galaxy cluster ( zw 0107 + 3212 : with a projected distance of 1.8 mpc ) .",
    "one possibility is that it is a `` backsplash '' galaxy that has passed through the center of the cluster ( e.g. , gill et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "our detection of this hitherto unknown ultra - diffuse galaxy shows the value of using small aperture ( 10 to 15@xmath199 ) apochromatic telescopes with commercial ccd cameras to detect faint , low surface brightness galaxies which can not be identified through resolved stellar populations or hi surveys .",
    "in fact , their wide fields and depths ( 23 magnitudes deeper than the poss - ii survey ) make them ideal for uncovering sparse areas of galaxy clusters up to @xmath200 at low surface brightness levels , and check whether a significant population of still undetected , ultra - diffuse galaxies exist .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of dgsat  i , an ultra - diffuse , quenched galaxy located 104 degrees in projection from the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this low - surface brightness galaxy ( @xmath0 ) , found with a small amateur telescope , appears unresolved in sub - arcsecond archival subaru / suprime - cam images , and hence has been missed by optical surveys relying on resolved star counts , in spite of its relatively large effective radius ( @xmath1 ) and proximity ( 15 ) to the well - known dwarf spheroidal galaxy and ii . </S>",
    "<S> its red color ( @xmath2 ) , shallow srsic index ( @xmath3 ) , and the absence of detectable @xmath4 emission are typical properties of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and suggest that it is mainly composed of old stars .    initially interpreted as an interesting case of an isolated dwarf spheroidal galaxy in the local universe , our radial velocity measurement obtained with the bta 6-meter telescope ( @xmath5 ) shows that this system is an m31-background galaxy associated with the filament of the pisces - perseus supercluster . at the distance of this cluster ( @xmath6 ) , dgsat  i  would have an @xmath7 and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> its properties resemble those of the ultra - diffuse galaxies recently discovered in the coma cluster . </S>",
    "<S> dgsat  i  is the first case of these rare ultra - diffuse galaxies found in this galaxy cluster . unlike the ultra - diffuse galaxies associated with the coma and virgo clusters , dgsat i is found in a much lower density environment , which provides a fresh constraint on the formation mechanisms for this intriguing class of galaxy </S>"
