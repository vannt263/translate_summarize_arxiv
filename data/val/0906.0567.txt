    "the first multiple exoplanet system detected around a normal star was the triple system @xmath3 andromadae @xcite . today , over 30 systems comprising more than one planet are known @xcite , including seven triple systems , two quadruple systems ( @xmath4 arae @xcite and gj 581 ( mayor et al . a&a submitted ) ) and the quintuple system 55 cancri @xcite .",
    "individual multiplanet systems offer insights into the dynamical evolution of planetary systems that singleton systems can not .",
    "for instance , @xcite showed that @xmath3 andromedae bears the scars of strong planet - planet scattering events preserved in their planets orbital parameters .",
    "other systems show evidence of migration and eccentricity pumping through mean - motion resonances ( mmrs ) , which may be the signpost of convergent migration in multi - planet systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "multiplanet systems with planet - planet interactions strong enough to be detected at current rv precision ( as in gj 876 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) allow for measurement of the inclination of the system , providing true planet masses .",
    "comparison of multiplanet systems as an ensemble to singleton systems provides observational constraints to theories and models of the early dynamical evolution and migration history of planetary systems .",
    "@xcite showed that the while the eccentricity distribution of planets in multi - planet systems is similar to that of apparently singleton systems , their semimajor axis distributions differ significantly .",
    "the concentration of planets with orbital periods near 3-days seen in the single - planet systems is absent in multi - planet systems , as is the sharp jump beyond 1 au in planet frequency .",
    "the fact that these features ( the 3-day pileup and the 1 au jump ) are functions planetary multiplicity strongly suggests that planet - planet interactions play a key role in both migration and the origin of eccentricities .",
    "the announcement of hip 14810 @xmath5 herein marks the tenth system with three or more detected planets and only the sixth known to host three or more giant ( @xmath6 ) planets .",

    "the minimum masses and orbital periods of the planets in this systems are similar to those of @xmath3 andromedae , but with the inner and outermost components reversed .",
    "for the three planets of hip 14810 we find : @xmath7 3.9 , 1.2 , and 0.6 @xmath1 , and @xmath8 6.67 , 147.7 , and 952 d , respectively .",
    "we find modest but significant eccentricities for all 3 components ( 0.14 , 0.16 , and 0.17 , respectively ) .",
    "table  [ star ] contains a summary of the stellar properties of hip 14810 (= bd+20 518 ) , which sits at 53 pc ( @xmath9 , * ? ? ? * ) and has @xmath10 .",
    "we have performed an lte analysis of our template spectra for hip 14810 and derived its mass and radius using the methods described in @xcite .",
    "although hip 14810 is a solar mass star ( @xmath11 ) , its metallicity ( @xmath12}}= + 0.26 $ ] ) and evolutionary status ( @xmath13 mag , as calculated in @xcite ) give it a spectral type of g5 .",
    "its low rotation ( @xmath14 km @xmath15 ) and ca ii h & k activity levels ( @xmath16 , measured with the methods described in @xcite ) are consistent with it being an old star ( age @xmath17 gyr ) .",
    "this combined with its relatively small distance from the main sequence make it a particularly good radial velocity target , since it is expected to exhibit very low levels of jitter @xcite .  of jitter ,",
    "consistent with the residuals to our best fit .",
    "this value is somewhat lower than predicted by the formulae in @xcite because that work included instrumental sources of noise associated with the hires ccd detector in place prior to aug 2004 .",
    "the new detector has significantly better charge transfer properties , and apparently contributes a negligible amount to our overall error budget . ]",
    "we began observations of hip 14810 in 2005 as part of the n2k survey @xcite at keck observatory using hires @xcite and our usual iodine technique @xcite to achieve typical internal ( random ) errors of 0.81.4 m@xmath15 .",
    "the presence of the innermost planet and the large resuiduals to its orbital fit inspired the california planet search consortium to continue regular observations of this system at keck .",
    "@xcite announced component also appears in the _ catalog of nearby exoplanets _ @xcite . ]",
    "the inner two planets of hip 14810 , though with a rather poor fit for the @xmath18 component due to the poor phase coverage and the unaccounted - for effects of the @xmath5 component . also complicating the fit was what is now obviously a spurious data point , acquired during early dusk when significant contamination from the solar spectrum likely produced an erroneous radial velocity measurement .",
    "we have applied a more rigorous data retention scheme ( based solely on the measured internal errors , not deviations from a fit ) to the data set presented in table  [ vels ] .",
    "these velocities and uncertainties supersede our previously published values for this star , as we continue to refine our data reduction pipeline @xcite .",
    "note that the times given in the table are in heliocentric julian days , and the quoted errors are our internal ( random ) errors , with no `` jitter '' included .    by 2007 ,",
    "residuals to a 2-planet fit clearly showed coherent structure indicative of an outer companion .",
    "as figure  [ fig ] shows , by late 2008 , these residuals appeared to describe one complete orbit of a @xmath19 d planet with modest eccentricity ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "we have performed a monte carlo false alarm probability ( fap ) analysis of the complete set of residuals to determine the likelihood that an orbital fit of this quality could have been arrived at by chance .",
    "this method is very similar to the fap analyses in @xcite , and we refer the reader to those works for more details .",
    "after binning the data in 24-hour intervals and subtracting the best 2-planet fit , we redrew these residuals 1000 times ( that is , we kept the times of observation the same for each trial , but at each time assigned a new velocity and velocity uncertainty pair randomly drawn from the entire set , with replacement ) .",
    "we then added the nominal orbital solution for the @xmath18 component back into these new residuals and performed a thorough search for the best - fit 2-planet orbital solution to each of these 1000 realizations of the data .",
    "we measure the fap as the fraction of these realizations for which we find a solution superior or equivalent in fit quality to the nominal solution .",
    "note that this is an extremely conservative test of the fap of the new planet , @xmath5 , because we have not restricted the parameter search for the fap trials to long period or low eccentricity planets .",
    "the best - fit solutions found for the artificial data sets are thus often at short periods ( @xmath21d ) and/or high eccentricites @xmath22 ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . nonetheless ,",
    "even with this large parameter space available , we find that none of our 1000 realizations produced a better fit than the actual data , yielding an fap @xmath23 .",
    "we have fit the data using the publicly available multi - planet rv - fitting idl package ` rv_fit_mp ` , described in @xcite . in table",
    "[ orbital ] we present the best 3-planet keplerian ( kinematic ) fit , which yields r.m.s .",
    "residuals of 2.3 m@xmath15 , and we plot the fit and velocities in figure  [ fig ] . we have observed just over one complete orbit for the outer component , hip 14810@xmath5 , and so its orbital parameters are sensitive to the assumption that there are no additional , external planets detectably influencing the velocities . in particular , it is possible that such an additional planet could be contributing a nearly linear trend to the observed radial velocities , a trend which might be absorbed into the @xmath5 component s orbital parameters as an inflated eccentricity .",
    "any such degeneracy will be broken in the near future as the @xmath5 component completes its second orbit .",
    "continued observation of this system will thus reveal the presence of any additional detectable planets and allow for further analysis of their interactions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have performed long - term numerical integrations to test for stability of the orbital solution here , under the assumption that there are only three planets in the system . for these long - term stability tests ,",
    "we applied direct n - body integrations to 100 orbital solutions consistent with the rv data , assuming an edge - on orientation . using a variant of the bootstrapping described in @xcite .",
    "we generate a suite of plausible data sets and calculate the best - fit solution for each realization .",
    "we selected 100 of these realizations as the basis for this stability analysis , as in @xcite .",
    "] we integrated for at least @xmath24 years using the hybrid integrator in mercury @xcite . for the majority of each integration",
    ", mercury uses a mixed - variable symplectic integrator @xcite with a time step approximately equal to a hundredth of the keplerian orbital period calculated at a semi - major axis equal to the pericenter distance of the closest planet . during close encounters",
    ", mercury uses a bulrich - stoer integrator with an accuracy parameter of @xmath25 .",
    "we identified each set of initial conditions as an unstable system if : 1 ) two planets collide , 2 ) a planet is accreted onto the star ( astrocentric distance less than 0.005au ) , or 3 ) a planet is ejected from the system ( astrocentric distance exceeds 100au ) .",
    "all of our simulations proved stable , and we manually verified that in all cases the final orbits were qualitatively similar to the initial conditions .",
    "we also ran an additional set of simulations for inclined ( but coplanar ) orientations of the system ( i.e. smaller values of @xmath26 , and thus higher true planet masses and larger planet - planet interactions ) and find the system to be stable for all tested scenarios with @xmath27 .",
    "in addition , we performed dynamical analyses of three planet solutions using ensembles of initial conditions generated via bayesian posterior sampling methods ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , both ignoring and including the planet - planet interactions .",
    "we found that the superposition of keplerians approximation is a very good approximation for the nominal edge - on configuration .",
    "as the orbits approach face - on , the planet - planet interactions eventually become significant for inclinations of a few degrees . while we only considered coplanar configurations",
    ", we expect that our results are likely representative for relative inclinations of up to 20 or 30 degrees .",

    "we acquired 1099 good photometric observations of hip  14810 during four observing seasons spanning 1180 days between 2005 november and 2009 february with the t11 0.8 m automated photometric telescope ( apt ) at fairborn observatory .",
    "the t11 apt and its two - channel strmgren @xmath51 and @xmath52 photometer are very similar to the t8 0.8 m apt and precision photometer described in @xcite .",
    "the measurements of hip  14810 were made differentially with respect to the comparison star hd  18404 ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 , f5 iv ) .",

    "although we do not expect radial velocity variations due to long period variations in stellar activity in such old stars @xcite , we have also searched for photometric variations at the period of the outer ( @xmath5 ) planet ( @xmath58 d ) . while our dataset is not yet long enough to make this determination definitively , we see no suggestion of photometric variations at this period so far .    in the top panel of figure  [ phot ]",

    "the precisely determined orbit of hip  14810@xmath51 ( figure  [ fig ] , top panel ) translates into an uncertainty in the mid - transit time that is smaller than the plotted points in the bottom of figure  [ phot ] .",
    "the mean of the 120 observations within the transit window is @xmath60 mag ; the mean of the 979 observations outside the window is @xmath61 mag .",
    "thus , the brightness levels inside and outside of the predicted transit window agree to within 0.00013 mag , allowing us to rule out transits of the @xmath51 component for all reasonable densities .",
