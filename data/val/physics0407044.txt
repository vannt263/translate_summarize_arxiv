    "the process of flame propagation presents an extremely complicated mathematical problem .",
    "the governing equations include the nonlinear flow equations for the fuel and the products of combustion , as well as the transfer equations governing the heat conduction and species diffusion inside the flame front .",
    "fortunately , in practice , an inner flame scale determined by the latter processes is large compared to the flame front thickness , implying that the flame can be considered as a gasdynamic discontinuity .",
    "the initial problem is reduced thereby to a purely hydrodynamic problem of determining the propagation of a surface of discontinuity in an incompressible fluid , the laws of this propagation given by the usual navier - stokes and continuity equations complemented by the jump conditions at the surface , expressing the mass and momentum conservation across the flame front .",
    "the asymptotic methods@xmath2 allow one to express these conditions in the form of a power series with respect to the small flame front thickness .    despite this considerable progress",
    ", however , a closed theoretical description of the flame propagation is still lacking .",
    "what is meant by the term `` closed description '' here is the description of flame dynamics as dynamics of the flow variables _ on _ the flame front surface .",
    "reduction of the system of bulk equations and jump conditions , mentioned above , to this `` surface dynamics '' implies solving the flow equations for the fuel and the combustion products , satisfying given boundary conditions and the jump conditions at the flame front , and has only been carried out asymptotically for the case @xmath3 where @xmath1 is the gas expansion coefficient defined as the ratio of the fuel density and the density of burnt matter@xmath4    difficulties encountered in trying to obtain a closed description of flames are conditioned by the following two crucial aspects :    \\(1 ) characterized by the flow velocities which are typically well below the speed of sound , deflagration represents an essentially nonlocal process , in the sense that the flame - induced gas flows , both up- and downstream , strongly affect the flame front structure itself .",
    "a seeding role in this reciprocal process is played by the landau - darrieus ( ld ) instability of zero thickness flames@xmath5 a very important factor of non - locality of the flame propagation is the vorticity production in the flame , which highly complicates the flow structure downstream . in particular , the local relation between pressure and velocity fields upstream , expressed by the bernoulli equation , no longer holds for the flow variables downstream .",
    "\\(2 ) deflagration is a highly nonlinear process which requires an adequate non - perturba- + tive description of flames with arbitrary values of the flame front slope . as a result of development of the ld - instability , exponentially growing perturbations with arbitrary wavelengths make any initially smooth flame front configuration corrugated .",
    "characteristic size of the resulting `` cellular '' structure is of the order of the cutoff wavelength @xmath6 given by the linear theory of the ld - instability@xmath7 @xmath8 is the flame front thickness .",
    "the exponential growth of unstable modes is ultimately suppressed by the nonlinear effects . since for arbitrary @xmath1",
    "the governing equations do not contain small parameters , it is clear that the ld - instability can only be suppressed by the nonlinear effects if the latter are not small , and therefore so is the flame front slope .",
    "the stabilizing role of the nonlinear effects is best illustrated in the case of stationary flame propagation .",
    "numerical experiments@xmath9 on 2d flames with @xmath10 show that even in very narrow tubes ( tube width of the order @xmath11 ) , typical values for the flame front slope are about @xmath12 nonlinearity can be considered small only in the case of small gas expansion , @xmath3 where one has the @xmath13 estimate for the slope , so that it is possible to derive an equation@xmath14 for the flame front position in the framework of the perturbation expansion in powers of @xmath15    this perturbative method gives results in a reasonable agreement with the experiment only for flames with @xmath16 propagating in very narrow tubes ( tube width of the order @xmath11 ) , so that the front slope does not exceed unity .",
    "flames of practical importance , however , have @xmath1 up to 10 , and propagate in tubes much wider than @xmath17 as a result of development of the ld - instability , such flames turn out to be highly curved , which leads to a noticeable increase of the flame velocity . in connection with this , a natural question arises whether it is possible to develop a non - perturbative approach to the flame dynamics , closed in the sense mentioned above , which would be applicable to flames with arbitrary gas expansion .",
    "a deeper root of this problem is the following _ dilemma : _ as was mentioned above , the flame propagation is an essentially non - local process ; on the other hand , this non - locality itself is determined by the flame front configuration and the structure of gas flows near the front , so the question is whether an explicit bulk structure of the flow downstream is necessary in deriving an equation for the flame front position . in other words ,",
    "we look for an approach that would provide a closed description of flames more directly , without the need to solve the flow equations explicitly .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop such approach in the stationary case .",

    "as was mentioned in the point ( 1 ) of introduction , an important factor of the flow non - locality downstream is the vorticity production in curved flames , which highly complicates relations between the flow variables . in the presence of vorticity",
    ", pressure is expressed through the velocity field by an integral relation , its kernel being the green function of the laplace operator .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the jump condition for the pressure across the flame front only serves as the boundary condition for determining an appropriate green function , being useless in other respects .",
    "thus , it is convenient to exclude pressure from our consideration from the very beginning .",
    "the basis for this is provided by the well - known thomson circulation theorem .",
    "thus , we begin in sec .",
    "[ flowequations ] with the standard formulation of the problem of flame propagation , and then construct a formal implicit solution of the flow equations with the help of this theorem in sec .",
    "[ integral ] .",
    "let us consider a 2d stationary flame propagating in an initially uniform premixed ideal fluid .",
    "let the cartesian coordinates @xmath18 be chosen so that the @xmath19-axis is in the direction of flame propagation , @xmath20 being in the fresh fuel .",
    "it will be convenient to introduce the following dimensionless variables @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the velocity of a plane flame front , @xmath24 is the initial pressure in the fuel far ahead of the flame front , and @xmath25 is some characteristic length of the problem ( e.g. , the tube width ) . the fluid density will be normalized on the fuel density @xmath26    as numerical experiments show , stationary flames exist only in sufficiently narrow tubes .",
    "hence , assuming the tube walls ideal , and denoting its width by @xmath27 we will deal below with spatially @xmath28-periodic flames .",
    "more precisely , given a flame configuration described by the functions @xmath29 @xmath30,$ ] where @xmath31 denotes the flame front position , using the boundary conditions @xmath32 for @xmath33 we continue this solution to the domain @xmath34 $ ] according to @xmath35 and then periodically continue it to the whole @xmath36-axis .    in connection with this procedure the following circumstance should be emphasized .",
    "all subsequent analysis is carried out under assumption that there exists a short wavelength cut - off for the flame perturbations . in other words ,",
    "we consider flames with small but non - zero front thickness@xmath37 existence of such a cut - off ensures smoothness of the functions under consideration . in particular , it prevents development of singularities such as the edge points occurring at the front of a zero - thickness flame , which lead to discontinuities in the values of the flow variables or their derivatives .",
    "the end points of the flame front , however , still represent a potential source of such discontinuities even in the case of flames with non - zero thickness because of the possibility of stream line refraction at these points , resulting in a formation of stagnation zones in the flow of burnt matter ( see ref .  11 for more detail ) .",
    "having imposed the boundary condition @xmath38 we thereby exclude this possibility . in view of what has just been said ,",
    "it is natural to assume further that considered as functions of the complex argument , @xmath31 together with the `` on - shell '' values of the flow velocity , @xmath39 @xmath40 are analytical functions of @xmath36 in a vicinity of the real axis .",
    "this assumption , simplifying subsequent analysis , is only technical , and can be weakened if necessary .",
    "as always , we assume that the process of flame propagation is nearly isobaric . then the velocity and pressure fields obey the following equations in the bulk @xmath41 where @xmath42 and summation over repeated indices is implied .",

    "( [ thomson ] ) , the vorticity @xmath47 is conserved along the stream lines . as a simple consequence of this theorem , one can find the general solution of the flow equations upstream .",
    "namely , since the flow is potential at @xmath48 ( @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the velocity of the flame in the rest frame of reference of the fuel ) , it is potential for every @xmath52 therefore , @xmath53 where the linear hilbert operator @xmath54 is defined by @xmath55 and @xmath56 in the coordinate representation , @xmath54 acts on a function @xmath57 such that @xmath58 for @xmath59 according to @xmath60    it will be shown in the next section how the thomson theorem can be used to obtain a formal integral of the flow equations downstream .",

    ". our aim below will be to transform the latter to an integral over the flame front surface .",
    "to this end , we decompose @xmath80 into elementary @xmath63 as follows .",
    "let us take a couple of stream lines crossing the flame front at points @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . consider the gas elements moving between these lines , which cross the front between the time instants @xmath83 and @xmath84 during this time interval , these elements fill a space element @xmath85 adjacent to the flame front .",
    "for sufficiently small @xmath86 the volume of @xmath85 @xmath87 where @xmath88 the subscript``@xmath89 '' means that the corresponding quantity is evaluated just behind the flame front , _",
    "i.e. , _ for @xmath90 and @xmath91 is the normal velocity of the burnt gas , @xmath92 being the unit vector normal to the flame front ( pointing to the burnt matter ) .",
    "after another time interval of the same duration @xmath93 the elements move to a space element @xmath94 adjacent to @xmath95 since the flow is incompressible , @xmath94 is of the same volume as @xmath95 continuing this , the space between the two stream lines turns out to be divided into an infinite sequence of @xmath80 s of the same volume , adjacent to each other .",

    "( [ vint ] ) can be written as @xmath97 where @xmath98 denotes the flame front surface ( the front line in our 2d case ) , @xmath99 and @xmath100 trajectory of a particle crossing the point @xmath101 at @xmath102    substituting expression ( [ vint1 ] ) into eq .",
