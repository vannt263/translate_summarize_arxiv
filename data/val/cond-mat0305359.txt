    "spatial confinements of systems undergoing continuous phase transitions perturb the fluctuation spectrum of the corresponding ordering degrees of freedom .",
    "this leads to a dependence of the free energy of the systems on the distance between the confining walls which can be expressed in terms of universal scaling function .",
    "their gradient renders the so - called critical casimir forces which are the analogues of the well known electro - magnetic casimir or dispersion forces .",
    "recent developments in the theory of casimir forces in critical and correlated fluids  @xcite have provided a strong motivation for testing them experimentally in various systems .",
    "capacity studies of @xmath1he wetting films near the superfluid transition @xmath3  @xcite have confirmed the existence of the critical casimir effect and for temperatures @xmath4 quantitative agreement with corresponding theoretical predictions has been found  @xcite .",
    "similar effects have been observed for wetting films of binary liquid mixtures near the critical end - point of their demixing transition  @xcite .",
    "additional evidence for the critical casimir force and detailed data have been reported for wetting films at solid substrates of @xmath0he-@xmath1he mixtures near their tricritical point  @xcite .",
    "these latter experiments have also raised new interesting challenges for the theory , which have motivated the present work . among them",
    "is the sign and the amplitude of the casimir force or , more generally , the form of its scaling function for different values of the concentration of @xmath0he atoms .",
    "theory predicts that these features of the casimir force crucially depend on the type of boundary conditions which the confining surfaces impose on the order parameter  @xcite .",
    "for example , the force should be attractive for symmetric boundary conditions and repulsive for nonsymmetric boundary conditions .",
    "the distinction between the surface universality classes is also relevant . in the case of pure @xmath1he films near the @xmath5-point the boundary conditions at the two confining interfaces of the wetting layer seem to be very well approximated by symmetric dirichlet boundary conditions forming the so - called ordinary surface universality class , because the quantum - mechanical wave function that describes the superfluid state vanishes at both interfaces  @xcite . for films of @xmath0he-@xmath1he mixture",
    "the situation is less clear . in these systems a @xmath1he - rich layer forms near the substrate - fluid interface , which may become superfluid already above the @xmath5-line  @xcite , whereas there is an enrichment of @xmath0he near the opposing fluid - vapor interface .",
    "thus the two interfaces impose a nontrivial concentration profile , which in turn couples to the superfluid order parameter .",
    "the experiment of ref.@xcite reports a repulsive casimir force at the tricritical point but it is not immediately obvious that the concentration profile induces effectively nonsymmetric boundary conditions for the superfluid order parameter , i.e. , symmetry - breaking boundary conditions at the substrate - fluid interface ( also known as the so - called extraordinary or normal universality class ) and dirichlet boundary conditions at the fluid - vapor interface .",
    "the superfluid order parameter possesses a continuous @xmath2 symmetry so that if the layer is effectively two - dimensional it is in the kosterlitz - thouless phase with the superfluid order - parameter equal to zero  @xcite . on the other hand , upon approaching the @xmath5-line from the high temperature side the superfluid layer thickens due to the increase of the correlation length and a dimensional crossover to a three - dimensional superfluid phase with non - zero order - parameter should take place  @xcite . in order to be able to interpret and to understand the features of the casimir force and other surface and finite - size effects in @xmath0he-@xmath1he mixture films near the tricritical point systematic studies of a model system are needed . due to the universal character of the critical casimir force it is sufficient to choose as a model system one which belongs to the same universality class as the actual physical system .",
    "the prerequisite of such future studies is a detailed analysis of the bulk properties of such a suitable model .",
    "this is the purpose of the present paper .",
    "the model should resemble the main features of the bulk phase diagram of @xmath0he-@xmath1he mixtures in three dimensions ( @xmath6 ) and take into account the continuous rotational o(2 ) symmetry of the superfluid degrees of freedom of @xmath1he .",

    "there is a transition from a normal fluid to a superfluid phase characterized by a complex order parameter .",
    "if @xmath1he is diluted with @xmath0he , the superfluid transition temperature is depressed .",
    "simultaneously , the tendency toward phase separation increases and at a critical @xmath0he concentration the mixture undergoes a first - order phase transition into a @xmath1he - rich and a @xmath0he - rich phase , of which only the @xmath1he - rich phase is superfluid . in the temperature - @xmath0he concentration plane @xmath7 the line of second - order superfluid transitions @xmath8 meets the boundary of the two - phase coexistence region at the tricritical point @xmath9 ; @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , denotes the number of atoms of @xmath0he or @xmath1he , respectively .",

    "here we are concerned only with the case @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "when all occupation numbers @xmath15 are equal to 1 , up to constants the first term in eq.([eq : ham ] ) corresponds to the classical @xmath44 model ( the planar rotator model ) for pure @xmath1he .",

    "it was first proposed by berker and nelson  @xcite and , independently , by cardy and scalpino  @xcite to describe thin _ films _ of @xmath0he-@xmath1he mixtures , for which the mechanism of the superfluid transition is different from that in @xmath6 ; there is no spontaneous breaking of the continuous symmetry in @xmath13  @xcite , i.e. , the order parameter does not become nonzero below the transition temperature .",
