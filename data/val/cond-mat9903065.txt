    "the properties of high - t@xmath6 materials are discussed on the basis of the model of d - type symmetry of superconducting gap order parameter . this model explains , in particular , the dependence of the critical current from the magnetic field in bimetallic dc squids with junction yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( ybco ) and pb [ 1 ] and the spontaneous excitation of the flux quantum in tricrystals [ 2 ] .",
    "but some experimental results are contradictory . on the one hand",
    "there is no critical current in the junctions ybco / s - superconductor along c - axis direction [ 3 - 5 ] , which is in good agreement with the theory of tunneling between d - superconductors and s - superconductor ; on the other hand , there are several experiments [ 6 - 8 ] , where the evident critical current was obtained , which amplitude value changes from magnetic and microwave fields in accordance with the theory of s - superconductors .",
    "to explain the experiments [ 6 - 8 ] it was supposed [ 9 ] , that there is a mixture of d and s - type superconducting carriers in high - t@xmath6 materials due to their orthorombic structure and the diffusive scattering near the interface or the twins in high - t@xmath6 films causes the increase of the contribution of s - superconductor [ 9,10 ] .",
    "note , that the evaluation barrier transparencies ( averaged over the quasiparticle momentum directions ) for pb/(au , ag)/ybco presented in [ 6 - 8 ] gives @xmath7 with the junction areas @xmath8 .",
    "in this report we present the results of experimental investigations of current transport in the small areas junctions ( @xmath9x@xmath10 ) s - superconductor / normal metal / high temperature superconductor ( nb / au / ybco ) with the averaged au / ybco c - axis interface transparency @xmath4 .",
    "the experimental results are analyzed from two points of view : classical bcs theory and modern theoretical investigations , where d - type symmetry of the order parameter in ybco film is supposed .",
    "the steps of the fabrication procedure are presented on the figure 1 .",
    "ybco thin films were made with two methods : the laser ablation technique and dc sputtering at high oxygen pressure .",
    "we used two kinds of substrates : ( 110 ) oriented ndgao@xmath1 or r - cut sapphire with ceo@xmath0 buffer layer .",
    "so , we got c - axis oriented ( 001 ) epitaxial ybco films with 100 - 150 nm thickness .",
    "the following superconducting properties were obtained : the superconducting transition temperature t@xmath11=84 - 88k and superconducting temperature width @xmath12=0.5 - 1k ; resistance ratio at 300k and 100k r@xmath13/r@xmath142.8 .",
    "the density of particles on the ybco film surface was @xmath15@xmath16 .",
    "the high quality of obtained ybco films is confirmed by low value of the width of x - ray ( 005 ) @xmath17 scan fwhm(005)@xmath18 for 150 nm thick ybco film .",
    "we used the following fabrication procedure of nb / au / ybco junctions : a ) nb / au / ybco trilayer structure deposition ; b ) definition of the area of the junction with photolithography , ion and plasma chemical techniques ; c ) deposition of insulating ceo@xmath0 layer to prevent the electrical contacts in a - b plane of ybco ; d ) contact pads deposition and structuring .",
    "the thin layer of the normal metal ( n - metal ) ( au , ag , pt ) 10 - 20 nm thickness was deposited in - situ by rf sputtering after ybco film deposition ( fig.1a ) .",
    "the next step is the dc - magnetron deposition of nb counter electrode 100 - 150 nm thickness .",
    "the absence of chemical reaction between au and nb causes the using of nb .",
    "note , the possible chemical interaction between au and pb could be occurred in the experiments [ 4 - 7 ] , where pb is used .    on the next step",
    "the area of the junction was defined using the photolithography , ion and plasma - chemical etching ( fig.1b ) . to prevent the electrical contact in a - b plane of ybco film , the area of the junction with the central window 8x8@xmath19 was insulated by ceo@xmath0 layer using self - aligned technique ( fig.1c ) . at the last step the contact pads from au is formed(fig .",
    "we used the 2 points contact pads to the top ( nb ) layer in order to realize 4 points measurement technique at the temperature below the t@xmath6 of ybco film .",
    "the junctions were positioning on the parts of ybco film surface , which had no particles . for measurement of and critical current density",
    "two orthogonal 4 @xmath20 width ybco bridges were made on the same substrate .",
    "more than 30 samples nb / n - metal / ybco with au , ag and pt as a n - metal were fabricated .",
    "here we discuss the results of investigations of 9 samples nb / au / ybco with the small tolerance of the normal resistance @xmath21 ( less than 4 times , see table 1 ) made with the same fabrication parameters .",
    "the dependencies of the junction resistance from temperature @xmath22 at bias current 1 - 5@xmath23 and i - v curves at temperature range 4.2 - 300k were measured .",
    "the fig.2 presents the @xmath22 dependencies for one of the junctions and for ybco bridge placed on the same substrate .",
    "the dependence @xmath24 for one of the junction is in the good correspondence with one for ybco microbridge , which is situated on the same substrate . at @xmath25 @xmath24",
    "has a metallic dependence , i.e. the decrease of @xmath22 .",
    "this behavior is usual for a - b plane current flow , so ybco  film gives the main contribution to the resistance at @xmath25 .",
    "the inset to the fig.2 shows the @xmath22 dependence of the junction at @xmath26 , the increase of the resistance with the decrease of temperature .",
    "the @xmath22 value is dependent from the measurement current .",
    "the dependencies of @xmath27 from the bias voltage are presented at fig.3 at different temperatures . the value of @xmath28 increase with the decrease of @xmath29 , which is reflected on @xmath22 dependence .",
    "the strong nonlinear behavior of i - v - curve at 72kt84k is due to a break down of superconductivity in ybco  film by transport current .",
    "note , that there is a difference between the @xmath30 of the junction near @xmath31 and the asymptotic @xmath32 at @xmath33 .",
    "parameters of the investigated junctions , fabricated at equal conditions , are presented in table 1 .",
    "the interface resistance @xmath21 allows to evaluate the averaged interface transparency , which will be used in future [ 11 ] :    @xmath34 where @xmath35 - the minimum value of fermi - momentum from ybco and au .",
    "the values of transparency for the interface au / ybco are presented in the table 1 for fabricated samples .",
    "we use the values @xmath36 at @xmath37 .",
    "we also investigated the bilayer structures au / ybco , nb / ybco and au / nb , prepared with the same technology as trilayer ones .",
    "the resistance of these interfaces are as follows : @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 . from the comparison with the results presented in the table 1 for the junction",
    "nb / au / ybco , we can neglect the nb / au interface resistance , and take into account only au / ybco interface resistance .",
    "@xmath41 for au / ybco junctions show the similar behavior as @xmath41 for nb / au / ybco .",
    "figure 4 presents the surface of bilayer structure au / ybco , measured with the atomic force microscope ( afm ) .",
    "one can see the strongly nonuniform surface , which consists of au granules with about 1@xmath20 distance between its .",
    "so , there is a good electrical contact in the parts of the film , where nb film covers au granules on ybco .",
    "but between the au granules , where nb film has direct contact with the surface of ybco , the oxygen depletion on the surface of the structure causes the increase of the resistance .",
    "direct electrical contact nb / ybco has the specific resistance 3 - 4 orders of magnitude higher than the au / ybco contact .",
    "we can consider the investigated structure as a parallel connection of grains nb / au / ybco and the parts of the structure with direct contact nb / ybco .",
    "we suppose , that the current flows through au / ybco interface , because of the big resistance nb / ybco interface and we can use the schematic model , presented on the fig.5 . : the superconducting electrode ybco ( s@xmath42 ) with the critical temperature of the superconducting transition @xmath43 and thickness 100 - 150 nm ; the damaged layer of ybco ( s@xmath44 ) 1 - 3 nm thickness with suppressed superconducting order parameter ; normal metal layer 10 - 20 nm thickness ; the superconducting nb counter electrode ( s@xmath45 ) with @xmath46 .",
    "the analogous model was suggested in [ 4 ] for the evaluation of the electrophysical parameters in the system pb / au / ybco .",
    "let s evaluate the behavior of the superconducting order parameter in such nb / au / ybco structure .",
    "first , consider the nb / au interface .",
    "it s measured resistance is low enough , so we can conclude , that superconducting green function ( which is the characteristic of the amplitude of the interaction potential of the superconducting carriers @xmath47 ) and it s derivative are continuous in the interface . using calculations [ 12,13 ] we obtained the value of the superconducting order parameter at the interface @xmath48560@xmath49 , which is a bit smaller than in the bulk nb . for our evaluations we used the following values of electrophysical parameters nb and au at @xmath50 : @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 - fermi velocities and @xmath59 - mean free paths of nb and au correspondingly .    for the ybco / au interface",
    "we suppose , that it could be the 3 nm thickness damaged layer of ybco @xmath60 with the reduced critical temperature ( may be nonsuperconductive ) .",
    "let s assume the small difference in the coherence length @xmath61 and that the specific resistance increases for the order of magnitude [ 4 ] from @xmath62 to @xmath63 .",
    "we have the value of the order parameter in ybco near the au / ybco interface @xmath64 qualitatively .",
    "there is a potential barrier with the low transparency @xmath4 direct on the au / ybco interface , which leads to the step of the order reduction in @xmath65 times:@xmath66 [ 13 ] .",
    "we used the theoretical evaluations for s - type pairing superconductors .",
    "but one can conclude from the evaluations [ 10,14 ] , that the behavior of the order parameter in d - superconductor are qualitatively the same as for s - superconductor if one of the main crystallographic directions of d - superconductor is normal to the interface .",
    "so , we can evaluate the amplitude value of the supercurrent through the whole structure as in the junction superconductor - normal metal - superconductor ( @xmath67 ) , where values of the order parameter on the interfaces are @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "than we use the theory developed for @xmath70-junctions .",
    "the thickness of the n - layer is of the same order of magnitude , that it s coherence length , so we can neglect the decrease of the order parameter in the n - layer and result @xmath71 .",
    "taking into account the value of the normal resistance of the junction @xmath72 , we get the value of @xmath73 , which is less than the fluctuation one for the measurement system @xmath74 and could not be observed even in the case of the dominant s - type component .",
    "if we have the pure @xmath75- superconductor , the critical current is equal to zero from the symmetry of the gap .",
    "the observed in [ 6 - 8 ] critical current in pb/(au , ag)/ybco structures with higher values of @xmath21 and junction areas , possibly , caused by a soft etching in the br - ethanol solution , which allows the current flow through the contacts to a - b planes of ybco .",
    "the transparencies of the interfaces with normal metals in a - b planes of ybco are 3 orders of magnitude higher , than along c - axis ( @xmath76 ) , but @xmath77 .",
    "so , the normal resistance resulted from the parallel connection of the interfaces along c - axis and a - b planes of ybco is equal to @xmath78 if @xmath79 . in the case of nb ,",
    "the oxygen depletion in a - b planes is stronger than along c - axis , so the influence of a - b plane tunneling is significantly reduced .",
    "the important fact is the possible interaction both with ybco and au with the formation of the superconducting alloy . in this case",
    "we have a superconductor with the low enough critical temperature instead of the normal metal , which could have a gap feature at low temperatures [ 6 - 8 ] .",
    "let s discuss the figure3 - the @xmath41 dependencies for the junctions at 4.2 - 100k temperature range .",
    "at @xmath80 the i - v curves correspond to the sin  junction : the increase of @xmath27 below the gap value .",
    "but there are no gap features of ybco .",
    "these two facts correspond to a gapless s - superconductor or d - superconductor with the nodes [ 14,16 ] .",
    "calculations [ 14 ] give the dependencies @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "note , that for s - superconductor with gap we have @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "for s - superconductors at @xmath85 , the number of excited quasiparticles increases exponentially with the temperature , so @xmath86 .",
    "it could be a great number of excited quasiparticles even at very low temperatures @xmath85 in d- superconductors due to the existence of nodes with zero value of the order parameter .",
    "so , @xmath87 must increase slower with the decrease of temperature [ 14 ] .",
    "in our experiment we have the linear @xmath22 dependence with decrease of t ( insert to a fig.2 ) .",
    "the dependence @xmath41 corresponds qualitatively to the theoretical calculations for d- superconductor [ 14 ] .",
    "one of the most interesting effects for d - superconductors is the existence of two types of the bound states .",
    "the surface states at low energies caused by a sign change of the order parameter for the reflected quasiparticles in the a - b plane of d- superconductor [ 14 - 16 ] .",
    "it leads to a minimum value on @xmath88 dependence at low @xmath89 i sin junction , which was observed for a - b plane current transport [ 6 - 8 ] . in our experiment",
    "we have no such effect due to the quasiparticle momentum along c - axis of ybco .",
    "another additional states could be present due to the suppression of the order parameter of d - type superconductor at the interface for the directions different from the main crystallographic ones or in the case of the diffusive scattering [ 16 ] .",
    "these states are observed at nonzero energies and weakly dependent from the temperature and the interface quality .",
    "one could found these states as decrease of @xmath27 at the values of @xmath90 near the gap of d - superconductor .",
    "the condition of the suppression of the order parameter is realized in our experiment due to the degradation of ybco surface .",
    "really , we found the weak minimum at @xmath91 for all measured samples , which did nt change it s position from the temperature .",
    "here we present the results of fabrication and experimental investigation of  the electron transport in nb / au / ybco junctions along c - axis of ybco .",
    "the transparencies of the barriers are one order of magnitude higher the ones from [ 6 - 8 ] .",
    "the evaluations on the basis of the proximity effect showed the absence the critical current cased by the au / ybco interface potential barrier .",
    "the @xmath41dependencies are analogous to the case of sin junctions with gapless superconductor , in particular , the absence of the gap feature for ybco could correspond to d - superconductivity , due to the existence of the nodes in the order parameter .",
    "@xmath22 dependencies are also in good agreement with the theory of d - superconductor . at @xmath91",
    "one could see the sharp decrease of the @xmath27 , which could be caused by the additional states at the interface of the d - type superconductor with the normal metal .",
