    "at any given time during the solar magnetic activity cycle most of the solar surface is covered by the internetwork regions of the `` quiet '' sun . although such regions look `` empty '' ( i.e. , devoided of magnetic signatures ) in low - resolution magnetograms , high - spatial - resolution observations reveal the presence of mixed magnetic polarities with a mean unsigned flux density of the order of 10 g , when choosing the best compromise between the polarimetric sensitivity and the spatio - temporal resolution currently attainable ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . however , when these zeeman - effect polarization signals are interpreted considering that the magnetic field is not spatially resolved ( for example , by assuming that one or more magnetic components coexist with a non - magnetic component within the spatio - temporal resolution element of the observations ) , it is found that the filling factor of the magnetic component(s ) is @xmath0% .",
    "the disadvantage of the zeeman effect as a diagnostic tool is that the amplitudes of the measured polarization signals become smaller with the increasing degree of cancellation of mixed magnetic polarities within the spatio - temporal resolution element .",
    "therefore , vanishing zeeman polarization does not necessarily imply absence of magnetic fields . on the contrary",
    ", the photospheric plasma of the quiet sun is expected to be permeated by highly tangled field lines with resulting mixed magnetic polarities on very small spatial scales , well beyond the current spatial resolution limit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "for this reason , it is believed that zeeman - effect diagnostics with the present - day instrumentation is showing us only the `` tip of the iceberg '' of solar surface magnetism ( @xmath0% of the photospheric volume ) .    how can we reliably investigate the magnetism of the remaining @xmath1% of the quiet solar atmosphere ?",
    "how can we obtain empirical information on the distribution of mixed - polarity magnetic fields at sub - resolution scales that are `` hidden '' to the zeeman effect ?",
    "do such fields carry most of the unsigned magnetic flux and magnetic energy of the sun , or is this flux and/or the magnetic energy dominated by small - scale magnetic flux concentrations in the kg range , as some recent investigations based on the zeeman effect of the lines at 6301.5  and 6302.5   seem to suggest ?",
    "how is the magnetic energy of the quiet sun distributed between upflows and downflows ? is the total magnetic energy stored in the quiet internetwork regions greater or smaller than that of the kg fields of the super - granulation network ? is this energy significant enough to compensate for the radiative losses of the outer solar atmosphere ? how is energy transported and dissipated in a mixed magnetic - polarity environment ?",
    "does this hidden magnetic flux complicate the topology of the magnetic fields of the outer solar atmosphere , or there simply are magnetic canopies , with mainly horizontal fields , in the quiet regions of the solar chromosphere ?    since the zeeman effect as a diagnostic tool is `` blind '' to magnetic fields that are tangled on scales too small to be resolved , the investigation of the magnetism of the quiet sun via spectro - polarimetry must rely on other tools as well .",
    "in addition to zeeman diagnostics developed to interpret the observed _ asymmetries _ of stokes profiles  resulting from the co - existence of opposite magnetic polarities that do not cancel completely within the resolution element ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and/or from hyperfine - structure effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we also need to apply `` new '' diagnostic techniques based on physical mechanisms whose observable signatures do not suffer from cancellation effects .",
    "two such mechanisms are the hanle effect and the line broadening by the zeeman effect ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we argue that the hanle effect can be suitably _ complemented _ with the zeeman broadening of the intensity profiles of some carefully selected near - ir lines , as a tool to obtain information on the distribution of tangled magnetic fields at sub - resolution scales in the quiet regions of the solar photosphere .",
    "in particular , we will review in some detail how the most recent advances in the application of the hanle effect to solar physics has led us to the conclusion that the hidden magnetic fields of the quiet sun carry a vast amount of unsigned flux and energy .    in sect .  2 we highlight some of the most recent investigations on the magnetism of the quiet sun based on the interpretation of zeeman polarization signals .",

    "3 we consider the hanle effect in the 4607  line , showing how the observed scattering polarization amplitudes suggest the presence of a tangled magnetic field at sub - resolution scales , with a mean field strength @xmath2 g . in sect .  4",

    "6 we review the work done on the hanle effect in molecular lines , pointing out some key questions ( e.g. , the fact that the inferred @xmath4 g ) , whose answer led us to the conclusion that the strength of the hidden field `` fluctuates '' on the spatial scales of solar granulation , with rather weak fields above the granular regions , but with a distribution of stronger fields in the intergranular regions ( capable of producing saturation of the hanle effect in the 4607  line formed there ) . finally , in sect .  7 we summarize the main conclusions and discuss possible lines of future research",
    "over the last few years the observational and theoretical evidence of small - scale mixtures of weak and strong fields in the quiet sun has increased considerably ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "for example , @xcite interpret the systematic difference between the flux densities measured in the 6301.5/6302.5  lines as evidence for small - scale magnetic structures with intrinsic field strengths larger than 1 kg , occupying 2% of the solar surface .",
    "this would imply an abundance of kg fields in the internetwork regions of the sun significantly larger than that inferred by @xcite from measurements of the stokes profiles in the lines at 15648  and 15652 .    concerning proxy magnetometry , it is important to mention that @xcite measured a surface density of internetwork bright points ( ibp ) of 0.02mm@xmath5 in sharp g - band images obtained with the dutch open telescope , and concluded that the observed ibps seem to outline mesogranular cell - like structures .",
    "@xcite reported instead that in their best g - band image ( which contained a small network patch ) obtained with the 1-m swedish solar telescope , the density of bright points is 0.3mm@xmath5 , which led them to conclude that detected bright points cover 0.7% of the solar surface .",
    "recently , @xcite has suggested that the application of stenflo s ( @xcite ) line - ratio technique to the observed stokes-@xmath6 profiles produced by the zeeman effect in the 6301.5/6302.5  lines could overestimate the fraction of ( internetwork ) quiet sun occupied by field strengths @xmath7 kg ( see also figs .  1 and 2 in @xcite ) , because these lines do not have exactly the same absorption coefficient or the same behavior in the dynamic and highly inhomogenous solar atmosphere @xcite .",

    "we point out that with such a maxwellian pdf for the _ downflowing plasma _ , most of the magnetic energy is carried by chaotic fields with strengths between the equipartition field values and @xmath0 kg .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached with other plausible choices for the intergranular pdf ( e.g. , a gaussian ) , in so far that they satisfy the following constraints :    1 .   to produce saturation of the hanle effect in the 4607  line ; 2 .   to produce a zeeman broadening of the intensity profiles of carefully - selected near - ir lines that is compatible with the observations .    obviously , with the hanle effect we can not distinguish between two magnetic field strengths having @xmath39 ( where @xmath142 g for the 4607  line ) .",
    "for this reason , it is important to emphasize that a suitable way of constraining the parameters of the functional form chosen for the intergranular pdf is via a careful analysis of the zeeman broadening of the _ intensity profiles _ of some carefully - selected near - ir lines that we have observed with the tenerife infrared polarimeter .",

    "correctly _ the amplitude of the zero - field linear polarization for each mgh line , which is produced by radiation scattering in the inhomogeneous solar photosphere . fortunately , this 3d modeling of scattering polarization is feasible , since a two - level molecular model for each particular mgh line provides a reliable approximation .",
    "in fact , @xcite have recently solved the 3d scattering polarization problem in each of the 37 unblended mgh lines that show significant @xmath33 amplitudes in the second solar spectrum atlas of @xcite .",
    "their radiative transfer approach is similar to that pursued by @xcite for the 4607  line , adopting a realistic 3d model of the solar photosphere as it results from the hydrodynamic simulations of solar surface convection by @xcite .",
    "the aim was to investigate which combinations of field strengths and collisional depolarizing rates produce polarization amplitudes in agreement with the mgh observations of @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that there are two possible regimes that lead to comparable best fits to the observed scattering polarization amplitudes :    1 .   a case dominated by collisional depolarization , but with the possibility of a weak microturbulent field whose strength can not be much larger than 10 or 20 g ( concerning the case of a single value field ) , in order to preserve the goodness of the best fit;g is obtained when the einstein coefficients given by @xcite are used , while assuming that kurucz s @xmath46-values are more accurate ( as claimed by bommier ; private communication ) then the approximate _ upper limit _ would be 20 g ( which is still a factor 3 smaller than the mean field strength inferred via 3d modeling of the 4607  line polarization ) . ] 2 .   a strongly magnetized case characterized by a microturbulent field with strength greater than a few @xmath146 g , which nevertheless requires a small amount of collisional depolarization in order to attain the best fit .",
    "given that the observed scattering polarization comes mainly from the ( granular ) upflowing regions of the quiet solar photosphere , and that it is unrealistic to think that such regions are filled by a tangled magnetic field stronger than 100 g , @xcite opted for the first case dominated by collisional depolarization .",
    "interestingly , this case is also characterized by relatively weak fields ( see note 10 ) , so that it is compatible with the result of @xmath143 g that was obtained directly via the application of the hanle - effect line - ratio technique for the c@xmath99 lines of the swan system .",
    "that result , however , was based on the assumption that collisional depolarization is unimportant for the upper levels of c@xmath99 lines .",
    "if this were not the case , then the inferred mean field strength would be larger , given that in reality the magnetic field strength required to produce a sizable hanle depolarization is approximately given by ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "therefore , it seems that , while collisional depolarization is essential for the mgh lines , in order to retrieve @xmath149 g , for the same reason it must be insignificant for the c@xmath99 lines .",
    "we think that this is actually the case , given that c@xmath99 is a homonuclear molecule in which collisional transitions between levels @xmath110 and @xmath150 are strictly forbidden ( see pages 131 and 238 of @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , as suggested by fig .  9 ,",
    "this type of collisional transitions between nearby but different @xmath110-levels pertaining to the same vibrational and electronic state are probably the main cause of any collisional depolarization possibly occurring in the other molecular lines of the second solar spectrum .",
    "a joint analysis of the hanle effect in molecular lines and in the 4607  line leads to the conclusion that there is a vast amount of `` hidden '' magnetic energy and ( unsigned ) magnetic flux in the internetwork regions of the quiet solar photosphere , carried mainly by rather chaotic fields in the ( intergranular ) downflowing plasma with strengths @xmath151 g .",
    "this result , complemented with the ( upper - limit ) constraint imposed by our analysis of the zeeman broadening of the intensity profiles of carefully selected near - ir lines , suggests that most of this energy is actually carried by tangled magnetic fields at sub - resolution scales with strengths between the equipartition field values and @xmath0 kg . this hidden magnetic energy in the internetwork regions of the quiet sun is larger than that corresponding to the kg fields of the supergranulation network , and is more than sufficient to compensate the radiative energy losses of the solar outer atmosphere @xcite .",

    "the presence of all these small - scale magnetic fields in the quiet solar photosphere might have several important consequences for the overlying solar atmosphere , such as ubiquity of reconnecting current sheets and heating processes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "therefore , it is now even more important to carry out detailed empirical investigations on the magnetism of the `` quiet '' solar chromosphere via a clever exploitation of a variety of subtle physical mechanisms by means of which a magnetic field can create and destroy spectral line polarization ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "<S> this paper reviews some of the most recent advances in the application of the hanle effect to solar physics , and how these developments are allowing us to explore the magnetism of the photospheric regions that look `` empty '' in solar magnetograms  that is , the sun s `` hidden '' magnetism . in particular , we show how a joint analysis of the hanle effect in atomic and molecular lines indicates that there is a vast amount of hidden magnetic energy and unsigned magnetic flux localized in the ( intergranular ) downflowing regions of the quiet solar photosphere , carried mainly by tangled fields at sub - resolution scales with strengths between the equipartition field values and @xmath0 kg . </S>"
