    "the common way of implementing time dependence in the models of random graphs is to couple the time and the number of edges in such a way that , starting with an empty graph with a given number of vertices , a new edge is added uniformly at random to one of the vacant edge locations at each time step .",
    "this procedure is known simply as the _ graph process _ @xcite . during the past few years , a large variety of models generalizing the graph process have appeared in the physics literature ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) , most of them motivated by the structure of the internet and the world wide web",
    ". one of the central ideas of these models is known , by the work of barbasi and albert @xcite , as preferential attachment . in the barabsi - albert model",
    "new vertices are introduced one at a time and joined to one of the existing vertices chosen with probability proportional to the _ degree _ of the vertex , i.e.  the number of edges already joined to it .",
    "this preferential attachment leads to what price @xcite calls cumulative advantage , and it can be used to construct so - called scale - free networks , i.e. graphs with power - law distributed degrees .    in the graph process and the barabsi - albert model , the edges , once attached to the vertices ,",
    "retain their positions _",
    "ad infinitum_. in the present article , we consider what happens if internal restructuring by rewiring of the graph with the existing edges dominates the dynamics , that is , the time scales associated with addition and removal of edges and vertices , have become very long as compared to the times between the rewiring events .",
    "the dynamics is taken to be the simplest possible capable of providing the cumulative advantage - namely of zero - range @xcite so that the rate of a rewiring event , i.e.  a jump of an edge end from one vertex to another , depends only on the degree of either the initial or the final vertex of the move .",
    "we focus on the connectivity properties of the graphs in the stationary state .",
    "the question about the existence and size of the giant component , a connected cluster occupying a macroscopic fraction of vertices , turns out particularly interesting because of the condensation phenomena induced by the zero - range processes .",
    "closely related models have been studied on a phenomenological level by palla _",

    "we take bipartite multigraphs as the state space of the problem so that the system consists of external agents with static degrees and another set of vertices , for example collaboration events , on which the movement of the edge ends , coming from the set of agents , takes place . a process with unipartite states",
    "is obtained as a special case to our model , but its behavior is not as rich as in the bipartite version .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows : in the following section , we give a precise definition of the model and discuss the reasons for choosing the particular state space .",

    "initially , the @xmath17 edge ends are chosen to be distributed uniformly and independently of each other on the vertices in @xmath0 .",
    "the restructuring of the graph takes place in continuous time by jumps of the edge ends on this set .",
    "we take the process on @xmath0 to be a zero - range process @xcite with @xmath4 particles of type @xmath5 ( edges to vertices of degree @xmath5 in @xmath1 ) and @xmath18 particles of type @xmath7 ( edges to vertices of degree @xmath7 in @xmath1 ) , so that a vertex @xmath13 loses a randomly chosen edge end after an exponentially distributed time , where the parameter of the exponential distribution is a function of the degree of @xmath19 .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath13 is an endvertex of @xmath15 edges to vertices of degree @xmath5 and of @xmath16 edges to vertices of degree @xmath7 , the exponential rate is given by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a given positive function with bounded increments , and the edge end to jump is one of those leading to vertices of degree @xmath5 with probability @xmath22 and one of those leading to vertices of degree @xmath7 otherwise . immediately after leaving the vertex @xmath19 , the edge end joins one of the other vertices according to a symmetric , irreducible transition matrix @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "the stationary distribution of this zero - range process can be found explicitly and will be studied in the next section .",
    "clearly , the stationary distribution of the corresponding bipartite multigraph -valued process is such that all the states with the same degree sequence are equiprobable .    in this article",
    ", we study the structure of the graphs in the stationary state of the process .",
    "in particular , we concentrate on the properties of the projection of the bipartite graph , also called one - mode network @xcite , on the set @xmath0 , obtained by adding an edge between two vertices in @xmath0 if one can be reached from the other by traversing two edges on the original bipartite graph , see fig .  [ fig1](b ) . in other words ,",
    "the projection tells us how the vertices in @xmath0 are mutually connected by the vertices of the other type .",
    "the particular questions we ask are then , when does a giant component , a connected subgraph of size proportional to @xmath25 , exist on the projection and precisely of how many vertices such a component is made ?",
    "there are several reasons for making the particular choices concerning the state space .",
    "first of all , the zero - range dynamics is easily implemented in this setting and it contains the unipartite model as the special case @xmath26 .",
    "the bipartite structure really brings something more to the theory : the @xmath4 vertices of degree @xmath5 are dangling ends from the point of view of connectivity , and do not appear on the projection graph , but they do have influence on the jump rates of the zero - range process .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 controls the amount of this dark matter and lowering its value while keeping @xmath28 fixed corresponds to diluting the set of edges on the projection",
    ". therefore it will be referred to as a dilution parameter .",
    "varying the values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 simultaneously in such a way that their product remains constant can be used to sweep the phase diagram of the underlying particle system , characterized by the density @xmath30 alone , without changing the density of edges on the projection . in addition",
    ", the restriction of the static degrees to at most @xmath7 allows us to use the usual configuration model @xcite , and therefore the results of molloy and reed @xcite , directly without going through the proofs in the bipartite setting .",
    "moreover , we believe that the extension that allows higher but bounded degrees or even degree distributions with exponential tails does not change the qualitative features of the phase diagrams or the values of the critical exponents .",
    "let the dynamics of the edge ends on the set @xmath0 be as described in the previous section and let @xmath31 be the set of ordered partitions of two numbers @xmath4 and @xmath18 both in @xmath25 non - negative parts .",
    "then , for @xmath32 , one shows by verifying that the detailed balance condition holds that the stationary ( canonical ) distribution of the zero - range process is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a generalized factorial with the convention that @xmath35 and @xmath36 is a normalization factor ( canonical partition function ) .",
    "let @xmath37 denote the number of vertices in @xmath0 with exactly @xmath38 edges leading to vertices of degree @xmath5 and @xmath39 edges leading to vertices of degree @xmath7 .",
    "then ( [ mu ] ) implies an image measure @xmath40 for the joint random variable @xmath41 in the stationary regime . in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) , @xmath42 is such that the three conditions @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are satisfied",
    ". otherwise @xmath46 vanishes .",
    "our purpose is to get a grip of the random variables @xmath47 , i.e.  the numbers of vertices of degree @xmath39 on the projection to @xmath0 .",
    "more formally , @xmath48 is the asymptotic degree sequence of molloy and reed @xcite in our problem and we have to show that , with high probability @xcite , we get an asymptotic degree sequence @xmath49 , which is in their sense well - behaved ( see appendix [ appa ] for definitions and discussion ) . because of the constraints on @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) , the random variables @xmath37 are not independent , and it would be difficult to extract the behavior of @xmath50 from the measure @xmath46 directly .",
    "next we are going to construct a sequence of independent variables that is shown to be a good approximation for the original sequence .",
    "in other words , we shall study the problem in the grand canonical ensemble and prove that the canonical and grand canonical ensembles are equivalent .    for zero - range processes , approximations by independent variables",
    "have been considered by grokinsky _",
    "et al_.  @xcite and jeon _ et al_.  @xcite . in their highly influential article , jeon _",
    "et al_.  were able to give a rigorous proof for the behavior of the largest cluster not only for subcritical processes and for the cases with @xmath51 in what is sometimes called evans interaction @xcite , @xmath52 , but also for a large class of vanishing rates . within this class , which essentially consists of functions that vanish faster than @xmath53",
    ", a single vertex would hold all but of the order @xmath54 edge ends in our model , so that the projection of the graph would be in a flower - like state with one vertex having many self - loops .",
    "we choose to study the vanishing cases no further . by restricting ourselves to the cases with the interaction function @xmath21 bounded away from zero",
    ", we also avoid the truncation of the series involved in the grand canonical analysis .",
    "the phase diagram of the evans model was also discussed by grokinsky _",
    "et al_.  and heuristic arguments , supported by simulation results , for the dynamics of condensation were given .",
    "the results of these articles concerning the evans interaction will be applied in later sections .",
    "the general method and the validity of approximations by independent variables is discussed in a delightful paper of arratia and tavar @xcite .",
    "let now @xmath21 be bounded away from zero and let @xmath55 , @xmath56 , be independent @xmath57-distributed random variables , where @xmath58 @xmath59 and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are real parameters whose values will be determined later . here",
    "@xmath62 is the grand canonical partition function .",
    "its radius of convergence , which we shall denote by @xmath63 , is positive because @xmath21 is bounded away from zero . in order to avoid cumbersome expressions",
    ", we set @xmath64 then one can show by a direct calculation that @xmath65 in law and , because of cancellation in the conditional probabilities , independent of the values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "so @xmath66 really is a candidate for a good approximation .",
    "the construction suggests the following for the approximative system :    1 .",
    "a direct calculation shows that the system size @xmath67 is a @xmath68-distributed random variable .",
    "2 .   again by a direct computation , for @xmath69 , @xmath70 in that @xmath71 in law , with the variables @xmath72 independent and distributed according to the grand canonical distribution @xmath73 in other words , @xmath74 controls the vertex degrees locally .",
    "the expectation of a @xmath74-distributed variable will be denoted by @xmath75 : @xmath76 the parameter @xmath61 is known as the fugacity .",
    "3 .   in a similar manner one shows that @xmath77 so that , given @xmath78 and @xmath79 , the number of edges leading to vertices of degree equal to unity has the binomial distribution with parameters @xmath17 and @xmath80 .",
    "now suppose that one would like to get an exponentially decaying upper bound for the probability of an event @xmath81 concerning the dependent variables @xmath82 , and let @xmath83 be the same event for the independent variables @xmath66 .",
    "suppose further that the parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 can be chosen in such a way that the probability of the conditioning event @xmath84 is not exponentially small .",
    "then it suffices to get the upper bound for the independent case : @xmath85 .",
    "the use of this conditioning device is nicely illustrated in the articles of corteel _",
    "et al_.  @xcite and jeon _",
    "et al_.  @xcite .    how to best choose the values of the parameters ?",
    "the point @xmath5 in the list above tells that the approximative system size @xmath67 is sharply peaked at @xmath86 with a standard deviation of @xmath87 so that the simplest choice is to match the parameter with the size of the canonical system @xmath25 . notice that the choice is not unique because terms of the order @xmath88 could be added without affecting the behavior in the large system size limit .",
    "the points @xmath7 and @xmath89 in the list show that , with the appropriate conditionings , the same type of argument applies to the two other random variables in the conditions ( [ conditions ] ) as well .",
    "we thus set @xmath90 and , if possible , @xmath91 clearly , the first two equations can always be fulfilled but in the third one the case @xmath92 marks a condensation transition . roughly speaking ,",
    "the best one can do in that case is to set @xmath93 , so that locally one observes degrees distributed according to @xmath94 , just like in a system with density @xmath95 .",
    "then the rest of the mass , that is @xmath96 edges , must hide in the @xmath88-sets of vertices since those edge ends are not picked up by the approximating measure .",
    "it was proven in refs .",
    "@xcite that this really is the true picture and , furthermore , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite claim that the set of @xmath88 vertices with the rest of the mass is in fact a single vertex for a large class of rate functions .",
    "especially , the evans model , which we shall study in section [ secevans ] , belongs to this class . as a by - product of the discussion above",
    ", we get something really important to the theory . from the point of view of our application the condensates for vanishing rates and the ones bounded away from zero are completely different : in the first case , the components on the flower - like projection graph are very small , while in the second , the condensate on a single vertex implies the existence of a giant component .    recall that @xmath47 is the number of vertices of degree @xmath39 on the projection , so that @xmath97 is an independent approximation for this quantity .",
    "we define @xmath98 which equals the expected value of @xmath99 divided by the system size . to show that the conditions of molloy and reed are satisfied ,",
    "we first prove that the fluctuations @xmath99 around @xmath100 are not too large . the following inequality is rather easily obtained for any @xmath101 using chernoff s bounds ( see e.g.  @xcite ) : @xmath102 where @xmath103 , with @xmath104 , is strictly increasing . using here the trivial bound @xmath105 and the fact that @xmath106 yields that , with high probability for any @xmath107 , @xmath108 in order to get the estimates for the original sequence , one has to bound @xmath109 from below .",
    "let us now derive a subexponential lower bound for the probability of the conditioning event in the subcritical cases @xmath110 .",
    "notice first that with the choices made in eqs .",
    "( [ setalphar ] ) and using the results for the variables in @xmath78 and @xmath111 , the probability of @xmath78 is bounded below by @xmath112 for some constant @xmath113 and also @xmath114 .",
    "so we have to bound the probability of @xmath79 given @xmath78 . by subcriticality and from the fact that @xmath115 is strictly increasing",
    "it follows that there is a unique @xmath116 for every value of the density such that eq .",
    "( [ setphi ] ) is satisfied and the distribution @xmath74 therefore has an exponential tail",
    ". therefore the usual local limit theorem @xcite applies and the probability is at least @xmath117 . thus @xmath118 and the bound ( [ cnfluct ] ) for the fluctuations of @xmath99 applies to @xmath50 as well .",
    "moreover , the tail of @xmath119 is exponentially thin because @xmath120 and @xmath74 shows exponential decay .",
    "also , since @xmath121 , for some @xmath122 and large @xmath39 , the largest degree is @xmath123 with high probability .",
    "now it is easy to check that , with high probability , the degree sequence @xmath124 is such that the conditions of molloy and reed , reproduced in appendix [ appa ] , are satisfied .",
    "next we give the results for the subcritical cases .",
    "let @xmath125 and @xmath126 and define @xmath127 then , the parts of theorem @xmath5 of ref .",
    "@xcite concerning the existence of the giant component and theorem @xmath5 of ref .",

    "if @xmath130 , there is exactly one component on the projection with more than @xmath131 vertices for some constant @xmath132 , and the size of that component is @xmath133 , where @xmath134 and @xmath135 is the positive solution to @xmath136    notice that , since @xmath137 is a convex function of @xmath135 on @xmath138 , eq .",
    "( [ beta ] ) has a unique positive solution exactly when @xmath139 .",
    "we can also deduce the leading order of @xmath140 as a function of @xmath141 : the expansion of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ beta ] ) for small @xmath135 ( all the derivatives of @xmath142 exist because @xmath116 ) yields @xmath143 as @xmath144 from above , so that now expanding the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) to the first order in @xmath135 we have @xmath145 thus the growth starts linearly .",
    "furthermore , the uniqueness of the solution to eqs .",
    "( [ delta ] ) and ( [ beta ] ) allows us to calculate the leading order of @xmath140 when the critical curve is crossed by increasing the density @xmath30 with constant @xmath29 . at the point @xmath146 with @xmath147",
    ", we get @xmath148 for the size of the giant component .",
    "note that , in case of a finite radius of convergence @xmath63 of the partition function , the @xmath149 limits of the amplitudes in expressions ( [ deltalin ] ) and ( [ deltalin2 ] ) depend crucially on the existence of the third moment of a @xmath150-distributed random variable .      as a first example , let us study the case of non - interacting random walks .",
    "then @xmath151 and @xmath152 , so that from eqs .  ( [ defphi],[setphi ] ) and from the definition of the critical density of the zero - range process , eq .  (",
    "[ rhoc ] ) , we get that @xmath153 and @xmath154 . also , from eq .",
    "( [ rc ] ) , it follows that @xmath155 , for @xmath156 , and there is no phase transition for @xmath157 ( remember that @xmath158 $ ] ) . of course , by @xmath159 we mean @xmath160 with @xmath161 the solution to eq .",
    "( [ setphi ] ) . setting @xmath162 one recovers the results familiar from the model @xmath163 of random graphs @xcite : the phase transition occurs at @xmath164 and the size of the giant component is @xmath133 with @xmath140 given by the solution to @xmath165 . furthermore , eq .",
    "( [ deltalin ] ) is consistent with the known expansion @xmath166 for @xmath167 .    in our second example",
    "we take the jump rates to be degree independent , @xmath168 .",
    "now the partition function has a finite radius of convergence , @xmath169 , but still there is no condensation transition , so that @xmath170 .",
    "in this case we have @xmath171 , for @xmath172 , and no transition for smaller densities .",
    "quite surprisingly , the size of the giant component has a simple expression @xmath173 from which , again in harmony with eq .",
    "( [ deltalin ] ) , we get @xmath174 , for @xmath175 .",
    "the critical curve can be alternatively written in terms of the function @xmath176 defined in eq .",
    "( [ defphi ] ) : @xmath177 from which it follows that @xmath178 the fact that the equation for the critical curve involves the second derivative of the partition function , or equivalently the first derivative of @xmath179 , already tells that the phase diagram of the graph - valued process can be more complicated than for the zero - range process itself , in which the existence of the phase transition is simply dictated by the asymptotics of the ratio @xmath180 .",
    "three different kinds of behavior can be extracted from the results ( [ rc ] ) and ( [ rcalt ] ) :    1 .   when @xmath181 as @xmath149 , i.e @xmath95 is infinite , the critical curve decreases to zero as a function @xmath30 in such a way that @xmath182 for @xmath30 arbitrarily large .",
    "the high density asymptotic behavior of the curve is either @xmath183 or given by the nontrivial part in the denominator of ( [ rcalt ] ) .",
    "this point will be explored further shortly .",
    "when the first derivative of the partition function converges as @xmath184 , in that @xmath95 is finite , but the second derivative diverges , we have a condensation transition , and the critical curve approaches zero as @xmath30 tends to @xmath95 from below .",
    "therefore , a giant component exists at and above the zero - range critical point for any non - zero @xmath29 . near the condensation transition , where @xmath61 is just below @xmath63 , the critical curve goes like @xmath185 3 .   if also the second derivative of the partition function converges , @xmath186 is non - zero .",
    "in fact , the values of the dilution parameter @xmath29 being restricted to the unit interval , this case is further divided into two categories according to whether this non - zero limiting value is greater or less than @xmath5 . for @xmath187 ,",
    "no phase transition can be achieved by varying the dilution parameter @xmath29 . in both cases , however , if the condensation occurs on a single vertex , we know that above @xmath95 there is a giant component , but the theory developed so far tells nothing about its existence exactly at the zero - range critical point .",
    "these three points illustrate the shape of the critical curve at the high density limit .",
    "we remark that , for small values of @xmath30 , the curve is expected to pick up the features of the non - interacting case @xmath151 , provided that @xmath188 .",
    "an example of a concrete phase diagram , with all the features discussed here , will be given in section [ secevans ] .",
    "we saw that the interactions in the two examples of section [ secexamples ] produced critical curves inversely proportional to the density .",
    "let us now deduce , for which functions @xmath21 this proportionality holds , at least for densities high enough .",
    "for this purpose , set @xmath189 with @xmath190 , in ( [ rcalt ] ) .",
    "this yields a linearizable first order differential equation for @xmath179 , with the initial condition @xmath191 , the solution to which is @xmath192 where @xmath193 for @xmath194 and @xmath195 otherwise .",
    "furthermore , solving for @xmath142 from eq .",
    "( [ defphi ] ) , we get @xmath196 which has the expansion @xmath197 so that @xmath198 this form of interaction function covers a range of models , which we now classify for different values of @xmath199 :    for @xmath200 or @xmath7 we get the examples of section [ secexamples ] .    for @xmath201 , the tail of @xmath202 , which determines the high density behavior , can be expanded in powers of @xmath203 : @xmath204 where @xmath205 , and we have chosen @xmath206 to make the radius of convergence equal to unity . to leading order in the large @xmath207 limit , @xmath202 is then given by @xmath208 where @xmath209 .    in the first case of @xmath210 , which interpolates between the cases of non - interacting edges and the degree independent rates ,",

    "thus , we predict @xmath219 for high densities in the evans model with @xmath220 and",
    "something else for the rest of the phase diagram .",
    "this model is known to exhibit a condensation transition for @xmath221 , in which case our critical curve @xmath222 will hit zero at @xmath95 .",
    "the region @xmath223 is therefore special - the critical curve is strictly above zero , but falls of faster than the first inverse power in @xmath30 .",
    "this seems to be consistent with the observation of grokinsky et al .",
    "@xcite that a kind of precursor of condensation transition is present on this interval of the parameter space",

    "indeed , at @xmath289 , @xmath290 leading to a logarithmic correction to the first inverse power law .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath291 , condensation does not occur , but we see a drastic change in the behavior of the critical curve , @xmath292 in that it decays with a @xmath211-dependent exponent greater than @xmath5 .",

    "what is important is that , by the subcriticality in the zero - range sense , the growth of the giant component is linear in the vicinity of the phase transition , i.e.  the critical exponent for the size of the giant component equals unity .",
    "there is a finite zero - range critical density @xmath295 for @xmath296 , but the second derivative of the partition function @xmath142 , i.e.  the second factorial moment of a @xmath74-distributed variable , still diverges in the limit @xmath297 .",

    "the critical curve for @xmath318 is of the same type as for the @xmath319 in the sense that it approaches zero as @xmath30 tends to @xmath95 .",
    "the linear transformation formula being not valid for integer @xmath211 , one has to deal with the exact expressions for the derivatives of the partition function .",
    "this implies the conjecture @xmath320 for the critical growth as @xmath310 , i.e.  an infinite order transition .",
    "now we enter the region @xmath321 , nearly half of which allows a rigorous analysis . strictly speaking ,",
    "we do nt even know the exact position of the phase transition for @xmath322 at @xmath283 .",
    "this is because the limit of the critical curve @xmath285 as @xmath297 is greater than zero by the existence of the second moment of a @xmath254-distributed variable .",
    "more precisely , we have @xmath323 , this holding for all @xmath51 , so that , by @xmath295 , the end points define a curve @xmath324 on the @xmath325-plane .",
    "below @xmath276 , the transition curves are vertical and the giant component can be born only through condensation of edges . the way the curves",
    "@xmath222 approach the zero - range critical point can again be evaluated , @xmath326 the curve d of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows an example with @xmath327 . in the figure , the curve p drawn with a dotted line is @xmath276 , the curve of limiting points of @xmath285 .",
    "for @xmath328 we can now prove that , at @xmath329 as @xmath330 from above , @xmath331 thus giving the exponent @xmath317 , exactly the inverse of the exponent for the critical curve .",
    "remember that for @xmath319 we conjectured @xmath311 for @xmath140 but @xmath332 for @xmath159 , so that no such relation is valid for small values of @xmath211 .",
    "the case @xmath333 again involves logarithms .",
    "we have two types of critical behavior to deal with left .",
    "the first one , occurring in the region @xmath334 , can be seen as a continuation to the preceding interval , since the endpoints of @xmath285 lie on the curve @xmath276 with values strictly less than one because @xmath335 .",
    "the change is in the exponents : near the zero - range criticality we have @xmath336 in that @xmath285 forms a cusp with the vertical line at @xmath95 ( see the curve e with @xmath337 in fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we recover the linear growth of the giant component , that we predicted already from the subcritical analysis in formula ( [ deltalimits ] ) , @xmath338    the region in the phase diagram that we have not yet discussed is @xmath339 .",
    "but this is trivial , since @xmath340 for all values @xmath341 , and the phase transition curves are vertical lines positioned at the critical density of the zero - range process ( curve f in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . in other words ,",
    "no giant component can exist without a condensate of edge ends on one of the vertices .",
    "we remark that the critical exponents for the growth of the giant component at the condensation point are exactly the same as obtained recently by cohen _",
    "et al_.  @xcite for diluted scale - free networks .",
    "this is not a coincidence : in their model , from a random graph with a given power - law degree distribution , a fraction of the vertices with all the edges joined to them are removed . for the vertices retained in the graph",
    "this means that their degree distribution is transformed exactly in the same manner as the distribution for the vertices in @xmath0 in the operation of removing the dangling ends from our bipartite graph .",
    "the distribution @xmath342 corresponding to the critical density being heavy - tailed , the similarity between the two problems is obvious . in the dynamical model",
    ", however , we have to deal with the fluctuations and , as the analysis shows , they are not always easily controlled .",
    "we studied the existence and size of the giant component on one of the vertex sets in a dynamical model for bipartite multigraphs using the results of molloy and reed @xcite .",
    "motivated by the concept of preferential attachment , we defined the movement of the edge ends on one side of the bipartite graph to be a zero - range process with jump rates bounded away from zero , in the stationary state of which only weak correlations exist .",
    "a simple approximation by independent random variables allowed us to bound the fluctuations , and show that the degree sequences obtained this way are well - behaved in the sense of molloy and reed for zero - range processes with density below the critical value for condensation .",
    "as a benchmark , it was shown that the case of non - interacting edge ends produced the well - known results of the @xmath343-model of random graphs .",
    "generally , we find four types of critical curves , depending on the asymptotics of the derivatives of the grand canonical partition function near the radius of convergence . a class of rate functions , for which the curves are of the same type as for the independent walkers , was also identified .",
    "the last sections of the article were devoted to the evans interaction , showing all the four types of phase diagrams as the parameter of the interaction is varied .",
    "our simple use of the conditioning device was strong enough to access some nontrivial parts of the parameter space but did not allow us to show that the conditions of molloy and reed are satisfied for all values of the interaction parameter exactly at the zero - range condensation point .",
    "the critical exponents for the growth of the giant component were given as conjectures supported by monte carlo simulations in those cases . in the end , we discussed the connection with the model of diluted scale - free networks @xcite .",
    "this implies that our model with the evans interaction and exactly at the zero - range condensation point belongs to the universality class of percolation on graphs with power - law distributed degrees .",
    "the same set of exponents appears also in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a general , phenomenological landau theory for phase transitions on scale - free networks is constructed .",
    "the simulation results suggest that the simple landau theory is not broken by the fluctuations in our model .",
    "finally , we would like to mention a few points that would be interesting to analyze further .",
    "first of all , our simple approximations by independent variables failed to give estimates sharp enough to completely cover the parts of the parameter space with condensates for the evans interaction .",
    "we believe that the problem is purely technical and could be removed by more sophisticated use of the conditioning device .",
    "secondly , no results inside the phase transition , i.e.  no further than @xmath344 from the critical point , exist for graphs with a general degree sequence .",
    "therefore , the behavior near @xmath345 remains to be discovered .",
    "what comes to the underlying particle system , there are still open questions even concerning the statics of zero - range processes , especially for rate functions exhibiting slow decay @xcite .",
    "furthermore , only stationary properties of the model were discussed in this article .",
    "recently , advances have been made towards understanding the formation of condensates in zero - range processes as a function of time @xcite , so that one is tempted to consider the temporal scalings for graph - valued processes as well .",
    "a grand canonical generalization of the present model that would allow for a variable number of external agents would also be of interest .",
