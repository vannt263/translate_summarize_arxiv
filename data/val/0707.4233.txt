    "landauer s principle [ [ landuer1 ] ] states that any logically irreversible operation on information , such as the erasure of a bit or the merging of two computation paths , is always associated with an increase of entropy of the non - information bearing degrees of freedom of the information processing apparatus or its environment [ [ bennet ] ] and consequently each bit of lost information will lead to the release of at least @xmath0 amount of heat .",
    "but it is well known that most of the commonly used classical gates ( except not and identity ) are irreversible and they erase at least one bit of information in every operation .",
    "thus the irreversible logic gates will always release some heat energy . on the other hand ,",
    "moore s law states that the number of transistors in a chip gets doubled in every 18 months .",
    "therefore , if we continue to design chips with the help of conventional irreversible logic gates then the lower limit of power loss will continue to increase .",
    "this led to the idea of reversible computation and reversible logic .",
    "since quantum mechanics is essentially reversible , quantum mechanical processes appeared as good candidate to construct reversible gates and these gates are known as quantum gates . when we glue some of these gates we obtain a quantum circuit .",
    "after introduction of the idea of quantum computation it has already been seen that there exist some quantum algorithms [ [ the : nielsen and chuang ] ] which works much faster than their classical counter parts , there exists infinitely secured quantum cryptographic protocol [ [ crypto1 ] , [ crypto2 ] ] ; there exists protocol for quantum teleportation [ [ the : cerf - teleportation ] ] and all these processes which establish quantum computing as a superior future technology involves quantum circuits and quantum gates .",
    "it has also been seen that it is possible to design classical reversible gates and classical reversible circuits but since they can not handle superposition of states ( qubit ) they just form special cases of quantum circuit or a subset of the set of the quantum circuits . but from the construction point of view they are easy to build . keeping this background in mind it is reasonable to state that all novel applications of reversible / quantum computation essentially involve reversible / quantum circuits .",
    "a considerable amount of work has already been done in the field of designing and optimization of reversible combinatorial circuit [ [ maslov1]-[ad vos ] ] .",
    "but the designing aspect of reversible sequential circuit is not yet studied rigorously .",
    "this is because of the fact that feedback in a reversible circuit can not be visualized in the usual sense in which feedback is visualized in a conventional irreversible circuit .",
    "this issue was first addressed by toffoli [ [ toffoli ] ] . in [ [ toffoli ] ] he had shown that the reversible sequential circuits can be constructed provided the transition function of the circuit block without the feedback loop is unitary . his ideas on the sequential reversible circuit had further strengthen in his pioneering work on conservative logic [ [ the : toffoli - conservative logic ] ] . later on some efforts",
    "have been made to construct reversible sequential circuit [ [ picton]-[thapiyal2 ] ] .",
    "all these efforts are concentrated on the designing of various flip flops because of the fact that the flip flops are the basic building block of the memory element of a computer and if one wishes to build a reversible classical computer then these designs will play a crucial role . but",
    "several conceptual issues related to designing and optimization of sequential circuits are not addressed till now . in the next section",
    "we address those conceptual issues related to the feedback and the choice of gate library . in section 3",
    "we have described different architectures for flip flops . in section 4",
    "we have compared the circuit architectures proposed in the present work with the existing circuit architectures for the same .",
    "finally we conclude the work in section 5 .",
    "to provide a systematic protocol for designing reversible sequential circuit and to compare the proposed circuit architectures with the existing architectures we need to address certain conceptual issues related to reversible circuit designing . to be precise , conceptual issues related to feedback , choices of gate library and approximate optimization ( local optimization ) techniques will be addressed in the following subsections .      .",
    "it is widely believed that feedback is not allowed in a reversible circuit [ [ vasudevan ] ] .",
    "this is true if we consider feedback in a similar fashion as it is dealt in classical irreversible logic .",
    "the objection against feedback is twofold .",
    "firstly , merging of two computational paths is not allowed in a reversible circuit and secondly , time axis goes from left to right in a reversible circuit ( as shown in fig .",
    "thus if we need to follow the same notion of time axis in a reversible sequential circuit then feedback will essentially mean a journey in negative time axis or existence of time machine .",
    "this is against the notion of physical reality . but these strong objections against feedback in reversible circuit can be circumvented by establishing the equivalence between the circuits in fig .",
    "1a and fig . 1b . to be precise , the feedback loop shown in fig .",
    "1b is only in space not in time .",
    "therefore , the circuit in fig .",
    "1b is equivalent to a cascaded circuit in time axis ( see fig .",
    "thus the usual notion of time axis is not valid in reversible sequential circuit ( i.e. in a circuit having spatial feedback loop similar to one shown in fig .",
    "further , since the circuit in fig .",
    "1b is equivalent to the cascade shown in fig 1a , there is no merging of computational paths and consequently there would not be any loss of energy provided u is unitary .",
    "this conclusion coincides with the toffoli s idea [ [ toffoli ] ] of unitary transition function .",
    "now if we follow , this notion of feedback , then to establish the reversibility of the architecture it would be sufficient to establish the unitarity of u. here we would also like to note that in this restricted notion of spatial feedback we can not allow any arbitrary feedback loop .",
    "an allowed loop has to be reducible to structure shown in fig .",
    "1b .      in the previous subsection",
    "we have shown that in order to design a reversible sequential circuit we have to design u ( in fig .",
    "1b ) as unitary .",
    "now if we know the truth table of  u and wish to decompose u in terms of finite number of logic gates , we can use one of the two existing approaches . in the first approach ,",
    "one designs reversible gates equivalent to irreversible logic gates .",
    "for example , see fig . 2 in which the classical irreversible gates like nand , and , nor etc are replaced by corresponding reversible gates for reversible circuit , constructed by combination of not , cnot and ccnot gates .",
    "in this approach after designing the equivalent gates one can substitute each irreversible gate of a conventional circuit by corresponding equivalent reversible gates and obtain the required reversible circuit .",
    "this straightforward approach is used in earlier works [ [ picton]-[hassan babu ] ] but the application of this approach is limited since it requires an existing reversible circuit and it can not go beyond the limits of classical computation . here",
    "we would like to note that all earlier efforts of designing sequential reversible circuits [ [ picton]-[thapiyal2 ] ] were limited to this approach .",
    "for example , j. e. rice [ [ rice ] ] has substituted nor gate ( present in a conventional irreversible circuit ) by ccnot and has used fredkin gate to generate fanout from the clock .",
    "h. thapiyal [ [ thapiyal2 ] ] has substituted nand gate by new gate and and gate by fredkin gate . in the second approach one",
    "starts with a truth table ( defining the desired logic ) and the gate library and then the corresponding reversible circuits are designed by transforming the inputs into outputs .",
    "unidirectional and bidirectional synthesis algorithms [ [ maslov1 ] ] are example of this approach . in principle",
    "we have followed this approach , but instead of following an existing synthesis algorithm we have developed the designs by utilizing the logical symmetry of the truth table .",
    "for example , a careful look on the truth table of conventional sr flip flop tells us that there is an unstable condition and as @xmath1 is complement of @xmath2 , so both of them can never take same values .",
    "let us consider two cases : ( i ) when clock is high , and the last state is in set condition and ( ii ) when clock is high and the last state is in reset condition . now",
    "if we operate the flip flop in set condition ( i.e. @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) then the state obtained in the output in both of the above cases will be @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "since we obtain same result for two different cases , it always violates bijectivity .",
    "this problem may arise in the circuits designed by the first approach and this fact is reflected in the state table of sr latch reported by rice [ [ rice ] ] .",
    "the truth table provided by rice ( see table v in [ [ rice ] ] ) is not bijective as it gives two different inputs ( 0100 and 0101 ) .",
    "further we would like to note that number of feedback loops present in an irreversible sequential circuit can not be reduced , if we adhere to the first approach .",
    "whichever synthesis algorithm we follow , it is important to define a gate library . the definition of the gate library ( i.e. gates which are the member of that library ) is not well defined and there does not exist any single convention . the physical complexity of gates may not be same in two different implementation of quantum circuits .",
    "for example , it may be easy to build an arbitrary gate a in nmr technology but it may not be that easy in superconductivity based technology .",
    "a n - qubit quantum gate is represented by @xmath7x @xmath7 unitary matrix and product of any arbitrary number of unitary matrices is unitary .",
    "consequently , if we put a set of quantum gates in a black box then an unitary matrix will represent the box and one can technically consider it as a new gate .",
    "if we allow such construction of new gates then any circuit block ( of arbitrary size ) can be reduced to a single new gate , provided it does not contain any measurement operation .",
    "thus it is straightforward to observe that the use of new gate to reduce the gate count ( as it is done in [ [ thapiyal2]-[hassan babu ] ] ) is an artifact . to be precise , we would like to mention that h. thapiyal _",
    "et al _ [ [ thapiyal2]-[thapiyal4 ] ] has introduced new gate , tks gate and tsg gate to reduce the gate complexity of several circuits .",
    "similarly , h. m. hasan babu ( see fig . 7 in [ [ hassan babu ] ] ) has introduced another new gate to reduce the gate count of a full adder circuit .",
    "thus the gate count ( gate complexity ) reported in these works [ [ thapiyal2]-[thapiyal4 ] ] are misleading and consequently we need a logical approach to construct a gate library which in turn will help us to compare more than one circuit designs proposed for the same purpose .    all the 1 qubit gates ( set of all phase gates ) along with any two qubit gate forms an universal set of quantum gates .",
    "since cnot is a two qubit gate , which have been experimentally realized by different groups by using different techniques , it seems logical to construct a gate library whose elements are phase gates and cnot in case of quantum circuit and cnots in case of classical reversible circuits .",
    "this is why we have chosen a gate library which contains not ( n ) , cnot ( c ) and toffoli ( t ) as its element .",
    "this particular choice of gate library ( nct ) is not only logical but also consistent with the existing approaches [ [ maslov1],[ad vos ] ] . since phase gates and cnot forms a set of universal gate",
    ", we can construct toffoli with phase gates and cnot and that requires five gates .",
    "we have used these facts to compare the gate complexity of our designs of sequential circuits with the existing proposals .",
    "the comparison is done with respect to the ( nct ) gate library ( as shown in table i ) and also with respect to the universal gate library , comprising of phase gates and cnot ( as shown in table ii ) .",
    "even if we start with the same truth table and same gate library and use the second approach of synthesis then also different logical paths may lead to different circuits .",
    "we have followed three different logical paths and have obtained three different architectures for every flip flop . after designing a circuit",
    "we need to optimize it but an exact optimization technique s time complexity @xmath8 is [ [ anindita ] ] @xmath9 where , @xmath10 is the number of qubit line present in the circuit , @xmath11 is the total number gate present in the circuit and @xmath12 , is the number of qubit associated with the largest gate present in the gate library .",
    "thus in the present case when the gate library is ( nct ) then @xmath13 and the time complexity of exact optimization algorithm is @xmath14 this increases exponentially with @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in order to avoid this exponential rise in time ,",
    "certain approximate optimization ( local optimization ) algorithms ( e.g. bi - directional algorithm , template matching algorithm ) have been designed and in practice we use them . since the optimization algorithm is an approximate one , it may lead to different circuit architecture but the order of gate complexities have to be the same .",
    "this fact is clearly reflected in the table i and table ii given below .",
    "it is clear from the earlier approaches on reversible circuit designing that there is no unique circuit for a particular purpose and even if we start with the same gate library different synthesis technique may yield different circuit architecture . more importantly ,",
    "if we obtain two different circuit architectures for the same purpose ( which satisfies the same truth table ) by using two different synthesis techniques and then apply same approximate circuit optimization algorithms ( e.g. template matching algorithm , unidirectional algorithm , bi - directional algorithms etc . ) on them it is not essential that the final circuit will be same .",
    "we have used t for toffoli ( ccnot ) gate , f for feynman ( cnot ) gate and",
    "n for not gate .",
    "the sum of @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 gates present in a circuit gives us the gate count or the gate complexity of the circuit .",
    "here we have used a different approach and ( nct ) gate library to design reversible memory elements/ flip flops . to be precise",
    "we have obtained three circuits for sr flip flop , jk flip flop , d flip flop , t flip flop , master slave d flip flop , and master slave jk flip flop . here",
    "@xmath18 refers to first feedback based design , @xmath19 refers to second feedback based design and @xmath20 refers to design without feedback which , mainly uses refresh mechanism except in t flip flop .",
    "we have included all the circuits in the present work because of the fact that no particular design appeared as better than the other .",
    "this fact can be seen clearly from table i where we can see that the third design is best to construct t flip flop but the first design is better as far as construction of sr flip flop is concerned and all three approaches used by us yield better results compared to earlier works with respect to the most logical gate library ( nct ) . the resultant reversible flip flop eliminates the unstable condition found in sr flip flop and also minimizes the number of feedback loops in the jk flip flop and master slave jk flip flop .",
    "the logic of each of the circuit designed is discussed in the following subsections .      [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      +       it is interesting to note that the advantages of our design over the earlier proposals and all other conclusions remained same .",
    "this approach of counting circuit complexity by considering complexity of toffoli as 5 is consistent with the earlier works [ [ maslov1 ] ] .",
    "in section 2 of the present work , we have addressed the conceptual issues related to the designing and optimization of reversible circuits in general with a special attention towards the issues related to the designing of reversible sequential circuits . in this section",
    "we have shown that it is required to define an acceptable gate library and a good choice for that can gate library .",
    "further , it has been shown that the advantage in gate count obtained in some of the earlier proposals by introduction of is an and if it is allowed then every circuit block ( unless there is a measurement ) can be reduced to a single gate .",
    "the important conclusions of section 2 have been used in the next section to design circuits for sr flip flop , jk flip flop , d flip flop , t flip flop , master slave d flip flop and master slave jk flip flop . in section 4",
    "we have seen that our the unstable condition i.e. it always holds the last state but also uses lesser number feedback loops ( i.e. only 2 feedback loops against 4 in conventional jk flip flop ) . in the third design feedback loops",
    "are replaced by application of refresh mechanism on some qubit lines which can also be reduced ( in sr flip flop it can be minimized to 1 refresh operation on qubit line ) but it leads to increase of gate count and consequently it has been avoided in the present work . from the comparison tables",
    "( table i and table ii ) , it is clear that the none of the earlier proposals have lesser gate complexity and lesser number of garbage bits compared to the present proposals .",
    "the sequential circuits described here uses only nct gates and there exist several proposals for realization of cnot and ccnot gates using cmos based technology [ [ vasudevan]-[ad vos ] ] .",
    "thus it is technically possible to construct the proposed reversible sequential circuits with the help of conventional cmos based technology .",
    "consequently , we can easily build classical reversible memory element .",
    "but the implementation of the present work is not limited to classical domain , this is because of the fact that we can also implement the proposed circuits in quantum domain with the help of nmr or quantum dot or optical implementation [ [ the : cerf - teleportation ] ] .",
    "if one aims to provide optimized reversible circuits for all the useful component of a classical computer and then this work along with the proposal of [ [ ad vos ] ] will help him to provide a complete architecture for a classical reversible computer . since it will be free from the problem of decoherence and scalability it seems more practical and easy to built than a real scalable quantum computer .",
