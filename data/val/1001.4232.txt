    "the central parsec of the galaxy harbors more than one hundred young massive stars ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "this is highly surprising , since the tidal forces from the central four million solar mass black hole should make formation of stars by gravitational collapse from a cold interstellar cloud very difficult , if not impossible @xcite .",
    "most of the wr - stars and o - stars ( dwarfs , giants , and supergiants ) dominating the luminosity of the early - type population were formed in a well defined single event @xmath36 myrs ago , perhaps as the result of the infall of a gas cloud followed by an in - situ star formation event . about half of these wr / o - stars between 0.8  and 12  from sgra * reside in a well defined but highly warped and eccentric disk that rotates clockwise on the sky .",
    "there exists a significant ( @xmath5 ) counter - clockwise structure of wr / o stars @xcite , perhaps a second disk in a dissolving state . within about 1  of sgra * there is a sharp cutoff in the density of wr / o - stars .",
    "instead there is a concentration of fainter stars ( b dwarfs ) with randomly oriented and eccentric orbits : the so - called s - star cluster @xcite .",

    "the radial surface density of the clockwise wr / o - stars follows a power law @xmath8 between 0.8  and 15  .",
    "the surface density distribution of the counter - clockwise wr / o - stars is flat between 0.8  and 15  with a larger central hole than the one of the clockwise stars and a shallow maximum at around 4.5  .",
    "the radial surface density profile of b - dwarfs in the magnitude interval @xmath9 drops smoothly from the central 0.8  , where the s - stars reside , out to about 25  .",
    "the distribution is similar to the clockwise wr / o - stars with a best - fitting power law of @xmath10 . in strong contrast to the early - type stars , late - type stars with @xmath11 exhibit a flat surface density distribution inside of 10 ",

    "figure [ fig1 ] ( right ) shows the completeness corrected k - band luminosity functions of early - type stars in three radial intervals together with three theoretical model luminosity functions based on different imfs , computed with the population synthesis code stars @xcite .",
    "we assumed a cluster age of 6 myrs , and an exponentially decaying star burst with an @xmath12 time - scale of 1 myrs .",
    "this is the best - fitting age and duration of a single star formation event derived from the hertzsprung - russell diagram distribution of the o / b - stars and the ratios of various sub - types of wr - stars @xcite .",
    "the klf in the radial interval @xmath6 can be fitted by a power - law imf of @xmath2 ( the salpeter imf is @xmath13 ) .",
    "the imf found by @xcite for their @xmath14 cloud simulation fits our data reasonably well .",
    "the imf of the field early - type stars beyond 12  and the s - stars within 0.8  can be fitted by @xmath4 .",
    "these latter klfs can also be fitted by salpeter / kroupa imfs and continuous star formation histories with moderate ages ( @xmath15 myrs ) .",
    "most of the stars with @xmath16 are b dwarfs , the brighter magnitude bins contain o dwarfs , giants and wr stars .",
    "the main sequence ends at about @xmath17 , corresponding to stars with initial masses of about @xmath18 with main - sequence lifetimes of 6 myr .",
    "an @xmath19 early - type star for a 6 myr old population corresponds approximately to a b5v main sequence star with a zams mass of about @xmath20 ( see figure [ fig1 ] right ) .",
    "the most massive stars with individual mass estimates have zams masses of at least @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "our estimated imf slope of the stellar disks ( @xmath2 ) is therefore at least valid over the mass interval @xmath22 .",
    "50 out of 110 stars with @xmath23 have an angular offset to the local average angular momentum direction of the clockwise system @xcite , below @xmath24 and 8 out of 15 stars with @xmath25 have offsets below @xmath24 .",
    "in contrast , only one out of 11 stars fainter than @xmath26 is compatible with the clockwise disk .",
    "this may be an indication that most of the few later b - dwarfs observed in the region of the disks do not belong to the clockwise system , but rather to the background population seen at projected distances beyond 12  , which has a more standard imf .",
    "the observations suggest that the two wr / o / b - star disks ( or planar sets of streamers ) between 0.8  and 12  are structurally and dynamically distinct from both the s - star cluster and the outer region .",
    "the properties of these warped disks , including in particular their steep surface density distribution , their top - heavy imf ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and their relatively low total stellar masses all strongly favor an in situ star formation model @xcite and broadly agree with the findings of recent hydrodynamical simulations @xcite of star formation triggered by infalling gas clouds . the sharp transition at 0.8  between disk zone and s - star cluster , both in terms of dynamics and mass function , in our opinion also strongly disfavors migration scenarios from the disks for the origin of the s - star cluster .",
    "in turn , this sharp transition supports injection and capture scenarios ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the large central core @xcite of late - type stars is puzzling and currently not understood .",
    "there are a number of possible interpretations , none of which at present offers a compelling explanation : equilibrium mass segregation by itself can not account for this distribution @xcite .",
    "physical collisions with main - sequence stars and stellar black holes can remove moderately bright giants in the central arcsecond , but not over a much larger region , nor to @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "tidal disruption of stars may play a role in the immediate vicinity of the massive black hole @xcite , but most likely can not be an explanation for the lack of an old cusp on the  0.5 pc scale .",
    "the in - spiral of an intermediate mass black hole can plausibly gouge out a large enough core in the stellar distribution @xcite but no direct evidence for such a second black hole was found @xcite .",
    "if the two - body relaxation time scale is significantly longer than the age of the galactic center star cluster ( and the hubble time ) throughout the central parsec @xcite the observed large core may reflect the initial conditions of the galactic center nuclear cluster , but the dynamics of the old star cluster is consistent with a relaxed , fully phase - mixed system @xcite .",
    "in addition , there may be relaxation processes much faster than the standard two - body rate @xcite .",
    "the top - heavy imf discussed here ( if applicable to earlier star formation episodes ) would obviously also lead to a lack of old low mass giants in the core , but the imf probably would have to depend strongly on radius .",
    "the remarkable properties of the galactic center nuclear star cluster remain puzzling and continue to give us food for thought and further work ."
