    "considerable breakthroughs in studies of stellar populations have been enabled over the past 15 years by the development of high - multiplex optical spectrographs , such as aat-2df ( lewis et al .",
    "2002 ) , vlt - flames ( pasquini et al .",
    "2002 ) , and magellan - imacs ( dressler et al . 2011 ) .",
    "these powerful instruments have typically been used to compile large samples of stellar spectra to address questions in stellar evolution ( e.g. , evans et al .",
    "2005 , 2011 ) , or to use stars as tracers of the dynamics and assembly histories of galaxies ( e.g. , zoccali et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "this contribution highlights some of the plans for new multi - object spectrographs ( mos ) in the coming decade , and some of the opportunities they will bring for studies of stellar populations . sections  [ ir ] and [ next ] considers recent developments for 4 - 10 m class observatories , while section  [ elts ] looks foward to future mos observations with the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) , which was recently approved for construction by eso council ( de zeeuw , tamai & liske , 2014 ) .",
    "one of the most exciting developments in the past couple of years has been the arrival of the first near - ir mos instruments on large telescopes : keck - mosfire ( mclean et al . 2012 ) and vlt - kmos ( sharples et al .",
    "2013 ) . although employing different technologies / approaches , i.e. , a configurable cryogenic slit unit cf .  deployable integral field units ( ifus ) ,",
    "both are highly capable instruments for stellar studies , enabling efficient collection of relatively large spectroscopic samples in the near - ir for the first time .",
    "as an example of the new research enabled by access to near - ir mos observations , i highlight recent studies of the physical properties and chemical abundances of red supergiants ( rsgs ) , the cool , luminous descendants of massive stars .",
    "the potential of @xmath0-band spectroscopy of rsgs to determine chemical abundances in galaxies was introduced by davies , kudritzki & figer ( 2010 ) in their analysis of archival spectra from the irtf library ( rayner , cushing & vacca , 2009 ) . the spectral window used in this approach",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ dkf10 ] , and has been further validated by studies of rsgs in the galaxy ( gazak et al .",
    "2014 ) and in the magelllanic clouds ( davies et al . 2015 ) .",
    "a first application of this technique at larger distances was demonstrated by kmos science verification observations of eleven rsgs in ngc6822 ( d@xmath10.46mpc ) , with an estimated mean metallicity , [ @xmath2 , of @xmath30.52@xmath40.21 ( patrick et al .",
    "the final test phase of this technique was kmos guaranteed time observations in ngc300 ( d@xmath51.9mpc ) , enabling a comparison of the rsg abundances ( gazak et al .",
    "2015 , see fig .",
    "[ zke15 ] ) with those for blue supergiants from kudritzki et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . with the method",
    "now tested rigorously in the local universe , efforts are underway to observe a larger sample of galaxies ( spanning a range of masses ) to obtain a direct calibration of the mass - metallicity relation ( see , e.g. , kewley & ellison , 2008 ) .",
    "in addition to observational factors such as sky and telluric subtraction , quantitative stellar work in the near - ir also presents new challenges in the sense that much of the focus on atomic data has traditionally been at optical wavelengths , so new calculations are required to , for instance , account for deviations from the approximation of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( bergemann et al . 2012 ; 2013 ; 2015 ) .",
    "continued efforts will be required in this area if we are to obtain the maximum benefit from future facilities , both from the 8 - 10 m class telescopes and the elts .",
    "beyond the facilities already in operation on ground - based telescopes , there are four mos projects in the design / construction phase that each have ` legacy'-style large surveys of stellar populations as part of their core programmes :    * 4most : optical mos for the 4 m vista telescope ( de jong , this vol . ) ; * moons : ( red-)optical / near - ir mos for the vlt ( cirasuolo , this vol . ) ; * pfs : optical / near - ir mos for the subaru telescope ( takada , this vol . ) ; * weave : optical mos for the wht ( dalton , this vol . ) .",
    "the surveys enabled by this next generation of instruments will provide a truly vast ( @xmath610@xmath7 stars ) census of the stellar populations of the inner milky way , its disk and halo populations , the magellanic clouds , and the dwarf / irregular galaxies of the local group .",
    "other instruments under construction such as gtc - megara ( de paz , this vol . ) and gtc - emir ( garzon , this vol . )",
    "will also contribute valuable observations .",
    "many of the detailed plans for the stellar surveys with these new instruments are presented elsewhere in this volume . as an example of studies of star formation ( specifically whether it always occurs in dense clusters ) , spatial analyses of star - forming regions can already provide us with insights into their initial conditions and dynamical evolution ( e.g. , parker et al .",
    "2014 ; wright et al .",
    "2014 ) , but the information encoded in the radial velocities ( from the spectroscopy ) and proper motions ( from the _ gaia _ mission ) will give us unique three - dimensional information to trace their dynamical histories ( e.g. , to identify comoving groups with the different spatial sub - structures ) .",
    "the mos facilities planned for the coming years will be transformative due to the combination of their large multiplexes with substantial telescope allocations to acquire the vast samples required . however , as we look further ahead , we are ultimately limited by the collecting area of current facilities .",
    "for instance , keck - deimos spectroscopy of the evolved stellar populations in m31 gives insufficient signal - to - noise below the tip of the red giant branch ( at @xmath8@xmath921.5mag , e.g. , chapman et al .",
    "2006 ) , and quantitative analysis of massive o - type stars is limited to all but the most luminous objects beyond 1mpc ( e.g. , tramper et al .",
    "2011 , 2014 ) .",
    "the elts will provide a huge leap forward in both sensitivity and , via adaptive optics ( ao ) , spatial resolution .",
    "in addition to eso s planned 39 m e - elt , there are two other elt projects now entering the construction phase : the giant magellan telescope ( gmt ) and the thirty meter telescope ( tmt ) .",
    "some of the challenges of simply scaling - up current mos designs and capabilities to elt - class instruments are discussed by bernstein ( this vol . ) .",
    "nonetheless , there is a huge range of scientific topics which require elt - mos observations , ranging from spectroscopic characterisation of the most distant galaxies , through to studies of exoplanets in stellar clusters ( evans et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "following phase  a studies of three potential e - elt mos concepts ( see ramsay et al .",
    "2010 ) , european and brazilian astronomers have combined their efforts to assemble a comprehensive science case for an elt - mos ( evans et al .",
    "2015 ) , working together on the mosaic instrument concept ( hammer et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "the range of cases presented by evans et al .",
    "( 2015 ) flow down to instrument requirements which are knowingly broad ( see their table  7 ) .",
    "this step was intended as a first census of all the potential cases and relevant parameter space for mos observations . the phase  a conceptual design of mosaic is anticipated to start in late 2015 , including scientific trade - offs of capability vs.  cost ( and technical feasibility ) .",
    "one of the key approaches in plans for mosaic has been the delineation of possible mos sources into two types of observations , identified by evans et al .",
    "( 2012 ) as :    * _ high definition : _ observations of tens of channels at fine spatial resolution , with multi - object adaptive optics ( moao ) providing high - performance correction for selected sub - fields . *",
    "_ high multiplex : _ integrated - light ( or coarsely - resolved ) observations of @xmath9100 objects at the spatial resolution given by the ground - layer adaptive optics ( glao ) of the telescope .",
    "the technical readiness of the high - definition mode has advanced significantly over the past few years thanks to the canary project on the wht in la palma .",
    "this has performed the first on - sky demonstrations of moao using natural guide stars ( gendron et al . 2011 ; vidal et al . 2014 ) and , more recently , using laser guide stars .",
    "as illustrated by the point - spread functions in fig .",
    "[ vgr14 ] , while moao does not yield the same performance as single - conjugate ao , it is substantially better than that from seeing or glao .",
    "the attraction of this approach is that such performance can potentially be obtained for multiple sub - fields within the large ( @xmath510@xmath10 diameter ) field of the e - elt .    a second moao pathfinder , raven on the subaru telescope",
    ", has also made impressive progress with on - sky tests in the past year ( lardire et al . 2014 ) .",
    "as an aside , note that even in the deep cosmological fields that are deliberately free of bright foreground stars , there are still sufficient ( fainter ) stars for significant improvements in image quality from moao ( basden , evans & morris , 2014 ) .",
    "a key component of the mosaic case , indeed for the elts in general , is concerned with stellar populations , both in the inner milky way and in distant systems beyond 1mpc .",
    "for example , when combined with ao , the @xmath0-band method introduced in section  [ rsgs ] is potentially very powerful , opening - up direct abundance studies of rsgs out to distances of tens of mpc ( evans et al .",
    "work is now underway to explore this technique for lower - mass , evolved stars on the red giant branch , to compare it with the use of the calcium triplet in estimation of stellar metallicities and radial velocities ( e.g. tolstoy et al .",
    "2001 ; battaglia et al . 2008 ) .",
    "an expanded case for this topic was presented by evans et al .",
    "( 2015 ) . in short , mosaic spectroscopy will open - up studies of the evolved populations in galaxies such as the spirals in the sculptor group for the first time .",
    "if employing _ high definition _ ao - corrected observations with ifus , note that the effective multiplex of stars observed in dense regions is likely to be much larger than simply the number of ifus , potentially giving samples of 1000s of stars within a relatively modest amount of time . equally ,",
    "_ high multiplex _ optical spectroscopy would provide high - quality observations of massive o - type stars to investigate their physical properties in galaxies beyond 1mpc and/or studies of the evolved stars in the interesting halo regions of these distant systems .",
    "my thanks to the organisers for their kind invitation to speak at the conference , to ben davies and nick wright for helpful chats ahead of the meeting , and to the staff of la cuatro for a friendly welcome even after the best part of a decade .",
