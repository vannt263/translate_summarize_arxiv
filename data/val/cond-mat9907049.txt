    "are caused by different groups of electrons . whereas the electronic properties like electrical conductivity are borne by itinerant electrons in rather broad bands , e.g. _",
    "5d _ for gd , the magnetism is due to a strongly localized partially filled _ 4f_-shell . in the case of gd and",
    "eu compounds the _ 4f_-shell is exactly half - filled and , because of hund s rules , has its maximal magnetic moment of @xmath0 .",
    "many characteristics of the local - moment systems may be explained by a correlation between the localized magnetic states and the itinerant electrons . in the _ s - f _ model",
    "this correlation is represented by an intra - atomic exchange interaction .",
    "the difference between the _ s - f _ model and the well - known _",
    "kondo lattice model _",
    "@xcite is that in the former the exchange interaction is ferromagnetic , favouring parallel alignment of itinerant electrons and local - moments , whereas in latter it is antiferromagnetic .",
    "that is why the _ s - f _ model has been recently more and more often referred to as the _ ferromagnetic kondo lattice model _ @xcite .",
    "the second aspect of this paper is that of reduced dimensionality .",
    "magnetic phenomena at surfaces and in thin films attract broad attention both theoretically and experimentally due to the question of phase transitions and the variation of magnetic and electronic properties in dimensionally reduced systems @xcite .",
    "one of the most remarkable examples of the outstanding magnetic properties at surfaces is the existence of magnetically ordered surfaces at temperatures where the bulk material is paramagnetic .",
    "this effect has been first documented for gd(0001 ) surfaces by weller _",
    "_ @xcite and since then been measured by different groups using a wide range of experimental techniques @xcite . in these experiments for the difference between the curie temperature at the surface , @xmath1 , and the curie temperature of bulk gd , @xmath2 , values between 17k @xcite and some 60k",
    "@xcite have been reported .",
    "succeeding the results for gd , tb also was found to have a higher surface curie temperature , relative to the bulk @xcite .",
    "contrary to the groups cited above , donath _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , using spin - resolved photoemission did not find any indication for an enhanced surface curie temperature of gd(0001 ) surfaces .",
    "other controversially discussed surface properties of gd include the temperature dependent behaviour of a gd(0001 ) surface state @xcite which is supposed to play an important role in the interplay between electronic structure and magnetism",
    ". a thorough account on the surface magnetism of the lanthanides has been recently given by dowben _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "it is not only the dimensionally reduced gd which is of interest here , even bulk gd is far from being completely understood . in an earlier study nolting _",
    "_ @xcite have predicted that the a priori non - magnetic ( _ 5d_,_6s_)-conduction and valence bands should exhibit a marked non - uniform magnetic response at different positions in the brillouin zone and for different subbands .. weakly correlated ( _ s_-like ) dispersions show a stoner - like @xmath3-dependence of the exchange splitting . on the other hand ,",
    "stronger correlated ( _ d_-like ) dispersions split below @xmath4 into four branches , two for each spin direction .",
    "their @xmath3-dependence mainly concerns the spectral weights of the quasiparticle peaks and not so much the energy positions .",
    "consequently , an exchange caused splitting remains even for @xmath5 .",
    "this may be the reason for the fact that the experimental situation is controversial .",
    "_ @xcite found a @xmath3-dependent spin splitting of occupied conduction electron states , which collapses in a stoner - like fashion for @xmath6 . from photoemission experiments ,",
    "li _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite conclude that the exchange splitting must be wave - vector dependent , collapsing for some @xmath7 values , while for other no collapse occurs as a function of increasing temperature .",
    "this fairly complicated temperature behaviour in the bulk - material must be expected for gd - films , too .",
    "it is not at all a trivial task to perform an electronic structure calculation for a ferromagnetic local - moment film in such a manner as to realistically incorporate correlation effects . in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we proposed a simplified model which allowed us to exactly calculate the electronic structure of a model film in the limiting case of ferromagnetic saturation and empty conduction band , @xmath8 .",
    "this case is applicable to a film of a ferromagnetic semiconductor such as euo , eus at @xmath9 .",
    "its significance arises from the fact that all relevant correlation effects which are found or expected to occur at finite band occupations and arbitrary temperatures @xcite , do already appear in this rigorously tractable special case @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the @xmath9 special case to finite temperatures . as a result",
    "we will calculate the electronic structure of a local - moment film with a single - electron in an otherwise empty conduction band within the whole temperature range from @xmath9 and @xmath10 .    in the next section we present the model and define the corresponding many - body problem .",
    "subsequently the model is evaluated in two steps , in section [ subsec : elsub ] for the electronic subsystem , and in section [ subsec : lms ] for the local - moment system .",
    "section [ sec : results ] is devoted to a detailed discussion of the results obtained for different film thicknesses and various exchange couplings and temperatures .",
    "comprehensive conclusions with an outlook on the possible application of the model to real substances and on the evaluation of temperature dependent surface states in section [ sec : summary ] complete the paper .",
    "we investigate a film consisting of @xmath11 equivalent layers parallel to the surface of the film .",
    "each lattice site of the film is indicated by a greek letter @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 denoting the layer index and a latin letter @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath15 numbering the sites within a given layer .",

    "the quasiparticle bandstructure is therefore identical to the free bloch dispersion , only rigidly shifted by a constant energy amount of @xmath152 , due to the first ising - like term in the _ s - f _ hamiltonian ( [ h_sf ] ) .",

    "the spectral density represents a @xmath155-function located at the point of the free two - dimensional bloch dispersion . for small _ s - f _ exchange coupling , @xmath40 , a slight deformation of the original bloch dispersion sets in and the quasiparticle peaks get a finite width indicating a finite lifetime . for intermediate and strong couplings the spectral density splits into two parts corresponding to two different spin exchange processes between the excited spin-@xmath153 electron and the localized _ f_-spin system .",
    "the higher energetic part of the spectrum represents a polarization of the immediate spin neighbourhood of the electron due to a repeated emission and reabsorption of magnons .",
    "the result is a polaron - like quasiparticle called the _ magnetic polaron_. the low - energetic part of the spectrum is a scattering band which corresponds to the simple emission of a magnon by the spin-@xmath153 electron , which is necessarily connected with a spin - flip of the electron @xcite .",

    "the dotted lines represent the case of vanishing _ s - f _ exchange , @xmath154 , where spin-@xmath153 and spin-@xmath151 spectra are equal .",
    "since the electrons are not coupled to the local - moment system , we also have no temperature dependence . for finite _ s - f _ interaction we see from fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] that in the spin-@xmath153 density of states spectral weight is transferred from the high - energetic polaron peak to the low - energetic scattering peak .",
    "to explain this effect we have to consider the elementary processes which build the spectrum .",
    "the low - energetic scattering peak of the spin-@xmath153 electron consists of two elementary processes .",
    "= 0.87    = 0.8    because of finite deviation of the _ f_-spin system from saturation for @xmath31 , the @xmath153-electron has a finite probability of entering the local frame as spin-@xmath151 electron .",
    "this probability is zero for @xmath158 ( @xmath9 ) and increases with increasing temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "the spin-@xmath153 electron can first emit a magnon and by that process reverse its spin , becoming a spin-@xmath151 electron in the external frame of coordinates .",
    "the spectral weight produced by the first elementary process reduces the spectral weight of the high - energetic polaron peak therefore shifting spectral weight from the high - energetic polaron peaks towards the low - energetic scattering peak .    for the spin-@xmath151 electron we see from fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] that for finite temperatures an additional peak rises at the high - energetic side of the spectra with increasing temperature .",
    "we can explain this effect by the spin-@xmath151 electron absorbing a magnon and subsequently , as spin-@xmath153 electron forming a polaron . here",
    "the magnon absorption by a spin-@xmath151 electron is equivalent to the magnon emission by a spin-@xmath153 electron . in the case of ferromagnetic saturation",
    "the system does not contain any magnons , which is the reason why there is no scattering peak in the spin-@xmath151 spectrum at @xmath9 . as a result of the shifting of spectral weights towards lower energies for the spin-@xmath153 electron and towards higher energies for the spin-@xmath151 electron the densities of states for the two spin directions approach each other with increasing temperature .",
    "= 0.95    in the limiting case of @xmath159 the system has eventually lost its ability to distinct between the two possible spin directions of the test electron because of the loss of magnetization of the underlying local - moment system , @xmath160 .",
    "hence as for the case of vanishing _",
    "interaction for @xmath161 the density of states of states of the spin-@xmath153 electron equals that of the spin-@xmath151 electron .",
    "another feature which can be seen from fig .",

    "another feature which can already be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] is that the increase of temperature results in the narrowing of the subbands . for the case of intermediate coupling ,",
    "@xmath163 , according to figs .",
    "[ fig:6 ] and [ fig:7 ] this band narrowing results in the opening of a gap between the scattering and the polaron band with increasing temperature .",
    "this temperature enhanced band splitting has already been found for the three - dimensional case @xcite .",
    "it can be explained for the spin-@xmath151 electron by the fact that for propagating in its own low - energetic subband it needs to find an appropriate lattice site .",
    "=    in the case of ferromagnetic saturation there is no restriction for the propagation of the spin-@xmath151 electrons since spin - flip processes are impossible . with increasing temperature",
    "there is an increasing deviation of the local moments resulting in the possible magnon absorption by the spin-@xmath151 electron and subsequent changing to the higher energetic polaron subband .",
    "hence , the spin-@xmath151 electron , to propagate in its own subband needs to move further distances with increasing temperature resulting in a reduced effective hopping and in a decreased bandwidth .",
    "=    in addition to the discussed temperature effects , figs .  [ fig:6 ] and [ fig:7 ] exhibit a typical two - peak structure which is caused by the coupling of the two layers .",
    "this two - peak structure is replaced in the case of a film consisting of @xmath11 equivalent layers by an @xmath11-peak structure .",
    "generally , the spectra of the discussed local - moment films are characterised by an interplay between correlation ( @xmath38 ) , temperature effects , and geometry of the film .",
    "[ fig:8 ] and [ fig:9 ] display results for the local density of states and the layer - dependent spectral density of a 20-layer s.c.-(100)-film .",
    "additionally to the dependence on the _ s - f _ exchange interaction and the temperature dependence we notice that the spectral density and the density of states show a typical layer - dependence due to the broken translational symmetry at the surfaces of the film @xcite . for the centre layers ( @xmath148 ) of the 20-layer - film we see from fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] that the local density of states of the spin-@xmath151 electron at @xmath9 has already become pretty similar to the well - known tight - binding density of states of the three - dimensional s.c .",
    "lattice whereas the density of states of the surface layers ( @xmath147 ) exhibits the characteristic semi - elliptic profile .",
    "we have investigated the electronic quasiparticle bandstructure of a ferromagnetic semiconductor film .",
    "a single test electron ( _ s_-band ) is coupled by an intra - atomic _ s - f _ inter - band exchange to a system of localized _ 4f_-moments .",
    "that may be regarded as a proper model description for euo and eus .",
    "our approach uses a moment - conserving decoupling procedure for suitable defined green functions .",
    "the fact that our theory evolves continuously from the exactly solvable limiting case of ferromagnetic saturation @xcite gives it a certain trustworthiness .",
    "the exchange coupling of the conduction electron to the local - moment system gives rise to a correlation induced splitting of the quasiparticle spectra .",
    "a polaron part may be interpreted as a repeated emission and reabsorption of magnons by the conduction electron resulting in a new quasiparticle , the magnetic polaron .",
    "a rather broad scattering peak is due to a simple magnon emission or absorption by the conduction electron .",
    "this pronounced splitting depends on the actual value of the exchange interaction @xmath38 . for small values of @xmath38",
    "only a renormalization of the one - electron energy occurs resulting in a deformation of the free bloch dispersion . for higher values of @xmath38 ,",
    "the mentioned splitting of the spectra into polaron part and scattering part sets in .",
    "we intend to apply the presented model to study the temperature dependent electronic structure of euo and eus films .",
    "therefore the electronic part of the hamiltonian ( [ h_s ] ) and the _ s - f _ exchange interaction ( [ h_sf_orig ] ) have to be modified to include the multiband aspect of real substances",
    ". this will be done by substituting the tight - binding bandstructure ( [ tb_hopp ] ) by a realistic one taken from a bandstructure calculation .",
    "another highly interesting field which we want to use our theory for is the evaluation of the temperature dependence of surface states . in a previous paper",
    "we have calculated surface states for the special case of @xmath9 and @xmath8 by modifying the hopping in the vicinity of the surface @xcite .",
