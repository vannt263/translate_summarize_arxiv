    "cost estimation is a major issue for operators , especially when their commercial expansion leads them to deploy networks on new territories often using new technologies .",
    "today s world of mobility generates an amount of challenging problems but does not eliminate the need to consider fixed connections that either constitute whole networks or are part of the infrastructure of mobile ones .",
    "high speed optical connections are nowadays required wherever possible in order to satisfy customers .",
    "the problem for an operator lies in the words `` wherever possible '' that describe the technical feasibility as well as the financial impact of potential solutions ; obviously the last one should be minimal .",
    "we consider here the design from scratch of a fixed network deployment at urban scale under cost and efficiency constraints .",
    "the description of a realistic telecommunication network deployment involves a huge number of parameters not all equally well documented , spanning fields from geography , regional development , sociology , technology , etc  one does not a priori know which of them will play a crucial role for a given analysis such as cost estimation in our case .",
    "for example , the physical links of fixed networks ( optical fibres or copper wires ) are located along the streets and therefore one can assume that it is compulsory to include the underlying road system in the formulation of the problem .",
    "but what is its real impact on the sought result ? and",
    "what precise characteristics of the street system is it important to consider ?",
    "exhaustive reconstructions of deployment solutions can not answer this for computational reasons ( precise input data are often missing and computing time to find optimal solutions is prohibitive ) and due to the difficulty to extract the impact of each parameter from a set of solutions .",
    "once the architecture and deployment rules are known , optimization methods @xcite compute optimal locations for nodes and optimal ways for paths in order to minimize the cost of a network given the area of deployment .",
    "however , for planning purposes on a territory , other methods must be used to determine globally what would be the potentially best architectures and technical choices prior to the above mentioned detailed spatial localization of equipment .",
    "one class of such methods uses graph theory and complex networks theory to compute an estimation of the number of nodes and of the trenching length needed for a given urban area and a simple architecture @xcite .",
    "another class of such methods are macroscopic models based on * _ stochastic geometry_*. stochastic geometry @xcite is the mathematical field of spatial probability and has a wide range of applications @xcite . in particular",
    ", it allows an instantaneous analysis of modern telecommunication networks , which performances strongly depend on the spatial arrangement of their components , while focusing on global results rather than a detailed description of the network .",
    "this approach makes it possible to take into account and to understand the statistical complexity of the system by extracting its structuring parameters and explicitly showing how they impact the statistics of geometry dependent quantities . here",
    ", one is not interested in the precise location of network equipment , but on statistics on quantities that are meaningful for the operator such as distances from customers to equipment , or costs , that can decide on the economic interest and/or technical feasibility of a network design on a particular area .",
    "the idea of macroscopic models for fixed network is to replace actual locations of objects by random processes that take into account the main principles of their positioning while introducing a variability that represents the effect of numerous and unavoidable local constraints that compel in reality to slightly modify the planned locations .",
    "random processes deal with geometrical objects of any shapes .",
    "their definition explicitly describes some rules and associated parameters to randomly generate realizations of sets of these objects .",
    "so called `` functionals '' ( for example the distances between pairs of points ) can then be computed on each realization of the set .",
    "the aim of stochastic geometry is to derive closed form expressions for the output of the functional , depending on the type and parameters of the processes . in this way",
    ", statistics on the geometrical properties of sets of objects can be obtained instantaneously and independently of their number of elements .",
    "this paper focuses on cost estimation of network at urban scale using the techniques of stochastic geometry .",
    "it is organized as follows : section [ sec : methods ] recalls the context of existing models developed in orange labs and explains the underlying mathematical objects involved ; section [ sec : implementation ] describes how those objects are organized and integrated in a user - friendly tool to build a faithful macroscopic model of the implementation of a realistic network and its costs ; section [ sec : results ] provides and discusses results on real cities and section [ sec : conclusion ] opens some perspectives .",
    "in @xcite a simple cost function for a hierarchical core network which nodes are located in the plane is considered and optimized to deduce the characteristics of the middle layer . to address access networks that describe connections to the customers",
    ", the location of networks equipment must be estimated considering the existing road system since the network nodes are located on or close to the streets . to take advantage of the power of stochastic modelling , all the parts of the model including the street system have to be randomized .",
    "subsections below briefly present the work done in the past years concerning the randomization , respectively of the street system , the typical cell , the links and the capacity trees .",
    "discussions and details can be found in the references .",
    "we call * _ node _ * a geographical site containing various pieces of equipment , designed to perform specific functions in the network . nodes of similar functions are referred to by their type such as pb ( branching point ) or pm ( shared access point )",
    ". this section will be devoted to the model of the elementary two levels network .",
    "its architecture is the simplest one , involving low level nodes ( ll ) , high level nodes ( hl ) and their formal * _ link _ * ( l ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2net ] ) .",
    "ll and hl must be of different types .",
    "engineering rules ensure that any node ll is connected to a unique node hl and specify how the nodes and the physical path of the link are spatially located .",
    "a * _ 2net _ * is the formal representation of a number of hl nodes and their links l deployed on the territory to be served .",
    "note that the characteristics of the links ( number , length ... ) depend on both hl and ll , but their description does not include any node characteristics .",
    "we shall explain below how a 2net can be modelled by a unique spatial random object , the * _ typical cell _ * and its content .",
    "any hierarchical architecture can be represented as an assembly of 2nets . for example a three levels purely hierarchical architecture from ll to hl is built form ( hl , ll_2 , l_2 ) and ( hl_1 , ll , l_1 ) by identification of ll_2 and hl_1 . the generic aspect of the 2net notion allows us to conduct generic computations on all network characteristics whatever the architecture ( see section [ subsec : network_design ] ) .",
    "the morphology of an urban street system reflects the history of the city . ignoring dead - ends ,",
    "the streets segments of a planar map constitute the edges of a planar tessellation .",
    "the cells of the tessellation are generally not uniform : their area , number of edges , etc  can vary from one cell to the other . to cope with this spatial variability , and ignoring the finite area of the map",
    ", it is viewed as a realization of a random stationary tessellation @xmath0 that is fully determined by three independent scalar geometrical quantities averaged per unit area @xcite .",
    "we chose to represent the morphology of the map by the four - vector @xmath1 composed of quantities than can be easily estimated : the mean number of crossings , of edges , of cells and the mean length of streets .",
    "the mean number of edges is included for checking purpose and should equal the mean number of crossings plus cells .",
    "simple homogeneous random models as poisson vorono , poisson line and poisson delaunay tessellation ( pvt , plt and pdt ) are good candidates to capture the morphology of a street system .",
    "each one is fully described by a unique scalar intensity parameter @xmath2 .",
    "their corresponding theoretical vector @xmath3 can be expressed as a function of @xmath2 , for example : @xmath4then , a * _ fitting procedure _ * @xcite applied to the city map selects the best random model chosen in a set of available models and estimates its parameter by minimizing a distance between @xmath1 and @xmath5 .",
    "realizations of the selected model look quite different from the real data , but averaged quantities are close .",
    "for example : 1855 crossings , 2937 edges , 1083 cells and 439 km streets measured in an area 53.9 km@xmath6 of the french city of pau , correspond to a pvt , @xmath2=18.2 km@xmath7 and theoretical averages : 1961 crossings , 2941 edges , 980 cells and 460 km streets . to cope with the frequent non stationarity of cities , a * _ segmentation _ * procedure @xcite automatically partitions the city in as many homogeneous parts as desired and fits the best model for each part .",
    "simple poisson models are sufficient for our final purpose , but better fits can be obtained considering iterated @xcite , stit @xcite or poisson gabriel @xcite tessellations .      the above defined 2net will be deployed in an area covered by a street system fitted by a random process . in order to anchor this 2net to the territory , one has to specify ( i ) how to locate the nodes with respect to the streets and ( ii ) how to associate a unique hl to any ll , thus defining the hl serving zone with respect to lls ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2net ] ) .",
    "the process for nodes is doubly stochastic ( poisson - cox process ) since they are assumed to be randomly positioned following a linear poisson process on the random process for streets .",
    "processes for hls and lls are assumed independent and are described by intensity parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 under homogeneity assumption ( see appendix ) .",
    "any ll located in the geographical area called the serving zone of the hl will be connected to it .",
    "the serving zone of a hl is modelled as its vorono cell ( set of points of the plane closest to this hl than to any other ) constructed with the euclidean metric .",
    "any ll is thus almost surely connected to a single hl .",
    "note that the set of all serving zones is a poisson - cox - vorono - tessellation ( pcvt ) of the plane , different from a pvt since the location of hls is restricted to the streets .",
    "we define the * _ typical cell _ * as the random object which characteristics obey the statistics of the cells of pcvt .",
    "fast algorithms for simulation of these cells are described in @xcite .",
    "they are based on realizations of the street system supporting the hl and stopping criteria from neighbouring hls locations .",
    "links and capacity trees discussed below are mathematically defined relatively to those typical cells .",
    "more complicated models using non euclidean metric for the typical cells and gibbs models for the location of nodes , could be thought more realistic .",
    "but the simpler assumptions above proved to be quite effective and sufficient for our macroscopic approach .",
    "the links between a hl and all the lls included in its serving zone are assumed to follow the shortest paths along the streets .",
    "their number as well as their lengths @xmath10 are random . explicit formulas relating the average @xmath11 to the parameters of the streets and nodes random models were proposed in @xcite .",
    "this is not enough for practical purpose on topics such as eligibility ( % of customers closer than a given length threshold to the highest node , ensuring a good quality for communication ) that require to know the probability distribution of the length @xmath12 .",
    "closed parametric forms @xmath13 for the probability distribution of @xmath10 ( see appendix ) are derived in @xcite .",
    "the distribution does not depend on @xmath9 and may be understood as the distribution of lengths viewed from a typical ll , or as the distribution of all the lengths of links l in the network .",
    "the formulas include limit values and are valid in the whole range @xmath14 of parameters",
    ". they can be plugged in a software , avoiding lengthy simulations , and adapt to all possible cases .",
    "this abstract construction has been successfully tested in @xcite by comparing simulation results to histograms for lengths of links obtained from real networks .",
    "the parametric formulas @xmath15 provide a quantitative and explicit appreciation of the structuring features of our problem that are the morphology of the street system ( represented by the random model ) and the nature of the physical path of the link ( in straight line or along the streets ) .",
    "however costs can not be directly inferred from the distance distributions and one has to consider the multipoint to point tree rooted in hl to all the lls of its serving zone .",
    "this tree has a meaning only if the physical paths of the links follow an underlying street system ; then more than one link can share a common street segment . in optical networks ,",
    "optical fibres are bundled in cables .",
    "the cabling policy selects which size of cable(s ) will accommodate the * _ capacity _ * of each street segment , i.e. the number of fibres running along it .",
    "since the cost of cables depends on their size ( for example a 12-fibre cable is quite cheaper than two 6-fibre ones ) it is a major issue to study * _ capacity trees _ * rooted in hls . cabling itself",
    "is considered as network engineering and will be addressed in section [ subsec : cable ] . in the framework of stochastic modelling , random capacity trees on street systems are extremely difficult to handle .",
    "tentative definitions for structuring characteristics , such as typical sub trees , were investigated in @xcite together with estimators for the distribution function of their length . since an hl",
    "is located almost surely on a street segment and not on a crossing , a capacity tree is composed of two half trees that are statistically dependent because they are constrained to live in the same cell . a parametric copula description for their lengths as well as asymptotic results for infinitely sparse or dense networks is studied in @xcite .",
    "sparse random trees with a fixed number of two lls are fully explored in @xcite .",
    "since we do not have for now generic parametric formulas for the joint probability distributions of the various elements that will enter our cost function ( number of cables merging , number of kilometres of cables for each cable capacity ) , we have to simulate the capacity trees .",
    "the input parameters are @xmath16 , @xmath9 and the capacity @xmath17 incoming from each ll , assuming that all lls bring in a common deterministic capacity .",
    "future work could introduce some variability in this capacity .",
    "a capacity tree is obtained from a realization of the typical cell and of the lls ( fig .",
    "[ fig : typicaltree ] ) .",
    "the root of the tree is the hl .",
    "the final leaves are either an edge of the cell or a `` midpoint '' at which two different paths of equal length to the root hl exist .",
    "note that a path to the hl may need to borrow streets outside the cell .",
    "a street element of constant capacity defines a `` section '' of the tree .",
    "starting from a final leaf , the capacity changes ( i ) by adding @xmath17 each time we pass a ll ( ii ) by adding the capacities of incoming branches at a street crossing .",
    "the vertices of the tree are the street crossings .",
    "the set of sections of non zero capacity is the portion of the road system covered by the network .",
    "the sections are indexed and each realization of the tree is stored in a text file containing information on vertices ( planar location , index of parent vertex ) , contour of the typical cell , distance of lls to hl , etc  this allows a full reconstruction of the tree and offers the possibility of statistical analysis of all possible single or joined characteristics . for our purpose , only the length of covered streets and the joint distribution ( capacity , length of sections ) will be used .",
    "the limit cases mentioned above are not yet included in the tool that restricts the simulation to a given range of parameters , avoiding cases of too dense or too sparse networks .",
    "the sections above introduce typical random objects related to the description of an elementary two levels network .",
    "to model the deployment of this network in a realistic setting , one has to precise the geographical area @xmath18 to be covered ( whole city or part of it ) and the expected number @xmath19 of serving zones ( or equivalently of hl nodes ) to consider .",
    "added to the model for roads , this characterizes the parameters for the typical cell of averaged area @xmath20 and the intensity @xmath8 ( see appendix ) . in real networks ,",
    "the serving zones in @xmath18 are not identical and present a variability that is assumed to be correctly represented by the statistics of this typical cell .",
    "rigorously , the covering of @xmath18 by typical cells should include some constraints on the sum of their areas and border effects should also be considered . for the sought applications ,",
    "these corrections can be neglected and the very simple approach of combining the characteristics of @xmath19 typical cells of identical parameters is sufficient .    to summarize , realistic access networks have their lowest level directly connected to the customers .",
    "they can be built by combining elementary 2nets simply assuming for each of them that the serving zones are vorono areas in which the physical links follow shortest paths on the streets or in the plane .",
    "the above mentioned results mainly concern technical and geometrical aspects of the network ( nodes , links and capacity trees ) .    the theoretical framework being complete , in order to achieve our goal to build an user - friendly tool for cost estimation , one still has to :    * enable the user to select a deployment territory , to design an architecture and to specify engineering rules , * specify how demography and road data should be selected and processed to be proposed as input for the tool , * enable the user to enter precise formulas allowing to compute the costs , * compare the results to data obtained in an operational context and explain the observed discrepancies .",
    "two tools were developed with the aim to allow a user to benchmark different architectures and several engineering parameters for each architecture , in order to compare them and to determine the optimal ( with respect to costs and eligibility ) architecture and engineering rules to deploy in a given city .",
    "the * _ osmminer _ * prototype ( fig .",
    "[ fig : osmminer ] ) is used first to acquire the territory data , choose the best model to fit them and compute the parameters of the model ( section [ subsec : territory ] ) .",
    "then , proceeding with the * _ ntstool _ * prototype , the user selects a territory and designs or selects an architecture ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ntstool ] ) ; the tool then implements the methodology described above to compute the distance and attenuation distributions and to estimate the deployment costs .",
    "ntstool is designed to be generic for urban areas and can potentially address a variety of situations .",
    "sections [ subsec : network_design ] to [ subsec : costs ] below focus on optical access networks .",
    "the road system of the territory is extracted from the open street map ( osm ) database @xcite since it has a worldwide coverage with a very detailed description of the various types of roads .",
    "its rich typology allows to select the types of streets that will support the network wires while suppressing the useless or duplicated ones ( eg . cycle ways or paths ) .",
    "moreover , osm comes with several free applications and is free of charge .",
    "osm also provides information about buildings , but they are not always complete nor accurate .",
    "the administrative boundary of a given municipality generally differs from the `` build - up '' area limit inside which the streets are more or less continuously lined with buildings .",
    "the `` build - up '' area sometimes includes part of the neighbouring municipalities and contains most of the population of the city .",
    "it is thus the area of interest from the point of view of network deployment .",
    "a java code has been developed to automatically determine this limit using information on buildings .",
    "since there are regions where no information on the buildings is available , the limit can also be deduced from the road system information only .",
    "the method is to sum up the number of buildings or streets in each square of a regular grid of adjustable size and to first eliminate the squares with a sum less than a threshold given by the user , and second the isolated squares ( those with no more than one neighbour ) .",
    "a concave hull of the set of remaining squares is determined using @xcite and an algorithm directly inspired by @xcite .",
    "the limit ( fig .",
    "[ fig : osmminer ] ) is given in the form of a standard osm `` .poly '' file which can then be tailored if necessary by free tools like josm @xcite .    finally , to recover a planar graph for the town , i.e. the streets inside the build - up area ,",
    "the longitude - latitude coordinates given by osm are projected on the tangent plane at the center of the territory ( which is small enough to neglect distortions ) . following the methodology described in section [ subsec : street ] ,",
    "dead - ends are removed in order to get a tessellation @xcite , the town is segmented in as many parts as desired , and the best model for each part is determined with its intensity parameter ( for now , one can chose among three tessellation models : pvt , pdt and plt ) .",
    "the results are stored in a `` * * _ voirie _ * * '' file constituted by as many lines as there are parts of the town , plus one line representing the town as a whole ( table [ tab : voirie ] ) .",
    ".example of a `` voirie '' file for the french city of nantes .",
    "part1 is the dense core of the city . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the theoretical results developed in previous works were implemented in two user - friendly prototypes for cost estimation of fixed access network deployment on any urban area with very short computing time .",
    "the idea is to let the user try several architectures and scenarios in order to compare them and determine the best one according to its criteria . on a specific use case ( deploying optical fibre ) the costs obtained are very close to those computed by an orange optimization tool based on an entirely different approach .",
    "the nts methodology based on statistical modelling proved to be quite efficient even on the small areas considered in the comparison .",
    "the tools are modular and will be enriched by non - isotropic models for streets ( manhattan ) and extended to rural areas .",
    "the range of applications of osmminer / ntstool prototypes is quite large since they make it possible to consider any architecture and scenario on any urban or rural area .",
    "we are currently considering using their results on the fibre networks linking mobile base stations to antennas , as well as on electrical networks .",
    "another possible application is to evaluate the distance to drive in order to maintain all the mobile sites in a country , depending on the number of maintenance centres : this could allow us to better challenge the costs declared by the sub - contractors .",
    "a two levels network with a number @xmath21 of high nodes hl and @xmath22 of low nodes ll is to be deployed on a territory @xmath23 of area @xmath18 ( km@xmath6 ) .",
    "let us assume that the fitting process identified a pvt model of intensity @xmath2 ( km@xmath7 ) for the streets and recall that the corresponding morphological vector is @xmath24 where @xmath25 ( km@xmath26 ) is the average length of streets par unit area .",
    "the averaged area of a hl serving zone is then @xmath27 since everything is assumed homogeneous .",
    "it contains a mean length of streets @xmath28 ( km ) and is assimilated to the area of the typical `` poisson - cox - vorono '' cell centred on hl .",
    "this typical cell also contains by construction a unique hl thus giving @xmath29 ( km@xmath26 ) for the linear intensity of the random process that models hl locations on the streets .",
