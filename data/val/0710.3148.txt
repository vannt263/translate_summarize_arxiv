    "it is well known that many long - standing problems of the big bang model , namely the horizon problem , flatness , homogeneity and the numerical density of monopoles , may find a natural explanation in the frame of the inflationary universe model @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most relevant feature of the inflationary universe model is that it provides a causal interpretation for the origin of the observed anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , and also the distribution of large - scale structures @xcite .",
    "but the inflationary universe model has problems too .",
    "one of the problems in it is how to attach the observed universe to the end of the inflationary epoch ; there are three possible solutions to this problem : reheating @xcite , preheating @xcite and warm inflation @xcite . in this work we focus on the latter .    in standard inflationary universe models ,",
    "the acceleration of the universe is driven by a scalar field ( named inflaton ) with a specific scalar potential .",
    "these kinds of model are divided into two regimes , the slow - roll and reheating ephocs . in the slow - roll period",
    "the universe inflates and all interactions between the inflaton scalar field and any other field are typically neglected .",
    "subsequently , a reheating period is invoked to end the period of inflation . after reheating",
    ", the universe is filled with radiation @xcite , and then the universe gets connected with the big bang model .",
    "warm inflation is an alternative mechanism to have successful inflation and avoid the reheating period @xcite . in this kind of model ,",
    "dissipative effects are important during inflation , so that radiation production occurs concurrently with the inflationary expansion .",
    "the inflaton interacts with a thermal bath via a friction term , where phenomenologically the decay of the scalar field is described by means of an interaction lagrangian .",
    "for instance , the authors of ref.@xcite take the interaction terms of the form @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where the inflationary period presents a two - stage decay chain @xmath3 . in this case , they reported that the damping term @xmath4 becomes @xmath5 .",
    "note that if the scalar field changes a little bit , then the friction coefficient @xmath4 remains almost constant . from the point of view of statistical mechanics",
    ", the interaction between quantum fields and a thermal bath could be illustrated by a general fluctuation - dissipation relation @xcite .",
    "warm inflation was criticized on the basis that the inflaton can not decay during the slow - roll phase @xcite . however , in recent years , it has been shown that the inflaton can indeed decay during the slow - roll phase ( see @xcite and references therein ) whereby it now rests on solid theoretical grounds .",
    "on the other hand , the inclusion of the damping term into the model needs a very special scheme : for instance , in ref.@xcite it was found that when @xmath4 is constant , in the slow - roll approximation a wrong value for the number of e - fold was obtained : meanwhile , in the power - law approach this problem is absent .",
    "warm inflation ends when the universe heats up to become radiation dominated . at this epoch",
    "the universe stops inflating and ` smoothly ' enters into a radiation dominated big bang phase @xcite .",
    "the matter components of the universe are created by the decay of either the remaining inflationary field or the dominant radiation field @xcite .    in standard inflationary universe models",
    "the quantum fluctuations associated to the inflaton scalar field generate the density perturbations seeding the structure formation at a late time in the evolution of the universe . instead ,",
    "in warm inflation models , the density fluctuations arise from thermal rather than quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations have their origin in the hot radiation and influence the inflaton through a friction term in the equation of motion of the inflaton scalar field @xcite .",
    "several aspects of warm inflationary universe models have been studied in the past few years .",
    "the goal of the present work is to investigate warm inflationary models on brane scenarios , where the total energy density @xmath6 is found on the brane @xcite .",
    "the universe is filled with a self - interacting scalar field of energy density @xmath7 and a radiation field with energy density @xmath8 .",
    "the motivation for introducing brane scenarios is the increasing interest in higher dimensional cosmological models , motivated by superstring theory , where the matter fields ( related to open string modes ) are confined to a lower dimensional brane , while gravity ( closed string modes ) can propagate in the bulk @xcite .",
    "shiromizu et al .",
    "@xcite have found the four - dimensional einstein s equations projected onto the brane .",
    "these projections introduce some differences in the fundamental field equations , such as the friedmann equation and , therefore , in the equations that describes the linear perturbations theory @xcite .",
    "our aim is quantify the modifications of the warm inflation model in the brane scenario for arbitrary inflaton potentials on the brane . in order to do this we study the linear theory of cosmological perturbations for a warm inflationary model on a brane .",
    "the perturbations are expressed in term of different parameters appearing in our model : these parameters will be constrained from the wmap three - year data @xcite .    in section",
    "ii we describe the dynamics of our model and we establish some approximations that we use in this work . in section",
    "iii we investigate the linear theory of perturbations .",
    "here we calculate the scalar perturbations in the longitudinal gauge and also the tensor perturbations . in section iv we take a power - law potential and we investigate the high - energy and high - dissipation regime considering a power - law dissipation coefficient @xmath4 . finally , in section v",
    ", we give some conclusions .",
    "we have used units in which @xmath9 .",
    "if einstein s equations hold in five dimensions , with a cosmological constant term as source , and the matter fields are confined to the 3-brane , then shiromizu et al . @xcite",
    "have shown that the projected einstein s equations onto the brane are given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the energy - momentum tensor on the brane , @xmath12 is a tensor quadratic in @xmath11 , @xmath13 is a projection of the five - dimensionl weyl tensor describing the effect of bulk graviton degrees of freedom on brane dynamics and @xmath14 is the planck scale in @xmath15 dimensions .",
    "the effective cosmological constant @xmath16 on the brane is determined by the five - dimensional cosmological constant @xmath17 and the 3-brane tension @xmath18 , @xmath19 and the four - dimensional planck scale is given by @xmath20    in a cosmological scenario in which the metric projected onto the brane is a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric , with scale factor @xmath21 , the friedmann equation on the brane has the form @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an integration constant arising from @xmath13 , and thus transmitting bulk graviton influence onto the brane , and @xmath24 is the total energy density on the brane . during inflation , the last term in the eq.([eq4 ] ) will be rapidly diluted , then , we can neglect it .",
    "we will also assume that @xmath16 is negligible , at least in the early universe .",
    "with these assumptions , we can rewrite eq.([eq4 ] ) as @xmath25 we note that in the limit @xmath26 ( low - energy limit ) we recover the standard four - dimensional result . the quadratic modification to the friedmann equation will be dominant at high energies and moderated @xmath18 ( the limit @xmath27 is named high - energy limit ) , but it must be sub - dominant before nucleosynthesis . since it decays as @xmath28 during the radiation era , it will rapidly become negligible thereafter .",
    "the nucleosynthesis limit implies that @xmath29 @xcite and by eq.([eq3 ] ) this gives @xmath30 where we know that @xmath31 is the four dimensional effective planck scale .",
    "a more stringent constraint may be found if the fifth dimension is infinite .",
    "in fact , by requiring that relative corrections to the newtonian law of gravity , which are of order @xmath32 @xcite , be small on scales @xmath33 and using eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) we have @xmath34 .",
    "we consider a standard scalar field in a spatially flat frw cosmological model in a warm inflationary scenario on a brane .",
    "the dynamics of this model is described by the following set of equations : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the hubble factor , @xmath8 is the energy density of the radiation field and @xmath4 is the dissipation coefficient , with unit @xmath37 .",
    "the dissipative coefficient is responsible for the decay of the scalar field into radiation during the inflationary regime .",
    "@xmath4 can be assumed to be a constant or a function of the scalar field @xmath0 or the temperature @xmath38 or both @xcite . here",
    ", we will take @xmath4 to be a function of @xmath0 only . in the near future",
    "we hope to study more realistic models in which @xmath4 not only depends on @xmath0 but also on @xmath38 , an expression which could be derived from first principles via quantum field theory approach @xcite . on the other hand , @xmath4 must satisfy @xmath39 by the second law of thermodynamics . from now on dots and primes mean derivatives with respect to the cosmological time @xmath40 and the scalar field @xmath0 , respectively . for a standard inflationary model ( four - dimensional general relativity )",
    "the condition for inflation is @xmath41 , which is equivalent to having @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this guarantees that there is acceleration , i.e. @xmath45 .    the modified friedmann equation lead to a stronger condition for inflation , namely @xmath46 where we have used eqs.([eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "we can see that in the limit @xmath26 we recover the standard condition for inflation , but in the limit @xmath27 we find a new condition , @xmath47 . in the following",
    "we shall assume that the condition expressed by eq.([eq10 ] ) is satisfied . during the slow - roll approximation",
    ", we assume that the energy density is dominated by the self - interacting energy density related to the scalar field , that is @xmath48 , and therefore , the scalar field evolution is strongly damped @xcite : @xmath49 where @xmath50 means equality within the slow - roll approximation . furthermore",
    ", as usual , we will assume a quasi - stable radiation production during the warm inflation phase @xcite .",
    "thus , from eq.([eq9 ] ) we obtain @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the temperature of the thermal bath and the last equality means that the stefan - boltzmann law is valid in our model",
    ". it will be useful to introduce the adimensional parameter @xmath53 that parametrizes the dissipation for our model : @xmath54 for the high ( or weak ) dissipation regime we have @xmath55 ( or @xmath56 ) .",
    "we define the slow - roll parameters as @xmath57 we see that in the limit of low energy and weak dissipation ( i.e. @xmath58 and @xmath56 ) we recover the usual slow - roll parameters for the standard inflationary universe model .    using eqs.([eq11 ] ) to ( [ eq14 ] ) we can write the energy density of the radiation field as a function of the scalar field potential in the form of @xmath59 which , by using the definition of @xmath60 , becomes @xmath61 which may be written as @xmath62 where we have taken @xmath63 .",
    "it is well known that inflation occurs when the condition @xmath64 ( or equivalently @xmath45 ) is fulfilled .",
    "thus , from the latter expression we get @xmath65 therefore , we could have a warm inflationary period on the brane when this latter inequality is satisfied . on the other hand ,",
    "inflation ends when the universe heats up , at the time in which @xmath66 , which implies @xmath67    finally , in the following , we would like to refer to the number of e - foldings . for our model",
    "the number of e - foldings at the end of inflation is given by @xmath68 we see that in the limit of high - energy and high - dissipation ( @xmath69 and @xmath55 ) the rate of expansion is increased respect to a standard inflationary model , while in the limit low energy and weak dissipation ( @xmath58 and @xmath56 ) the rate of expansion is the same than that of the standard inflationary model . from now on ,",
    "the subscripts @xmath70 and @xmath71 are used to denote the beginning and the end of inflationary period , respectively .",
    "in this section we will describe scalar and tensor perturbations , where the former will be determined by using the longitudinal gauge , for a warm inflationary universe model on a brane .      by using the longitudinal gauge in the perturbed frw metric",
    ", we write @xmath72 where @xmath73**x**@xmath74 and @xmath75**x**@xmath74 are the bardeen s gauge - invariant variables @xcite .",

    "eq.([eq24 ] ) coincides with that described in ref.@xcite , while eqs.([eq25 ] ) , ( [ eq26 ] ) and ( [ eq27 ] ) are standard equations in the linear theory of cosmological perturbations for warm inflationary models @xcite .",
    "we should note that in the case of scalar perturbations the scalar and the radiation fields are interacting .",
    "therefore , we expect isocurvature ( or entropy ) perturbations to be generated , apart from of the adiabatic ones . this occurs because warm inflation can be considered as an inflationary model where two fields interact , see refs.@xcite .",
    "on large scales , i.e. , @xmath82 , we need to describe the non - decreasing adiabatic and isocurvature modes . furthermore",

    "for example , in the slow - roll approximation , in the case @xmath196 and , when we try to consider a variable coefficient of dissipation @xmath4 , we did not find any real solution .",
    "however , we think that we could find a solution if in place of using this approximation we assume a power - law for the scale factor .",
