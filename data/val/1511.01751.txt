    "physical systems with pt - symmetry and its breaking are studied recently in very many papers , see e.g. the review _ making sense of non - hermitian hamiltonians _ @xcite . using the equivalence between the one - particle schrdinger equation and the optical wave equation @xcite , it was possible to prove the theoretical results in optical devices @xcite .",
    "further studies provided interesting applications in different pt - symmetric systems .",
    "this caused some new trends in recent pt - symmetry studies : _ although pt - symmetric systems were originally explored at a highly mathematical level , it is now understood that one can interpret pt - symmetric systems simply as nonisolated physical systems having a balanced loss and gain _ @xcite .    in literature ,",
    "open quantum systems are described usually by means of a non - hermitian hamiltonian , e.g. @xcite and also @xcite . in these papers ,",
    "pt - symmetry does not play a special role .",
    "nevertheless , physical processes similar to pt - symmetry breaking are observed experimentally .",
    "they are called mostly dynamical phase transitions @xcite , sometimes also superradiance @xcite .",
    "most convincing experimental results are obtained in studies on mesoscopic systems , see the review @xcite .    in calculations for concrete systems ,",
    "the non - hermiticity of the hamilton operator is introduced mostly by adding a non - hermitian perturbation term to the hermitian hamiltonian that describes the main features of the system , e.g. @xcite .",
    "due to dynamical phase transitions appearing in open quantum systems , the definition of this hermitian hamiltonian is however not unique .",
    "for example , it is basically a shell - model hamiltonian when light nuclei are considered @xcite while it is a completely other hamiltonian in heavy nuclei @xcite . in the last case ,",
    "the individual states are described usually by statistical assumptions ( mostly according to random matrix theory ) .",
    "generally , open quantum systems consist of some localized microscopic region that is embedded into an infinitely large environment of scattering wavefunctions . due to this embedding",
    ", the states of the localized region can decay into the environment giving them a finite lifetime .",
    "the environment can be changed , it can however never be deleted .",
    "this can be seen immediately from the finite lifetime of , e.g. , nuclear states which is determined exclusively ( without participation of any external observer ) by the wavefunctions of the individual states and their coupling to the environment .",
    "the lifetime of the nuclear states can be used therefore for radioactive geologic age determination .    according to this statement ,",
    "the whole function space of the open quantum system consists of two parts : one part is the function space of discrete states of the localized part while the other part is the function space of continuous scattering wavefunctions .",
    "a very successful method used to describe the properties of an open quantum system , is therefore a formalism with two projection operators each of which is related to one of the two parts of the function space .",
    "this method developed in nuclear physics many years ago @xcite , has been applied also to the description of other systems , see e.g. the review @xcite .",
    "the hamilton operator of the whole system is hermitian while those two hamiltonians that describe the properties of either subsystem , are non - hermitian .",
    "the question arises what is the relation between pt - symmetry breaking and a dynamical phase transition appearing in an open quantum system . in both cases ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is non - hermitian . in the first case , the eigenvalues are real and become complex under critical conditions . in the second case ,",
    "critical conditions arise at and near to mathematical singularities which cause essential changes in the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian .",
    "these changes may occur because the eigenfunctions are biorthogonal and the states of the system may talk via the environment .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to study differences and similarities between the physical results obtained for non - hermitian quantum systems under critical conditions and that , on the one hand , in the case of pt - symmetry breaking and , on the other hand , in the case of dynamical phase transitions .",
    "in contrast to most other models for the description of open quantum systems , we do not start from a specific hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "instead , we consider a hamiltonian that is completely non - hermitian from the very beginning ; determine its eigenvalues and eigenfunctions ; investigate nonlinear effects ( that cause irreversibility ) ; and trace dynamical phase transitions .",
    "the formalism is described in @xcite . in the present paper , we are interested , above all , in the fact that the states of an open quantum system can talk to one another via the environment into which the system is embedded . by this ,",
    "the wavefunctions become mixed and their phases cease to be rigid .",
    "this is a new feature characteristic of any open quantum system .",
    "it is incompatible with the basic assumptions of hermitian quantum physics .    in section [ ham ] , we provide expressions for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a non - hermitian @xmath0 operator @xmath1 and point shortly to their specific features by which they differ from the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a hermitian operator .",
    "the eigenfunctions of a non - hermitian operator are biorthogonal .",
    "most important are the singular points , called usually _ exceptional points ( eps ) _ , at which the biorthogonality of the eigenfunctions plays an important role . in the following section [ eig ] ,",
    "we consider the eigenfunctions of @xmath1 in the very neighborhood of eps . above all",
    ", we consider the phase rigidity of the eigenfunctions which is a quantitative measure of the difference between orthogonal and biorthogonal eigenfunctions . under the influence of eps ,",
    "it is reduced and vanishes at an ep . here",
    ", the eigenfunctions are mixed in the set of basic wavefunctions .",
    "some numerical results for the phase rigidity and for the mixing of the wavefunctions are shown and discussed in section [ num ] for natural systems the states of which can decay , as well as for systems with loss and gain .",
    "most astonishing and unexpected result is that the eigenfunctions are almost orthogonal at the critical point of maximum width bifurcation or maximum level repulsion .",
    "we discuss these results in section [ disc ] . in the following section [ trap ] ,",
    "their relation to the phenomenon of resonance trapping is considered .",
    "some concluding remarks can be found in section [ concl ] .",
    "according to our results , balanced loss and gain appears not only in pt - symmetric systems in optics and photonics , but is a more general phenomenon that can be seen also in other systems .",
    "it is therefore of great value for applications .",
    "the calculation of the eigenvalues @xmath2 and eigenfunctions @xmath3 of a non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath4 hits upon some mathematically non - trivial problems due to the existence of singular points in the continuum . at these points ,",
    "two eigenvalues coalesce and are supplemented by an associated vector defined by the jordan chain relations @xcite .",
    "the two corresponding eigenfunctions differ from one another only by a phase @xcite .",
    "the geometric phase of these points differs from the berry phase of a diabolic point by a factor 2 .",
    "these singular points , well - known in mathematics @xcite , are called mostly exceptional points ( eps ) .",
    "their meaning for the dynamics of open quantum systems and the behavior of the two eigenfunctions at and near to an ep is studied only recently .",
    "let us consider , as an example , the symmetric @xmath5 matrix @xmath6 with @xmath7 or with @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the diagonal elements of ( [ form1 ] ) are the two complex eigenvalues @xmath10 of the non - hermitian operator @xmath11 .",
    "that means , the @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the energies and widths , respectively , of the two states when @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath15 stand for the coupling matrix elements of the two states via the common environment which are , generally , complex @xcite .",
    "the selfenergy of the states is assumed to be included into the @xmath16 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath1 allows us to consider the properties of the system near to and at an ep because here the distance between the two states , that coalesce at the ep , relative to one another is much smaller than that relative to the other states of the system .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath1 are @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 stand for the energy and width , respectively , of the eigenstates @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the parametrical variation of the eigenvalues at the ep does not follow fermi s golden rule . instead",
    ", the resonance states repel each other in energy according to re@xmath22 while the widths bifurcate according to im@xmath23 .",
    "the transition from level repulsion to width bifurcation is studied numerically in e.g. @xcite .",
    "the two states cross when @xmath24 . here , the two eigenvalues coalesce , @xmath25 ; are supplemented by an associated vector @xcite ; and the crossing point is an ep in agreement with the definition of kato @xcite .",
    "further , the eigenfunctions of a non - hermitian @xmath4 must fulfill the conditions @xmath26 and @xmath27 where @xmath2 is an eigenvalue of @xmath4 and the vectors @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote its right and left eigenfunctions , respectively .",
    "when @xmath4 is a hermitian operator , the @xmath2 are real , and we arrive at the well - known relation @xmath30 . in this case , the eigenfunctions can be normalized by using the expression @xmath31 .",
    "for the symmetric non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath1 , however , we have @xmath32 .",
    "this means , that the eigenfunctions are biorthogonal and have to be normalized by means of @xmath33 .",
    "this is , generally , a _ complex _",
    "value , in contrast to the real value @xmath31 of the hermitian case . to smoothly describe the transition from a closed system with discrete states , to a weakly open one with narrow resonance states ,",
    "we normalize the @xmath3 according to @xmath34 ( for details see sections 2.2 and 2.3 of @xcite ) .",
    "it follows @xmath35 and @xmath36 at an ep @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath3 contain ( like the @xmath2 ) global features that are caused by many - body forces induced by the coupling @xmath39 of the states @xmath20 and @xmath40 via the environment ( which has an infinite number of degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath2 and eigenfunctions @xmath3 contain moreover the self - energy contributions of the states @xmath20 due to their coupling to the environment .    the schrdinger equation with the non - hermitian operator @xmath41 is equivalent to a schrdinger equation with @xmath11 and source term @xmath42 due to the source term , two states are coupled via the common environment of scattering wavefunctions into which the system is embedded , @xmath43 .",
    "the schrdinger equation ( [ form1a ] ) with source term can be rewritten in the following manner @xcite , @xmath44 ) and ( [ int5 ] ) of the eigenfunctions of @xmath41 , ( [ form2a ] ) is a nonlinear equation .",
    "most important part of the nonlinear contributions is contained in @xmath45 the nonlinear source term vanishes far from an ep where @xmath46 and @xmath47 as follows from the normalization ( [ int3 ] ) .",
    "thus , the schrdinger equation with source term is ( almost ) linear far from an ep , as usually assumed .",
    "it is however nonlinear in the neighborhood of an ep .",
    "it is meaningful to represent the eigenfunctions @xmath3 of @xmath41 in the set of basic wavefunctions @xmath48 of @xmath11 @xmath49 also the @xmath50 are normalized according to the biorthogonality relations of the wavefunctions @xmath51 .",
    "the angle @xmath52 can be determined from @xmath53 .",
    "an ep is a point in the continuum and therefore of measure zero .",
    "it can be identified only due to its influence on the eigenstates of the localized system in a certain finite parameter range around the ep .",
    "this influence is visible , indeed , as the results of many calculations have shown ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one of the consequences is that more than two states can not cross in one point since every state near to an ep will interact with states that are modified by the ep ( and not with the original states ) . under this condition ,",
    "the ranges of influence of different eps overlap , meaning that some clustering of eps occurs @xcite .    at the ep ,",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath54 of @xmath41 of the two crossing states differ from one another only by a phase , @xmath55 according to analytical as well as numerical and experimental studies @xcite .",
    "that means , the wavefunction @xmath56 of the state @xmath57 jumps at the ep to  @xmath58 .",
    "the biorthogonality of the eigenfunctions @xmath59 of the non - hermitian operator @xmath1 is characterized quantitatively by the ratio @xmath60 we call @xmath61 , defined by ( [ eif11 ] ) , the _ phase rigidity _ of the eigenfunction @xmath59 .",

    "here , the phase rigidity varies rapidly between its minimum and maximum values . in more detail",
    ", it vanishes at an ep according to the expectation ( see section [ eig ] ) and increases , completely unexpected , up to its maximum value ( nearly one ) when width bifurcation ( level repulsion ) is maximum .",
    "according to the definition ( [ eif11 ] ) of the phase rigidity , this means that the two eigenfunctions are ( almost ) orthogonal when width bifurcation ( level repulsion ) is maximum . here",

    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "the physical meaning of this result consists in the fact that the localized part of the system gets stabilized . in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , one of the two states receives a very short lifetime due to width bifurcation , and becomes ( almost ) indistinguishable from the states of the environment . although this process seems to be reversible according to the subfigures for the _ eigenvalues _ ,",
    "this is in reality not the case as can be seen from the subfigures for the _ eigenfunctions_. as mentioned above , the processes occurring in approaching @xmath116 , take place exclusively by means of the nonlinear source term of the schrdinger equation ( [ form3a ] ) near to an ep ( since @xmath98 is fixed in the calculations ) .",
    "they provide states that are non - analytically connected to the original states . due to these processes ,",
    "the long - lived state has `` lost '' its short - lived partner with the consequence that the two original states can not be reproduced by further variations of the parameter .",
    "the parametric evolution is irreversible .",
    "the long - lived state is more stable than the original one ( according to its longer lifetime ) , and the system as a whole ( which has lost one state ) is more stable than originally .",
    "the wavefunction of this long - lived state is mixed in those of the original states .    in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , level repulsion of states with similar lifetimes causes a separation of the states in energy .",
    "due to level repulsion , the two states separate from one another in energy , such that their interaction with one another is , eventually , of the same type as that with all the other distant states of the system .",
    "that means , each of the original states has `` lost '' its partner , also in this case ; and the reproduction of the two originally neighbored states is prevented . as a result , the interaction of the states of the system via the environment is reduced ( since all states are distant in energy ) . in difference to the case with width bifurcation , however , the number of states of the system as a whole remains unchanged .",
    "according to this discussion , the results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] can be understood since the parametrical evolution of the system is irreversible ( what is marked in the figures by the change of the color of all the trajectories at the final point of respective evolution ) .",
    "eventually , the system as a whole is stabilized at the point of , respectively , maximum width bifurcation and maximum level repulsion ; can be described quite well by a hermitian hamilton operator the eigenfunctions of which are orthogonal ( corresponding to @xmath117 ) ; and the finite lifetime of the states is hidden , to a great extent .",
    "thus , our results presented in figs . [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] show the important role , which the singular eps play in open quantum systems when the system consists of a number of _ neighboring , typically individual states_. the parametrical evolution of a system with more than two states is studied in @xcite .",
    "the irreversible processes of stabilization of the system appear also in this case .",
    "they are even stronger in the multi - level case than in the two - level case considered here .",

    "indeed , the phase rigidity approaches the value zero at an ep while it approaches the value one at the point of maximum width bifurcation and maximum level repulsion , respectively .",
    "the shape of the @xmath78 trajectories at the eps is determined by the fact that the variation of @xmath78 occurs more slowly at one side than at the other one .",

    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "the tuning parameter @xmath131 ( which characterizes the _ mean _ coupling strength of the states of the system to the environment ) is assumed , usually , to be real and to increase linearly from zero up to @xmath132 . at the critical value @xmath133",

    "accordingly , the wavefunctions of the states are ( almost ) orthogonal at small @xmath131 and become mixed beyond the restructuring ( being a second - order phase transition ) @xcite .",
    "this picture arises when  in addition to the eigenvalues  also the eigenfunctions are considered .",
    "it can be seen qualitatively also in fig .",
    "[ fig3].e : the wavefunctions are _ not _ mixed when @xmath127 approaches zero ( and the levels are distant from one another ) , while they become mixed when @xmath134 ( and the widths bifurcate ) ; see also fig . 1 in @xcite where the convergence of distant levels in approaching @xmath135 is shown . in any case",
    ", the eigenfunctions are biorthogonal also for small @xmath131 what is proven even experimentally @xcite .",
    "the studies in section [ num ] show that the nonlinear source term of the schrdinger equation ( [ form3a ] ) strengthens and accelerates ( as a function of the parameter @xmath83 ) considerably the separation of the states around an ep in energy and lifetime , respectively .",
    "the appearance of a dynamical phase transition will therefore be visible also in the representation of the results in a figure like fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] when the linear relation @xmath136 for all @xmath83 ( from @xmath137 to @xmath132 ) is replaced , at certain @xmath83 values , by a nonlinear one due to the nonlinear source term of the schrdinger equation ( [ form3a ] ) near an ep .",
    "in such a case , the phase rigidity will approach quickly the value @xmath117 also for large @xmath138 ; and @xmath131 will not increase limitless .",
    "correspondingly to this picture , the approximation @xmath128 can be applied to the description of a multi - level system _ only _ near to and at the dynamical phase transition ; and the states on both sides of the transition are non - analytically related to one another @xcite .    in the paper @xcite ,",
    "the wavefunctions of the states are described randomly ; and the approach that @xmath131 depends everywhere linearly on @xmath83 , is used .",

    "it is applied to the energy transport in photosynthetic light - harvesting complexes .",
    "the influence of eps is not considered in these papers . according to our results and the discussion in sects .",
    "[ num ] and [ disc ] , superradiance ( or resonance trapping ) is a clear hint to a dynamical phase transition .",

    "the relation between system and environment on the one hand and the measuring process on the other hand is illustrated for a mesoscopic system in fig . 1 of @xcite .",
    "another experimental result concerns the tunneling effect due to which , according to standard quantum mechanics , electrons can escape from atoms under the influence of strong laser fields .",
    "recently , the tunneling delay time is measured in helium by attosecond ionization @xcite .",
    "the experimental results _ give a strong evidence that there is no real tunneling delay time _ @xcite .",
    "this result is in complete agreement with ( [ int6 ] ) according to which the escape time is nothing but the imaginary part of the eigenvalue of the non - hermitian hamiltonian , @xmath139 .",
    "whether or not the new experimental results @xcite on the violation of the bell inequality can be related to the basic assumptions of our calculations needs further investigations .",
    "see also the papers @xcite . in any case , a spooky action at a distance is possible only at and near to an ep where the interaction via the environment between two states approaches an infintely large value , as the results of our calculations show ( figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) .    as a conclusion we state that there are some differences between a dynamical phase transition in an open quantum system and the phenomenon of pt - symmetry breaking , in spite of many obvious similarities .",
    "the dynamical phase transition is a very general and robust phenomenon .",
    "we expect interesting results similar to those obtained for pt - symmetric systems in optics and photonics with balanced loss and gain , in the near future also in other systems .",
