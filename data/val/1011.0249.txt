    "galaxy clusters are the most massive gravitationally bound systems in the universe .",
    "their study has been pursued for many different astrophysical and cosmological reasons : their mass function allows for the determination of the several cosmological parameters , including the mass density , @xmath6 , and the matter power spectrum normalization @xmath7 @xcite as well as the dark energy equation of state @xcite and neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "furthermore , cluster surveys allow the determination of their clustering properties inferring information on the large scale structure @xcite . due to their high galaxy density , clusters are excellent laboratories for studying galaxy evolution @xcite .",
    "clusters can also be used as gravitational lenses , providing a way to constrain their masses , as well as to study distant galaxies @xcite .",
    "more recently , cluster abundances and internal structure have been invoked as test for modified gravity @xcite .",
    "clusters are observed in several bands : in the optical through the overdensity of galaxies or their color properties , and in the radio and x  ray through the emission of the intra ",
    "cluster medium . while optical observations were the first ones to be performed , x  ray surveys of the past twenty years have discovered hundreds of clusters up to high redshifts ( @xmath8 ) , while radio surveys aiming at detecting galaxy clusters through their sunyaev",
    " zeldovich ( sz ) effect are underway .",
    "this plethora of data reinvigorates the interest in galaxy clusters as it will provide a better understanding of cluster physics and the selection function for each detection method , therefore improving the precision in deriving cosmological constraints .    in this paper , we focus on optical observations of clusters in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , presenting the cluster catalog constructed from an adaptive match filter ( amf ) technique @xcite .",
    "sdss provides luminosities in five bands and redshift estimates for millions of galaxies in more than one - fifth of the sky .",
    "this has allowed automated algorithms to compile catalogs of clusters objectively by identifying overdensities in galaxy distributions .",
    "three such optical cluster catalogs include the maxbcg catalog @xcite constructed from sdss dr5 , another catalog from sdss dr6 constructed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , whl ) , and the gaussian mixture brightest cluster galaxy catalog ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , gmbcg ) which is based on sdss dr7 .",
    "the maxbcg catalog makes use of a ridgeline in @xmath9 magnitudes to determine photometric redshifts and cluster membership .",
    "the catalog by whl uses a friends - of - friends algorithm to associate galaxies above a specific luminosity cut .",
    "the gmbcg catalog is a follow - up to the maxbcg catalog that extends the redshift range to @xmath10 and uses statistics gathered from the maxbcg catalog to refine the cluster finding procedure .",
    "given the diverse nature of clusters , one should not expect to detect the same object when different methods are applied to the same data .",
    "comparisons between methods allow for a better understanding of selection biases of each method .",
    "we present here the catalog extracted from the sdss dr6 by applying the amf technique tailored to handle sdss data ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , d08 ) and provide a comparison with the maxbcg and gmbcg samples .",
    "we also compare our catalog with the whl catalog , which was also derived from dr6 data . while our finder also uses overdensities as a starting point for determining the presence of a cluster , it does not make",
    "_ a priori _ assumptions about the color or number of bright galaxies .",
    "this approach potentially allows for the detection of clusters which do not have a bright red galaxy .",
    "moreover , our finder only relies on extremizing a likelihood function , which provides a very general method for characterizing cluster properties such as their size , richness and core radius during their detection .",
    "clusters may also be detected in the x  ray band , which traces their diffuse gas component .",
    "both x  ray and optical observations are used to determine cluster masses and derive cosmology .",
    "however , these two bands trace different physical components of the cluster , so they represent quite different probes of the state of the cluster . selection effects for optical and x  ray are different , and each method for estimating masses may have intrinsic biases and limitations .",
    "now that big optical cluster samples are available , it is possible to assess to what extent optical and x  ray properties are related and probe the reliability of various methods for mass estimate and cosmology derivation . in addition , galaxy clusters have now been detected via their sz effect @xcite .",
    "comparisons between the optical properties and the sz effect @xcite using the planck early release compact source catalog @xcite will be the subject of a future paper .    as a fist step in this direction ,",
    "various authors have measured scaling relations between x - ray observables such as luminosity ( l@xmath11 ) and temperature ( t@xmath11 ) and optical richness @xcite .",
    "while the richness measure used did nt seem to correlate well with x ",
    "ray luminosity , the lensing - derived mass for richness bin showed a remarkable correlation with l@xmath11 .",
    "these results were based on shallower and smaller optical cluster samples than the one presented here as they only relied on a sample on the order of 100 matches . here",
    "we provide the x ",
    "ray matches for our amf cluster sample with all available x  ray cluster data from the bax database and with the flux limited noras samples @xcite .",
    "we also measure scaling relations between optical richness and x  ray properties for matching clusters .",
    "we find good correlation between optical richness and both x  ray luminosity and temperature .",
    "a feature of galaxy clusters that is often considered for its own study is the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) . as part of this work",
    ", we determined the three brightest galaxies in any cluster in the @xmath1-band and include a list of them as potential bcgs .",
    "these can be used as a further basis for comparison between our clusters and those in the maxbcg and other catalogs . moreover",
    ", bcgs can be exploited as tracers of large scale structure in cross correlation analysis with other catalogs @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of a sub - sample of bcgs selected to be the brightest and to have z@xmath120.3 in terms of colors and x  ray and uv counterparts is presented in a companion paper @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ data_sect ]",
    ", we discuss the specifics of the sdss data used .",
    "we present the amf cluster finder and details on its application to the sdss data in section [ finder_sect ] .",
    "section [ cat_sect ] discusses the characterization of the galaxy cluster catalog and of the related bcgs sample . in section [ comp_sect ]",
    "we compare our catalog with the maxbcg , whl , and gmbcg ones , as well as with x  ray cluster catalogs .",
    "section [ conc_sect ] is dedicated to the conclusions .    unless stated otherwise , we assume a @xmath13cdm cosmology , with @xmath6  =  0.3 and @xmath14  =  0.7 , and h@xmath15  =  100 h km  s@xmath16  mpc@xmath16 .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey @xcite is a five - band ccd imaging survey of @xmath17 @xmath18 in the high latitude north galactic cap and a smaller deeper region in the south , followed by an extensive multi - fiber spectroscopic survey .",
    "the imaging survey is carried out in drift- scan mode in five sdss filters ( u , g , r , i , z ) to a limiting magnitude of @xmath19 for 50@xmath20 completeness @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic survey targets @xmath21 galaxies to approximately @xmath22 , with a median redshift of @xmath23 , and a smaller deeper sample of @xmath24 luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) out to about @xmath25 . in this paper",
    "we construct a cluster catalog for data release 6 ( dr6 ) and chose to use the photometric redshifts provided by @xcite . in total",
    ", we have redshift information for @xmath26 of 67.6 million galaxies that covered @xmath278,420 deg@xmath28 in stripes 9 - 39 , 42 - 44 , 76 , 82 and 86 . in this sample , there are 7.4 @xmath29 10@xmath30 with spectra . the median error for photometric redshift ( z@xmath31 ) measurements",
    "all galaxy measurements were extracted from the galaxy view on the casjobs dr6 database using the flags as described in appendix [ phot_flags_app ] to limit our sample to galaxies with good photometry .",
    "we use the cc2 photo - z estimates in order to avoid a possible bias from applying the luminosity function twice , once in the choice of photometric redshifts and again as part of the amf likelihood calculation .",
    "it is important to understand the errors in photometric redshifts when using our technique , as we explain below .",
    "we used the photometric redshifts provided by @xcite in preference to those from @xcite , even though the latter were available for the whole of dr6 , because the errors on z@xmath31 for @xcite were underestimated .",
    "the oyaizu _",
    "et al _ errors on z@xmath31 are much closer to the errors @xmath32 estimated from the sub - sample of galaxies which have spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the @xcite estimates would bias our redshift filter in such a way that would eliminate galaxies that should be considered as possibly belonging to a given cluster .",
    "the width of the filter is determined by the error estimate in redshift .",
    "also , the @xcite sample is truncated at an @xmath1-band magnitude of 22 .",
    "this is important , as the behavior of the luminosity function that we use is not well - understood above this magnitude . in addition , the coverage for the region of the sky over which we are constructing our catalog is much more uniform for the redshifts provided by @xcite than for those provided by @xcite for sdss dr6 .",
    "simulations using a mock galaxy catalog indicated that this procedure should lead to a catalog that is @xmath3390@xmath20 complete at least to @xmath34 ( d08 ) .",
    "the current catalog is constructed using @xmath1-band data information only , although the code could be extended to make use of information in all bands .",
    "figure [ sky ] shows the distribution of clusters in our catalog on the sky .",
    "we will assess data based on the continuity and completeness of its redshift estimates for future releases of amf cluster catalogs .",
    "the cluster finder that we employ is based on the matched filter concept @xcite .",
    "a complete description of the method used here as well as results of testing on mock data is available in d08 .",
    "the matched filter technique adopted here is a likelihood method which identifies clusters by convolving the optical galaxy survey with a set of filters based on a modeling of the cluster and field galaxy distributions .",
    "a cluster radial surface density profile , a galaxy luminosity function , and redshift information ( either photometric or spectroscopic when available ) are used to construct filters in position , magnitude , and redshift space , from which a cluster likelihood map is generated .",
    "the peaks in the map thus correspond to candidate cluster centers where the matches between the survey data and the cluster filters are optimized .",
    "the algorithm automatically provides the probability for the detection , best - fit estimates of cluster properties including redshift , radius and richness , as well as a framework for membership assessment for each galaxy .",
    "the cluster finding algorithm computes the likelihood on a grid whose points are centered on the positions of galaxies .",
    "the finder uses an iterative procedure that determines which galaxy maximizes the difference in likelihood from the previous step that a cluster exists that is centered on that galaxy . this cluster",
    "is then added to the list of identified clusters , and the procedure continues with the remaining galaxies .",
    "the parameters of the new cluster ( redshift @xmath35 , core radius @xmath36 and richness @xmath2 ) are varied in order to maximize its likelihood increment .",
    "the radius @xmath3 of the cluster is determined by computing at which distance from the central galaxy the overdensity of galaxies is 200 times the critical density , assuming the average galaxy density is representative of the mean mass density .",
    "the richness is the total luminosity within @xmath3 in terms of @xmath37 , where @xmath37 evolves passively as a function of redshift , brightening by 0.8 mag from @xmath38 to @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "we assume that @xmath37 does not vary with the cluster richness , but see @xcite and section 4.3 .",
    "the cluster finding procedure is stopped when the natural logarithm of the likelihood for any new cluster is below zero .",
    "( for the remainder of this paper , any mention of a value of the likelihood refers to the @xmath40 . ) from this sample of cluster candidates , all clusters with richness @xmath41 10 are chosen for recentering , which is described below .",
    "since the matched filter technique does not explicitly use the information about the red sequence to select clusters as in some color - based cluster - finding methods @xcite , it can theoretically detect clusters of any type in color , and is not restricted only to old , red e / s0 galaxies .",
    "such clusters likely dominate the cluster population , but may not constitute all of it especially as one probes systems of lower richness and at higher redshifts .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for further discussion on this issue .      by applying this cluster finder to simulations",
    ", d08 demonstrated that , with a richness cut at @xmath42 20 , the results of this finder are over 95@xmath20 complete for objects with @xmath43 2.0 @xmath29 10@xmath44 and @xmath2785@xmath20 complete for objects with @xmath43 1.0 @xmath29 10@xmath44 in the redshift range 0.10 @xmath45 z @xmath45 0.45 .",
    "these authors also showed that the finder produces a catalog that is over 95@xmath20 pure for clusters with @xmath46 30 and 90@xmath20 pure for clusters with @xmath46 20 over all redshifts z @xmath45 0.45 .",
    "no testing has been performed on deeper simulations , so that we are not in the position of making statements of purity and completeness for any redshift beyond @xmath47 .",
    "the initial run of the finder produces clusters that are centered on observed galaxies .",
    "however , there is no reason to assume that the actual center of mass for the cluster should necessarily be located on a galaxy .    in general , finding the correct center of mass of a cluster is important for several reasons : @xmath48 for mass estimation with the lensing effect , as clusters are stacked one on top of the other ; @xmath49 for comparison with measurement of the cluster in other bands , @xmath50 for assessing velocity dispersions and therefore kinetic mass estimates of the cluster ; @xmath51 for the purpose of cross  correlations with other surveys and cmb maps .",
    "moreover , trying to determine cluster s properties that rely on a spherical model while not using the correct center may lead to determining them poorly and assigning a bigger error to them .",
    "for all these reasons , after the clusters have been identified , it is necessary to relax the hypothesis that clusters are centered on a galaxy and refine the center position as well as the characterizations of the clusters .",
    "we therefore recompute the cluster s likelihood for each cluster in the sample by varying the new hypothetical center on a fine grid of resolution 1 h@xmath16 kpc and whose extent is the core radius , r@xmath52 . about 37@xmath20 of the clusters have their center shifted by at least 1 h@xmath53 kpc ; the average displacement for clusters whose center is measurably displaced is 65@xmath54 h@xmath16 kpc .",
    "all other quantities ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 ) are recomputed for the new angular position .",
    "the procedure outlined above finds 69,173 clusters with @xmath42 20 in dr6 .",
    "these clusters are distributed over 66,231 unique sites in angular and redshift space . to determine unique sites , we first determine which galaxies have a high likelihood of belonging to each cluster .",
    "we then determine the three brightest galaxies in the @xmath1-band for each cluster .",
    "clusters which share any of the three brightest members are said to belong to the same site . the cluster with the highest likelihood at a given site is said to be the primary cluster .",
    "since the richness scales as the likelihood , this is also the richest cluster at a site .    to assign galaxies to a particular cluster ,",
    "we make a list of all galaxies ( @xmath57 ) that may belong to a cluster ( @xmath58 ) such that the angular displacement of the galaxy from a cluster center is less than @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xmath45 3@xmath61 . here , @xmath61 is the estimate of the error in photometric redshift assigned to the galaxy in sdss dr6 and d@xmath62 is the angular diameter distance to the galaxy , @xmath57 .",
    "this is not a final membership list for the set of clusters , but a set of galaxies that could contribute , however minimally , to the likelihood and richness of a cluster . for galaxies within @xmath3 of the center of the cluster",
    ", we then find the likelihood of the cluster when it is missing galaxy @xmath57 .",
    "the difference between the likelihood of the cluster with all members included and the likelihood when missing galaxy @xmath57 is referred to as the likelihood difference , @xmath63 .",
    "we then assign memberships of galaxies to a cluster by selecting galaxies that lie within @xmath3 from the cluster s center , and have at least @xmath64 . with this threshold",
    ", we can assign member galaxies to @xmath3399.4@xmath20 of the clusters .",
    "this cutoff preserves galaxies with a spectroscopic redshift measurement that is close to the redshift of the cluster as cluster members .",
    "selecting a cutoff of @xmath65 quickly reduces the percentage of clusters with members assigned , and a cutoff @xmath66 includes too many bright galaxies with no redshift estimate .",
    "this choice of cutoff also reduces the median value of the error in photometric redshift for galaxies chosen to be cluster members to 0.062 .",
    "we do not apply a prescribed redshift cut because the high likelihood cut applied already ensures that the selected galaxies are close to the cluster s center .",
    "the galaxies selected with this criterion are included in the catalog ( see table [ app_mem ] ) .    by using this method to determine the brightest galaxies in a cluster and requiring that the brightest galaxies can only belong to one site , we determine that @xmath455@xmath20 of sites have more than one cluster attributed to them .",
    "we choose to retain these blended clusters in the catalog as possible subjects of cluster mergers .",
    "we also want to know how these sites compare with detections in other bands .",
    "lastly , these blended clusters provide insight into the amf filter detection method .",
    "in this section we present the amf cluster catalog and the associated bcg .",
    "we present its main properties including richness , redshift distribution , core radius with associated errors .",
    "we describe how the bcg catalog is assembled and present its main properties in the @xmath1 band .",
    "a description on how the data are released and how to retrieve them is in the appendix .",
    "the catalog contains 69,173 clusters with @xmath42 20 over an area of @xmath278,420 deg@xmath28 .",
    "results of the cluster finder applied to simulations ( d08 ) associate this richness threshold with an approximate mass of @xmath67 , according to :    @xmath68    .    using this result from the simulation as a guideline",
    ", we detect that there are about 5000 clusters in our new amf sdss catalog with a mass above @xmath69 ( roughly corresponding to richness 50 ) ; 2700 of which are nearer than @xmath34 .",
    "it should be kept in mind , however , that eq.[eq : scr ] was derived on the basis of simulations where the galaxy colors were assigned to dark matter particles , so this result may not necessarily correspond precisely to what we observe in nature .",
    "the exponent in the relation is different from one only by statistical error , and merely reflects the mass  to  light ratio of cluster galaxies assumed in the simulations .",
    "a proper calibration of the mass  richness relation should be made by evaluating masses for this sample possibly with different methods .",
    "this issue will be properly addressed in a future paper .",
    "the position of the clusters in the sky is represented in fig .",
    "it is clearly not homogeneous , as photometric redshifts are not determined in a uniform way on the sky the density of clusters varies from stripe to stripe , with an average number of clusters per deg@xmath28 of 7.2 .",
    "the distribution of cluster density per deg@xmath28 varies between 5.46.0 ( stripes 43 - 44,76,82 , and 86 ) , 6.07.2 ( stripes 9 - 37 ) and @xmath33 9 ( stripes 38 - 39 ) .",
    "the smallest density belongs to stripe 42 which has 4.04 clusters per deg@xmath28 , and the largest density is in stripe 38 at 9.37 clusters per deg@xmath28 .",
    "we are confident that the variations in cluster density in stripes 937 are due to large - scale structure .",
    "more work is needed to understand the density variations in other stripes .    the distribution of our clusters in richness for different redshift bins is shown in fig .",
    "[ amf_rh_hist ] .",
    "as expected , the ratio of high richness objects over low richness ones decreases for increasing redshift .",
    "the richest clusters have richness values 168 , 254 , 270 , 226 , and 172 in subsequent redshift bins with @xmath70 starting at @xmath71 .",
    "note that the catalog is clearly not complete for z@xmath330.5 .",
    "for this reason , the considerable drop in the number of very rich clusters compared to the low richness ones , although expected to a certain extent for structure formation reasons , may in fact be due to limitations of our searching method .",
    "a proper assessment of this issue would require comparison with other cluster finders performances at high redshifts or better understanding of this cluster finder on sdss deeper data .",

    "errors in @xmath2 were measured as a function of @xmath2 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",

    "several studies have indicated that the fit of an nfw profile for optical clusters tends to have a large error in core radius , @xmath56 , and that in some cases , a function with either a core or a cusp in the density at the center of the cluster gives an adequate description @xcite .",
    "our error analysis similarly finds the core radius to be poorly constrained in most cases . as with the other parameters ,",
    "the error in core radius is smallest for the richest clusters , with errors falling between 14@xmath20 and 36@xmath20 for half of the 327 clusters with @xmath87 100 .",
    "for the 43,600 clusters with 20 @xmath88 30 , the endpoints of this range shift to 46@xmath20 and 87@xmath20 .",
