    "the aim of spin foam quantization is to provide a non  pertubative and background  independent quantization of gravity via an auxiliary discretization .",
    "a key outstanding question for these models is to show that they reproduce familiar low energy physics , in particular a phase describing a smooth manifold , in a limit in which the scale of the discretization is much smaller than other relevant length scales in the system @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will provide first conjectures on the possible large scale behaviour of spin foams .",
    "these are based on the investigation of the coarse graining or renormalization flow of spin net models , which , as we will show in this work , can be interpreted as a coarse graining flow of ( melonic ) spin foams and as describing the effective coupling between two spin foam vertices .    to lay out the context of this work , explicit investigations of the coarse graining and renormalization flow of spin foam models @xcite ,",
    "have been hindered by the overwhelming complexity of the models , apart from an incomplete understanding of possible infinities @xcite and a number of conceptual questions @xcite , for instance the meaning of scale in coarse graining background independent systems .",
    "regarding these questions a conceptual understanding was reached in @xcite , that allows to interpret the coarse graining flow as the construction of the continuum limit of the theory via the concept of dynamical cylindrical consistency and embedding or refinement maps . to tackle the concrete implementation of this coarse graining flow , after establishing the importance of coarse graining for the recovery of diffeomorphism symmetries in discrete systems and therefore the recovery of a correct continuum dynamics @xcite ,",
    "a program was started in @xcite , which considers the corresponding question in simplified systems , that keep however key dynamical principles , in particular the imposition of so  called simplicity constraints @xcite , of spin foams .",
    "the simplifications considered can be summarized into three types : ( a ) the replacement of the structure group @xmath2 of the full gravitational models by a finite group @xcite , ( b ) a dimensional reduction of spin foams to so  called spin nets @xcite , and ( c ) the consideration of a regular lattice @xcite .    in this work",
    "we lift the simplification ( a ) , regarding ( b ) we show that spin net coarse graining can be interpreted as a coarse graining of ( melonic ) spin foams and confirm again @xcite that ( c ) does lead to triangulation invariant models , at least for the non  critical fixed points .",
    "this latter fact is deeply related to the restoration of a notion of diffeomorphism symmetry @xcite at the fixed points .",
    "in fact the recovery of a sensible continuum limit and the regaining of diffeomorphism symmetry might even be only possible if certain regularity conditions on the coarse graining process are satisfied @xcite .",
    "for these reasons we will be able to present for the first time and @xmath3 pachner moves for spin foam models based on finite groups .",
    "however , as mentioned , the question arises whether such a flow , based on coarse graining moves @xcite only , allows to make definite conclusions about the continuum limit .",
    "in contrast the tensor network algorithm @xcite considered here includes , in a sense , refining , coarse graining , and entangling moves @xcite . ] the coarse graining flow in a non  trivial spin foam system and investigate the fixed points it leads to .",
    "this allows us to draw first conclusions about the possible phases that might describe the continuum limit of spin foams .    to be more precise ,",
    "we introduce here spin net models with structure group @xmath4 , the quantum deformation ( at the root of unity ) of the group @xmath5 .",
    "this makes a numerical investigation of the models possible , as in the quantum group only finitely many representations appear . on the technical level",
    "this requires the introduction of the haar projector for the quantum group which we construct in this work .",
    "models based on the quantum deformation of the rotation group describe gravitational systems with a cosmological constant @xcite . for the 4d systems one would need @xmath6 , however also an effective description in terms of @xmath4 alone might be possible @xcite .",
    "thus we lift the simplification , considered in @xcite , of the structure group almost completely . moreover considering the behaviour of the models for growing level @xmath7",
    "allows to make conjectures on the limit @xmath8 , which gives back the classical group @xmath5 .    as in previous work @xcite",
    "we will employ tensor network techniques @xcite to derive a coarse graining flow equation , which is then investigated numerically .",
    "this flow equation describes the change of intertwiner degrees of freedom under coarse graining , as exemplified for the first time in @xcite .",
    "as is outlined in @xcite these tensor network techniques are particularly suited for the construction of the continuum limit for spin nets and spin foams . in @xcite",
    "a tensor network representation of spin foams appeared which might allow to derive similar coarse graining flow equations directly for spin foams .",
    "also @xcite points out , that the geometric building blocks of spin foams , the simplices , allow to be interpreted as coarse graining , refining or entangling moves , in dependence of how these are glued together .",
    "such moves are the basic ingredients of tensor network renormalization .",
    "this might lead to an even more geometric way to derive such coarse graining flow equations .",
    "another innovation that we present in this work is a change in the parametrization for the ( phase ) space of spin net and spin foam models .",
    "this new parametrization takes the lesson from @xcite seriously , that the relevant degrees of freedom are given by intertwiners .",
    "we thus introduce a new parametrization , based on reisenberger s construction principle @xcite , that leads us to employ so  called _ fixed point intertwiners _ @xcite , which encode the simplicity constraints .",
    "reisenberger s principle ensures that the models so obtained are physically reasonable , i.e. that the simplicity constraints they encode appear to be the same in ( physically equivalent ) different recoupling schemes .",
    "we will find that this new parametrization is highly advantageous : in contrast to the parametrization introduced in @xcite and employed in @xcite , models flow generically to non  trivial fixed points ( in particular different from the degenerate fixed point , in which only the spin representation @xmath9 appears ) .",
    "we conjecture that this behaviour is due to the projector property that is satisfied for models based on fixed point intertwiners .",
    "modern spin foams are rather based on a parametrization like that employed in @xcite , and the reconstruction of the projector property is rather complicated @xcite .",
    "the findings here therefore suggest to reconsider reisenberger s construction principle , in particular since it allows the construction of vertices of arbitrary valence @xcite , as was also later realized for the eprl model @xcite in @xcite .",
    "similar to the arguments on the uniqueness of the barrett  crane model @xcite in @xcite , it is even possible to find a parametrization of all physically sensible models , by finding all fixed point intertwiners for a given structure group @xcite .",
    "+ the outline of the paper is the following : the next section [ sec : reisenberger ] introduces the basic ingredients of spin foam and spin net models that we need for the work here .",
    "it will also explain the parametrization for the models based on reisenberger s construction principle , for which we need the fixed point intertwiners . in section [ quantum - group ]",
    "we introduce the essential notions and tools related with the quantum group @xmath0 that will be needed to define spin net models based on this group . using these tools",
    "we introduce the general structure of our models in section [ structurespinnets ] . in section [ coarse ]",
    "we adapt to the quantum group case the symmetry preserving coarse graining algorithm introduced in @xcite .",
    "this will lead to a flow equation describing the behaviour of intertwiner degrees of freedom under coarse graining",
    ". we will give a ( 3d ) geometrical interpretation of the flow equation which might lead to a more intuitive understanding of the coarse graining flow .",
    "section [ results ] contains the explicit definition of the weights for the initial models .",
    "we then investigate the behaviour under coarse graining of these models and analyze and describe the results obtained .",
    "we comment on the interpretation of spin net coarse graining in the context of spin foam coarse graining in section [ interpretation ] .",
    "we discuss our main findings in section [ discussion ] .",
    "finally appendix [ app ] includes technical ( diagrammatic ) calculations that might help the understanding of some equations in the main text , in particular those appearing in sections [ quantum - group ] and [ coarse ] .",
    "spin foam models are generalization of lattice gauge theories and as such are defined on 2complexes , i.e. generalizations of graphs , in which in addition to vertices and edges , also faces are specified .",
    "there is an important difference though : whereas for lattice gauge theories the main dynamical ingredient are weights on the faces , these weights are not as essential for the dynamics of spin foams ( they are crucial for the divergence properties of the model @xcite , but are not supposed to include i.e. a coupling constant ) . rather for the dynamics of spin foams",
    "the choice of an intertwiner for the edges is crucial ",
    "equivalent to choosing a certain implementation of the so called simplicity constraints .    to be more specific ,",
    "consider lattice gauge theory based on a gauge ( or structure ) group @xmath10 , which we assume to be either a compact semi ",
    "simple lie group or a finite group .",
    "the variables are given as group elements associated to oriented edges of a graph .",
    "the dynamics is encoded into face weights @xmath11 , which are class functions on the group .",
    "these face weights are evaluated on the face holonomies @xmath12 , i.e. the ( oriented ) product of group elements @xmath13 associated to the edges @xmath14 around a face @xmath15",
    ". let us assume that all edges agree in their orientation with the orientation induced from the face .",
    "the partition function is then given as [ i1 ] z=_e * d*g_e _ f _ f(h_f ) . here",
    "@xmath16 denotes the ( normalized ) haar measure on @xmath10 .",
    "we can change to a dual description by applying a group fourier transform .",
    "due to the invariance of the face weight under group conjugation we can expand the face weights as a linear combination of characters [ i2 ] _",
    "f(h ) = _ _ f ( ) _ ( h ) , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 denotes a matrix element of a irreducible unitary representation @xmath19 ( irreps ) of the group @xmath10 . in ( [ i2 ] )",
    "we sum over a complete set of ( equivalence classes ) of irreps .",
    "expanding @xmath12 into the product of group elements and using the representation property @xmath20 one finds that the partition function is now given as[i3 ] z=__f _ f _ f(_f ) _ e ( p^e_haar)_m_f_1 m_f_2 m_f_n_e^n_f_1 n_f_2 n_f_n_e . here",
    "@xmath21 is the so  called haar projector , which absorbs the integrations over the group elements @xmath22 in ( [ i1 ] ) . for an edge",
    "whose @xmath23 adjacent faces agree in orientation with the one of the edge the haar projector is given as [ ghaar ] ( p^e_haar)_m_f_1 m_f_2 m_f_n_e^n_f_1 n_f_2 n_f_n_e & = & * d*g _ f e _ f(g_e)_m_f^n_f .",
    "the group integration or averaging enforces gauge invariance .",
    "indeed the haar projector is an intertwining map between the group invariant ( singlet ) subspace of the tensor product of representations p_haar : ( v__1 v__n_e ) ( v__1 v__n_e ) or , if seen as a map on @xmath24 it acts as a projector onto @xmath25 .",
    "choosing any orthonormal basis themselves are referred to as intertwiners . ]",
    "@xmath26 in @xmath27 we can write the haar intertwiner as [ shaar ] p_haar = _ d |_d _ d | , which makes the projection property @xmath28 of @xmath29 obvious .",
    "as mentioned the important dynamical ingredient in spin foams are intertwiners , whereas the face weights are rather chosen due to kinematical considerations , for instance as delta functions on the group in the group representation . for non  trivial spin foam models ,",
    "that is models which can not be rewritten into standard lattice gauge theories , one replaces @xmath29 by a smaller projector @xmath30 , selecting a smaller subspace of @xmath27 .    with an appropriate choice of orthonormal basis of intertwiners",
    "we can write [ i6 ] p^(n)= _ d _",
    "n |_d _ d | , where @xmath31 denotes a subset of intertwiner labels specified by the choice of simplicity constraints .",
    "again the form ( [ i6 ] ) makes the projector property @xmath28 explicit . in the context of spin foams this projector property",
    "ensures a notion of ( weak ) independence of the underlying two  complex , namely invariance under edge subdivisions @xcite .    on the other hand",
    "the form ( [ i6 ] ) makes it non  obvious how to relate the sets @xmath31 for different valencies @xmath32 ( i.e. number of faces sharing the edge @xmath14 ) of the edges . to solve this problem ,",
    "reisenberger proposed the following principle in @xcite :     + * reisenberger s construction : * we consider multiplicity free representation categories , where in the reduction of the tensor product of any two irreps each irrep can only appear once . in this case , by choosing a recoupling scheme , intertwiners can be labelled by sets of representation labels : an intertwiner for valency @xmath32 is characterized by the @xmath32 representation labels plus @xmath33 further representation labels .",
    "note that the choice of recoupling scheme can be encoded in a three  valent graph with @xmath32 outer edges , and that the representation labels are attached to the edges of this graph .",
    "we will denote with @xmath34 the set of allowed representations implied by the simplicity constraints .    in reisenberger",
    "s construction this set @xmath34 then determines all the other sets @xmath31 via the following principle : for every possible choice of recoupling scheme , i.e. three  valent graph , only representations in @xmath34 should appear .",
    "+ reisenberger applies this to the barret - crane model @xcite and shows that choosing @xmath34 accordingly the intertwiners @xmath35 are uniquely determined .",
    "it actually turns out that if we take the intertwiner as a model for a partition function , as introduced in @xcite ( with boundary data given by the @xmath36 representation and summing over all the intertwiner labels ) the barrett - crane model leads even to a triangulation invariant model .",
    "spin net model @xcite , which is also topological . related , the barrett - crane intertwiner is given as a square of the @xmath1 intertwiner @xcite . ]    in @xcite so  called intertwiner models were introduced , which are 2d statistical models determining an intertwining map between representation spaces associated to the boundary components of the 2d bulk .",
    "the models are defined on three  valent graphs .",
    "dualizing these graphs we obtain a triangulation ( under certain regularity assumptions ) .",
    "it turns out that intertwiner models whose partition function are invariant under the change of ( 2d ) triangulation , are also  at least in the planar case  a realization of reisenberger s conditions .",
    "in particular each triangulation invariant model is characterized by a set @xmath34 of representations that are allowed to appear as intertwiner labels and as boundary data .",
    "let us explain this statement in more detail , restricting to four  valent intertwiners , i.e.   @xmath37 .",
    "fixing the 4 outer representations @xmath38 , a choice of intertwiner basis , labeled by @xmath39 , can then be represented graphically by the following three graphs @xmath40 : a=    ( -0.5,-0.75 )  ( 0,-0.25 )  ( 0,0.25 )  ( -0.5,0.75 ) ( 0.5,-0.75 )  ( 0,-0.25 ) ( 0,0.25 ) ",

    "note that a spin foam model defined via such a fixed point intertwiner does in general _ not _ define a fixed point of the renormalization flow in the space of spin foam models .",
    "the same holds for spin nets , that we will define as lower dimensional analogues of spin foams further below .",

    "nevertheless it is interesting to consider ( [ i8 ] ) for general coefficients , as it allows to obtain phase diagrams and in this way to determine phase transitions .",
    "the latter might allow to define a continuum limit theory with propagating degrees of freedom .",
    "the main result of this paper is the following : using these fixed point intertwiners to define ( 2d ) spin net models , these spin nets flow in general to ` non  trivial ' triangulation invariant models without the necessity of fine tuning .    here we mean with ` trivial ' fixed points , those in which no simplicity constraints occur , and which can be expressed as standard lattice gauge theories .",
    "e.g. for the so  called degenerate fixed point only the representation @xmath9 is excited ( appearing as high temperature fixed point in the statistical physics interpretation ) .",
    "another example are fixed points which can be understood as analogues of @xmath1 theories . in these cases the models can all be described by the haar projector and a choice of edge weights ( the analogues of spin foam face weights for the spin nets ) .",
    "furthermore we have to explain the notion of fine tuning , as this depends highly on the parametrization that one chooses for the initial models , which are then subjected to the coarse graining flow . to compare the parametrization",
    "( [ i8 ] ) introduced here and another parametrization used in @xcite let us explain the latter .",
    "it is based on so  called @xmath65functions , introduced in @xcite .",
    "these @xmath65functions encode the simplicity constraints .",
    "this parametrization covers all the standard models for spin foams @xcite . in this case",
    "the haar projector is replaced by operators of the form [ i9 ] p^(n)= p_haar e^_1e^_n p_haar where @xmath66 denotes a ( non  intertwining ) map : @xmath67 on a representation space associated to one of the faces adjacent to the edge in question .",
    "this gives another possibility to define consistently spin foam models for vertices or edges with arbitrary valency @xcite .",
    "however , for instance for the eprl model @xcite the projector property needs to be implemented by an additional construction @xcite , in which the factorizing structure of the operators ( [ i9 ] ) over the representation spaces @xmath68 is a priori changed .    indeed the form ( [ i9 ] )",
    "can be expanded in an intertwiner basis again [ i10 ] p^(n)= _ d , d |_d_d | p_haar e^_1e^_n p_haar |_d _",
    "d | where now in general non  diagonal terms proportional to @xmath69 appear .",
    "the question whether this is a projector turns then into the question whether a diagonaliztion leads to eigenvalues @xmath70 and @xmath59 only .",
    "@xcite used the @xmath65function parametrization for models based on the structure group @xmath71 .",
    "( the fusion categories of the permutation group @xmath71 and @xmath72 are actually gauge equivalent as fusion categories , hence we can compare the coarse graining results of @xcite with the examples considered here . ) a phase space diagram based on this parametrization leads to the following picture : basically all models given by this parametrization flow either to the high temperature phase or to a ` trivial ' @xmath71 or @xmath73 ordered phase , analogous to either @xmath1 theory on @xmath71 or @xmath1 theory on the subgroup @xmath73 for spin foams . only by fine tuning to a phase transition , in the case of @xcite between high temperature and @xmath71 ordered phase , one might flow to a non  trivial fixed point .",
    "it was this instance of a non  trivial fixed point , which motivated the investigations in @xcite , which revealed the possibility of a very rich structure of non  trivial fixed points in spin net models . however a posteriori it was rather a case of good fortune to have seen this fixed point at all , as it appeared ( a ) only for a tiny subset of initial models in the parametrization used , and ( b ) only for a certain truncation , as higher truncations turned on couplings that would lead to a flow away from this fixed point .",
    "the picture that we will find for the parametrization ( [ i8 ] ) introduced in this work will be very different .",
    "rather models flow generically to non  trivial fixed points .",
    "thus with the parametrization of the phase diagram here , the fixed points define a phase , i.e. an extended region in our phase diagram .",
    "we will work with quantum groups @xmath74 which makes a systematic investigation for different choices of @xmath7 possible ( bounded by the available computer power of course ) .",
    "this allows us to conjecture that the essential picture will not change in the limit @xmath8 and therefore holds for general ( quantum ) groups .",
    "these results give new weight to the point suggested in @xcite , which is to build models and select measure factors such that invariance under certain subdivisions of edges and faces is guaranteed .",
    "for edge subdivisions this leads to the projector property for the ` edge operators ' @xmath30 .",
    "the investigations here show that models which implement this property ( or are in a certain sense near such models ) flow rather to non  trivial fixed points . whereas for models of the form ( [ i9 ] ) the implementation of the projector property is rather involved @xcite and as @xcite shows for the structure group @xmath71 , most of these models flow to trivial fixed points .     + finally let us explain spin net models .",
    "very simply whereas for spin foams the @xmath75 are based on edges , for spin nets the @xmath75 are based on vertices and define the vertex weights .",
    "the edges are labelled by the representation labels @xmath19 , as well as two magnetic indices , labelling a basis in @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( the dual representation space ) respectively .",

    "this gluing of tetrahedra appears in stages :    * for the left and right copy separately ( i.e. for unprimed and primed spins ) we have the gluing of two tetrahedra to a double pyramid . here",

    "one will notice that @xmath224 corresponds to the indices of the new effective tensor , whereas the triangles in @xmath225 are glued with the appropriate @xmath226 and @xmath227 s from the singular value decomposition .",

    "note , that for some families of intertwiner fixed point models described in the next section [ results ] these amplitudes themselves are given by @xmath103 $ ] symbols .",

    "we can interpret this as a gluing of the two double pyramids via the triangle amplitudes , that depend on both primed and unprimed indices .",

    "this is invariant under changes of the triangulation , which will explain some of the occurring fixed points .",
    "this geometric interpretation might also help to approximate the coarse graining flow equation by a simpler equation .",
    "for instance it seems possible to consider instead of the flow equation related to the double pyramid a flow equation related to just one tetrahedron .",
    "this applies if @xmath228 in the sense explained below equation ( [ initt ] ) , which is preserved under coarse graining .",
    "preliminary numerical investigations have shown that this leads indeed to the same phase diagram as the more complicated flow equation .",
    "we will investigate this possibility further as it will allow us to consider more easily the replacement of the structure group @xmath4 with i.e.  @xmath6 , as appear for the 4d gravitational models .",
    "the space of possible tensors @xmath158 , and therefore spin net models is huge .",
    "one therefore needs to add further selection principles to arrive at a suitable phase space .",
    "for instance @xcite introduces and uses the so  called @xmath65function parametrization , which for the spin foams encompasses all current models .",
    "it also allows an interpretation as imposing simplicity constraints , which are encoded in the choice of the @xmath65function .",

    "symmetries , for instance under changing the recoupling scheme , via a 22 move .",

    "we will name this truncation ` one  singular  value per intertwiner channel algorithm ' . note that for @xmath263 , for which @xmath299 this already results in a necessary bond dimension of @xmath300 ( not even taken into account the large number of magnetic indices , that have been absorbed into the recoupling symbols appearing in the flow equation ( [ flow ] ) ) .",
    "thus such a truncation might be unavoidable if considering more complicated structure groups , i.e. @xmath6 .    by comparison , the full algorithm takes all singular values in all intertwiner channels and picks the largest @xmath301 ones , where @xmath301 is the fixed bond - dimension .",
    "thus it may happen that some intertwiner channels obtain multiplicity three , whereas others do not appear at all .    in what we have presented so far",

    "this confirms the ` one  singular  value per intertwiner channel ' truncation , and the conjecture that the intertwiner degrees of freedom are the relevant ones , i.e.  determine the large scale behaviour of the system .    as a next step it is worthwhile to study phase diagrams for these models and phase transitions between these new phases .",

    "we will make this picture more concrete , which will enable us to provide an interpretation of the coarse graining flow and the fixed points in terms of spin foams .",
    "let us consider a 3d spin foam defined on a cubical regular lattice .",
    "we will actually just need to consider ` one slice of cubes ' . in ( [ i3 ] )",
    "we gave the partition function of a general spin foam as [ sf1 ] z=_j_f _ f _ f(j_f ) _ e ( p^e)_m_f_1 m_f_2 m_f_3 m_f_4^n_f_1 n_f_2 n_f_3 n_f_4 where we already specialized to the case of four  valent edges . to obtain a spin net model we choose the edge intertwiners anisotropically .",
    "that is for the vertical edges we take the original @xmath320 of the spin foam model .",
    "however for the horizontal edges we replace the intertwining operators with @xmath321 . here we consider just a two  valent intertwining operator  this can be understood as imposing @xmath9 on all horizontal faces .",

    "to the vertical edges and @xmath323 s to the horizontal edges .",
    "these @xmath323 s contract the vertical projectors @xmath320 .",
    "[ sf - face],scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the contraction of indices among the vertical edge operators @xmath324 proceeds as indicated in figure [ sf - face ] . that is given a face @xmath325 the @xmath323 s from the horizontal edges",
    "contract the @xmath36 and @xmath106 indices of this face from the two vertical edge operators @xmath324 .",
    "hence we can replace the face by an edge with indices @xmath126 connecting now vertices , which represent the former edges .",
    "thus the spin net model is given by z_net=_j_e _ e _",
    "e(j_e ) _ v ( p^v)_m_e_1 m_e_2 m_e_3 m_e_4^n_e_1 n_e_2 n_e_3 n_e_4 , where the edge weights @xmath326 can be absorbed into the vertex weights @xmath327 .    in this sense",
    "we can understand a spin net as a spin foam with just two vertices and a very large number of faces , all of which have only two edges .",
    "all edges and faces share the same two vertices , which leads to a ( super ) melon in the sense of @xcite , see figure [ cubes ] .",
    "the fact that there are only two vertices explains why the local gauge symmetry of spin foams is converted into a global symmetry for the spin net .",
    "this is given by a left and right action of the group ( on the @xmath106 and on the @xmath36 indices ) corresponding to the two vertices .",
    "such melons play a crucial role in the investigation of coloured tensor models @xcite .",
    "note however that the renormalization flow considered here is quite different from the one usually considered ( which rather integrates out complete melons ) . in this work",
    "a ( super ) melon with many edges is coarse grained into another melon with fewer ( effective ) edges . for the spin net this corresponds to blocking a number of vertices into effective vertices .    , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=25.0% ] , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=25.0% ] , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=10.0% ]    we can therefore interpret spin net coarse graining as a highly anisotropic way of coarse graining ( anisotropic ) spin foams .",
    "( in this case the analogue @xmath1 phase is indeed the @xmath1 phase for spin foams . )",
    "it focusses on the change of coupling between two spin foam vertices with the coarse graining flow .",
    "following this interpretation , we see that the models that flow to factorizing fixed points lead in the spin foam interpretation to a factorization of vertex amplitudes .",
    "that is the contribution of the two vertices decouples into two parts associated to the upper and lower vertex of the super melon .",
    "that is gluing two spin foam vertices with many edges and blocking these into effective edges , we actually end up with two decoupled vertices , that is the melon is cut into two halves .",
    "the decoupling of vertices is certainly a possible scenario of spin foams , of course not a very attractive one",
    ". it will be interesting to see whether this also occurs for barrett  crane like models with @xmath328 structure group . for these models concerns",
    "have been voiced , that neighbouring tetrahedra are not sufficiently glued with each other , see the discussion in @xcite .    of course we can not be certain whether the corresponding spin foam models will really flow to the corresponding factorizing fixed points , as we are considering a very anisotropic situation . here",
    "an investigation at least into 3d spin foams seems to be in reach employing a coarse graining algorithm proposed in @xcite , which has been already tested for abelian models @xcite .",
    "alternatively it may be possible to devise a coarse graining scheme in which the coarse graining in equatorial direction of the melons , and integrating out entire melons , alternate .    from the spin foam point of view",
    "the ` mixed fixed points ' seems to be particular interesting and encouraging , as here the vertices do not decouple .",
    "it has to be investigated whether these ( spin net ) fixed points give also triangulation invariant spin foam models .",
    "such mixed fixed points seem to result from a subtle interplay between the two different sources of the spin foam models : on the one hand spin foams can be understood as generalized lattice gauge theories .",
    "however , as noticed in @xcite , the phases of standard lattice gauge theory seem to be dominating .",
    "the @xmath1 phase can be understood as leading to a maximal gluing between the ` two spin foam vertices ' in the spin net model .",
    "simplicity constraints indeed weaken this gluing ( alone by restricting the sum over intertwiner degrees of freedom ) and allow to flow out of the standard lattice gauge theory phases . however if this effect is too strong the two spin foam vertices ( in the spin net model ) decouple . in this sense",
    "the mixed fixed point represents a balance between these two effects .",
    "we think that it will be very worthwhile to push and test such an interpretation , as it could reveal the effect that the imposition of simplicity constraints has on the large scale limit of spin foams and in this way possibly resolve the question whether these have to imposed more strongly or not , see for instance @xcite .",
    "in this work we have taken several important steps towards a full understanding of the continuum limit of spin foam models .",
    "we in particular introduced and defined models based on the structure group @xmath4 that can encode the dynamics of the full gravitational models , but are still feasible to investigate numerically .",
    "note that apart from certain technical subtleties ( e.g. the definition of the duals ) for the quantum group coarse graining , that we resolved , this nevertheless requires very efficient numerical algorithms for @xmath263 .",
    "the tensors we are employing have five such indices , which run from @xmath59 to @xmath329 . thus already for saving these tensors one needs to employ an efficient scheme , not speaking off contracting indices of several such tensors .",
    "a technique we developed for this work are ` super indices ' which allow to save and deal only with entries not  vanishing as given by the coupling rules .",
    "this leads already to a huge reduction of components from @xmath330 to @xmath331 . ] . for this the symmetry",
    "protected tensor network algorithm developed here and in @xcite is absolutely crucial .",
    "we considered mainly spin nets , as dimensional reductions of spin foams , in this work .",
    "however , we point out that the spin net coarse graining flow is equivalent to a coarse graining flow of spin foam melons into spin foam melons .",
    "it particular focusses on the coupling of ( two ) spin foam vertices with each other  which is of course crucial to understand the macroscopic behaviour of spin foams .",
    "indeed it allows us to describe the properties of the fixed points found via coarse graining in terms of this coupling .",
    "note that this question can not even be considered if one performs coarse graining only by @xmath3 pachner moves @xcite .",
    "the coarse graining of the spin net models is encoded in a flow equation ( [ flow ] ) , which describes the behaviour of the intertwiner degrees of freedom .",
    "we believe that spin foam coarse graining ( including non  melonic spin foams of course ) will lead to quite similar coarse graining equations .",
    "thus one might speculate whether the phases we find are already the ones one will encounter for spin foam models .",
    "the coarse graining flow equation describes that the effective intertwiner degrees of freedom are obtained from the old intertwiner degrees of freedom basically by two operations : the first is a contraction of the tensors encoding the intertwiners , the second is a convolution with recoupling symbols .",
    "this convolution leads to a non  trivial flow of intertwiner degrees of freedom , i.e. intertwiner channels which are not excited initially , can become excited by the coarse graining flow .",
    "this is again not the case , if considering coarse graining via @xmath3 pachner moves only @xcite .    here",
    "again two effects seem to compete with each other : without simplicity constraints , i.e. models described by the haar intertwiner where we have a restriction to @xmath332 , the recoupling symbols appearing in the flow equation , contract with each other ( approximately ) to a kronecker delta . in this case one can indeed approximate the flow by a migdal kadanoff recursion @xcite , see also @xcite , where recoupling symbols do not appear .",
    "the flow is ( approximately ) restricted to the phase space where the spins of left and right copy agree , i.e. @xmath332 throughout the coarse graining . in the case of @xmath1 fixed points",
    "it leads to a gluing / coupling of the ( two ) spin foam vertices .",
    "this however only allows to reach the degenerate fixed point or a @xmath1 theory , either of the full structure group or of a normal subgroup ( in the case that one actually deals with a proper group ) .",
    "simplicity constraints , which lead to components with @xmath333 in the tensor @xmath165 , do change this picture in an essential way : now the convolution with the recoupling symbols appearing in the flow equation ( [ flow ] ) becomes crucial and leads to a large set of additional fixed points .",
    "indeed an open issue is the understanding of all possible fixed points , which might be possible with techniques developed in @xcite which allows already the understanding of all factorizing fixed points .",
    "as we have seen for a number of examples the flow can now lead to factorizing fixed points , where the copy labelled by @xmath79 indices and the copy labelled by @xmath220 indices decouple . in terms of ( melonic )",
    "spin foams this means a decoupling of the two spin foam vertices involved . for reasons discussed below",
    "it would be interesting to see whether such a decoupling appears in the barrett crane model @xcite with a quantum group @xcite .",
    "however we have also examples which flow to so  called mixed fixed points , in which both a coupling between the two spin foam vertices persists and nevertheless simplicity constraints persists",
    ". it will therefore be very interesting to investigate these fixed points further and in particular study whether these can be lifted to fixed points for ( non  melonic ) spin foam models .",
    "furthermore a full classification of these fixed points , along the lines of @xcite , would reveal further possible phases for spin nets and spin foams .",
    "both cases constitute non  trivial possible phases for spin nets and for spin foams ( at least the factorizing models lead to phases for spin foams as all vertices decouple ) . as discussed in section [ interpretation ] a decoupling of spin foam vertices",
    "might indeed be related to concerns that tetrahedra are not properly glued to each other , e.g.  in the barrett crane model @xcite .",
    "it would therefore help and potentially resolve the discussions on the correct way to impose simplicity constraints , to study coarse graining for other geometric configurations .",
    "starting from a coarse graining of melons , it might be possible to alternate the coarse graining considered here  in equatorial direction of the melon  with a coarse graining in vertical direction .",
    "this might already lead to a less anisotropic coarse graining , which takes also the blocking of spin foam vertices ( and not only edges as happens for the melonic flow considered here ) into account .",
    "apart from the identification of possible phases for spin foams we can draw another important lesson from the work here , in particular compared to @xcite .",
    "this is related to the introduction of a new parametrization of the space of models , based on reisenberger s construction principle and fixed point intertwiners @xcite .",
    "we have argued that this parametrization makes it much easier to satisfy the projector property , which guarantees invariance under edge subdivisions in spin foams .",
    "indeed the picture that this parametrization gives is quite different from the one based on @xmath65functions in @xcite , in which the projector property is quite complicated to implement @xcite .",
    "the parametrization in @xcite requires a fine tuning between the degenerate and @xmath1 phase , to flow to a non  trivial ( actually factorizing ) model .",
    "this is not the case for the fixed point intertwiner based parametrization , which leads to a rich spectrum of non  trivial fixed points , of both factorizing and non  factorizing type .",
    "we conjecture that this is due to the projector property , which itself can be interpreted as a very weak imposition of diffeomorphism symmetry @xcite .",
    "the fine tuning in @xcite can thus be understood as satisfying this weak requirement of diffeomorphism invariance , as already argued in @xcite .",
    "the results here therefore stresses the importance of this concept @xcite .",
    "interestingly the phase diagrams , obtained by considering linear combinations of fixed point intertwiners , support this conclusion even more . non ",
    "trivial fixed points appear in particular around the fixed point intertwiners itself . in the intermediate regions the models flow typically to the @xmath1 fixed point . although there seem to occur phase transition between non",
    " trivial phases , e.g. in figure [ fig : slice_phase20 ] , this might disappear if a higher accuracy is employed : it might happen , that all non  trivial phases are separated by models flowing to the @xmath1 fixed point .",
    "we leave the falsification or verification of this picture for future work .",
    "apart from the open questions mentioned so far there are numerous other directions for further work , some of which we outline here :    * given the results we have found here , i.e. that fixed point intertwiner models flow to interesting fixed points , it would be of high interest to classify such fixed points for intertwiner models , for @xmath6 , as is performed in @xcite for @xmath4 . the barrett ",
    "crane model constitutes one such fixed point , the question is , whether a barbero  immirzi parameter , as appearing in the eprl , fk and bo models @xcite can be accommodated by such a fixed point . * further approximations and therefore simplifications of the flow equation ( [ flow ] ) will be useful to allow the treatment of @xmath334 and similar structure groups .",
    "* coarse graining involving non  melonic spin foams should be developed along the lines of spin net coarse graining .",
    "as is discussed in @xcite the tensor network algorithm might be adaptable to the case of spin foams in a more straightforward way then envisaged in @xcite , which presented a tensor network formulation of spin foams .",
    "* it would be interesting to investigate in further detail the phase transitions .",
    "indeed one would expect that an interacting theory , such as 4d gravity , can only occur there . here",
    "the first question is , whether the models along the phase transition carry ` only ' conformal symmetry , or lead to a fully ( cylindrically ) consistent continuum limit as outlined in @xcite .",
    "as is argued in @xcite such a cylindrically consistent continuum limit is deeply entangled with the restoration of diffeomorphism symmetry , which is typically broken by the discretization itself @xcite . from a more tensor network renormalization point of view",
    "@xcite discusses the investigation of fixed point tensors at critical fixed points and the extraction of critical exponents .    in summary",
    ", we hope to have convinced the reader , that the tensor network coarse graining methods @xcite and the many refinements thereof developed here and in @xcite , together with the conceptual understanding of how to construct the continuum limit in @xcite , put the understanding of the possible phases of spin foam models within the very near future .",

    "<S> so far spin foam models are hardly understood beyond a few of their basic building blocks . to make progress on this question , we define analogue spin foam models , so called spin nets , for quantum groups @xmath0 and examine their effective continuum dynamics via tensor network renormalization . in the refinement limit of this coarse graining procedure , we find a vast non - trivial fixed point structure beyond the degenerate and the @xmath1 phase . in comparison to previous work , we use fixed point intertwiners , inspired by reisenberger s construction principle @xcite and the recent work @xcite , as the initial parametrization . in this new parametrization fine tuning </S>",
    "<S> is not required in order to flow to these new fixed points . </S>",
    "<S> encouragingly , each fixed point has an associated extended phase , which allows for the study of phase transitions in the future . </S>",
    "<S> finally we also present an interpretation of spin nets in terms of melonic spin foams . </S>",
    "<S> the coarse graining flow of spin nets can thus be interpreted as describing the effective coupling between two spin foam vertices or space time atoms . </S>"
