    "the determination of the lowest energy configuration of a vesicle is one of the most widely studied variational problems  @xcite .",
    "the vesicle is modeled as a closed two - dimensional surface in three dimensions with a given energy @xmath4 .",
    "the subscript @xmath5 denotes `` membrane '' , since in reality the surface of the vesicle is a membrane in the form of a lipid bilayer  @xcite .",
    "there are several different models which give different expressions for @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the earliest , and most widely studied , is the canham - helfrich - evans approach  @xcite , for which the energy is given by    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the mean curvature of the surface with area , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are constants : the so - called bending rigidity and spontaneous curvature respectively .",
    "the variational calculation might typically consist of finding the shape of the surface which minimizes @xmath4 for a given vesicle volume @xmath11 and surface area @xmath8 .",
    "the popularity of this approach to determining vesicle shape has much to do with the straightforward way it can be posed  not requiring any substantial input regarding vesicle structure or composition  and the richness of the possible shapes which are found @xcite .",
    "however these reasons are also partly responsible why the field has been slow to develop : going beyond this description is almost certainly going to involve more of the physics of vesicles and the resulting analysis may not be so elegant .",
    "one of the most obvious drawbacks of the variational studies is that they are static .",
    "they give us a snapshot of the shape of the vesicle , but do not tell us how the shape evolves with time , or the time taken for any new shape to come about .",
    "several dynamical studies of vesicles have already appeared in the literature  @xcite .",
    "while these preliminary investigations have proved useful in initiating research in this area , all have been deficient in some way or other .",
    "for instance , some of them are not truly dynamic , relying partially on the results of the static analysis  @xcite , while others assumed that vesicle shapes were restricted to spheres or axisymmetric ellipsoids  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we describe a systematic approach to analyzing the stability of growing vesicles .",
    "an obvious question is : what dynamics should be imposed on the system ?",
    "following previous treatments , the work presented here uses the formalism of linear nonequilibrium thermodynamics ( lnet ) .",
    "this assumes that that the vesicles are macroscopic  @xcite .",
    "this is reasonable given the size of vesicles , although it is clear that in some circumstances fluctuations will be important @xcite .",
    "however it should be noted that similar assumptions were made deriving the form of the energy ( [ eq : mem_ener ] ) ; it was based on an analogy between the rod - like lipids and nematic liquid crystals , using the methodology introduced by frank  @xcite as motivation .",
    "this is a macroscopic _ static _ description .",
    "the equivalent macroscopic _ dynamical _ description will involve nematohydrodynamics  @xcite . the approach taken here can therefore be seen as a natural extension of the static description which leads to ( [ eq : mem_ener ] ) .    unlike the static theory , it is necessary to postulate a mechanism which takes the system away from equilibrium , albeit slowly so that lnet holds .",
    "one mechanism could be temperature change , another could be the accretion of lipids onto the surface from the environment .",
    "we choose to model the latter mechanism , although we would expect that much of the formalism constructed will be more widely applicable .",
    "as will become apparent , this study is restricted in two ways .",
    "firstly , we concentrate on the stability of deformations ( as opposed to the full dynamics ) and secondly , for mathematical and presentational simplicity we focus on deformations which take a spherical vesicle to an arbitrary axisymmetric shape . the outline of the paper is therefore as follows : in section [ sec : thermodynamics ] the thermodynamics of a mixture of point - like constituents ( water ) and rod - like constituents ( lipids ) is reviewed with the aim of identifying the relevant forces and fluxes  and therefore constitutive relations  in a discontinuous lnet description of vesicle dynamics ; in section [ sec : diff_geo ] the formalism required to describe the change of shape of the vesicle , is outlined ; in section [ sec : stability ] these two aspects are brought together to provide a dynamical description of a vesicle growing due to accretion which is used to study the stability of a spherical vesicle to axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] with a review of the methodology of our approach and on the prospects for future work .",
    "there are three technical appendices one for each of sections [ sec : thermodynamics ] , [ sec : diff_geo ] , and [ sec : stability ] .",
    "in a previous study  @xcite which was restricted to deformations between spheres and ellipsoids , the thermodynamics of vesicle growth was presented in a straightforward but minimal way . here , the aim is to provide a more detailed account .",
    "some of the necessary theory  lnet , the rheology of nematics and the study of liquid crystals  is already present in the literature , though for clarity , certain parts are recapitulated ( in light of well - known texts ) whilst the details of specific calculations are provided in appendix [ app : discontinuous ] .",
    "the application of lnet to membrane systems has been studied previously @xcite , however the focus has been primarily on transport phenomena with the membrane treated as a single discontinuity separating two regions . in contrast , this paper is concerned with the membrane itself , and the deformations which occur during the process of growth due to accretion .",
    "it is assumed from the outset that the bilayer is closed ( _ i.e. _  a vesicle ) and that the surrounding solution is sufficiently dilute that lipids only attach to the surface of the existing bilayer ( and do not form other aggregates ) .",
    "references  @xcite have previously considered the aggregation of amphiphiles ( lipids ) for which the chemical potential of a given species is taken to be a function of the aggregation number , that is , the number of molecules of the same species in the local neighborhood .",
    "a similar mechanism is implicitly considered here by assuming that any molecular preference to be part of the bilayer , rather than part of the solution , is controlled by chemical potential gradients .",
    "the usual lnet approach @xcite is to consider a system sufficiently close to equilibrium that it can be divided into very small sub - systems which are effectively homogeneous . though small , these sub - systems are considered mesoscopic , that is , still large enough to define thermodynamic variables .",
    "it is then possible to choose a sufficiently large scale on which the variables that characterize each small sub - system form a continuous field .",
    "each sub - system , and so each point in space on the larger scale , is taken to obey the gibbs relation , which can be written in the general form    @xmath12    where all variables are now functions of position and time . here",
    ", @xmath13 is the temperature , @xmath14 is the pressure and following the literature we use @xmath15 , the specific entropy , given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the entropy and @xmath18 is the mass .",
    "similarly , @xmath19 is the specific internal energy , @xmath20 is the specific volume , and @xmath21 is the specific gibbs energy . the subscripted brackets , @xmath22 , are used to indicate that both temperature and pressure are held constant . traditionally , the rate of entropy production is then written as a sum of thermodynamic forces and fluxes which are related by constitutive equations .    for many lnet problems",
    "the relevant scale is such that the system effectively comprises a small number of uniform ( independent of position ) regions . in these cases , gradients of thermodynamic variables between regions",
    "are taken to be singular .",
    "for such _ discontinuous _",
    "@xcite systems , thermodynamic forces take the form of differences ( rather than gradients ) and thermodynamic fluxes become total flows between regions . in this",
    "paper vesicles are treated in such a way ; the membrane is taken to be a separate region of high lipid density  arranged in typical bilayer configuration  with discontinuous transitions to uniform dilute water - lipid solutions on either side .",
    "consider the isolated system described in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ; no external forces act , no chemical reactions may take place and temperature is taken to be constant throughout .",
    "the boundaries of each region are characterized by the outward normal , whereby all internal boundaries allow both heat and particle transfer but the external system boundary is adiabatic .",
    "pressure is assumed to be controlled by a piston , shown in gray , which allows heat but not particle transfer .",
    "choosing @xmath23 to label the separate regions of the system the total mass contained in a region is given by    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the partial mass density , @xmath26 is used to label the components ( lipid and water respectively ) and the integral is over volume @xmath11 of region @xmath27 . with this in place",
    "it is possible to introduce the total mass flux of a component out of a region    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the partial velocity of component @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the velocity of the boundary and @xmath32 is the area element ( aligned along the outward normal ) of the surface , @xmath33 , containing region @xmath27 . for external boundaries",
    "the usual `` no - slip '' condition applies : @xmath34 .",
    "however , in a departure from  @xcite , internal ( permeable ) boundaries are permitted to move .",
    "our approach is to consider a separation of timescales between the changes which occur to the membrane and the dynamics of the surrounding fluid .",
    "both the interior and exterior regions are assumed to equilibrate on a timescale much smaller than vesicle growth  that is , they are taken to be uniform .",
    "physically , such an assumption is plausible in the light of molecular simulations which indicate that the pressure difference between two regions separated by a bilayer are surprisingly large  @xcite .",
    "there are undoubtedly far from equilibrium regimes in which the vesicle is changing quickly enough for heterogeneous pressure differences to arise , but these situations are not considered in this paper . indeed , for the same reason we neglect any flow fields which could arise as a result of friction with the moving membrane . as a result of these assumptions , local mass fluxes at the boundary to both regions ( interior and exterior )",
    "are taken to be independent of position .",
    "by contrast , the membrane , however , is not uniform . as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] , molecules are assumed to be orientated in a bilayer fashion , so that for any shape other than a sphere , the local configuration of lipids ( e.g.  molecular splay ) has an angular dependence .",
    "we make the assumption that such differences do not mechanically affect the flow of mass , either water or lipids , into or out of the membrane . taking partial velocities to be in the direction of the outward normal , local mass fluxes , given by @xmath35",
    "are also assumed to be constant at the boundary to the membrane region .",
    "the relative configuration of lipids in the membrane is , however , still considered important thermodynamically . indeed , for such a simplified description of vesicles ",
    "with a uniform interior and exterior , driven by mass fluxes which do not vary at different points on the membrane ",
    "it seems reasonable to expect that any dynamical behavior ( or shape change ) will involve averaging some thermodynamic quantity over the membrane .",
    "for example , two vesicles of different shapes but equivalent _ average _ molecular splay are anticipated to undergo dynamics driven by the same total flows between interior , exterior and membrane regions . with this in mind ,",
    "confining the details to appendix [ app : discontinuous ] , we find that the total entropy produced in the system is given by    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the chemical potential of component @xmath30 and a bar above a variable denotes the average value taken over the _",
    "boundary _ to a region , in the sense that    @xmath38    for some thermodynamic variable @xmath39 .",
    "immediately it is clear that @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "( the average over the boundary to region ii is addressed below ) .",
    "it should be noted that in order to reach the result ( [ eq : sigma_tot_main ] ) , one important assumption has been made : that the entropy produced due to the re - alignment of molecules as the vesicle grows can be neglected .",
    "this is plausible in the context of a stability analysis of deformations ; any such entropy produced as a result of a small perturbation in the shape is proportional to thermodynamic forces ( such as pressure and chemical potential gradients ) _ within _ the membrane .",
    "these gradients are considered negligible on the scale of pressure / chemical potential differences _ across _ the membrane .",
    "one might now ask : what role is played by the energy which arises from lipid interactions in the membrane ? in order to answer this , we suppose that the internal energy averaged over the boundary to region ii ( the membrane ) is well defined thermodynamically , in the sense that @xmath42 . here , @xmath43 , @xmath15 and @xmath44 , are defined earlier , @xmath45 is the concentration ( of component @xmath30 ) and @xmath46 is introduced as a specific extensive variable characterizing orientation dependent  in this case , amphiphilic  interactions .",
    "dropping superscripts for simplicity , this implies    @xmath47    where @xmath37 is the chemical potential of component @xmath30 and    @xmath48    note that for this system @xmath49 and @xmath50 . assuming that the average specific internal energy is homogeneous and of first order in the masses of each component implies that the average specific gibbs energy may be written as    @xmath51    that is , a sum of the usual free energy of a system of point - like constituents  arising due to the concentrations of components  and another term relating to the nematic nature of the molecules . as previously mentioned , we use the simplest macroscopic model of energy associated with the orientation of lipids in a bilayer : that attributed to canham , evans and helfrich . indeed , ignoring concentration dependent terms ( and re - introducing superscripts for clarity ) , comparison with ( [ eq : mem_ener ] ) leads to the following identifications    @xmath52    as @xmath9 does not scale with the system size ( _ i.e. _  it is intensive ) . in the above the membrane is taken to be of constant thickness @xmath3 , where the factor preceding the integral comes from the fact that the canham - helfrich - evans model is an integral over energy _ per unit area _ @xcite .",
    "note also that the factor of @xmath18 comes from the fact that @xmath53 is a specific , or per unit mass , quantity . here , in order to be consistent with membrane model literature ( see for example the early sections of @xcite or @xcite ) , the previously defined `` bar averaging '' taken over the boundary to the membrane has been replaced by an average over a surface bisecting the two layers of lipids , @xmath54 , the so - called neutral surface  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this approach is extended to all thermodynamic variables : an average taken over the exterior of the membrane is the same as an average taken over the neutral surface .    with this in place",
    ", it is now possible to examine how the chemical potential in ( [ eq : sigma_tot_main ] ) depends on the other thermodynamic variables . assuming the form @xmath55 we see that    @xmath56    where temperature has been held constant and partial specific quantities @xmath57 and @xmath58 are defined in the following way    @xmath59    @xmath60    for a discontinuous system such as ours",
    "it is useful to first define the difference notation ( for some thermodynamic variable @xmath39 )    @xmath61    once again following @xcite it is now possible to write an equivalent expression to ( [ eq : dmu_k ] ) for small finite differences between regions :    @xmath62    restating ( [ eq : sigma_tot_main ] ) using the above difference notation and then substituting for ( [ eq : deltamu_k ] ) it can be seen that , for small deformations , the rate of entropy produced will have contributions from pressure differences , energy differences due to membrane deformation and chemical potential differences . the resultant expression may then be simplified by applying a number of assumptions which are valid for the type of vesicle system discussed here .",
    "firstly , the mass of lipids accreting to the membrane from the interior is negligible .",
    "that is , in contrast to the exterior , the interior is not treated as a reservoir .",
    "secondly , the membrane thickness , @xmath3 , is considered small on the scale of the system .",
    "this permits us to write the volume of the membrane , to first order in small parameter @xmath3 , as the area of the surface which bisects the membrane multiplied by the thickness ( i.e.  @xmath63 ) .",
    "finally , we assume that both @xmath9 , the bending rigidity , and @xmath10 the spontaneous curvature , remain constant .",
    "for such a case , the average density of lipids in the membrane and the average ratio of lipids between the inner and outer layers must be unchanged .",
    "therefore each new unit of mass added to the membrane is assumed to increase the area of the surface which bisects the membrane by a constant factor .",
    "the manipulations are left to appendix [ app : discontinuous ] , where it is shown that    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the surface tension . here the alternative convention of using @xmath65 is adopted as @xmath66 represents the rate of entropy production . ] and @xmath67 is the pressure difference between the exterior and interior . here , surface area @xmath8 , volume enclosed @xmath11 and bending energy @xmath4 are defined in relation to a single mathematical surface taken to bisect the two lipid monolayers .",
    "it is worthwhile noting here that @xmath65 corresponds to the `` interfacial free energy '' in the sense defined in  @xcite .",
    "that is , the change in free energy which results from increasing ( decreasing ) the surface by adding ( removing ) molecules at constant density_cf_.  eq .",
    "( [ eq : dm_dt = ada_dt ] ) .",
    "this contrasts with increasing the surface area by reducing the density of a fixed number of molecules : the resultant change in free energy from such an approach is referred to as the `` elastic free energy '' . here , as with the majority of studies to date ,",
    "the effects of elastic free energy are neglected and the lipid bilayer is assumed to be effectively incompressible due to the separation of energy scales between stretching and bending energies  @xcite . as pointed out in  @xcite , thermal fluctuations",
    "are thought to be more important to studies of elastic free energy rather than the interfacial energy considered here .",
    "the result ( [ eq : sigma_tot_no_superscripts ] ) allows us to identify the forces and fluxes for this nonequilibrium system , and this is discussed further in section [ effective_pressure_and_surface_tension ] . in our previous work",
    "@xcite these were identified largely through physical arguments and from the work of kedem and katchalsky @xcite .",
    "we did use simple thermodynamic relations , but only to show that the term involving the membrane energy could be absorbed into effective forces  an analysis which is recapitulated in section [ effective_pressure_and_surface_tension ] . the thermodynamic analysis is this paper is far more extensive , and as such is not easy to compare with that presented in @xcite .",
    "this is especially true of the identification of the various contributions to the entropy .",
    "in @xcite we considered a fluid separated into two homogeneous regions and wrote down the sum of entropy changes associated with each region .",
    "however , here we consider the membrane as a separate region . with proper consideration given to conservation laws , such a sum is equal in size but opposite in sign to the entropy produced by the system .",
    "as long as care is taken to give the correct interpretation to the various contributions , both treatments agree , but with the present paper giving a mathematical justification to the form of the dynamical equations used in @xcite that was not present in that previous discussion .",
    "this paper examines the stability of deformations away from a sphere _",
    "i.e. _  does a deformation grow or decay ? in this context it is possible to simplify ( [ eq : sigma_tot_no_superscripts ] ) by appealing once again to the rationale used earlier when neglecting the entropy contributions from molecular re - alignments within the membrane .",
    "it is assumed that the rate of change in energy due to small membrane deformations is a function of only two time - dependent variables : the surface area and volume of the membrane .",
    "that is , on small timescales , changes in the energy of the membrane are dominated by the addition of lipids to the surface or by changes in the pressure difference across the membrane .",
    "this point will be re - examined in more detail in section [ sec : diff_geo ] . for now , taking @xmath68 the rate of entropy production can be written in terms of an _ effective _ pressure difference and _ effective _ surface tension . that is    @xmath69    which implies    @xmath70    where    @xmath71    and    @xmath72    equation  ( [ eq : sigma_tot_eff ] ) identifies the rate of entropy production for a growing vesicle as a sum of two pairs of forces and fluxes : the flow of volume into the vesicle , coupled to a modified pressure difference across the membrane ; and the rate of area increase of the membrane ( due to accretion of lipids ) which is coupled to an modified surface tension .",
    "finally , the usual linear constitutive relation between the fluxes and forces may be invoked . making contact with @xcite the volume flux",
    "is written as    @xmath73    where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are onsager coefficients defined `` per unit area '' following the convention of the initial papers detailing the theory of hydraulic conductivity @xcite .    in summary , we have shown how the growth of vesicles can be described thermodynamically , and reduced it under given conditions to the study of two - dimensional surfaces whose volume changes according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : constitutive ] ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is devoted to analyzing the growth such surfaces , and especially to their deviations from a spherical shape .",
    "in this section , the formalism needed to describe surface deformations is outlined .",
    "the aspects of differential geometry required are given in many standard textbooks ( e.g.  @xcite ) , but fortunately they are also used ( in part ) for the variational treatments which have been so prevalent in previous studies of vesicle behavior .",
    "the book by ou - yang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite gives a good account of the details and the reader is referred to it for a discussion of the mathematical background . for this reason , @xcite forms the basis of the notation used below .",

    "such axisymmetric vesicles have been the some of the most studied in variational calculations .",

    "it is assumed that as lipids are incorporated into the membrane , the entropy produced  due to the realignments of others  can be neglected .",

    "the energy is assumed to rely on two time - dependent variables : surface area @xmath252 and volume enclosed @xmath253 . here , in analogy to a standard two - component system partitioned into two regions , the entropy produced is characterized by an effective pressure difference and effective surface tension .",
    "the effective pressure is just the normal pressure difference modified by the term @xmath254 , and the effective surface tension is the normal surface tension modified by the term @xmath255 .    whilst undoubtedly such a thermodynamic approach can be improved upon , the nature of the approximations made",

    "at the very least , the nature and extent of the assumptions are clearly visible providing a starting point for attempts to relax them .    with the study reduced to the dynamics of a surface of area @xmath252 enclosing a volume @xmath253 and characterized by an energy @xmath256given by ( [ eq : mem_ener])the problem is geometrical in nature and differential geometry may be used .",
    "in general the approach is applicable to any smooth surface with no particular symmetry properties , but the analysis that we present in section [ sec : diff_geo ] is restricted to an axisymmetric surface . the reasons for making this choice are two - fold : it is common in variational studies of vesicle growth , and , for reasons of simplicity .",
    "however there is no problem in principle in treating a general shape .",
    "the main difference is that the perturbation would depend on the angle @xmath95 as well as @xmath94 , and would be spanned by the full set of spherical harmonics @xmath257 .",

    "a peculiarity of the perturbation expansion which has already been remarked on in @xcite is that it is necessary to develop the perturbation expansion to third order in order to find the growth rate of @xmath147 to leading order .",
    "this unfortunately makes the calculation more complicated than might have naively been expected",
    ". nevertheless , the present analysis places no constraint on the nature of the perturbation , other than it is axisymmetric .",
    "this is in contrast to our earlier treatment @xcite , which assumed that the distorted surface was an ellipsoid .",
    "the results of the present treatment are shown to reduce to those of @xcite for the case where the perturbation corresponds to the @xmath223 zonal harmonic .    in general it",
    "is found that there are two critical radii at which changes in stability occur .",
    "however , in the case when perturbations take the form of a single zonal harmonic , only one of these radii is physical : that given by @xmath259 , where @xmath1 is the hydraulic conductivity and @xmath2 the onsager coefficient corresponding to changes in surface area due to lipid accretion . in order to quantify our results we made an estimate for @xmath2 using simple physical arguments",
    "for a more complete approach this phenomenological coefficient would need to be measured experimentally .",

    "there are many ways in which the analysis presented here could be taken forward .",

    "a summary of some relevant experimental studies was given in @xcite ; of particular interest is @xcite , where initially symmetric vesicles were found to deform into oblate shapes and then prolate ones under osmotic pressure changes which serve to reduce the enclosed volume .    in relation to these existing experimental studies ,",
    "it is appropriate to scrutinize our choice of driving mechanism . here",
    ", we assumed that lipids accrete to the surface at a constant rate per unit area .",
    "although this leads to a growth law of exponential form ( [ eq : growth ] ) , it is worth highlighting that @xmath151 is taken to be very small ( of the order @xmath260",
    "@xcite ) . that is , for the range of observed vesicle sizes",
    ", surface growth will still be very slow .",
    "our choice of mechanism was influenced by a number of factors .",
    "firstly , experiments of this type have been carried out and are documented in  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the suggestion is that growth due to accretion is a plausible phenomenon in the pre - biotic scenario in which we are interested .",
    "secondly , this approach already entails a great deal of mathematics ; we therefore wanted to implement the simplest choice for driving the system away from equilibrium",
    ". however , growth laws of a more complicated form could be incorporated if necessary . finally , we were also conscious to demonstrate that both the results presented here and the extended theoretical background detailed in section  [ sec : thermodynamics ] are connected to our previous paper  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in reality , lipids in solution are likely to form micelles and small vesicles .",
    "however , the additional effects of such micelle - vesicle or vesicle - vesicle adsorption are not considered here . with these points in mind , a more experimentally accessible approach might be to extend previous work so that temperature change  rather than the accretion of lipids  is the effect which gives rise to shape changes .",
    "however , the analysis needed to incorporate such a feature presents a further technical challenge and , in light of the already lengthy theoretical background , it is left for future work .    in addition to the above , it is clear from experiment that non - axisymmetric vesicles are observed ( see for example  @xcite ) and so our analysis should be extended to investigate transitions from a sphere to an arbitrary shape , as opposed to those invariant about the @xmath104-axis . similarly , a more general theory based on deformations from an arbitrary shape ( as opposed to a sphere ) could also be developed .",
    "lastly , more realistic models of the membrane such as the area - difference elasticity model @xcite could be used .",
    "all these studies would benefit from more experimental input .",
    "however , the foundations we have laid , and the methods we have developed in this paper , do allow for these more general analyzes to be carried out .",

    "combining this with ( [ eq : nu^2_k_dm^2_k_dt ] ) the first term of ( [ eq : sigma_tot_4 ] ) becomes    @xmath285    turning attention to the second term of ( [ eq : sigma_tot_4 ] ) , we notice that since interactions between lipids are neglected outside the membrane we are free to set @xmath286 in all other regions , therefore only values of the summand for @xmath287 need be considered . in a similar fashion to above , remembering that @xmath288 , we see that    @xmath289    here , in analogy to above , we recognize the right - hand side as @xmath290 , where the second term arises due to the fact that @xmath53 is not conserved : the curvature of the membrane can change spontaneously through the exchange of lipids between outer and inner monolayers . finally , assuming that the membrane thickness @xmath3 is small on the scale of the vesicle we may write    @xmath291    where , following from identifications ( [ eq : mu_gamma_and_gamma ] ) the second term of ( [ eq : sigma_tot_4 ] ) may finally be written as    @xmath292    in analogy to the gibbs - duhem relation derived in appendix ii of @xcite , the third term of ( [ eq : sigma_tot_4 ] ) may be simplified by writing    @xmath293    from which it can be seen that in the limit of dilute solutions , @xmath294    @xmath295    furthermore assuming that the interior of the vesicle only contributes a negligible flow of lipids  that is , it is not considered a reservoir  gives    @xmath296    combining the results ( [ eq : first_term ] ) , ( [ eq : second_term ] ) and ( [ eq : dm_l^iii_dt=0 ] ) it is now possible to write ( [ eq : sigma_tot_4 ] ) as    @xmath297    this expression can be further simplified by once again taking the membrane to be of constant thickness , @xmath3very small on the scale of the vesicle  so that    @xmath298    and    @xmath299    where @xmath54 and @xmath300 are the area of , and volume enclosed by , the surface which bisects the membrane .",
    "finally , as @xmath9 and @xmath10 are taken to remain constant , it is assumed that , on average , every unit of mass ( of lipids ) accreted into the bilayer increases the area of the central bisecting surface by the same factor , that is    @xmath301    where @xmath302 is a constant .",
    "this is in - line with the usual assumption that bilayers are essentially incompressible due to the separation of energy scales between stretching and bending energies  @xcite .",
    "however , it is necessary to acknowledge that in certain circumstances ( e.g.  highly compressed bilayers ) thermal fluctuations are important  @xcite . applying the results , ( [ eq : dv2_dt = lda_dt ] ) , ( [ eq : dv3_dt = lda_dt ] ) and ( [ eq : dm_dt = ada_dt ] ) to ( [ eq : sigma_tot_5 ] ) gives    @xmath303    where    @xmath304",
