    "@xmath10 defined by @xmath11 for all @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "even though cellular automata have been introduced by j. von neumann  @xcite , the impulsion for their systematic study was given by the work of s. wolfram  @xcite .",
    "he instigated a systematic study of _ elementary _ cellular automata , which are the cellular automata defined on the alphabet @xmath14 with radius @xmath15 ( there are @xmath16 such cellular automata and each of them is associated a number @xmath17 ) .",
    "in particular he proposed a classification according to the observation of the space - time diagrams produced by the time evolution of cellular automata starting from a random configuration .",
    "one of these classes corresponds to a particular form of self - organisation : from a random configuration , after a short transitional regime , regions consisting in a simple repeated pattern emerge and grow in size , while the boundaries between them persist under the action of the cellular automaton and can be followed from an instant to the next .",
    "therefore their movement ( time evolution ) can be defined inductively , and in this case we call these boundaries particles . in the simplest case ,",
    "these particles evolve at constant speed and are annihilated when colliding with other particles ; however , they can sometimes exhibit a periodic behavior or even perform a random walk , and the collisions may give birth to new particles following some more or less complicated rules .",
    "this type of behavior was first observed empirically in elementary cellular automata # 18 , # 122 , # 126 , # 146 , and # 182 @xcite , then # 54 , # 62 , # 184 @xcite , etc .",
    "the interest for these automata stems from their dynamics that appeared neither too simple nor too chaotic , giving hope to better understand their underlying structure . in figure",
    "[ fig : particles ] , we show the space - time diagrams of a sample of such automata iterated on a ( uniform ) random configuration .    roughly speaking , studying particles in cellular automata requires two steps :    * identifying and describing the particles , usually as finite words ; * describing the particle dynamics and understanding its effect on the properties of the ca .    historically , this study was often performed on individual or small groups of similar - looking ca , and the first step was done in a case - by - case manner .",
    "see for example @xcite for the 3-state cyclic automaton , @xcite for rule @xmath18 and other automata with similar dynamics , @xcite for rule @xmath19  other works such as @xcite skip the first step and study particle dynamics in an abstract manner instead , deducing dynamical properties of automata by making assumptions on the dynamics of their particles ( althought examples of such particles are provided ) .",
    "the first general formalism of particles in cellular automata was introduced by m. pivato : homogeneous regions are correspond to words from a subshift @xmath20 and particles are defects in a configuration of @xmath20 .",
    "he developed some invariants to characterise the persistence of a defect  @xcite and he described the different possible dynamics of propagation of a defect  @xcite .    in the present work we focus on the second step first .",
    "more precisely , we are interested in how the existence of some particle set with good dynamical properties affects the typical asymptotic behavior",
    ". then we apply this general framework to a variety of examples , finding the sets of particles by pivato s methods or otherwise , to explain the self - organisation that is observed experimentally .",
    "let us define more formally what we mean by typical asymptotic behavior .",
    "starting from a @xmath0-invariant measure @xmath21 ( i.e. @xmath22 for all borelian set @xmath23 ) , we consider the iteration of a cellular automata @xmath24 on this measure : @xmath25    we then study the asymptotic properties of the sequence @xmath26 , and particularly the set of cluster points called the limit measure(s ) . sometimes our information on the @xmath1-limit set , which is the union of the supports of all limit measures .",
    "equivalently , it is the set of configurations containing only patterns whose probability to appear in the space - time diagram does not tend to zero as time tends to infinity .",
    "this set introduced in  @xcite corresponds to the configurations which are observed asymptotically when the automaton is iterated on a random configuration .",
    "when studying typical asymptotic behaviour in this sense , it is unreasonable to except a general result since a wide variety of limit measures can be reached in the general case  @xcite and any nontrivial property of the @xmath1-limit set is undecidable @xcite .",
    "that is why we consider restricted cases for the dynamics of the particles . to determine the @xmath1-limit set in some cases ,",
    "p. krka suggests an approach based on particle weight function which assigns weights to certain words  @xcite .",
    "however , this method does not cover any case when a defect can remain in the @xmath1-limit set .",
    "hence we aim at a more general approach , in terms of particle dynamics as well as initial measures .",
    "one of our main motivations for this study is the class of captive cellular automata , where the local rule can not make a colour appear if it is not already present in the neighbourhood .",
    "these automata were introduced by g. theyssier in @xcite for their algebraic properties , but he also noticed an interesting phenomenon : when drawing a captive cellular automaton at random ( fixed alphabet and neighbourhood ) , most captive automata exhibited the type of behavior we described above .",
    "any kind of general result regarding self - organisation of captive cellular automata remains a challenging open problem .",
    "this article is divided into two main sections , corresponding to improved versions of results previously published in conferences  @xcite . in section  [ sec : particles ] , we present a qualitative result generalised from  @xcite with an improved formalism , shorter proofs and a new application to probabilist cellular automata ( section  [ sec : probabilist ] )",
    ". then , in section  [ sec : brown ] , we refine our approach on a subclass to obtain some quantitative results .",
    "sections  [ sec : walks ] to [ sec : brownian ] were published in @xcite ; we correct some inaccuracies in the proofs and extend the study to other parameters .",

    "assuming particles have good collision properties ( coalescence ) , only particles moving in one particular direction can persist aymptotically .",
    "we introduce our own formalism of particle system in section  [ sec : particlesdef ] so as to be able to describe the dynamics of the particles , and section  [ sec : selforg ] is dedicated to the proof itself .",
    "section  [ sec : defects ] present a simplified version of pivato s formalism which is by far the simplest way to find such a particle system in most examples .",
    "we spend section  [ sec : particlesexamples ] on various examples of automata where this result can be applied :    section  [ section.184 ] : :    we characterize the @xmath1-limit set of the `` traffic ''    automaton ( rule @xmath18 ) , a simple case that may clarify    the formalism .",
    "the results were known for initial bernoulli    measures  @xcite but our method applies for every    @xmath0-ergodic measure ; section  [ section.cyclic ] : :    we consider the family of @xmath27-cyclic cellular automata    introduced in  @xcite . using our method , we go further in the    study of these simple automata : in particular , for @xmath28    or @xmath3 , we show that the limit measure is unique and is a    convex combination of dirac measures supported by uniform    configurations . section  [ section.captive ] : :    we characterize the @xmath1-limit set of all one - sided    captive cellular automata .",
    "this is a first step to the study of    asymptotic behaviour of captive cellular automata .",
    "section  [ section.randomwalk ] : :    last , we apply our formalism to a cellular automaton where the    particules do not have a linear speed but instead perform random walks    by drawing randomness from the initial measure",
    ".    however , our results are not general enough to apply to defects of a sofic subshift that can have a particle - like behavior , such as in rule @xmath19 ( see the bottom right picture in figure  [ fig : particles ] and @xcite ) , or to more complicated particle systems such as those observed in general captive cellular automata .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : probabilist ] , we generalize our method to probabilistic cellular automata . as an application",
    ", we partially describe limit measures of the probabilistic cellular automata proposed by n. fats in @xcite as a candidate to solve the density classification problem .",
    "another application proposed in section  [ section.regnault-remilia-line ] present a generalization to the infinite line of a self stabilization process toward a discrete line proposed in  @xcite .",

    "this research direction was inspired by @xcite , where the authors consider the waiting time before a particle crosses the central column ( called entry time ) .",
    "using the same approach as in @xcite , we show that the behavior of these automata can be described by a random walk process ( section  [ sec : walks ] ) , and we approximate this process by a brownian motion using scale invariance ( section  [ sec : brownian ] ) .",
    "thanks to this tool , we answer negatively a conjecture proposed in  @xcite by determining the correct asymptotic law for the entry time of a particle in the central column ( section  [ sec : entry ] ) .",
    "we then use the same approach on various natural parameters such as the density of particles at time @xmath29 ( section  [ sec : density ] ) or the rate of convergence to the limit measure ( section  [ sec : rate ] ) .",
    "this generalises some known results on initial bernoulli measures from @xcite and @xcite , in particular relaxing the conditions on the initial measures . in section  [ sec : extensions ] , we exhibit various examples with similar dynamics on which these results apply .    in all the article",
