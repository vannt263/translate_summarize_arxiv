    "the observed correlation between stellar mass and star formation rate ( sfr ) in galaxies as a function of redshift provides insight into the integrated sfr over the history of the universe ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "several independent observations now suggest that the sfr in galaxies is regulated and in some cases quenched by different physical processes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one of the fundamental questions is whether these processes are more closely correlated with internal galaxy properties ( such as mass and luminosity ) or with their external environment .",
    "in particular , many studies have shown that the sfr in individual galaxies is affected by environment . in the local universe",
    ", it is well established that the fraction of passive ( red ) galaxies is higher in regions of high galaxy density , while regions of low galaxy density harbor predominantly blue , star forming galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this may suggest that any environmental influence responsible for quenching sfr must operate on a short time scale of few gyrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the contribution of galaxies to @xmath9 depends on their stellar mass , with massive galaxies at higher - redshifts contributing a greater total @xmath9 than similar mass galaxies today .",

    "* ) , and zcosmos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have confirmed that stellar mass plays a fundamental role in determining the fate of a galaxy .    with large , spectroscopic surveys ,",
    "several of these studies have begun to explore the effect of environment over a wide range of redshifts , and they generally find that environment is a second - order effect compared with the mass - driven evolution .",
    "@xcite has proposed a particularly interesting , empirical model in which environment induces transformation from active to passive , at a rate that is surprisingly independent of stellar mass .    since",
    "environmental influences might be expected to have the largest effect on gas - rich , low - mass galaxies , the relevant physics may thus best be probed by studying such galaxies at @xmath12 or higher .",
    "this is a particularly interesting epoch , as there is mounting evidence that star formation may actually be _ enhanced _ in gas  rich galaxies that live in dense regions at these redshifts , although the fraction of red ( passively  evolving ) galaxies still increases with density ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , most of the results cited above are based on flux - limited surveys , and hence can only spectroscopically probe the high - mass regime ( @xmath13 ) at @xmath7 . for a complete picture it is necessary to probe sfr in low - mass galaxies as well .",
    "we have therefore carried out a spectroscopic survey , the ` redshift one ldss3 emission line survey ' ( roles ) , to study the dependence of @xmath9 on stellar mass at @xmath10 .",
    "our observations focus on low - mass galaxies ( 8.5@xmath14log(@xmath15)@xmath1410 ) , @xmath1610 times less massive than those typically considered in the current literature .",
    "we aim to obtain a sample complete in both sfr and stellar mass .",
    "the first two papers of this series , @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter paper i and paper ii ) , revealed that the @xmath9 does not increase continuously with decreasing stellar mass , but instead exhibits a ` turn - over ' at @xmath17 just as it does in the local universe .",
    "this demonstrates that low mass galaxies do not dominate the total sfr density at any epoch @xmath18 . comparing the results with those derived from sdss galaxies at @xmath11 using an identical [ oii ] calibration",
    ", paper ii finds that the shape of the total sfr density as a function of stellar mass remains similar at @xmath10 and @xmath11 , although the magnitude of the total sfr density becomes smaller at @xmath11 .",
    "this implies that the rate at which the sfr density decreases is not a strong function of stellar mass . in other words ,",
    "the evolution of global @xmath9 is better described as a simple evolution of the normalization of @xmath19 , and the shape and relative contributions of galaxies of different masses remained unchanged .    in this paper",

    "we use a red blazed 300 l / mm grism with an average dispersion of @xmath162.7  per pixel .",
    "our custom kg750 filter has a 7040 - 8010  bandpass , and hence allows us to observe [ oii]@xmath243727 over @xmath26=0.889 - 1.149 .",
    "the 8 arcmin ldss3 field of view typically allows us to allocate almost @xmath27 non - overlapping 3 arcsec long slits in this configuration using nod & shuffle mode .",
    "we observed six masks in each of three pointings ; two within the goods - cdfs , and a third in the fires ms1054 field .",
    "these fields were chosen because they have very deep @xmath28band data and publicly available photometric - redshift catalogues .",
    "our goods - cdfs parent catalog was kindly provided by @xcite , and the ms1054 catalog was obtained from the fires team @xcite .",
    "we prioritized galaxies with photometric - redshifts which indicate the greatest probability that the [ oii ] line lies in our redshift range , a full discussion of the selection and completeness can be found in paper ii , and we revisit the completeness for our purposes in section  [ weight ] .    following paper  ii , we select emission line objects with greater than 4@xmath29 significance , and with a high likelihood that the line is [ oii ] rather than something else , based on the photometric redshift probability .",
    "this leaves us with 311 [ oii ] galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from the cdfs and fires patches .",
    "although both fields are statistically equivalent , the smaller fires field only contributes 75 galaxies to the whole sample .",
    "moreover , our analysis will need to combine our spectroscopic sample with the publicly available cdfs redshift data for brighter , higher mass galaxies to allow us to accurately measure local environment .",

    "since our main purpose is to compare galaxies of fixed stellar mass , in different environments , our main results are insensitive to this assumption .",

    "we refer to this combined spectroscopic catalog in the cdfs field ( ldss3+fors2+fireworks ) as ` roles ' and those emission galaxies obtained in our own ldss3 survey as ` ldss3 ' galaxies .",

    "for the few galaxies in our roles catalogue that do not have fireworks redshifts , we use the photo - z from which our survey was initially selected , @xcite , as described in paper  ii .",
    "since the photo - z are important for our completeness estimates , it is useful to check these using an independent method . therefore , we derive our own independent photo - z .",

    "these new photo - z are calculated using an empirical fitting method modified from @xcite .",
    "this requires a training set , which we construct using the full spectroscopic catalogue in the cdfs field , including our ldss3 targets .",
    "we modify the method of @xcite so that , instead of using 19 fixed magnitude - color cells to derive the fitting solutions , we do the fit using a subset of training - set galaxies which are chosen to have magnitudes and colors closest to a galaxy for which we wish to measure a photo - z .",
    "this reduces the bias in the fitting solutions when a galaxy is located near the edge of a color - magnitude cell . during the fitting process",
    ", a weight based on the rank of the quadratic sum of magnitudes and colors to the input galaxy is assigned to each training set galaxy in the same dynamical magnitude - color subset ; i.e. , the training - set galaxies with magnitudes and colors more similar to the input galaxies contribute more weight .",
    "the photo - z pdf and hence uncertainty for each galaxy is computed by simulating galaxy photometry uncertainties with gaussian distributions , and bootstrapping the training - set galaxies in a magnitude - color cell .",

    "all the science analyses in this paper have been done using both the public fireworks and our empirical photo - z .",
    "we find that the main difference is in the completeness measures ( see  [ weight ] ) , but our conclusions are insensitive to which set is used .",
    "following paper ii , we derive _ a posteriori _ completeness corrections for our sample selection strategy , using the photo - z probability distribution function ( pdf ) of each galaxy .",
    "if a galaxy has a reliable spectroscopic redshift , we replace its photo - z pdf with a @xmath39-function located at the spectroscopic redshift .",
    "since the public data compiled by fireworks provide us with redshifts but not sfr , we must define two completeness corrections : @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "the sfr completeness @xmath41 is computed in bins of @xmath42 magnitude , with a binsize @xmath43=0.25 as , @xmath44    the denominator is the sum of the photo - z pdf of all the galaxies in a k magnitude bin over our redshift range @xmath31 .",
    "the numerator is computed as the sum of the photo - z pdf over the same redshift range for the galaxies in the same @xmath42 magnitude bin but with slits allocated from either our ldss3 data or the fors2 catalogue .",
    "this implicitly assumes that redshifts are successfully obtained for every targeted galaxy that has significant sfr and lies within the specified redshift range .",
    "this is likely a good approximation for our faint , ldss3 sample ( see below ) .",
    "although the redshift success of the fors2 spectroscopy is only about 70 per cent , we assume here that redshift failures are either absorption  line galaxies , or galaxies with @xmath45 , for which the [ oii ] line would not be accessible . a plot of @xmath46 as a function of magnitude",

    "this @xmath46 is analogous to what paper ii terms ` @xmath49 ' , which was used to calculate sfr densities ( equation 15 of paper ii ) .",
    "we compare our completeness estimates with @xmath49 directly in fig .",
    "[ fig : w ] , and we find that the two completeness estimates are similar , but not identical .",
    "the main difference is due to the fact that @xmath50 in paper  ii also accounted for the 70% redshift success rate of the fors2 spectra .",
    "this is the correct approach if the completeness is independent of sfr ( i.e. emission line presence ) and redshift , which seems unlikely . in any case , this makes little difference for any of our results .",
    "when computing local densities , we can make use of all the spectroscopy , including those public redshifts for which [ oii ] is unavailable to us . in this case",
    "we consider a redshift completeness @xmath51 , defined as @xmath52 where now the numerator is a sum over all galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts . because we assume a @xmath39-function redshift pdf for galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts , this is equivalent to the number of galaxies with spectro - z within our redshift range .",
    "we show @xmath51 in figure  [ fig : w ] .",
    "note that @xmath51 is larger than @xmath41 at @xmath38 , because of the inclusion of public redshifts in fireworks for which sfr measurements are unavailable .",
    "figure [ fig : w ] shows that at the faintest magnitudes , where we have contributed new ldss3 spectroscopy , the completeness @xmath53 is quite high , reflecting the high sampling completeness of our survey ( paper  ii ) .",
    "the fact that the redshift completeness @xmath51 is also quite high ( @xmath54 ) at these magnitudes , indicates that the majority of these galaxies have ongoing star formation , for we only obtain redshifts for emission ",
    "line galaxies at these magnitudes .",
    "we have checked that galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts are distributed uniformly over our field ( see figure [ fig : tmap ] ) ; thus we do not need to apply a spatial completeness correction .",

    "* ) as the gray shaded area in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr.all ] .",
    "their data , which use 24@xmath99 luminosities to estimate sfr , show a similar trend but higher normalization compared with our data .",
    "we will explore this relation in more detail in a forthcoming paper ( paper iv ; gilbank et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "for now we are interested in the environmental dependence , and we divide this relation into bins of @xmath73 , as indicated on the figure .",
    "the choice of @xmath73 bins in the roles sample is determined by requiring a similar number of galaxies in each @xmath73 bin , and we choose the same bins when considering the sdss sample .",
    "both the roles and sdss samples show an increasing median sfr with larger @xmath0 in all environments , and the roles sample always has higher sfr than the sdss .",
    "again we observed that the lowest mass galaxies at @xmath12 show a significantly higher sfr in denser environments , while there is little or no trend locally .",
    "because massive galaxies possess higher sfr than low - mass galaxies due to their larger integrated gas content , the ssfr provides a better understanding of sfr efficiency .",
    "the ssfr is known to decline with increasing stellar mass both in low- and high - z galaxies , as an outcome of gradual decreasing sfr in galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , in figure  [ fig : ssfr_combined ] , we show ssfr as a function of stellar mass and @xmath73 ; both roles and sdss show that the ssfr decreases with @xmath0 .",
    "the roles sample exhibits higher ssfr than the sdss sample at a fixed @xmath0 , and the difference is more significant for lower stellar masses . we can interpret the ssfr as a ratio of current sfr to the past - average sfr . in the figure we plot horizontal lines indicating the age of the universe at @xmath10",
    "( gray dotted line ) and @xmath11 ( red short dashes ) .",
    "galaxies below these lines are inefficient in forming stars , i.e. their current sfr is much less than their past average .",
    "galaxies above the lines are more active and would be interpreted as having a current burst of sfr such that it exceeds the past average .",
    "the separation between the ` active ' and ` passive ' sfr regimes occurs at log(@xmath15)@xmath1610 at @xmath10 but at log(@xmath15)@xmath169.6 at @xmath11 , showing a mass dependence in the sense that that the contributors of sfr have shifted toward lower @xmath0 as redshift decreases .",
    "this provide evidence for down - sizing in sfr in the respect of the ` cross - over ' time between the ` active ' and ` passive ' sfr regimes .",
    "this accords with previous work such as that of juneau et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , which is overplotted as the gray solid curve , with the sfr recomputed using the mass - dependent correction in paper ii . however unlike that work ,",
    "our census is complete at @xmath7 for galaxies with masses below the cross - over mass .",
    "we explore this further in paper iv ( gilbank et al . in prep ) .    dividing the samples by @xmath73",
    ", we find that the evolution of this cross - over time holds in all environments . only the lowest - mass star  forming galaxies at @xmath12 ( less than @xmath16log(@xmath15)=9.5 ) exhibit an increasing ssfr with @xmath73 .",
    "no such dependence is seen in the local comparison sample ; if anything , there is a mild _ decrease _ in the mean ssfr at the highest densities , locally ( see also , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in other words , the lowest - mass star - forming galaxies in high - density regions have the largest decrease in ssfr from @xmath26=1 to @xmath11 .",
    "this suggest that the evolution of galaxies with @xmath100 is characterised by a more rapid decrease of star formation in moderately dense regions .",
    "paper ii presented the dependence of sfr density ( @xmath9 ) on stellar mass in the roles survey , finding the same shape as seen in the local sdss . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfrd_combined ] we now extend this to show @xmath9 as a function of @xmath0 in different environments , as measured by @xmath73 .",
    "the @xmath9 in each @xmath0 bin is computed following paper ii as @xmath101 where @xmath102 ( see  [ weight ] ) and @xmath103 is the maximum volume in which galaxy @xmath104 could be located and have been found as @xmath105 and @xmath31 .    including galaxies in all environments , our results in the top - left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfrd_combined ] are consistent with those of paper ii .",
    "we next present this same distribution in different @xmath73 bins , with results shown also in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfrd_combined ] .",

    ", there is no clear dependence of @xmath9 on environment .",
    "the small increase we see in median sfr toward higher densities appears to have little noticeable impact on the total sfr density .",

    "are combined together for the roles ( @xmath7 , black ) and sdss @xmath950.05 ( green ) samples .",
    "the data of the @xmath10 sample in paper ii are overplotted as red crosses .",
    "the top - right panel shows the same data , divided into bins of different environment , as measured by @xmath73 .",
    "the results for the sdss are presented in the bottom two panels . in the lower - left panel ,",
    "the @xmath73 bins are chosen to exactly match those in roles ; in the right panel we choose the @xmath73 bins to include an equal number of sdss galaxies in each bin .",
    "the gray curves in each sdss panel are the roles results from the top - right panel , for comparison .",
    "the roles sample exhibits a larger sfrd at all stellar masses than the sdss sample , reflecting the decline of global sfrd .",
    "little or no environmental dependence is observed at @xmath12 , which suggests that the small trend we observe  for low - mass galaxies to have higher sfr in denser regions  has little effect on the global sfrd .",
    "[ fig : sfrd_combined],width=302 ]",
    "we have used our highly sensitive , complete ldss3 spectroscopy in the cdfs field to probe the effects of environment on galaxy evolution at @xmath12 , for galaxies with masses lower than have ever been probed in this way before .",
    "we consider only star  forming galaxies , for which our survey , and @xmath90 comparison sample , are complete for stellar masses @xmath109 .",
    "locally , star forming galaxies show little dependence on environment .",
    "specifically , the correlation between sfr and mass , or between ssfr and mass , shows no dependence on local density .",
    "the situation is quite different at @xmath12 , where we find sfr and ssfr is actually somewhat _ larger _ in dense environments .",
    "thus we confirm the general trend found by others ; moreover , we find that this trend is stronger for galaxies with masses below those studied in previous work .",
    "this has little effect on the total sfr density however which , at fixed stellar mass , shows no clear trend with environment .    in summary , we find that the decline in sfr - mass and ssfr - mass relations from @xmath7 to @xmath110 depends on environment , with a faster decline in richer environments .",
    "note that , due to the small field size , our sample does not include the densest environments , such as the cores of rich clusters .",
    "recent results from @xcite suggest that it is in these intermediate density environments that star formation may be most enhanced , at @xmath7 .",
    "however these effects are small when compared to the intrinsic dependence of sfr and ssfr on mass itself . in agreement with other studies ,",
    "we conclude that mass is the dominant variable , driving the history of star - formation .",
    "environment appears to play a secondary role , albeit one that is more important for lower  mass galaxies .",
    "this may be expected , since the smaller gas reservoir of less massive galaxies may be more easily affected by environment .",
    "mechanisms such as galaxy mergers and harassment are are more likely in denser environments , and these may enhance the star formation activity within the galaxies , resulting in the positive sfr-@xmath73 and ssfr-@xmath73 trend we see at @xmath10 . since such vigorous star formation will speed up the consumption of cold gas within the galaxies , they would more quickly exhaust their gas supply . at later times , the star - formation rates would be then be _ less _ than the counterparts in poorer environments .",
    "while this work is among the first to spectroscopically probe the low - mass regime at @xmath7 , it suffers from limitations that can be addressed in future work .",
    "the main one is statistics : error bars can be greatly improved by larger area , future surveys .",
    "also roles lacks sufficient volume to probe the densest environments ( rich clusters ) in which the most massive galaxies are found ; interesting , recent work by @xcite suggests that the enhancement in sfr we find may not appear in such massive clusters .",
    "wider , or cluster  targetted , surveys in the future will be able to address this .",
    "future papers based on roles will explore the lower redshift regime in our survey . this will allow evolution to be explored further but also more extreme environments to be probed .",
    "this is possible because the fires patch contains a massive cluster , ms1054 - 03 , at @xmath26=0.83 , and the cdfs patch exhibits a large - scale filament ( and galaxy groups ) at @xmath26=0.73 .",
    "our work is based on a key assumption , that the mass - dependent conversion from [ oii ] to sfr derived in the local universe by @xcite can be applied to @xmath10 .",
    "as dust plays an important role in deriving sfr from [ oii ] flux , further inspection will be made using 24@xmath111 m and radio data in the future ( gilbank et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "however , in general , low - mass galaxies contain little dust and hence are undetected in those bands . since our key results lie in low - mass galaxies , and we are comparing trends at a fixed stellar mass , any systematics related only to mass should not affect our results about the relative star formation rates in different environments .",
    "finally we note that our work has focused on using local density estimators as a simple proxy for environment .",
    "an alternative approach worth pursuing would be to use linking algorithms to try and identify actual physical galaxy groups .",
    "this may allow a better connection from observables to theoretical concepts such as halo and sub - halo masses .",

    "in this appendix , we explore the sensitivity of our main results to our choice of density estimator .",
    "our measurement of environment is an estimator based on a biased , incomplete tracer population , and we expect that its correlation with a fundamental quantity ( such as dark matter density field ) will be both biased and noisy .",
    "we will not attempt to directly connect our estimates directly to more physical parameters like these ; however , we will ensure that we are able to distinguish high - density environments from low . to do this",
    ", we will use the local sdss sample , which benefits from both large area and high spectroscopic completeness .",
    "we first apply our computation of @xmath68 to the sdss sample described in",
    "  [ sdss ] , and compare with the density estimates of @xcite .",
    "the latter are computed based on a 2d , n@xmath112-nearest - neighbor method , for galaxies limited to @xmath113 with q=1.6 and @xmath114=0.05 from @xcite .",
    "the local galaxy density @xmath115 is calculated from the projected distance to the 5@xmath112 nearest neighbor , within a redshift slice of @xmath116=1000km / s centered at each seed galaxy . by comparison with simulations and models , @xcite",
    "show that @xmath115 correlates well with the smoothed , dark matter overdensity .",
    "we will therefore take this as our best estimate of the `` true '' density in the sdss , and in the following subsection we will compare how our methods and sample limitations compare with this .",
    "likely the biggest limitation of our @xmath12 sample , is the field size ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "our ldss3 spectroscopic coverage of cdfs is comprised of two adjacent , circular fields with diameter 8.3 , corresponding to @xmath16 4.1 mpc at @xmath10 .",
    "thus , we do not expect a large dynamic range of environment within our sample .",
    "moreover , our density estimator @xmath68 effectively smooths this density field over fairly large scales .",
    "the choice of using smaller @xmath75 results in higher resolution , but a noisier density estimate ; on the other hand , a larger @xmath75 reduces the difference between the extreme high and low density regions and smears out any trends which depend on local galaxy density .",
    "edge corrections also become more important for larger choices of @xmath75 . with our default choice of @xmath75=5 ,",
    "the median @xmath78 is @xmath162.6 mpc ( @xmath165.4at @xmath26=1 ) and @xmath80 is @xmath163.8 mpc ( @xmath1170.003 ) .",
    "the spatial component is thus actually larger the size of our field for median densities ; thus , most of the sensitivity comes from the redshift dimension .",
    "nonetheless , as we will show , it is still possible to distinguish high- and low - density environments .",
    "we carry out the test by randomly choosing 500 circular regions from the sdss stripe 82 sample , each with a diameter of 4.1 mpc at @xmath26=0.05 .",
    "thus , the field size is matched to the same physical area covered by a single ldss3 pointing at @xmath12 . in each field",
    "we compute @xmath68 with @xmath75=[3,5,7 ] .",
    "forty of these 500 circular regions are rejected because their mean @xmath68 are significantly larger than that in roles .",
    "the computed @xmath68 for these sdss galaxies have a 1@xmath29 dispersion of [ 0.46 , 0.22 , 0.08 ] , and the median @xmath78 are [ 1.39,2.16,2.8 ] mpc for @xmath75=[3,5,7 ] .",
    "we compare these @xmath68 , computed within the limited field size , with our best estimate of the `` true '' density field , @xmath115 .",
    "we find a 1@xmath29 dispersion between @xmath68 and @xmath115 are [ 0.67 , 0.49 , 0.47 ] dex for @xmath75=[3,5,7 ] .",
    "thus , for our default choice of @xmath118 , we can hope to distinguish environments separated by @xmath119 dex with @xmath120 confidence .",
    "we will show that our @xmath12 sample spans a factor of @xmath121 in @xmath73 ; thus we anticipate that differences between the highest and lowest - density environments in that sample will be meaningful .",
    "we proceed to check this further , by comparing our measurement of @xmath73 in sdss with quantities that have known environmental trends . in particular",
    ", we will consider the sfr and the specific sfr ( ssfr ) , the relevant quantities for our @xmath12 analysis . to improve the statistics",
    ", we stack the 28 circular regions that have an average density within 20% of each other , and comparable to the average density in our @xmath12 sample .",
    "this ensures that we have enough galaxies to reliably measure average galaxy properties , and that the dynamic range of density probed will be comparable to what we can expect from our survey . note the stacking does not reduce the noise , or potential bias , in our density esimate , since these estimates are still made on the individual fields .",
    "we show the average sfr and ssfr as a function of @xmath68 with @xmath75=5 in the stacked regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : dentest_sdss ] .",
    "we only include star  forming galaxies here , by selecting those with @xmath122yr@xmath123 .",
    "this effectively removes passive , red - sequence galaxies from the sample .",
    "we also limit this test to galaxies with log(@xmath15)=8.5 - 9.2 , which is the mass range of primary interest in this paper . in both cases",
    ", there is little trend with environment ; this result is expected since we are only considering the star  forming population .",
    "this demonstrates that systematics in our density estimator do not induce an artificial correlation in ssfr .",
    "the next test is to consider the fraction of star  forming galaxies ( @xmath124 ) in the sdss , since this is known to correlate strongly with density . here , we need to consider a sample limited at a higher stellar mass , log(@xmath15)@xmath1259.5 , because the passive galaxy population becomes incomplete below that limit . we show this fraction as a function of @xmath73 , limited to small fields as before , as the black dashed curve in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dentest_sdss ] .",
    "again , this is compared with the trend obtained using the full survey area , shown as the red curve .",
    "we see that a strong environmental dependence is still observed from the limited field areas , with surprisingly little evidence for any bias or smoothing of the trend .",
    "therefore , we conclude that despite the small field , our choice of density measure is robust and able to differentiate truly different environments , as also suggested in figure  [ fig : tmap ] .",

    "[ fig : glsd_wz]__,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]      next , we consider the effect of our completeness weights , and their sensitivity to the photo - z estimates ( which is the only place the photo - z play a role in our analysis ) .",
    "we examine how the choice of photo - z method might affect our computation of @xmath68 in fig .",
    "[ fig : glsd_wz ] , where we choose @xmath118 , and plot @xmath73 as a function of redshift completeness ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "regardless of which photo - z method is used , @xmath68 is not a strong function of redshift completeness .",
    "the _ rms _ dispersion between the two measurements of @xmath73 , on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis , is @xmath126 dex .",
    "thus we find that @xmath73 is fairly insensitive to the completeness correction , and thus to which photo - z method is used .",
    "we now consider whether @xmath73 itself is biased in the presence of spectroscopic incompleteness .",
    "the exercise is conducted by applying a spectroscopic incompleteness to our sdss stripe 82 sample , which is similar to the @xmath51 in roles .",
    "to do so , we take the @xmath51 as a function of @xmath42 in fig.[fig : w ] ( the fireworks curve ) , and then convert it into a function of @xmath127 based on the magnitude relative to @xmath128 .",
    "we use @xmath129=20.34 and @xmath130=17.26 .",
    "this produces a @xmath51 that starts to drop from 1 at @xmath127=16 to @xmath1310.52 at @xmath127=19.0 .",
    "galaxies are then removed randomly in each magnitude in to satisfy the ` expected ' @xmath51 in that magnitude bin .",
    "the original completeness in the sdss sample is also accounted for during this process .",
    "the re - computed @xmath73 correlates well with the original ( complete ) @xmath73 estimate , with a 1@xmath29 dispersion of only @xmath160.02 .",
    "we find no evidence for a bias at high or low densities from this experiment .",
    "our choice of a 3d , nearest - neighbour density estimator is one of several density estimators that have been used in the literature . in this subsection",
    ", we will explore how are results would be affected if we adopted a different method .",
    "we thus consider the sfr and ssfr of our lowest  mass galaxies in the @xmath12 sample , @xmath132log(@xmath15)@xmath133 .",
    "figure [ fig : dentest_roles ] shows how this depends on density for the variety of possible choices we will explore below , compared with our default choice of @xmath73 .    .",
    "the densities are computed with the various methods described in this appendix , as indicated in the plots .",
    "only galaxies with log(@xmath15)=8.5 - 9.2 are used in plotting the sfr and ssfr  density relation .",
    "the conclusions that both sfr and ssfr increases with density remain for most choices of densities .",

    "[ fig : dentest_roles],title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    first , we consider the sensitivity to the smoothing length by considering the effect of different choices of @xmath75 , by showing results for @xmath135 and @xmath136 in figure [ fig : dentest_roles ] . in all three cases",
    "we observe that the average ssfr and ssfr of the star ",
    "forming population _ increases _ with increasing density .",
    "this , our main result , is not sensitive to the choice of @xmath75 .",
    "next , we consider the effect of using a cylinder of fixed volume to compute density .",
    "this has the advantage that the smoothing scale does not depend on density , but has the disadvantage that the noise in the estimator does depend on density .",
    "we choose a fixed cylinder with @xmath78=2.6 mpc and @xmath80=3.8 mpc , and re - compute the density . the density is then computed as the sum of @xmath50 of galaxies within the cylinder divided by the cylinder volume , including a correction for edge effects .",
    "we denote this density as @xmath137 , and show the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : dentest_roles ] .",
    "again , the trend of increasing ssfr and with density is unchanged ; however the correlation between sfr and density has become insignificant .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that a fixed volume results in a large uncertainty in the lowest  density regions , as can be seen by the larger error bars of this measure in figure  [ fig : dentest_roles ] .",
    "elbaz et al .",
    "( 2007 ) compute a density within a comoving box , with dimension of 1.5@xmath1381.5@xmath13840 mpc (= 90 mpc@xmath139 ) . since we compare our sfr  density relation to theirs in ",
    "[ results ] , we calculate this density for our sample , and label it @xmath134 in fig . [",
    "fig : dentest_roles ] .",
    "the resulting densities are approximately an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath73 , and no correlation with sfr or ssfr is observed .",
    "this is because we have too few spectroscopic density tracers to sufficiently populate the fixed box size .",
    "thus it is not feasible for us to use this definition for our sample .",
    "an alternative option is to use a 2d , projected density .",
    "this is widely used in the literature , and we adopt the method described in @xcite . we explore the effect of making two redshift slices of @xmath108@xmath140=500 and 1000 km / s . within each redshift slice",
    "centered , at a target , galaxy , the local galaxy density is computed based on the projected distance to the nearest 5@xmath112 neighbor .",
