    "ground - based helioseismic observations ( _ e.g. _  gong : harvey _ et al . _ , 1996 ; bison : broomhall _ et al . _ , 2009 ) and space - based ones ( _ e.g. _  mdi : scherrer _ et al . _ , 1995 ; golf : gabriel _ et al . _ , 1995 ; or hmi : scherrer _ et al .",
    "_ , 2012 ) , have allowed us to derive a good description of the dynamics of the solar interior ( _ e.g. _  thompson _ et al . _ , 2003 ,",
    "garca _ et al . _ , 2007 , eff - darwich _ et al . _ , 2002 , 2008 , howe , 2009 ) .",
    "helioseismic inferences have confirmed that the differential rotation observed at the surface persists throughout the convection zone .",
    "the outer radiative zone ( @xmath1 ) appears to rotate approximately as a solid body at an almost constant rate ( @xmath2 nhz ) , whereas it is not possible to rule out a different rotation rate for the innermost core ( @xmath3 ) . at the base of the convection zone , a shear layer",
    " known as the tachocline  separates the region of differential rotation throughout the convection zone from the one with rigid rotation in the radiative zone .",
    "finally , there is a subsurface shear layer between the fastest - rotating layer , located at about @xmath4 , and the surface .",
    "of course , this rotation profile is not constant ; the time - varying component of the rotation displays clear variations near the surface ( known as the torsional oscillations ) , while we see hints of variations at the base of the convection zone , both being likely related to the driving mechanisms of the solar - activity cycle .",
    "our understanding of the dynamics of the solar interior has undoubtedly improved ; however we still need to constrain the rotation profile near the core and fully analyze the nature of the torsional oscillations .",
    "we still do not know how thin the tachocline really is and what is keeping it this way .",
    "understanding the tachocline should help discern if there is a fossil magnetic field in the radiative zone that prevents the spread of the tachocline ( zahn _ et al .",
    "_ , 2007 ) , or an oscillating magnetic field ( forgcs - dajka and petrovay , 2001 ) .",
    "no purely fluid - dynamics mechanism can explain the tachocline , resulting in a compelling argument for the presence of a strong magnetic field ( gough and mcintyre , 1998 ) .",
    "the proper knowledge of the relationship between the solar dynamics and its structure is not important only in order to understand the present conditions of the sun , but also to understand the temporal evolution of our star and other solar - like stars .",
    "it is usually assumed that the main characteristics of the dynamics of the sun were established during its contraction phase ( turck - chize _ et al .",
    "_ , 2010 ) , hence the sun was not a rapid rotator when it entered the zero age main sequence ( zams ) .",
    "the transport of momentum during the contraction phase might have been carried out by a magnetic field in the core and the diffusion of this field flattened the rotation profile in the rest of the radiative zone ( duez _ et al .",
    "_ , 2010 ) . in any case",
    ", theories about the mechanisms that drive the solar rotation and its spatial and temporal variations remain to be tightly constrained by improved helioseismic inversion results .",
    "better rotation profiles mean not only improved inversion methodologies but improved estimates of rotational - frequency splittings .",
    "we present here results derived using an improved inversion methodology that i ) adjusts the inversion grid ( over both depth and latitude ) based on the data set and its precision , and ii ) solves the inversion problem iteratively .",
    "but first we review recent developments in global mode characterization ( korzennik , 2008 ) that allowed us to infer with better confidence the internal - rotation rate and its time varying patterns .",
    "we describe in detail the inversion methodology and show the resulting profiles .",
    "we have used rotational frequency splittings determined from fitting data acquired with five different instruments .",
    "two are ground based : the _ birmingham solar oscillations network _ ( bison ) and the _ global oscillation network group _ ( gong ) and three are on - board spacecraft : the _ global oscillations at low frequencies _ ( golf ) and the _ michelson doppler imager _ ( mdi ) on board the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( soho ) , and the _ helioseismic and magnetic imager _ ( hmi ) on board the _ solar dynamics observatory _ ( sdo ) . for all but the last instrument , the available data sets span well over a decade of observations .",

    "the bottom panels correspond to our alternative fitting methodology , for @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9-day long time series ( left to right ) . ]",
    "the starting point of all helioseismic , linear rotational inversion methodologies is the functional form of the perturbation in frequency [ @xmath10 induced by the rotation of the sun , @xmath11 : @xmath12    the perturbation in frequency [ @xmath13 with the observational error [ @xmath14 that corresponds to the rotational component of the frequency splittings , is given by the integral of the product of a sensitivity function , or kernel [ @xmath15 with the rotation rate [ @xmath11 ] over the radius [ @xmath17 and the co - latitude [ @xmath18 . the kernels [ @xmath15 are known functions of the solar model",

    "one for each measured @xmath20  allows us to infer the rotation rate profile as a function of radius and latitude from a set of observed rotational frequency splittings ( hereafter referred as splittings ) .",
    "our inversion method requires the discretization of the integral relation to be inverted . in our case ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq : equation1 ] ) is transformed into a matrix relation @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the data vector , with elements @xmath20 and dimension @xmath19 , @xmath23 is the solution vector to be determined at @xmath24 model grid points , @xmath25 is the matrix with the kernels of dimension @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the vector containing the corresponding observational uncertainties . the number and location of the @xmath24 model grid nodes are calculated according to the effective spatial resolution of the inverted data set .",
    "such a procedure produces a non - equally spaced ( _ i.e. _   unstructured ) mesh distribution .",
    "a complete description and examples of the gridding methodology can be found in eff - darwich and prez - hernndez ( 1997 ) and eff - darwich _ et al . _",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "the resulting unstructured grid is used to compute the matrix @xmath25 in equation  ( [ eq : equation2 ] ) .",
    "that equation is then solved with a modified version of the iterative method developed by starostenko and zavorotko ( 1996 ) .",
    "this approach calculates @xmath23 according to the following algorithm : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the iteration index .",
    "the diagonal matrices @xmath30 and @xmath31 are calculated from the summation of columns and rows of matrix @xmath25 , respectively . for each iteration ,",
    "values for the error propagation and data misfit , @xmath32 , are calculated .",
    "helioseismology , as a tool to infer the properties of the solar interior , is based on the fact that different mode sets are sensitive to different layers of the sun .",
    "hence , by combining these mode sets , it is possible to derive the structure and dynamics of the solar interior .",
    "however , these sets are not homogeneous and the number and quality of the modes that are sensitive to the solar radiative interior is significantly lower than those sensitive to the convective zone and the surface layers ( as shown in figure  [ fig:0 ] ) . therefore , the dispersion and the level of uncertainties of the modes that are sensitive to the core are the largest for the entire data set .",
    "another problem arises as we look closely at the uncertainties ( see figure  [ fig:0 ] ) : the error level as a function of radius is not strictly monotonic . for a given inner turning radius ,",

    "the improvement is less apparent for the modes that are more sensitive to the solar core and in the data sets corresponding to shorter time - series .",

    "inversions using recent hmi data ( @xmath7 and @xmath49-day long ) are also presented , although they are not yet comparable to either mdi or gong results , since the amount of hmi observations is still significantly smaller .",
    "both mdi and gong inversions give similar results , with the largest discrepancies at high latitudes and below @xmath50 .",
    "the most significant difference between the inversions obtained by the same instrument is the reduction of the uncertainties , in particular random noise , when the length of the time - series used to fit is increased .",
    "this reduction is particularly important in the inner radiative core .",

    "this dip is seen in both mdi and gong results , notwithstanding the actual length of the fitted time series .",
    "this result is intriguing , particularly if we analyze the time evolution of the dip , for both mdi and gong derived profiles , as shown in figure  [ fig:35 ] .",
    "it was not possible to include the @xmath6 and @xmath54-day long results , since the quality of the inverted profiles at that depth and latitude is too low .",
