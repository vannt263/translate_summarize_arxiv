    "a sinusoidal electric field is applied to the ferroelectric sample while the polarization @xmath0 and/or polarization current density @xmath1 is continuously monitored .",
    "the observed data is then in principle utilized to determine the thermal remnant polarization @xmath2 and coercive field @xmath3",
    ".    some of the partially understood experimental results are as follows : ( i ) no unique coercive field is evident during the hysteretic process of switching .",

    "( iii ) multiple hysteresis loops are commonly observed .",
    "various approaches have been adopted to explain these strange characteristic features of the ferroelectric materials .",
    "one approach is to create a equivalent circuit models@xcite that simulate the experimental data .",
    "the earliest among these models are the sawyer - tower circuit@xcite and modifications thereof@xcite which are used to study the hysteretic properties of ferroelectric capacitors .",
    "currently , many of the circuit models are computed using the spice@xcite simulations .",
    "previous circuit models depend strongly upon which particular applications one is interested in analyzing .",
    "no single standard circuit has been put forward to explain the great variety of experimental results available for different regimes of electric field and frequency .",
    "our goal is to explore many of the experimentally observed properties employing a single circuit model .",

    "it is possible to analytically compute @xmath39 in two limits : @xmath40 @xmath41    a sufficient condition for existence of periodic eq.(19 ) solutions of eq.(18 ) is that @xmath42 be a fixed point ( solution ) of the equation @xmath43 if eq.(24 ) has a unique solution for @xmath44 , than there exists a unique periodic solution of eq.(18 ) .",

    "4 we have plotted two hysteretic loops corresponding to the same voltage amplitude but with different frequencies .",
    "the inner smaller hysteretic loop corresponds to a lower frequency than that of the outer larger hysteretic loop .    since the large amplitude and high frequency loops have a larger enclosed area than do the small amplitude and low frequency loops , it is not at once evident how to extract the coercive voltage directly from hysteretic loop data .",
    "this is a well known problem in attempting to measure the coercive electric field forcing a polarization flip .",
    "the nature of the problem becomes evident from a study of the effective circuit in fig .  1 .",
    "the _ theoretical _ `` coercive voltage '' @xmath52 is that voltage across the lower branch non - linear capacitor present at the time when the polarization flips .",
    "the _ experimental _",
    "`` coercive voltage '' @xmath53 includes the voltage across the resistor .",
    "it is not an easy matter to separate the dissipative voltage from the thermal capacitor voltage .    in order to understand the `` area '' enclosed by the hysteresis loop in the @xmath48 plane ,",
    "one notes that the thermodynamic work performed by the non - linear capacitor during one cycle is given by @xmath54 which is also ( via the first law of thermodynamics ) the heat dissipated by the resistor @xmath19 during the cycle .",
    "the area enclosed by the hysteretic loop is large or small , respectively , when the dissipated heat in the resistor is large or small .    in order to understand",
    "the role of dissipative heating in more detail , multiply eq.(10 ) by the current @xmath55 and integrate the result over time for one cycle ; i.e. @xmath56 the first term on the right hand side of eq.(28 ) obeys @xmath57 we then see directly that the work done by the non - linear capacitor during one cycle must be dissipated as heat in the resistor ; i.e. eqs.(26 ) , ( 27 ) , ( 28 ) and ( 29 ) imply @xmath58 thus , a large applied voltage amplitude and/or a large applied voltage frequency yield a large area loop because more heat is dissipated per cycle by the resistor .",
    "from the parity symmetry of the energy equation of state @xmath59 , the are two possible thermal _ equilibrium _ minimum energy states at @xmath60 in the absence of a driving voltage . for a _ small driving amplitude _",
    "@xmath61 in eq.(13 ) , we then expect two possible periodic charge response functions @xmath62 @xmath63 on the other hand , for a _ large driving amplitude _",

    "the regions in the @xmath70 plane are exhibited corresponding to the symmetric and broken symmetry dynamical phases . in the broken symmetry phase ,",
    "there are two possible hysteretic curves ; @xmath71 is localized in the neighborhood of @xmath72 and @xmath73 is localized in the neighborhood of @xmath74 .    for a more clear picture of the bifurcation@xcite boundary curve at @xmath75",

    "6(a ) and fig .",
    "6(b ) correspond , respectively , to @xmath80 for the values @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the symmetry is broken because only _ one _ of the ovals ( @xmath83 or @xmath84 but not both ) will appear in an experiment described by the model .",
    "the oval in the unbroken symmetry phase corresponding to @xmath85 is unique but does not appear very similar to conventional hysteretic curves . by increasing the amplitude to @xmath86",
    "a conventional looking hysteretic loop appears in fig .",
    "it has been shown that the landau - khalatnikov model of ferroelectric hysteresis has a very rich dynamical structure .",
    "only a small part of the symmetric dynamical phase had been reported in standard literature .",

    "further insights on how to measure the coercive voltage can be obtained by driving the circuit in fig .  1 with a voltage source which has both dc and",
    "ac components @xmath88 the dc voltage component @xmath89 can be put into the energy function via @xmath90 leaving eq.(12 ) in the form @xmath91    the advantage of employing a dc component is now evident .",
