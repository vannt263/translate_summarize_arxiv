    "echo - mapping and photoionization modeling shows that luminous qsos strong broad emission lines arise within 1 pc of the ionizing continuum , from gas with a range of distances , velocities ( 1000 km s@xmath5  10,000 km s@xmath5 ) , densities ( at least @xmath6 @xmath4  @xmath7",
    "@xmath4 ) , and optical depths .",
    "this is the broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "its average line strengths can be reproduced quite well ( the `` locally optimally emitting cloud '' model of baldwin et al .",
    "1995 ; see korista s discussion in this volume ) . beyond",
    "the blr , at distances up to many kiloparsecs , is lower density and lower velocity ( @xmath8 km s@xmath5 ) gas of the narrow line region ( nlr ) .",
    "because qso spectra are similar , the emphasis until recently , has been on explaining the average qso spectrum . however , investigating _ relationships _ among qso spectral parameters ( absorption and emission ) as a function of the properties of the ionizing continuum is a powerful way to further explore how the central dynamo works ( francis et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "there are two important sets of relationships linking central engine properties with the surrounding gas  the baldwin effect in the uv ( baldwin et al .",
    "1978 ) , and the optical  x - ray `` eigenvector1 '' relationships first clearly presented by boroson & green ( 1992 ) .    the baldwin effect is an inverse relationship between qso luminosity and the equivalent width ( ew ) of civ@xmath11549 ( baldwin et al . 1978 ) , and other broad emission lines ( kinney et al . 1990 ) . because qsos are exceedingly luminous and therefore visible at high redshifts , ews could serve to determine luminosity distances .",
    "qsos could then be a tool for cosmology .",
    "this hope has not been fulfilled because there is too much scatter in the baldwin relationships .    in optical qso samples ,",
    "much of the spectrum - to - spectrum variation is explained by the strong eigenvector 1 relationships ( hereafter called principal component 1 or pc1 ) : as h@xmath0 from the blr becomes narrower , the strength of blr feii ( optical ) emission increases , [ oiii ] nlr emission decreases , and the optical  x - ray and x - ray spectra steepen ( increasing @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where f@xmath11 ) ( boroson & green 1992 , laor et al .",
    "1994 , 1997a , grupe et al .",
    "these relationships link the emission - line properties to the central engine : + @xmath12 the uv to soft x - ray region dominates the radiated power and ionizes the blr .",
    "+ @xmath12 in principle , line widths ( profiles ) , together with blr distances based on echo - mapping time - delays or dust - sublimation radii , may be used to infer the virial central masses , hence l@xmath13 ( peterson et al .",
    "1998 , laor 1998 ) .",
    "qso luminosities often appear to be significant compared with l@xmath13 , suggesting that accretion onto a central black hole could be an unstable process , giving rise to winds .",
    "+ @xmath12 line widths are also related to @xmath10 , linking kinematics directly to a central engine property . by analogy with galactic black hole candidates in their `` high '' states",
    ", steep x - ray spectra may be related to high accretion rates ( pounds , done , & osborne 1995 ) .",
    "+ @xmath12 the structure of the blr must be linked to @xmath10 and hence probably to accretion and outflowing winds .",
    "one possible explanation for the inverse feii-[oiii ] relation is that the smaller the effective covering of the central engine by optically thick blr gas , the more photons are available to ionize the more distant nlr ( boroson & green 1992 , brotherton , this volume ) .",
    "+ @xmath12 clues to the geometry may also come from the fact that the blr appears to see more continuum power than we infer from the observed continuum ; there are too few ionizing photons to explain the line strengths  especially low ionization lines like feii , but also heii@xmath11640 ( netzer 1985 , korista et al .",
    "1997 ) .    here",
    "we present new uv relationships linking qsos spectral energy distribution and the kinematics , structure and physical properties of the emitting gas .",
    "we show how these relationships could be used to reduce the scatter in the baldwin relationship and lead to understanding of the effect itself .",
    "we have investigated the uv spectra of 22 qsos from the complete , optically selected sample of 23 qsos with complete and high quality rosat ( 0.15 - 2 kev ) spectroscopy ( laor et al .",
    "this is the same sample for which laor et al .",

    "clearly the uv  soft - xray continuum photoionizes the surrounding gas and the emission lines can , in principle , provide information on the shape of the ionizing continuum . _",
    "uv spectrophotometry _ provides further pieces for the puzzle by relating the central engine to the kinematics , geometry and density of fueling gas or outflows : + @xmath12 siiii]@xmath11892 probably arises from almost the same region as ciii ] and most optical and uv feii , but ciii]@xmath11909 is collisionally suppressed at high densities @xmath2110@xmath2 @xmath4 , thus increasing the ratio siiii / ciii ] ( e.g. laor et al .",
    "our observed dependence of siiii]/ciii ] on feii strength is therefore consistent with the high densities and column densities required to produce strong feii(optical ) ( ferland & persson 1989 , wills , netzer & wills 1985 ) .",
    "+ @xmath12 the civ emission is strongly correlated with [ oiii]@xmath15007 . as suggested to explain the inverse feii-[oiii ] relation , does this mean that thick high density feii - emitting gas shields more distant civ - emitting gas ?",
    "+ @xmath12 the strength of the higher - ionization nv@xmath11240 also appears to be associated with this higher density gas , while civ strength decreases with increasing pc1 ( i.e. , feii , etc . )",
    "this apparent anomaly is reminiscent of the behavior of the ew(nv ) baldwin relation in which the slope of the baldwin relation for several other species is tightly correlated with ionization potential , but for nv the dependence on luminosity is much less than expected .",
    "korista et al .",
    "( this volume , 1998 ) show that the ew ( nv ) ",
    "luminosity relationship can be understood if very n - rich gas ( hamann & ferland 1993 ) is irradiated by a uv  soft - xray continuum whose strength increases with luminosity .",
    "while this is a complex issue , perhaps our nv anomaly can be similarly explained by enhanced n abundances .    the ` mystery physics ' underlying the pc1 relationships could be an increase in l / l@xmath13 associated with an increase in dense , feii emitting gas of high metallicity .",
    "it has been suggested that the extreme low ionization spectra with strong feii are somehow related to starbursts ( lpari et al .",
    "could starburst activity cause high accretion rates , hence strong soft x - rays ?",
    "what do our new results mean for the baldwin effect ?",
    "our pca suggests that the strong first principal component ( pc1 ) relationships that we find are independent of luminosity .",
    "the second principal component , pc2 , apparently represents the baldwin effect  inverse relationships between ew and luminosity . because we find strong links among line strengths and uv  x - ray continuum parameters , it is clear that these relationships must cause significant variation in equivalent widths from one qso to another .",
    "even if their cause is unknown , the relationships between line strengths and observables independent of l could be used to remove most of the scatter in baldwin relationships .",
    "could the cause of pc1 remove not only the scatter from the baldwin relationships , but also remove the baldwin effect itself ?",
    "not if pc1 is independent of luminosity ; investigation of larger samples is needed . however",
    ", if the variance of emission - line strengths could be attributed entirely to differences in the ionizing spectral energy distribution , the crucial question would then become : how and why does the ionizing spectral energy distribution depend on luminosity ?",
