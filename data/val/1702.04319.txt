    "superresolution optical far - field microscopy has undergone a tremendous evolution since roughly two decades ago it was shown that the classical resolution limit @xcite posed by diffraction can be overcome @xcite , resulting in the development of a large variety of methods achieving superresolution .",
    "one group of methods relies on stimulated ground or excited state depletion and a non - linear response of fluorescence markers to given excitation intensities to deterministically engineer the effective excitation point spread function ( psf ) @xcite .",
    "other methods stochastically localize single photoswitchable molecules with an accuracy of a few ten nanometers via centroid fitting of the psf @xcite .",
    "another branch of methods makes use of higher - order intensity cross correlations in the fourier plane @xcite or auto correlations in the image plane of a microscope @xcite . for the latter group of correlation microscopy techniques ( cm )",
    ", either super - poissonian bunched light emission due to statistical fluctuations @xcite or sub - poissonian anti - bunched light emission of fluorescence markers can be used to enhance the resolution , both in widefield @xcite and confocal microscopy @xcite .",
    "finally , structured illumination microscopy ( sim ) leads to a doubled resolution by use of the principle of moir fringes and linear wave optics @xcite , and its non - linear derivative saturated sim ( ssim ) leads to further improvements and in principle unlimited resolution , though at the cost of necessitating high intensities @xcite .",
    "other derivatives combine sim with the third - order process of cars or with graphene plasmons to access more higher spatial frequency information than ordinary sim @xcite .",
    "note that sub - wavelength phenomena can also be found in other fields of physics , for example in sub - wavelength atom localization due to the non - linear behavior of coherent population trapping ( cpt ) @xcite and sub - wavelength lithography via rabi - oscillations @xcite .",
    "cpt was also proposed to highly increase the resolution in a microscopy themed derivative @xcite .    here",
    "we report on a novel superresolution method that relies on intensity correlation measurements in the image plane of a microscope in combination with structured illumination to image fluorophores that exhibit anti - bunching .",
    "we therefore term it structured illumination quantum correlation microscopy ( siqcm ) .",
    "linear low - intensity excitation and linear detection suffice such that the technique holds promise to highly enhance the resolution in biological imaging .",
    "detrimental effects due to high intensities that are required by many superresolution techniques , leading to phototoxicity and photobleaching in fluorophores , do not arise .",
    "we demonstrate that already very low correlation orders @xmath0 provide highly enhanced superresolution , that scales favorably as @xmath3 .",
    "the present manuscript focuses on the highly enhanced lateral resolution using a simple widefield microscopic setup , however one can easily extend the scheme as cm as well as sim each on their own already provide optical sectioning capability for 3d imaging @xcite .",
    "the technique makes use of @xmath0th - order correlations and antibunched photon emission , inherently present in most common fluorophores , even at room temperature @xcite .",
    "hence , the required quantum emitters are already broadly in use in fluorescence microscopy .",
    "furthermore , sim is a well established technique in biological imaging with commercial microscopes , attaining the theoretically predicted resolution enhancement , being widely spread .",
    "let @xmath4 be the psf of a given microscope , where @xmath5 denotes the position in the image plane and @xmath6 is the corresponding optical transfer function ( otf ) obtained by fourier transform ( @xmath7 ) , where @xmath8 denotes the spatial frequency in reciprocal space .",
    "later , in the @xmath0th - order correlation microscopy signals @xmath9 the effective psf reads @xmath10 and its corresponding otf shall be defined as @xmath11 . in general @xmath12 gets narrower for increasing correlation order @xmath0 and its full width half maximum ( fwhm ) approximately scales as @xmath13 .",
    "vice versa , the observable region in reciprocal space is increased for @xmath11 by @xmath1 . microscopes usually possess the circularly symmetric airy disk @xmath14 with @xmath15 as psf @xcite , what allows to resolve individual incoherent emitters as individual sources of radiation as long as their separation @xmath16 is at least on the order of @xmath17 or more precisely @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "we denote the rayleigh limit as @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the numerical aperture of the microscope objective and @xmath21 the wavelength of the emitted fluorescence light .",
    "w.l.o.g we assume a magnification of one ( or rather minus one ) throughout our theoretical treatment such that the coordinates in the object and image plane @xmath22 and @xmath5 , respectively , can be regarded as equal , i.e. @xmath23 .    to measure fluorescence photons in the image plane the fluorophores in the object plane need to be driven by an excitation light field . in classical linear optics",
    "the fluorophores respond linearly to a given excitation intensity @xmath24 . treating the fluorophores quantum mechanically as a two - level system with ground @xmath25 and excited state @xmath26 ,",
    "however , this is only the case for intensities @xmath27 , where the saturation intensity @xmath28 depends on the exited states lifetime @xmath29 .",
    "the general expression for the intensity emitted by a two - level system driven by a given excitation intensity ( in units of the @xmath30 ) reads @xcite @xmath31 in ordinary classical microscopy with fluorophores that possess lifetimes on the order of a few ns or below intensities usually remain in the linear regime . to induce non - linear responses , e.g. required by sted microscopy @xcite or ssim @xcite , very high intensities are necessary that are accompanied by detrimental effects to biological imaging . in contrast , our approach contents with low intensity and linear response of fluorophores to achieve highly increased superresolution .",
    "let us first assume a continuous and spatially uniform excitation illumination in the object plane with intensity @xmath32 and the fluorophore density distribution @xmath33 to be comprised of individual point - like sources at positions @xmath34 that emit statistically independent , i.e. incoherent radiation .",
    "note that we can also assign ( relative ) weights to the independent emitters in case their photon emission rates differ .",
    "differences in ( relative ) emission rates would be enhanced in the ( higher - order ) intensity auto correlations .",
    "however , usually fluorophores emit sufficiently uniform and our technique does not require very high correlation orders to achieve highly enhanced superresolution , in contrast to sofi @xcite .",
    "further , in sofi this problem is resolved by using balanced cumulants @xcite and our higher order correlation signals can be adapted accordingly . therefore , and to keep the analysis illustrative we consider uniform emission rates here . considering a linear response ,",
    "i.e. @xmath35 , the intensity in the image plane reads @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the positive frequency part of the electric field operator and @xmath38 is the lowering operator acting on the fluorophore at @xmath34 , which can be approximated by a two - level system with ground and excited states @xmath39 and @xmath40 . the phases @xmath41 are varying randomly and independently on time scales larger than the excited states lifetime @xmath29 and introduce the incoherence as the expectation value @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "note that the intensity @xmath44 can be recognized as glauber s first - order equal - time intensity correlation function @xmath45 , assuming an ergodic system @xcite .",
    "taking the square @xmath46 we obtain an incoherent sum of narrowed psfs @xmath47 , however in addition also the detrimental cross terms .",
    "these cross terms can be removed by subtracting the second - order intensity auto correlation function @xmath48 . here ,",
    "the squared terms @xmath49 vanish as each two - level system can emit only one photon simultaneously , that is @xmath50 . subtracting the signals we obtain @xmath51 what is the sought - after anti - bunching @xmath52 signal @xcite .",
    "higher - order @xmath53 signals are derived analogously taking into account higher - order correlation functions up to @xmath54 .",
    "the resolution enhancement of this signal moderately scales as @xmath1 with the correlation order , what is also illustrated in reciprocal space by the central ( blue ) circles in fig.[fig : sim+abm ] that define the observable regions for ordinary intensity measurements , @xmath52 and @xmath55 ( from left to right ) .",
    "now , considering a two - dimensional structured illumination @xmath56 $ ] , a linear response of the fluorophores and ordinary intensity measurements one obtains a doubled resolution by the principle of moir fringes . the illumination pattern and the investigated sample produce beat patterns in the object and the image plane such that initially unobservable spatial frequencies in reciprocal space are shifted by the amount @xmath57 into the observable region and thus can be accessed ( cf .",
    "left side in fig.[fig : sim+abm ] ) .",
    "in general it is useful to define @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the orientation and @xmath60 is the adjustable phase of the pattern .",
    "note that larger @xmath61 effectively enlarge the observable region in reciprocal space and thus the resolution by a higher amount , however @xmath61 is limited by diffraction and the given numerical aperture @xmath20 of the microscope objective .",
    "hence , by use of far field wave optics infinitesimally dense fringe spacings in the source plane can not be produced . following the derivation for eq.([eq:1 ] ) with adjusted @xmath62 , the resulting signal reads ( see also ref .",

    "] where we used the convolution theorem and the identity @xmath66 . the density in reciprocal space",
    "is denoted by @xmath67 which arises together with its shifted versions , offset by @xmath68 .",
    "one image does not allow to separate the three individual components , such that three images with three different phases @xmath69 are required , creating the linear system @xmath70 , where the matrix @xmath71 describes the resulting system and @xmath72 denotes a vector with entries @xmath67 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the vector @xmath75 on the right hand side of the system possesses the entries @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 which represent the fourier transforms of the ( experimentally ) measured data .",
    "the system is solved by applying the inverse matrix @xmath79 . to sufficiently cover the enlarged area in reciprocal space it is necessary to chose at least three orientations @xmath80 ( cf .",
    "left side in fig.[fig : sim+abm ] ) resulting in a total of 9 measurements .",
    "taking a non - linear fluorophore response into account higher harmonics of @xmath81 arise enabling access to higher spatial frequencies in reciprocal space via ssim .",
    "the arising higher harmonics can be read out easily when plugging @xmath82 into eq.([eq : int ] ) as the excitation illumination and compiling the fourier cosine series which reads @xmath83 however , this comes at the cost of necessitating high intensities that lead to phototoxicity and photobleaching in most biological samples and fluorophores .",
    "furthermore , the fourier coefficients @xmath84 rapidly decrease with increasing @xmath85 , such that only a limited number of higher harmonics surpasses noise inherently present in every ( experimental ) signal .",
    "another drawback is the necessity for a very high number of images as each higher harmonic requires two additional phases @xmath60 and more orientations @xmath86 are needed to cover the enlarged observable region in reciprocal space @xcite .",
    "our new approach combines the strength of both methods to enhance the already superresolving signals tremendously within the linear low - intensity regime .",

    "eq.([eq:6 ] ) is depicted in the middle of fig.[fig : sim+abm ] , where due to the additional higher harmonic images with five different phases @xmath93 per orientation are required .",
    "the need for a large number of orientations @xmath86 is however relaxed due to the enlarged disks . considering maximum speed we chose four orientations @xmath94 resulting in a total of 20 images to sufficiently cover the highly enlarged observable area . when speed is not the major goal one can chose more orientations @xmath86 to obtain a higher quality what is also considered in regular sim .    after obtaining the individual fourier components @xmath67 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 they need to be assembled properly in reciprocal space , that is applying the same procedure which is conducted in sim .",
    "the extracted raw components are so far scaled by the circularly symmetric otf @xmath90 or by its shifted versions @xmath97 and @xmath98 . to obtain an approximately homogeneous disk we divide the enlarged observable area ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig : sim+abm ] ) into subregions and rescale the components by use of a wiener filter @xmath99 , where the constant @xmath100 prevents division by zero . in general the modulus of @xmath101 depends on the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) a given measurement provides .",
    "after assembly we apply a triangular apodization , resembling the fourier transform of an airy disk , to the homogeneous disk to reduce ringing in the final image @xcite .",
    "the final image is obtained by taking the modulus of the inverse fourier transform of the assembled ( and post - processed ) disk in reciprocal space .",
    "using more advanced deconvolution methods proposed and applied in sim would result in an even further enhanced resolution @xcite .",
    "for the simulations we chose masks with point - like emitters and calculated data as it would be detected by a ccd with discrete and finite pixels . note that , here we are assuming perfect data , i.e. discrete intensity values matching theoretical calculations without noise .",
    "experimental requirements to obtain the sought after siqcm signals with preferably high snr , i.e. sufficient statistics for the second and higher - order correlations , will be discussed later . for rescaling by use of the wiener filter we used @xmath102 .",
    "the pixel size and post - processed area where chosen in such a way that the offsets in reciprocal space approximately match integer numbers as we considered a real valued sinusoidal modulation . to remove the necessity for integer numbers in reciprocal space ( challenging to realize in a real experiment ) one can use a complex wave vector in real space @xcite .",
    "simulations illustrating the resolution power of ordinary intensity measurements @xmath103 , @xmath104 , sim and @xmath105 are presented in fig.[fig : comparison ] , where a 3x3 array of independent emitters with separations @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 is imaged by use of the enlisted techniques .",
    "the first array is resolved by every method , as the chosen distance corresponds to the classical resolution limit , however with @xmath103 barely resolving individual emitters .",
    "@xmath52 provides a moderately increased resolution and sim the second best resolution power .",
    "we want to point out that even though @xmath52 and sim already provide superresolved images , @xmath109 outperforms both methods by far and provides the highest resolution power . reducing the source separation to @xmath107 only sim and @xmath109 can resolve the individual emitters and finally , for @xmath108 , only our new method resolves the array . resolving the last array corresponds to a resolution improvement of 3.45 , exactly matching the theoretical prediction .    to show the resolution power of our technique that scales very favorably as @xmath3 compared to ordinary @xmath110 that merely scales as @xmath1 we also present simulations for third - order @xmath111 ( see illustration on the right hand side in fig.[fig : sim+abm ] ) .",
    "we chose six orientations @xmath112 resulting in a total of 42 images as seven phases @xmath60 are required per orientation .",
    "in fig.[fig : g3sim ] the resulting final images for the same 3x3 array with @xmath108 imaged by use of @xmath103 , @xmath113 and with three different reconstruction approaches for @xmath114 are presented together with the corresponding observable region in reciprocal space .",
    "the source distribution that was previously just resolved by @xmath109 is not resolved by @xmath55 but clearly resolved by the @xmath115 signal . for the first reconstruction approach we subdivided the observable regions in sections and rescaled the fourier components by the wiener filter . the resulting image ( third column )",
    "is simply the modulus of the inverse fourier transform of the homogenous disk . to remove the ringing we further omitted small imaginary parts acquired throughout the numerical evaluation ( which should be zero in theory ) and cropped negative values ( fourth column ) .",
    "note though that this approach might not be used this easily on real data with noise .",
    "the reconstruction method presented in the last column shows the triangular apodization applied to the homogenous disk .",
    "this method has also been used to produce the images in the last column of fig.[fig : comparison ] .",
    "the final image is again simply the modulus of the inverse fourier transform . in the given simulation",
    "the approach that crops negative values to remove ringing performs best and provides the smallest fwhm of the effective psf .",
    "resulting images for another mask are depicted in figs.[fig : comparison2 ] and [ fig : g3sim2 ] to show that the method can be applied to arbitrary emitter distributions .",
    "in contrast to the first mask three emitters have been omitted to obtain an irregular array .",
    "the siqcm signal again outperforms the cm and sim signal by far , as was discussed in detail in the previous section .",
    "we introduced a new quantum imaging technique we call siqcm which is based on the profitable merger of linear sim with anti - bunching cm . for a linear low - intensity standing wave illumination pattern and linear detection of photon auto correlations in the image plane of a microscope",
    "our technique provides in theory unlimited superresolution with improvement scaling favorably as @xmath116 with the correlation order @xmath0 .",
    "hence , it has the potential to increase the spatial resolution in imaging a variety of samples and in particular biological ones .",
    "further , we anticipate the siqcm concept to be applicable to super - poissonian bunched light emission ( e.g. used in sofi , due to on - off blinking of fluorophores ) , where auto correlations in the image plane can be combined into cumulants that equally lead to a signal with narrowed psf . adding structured illumination will not only introduce offsets by @xmath117 but also higher harmonics with offsets up to @xmath118 . optical sectioning capability provided by cm as well as sim",
    "can also be implemented enabling three - dimensional imaging with most likely increased axial resolution , due to higher harmonics in z - direction compared to 3d - sim @xcite .",
    "our new siqcm approach would bring similar benefits to two - photon microscopy @xcite , and vice versa . considering a standing wave excitation pattern with wavelength within the red or near infrared part of the spectrum , short wavelength photons from the uv or blue part of the spectrum",
    "are emitted by fluorophores due to two - photon absorption .",
    "since the absorption cross section is inherently dependent on the squared excitation intensity the resulting effective illumination structure is of the form @xmath119 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath120 corresponds to the near infrared illumination wavelength and shifts by @xmath121 ( corresponding to the fluorescence wavelength ) as used in regular sim already appear in the fluorescence intensity signal .",
    "evaluating correlations additionally would result in taking the @xmath122-th power of the structured illumination resulting in higher harmonics with offsets up to @xmath123 .",
    "the well - known advantages of two - photon microscopy , high penetration depth , energy deposition ( and thus photobleaching ) only within the vicinity of the focal plane and inherent optical sectioning capability would be added to our highly improved superresolution .",
    "using bunched light emission our approach should be applicable with state of the art technology and reasonable speed as sofi already provides acquisition times of a few seconds . to obtain",
    "the sought - after cm and siqcm signals auto correlations in the image plane can also be determined by evaluating cross correlations of neighboring pixels , what reduces experimental requirements and introduces an effectively denser sampling in the image plane @xcite .",
    "the latter fact is of practical importance as resolutions achievable with siqcm often exceed the sampling density of ccd cameras in use and thus interpolation can be circumvented .",
