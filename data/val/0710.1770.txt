    "about two dozen supernova remnants ( snrs ) are known to host 1720  mhz oh masers ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . the excitation mechanism for 1720  mhz masers in snrs",
    "is commonly believed to be collisional excitation from a c - type shock @xcite .",
    "other ground - state oh transitions are sometimes seen in absorption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which can be helpful for modelling the physical conditions in the 1720  mhz masing region @xcite .",
    "however , to date no other oh transition , nor a transition of any other molecule , has been detected as a maser associated with an snr .",
    "the detection of a second maser transition in snrs would place strong constraints on physical conditions ( density , temperature , oh fraction , ortho - to - para h@xmath2 ratio , etc . ) in the masing region , especially if spatial coincidence with a 1720  mhz maser was observed .",
    "excited - state transitions , which occur at higher frequencies , would be especially useful if detected toward the galactic center , where angular scattering is large ( see   1 of * ? ? ?",
    "another motivation for finding a second masing transition in snrs is to confirm the zeeman interpretation of splitting seen between left and right circular ( lcp , rcp ) components at 1720  mhz .",
    "differences in lcp and rcp velocities are used to compute magnetic field strengths in snrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , important for quantifying magnetic pressures .",
    "however , @xcite shows that circular polarization can be generated by non - zeeman mechanisms when the maser is saturated and splitting is small compared to a line width , as is the case in snr 1720  mhz masers . while there are theoretical reasons to believe the zeeman interpretation of snr 1720  mhz maser splitting ( see   4.1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , direct confirmation of the magnetic field strengths from a second oh transition would lend greater confidence in the derived magnetic field strengths .",
    "theoretical modelling predicts that collisions alone can excite several transitions of oh . in the low - density ( @xmath3  @xmath4 ) regime , only the 1720  mhz transition is inverted , but at higher number and/or column densities the 6049  mhz transition also becomes inverted , with some overlap in parameter space allowing simultaneous inversion of the 1720 and 6049  mhz lines @xcite . at still higher densities",
    "( @xmath5  @xmath4 ) , the 4765 and 1612  mhz transitions become inverted @xcite .",
    "the 6035  mhz line may also become inverted at high temperatures ( @xmath6  k ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "regardless of the details of the pump mechanism , weak inversion ( emission ) is predicted in the 6049  mhz and weak anti - inversion ( enhanced absorption ) in the 6016  mhz line from the structure of the oh level diagram alone when infrared trapping becomes important @xcite .",
    "few observations have sought excited - state oh masers in snrs .",
    "@xcite looked for 6030 , 6035 , and 6049  mhz oh maser emission toward southern snrs but did not detect any 6049  mhz emission .",
    "although they did find three new 6030 and 6035  mhz maser sources , @xcite",
    "believe that these masers are associated with regions and therefore represent emission from star - forming regions ( sfrs ) , not snrs . in states of higher excitation , @xcite searched for emission in the 4.7  ghz @xmath7-doubling triplet and the 7.8 and 8.2  ghz quadruplets toward four snr complexes ( as well as the 23.8  ghz quadruplet toward sgr  a  east ) but did not detect any emission .",
    "@xcite also cross - correlated positions of single - peaked and irregular - spectrum 1612  mhz masers from blind surveys in the literature with positions of known snrs but found no probable associations .    for small velocity differences along the amplification path ,",
    "the 6049  mhz transition is theoretically the most promising transition in which to find new oh snr masers , given that the collisional excitation conditions require only slightly higher densities than those that produce 1720  mhz masers .",
    "we report on targeted observations of the four 6.0  ghz lines mostly toward snrs with bright 1720  mhz masers .",
    "we observed 32 target positions with the effelsberg 100 m telescope in two runs on 2007  july  12 and 13 .",
    "pointing centers are given in table  [ source - table ] .",
    "observations were taken in position - switched mode using the 5 cm primary focus receiver .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) beam size of the telescope is approximately 130  at the 6.0  ghz frequencies of oh . the assumed sensitivity of the telescope is 1.55  kjy@xmath1 .    data were collected using both the ak90 8192-channel autocorrelator as well as the fast fourier transform spectrometer ( ffts ) .",
    "the ak90 was configured to produce 8 spectral windows of 10  mhz bandwidth , each divided into 1024 spectral channels with an effective channel spacing of 0.5  kms@xmath1 .",
    "two spectral windows , one each for lcp and rcp , were centered at the systemic lsr ( local standard of rest ) velocity of the source in each of the four transitions at 6016.746 , 6030.747 , 6035.092 , and 6049.084  mhz . on the second day , velocities were shifted by 20  kms@xmath1 to confirm that features present in the data were not artifacts of the autocorrelator .",
    "data from the ffts were of lesser quality but were used to confirm that suspected features were not artifacts of the ak90 system .",
    "the data were reduced using the continuum and line analysis single - dish software ( class ) package .",
    "hanning smoothing was applied to the data to remove the effects of correlated noise generated by strong continuum and line sources .",
    "polynomial baselines were removed from the scans .",

    "we note , however , that we do not see emission in w3(oh ) near @xmath11  kms@xmath1 at 6030  mhz to a @xmath12 level of 30  mjy in stokes  i ( after hanning smoothing the spectral resolution to 1  kms@xmath1 to eliminate ringing from the bright masers ) , as previously reported by @xcite .",

    ". parameters for the 6016  mhz absorption are @xmath15  mjy at @xmath16  kms@xmath1 and a line width of @xmath17  kms@xmath1 . the emission and absorption span the same velocity range ( full width at zero power ) , although the peak of the emission is narrower ( fwhm ) than the absorption peak , in qualitative agreement with the observations of @xcite .",
    "the agreement in velocities suggests that the 6016  mhz absorption and 6049  mhz emission come from the same physical region in w3(oh ) .",
    "generally no absorption is seen toward these snrs .",
    "likely absorption is detected in the main lines in the galactic center region ( figure  [ fig - ae ] ) , although spectral baselines are poor due to strong continuum flux .",
    "the velocity ( @xmath18  kms@xmath1 ) , width ( @xmath19  kms@xmath1 6030  mhz , @xmath20  kms@xmath1 6035  mhz ) , and location of the strongest absorption ( on the east side of sgr  a east ) are all consistent with the densest @xmath21co seen in the data of @xcite , suggesting that excited - state molecular content is strongest in that region .",
    "similar but weaker features are seen in other scans on the eastern side of sgr  a east , but we can not rule out that absorption - like features seen near @xmath0  kms@xmath1 in the other sgr  a scans are due to errors in baseline removal . as discussed in ",
    "[ ae - discussion ] , this absorption may be due to the unusual molecular cloud in the region rather than its interaction with the snr . otherwise , no absorption is seen in any of the four transitions in any of the other sources , even when scans from separate sources ( excluding the galactic center sources ) are aligned in velocity and co - added .",
    "we also observed and , the only two evolved stars in which excited - state oh emission has previously been reported @xcite . in neither case",
    "do we detect any emission .",
    "this is consistent with the expanded very large array observations of @xcite taken less than two months previously , in which no maser emission is definitively detected in either the 6030 or 6035  mhz transitions toward nml  cyg .",
    "though our original interest was on the 6.0  ghz oh transitions in snrs , we start off the discussion with our findings on our reference source , the sfr region w3(oh ) .      the 6049  mhz ( @xmath22 ) emission in w3(oh ) is stronger than the 6016  mhz ( @xmath23 ) absorption , as noted in the calculations by @xcite , who did not detect the 6016  mhz absorption at all .",
    "this effect , in which 6016  mhz absorption is enhanced relative to the expected lte value ( from 6030 and 6035  mhz absorption ) and the 6049  mhz line is seen in weak absorption or even emission , was seen in other sfrs by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this behavior was predicted by @xcite , who showed that anti - inversion at 6016  mhz and inversion at 6049  mhz should occur whenever the 120  @xmath24 m radiation linking the first - excited @xmath25 state with the ground @xmath26 state in the @xmath27 ladder is optically thick , regardless of the details of the pump mechanism .",
    "interestingly , a similar phenomenon is seen in the next highest state in the @xmath27 ladder .",
    "absorption in the 13442  mhz ( @xmath28 ) transition is always stronger than at 13433  mhz ( @xmath29 ) and always enhanced from lte values compared to the main lines @xcite .",
    "the @xcite result is generalizable : whenever intra - ladder decays dominate and are optically thick , the @xmath30 line will be seen in enhanced absorption and the @xmath31 line will be seen in emission or reduced absorption .",
    "for the 13.4  ghz transitions , infrared overlaps in the 84  @xmath24 m transitions linking the @xmath32 and @xmath33 states may also be important , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "we find that a gaussian fit to the 6049  mhz emission in w3(oh ) is also _ narrower _ than the fit to the 6016  mhz absorption , even though the full width at zero power of the two lines is the same .",
    "this is consistent with weak inversion and suggests that the 6049  mhz emission should be understood as a low - gain maser , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "further sensitive observations at higher spectral resolution will be required to confirm the maser nature of the 6049  mhz emission .",
    "high angular resolution interferometric observations would be particularly useful to determine the size and brightness temperature of the 6049  mhz emission region , as well as to isolate the region of emission and determine whether the inversion exists over the entire source or merely in cluster c ( in the nomenclature of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which must be a region of very high excitation based on the presence of highly - excited oh @xcite .    in general , satellite - line masers are seen almost exclusively in the lowest states of the @xmath27 and @xmath34 ladders . in the @xmath35 rotational state ,",
    "masers are seen in the 1612  mhz transition in evolved stars and some sfrs , and 1720  mhz masers are seen in snrs and some sfrs .",
    "masers in the @xmath36 state are seen only in sfrs , with 4765  mhz ( @xmath37 ) masers much more common than 4660  mhz ( @xmath38 ) masers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "even though the brightest main - line 6030 and 6035  mhz masers in sfrs can have flux densities of several hundred  jy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , the only other satellite - line maser found to date is the low - gain 6049  mhz maser in w3(oh ) .",
    "it thus appears to be a general result that it is extremely difficult to invert satellite lines except in the lowest rotational state in each ladder .",
    "we see 6030 and 6035  mhz absorption near @xmath0  kms@xmath1 in pointings on the eastern side of sgr  a east .",
    "the absorption at 6035  mhz is deeper than at 6030  mhz , as would be expected for thermal absorption .",
    "this absorption is likely neither part of the interaction of the snr with the molecular cloud nor located at the interaction region ( with most 1720  mhz masers in the slightly higher velocity range @xmath39@xmath40  kms@xmath1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although interferometric confirmation , as with the expanded very large array ( evla ) will be required to establish the location of the absorption .",
    "the molecular material is denser to the east and partially obscured by the circumnuclear disk to the west @xcite , consistent with our absorption detections as well as the ground - state absorption detected by @xcite .",
    "the detection of excited - state absorption toward sgr  a east but not toward any other snr may find its explanation in a chance alignment , the special conditions in the galactic center region , or a combination thereof .",
    "the difference with the other snrs may be due to the geometry of a dense cloud in the line of sight with a relatively intense radio continuum background in the case of sgr  a east , resulting in a larger column density and absorption of oh . or , the difference may be due to a difference in heating of the cloud : the + 50  kms@xmath1 cloud toward sgr  a east may be heated more , not by the impact of the snr into the cloud @xcite but , e.g. , due to a strong local radiation field absorbed by high - metallicity material , dissipation of kinetic energy or collisions of local clumps in a steep gravitational potential , etc .",
    ", providing a larger column density of oh in excited states .",
    "as this absorption is likely not due to the snr , further studies are required to investigate its origin .",
    "interferometric observations would be very useful in order to understand the distribution of excited - state oh in the molecular cloud near sgr  a east .",
    "higher angular resolution than that provided by effelsberg will be required to understand the origin of the 6.0  ghz absorption in sgr  a east .",
    "this absorption is an obvious target for reobservation with the evla when a sufficient number of antennas are equipped with the new c - band ( 48  ghz ) receivers .",
    "no emission was seen in any 6.0  ghz transition toward snrs . to date ,",
    "a total of 23 @xmath7-doublet transitions have been observed toward snrs : the quadruplets at 1.6 , 6.0 , 7.7 , 8.1 , and 23.8  ghz and the triplet at 4.7  ghz .",
    "only the 1720  mhz transition produces a detectable maser .",
    "the 6049  mhz transition is the next one after 1720  mhz predicted to go into inversion as densities are increased @xcite , yet searches for 6049  mhz masers have not uncovered any detections ( this work , as well as * ? ? ?",
    "searches for snr oh masers at 4765 and 1612  mhz , the next two transitions expected to produce masers via collisional excitation , have also produced only non - detections @xcite .",
    "it is probable that no oh masers , other than in the 1720  mhz transition , will be detected toward snrs with current instrumentation .",
    "absorption at 6016  mhz is not seen toward any snr , despite predictions that it should be anti - inverted .",
    "we do not see absorption toward snrs with the exception of 6030 and 6035  mhz absorption toward sgr  a east .",
    "much more sensitive observations will be required to test whether excited - state @xmath30 transitions are in enhanced absorption in snrs .",
    "no emission was seen toward the evolved stars au gem and nml cyg .",
    "excited - state oh maser emission has previously been reported in the 4750  mhz transition toward au gem @xcite and the 6035 ( and possibly 6030 ) mhz transition toward nml cyg @xcite , although subsequent observations have failed to confirm these detections ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is likely that excited - state oh maser emission from evolved stars is temporary and extremely rare @xcite .",
