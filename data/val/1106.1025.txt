    "the anti de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence @xcite provides a powerful theoretical method to investigate the strongly coupled field theories .",
    "it may have useful applications in condensed matter physics , especially for studying scale - invariant strongly - coupled systems , for example , low temperature systems near quantum criticality ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently , it has been proposed that the ads / cft correspondence also can be used to describe superconductor phase transition @xcite .",
    "since the high @xmath1 superconductors are shown to be in the strong coupling regime , one expects that the holographic method could give some insights into the pairing mechanism in the high @xmath1 superconductors .",
    "inspired by the idea of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the presence of horizon @xcite various holographic superconductors have been studied in einstein theory @xcite or extended versions as gauss - bonnet ( gb)@xcite , horava - lifshitz theory @xcite and weyl corrected ones @xcite .",
    "ads / cft can also describe superfluid states in which the condensing operator is a vector and hence rotational symmetry is broken , that is , p - wave superfluid states @xcite .",
    "all these works are based on a numerical analysis of the equations of motion ( eom ) near the horizon and the asymptotic limit by a suitable shooting method .",
    "but as we know that the analytical methods are better and easy for invoking in different problems .",
    "recently some attempts have been done on analytical methods in superconductors ( see for example @xcite and the references in it ) . in @xcite the authors have shown that one can obtain the critical exponent and the critical temperature by applying a variational method on the eom .",
    "their method and terminology is simple and very sound . instead of involving in numerical problems ,",
    "we can obtain the critical temperature @xmath1 and the exponent of the criticality very easily by computing a simple variational approach .",
    "they studied different modes of super criticality s - wave , p - wave and even d - wave .",
    "their good and efficient method can be applied on other condensers with higher order lagrangian black hole .",
    "recently , we applied this method to superconductors in the presence of the magnetic field @xcite , which our results are in good agreement with numerical results produced previously @xcite .",
    "another semi analytical method is based on the matching method , in which we match the asymptotic solutions at a mid point . after matching",
    ", we can obtain easily the expectation values of the dual operators @xmath5 and the critical temperature @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , this method has been used by several authors @xcite . in these topics",
    "the effect of the external magnetic field is very important .",
    "a holographic model of superconductor with external magnetic field previously has been studied numerically @xcite . here as we can observe ,",
    "the higher order terms make the condensation harder .",
    "we can study the backreaction effects in the presence of magnetic field .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to investigate the effect of the backreaction on the magnitude of the critical magnetic field @xmath2 .",
    "we calculate the backreaction corrections up to first order of @xmath6 to the critical temperature @xmath1 and the critical magnetic field @xmath2 for a gb superconductor ( to see more about @xmath2 in superconductors refer to @xcite ) .",
    "we show that the gb coupling @xmath3 makes the condensation weaker but the backreaction corrections make the critical magnetic field stronger .",
