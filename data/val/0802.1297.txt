    "the application of superconductors crucially depends on the high electric current density without dissipation .",

    "this conventional picture has been changed with the discovery of high-@xmath0 superconductors@xcite and the progress in random field systems@xcite .",
    "similar to the spin - glass system , fisher et al suggested that , for strong disorder , the system freezes into a genuine thermodynamic amorphous vortex glass ( vg ) phase with some kind of glassy long - range orders@xcite .",
    "the vg phase in strongly type ii superconductors has attracted considerable attentions both experimentally and theoretically@xcite during the past more than one decades .",
    "it is of practical significance that the vg phase is a true superconducting state with a vanishing linear resistivity by diverging energy barriers . on the fundamental side ,",
    "it is closely related to an important class of phenomena in condensed matter physics , such as spin glasses , random field systems@xcite , and charge - density waves in solids@xcite .",
    "the evidences to support the existence of a vg phase have been reported in many experiments by means of the dynamic scaling of the measured current - voltage ( iv ) data@xcite . however , strachan et al .",
    "have shown that a perfect collapse of the iv data is not the sufficient evidence for a vg transition @xcite , since the critical temperature and the scaling exponents are not uniquely determined by this dynamic scaling .",
    "theoretically , the xy gauge glass model@xcite has been extensively employed to study the vg transition .",
    "the values for the critical exponents are similar to those obtained in some experiments @xcite . however , lacking some of properties and symmetries due to the absence of net magnetic fields , it is questioned to be a model of disordered superconductors in an applied filed@xcite .",
    "some realistic models have then been proposed recently , but the conclusions were quite contradictory .",
    "continuous finite temperature vg transitions have been given by most models with various critical exponents .",
    "it was also observed that the vg phase disappears if the screening of the vortex interaction due to the gauge field fluctuation is included@xcite .",
    "the simulation of the london - langevin model suggested no vg phase@xcite .    among all vortex models , the disordered three - dimensional ( 3d ) xy model with net magnetic fields",
    "has provided both equilibrium and dynamical vortex phase diagrams in type - ii superconductors with weak disorder @xcite . the low field ( weak disorder ) low temperature phase is in general regarded as a dislocation - free bragg glass with a quasi - long - range order@xcite , which was observed directly in a neutron experiment@xcite .",
    "several dynamical simulations on the vortex matter with rather low fields for weak disorder have been performed in this model@xcite . by a anisotropic frustrated 3d xy model with strong disorder in the coupling constants , olsson @xcite",
    "provided evidence for the vg transition in the unscreened limit .",
    "the correlation length exponent @xmath1 was obtained , consistent with the 3d gauge glass universality . within an isotropic model with different choice of strong random - coupling distribution ,",
    "kawamura @xcite reported similar results for the vg transition independently .",
    "although the obtained value @xmath2 is slightly smaller , which within the error bar also suggests a common universality with the 3d gauge glass model .",
    "however , it was found later that a convincing scaling collapse for helicity modulus could not be achieved in kawamura s model@xcite , possibly due to the small effective randomness in the small system accessed .",
    "furthermore , to the best of our knowledge , the dynamical study in the frustrated 3d xy model with strong disorder is so far lacking , which is however more relevant to experiments in the context of vg transitions .    in this paper ,",
    "based on resistively - shunted - junction dynamics , we perform large scale dynamical simulations on the frustrated 3d xy models for two typical sets of parameters in refs .",

    "1(a ) and 1(b ) present the resistivity @xmath53 as a function of current @xmath54 at various temperatures for models i and ii , respectively .",
    "it is clear that , at lower temperatures , @xmath55 tends to zero as the current decreases , which follows that there is a true superconducting phase with zero linear resistivity . while @xmath55 tends to a finite value at higher temperatures , corresponding to an ohmic resistivity in the vortex liquid .",
    "these observations provide a evidence of the existence of the vg phase in both models .    assuming that the vortex glass transition is continuous and characterized by the divergence of the characteristic length and time scales @xmath56 ( z is the dynamic exponent ) , fisher , fisher , and huse @xcite proposed the following dynamic scaling ansatz to analyze the glass transition from a vortex liquid with ohmic resistance to a superconducting glass state , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the correlation length which diverges at the transition .",
    "@xmath59 is a scaling function with the + and - signs corresponding to @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "( [ ffh ] ) was often used to scale measured iv data experimentally@xcite .",
    "right at @xmath46 , the @xmath62 curve should show a power law behavior @xmath63 where @xmath64 , which provides a convexity - concavity criterion to identify the vg transition temperature as well as the dynamic exponent @xmath9 . as shown in figs .",

    "the error bar is estimated by tuning the value of @xmath75 until the collapse becomes poor evidently .",
    "the value of @xmath75 is very close to @xmath76 obtained in ref . @xcite through equilibrium monte carlo simulations of model i. also as indicated in fig .",

    "it should be mentioned that the present analysis method for the vg phase transition is not essentially inconsistent with that described in ref .",
    "we also think that only the perfect collapse of the iv data is not a sufficient evidence for a vg transition , so we use the convexity - concavity criterion to identify @xmath46 and determine @xmath9 before performing the dynamic scaling .    in equilibrium",
    "monte carlo simulations of model ii , some quantities failed to provide good scaling@xcite .",
    "the helicity modulus was used in the finite size scaling analysis of the vg phase transitions in both models@xcite , a nice scaling is obtained in model i , but scaling fails applied to model ii for data in system sizes @xmath80 .",
    "the collapse of the transverse helicity modulus with poor quality gives @xmath81 , @xmath82 , which differed significantly from those in ref . @xcite .",
    "more seriously , it was impossible to collapse the data for the parallel helicity modulus .",
    "it has been observed@xcite that the correct behavior required a great flexibility of the field induced vortex lines , which could be obtained either with a very large size or with weak interplane coupling along the field direction . for the isotropic system in model ii , the possible way to get a convincing scaling collapse of some quantities is to enlarge the systems . in the present large scale dynamical simulations , a excellent collapse of the iv data in the dynamic scaling is indeed achieved .",
    "the exponents @xmath75 in the present two models are close to @xmath83 evaluted by olson and young@xcite , but different from the recent more accurate result @xmath84 obtained by katzgraber and campbell @xcite in the 3d gauge glass model , suggesting that they are not in the same universality class .",
    "it follows that the difference in the quenched randomness and the introduction of net fields may change the static critical properties of the vg transitions .",
    "the dynamic exponents @xmath9 in these two models are found to be quite different .",
    "the exponent @xmath9 in model i is high , in the range @xmath85 $ ] usually measured in experiments@xcite , in model ii is however considerably low .",
    "note that small values of the exponent @xmath9 were also reported@xcite .",
    "in addition , both exponents @xmath9 in models i and ii can not fall even within the error bar of that in the 3d gauge glass model , which were estimated to be @xmath86 in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath87 in ref .",
    "@xcite , although the exponent @xmath9 in model i seems to be more close .",
    "it is possible that the disorder in the coupling constant along the filed direction in model ii reduces the effective pinning strength @xcite , leading to a small iv power law exponent at the vg transition .",
    "it is not expected that enlarging the system size further along the field direction would change the dynamic exponent @xmath9 essentially .",
    "nevertheless , the reason for the small value of @xmath9 in model ii is not fully understood at the present stage , the further investigation is clearly called for .",
    "with the vg phase in hand , we then study the depining and creep motion of the vortices in this phase for both models . to study the depinning transition at zero temperature ,",
    "we start from high currents with random initial phase configurations . the current is then lowered step by step .",
    "the steady - state phase configurations obtained at higher currents are chosen to be the initial phase configurations of the lower currents in the next step .",

    "note that the depinning exponents for both models are greater than @xmath95 , consistent with the mean field studies on charge - density wave models@xcite .",

    "it is worth noting that , in the london - langevin model , the stable vg phase with the freezing of disordered vortex matter is not found@xcite and instead the vortices freeze like a window glass , called vortex molasses scenario . in the framework of the frustrated 3d xy model , the existence of a stable vg phase is well established in the unscreened limit in the present dynamical simulations , as well as in previous equilibrium monte carlo simulations@xcite . in the real strongly type - ii superconductors ,",
    "the screening induced rounding of the sharp vg transition is only a weak effect , and only visible at temperatures very close to @xmath46 .",
    "the present good scaling behavior in the creep motion is just observed far below @xmath46 .",

    "the vortex loop between the planes perpendicular to the field is absolutely excluded , while in the present 3d xy models , the vortex loops between the planes can be induced by both thermal activations and the quenched disorder .",
    "so we argue that the disorder strengths in these two different kinds of models are hard to compare .",
    "interestingly , the combined depinning exponent @xmath125 was also observed in the depinning of domain walls in the 3d random - field ising model @xcite , possibly suggesting a universal rule in high dimensional elastic systems . whereas the present results are different from recent results for ( 1 + 1 ) elastic interfaces in a disorder medium@xcite , possibly owing to the two - dimensional nature in the latter .",
    "further work is needed in order to clarify these observations .",
