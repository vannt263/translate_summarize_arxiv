    "searches for planets orbiting evolved stars have been underway for more than a decade .",
    "a major science goal of these campaigns has been to explore the dependence of planetary system properties on host star mass  precise radial velocities can be obtained for these `` retired a stars '' whereas a - type dwarfs present few absorption lines from which doppler information can be extracted . however , of the 94 planets known to orbit giant stars ( log @xmath2 ) , only seven have semimajor axes @xmath3au .",
    "this is in spite of a strong bias favoring the detection of short - period planets .",
    "about 2000 evolved high - mass stars are currently being monitored worldwide by various teams , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) . given that short - period planets are common around solar - mass stars , there is an open question : where are the short - period planets around high - mass stars ?",
    "@xcite proposed that planetary orbits are affected by the evolution of the stars , showing how tidal interaction can lead to the engulfment of close - in planets .",
    "this process is strongly influenced by stellar evolution details such as the stellar mass , mass - loss , and metallicity .",
    "engulfment appears to be much more efficient for more - massive planets and less - massive stars @xcite .",
    "giant and subgiant stars sample planet hosts that , in principle , are more massive than their main sequence counterparts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this supposition ( taken alone ) has been used to suggest a relation between planet formation and stellar mass @xcite .",
    "we note that the masses of these evolved stars have been the subject of some controversy , e.g. @xcite . in brief",
    ", @xcite argues that due to the stellar initial mass function and the rapid evolution of more massive stars , a given evolved star is more likely to be a `` retired '' sun - like star than a `` retired a star '' as put forward by @xcite and @xcite . while this relation might still hold",
    ", there is , however , an increasing number of close - in planets being detected in the main - sequence stage orbiting a - f stars ( e.g. , hat - p-49 , bieryla et al .",
    "2014 ; wts-1b , cappetta et al . 2012 ; kepler-14b , buchhave et al . 2011 ; wasp-33b , collier cameron et al . 2010 ; kelt-3b , pepper et al .",
    "2013 ; ogle2-tr - l9b , snellen et al .",
    "these close - in planets are not found in radial velocity searches around evolved stars , suggesting that it is the evolution of the star , and not its mass , that plays a major role in removing planets from close orbits .",
    "thus the discovery of a population of short period planets around evolved stars can offer fundamental insights into the strength of the tidal forces .",
    "understanding these tidal forces is critical for producing accurate models of planetary orbits as stars evolve off the main sequence .",
    "furthermore , they can help to shed some light on the dependency of the planet formation process on the stellar mass , with important implications for gas giant planet formation and migration .",
    "in fact , close - in planets are expected to enter the stellar envelope as the star leaves the main sequence and evolves onto the red giant branch @xcite . as the star evolves , it removes planets from a region that extends far beyond the stellar radius to the entire region of tidal influence ( @xmath4 for a jupiter - mass planet ) . during the subgiant phase ,",
    "the star first clears out the very close - in planets present during the main - sequence evolution , and then proceeds to clear out a larger region as the stellar radius increases when it ascends the red - giant branch .",
    "however , the vast majority of the evolved stars targeted by radial - velocity surveys have not completed their ascent up the red - giant branch , and so are not at their maximum radius .",
    "the evolved stars currently known to host planets have typical radii smaller than about 6  @xcite .",
    "stellar evolution models by @xcite show that for a 2  star , the radius exceeds 0.1au",
    "( i.e. a 10-day orbital period ) for only the 40 million years immediately preceding the helium flash . for these reasons ,",
    "we only expect planets orbiting closer than @xmath50.15 au to be lost to their expanding host star , and this only excludes planets with @xmath115 days @xcite .",
    "our survey will search for the planets with @xmath6 days which are common around main - sequence stars , but missing around evolved stars .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : section 2 describes the weihai echelle spectrograph ( wes ) , and the target selection criteria .",
    "section 3 demonstrates the ability of the wes to deliver precise radial velocities by presenting new data and orbital fits for the known planet - hosting giant beta gem ( hd62509 ) .",
    "finally , we give our conclusions in section 4 .",
    "the weihai echelle spectrograph ( wes ) is a bench - mounted , stabilised , fibre - fed spectrograph attached to the 1-metre telescope located at the weihai observatory of shandong university in weihai , china .",
    "the spectrograph is thermally stabilised to @xmath70.10 k. light is fed from the telescope into the spectrograph by @xmath010 m of circular fibre with diameter 70@xmath8 m via a 160@xmath8 m pinhole .",
    "it can achieve a maximum resolution of 57,000 with 2.2-pixel sampling .",
    "the wes is the first fibre - fed echelle spectrograph in china , and has the primary function of radial - velocity planet search .",
    "further details about the spectrograph and the weihai observatory site can be found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the observing and data analysis procedures are typical of precise radial - velocity planet searches .",
    "doppler velocity observations are performed at a resolving power of @xmath945,000 .",
    "calibration of the spectrograph point - spread function is achieved using an iodine absorption cell temperature - controlled at 65.0@xmath70.1@xmath10c . the iodine cell imprints a dense forest of narrow absorption lines on the stellar spectrum , from 5000 to 6200 , permitting the contemporaneous calibration of the spectrograph point - spread function @xcite .",
    "velocities are obtained using the _ austral _ code @xcite , which has been successfully used by several planet - search programs for more than 10 years @xcite .",
    "the iodine region is broken into @xmath0380 100-pixel chunks , corresponding to about 4.3per chunk .",
    "the chunks are weighted by their doppler content ( defined as the sum of all pixel to pixel gradients ) , and each chunk produces a radial velocity relative to the iodine - free template spectrum . the final velocity is computed as the mean value of the chunks after an iterative 3@xmath11 clipping to reject outliers .",
    "the uncertainty is the standard error of the mean , i.e. the rms scatter divided by the square root of the number of accepted chunks .",
    "we chose a small sample of bright giants , starting with northern hemisphere _ hipparcos _",
    "stars with @xmath12 and luminosity classes iii and iv @xcite .",
    "after removing all stars flagged for variability , double / multiple stars , and suspected composite spectra , we imposed a colour cut @xmath13 to match the selection criteria of many evolved - star planet - search surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we then required @xmath14 to exclude the most - evolved stars which would be subject to large - scale pulsations that confound radial - velocity searches for planets @xcite . to reduce the impact of pulsations on the detectability of planets",
    ", we also required that the _ hipparcos _ photometric scatter be smaller than 0.005 mag . from the scaling relations of @xcite , this threshold corresponds to velocity amplitudes smaller than 5 - 10 , a level comparable to our photon noise and small compared to the expected amplitudes of giant planets in short - period orbits .",
    "the 42 remaining targets are enumerated in table  [ targetlist ] .",
    "our knowledge of short - period planets orbiting these evolved stars remains limited by the observing strategies employed by the major programs .",
    "radial - velocity surveys are usually subject to the exigencies of telescope scheduling , such that they are typically allocated time in a single short run each month ( during the bright lunation ) .",
    "the `` rocky planet search '' campaigns conducted by the anglo - australian planet search addressed this problem by observing a subset of @xmath030 stars every night for 48 consecutive nights .",
    "those campaigns have demonstrated dramatically increased sensitivity to short - period planets @xcite .",
    "clearly , high cadence is the way forward @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite were able to conclusively detect the 89-day planet orbiting the k giant hd121056 by densely sampling its orbit using chiron , a spectrograph dedicated to precise radial - velocity planet search @xcite . to achieve the best possible cadence ,",
    "our survey has been allocated @xmath0100 nights per year on the weihai observatory 1 m telescope .",
    "six of our 42 targets are known planet hosts ( table  [ planethosts ] ) .",
    "they are useful members of the sample because ( 1 ) further monitoring can often reveal additional planets @xcite , and ( 2 ) the repository of data on these systems can serve as a check on the new data being obtained by this survey .    beta gem ( hd62509 , hip37826 ) is an extremely bright k0 giant ( @xmath15 ) known to host a planet with @xmath16 days and m  sin  @xmath17=2.76  @xcite .",
    "we have 38 observations of hd62509 over a 500-day baseline , with a mean internal velocity uncertainty of 8.6 .",
    "exposure times ranged from 300 - 900 seconds , with typical s / n@xmath0200 - 300 per pixel .",
    "an iodine - free template spectrum was obtained on 2014 march 7 , and all velocities given in table  [ weihaivels ] are computed relative to that template .    to check the consistency of the weihai data , we include all published velocities spanning more than 25 years to fit a keplerian orbit to the planetary signal .",
    "our analysis uses eight data sets , seven of which have already been published .",
    "@xcite presented velocities from the cfht ( @xmath18 ) and dao ( @xmath19 ) , calibrated using an hf gas cell @xcite , a precursor to the currently - used iodine cell technique .",
    "the beta gem planet discovery paper @xcite gave 38 radial - velocity measurements from the mcdonald observatory 2.1 m telescope .",
    "@xcite reported a further 22 epochs from the ongoing mcdonald observatory 2.7 m `` phase 3 '' planet - search ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and 11 epochs using a higher - resolution , limited wavelength setting on the same telescope ( `` cs21 '' as desribed in hatzes et al .",
    "2006 and wittenmyer et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the tautenburg observatory planet search ( tops ) also yielded 22 radial velocities as presented in @xcite .",
    "finally , 80 velocities from lick observatory given in @xcite were included in our fit .",
    "we used the _ gaussfit _ nonlinear least - squares code @xcite to obtain a keplerian model fit for all eight data sets simultaneously .",
    "the velocity data now span 33.5 years .",
    "uncertainties were estimated using the bootstrap routine within _ systemic 2 _",
    "@xcite on 10,000 synthetic data set realisations .",
    "the results are given in table  [ planetparams ] , and the most recent cycles including the weihai data are plotted in figure  [ plot ] .",
    "the rms about the fit for the weihai velocities is 7.3 , comparable to the previously published data , and consistent with the stellar oscillation amplitude of 5 - 6  found by @xcite .",
    "this result demonstrates that the weihai data acquisition and doppler velocity extraction techniques are robust .",
    "close - in planets ( @xmath3 au , @xmath1100 days ) are rare around giant - branch stars .",
    "we have begun an observational program at the 1 m telescope located at weihai obervatory of shandong university , using its stabilised echelle spectrograph to obtain precise doppler velocity measurements of a sample of bright giant stars .",
    "we aim to observe these stars with as high a cadence as possible to search for these `` missing '' planets .",
    "preliminary results from this progam give excellent results for the known planet - host beta gem ( hd62509 ) , and confirm our ability to obtain precise velocities with this new instrument .",

    "<S> we describe a high - cadence observational program to obtain precise radial velocities of bright giants from weihai observatory of shandong university . </S>",
    "<S> we present data on the planet host beta gem ( hd62509 ) , confirming our ability to derive accurate and precise velocities ; our data achieve an rms of 7.3  about the keplerian orbit fit . </S>",
    "<S> this planet - search programme currently receives @xmath0100 nights per year , allowing us to aggressively pursue short - period planets to determine whether they are truly absent . </S>"
