    "rs  ophiuchi is a recurrent nova that has undergone nova eruptions in 1898 , 1933 , 1958 , 1967 , 1985 , and possibly @xcite 1907 . as in the case of a classical nova",
    ", the eruption follows a thermonuclear runaway on the surface of the white dwarf @xcite .",
    "the key differences between classical and recurrent novae , in terms of both system properties and outburst behaviour , are reviewed by anupama .",
    "the recurrents are a heterogeneous class of objects but the rs  oph  type is characterized by a semi - detached binary consisting of a roche - lobe - filling m  giant mass donor ( m8iii in the case of rs  oph ; @xcite ) and a massive ( close to the chandrasekhar limit ) white dwarf ( _ classical _ novae almost exclusively have cool _ dwarf _ mass donors ) .",

    "the spectra have been dereddened for @xmath2 @xcite and the dereddened fluxes are reported in table  [ nebular ] for the he and o lines and in table  [ coronal ] for the coronal lines .",
    "assuming that the continuum that is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ data ] is optically thin free - free and free - bound emission , we estimate the electron temperature to be @xmath0  k for all three of our observations , but note that the flux calibration for the march observation is not reliable as the data were taken through cloud . this temperature is constrained primarily by the magnitude of the brackett and pfund discontinuities at 1.45  and 2.28  respectively ( fig .",
    "[ cont ] ) .",
    "the electron temperature derived from the optically thin emission is considerably less than that implied by the presence of ir coronal lines in the spectra ( see below ) , or inferred from radio @xcite and x - ray @xcite observations .",
    "there remains an excess at wavelengths @xmath3 , some ( but not all ) of which may be due to a contribution from the shocked gas .",
    "using flux ratios for the hydrogen recombination lines , and assuming case  b @xcite , we find that the electron density for day  55.71 is @xmath4  @xmath5 .",
    "assuming the mass - loss value given by obrien et al .",
    ", wind velocity 20  and shock velocity @xmath6  ( cf . fig .  [ vel_fwzi ] ) , the corresponding wind column , integrated from the base of the unshocked wind to infinity , is @xmath7  @xmath8 , in good agreement with that obtained from the x - ray data ( e.g. fig .  3 of bode et al .",
    "we can use the dereddened fluxes of the silicon coronal lines for 2006 april 9 to estimate the temperature in the coronal region .",
    "the relative fluxes for lines in a coronal gas are discussed by greenhouse et al .",
    "and we follow their analysis here , using collisional strengths from osterbrock and blaha , and ionization fractions as a function of temperature from shull & van steenberg .",
    "we find that the temperature of the coronal gas is @xmath9  k ( @xmath10  kev ) .",
    "we note that ness et al .",
    "deduced a temperature of a few @xmath11  k from the coronal x - ray lines in a chandra observation on jun 4.5 ; the temperature for the coronal gas obtained here is broadly consistent with the x - ray data .",
    "the deduced electron temperature , @xmath0  k , implies that the hydrogen ir emission on all three dates is primarily due to emission by the red giant wind , ionized by the ultraviolet flash when rs  oph  erupted .",
    "emission by the shocked wind must also contribute to the total emission ; however ir observational evidence for this is apparent only on day 55.71 with the clear development of the s and si coronal lines . as the shock propagates into , and eventually breaks out of , the wind ( which is predicted to occur around @xmath12  days ; see obrien , bode & kahn 1992 ) we expect that the contribution of the coronal gas will become dominant , and that of the cooler gas to decline and eventually disappear .",
    "while there exist at least two regions with greatly differing temperatures in the environment of rs  oph  the determination of abundances is problematic .",
    "however we anticipate that this will change when the shock breaks out of the giant wind .",
    "this next phase will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",

    "we have reported the early ir spectroscopy of the 2006 eruption of the recurrent nova rs  oph , covering the first 55  days .",
    "we find a spectrum dominated by hydrogen recombination lines arising from a gas at @xmath0  k ; silicon coronal lines prominent on day  55 , implying a temperature for the coronal gas of 930000  k.    ir ( and other ) observations of this remarkable object are continuing and in subsequent papers we will present contemporaneous observations carried out with ukirt and the spitzer space observatory .",
