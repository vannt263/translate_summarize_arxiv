    "long - range correlation studies between observables in two separated rapidity windows are considered @xcite as a tool for investigation of the initial stages of the hadronic and nuclear collisions , preceding the creation of a hot and dense medium .",
    "because of the non - perturbative nature of multiparticle production in a soft region , one has to apply the various semiphenomenological approaches , such as the model of quark - gluon string formation . at high energies , due to multiparton interactions",
    ", the formation of several pairs of strings becomes possible .",
    "the interaction between the strings could be observed as a collective phenomena in pp collisions .",
    "experimentally , the multiplicity correlation coefficient , defined as @xmath0 , has been measured in a wide energy range @xcite as a function of pseudorapidity windows width , their position and transverse momentum region . in the present paper ,",
    "we study @xmath1 using the monte carlo model , that incorporates string collectivity effects in the form of string fusion @xcite , and compare the results with the data at @xmath2 from 200 to 7000 gev .",
    "the monte carlo model @xcite is based on the partonic picture of nucleon interaction .",
    "it preserves the energy and angular momentum conservation in the nucleon initial state and uses the dipole approach @xcite for description of elementary partonic collisions .",
    "multiplicity and transverse momentum are obtained in the approach of colour strings , stretched between projectile and target partons .",
    "the interaction of strings is realized in accordance with the string fusion model prescriptions @xcite .",
    "namely the mean multiplicity @xmath3 and the mean transverse momentum @xmath4 of the particles produced from a cluster of @xmath5 overlapping strings are related to those ( @xmath6 ) from a single string : @xmath7{k } { p_t}_{1}.$ ] for realization of the string fusion prescription , we have used the discrete approach , in which a lattice with the cell area equal to the string transverse area @xmath8 is introduced .",
    "the strings are thought to be fused if their transverse position centres belong to the same cell . for the multiplicity from one string ( or a cluster of fused strings ) we used poisson distribution , with gaussian transverse momentum spectra of produced particles . however , in order to provide to provide the possibility of a direct comparison with experimental data , the correct description of the transverse momentum spectra is required . for this purpose",
    "the mc model @xcite has been extended by taking into account the hardness of elementary collision . for this",
    "the mechanism similar to the one in dipsy event generator @xcite , has been incorporated in our model with the string fusion .",
    "it was assumed that the hardness an elementary collision is inversely proportional to the transverse size of the interacting dipoles : @xmath9 the mean transverse momentum of particles produced by a single string has the contributions from both edges of the string plus the additional constant term @xmath10 , corresponding to the intrinsic string transverse momentum : @xmath11 .",
    "accordingly , in the version with string fusion , the transverse momentum of a cluster of strings : @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "parameters of the model are constrained from the data on total inelastic cross - section and multiplicity@xcite . in the present study , for the case with string fusion",
    "we have used @xmath14 ( in the case with string fusion ) . for the intrinsic string transverse momentum",
    "we have used @xmath15 , which provides a reasonable description of the transverse momentum distribution in pp collisions at the lhc energies .",
    ") at midrapidities ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "lines  the results of calculation in the model with and without string fusion , points  the experimental data @xcite.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]",
    "figure [ fig : mv ] shows the dependence of the correlation coefficient on the width of the pseudorapidity windows at three energies . the cuts on the transverse momentum ( @xmath17 ) applied in mc model calculations ,",
    "enable direct comparison with the alice experimental data @xcite .",
    "it was found that the general trends , like the growth of @xmath18 with collision energy and width of pseudorapidity windows ) are well described by the model .",
    "the role of string fusion raises with @xmath2 , but using only midrapidity experimental data on multiplicity correlation coefficient at present energies it is hard to distinguish between cases with and without string fusion . also , it should be noted that at the small gap between rapidity windows there is a contribution of short - range correlation effects in the data ( such as the decays of resonances ) , which are currently not accounted by the model .        in fig .",
    "2 the dependence of @xmath18 on the transverse momentum region of accounted particles is shown .",
    "the correlation coefficient is studied as the function of the lower bound of the @xmath19 interval , and compared to the atlas experimental data @xcite .",
    "the qualitative agreement of @xmath18 with experimental data is found .",
    "the increase of @xmath20 is accompanied by the decrease of the multiplicity in the given transverse momentum region , which restricts the phase space for particle production and the number of `` active '' strings , which leads to the decrease of correlation coefficient .",
    "numerically , the model calculations overestimate the value of the correlation coefficient in the hard transverse momentum area .",
    "it could be an indication that the direct approach with the soft strings is applicable at the @xmath19 region below @xmath21 , and different processes ( such as jet fragmentation ) begin playing a role at higher @xmath19 .",
    "on the other hand , this dependence is very sensitive to the shape of the transverse momentum spectra . whereas , the description of the @xmath19 spectra in our approach has an effective character and does not account the jet production and other hard phenomena accurately .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] shows the dependence of @xmath18 on the @xmath22 at four energies , calculated in the monte carlo model , with a comparison to the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the model calculations do not discriminate pp and @xmath23 scattering .",
    "the model reproduces the growth of the correlation coefficient with collision energy and qualitatively describes the decrease of the correlation coefficient with with increase of the gap between pseudorapidity windows .",
    "note that the short - range effects , such as the resonances decays and jets , which could contribute to the correlation coefficient at small @xmath22 are not accounted by the model .",
    "the results indicate that taking into account of the string fusion effects improves the agreement with the data .",
    "the forward - backward multiplicity correlation strength in pp collisions at high energy is studied in the monte carlo model with string formation and fusion .",
    "the monte carlo model reasonably describes the main features of the behaviour of the correlation coefficient in a wide energy range , such as general growth of the correlation coefficient with collision energy and with increase of pseudorapidity window size .",
    "the decrease of @xmath18 with the increase of the gap between windows and with increase of the lower @xmath24 bound is also qualitatively described .",
    "it is found that the version of the model with inclusion of string fusion effects is better supported by the data compared to the case without string fusion .",
