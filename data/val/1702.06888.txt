    "wave - particle duality is a salient feature of quantum mechanics and has primarily been observed through modern variations of thomas young s double slit experiments @xcite . when the paths are indistinguishable , multi - path interference results in fringes of high visibility ( @xmath0 ) in the far - field , which is a characteristic trait of wave - like behavior .",
    "conversely , if the paths are distinguishable ( @xmath1 ) , for example , through the use of which - path markers , the fringes disappear .",
    "the physical implications of this are embodied through the principle of complementarity @xcite , emphasizing the mutual exclusivity that exists between complimentary observables .",
    "the special case of @xmath2 and @xmath3 corresponds to a maximal observation of interference fringes while that of @xmath4 and @xmath5 corresponds to a full obtainment of the which - path information .",
    "intriguingly , it is permitted to have partial visibility and partial distinguishability , where the result can not be explained exclusively by a wave - like or particle - like interaction @xcite , and this may quantitatively be expressed @xmath6 .",
    "( @xmath7 ) , reduces the visibility of the fringes ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "interestingly , the path information can be erased with a complimentary projection with respect to the path markers of the double slit , reviving the interference fringes .",
    "scully and co - authors @xcite proposed such a device , the quantum eraser , which is now ubiquitous in experimental verifications of the complementarity principle .",
    "for example , in the double slit experiment presented in @xcite , a polariser is used to recover the interference pattern that is lost due to path distinguishability with circular polarisers . by orienting a polariser in a diagonal position ,",
    "the path information is erased .",
    "numerous other experiments have been performed with photonic systems using double slits @xcite , interferometers @xcite , and in measurement schemes @xcite .",
    "all these experiments have used physical paths to study the multi - path interference in the context of quantum erasers .",
    "here we generalise the concept of `` path '' , showing that it need not be a physical path in the sense of a route through space but an abstract `` path '' in any degree of freedom .",
    "we employ orbital angular momentum ( oam ) as our `` path '' and use polarisation as the `` which - path '' marker . to test this",
    "we create hybrid entanglement between photons carrying spin and orbital angular momentum and show control of the fringe visibility through a generalised quantum erasure experiment : the oam paths marked with polarization do not lead to interference , while introducing the eraser ( polarizer ) which projects the polarization of one of the entangled photons onto a complementary polarisation basis results in azimuthal fringes with high visibility .",
    "we perform this experiment in both the conventional quantum erasure and schemes , in both cases showing .",
    "our experimental results are in very good agreement with theory , offering a simple approach to illustrate the concept of path in quantum mechanics .",
    "it is instructive to revisit the concepts of the traditional quantum erasure experiment , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ( a ) , which we do here briefly for the benefit of the reader . consider a photon two unmarked slits , which can be represented by the following coherent superposition    @xmath9    @xmath10 to illustrate this , consider the schematic for a system that produces polarization entangled photons given by the following state ,    @xmath11    where the subscripts @xmath12 and @xmath13 label the entangled photons .",
    "inserting a double slit in the path of photon b , with each slit ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) marked with orthogonal linear polarizers yields    @xmath16    equation ( [ eq : sliteraser ] ) is a hybrid entangled state where the polarization of photon a is entangled with the slit ( path ) traversed by photon b. for example , measuring the state @xmath17 for photon a means that photon b traverses through slit @xmath14 , hence no interference fringes will be observed in the far - field of the double slit since there is path information in the system .",
    "however if photon a is projected onto the complimentary diagonal basis , \\{@xmath18 } , where , then the following projections hold    @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are projection operators associated with the states @xmath22 and @xmath23 , photon a. thus the projections of photon a onto complimentary polarization states collapses photon b into a coherent superposition the interference pattern .",
    "this means that the which - way path information of photon b has been erased .",
    "now photons carrying oam @xcite have attracted great interest in both classical and quantum studies @xcite . a transverse spatial distribution characterized by an azimuthal phase of @xmath24 such that each photon has an angular momentum of @xmath25 where the integer @xmath26 represents the twist or helicity of the phase profile . since oam of differing @xmath26",
    "are orthogonal , entanglement may be expressed in this basis where each oam subspace is spanned by @xmath27 .",
    "the distribution ( intensity distribution in classical light ) of the photons is symmetric and uniform in the azimuth for both basis states , each with an azimuthal helicity in phase of opposite sign .",
    "these properties allow oam to be treated as two paths , so that one may conceive an oam quantum eraser as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) .    to create an analogous quantum eraser for oam we require a hybrid entangled state of oam and polarisation . to generate the hybrid entanglement",
    ", we consider type i spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) as a source of entangled photons and employ geometric phase control of one of the entangled pairs using pancharatnam - berry phase to execute spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the quantum state of the photon pair produced from a type i spdc process is    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the probability of finding photon @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the state @xmath30 .",
    "the hybrid entanglement between photon a and b is obtained by using geometric phase control to perform an orbit - to - spin conversion in arm @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this may be done by using a @xmath31-plate @xcite , a wave - plate with a locally varying birefringence , that couples the polarization and oam dof of light according to    @xmath32    here @xmath33 and @xmath34 represent the left and right circular polarization states and @xmath31 is the charge of the @xmath31-plate .",
    "the @xmath31-plate inverts the circular polarization of a photon and imparts an oam variation of @xmath35 depending on the handedness of the input polarization . noting that and applying the transformation of the @xmath31-plate to photon a transforms eq .",
    "( [ eq : spdc1 ] ) to    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the transformation of the @xmath31-plate . coupling photon a into a single mode fiber imposes the condition @xmath38 on the entangled pair ( since the oam of a and b must now be zero ) .",
    "subsequently , @xmath39    where @xmath40 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : hybrid1 ] ) represents a maximally entangled bell state where the polarization dof of photon a is entangled with the oam degree of freedom of photon b , as desired .",
    "+ to obtain the oam information of photon b , the circular polarization of photon a is converted to linear polarization using a @xmath41 wave plate inserted after the @xmath31-plate and at @xmath42 with respect to the .",
    "therefore eq . ( [ eq : hybrid1 ] ) becomes    @xmath43    here @xmath44 is a relative phase after the transformation of the @xmath41 wave - plate .",
    "we note that the oam `` path '' is marked by polarisation .",
    "when one path is selected in this way , no interference appears .",
    "however , just as in the double slit case , a projection of the polarization of photon a onto a complimentary basis state with example for the @xmath45 subspace is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ( c ) . in this case",
    "the oam `` path '' information is erased .",
    "suppose the state of the hybrid entangled system is represented by eq .",
    "( [ eq : hybrid2 ] ) . a polarizer orientated at an angle @xmath46 ( with respect to the ) in arm a will project photon a onto the following target state    @xmath47    thus allowing the `` path '' to evolve from marked to unmarked by a judicious choice of @xmath46 .",
    "next , the visibility of fringes in arm b needs to be detected , which may easily be done with scanning detectors ( or more expensive camera - based systems ) .",
    "we instead make use of scanning holograms and a fixed detector as our pattern sensitive detector @xcite .",
    "we create sector states from superpositions of oam with a relative intermodal phase of @xmath48 :    @xmath49    the phase structure of @xmath50 is and allows a measurement of the path ( oam ) interference in arm b , analogous to detecting oam entanglement with bell - like measurements @xcite . thus the fringe pattern ( or lack thereof )",
    "can be detected by scanning through @xmath48 .",
    "the normalized probability of detection given the two projections is    @xmath51    @xmath52 is synonymous to the coincidence counts of the entangled pair .",
    "when the polarizer is orientated at @xmath53 , which corresponds to the @xmath17 polarization state , the probability distribution with respect to @xmath48 is a constant since the path is marked .",
    "conversely , for @xmath54 which corresponds to then @xmath55 and hence the oscillation is an indication of an interference pattern emerging from a superposition of the oam paths of photon b. therefore the which - path ( oam ) information has been erased .",
    "the fringe visibility is given by    @xmath56    the theoretical visibility of the interference fringes with respect to the angle of the polarizer ( @xmath46 ) is @xmath57 .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : fig2 ] ( a ) , we present the experimental set - up for our quantum eraser with polarization - oam hybrid entangled photons .",
    "a periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate ( ppktp ) nonlinear crystal , cut for type 1 phase matching , was pumped with a 100 mw coherent cube diode laser with a 450 nm nominal wavelength , producing entangled photon pairs at a wavelength of 810 nm .",
    "the spin - orbit conversion was achieved by inserting a @xmath31-plate creating polarisation - oam hybrid entanglement in the @xmath58 subspace . in this arrangement ,",
    "the state of the system is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : hybrid1 ] ) . to mark the states , a @xmath41 wave plate    ) in the range 0 to @xmath42 .",
    "similarly , * ( c ) * measurement results where the oam path is distinguished ( squares ) and erased ( circles ) , and subsequence measurements of the fringe visibility * ( d ) * with the polariser angle . in all panels experimental data is shown as symbols and theoretical calculations as dashed curves . ]",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ( a ) , confirming that no interference fringes were observed .",
    "the small oscillations are due to imperfections in the polarization filtering of photon a. the calculated visibility of the interference fringes is @xmath59 , in good agreement with the theoretical value of 0 .",
    "one can interpret this as photon b carrying a well defined amount oam , or equivalently , that the oam path is marked ( distinguished ) and thus visibility is zero .",
    "the oam path information was erased by performing a complimentary measurement of the polarization of photon a. we set the polarizer angle to .",
    "the coincidence counts from the azimuthal scanning are presented in fig.[fig : fig3 ] ( a ) , where interference fringes with a visibility of @xmath60 are observed , indicating that the path information has been erased , and equivalently , the oam of the photon .",
    "the detection probability function is consistent with the theory of eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob ] ) .",
    "next , the polarizer angle was varied in the range @xmath61 through @xmath62 with subsequent measurements of the spatial pattern .",
    "the visibility of the interference fringes with respect to the polarizer orientation was calculated from the measured data and is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ( b ) .",
    "the interference fringes are minimal at @xmath53 and maximal when @xmath63 , as expected .",
    "indeed , the polarizer controls the interference between the two oam paths with a visibility proportional to @xmath64 , as predicted by the theory .",
    "finally , we performed a variation of the quantum eraser by extending the path length of arm a by 2.3 m , with the experimental results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "the same procedures were used to mark the oam paths and to erased the path information . the visibility with respect to the variation of the polarizer angle was calculated and presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ( d ) , showing a range from @xmath65 to @xmath66 , in good agreement with theory .",
    "complementarity between path information and fringe visibility is essential to the quantum eraser . by defining the two distinct paths using the oam dof , we have shown that through polarisation - oam hybrid entanglement",
    ", it is possible to distinguish ( @xmath67 ) and erase ( @xmath68 ) the oam path information of a photon through the polarisation control of its entangled twin .",
    "our work is consistent with previous studies using entanglement and linear momentum of light @xcite , as well as with angular fringes observed with weak classical light @xcite , both of which used physical paths rather than abstract paths for the path interference .",
    "our experiment highlights the extent to which information is made available to an observer through a variation of the quantum eraser , where the analysis of the fringe pattern occurs before the decision to mark the paths ( or not ) is made .",
    "indeed , we distinguished ( @xmath65 ) and erased ( @xmath66 ) the oam path information , showing that causality does not play a role in the outcome path interference , which is a non - classical property of quantum mechanics . furthermore , mutual exclusivity between the visibility and path information was demonstrated by varying the amount of oam path information present in the system .",
    "significantly , our scheme shows the important role of hybrid entanglement which has been discussed previously as the main aspect of the quantum eraser @xcite . abstracting the path to oam , with all the versatile tools that come with this choice of path , may provide the possibility of finding new approaches for studies in quantum information and communication .",
    "while we note that in principle any degree of freedom may be used , oam is an attractive choice due to the possibility to explore the impact of dimensionality in such systems , given that it offers an infinitely large hilbert space in which to operate .",
    "finally , our scheme contrasts previous reports that rely primarily on traditional path - phase interferometric methods , overcoming the sensitivity and complexity of such experiments .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that the oam of a photon may be treated as an abstract path , reminiscent of a slit .",
    "using oam - polarization hybrid entanglement , we have shown that , just as in the double slit quantum eraser , the oam information of a photon that is marked with orthogonal polarizations can be erased through the polarization control of a bi - photon twin , both in the conventional scheme and in a type arrangement . in both schemes",
    "the fringe visibility increases with a reduction in the oam path information .",
