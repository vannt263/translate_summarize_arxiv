    "the slowing down of the dynamics in a supercooled liquid near the kinetic glass transition still requires a complete molecular understanding though recent progress has been made by experiments@xcite , by computer simulations @xcite and theory @xcite .",
    "the inherent polydispersity of colloidal systems facilitates the formation of disordered arrested states , as compared to the formation of the underlying equilibrium crystal @xcite . in simulations , it is difficult to vitrify a pure one - component system of spherical particles due to the onset of crystallization , so that binary mixtures constitute a much richer and more convenient system to study the glass transition @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamically stable state of an homogeneous undercooled binary melt typically involves two phase - separated binary crystals , a - rich and b - rich @xcite or a complex alloy in which the two components are mixed @xcite . in either case , the processes involved to reach true thermodynamic equilibrium require collective , mutually coordinated motions that take enormously long time .",
    "therefore , the glass transition does take place also in simulation , since crystallization is prevented by the inherent polydispersity of the mixture .",
    "hence , either binary or polydisperse systems have always been used as prototype models for the glass transition , for example repulsive soft spheres @xcite or lennard - jones mixtures @xcite , charged mixtures @xcite , hard spheres @xcite , and yukawa systems @xcite .",
    "in fact , the main reason for considering these _ slightly asymmetric _ binary mixtures is that crystallization was avoided .",
    "upon cooling down typically all species freeze into a glass at the same temperature .",
    "more recently , insight has been gained into the glass transition of _ strongly asymmetric _ mixtures consisting of large colloidal spheres and small additives such as smaller colloids or non - adsorbing polymers which induce an effective depletion attraction between the large particles whose range is dictated by the size of the small particles . for strong asymmetries , very short range attractions ( relative to the core size of the large particles ) can thus be realized .",
    "a new type of glass was observed for these attractive interactions  termed an _ attractive _ glass  in experiments of colloid - polymer mixtures @xcite and in computer simulations @xcite , following predictions based on mode coupling theory @xcite .",
    "there is an interesting reentrant behavior @xcite for increasing concentration of the additives : the _ repulsive glass _ ( at vanishing additive concentration , i.e. in the absence of any attraction ) melts upon a threshold additive concentration .",
    "the resulting melt revitrifies into a second type of glass , namely the _ attractive glass _ , for higher additive concentrations .",
    "both for repulsive and attractive glass , only the large particles freeze into a disordered glassy matrix while the small additives always remain mobile and stay in a fluid state occupying the `` holes '' within the glassy matrix .",
    "this has been made explicit by computer simulations and mode coupling theory for the asakura - oosawa model in which the polymer - polymer interaction is assumed to be ideal .",
    "it was found @xcite that the bare mobility of the additives is very important : when it is comparable to that of the colloids there is a freezing into a common glassy matrix of colloids and additives , while when it is much larger than the one of the colloids , freezing involves only the colloid component .",
    "experiments on binary hard sphere mixtures @xcite have shown that there is a geometrically - inspired cross - over behavior in the dynamics of the small spheres when the ratio @xmath0 of the two spheres diameter is about 0.15 .",
    "this is well below the size asymmetry considered in earlier mode - coupling calculations @xcite .",
    "another system in which dynamical arrest has been studied theoretically and experimentally are star polymers and micellar solutions @xcite .",
    "the first systematic attempt to vary the size asymmetry and to monitor its influence on the glass transition was performed in a binary mixture of star polymers in a good solvent @xcite .",
    "mode coupling theory and experimental data were compared for different size ratios @xmath0 of the star polymer species . at low @xmath0",
    "the small additives remain ergodic in the glassy matrix formed by the large stars ( _ single glass _ ) while at high @xmath0 both species become arrested simultaneously ( _ double glass _ ) .    for increasing concentration of the smaller star polymers a melting into a fluid",
    "was found . the threshold concentration of the smaller stars for melting behaves non - monotonically as a function of @xmath0 for fixed concentration of the big stars with a @xmath3-type shape .",
    "this non - monotonicity is a result of the ultrasoft effective interactions between the star polymers @xcite and has no counterpart in hard - sphere based systems .",
    "additive induced melting has also been found in mixtures of star polymers and liner polymer chains @xcite .",
    "more recently , a detailed study of the structural properties at high densities of the additives was performed @xcite and an additional double glass , called _ asymmetric glass _ , has been identified .    in the present paper",
    "we elaborate more on the system of binary star polymers .",
    "our motivation to do so is twofold : firstly , aiming at a deeper understanding of the full dynamical behavior of collective- and self - correlations close to the various glass transitions , we performed extensive molecular dynamics computer simulations and compared the results with predictions of mode coupling theory calculations . in this fashion",
    ", we were able to extract the dynamical scaling laws by fitting the simulation data . as regards the arrested plateau values of the dynamical correlations and localization lengths of both large and small components we find quantitative agreement between simulations and mct",
    "secondly , we have expanded the parameter space up to concentrations of added small stars higher than previously studied @xcite and found a reentrant vitrification of the molten state @xcite . in the plane of size asymmetry @xmath0 and added concentration @xmath1 the molten state formes a lake with an @xmath4-shape .",
    "in addition to the asymmetric glass , we also observe an attractive glass at low @xmath0 and high @xmath1 , which is unstable with respect to phase separation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the theoretical methods used in this paper .",
    "iii contains the results based on mode coupling theory , where we distinguish four regions in the @xmath5 plane .",
    "simulation data for the glass transition line based on iso - diffusivity curves are presented in sec .",
    "iv , whereas simulation data for the dynamical correlations in the four different regions are subsequently discussed in sec .",
    "v. finally , in sec .",
    "vi we summarize and present our conclusions .",
    "we describe the system in terms of effective interactions between the star centers @xcite .",
    "the monomer degrees of freedom have been traced out in this approach .",
    "this method is applicable to the problem at hand , because we are interested in the arrest of the stars as whole objects and not in the arrest of the monomers themeslves , which occurs at much higher concentrations .",
    "concomitantly , the monomers maintain their fluctuating nature throughout .",
    "however , possible entanglements of the arms are not included in this description .",
    "the effective interaction between star centers depends parametrically on the number of arms ( or functionality ) @xmath6 , and shows a logarithmic divergence when the two stars overlap within their corona diameters @xmath7 , @xmath8,(where @xmath9 @xcite , with @xmath10 the hydrodynamic radius ) , followed by a yukawa - tail for larger separations @xcite .",
    "in this work we study binary star mixtures with functionalities @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",

    "attractive glass / phase separation .",
    "preliminary information on the single , double and asymmetric glasses have been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we summarize the most important aspects for completeness .",
    "we start by examining region i. the small stars always remain liquid in this regime , even in those states in which the large ones are arrested ( single glass ) @xcite .",
    "the addition of small stars with size ratio up to @xmath90 causes the large glass star to melt due to a depletion - induced softening of the repulsions with respect to the one - component case @xcite , weakening the stability of the cages @xcite .    on the other hand , moving into region ii by increasing the small stars diameter , the addition of a second component of stars with @xmath91 leads to a glassy state formed by both components ( double glass ) @xcite . here",
    ", an increase of @xmath1 also melts the glass but through an entirely different mechanism , found in mct and also confirmed by experiments @xcite .",
    "indeed , the glass becomes stiffer through the addition of a second glassy component , as shown by the growth of the elastic modulus in theory and experiments reported in @xcite up to the melting density . at this point",
    ", it becomes entropically more convenient to free available volume for both stars simultaneously , which amounts to a finite energetic increase , sufficient to cause liquification .",
    "therefore , this melting mechanism is only possible through the softness of interactions involved , and it does not have an equivalent in terms of hard - sphere mixtures .",
    "we note , that the presence of two different glasses for asymmetric mixtures , a single to a double glass , depending on the size ratio , was already found for hard spheres @xcite , but the new feature of the presently investigated soft mixtures is that both glasses can be simultaneously melted by increasing the amount of the small additives in the mixture .",
    "clearly , a theoretical framework capable to correctly describe the single glass should be based on the slowing down of the large stars only , i.e.  one - component mct , where the smaller stars are assumed to form a fluid medium that does not participate in the glass formation , is the conceptually right framework to use . on the other hand , in the double glass",
    "both species become comparably slow , thus compelling the use of binary mct .",
    "it turns out that in the case of star polymers mixtures , differently from that of colloid - polymer mixtures @xcite , at low @xmath0 , i.e. , in the single glass regime , both treatments give qualitatively the same behavior , as illustrated also in figure [ fig : mctphase ] , while at large @xmath0 , in the double glass regime , the discrepancy becomes large , signaling the tendency of the small component to also arrest .",
    "only binary mct can be used in this region , giving rise to the u - shape also observed in the experiments for low @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "hence , in the following we just refer to two - component mct in all regions , unless explicitly mentioned .    in the present work we complement previous results @xcite with the investigation of regions iii and iv . in region iii , for large concentration of additives with @xmath92 , we find a reentrant vitrification with respect to @xmath1 , with the appearance of a new glassy state with smaller localization length for large @xmath0 and large @xmath1 . due to the softness of the interactions local rearrangements",
    "take place which leads to a change of coordination of the large stars as well as to an asymmetric deformation of the cages @xcite .",
    "the increase of @xmath1 causes a second jamming at a new length scale that will depend on the particular parameters of the mixture .",
    "finally in region iv , at low @xmath0 , the depletion mechanism induces effective attractions between the large stars @xcite , causing phase separation .",
    "phase separation is accompanied by an increase of the structure factor at infinite wavelength , and a blind use of it in the mode - coupling equations would predict glass formation driven by the small wavevectors .",
    "however , with the use of ry structure factors , we are only able to find a glass within binary mct for @xmath93 , while the one - component treatment always provides a liquid state up to the maximum investigated @xmath1 approaching phase separation .",
    "we could not extend the analysis to larger @xmath1 due to a breakdown in the convergence of the rogers - young closure , as well as the simplest hnc closure in this region , a possible sign of a close thermodynamic instability .     of the large stars in the single and double glass",

    "thus , although , in binary mct the broken ergodicity transition is postulated to happen simultaneously for both species , the self non - ergodicity parameter allows to distinguish between mobile and immobile species .",
    "also , the partial @xmath99 for both types of stars have a larger width in the asymmetric glass than in the double glass .",
    "fitting @xmath99 to a gaussian curve @xmath100 provides an estimate for the localization length @xmath101 within the glass .",

    "the extracted localization length is @xmath102 for large stars both in single and double glass , while it is @xmath103 for the asymmetric glass , i.e. , the cage size reduces by a factor of two .",
    "a larger variation in @xmath101 is predicted for the small stars from @xmath104 for the double glass at low @xmath1 to @xmath105 for the asymmetric glass at high @xmath1 , a value which is almost identical to the one for the large stars in the same state . for the collective @xmath106 ,",
    "the results are very similar to those of the self non - ergodicity parameters , only much stronger oscillation peaks are observed in phase with the static structure factor . for the small stars ,",
    "these appear only in the asymmetric glass regime .",
    "we notice that upon changes in @xmath0 within the low @xmath1 glasses , we detect no change in @xmath41 between single and double glass .",
    "however , a significant increase is observed for large @xmath0 , upon increasing @xmath1 , while approaching the asymmetric glass .",
    "this increase results in a more extended @xmath67-width in @xmath41 , a finding similar to that for attractive glasses in colloid - polymer mixtures , where further increase of the additives leads to an increase of the non - ergodicity parameter both in amplitude and range @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the asymmetric regime , a strong localizing mechanism is at hand , with some similarities to an effective attraction .",
    "however , looking at the partial @xmath107 we do not see an increase in the compressibilities or a non - monotonic dependence in the growth of peaks .",
    "simply , the structure factor peaks for large stars continue to decrease upon addition of small stars , while these display themselves more and more enhanced peaks . in @xcite ,",
    "we have shown that the change of structure is accompanied by a dramatic decrease in the coordination number of the large stars and an asymmetric deformation of the large star cages .",
    "finally , an analysis of the mct exponents reveals that , for both single and double glass , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , the same result obtained for one - component star polymer solutions .",
    "however , we note that @xmath77 grows considerably close to the asymmetric glass transition . at the transition",

    "( [ eq : pot ] ) . although the use of brownian dynamics simulations would be more realistic for star - star mixtures to mimic the solvent effects , this is less efficient and it would not allow us to probe the full slow dynamics regime efficiently .",
    "moreover , several confirmations of independence of long - time properties from microscopic dynamics have been provided so far @xcite for systems close to their glass line .",
    "we investigate several compositions , in order to have a complete picture of the phase diagram and of the dynamical slowing down . due to the various compositions to be investigated",

    "to improve statistics , we average over 5 independent runs for each studied state point .    in order to describe the dynamics of the system properly",

    "this results in a ratio between the small and large particles mass equal to @xmath121 .",
    "note that a physical choice of the small particle mass is crucial , since as already noticed in earlier simulations of explicit colloid - polymer mixtures @xcite , the addition of small particles of mass identical to the one of the large particles , has the result of further slowing down the large particle dynamics .",

    "simulations for the isodiffusivity lines are performed for @xmath86 .",
    "note however that at this density the slowing down of the dynamics observed in the simulations is not very significant .",
    "to study the dynamics on approaching the glass transition(s ) we have been forced to increase the density of the large particles to generate a slower dynamics .",
    "indeed , similarly to other studied cases like that of hard spheres , a systematic shift of the mct transition with respect to the slowing down taking place in experiments or simulations , is present .",
    "this shift usually applies in the direction of mct anticipating the onset of glassy dynamics and our findings agree with this general picture .",
