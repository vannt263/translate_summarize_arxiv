    "elastoplastic processes describe behaviour of solid continuum beyond reversible elastic deformations .",
    "they are typically described by hysteresis models with a time memory @xcite .",
    "the rigorous mathematical analysis of elastoplastic problems and the numerical methods for their solution started to appear in the late 70ies and in the early 80ies by the work of c. johnson @xcite , h. matthies @xcite , v. korneev and u. langer @xcite , j. neas and i. hlavek @xcite and others .",
    "since then a lot of mathematical contributions to computational plasticity have been written , we refer at least to the monographs by j. simo and t. hughes @xcite and w. han and b. reddy @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the efficient parallel implementation of elastoplastic problems based on the tfeti domain decomposition method @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we consider an associated elastoplasticity with the von mises plastic criterion and the linear isotropic hardening law ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding elastoplastic constitutive model is discretized by the implicit euler method in time and consequently a nonlinear stress - strain relation is implemented by the return mapping concept ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this approach together with the balance equation , the small strain assumption and a combination of the dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions leads to the solution of a nonlinear variational equation with respect to the primal unknown displacement in each time step .",
    "such an equation can also be equivalently formulated as a minimization problem with a potential energy functional ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    by a finite element space discretization of the one time step problem",
    ", we obtain a system of nonlinear equations .",
    "the corresponding nonlinear operator is nondifferentiable but strongly semismooth .",
    "therefore , it is suitable to choose the semismooth newton method for solving the system since the strong semismoothness together with other properties ensure local quadratic convergence .",
    "semismooth functions in finite dimensional spaces and the semismooth newton method were introduced in @xcite . in elastoplasticity",
    ", the semismoothness was investigated for example in @xcite .    in each newton iteration , it is necessary to solve the respective linearized problem . different linear solvers including those based on multigrid",
    "have been successfully tested in @xcite . moreover , since the linear systems of equations corresponding to the elastic and elastoplastic problems are spectrally equivalent @xcite , all preconditioners for elastic problems can be applied to elastoplastic ones as well .",
    "a linear solver considered in this paper is based on a feti type domain decomposition method enabling its efficient parallel implementation .",
    "the standard feti method ( feti-1 ) was originally introduced by farhat and roux @xcite and theoretically analyzed by mandel and tezaur @xcite .",
    "a systematic overview of using this approach , a body is partitioned into non - overlapping subdomains , an elliptic problem with neumann boundary conditions is defined for each subdomain , and intersubdomain field continuity is enforced via lagrange multipliers .",
    "the lagrange multipliers are efficiently solved from a dual problem by a variant of the conjugate gradient algorithm .",
    "the first practical implementations exploited only the favorable distribution of the spectrum of the matrix of the smaller problem @xcite , known also as the dual schur complement matrix , but such algorithm was efficient only with a small number of subdomains .",
    "later , farhat , mandel , and roux introduced a `` natural coarse problem '' whose solution was implemented by auxiliary projectors so that the resulting algorithm became in a sense optimal @xcite . here",
    ", we use the total - feti ( tfeti ) @xcite variant of feti domain decomposition method , where even the dirichlet boundary conditions are enforced by lagrange multipliers .",
    "hence all subdomain stiffness matrices are singular with a - priori known kernels which is a great advantage in the numerical solution . with known kernel basis",
    "we can regularize effectively the stiffness matrix without extra fill in and use any standard sparse cholesky type decomposition method for nonsingular matrices @xcite .    for systematic overview of domain decomposition methods we refer to @xcite .",
    "we mention feti - dp and bddc methods as examples of alternatives to the total - feti method .",
    "the feti - dp ( dual - primal feti ) is a popular way of avoiding singular stiffness matrices of the local problems and was first introduced by farhat , lesoinne , le tallec , pierson , and rixen @xcite . on the other hand , in @xcite we gave numerical examples showing that the matrices of the systems arising in tfeti may be better conditioned than those arising in feti - dp .",
    "more theoretical and implementation details about feti - dp and its extensions and improvements are given in @xcite .",
    "the bddc ( balancing domain decomposition by constraints ) was introduced by dohrmann @xcite as a simpler primal alternative to the feti - dp .",
    "the name of the method was coined by mandel and dohrmann @xcite , because it can be understood as further development of the bdd ( balancing domain decomposition ) method @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to the solution of elastoplastic problems based on the schwarz domain decomposition method with overlap was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section 2 , we introduce a quasistatic scheme of a solid mechanics problem . within this context",
    ", we consider both elastic and elastoplastic models .",
    "the elastic model is introduced for methodical purposes because it is an essential part of the investigated elastoplastic model .",
    "after its time discretization we summarize the resulting one time step problem . in section 3 ,",
    "the finite element space discretization of the one time step problem and its nonlinear algebraic formulation are described in details .",
    "the semismooth newton method is applied to treat this nonlinearity .",
    "the tfeti method combined with the projected conjugate gradient algorithm is derived in section 4 to solve the linearized problems appearing in the newton iterations .",
    "finally , the algorithm for solving the whole elastoplastic problem is summarized . in section 5 , the performance of the proposed algorithm is illustrated on numerical experiments .",
