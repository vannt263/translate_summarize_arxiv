    "later , topology optimization was applied to directly design micro - electro - mechanical systems ( mems ) , utilizing the ability of thin - film fabrication techniques , such as photolithography in combination with chemical etching , to create geometrically complex devices at low cost @xcite . as the mems design problem is essentially two - dimensional , traditional approaches were sufficient to achieve the necessary geometric resolution at acceptable computational cost .",
    "motivated by the availability of affordable additive fabrication methods for three dimensional structures , this paper focuses on topology optimization of three dimensional structures and introduces a new approach for finding optimized designs with high geometric resolution on rather coarse computational meshes .",
    "most approaches for structural topology optimization are density methods .",
    "for a two - phase problem , the density is considered a design variable and can assume intermediate values between the density of the material phase `` a '' and the density of the material phase `` b '' .",

    "often this issue can be mitigated by mesh refinement or adaptive re - meshing @xcite .",
    "however , for problems that require an accurate description of the boundaries , such as boundary layer problems in fluids and skin - depth issues in electromagnetics , it was reported that density methods like simp fail @xcite .",

    "@xcite used a standard enrichment strategy to discretize the phonon boltzmann transport equation and optimize the thermal conductivity of nano - composites .",
    "however , this enrichment strategy is not guaranteed to consistently approximate the state variable fields for configurations with complex intersection patterns .    an enhanced version of the xfem was proposed by @xcite , who presented a generalized enrichment based on the step enrichment of @xcite and applied it to two dimensional structural topology optimization .",

    "in topology optimization , the geometry of a body is defined via its material distribution . in density methods , such as simp",
    ", the material distribution is discretized by finite elements , with either elemental or nodal parameters defining the distribution within the element .",
    "most often the same mesh is used to approximate the density distribution and the structural response .",
    "alternatively , the state and density fields can be discretized by different meshes with different refinement levels ; see for example the multi - resolution topology method ( mtop ) by @xcite .",
    "the optimization variables define analytically or by means of auxiliary partial differential equations the nodal or element density parameters @xcite . for two - phase problems",
    ", the density is continuously varied between `` 0 '' ( phase `` a '' ) and `` 1 '' ( phase `` b '' ) .",
    "implicit or explicit penalization schemes , optionally combined with projection methods , are used to encourage `` 0 - 1 '' solutions @xcite .",
    "the crispness of the interface geometry , as described via the optimized material distribution , depends on ( a ) the formulation of the optimization problem , i.e.  the objective and constraints , ( b ) regularization techniques , such as density or sensitivity filters , and ( c ) the optimization algorithm . in general",
    ", the resolution of the phase boundaries increases as the mesh is refined . for three dimensional problems ,",
    "often coarse meshes are used to limit the computational costs . in this case",
    ", the boundary geometry either lacks crispness due to the presence of elements with intermediate densities or is approximated by a spatially discontinuous material distribution , leading to jagged interfaces .",
    "alternatively , the material distribution can be described via a level set function @xmath0 .",
    "typically the zero level set contour defines the phase boundaries .",
    "considering a two - phase problem , the interface @xmath1 is defined as follows :    @xmath2    where the vector @xmath3 collects the spatial coordinates , @xmath4 is the domain of material phase `` a '' , @xmath5 is the domain of material phase `` b '' , and @xmath1 defines the material interface between phase `` a '' and phase `` b '' . for example , to model a sphere in a three dimensional mesh centered at ( @xmath6,@xmath7,@xmath8 ) , the value of the level set function at a grid point ( @xmath9,@xmath10,@xmath11 ) is :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 represents the radius of the sphere , and the sign value of @xmath14 at each node determines if the node is inside or outside the circle .    the level set field is typically discretized by shape functions with either local or global support ; the reader is referred to the review paper by @xcite . in the simplest and most common approach",
    ", the level - set field is approximated on the same mesh used for discretizing the governing equations . in this study",
    ", we follow this approach and define the nodal level - set values explicitly as functions of the optimization variables ( see [ sec : optimization - xfem ] ) .",
    "the resulting parameter optimization problem is solved by a standard nonlinear programming method .    while lsms provide a crisp definition of the phase boundaries , they require seeding the initial design with inclusions and/or introducing inclusions in the course of the optimization process , for example via topological derivatives @xcite .",

    "this layout can be generated by superposing eq .",
    "[ eqn : circle ] for spheres at uniformly spaced center locations .",
    "the optimization results of the lsm are typically dependent on the initial layout .",
    "furthermore , it is non - trivial to generate an initial design that satisfies geometric design constraints , such as volume or perimeter constraints . in our experience , severe constraint violations may cause the optimization process to converge to a feasible design with otherwise poor performance .",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss the structural model and the xfem analysis used in this paper .",

    "a similar approach can be applied to the xfem to suppress singularities by modeling the `` void '' phase via a soft material @xcite .",

    "this enrichment strategy will be revisited in section [ sec : computational - considerations ] .",
    "the heaviside function @xmath45 depends on the level set function and is defined as follows :    @xmath47    the heaviside functions `` turns on / off '' the standard finite element interpolations in the particular phases .",
    "the approximation ( [ eq : xfem - interp ] ) allows for discontinuities of the displacements along the phase boundaries . therefore the continuity is enforced weakly via the stabilized lagrange multiplier method ( [ eq : stabilized_residual ] ) .",
