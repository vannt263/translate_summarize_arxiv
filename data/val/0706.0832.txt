    "the first type i x - ray bursting sources were discovered with sas 3 @xcite and oso-8 @xcite . @xcite and",
    "@xcite independently discussed the origin of the phenomenon : type i x - ray bursts are explained by thermonuclear flashes of the material accreting from the companion star on the surface of the neutron star .",
    "all x - ray sources showing type i bursts are low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "the proprieties and the theory of the x - ray bursts are discussed in the review of @xcite .",
    "the x - ray burster ks 1741 - 293 was firstly reported by @xcite as one of the two new transient sources near the galactic centre ( gc ) detected during the observations performed with the x - ray wide - field camera ttm on board the kvant module of the mir space station .",
    "ks 1741 - 293 was detected , on 3 consecutive days in the energy range 5.7@xmath027.2 kev , during which it exhibited two type i x - ray bursts .",
    "ks 1741 - 293 may be identified with either mxb 1743 - 29 and mxb 1742 - 29 , two bursting sources detected in 1976 with sas-3 .",
    "the single peak burst profile excludes the identification of ks 1741 - 293 with mxb 1743 - 29 @xcite .",
    "therefore ks 1741 - 293 and mxb 1742 - 29 are likely to be the same source . in the bepposax era ( 1996 - 2002 ) , ks 1741 - 293 was detected , together with a large sample of galactic sources , during the wide field camera ( wfc ) monitoring of the gc region @xcite at a peak flux of the order of 30 mcrab in the 2 - 28 kev energy range . from the medium energy concentrator spectrometer ( mecs , on board bepposax )",
    "observations , @xcite report a 2 - 10 kev luminosity of the source @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 and 10@xmath3 erg s@xmath2 ( corrected for absorption ) on september 1997 and march 1998 , respectively , assuming a distance of 8.5 kpc .",
    "ks 1741 - 293 was also detected by asca during 107 pointing observations of a @xmath4 deg@xmath5 region around the gc showing an apparent variability by a factor of 50 , while on the contrary no burst has been found @xcite .",
    "no hard x - ray detection has been reported by the first gamma - ray imager sigma on board the granat satellite and indeed the source is not in the hard x - ray sigma catalogue , covering the 40 - 100 kev range @xcite .",
    "ks 1741 - 293 is listed in the batse / cgro instrument deep sample as one of the 179 sources monitored along the cgro operative life @xcite even though it is not a firm detection .",
    "ks 1741 - 293 is reported in the third ibis catalogue @xcite at a significance level of 67 sigma with a flux of ( @xmath6 ) mcrab in the 20 - 40 kev band .",
    "recently an x - ray burst has been reported from ks 1741 - 293 with ibis / isgri in the 15 - 25 kev band by @xcite .",
    "it occurred on march 30 , 2004 .",
    "a search for optical , infrared and radio counterparts was made by @xcite without finding a firm candidate .",
    "a chandra source inside all the ks 1741 - 293 high energy error circles has been proposed by @xcite as a possible counterpart .",
    "these authors discuss also a possible association with a non - thermal radio nebula that could be the supernova remnant produced by the accretion induced collapse in the binary system .",
    "however this association is still under debate due to the estimated age ( about 500 years ) of the snr , which is very low for a lmxb .    in this work",
    "we show that , within february 2003 and may 2005 , ks 1741 - 293 has been clearly detected in the hard x energy band ( @xmath7 kev ) with the ibis imager during two visibility periods , while during the other observations it appears to be in a quiescent status . using the combined data from the x - ray monitor jem - x and the ibis hard x telescope , we obtain in the second period of visibility the wide band x - ray spectrum from about 5 kev to 100 kev . we show for the first time the soft component simultaneously with the hard tail for this source . we report also the detection of two bursts with jem - x and their temporal and spectral properties .    in section  2 we show the observations and the data analysis tools . in section ",
    "3 we present the data analysis results from : flux monitoring , spectral analysis and x - ray burst analysis .",
    "finally the conclusions are summarised in section  4 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,>,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : table2 ]    the ibis / isgri average spectrum has been extracted in the 20 - 150 kev energy range during the two periods corresponding to source detection , namely period 1 and period 3 ( see table [ tab : table1 ] ) .",
    "we fitted the extracted spectra with a simple power law , a cut - off power law and a comptonized model with xspec ( v.11.3.2 ) . during period 1",
    "we find that all these models provide a good agreement with the data , with a marginal evidence of improvement by using the cut - off power law or a comptonized model ( the probability of a chance improvement in @xmath8 is @xmath9 using the f - test ) . during period 3 , the increased statistics due to the longer exposure than for period 1 ,",
    "enable us to confidently exclude a simple power law model ( with reduced @xmath10 with 5 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "we obtain a comparable good fit good fit with a cut - off power law ( @xmath11 ) and with a comptonized model ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "we find no evidence of spectral variability between period 1 and period 3 in the 20 - 150 kev energy range .    in order to constrain the model parameters",
    ", we extended our spectral analysis to low energies of 4 kev thanks to the simultaneous detection with jem - x during period 3 .",
    "analysis at low energies of this source have already been performed by @xcite with bepposax / mecs observations taken on the 31st of march 1998 . from their analysis ,",
    "the 2 - 10 kev spectrum was equally well modelled by a simple power law , a thermal bremmstrahlung and a black body .",
    "interestingly , in the two former cases , high photoelectric absorption was required by the data , with an equivalent hydrogen column density @xmath12 of a few @xmath13@xmath14 .",
    "we then performed a simultaneous analysis of the jem - x and ibis / isgri spectra on the basis of the previous results .",
    "a constant normalisation factor has been introduced in the fitting models in order to take into account the systematic errors in the knowledge of the absolute jem - x and ibis / isgri inter - calibration .",
    "we find that , assuming a cut - off power - law model at high energies , none of the previous models used to fit the low energies ( sidoli et al .",
    "1999 ) can fit the jem - x data . on the contrary , a multicolor disk blackbody component ( diskbb in xspec ) , typically invoked to model",
    "the emission from an accretion disk , provides a good fit to the data .",
    "the available statistics do not allow us to disentangle among a cut - off power - law or a comptonized model at high energies , thus we obtained similar results also assuming a comptonized model .",
    "at the same time , we were able to confidently exclude a simple power law model ( with @xmath15 ) rather than a cut - off power - law or a comptonized model .",
    "the best fit model parameters from these analysis are summarised in table 2 .",
    "we also compared the 2 - 10 kev flux obtained on march 1998 from the bepposax / mecs observations ( sidoli et al . 1999 ) with our estimate from the best fit models in the same energy range .",
    "we find a 2 - 10 kev flux of @xmath16 @xmath14 s@xmath2 that is consistent with the previous measure .    assuming the distance of 8.5 kpc for this source",
    "as quoted by @xcite , we computed the source luminosity from the flux measured during the period 3 in the 20 - 100 kev energy band as 1.7 @xmath17 @xmath18 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "two x - ray bursts from ks 1741 has been detected in the 4 - 15 kev band by the jem - x telescope during the integral revolution 53 ( march 22 2003 ) and 63 ( april 22 2003 ) . on the instrument image of the first burst ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : image_jemx ] ) we have superimposed the ibis position as it is reported with good accuracy ( 0.6 arcmin 90% error circle ) in the survey of @xcite . note that the jem - x position accuracy ( 3 arcmin 90% error circle ) is lower then the ibis ones due to shorter exposure time .",
    "as the jem - x position of ks 1741 - 293 , obtained during the x - ray burst , is in agreement with ibis , the burst is firmly associated to our source .",
    "the one - second resolved light curves obtained from jem - x data exhibit two x - ray bursts in the energy range 4 - 15 kev , one in revolution 53 ( science window 58 ) and the other in revolution 63 ( science window 92 ) .",
    "both bursts lasted around 20 s , with a maximum flux of 1.3 and 2.1 crab respectively .",
    "the burst morphology ( fig .",
    "[ fig : time_jemx ] ) confirms previous observations with a single peaked time profile unlike double peaked time profile reported for mxb 1743 - 29 @xcite .",
    "the jem - x spectra during the bursts have been extracted selecting the good time intervals ( gti ) 1176.359 - 1176.360 and 1207.4116 - 1297.4120 ijd for the @xmath19 and @xmath20 bursts respectively .",
    "both spectra have been fitted with a black body model ( fig .",
    "6 ) , with a temperature kt@xmath21 equal to @xmath22 kev for the first burst and @xmath23 kev for the second one at 90 % of confidence level . the 4 - 20 kev fluxes are 3.6 @xmath17 @xmath24 erg @xmath14 s@xmath2 and 1.1 @xmath17 @xmath25 erg @xmath14 s@xmath2 , respectively . assuming a distance of 8.5 kpc , the radius of the first and the second bursts are @xmath26 km and @xmath27 km respectively .",
    "the burst emission is not detected by ibis .",
    "this   lack of high   energy ( @xmath28 20 kev ) detection can be explained by the soft spectrum of the source emission during the burst activity and by the short exposure .",
    "indeed , taking into account the ibis sensitivity , we estimate a 2 sigma flux upper limit of 140 mcrab in the 20 - 40 kev energy band for a 20 seconds exposure ( i.e. the burst time interval ) . extrapolating the jem - x burst spectrum we   obtain in this band a flux of 9 mcrab and 7 mcrab for the first and the second burst respectively .",
    "these values are significantly below the ibis 20 seconds upper limit .",
    "despite ks 1741 - 293 being reported for the first time many years ago @xcite , this source was poorly studied , in particular at high energies .",
    "this is mainly due to the source faintness , both in the soft and hard x - ray energy range , and to its position in the galactic centre crowed region , requiring good angular resolution .",
    "the ibis angular resolution , good sensitivity , large field of view and long exposure in the region of the galactic center are then appropriate to fulfil this task .",
    "in particular the ibis angular resolution ( @xmath29 ) allowed us to clearly resolve ks 1741 - 293 from other x - ray sources in the field of view , especially from the nearest source 1a 1742 - 294 .    using open time and core programme data , we have monitored , with a mcrab sensitivity in the 20 - 40 kev band , the hard x - ray emission for a time period of more then two years .",
    "we have obtained a clear ibis detection only during the visibility periods 52698 - 52792 mjd and 53052 - 53115 mjd , showing that hard x - ray emission from this source is not persistent .",
    "the measured orbital periods for lmxbs range from a fraction of hour to tens of hours ( see @xcite ) . during the @xmath30 visibility period",
    "the source shows a smooth flux variation by a factor of four , without evidence of periodicity in the light curve on a time scale of 60 days . during the first visibility period",
    "there is no evidence of source flux variation .",
    "we have obtained for the first time a wide band ( from 5 to 100 kev ) spectrum using the simultaneous jem - x and ibis data .",
    "the spectrum is fitted with a two component model . while the blackbody soft component could originate from the surface of an accretion disk , the neutron star surface , or both , the hard tail , fitted by a cut - off power law , or by a comptonized model @xcite ,",
    "is due to a comptonization of soft photons in a hot plasma around the neutron star .",
    "we have detected two type i x - ray burst with jem - x , at a position clearly consistent with the ibis ks 1741 - 293 detection .",
    "the temporal analysis with jem - x confirms the single peak bursts of ks 1741 - 293 , as firstly reported by @xcite .",
    "the spectral proprieties of the hard tailed lmxbs are discussed in @xcite .",
    "ks 1741 - 293 can be included in this class of sources .",
