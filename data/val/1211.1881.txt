    "since its invention , atomic force microscopy ( afm ) has become a routine technique for surface characterization at high spatial resolution . of the various modes of afm operation",
    ", dynamic - mode afm offers the advantage of reduced drift effect and reduced lateral drag forces on the sample , thus greatly contributing to the versatility of the technique@xcite . in dynamic - mode afm ,",
    "the cantilever is oscillated at its resonance frequency and the interaction with the sample is probed via changes in the cantilever oscillation .",
    "this is significantly more complicated in liquid , because of viscous damping . in aqueous solution , the natural environment for biological molecules ,",
    "cantilever quality factors are of order one .",
    "such low quality factors imply a less harmonic and thus harder to interpret cantilever response , yield reduced force sensitivity and , for stiffer cantilevers , an increased relative importance of the noise in the detection of the cantilever deflection .",
    "these problems have at least partly been overcome in specialized equipment , by the development of low - noise deflection detectors@xcite and operation at small oscillation amplitudes , resulting among others in atomic resolution on solid - liquid interfaces by frequency - modulation afm@xcite . in an alternative , `` diving - bell '' approach ,",
    "only a small portion of the afm tip was dipped in the liquid medium@xcite , leading to significantly higher quality factors than when the whole cantilever is submerged .",
    "the problems persist , however , in many standard afm systems .",
    "an even more general problem lies in the actuation of the cantilever resonance .",
    "a standard piezo - acoustic drive actuates the whole fluid cell or at best the cantilever support chip , and simultaneously excites a wide range of mechanical resonances , commonly known as the `` forest of peaks '' that is observed in liquid afm @xcite .",
    "such spurious mechanical resonances usually dominate the low-@xmath1 resonance of the cantilever itself , which makes it hard to tune to the cantilever resonance or specifically enhance its effective @xmath1 by external positive feedback@xcite and which affects any quantitative interpretation of phase contrast of measured frequency shifts @xcite .",
    "in addition , because of the macroscopic nature of these spurious resonances , they are prone to drift .",
    "these problems have motivated a wide variety of approaches to uniquely actuate the cantilever resonance , i.e. , without actuating any other , spurious resonances .",
    "the cantilever response should thus closely resemble that of a simple harmonic oscillator .",
    "while progress has been made by optimizing piezo - acoustic actuation @xcite , it has been suggested that the focus in the future should be on `` direct '' actuation methods@xcite .",
    "magnetic @xcite , photothermal@xcite and electrostatic actuation@xcite provide valuable alternatives that , unlike piezo - acoustic methods , only excite the cantilever itself .    in this work ,",
    "we have attempted to overcome the problems related to viscous damping by enhancing the ( intrinsic ) cantilever quality factor .",
    "to do so , we deliberately increased the inertial mass of the cantilever by attaching beads with tens of m diameter and g masses . while there are models to determine the shift in the resonance frequency after the attachment of beads at a specific position on the cantilever , these models are only valid for a bead mass much smaller than the cantilever mass@xcite .",
    "however , to achieve a significant increase in the quality factor , beads of masses greater than the cantilever mass are needed .",
    "we chose magnetic beads to facilitate the comparison between piezo - acoustic actuation and `` ideal '' magnetic actuation of the cantilevers .    in this paper , we first describe the experimental setup for magnetic actuation and bead attachment ( section  [ sec : expsetup ] ) .",
    "next ( section  [ sec : results ] ) , we demonstrate the effect of the beads on the thermal noise spectrum and resonant response of the cantilever to external actuation , and provide an analysis of the minimum force gradient that can be detected by cantilevers with beads of various sizes .",
    "we also include a demonstration of afm imaging in liquid using this method .",
    "we summarize our results in section  [ sec : comment ] , before giving further details on the magnetic actuation in appendix  [ sec : solenoid ] .",
    "we expect such details to be of wider applicability and use for implemention in any afm system that is mounted on an inverted optical microscope .",
    "all experiments and operations were carried out with a nanowizard i afm system ( jpk instruments , berlin , germany ) , mounted on an inverted light microscope ( ix71 , olympus , tokio , japan ) .",

    "the nominal dimensions ( length @xmath2 width @xmath2 thickness ) are @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the nch and fm cantilevers , respectively .",
    "cantilever deflections were measured with conventional beam deflection , and the detector was calibrated by pressing the cantilever into a hard substrate by ramping the ( calibrated ) @xmath5 scanner .",
    "beads were selected from an isotropic magnetic powder ( mqp - s-11 - 9 , magnequench , now part of : molycorp , greenwood village , colorado , usa ) .",
    "they were selected for their size as measured on the inverted optical microscope , using a calibrated grid on the output of the camera on the microscope .",
    "bead masses were estimated based on their diameter and the mass density of the bead material .    of the various methods to attach particles",
    "to cantilevers@xcite , we chose the combination of the afm head and inverted light microscope as a micromanipulator for the attachment process , and used a uv - curing glue ( glass bond , loctite ) as an adhesive . to optimize the process of bead attachment , a customized , perspex cantilever holder was used , see fig .",

    ", the beads on the cantilevers were magnetized along their axes by bringing them close to a small , strong ( grade : n42 ) permanent neodymium magnet ( f346 , magnet expert , sutton - on - trent , uk ) . the equivalent field at a distance of 2  mm is approximately 1.4 tesla . compared to other methods of preparing magnetized cantilevers@xcite ,",
    "magnetic beads have the advantage of enabling significant ( at least several nm ) oscillation amplitudes even for cantilevers with spring constants of @xmath11  n / m .    to generate a driving magnetic field ,",

    "this arrangement , with a solenoid under the sample , is similar to the one adopted elsewhere@xcite . unlike designs where the cantilever is placed inside an electromagnet on the fluid cell@xcite , this has the advantage of facilitating heat dissipation in the solenoid away from the cantilever and sample .",
    "this arrangement implies that afm imaging with magnetic actuation can not be performed simultaneously with optical imaging using the inverted microscope , but it is straightforward to switch to optical microscopy in between afm scans by moving an objective to the optical axis instead of the solenoid .",

    "higher @xmath1 values , as found here , are convenient for finding and tracking the cantilever resonance .",
    "the @xmath1 value is also an important factor , however , for determining the force sensitivity , or more strictly speaking , the minimum detectable force gradient @xmath31 in the proximity of the tip to the sample in an afm experiment . to estimate this quantity ,",
    "we adopt a commonly used approach@xcite : we focus on elastic interactions only and assume that the force gradient is constant over the whole cantilever oscillation .",
    "a force gradient @xmath32 will then cause a well - defined shift @xmath33 of the cantilever resonance frequency . under the assumption that this shift is small compared to the width of the resonance , as is appropriate in liquid , this implies a change in cantilever phase @xmath34 with respect to the phase of a free cantilever oscillation that is driven near the resonance frequency .",
    "since the phase noise of an oscillation is directly related to the amplitude noise @xmath35 via @xmath36 , the minimum detectable force gradient therefore follows from @xmath37 with @xmath38 the amplitude of the oscillation ( all amplitudes are rms values unless stated otherwise ) .",

    "<S> dynamic - mode atomic force microscopy ( afm ) in liquid remains complicated due to the strong viscous damping of the cantilever resonance . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that a high - quality resonance ( @xmath0 ) can be achieved in aqueous solution by attaching a microgram - bead at the end of the nanogram - cantilever . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting increase in cantilever mass causes the resonance frequency to drop significantly . </S>",
    "<S> however , the force sensitivity  as expressed via the minimum detectable force gradient  is hardly affected , because of the enhanced quality factor . via the enhancement of the quality factor </S>",
    "<S> , the attached bead also reduces the relative importance of noise in the deflection detector . </S>",
    "<S> it can thus yield an improved signal - to - noise ratio when this detector noise is significant . </S>",
    "<S> we describe and analyze these effects for a set - up which includes magnetic actuation of the cantilevers and which can be easily implemented in any afm system that is compatible with an inverted optical microscope . </S>"
