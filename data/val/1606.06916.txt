    "the neutrinos produced in the upper atmosphere due to the bombardment of cosmic rays are the best tools for the study of neutrino oscillations .",
    "there are many ongoing and proposed experiments worldwide to study the phenomena of neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "the neutrinos with energies between 1 to 3 gev form bulk of the signal in the detector .",
    "the neutrino in this energy range can interact with matter by many processes such as quasi elastic scattering , interaction via resonance pion production , and deep inelastic scattering @xcite .",
    "there is also coherent pion production process in neutrino nucleus scattering @xcite .",
    "the charge current interactions of neutrinos inside the matter are important since the experiments measure the recoil muon produced in such interactions .",
    "the materials like carbon and iron @xcite offer a convenient detector medium for such experiments .    at the lowest neutrino energies , the interactions with nucleon are either elastic or quasi elastic in which the nucleon recoils intact . in the neutral current ( nc ) elastic scattering ,",
    "all neutrinos and all anti - neutrinos can scatter off both neutrons and protons : @xmath4 . when neutrinos acquire sufficient energy , they can also undergo the charged current interactions : @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "this is called charged current quasi - elastic scattering ( ccqes ) as a charged lepton mass is created .",
    "ccqes interactions are important to neutrino physics for two reasons : first , the nucleon recoils intact that enables to measure weak nucleon form factors which are difficult to measure in other scattering probes .",
    "second , the two body interaction enables the kinematics to be completely reconstructed and hence the initial neutrino energy can be determined which is critical for measuring the oscillation parameters .",
    "thus , a reliable description of the neutrino quasi elastic scattering ( qes ) processes ( particularly on nuclear targets ) is essential for precision studies of neutrino oscillation parameters , such as mass splitting and mixing angles @xcite .",
    "the most popular model for the ccqes calculations is the llewellyn smith ( ls ) model @xcite . the fermi gas model @xcite with pauli suppression condition is used in the case of bound nucleon to include nuclear modifications .",
    "these models have advantage that they can be readily incorporated into existing neutrino monte carlo generators @xcite @xcite , though there exist more sophisticated calculations of quasi elastic scattering such as relativistic distorted - wave impulse approximation @xcite . at neutrino energies above 1 gev ,",
    "the total and differential qes cross sections on nuclear targets are calculated assuming that the scattering is with free nucleons . with this assumption a global analysis @xcite of the qes cross sections measured in high energy @xmath7 experiments on nuclear targets",
    "finds a value of @xmath8 gev .",
    "there are recent measurements of differential and total cross sections for qes of @xmath9 of energies above 4 gev on carbon by the nomad collaboration @xcite .",
    "the nomad analysis of cross sections assuming free nucleon model yields a value of @xmath10 = @xmath110.06  gev .",
    "nuclear effects as will be shown here reduce the cross section by 10 % even at higher neutrino energy above 1 gev which implies that a larger fit value of @xmath10 is expected if the nuclear effects are included .",
    "the qes cross sections for low energy ( @xmath12 ) 1 gev neutrino scattering on carbon measured by the miniboone detector @xcite is 20@xmath13 larger than the model calculations . the model calculations of miniboone analysis use a large value of axial mass ( 1.35 gev ) which increases the total cross section at all energies along with an empirical parameter in the pauli blocking condition which decreases the cross section at lower energies @xcite .",
    "the data from k2k with oxygen target @xcite also require a higher value @xmath10 = @xmath14 .    in this work ,",
