    "the study of light propagation in a scattering system has become a very active field of research in mesoscopic physics for few years because of its many applications in particular in biomedical imaging  @xcite .",
    "lots of key features like anderson localization of photons  @xcite or fluorescence lifetime of a single emitter embedded in a complex system have to be understood in such a system  @xcite . a very good medium to deal with these fundamental phenomena",
    "is composed of cold atoms .",
    "cold atoms can be manipulated with a high degree of control in particular to realize a monodisperse ensemble of strongly resonant point scatterers , free of defects and absorption .    since the thirties and the pioneering work of kenty  @xcite , the trapping of photons in a scattering and resonant system is well understood . for a dilute system illuminated by a laser beam and in the limit of low saturation of the atomic transition",
    "( e.g. at low light intensity for resonant light ) and sufficiently low density for atom - atom collisional broadening to be neglected , the scattering remains fully elastic .",
    "thus , during its propagation through the system , the light remains monochromatic and the scattering mean - free path can be continuously adjusted by tuning the laser frequency .",
    "it is then possible to observe coherent effect such as weak and strong localization  @xcite .    at very low temperature and",
    "if the system is not too large , the residual motion of the atoms does not modify significantly the frequency of a scattered photon and coherent effects such as coherent backscattering  @xcite can still be observed , as if the atoms were pinned at fixed positions .",
    "residual motion even provides us with a significant advantage : averaging over different disorder realizations is done automatically by just waiting for the atoms to move by say one wavelength , i.e. by trivial time averaging .",
    "the doppler shift of the scattered photon can be neglected if the frequency change does not modify the propagation properties , meaning that the scattered photon can be rescattered like the incoming ones .",
    "the scattering cross - section varies rapidly around an atomic resonance at frequency @xmath0 over a frequency range @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the inverse of the lifetime of the atomic excited state .",
    "thus , if @xmath3 denotes the wave factor of the incoming photons and @xmath4 the typical atomic velocity , the typicla doppler shift after a scatteting event is @xmath5 and the regime of `` quasi - pinned '' disorder is reached when : @xmath6 as will be seen in the following , this is only a very rough criterion and a more careful analysis is needed .",
    "( [ validity - naive ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath7 the latter quantity being the quality factor of the atomic resonance , a number typically of the order of @xmath8 this thus puts a severe limit on the atomic velocity , of the order of 1 m / s , and explains why observation of coherent effects requires cold atomic gases .",
    "however , even if the temperature is low , for a sufficiently large medium , many scattering events can be chained before a photon escapes .",
    "even if the doppler shift of a single scattering event is small , the global frequency shift accumulated along a multiple scattering path can be non negligible .",
    "this depends of course on the optical thickness @xmath9 : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the size of the medium and @xmath12 the scattering mean free path of the photon in the medium . at large @xmath9",
    ", a typical multiple scattering path can be viewed as a random walk of the photon in the medium with step @xmath13 thus the photon is multiply scattered about @xmath14 times before escaping . as the doppler shift depends on the relative orientation of the atomic velocity and the incoming and outgoing wave vectors of the photon , it is on average a random variable with zero average and about @xmath15 variance .",
    "if successive scattering events are statistically independent , the photon frequency performs itself a random walk with step about @xmath16 and the typical accumulated doppler shift after @xmath17 scattering events is of the order of @xmath18 as @xmath19 a rough criterion for neglecting this effect becomes : @xmath20    some theoretical works has been done previously in particular in rather dense atomic vapors typical of interstellar atmospheres , when collisional broadening is larger than the natural linewidth of the atomic resonance .",
    "in such a regime , the scattering process is incoherent and inelastic : the frequency of the scattered photon is essentially decorrelated from the incoming frequency .",
    "this is the complete frequency redistribution ( cfr ) regime  @xcite .",
    "depending on parameters such as the optical thickness and the doppler broadening , several regimes can be obtained , leading to various decay rate equations such as the holstein s equation  @xcite . in that case , the photon frequency can be doppler shifted very far from resonance , so that the medium becomes almost transparent : this is a regime where photons trajectories can be lvy flights  @xcite .    the present work deals with the case of low temperature ( or slow atoms ) for which we can not assume a complete frequency redistribution .",
    "the partial frequency redistribution ( pfr ) is then due to doppler effect .",
    "this is an interesting new regime where the radiation transport has both coherent ( the individual scattering event ) and incoherent ( because of randomization due to the atomic motion ) aspects .",
    "moreover , the study of such a system is of primary importance to design new high capacity quantum memories using cold atoms , in particular to give a reliable expression of the escape factor ( i.e. exponential time decay rate at long times ) .",
    "the main idea is to derive a transport equation for the incoherent radiation from first principles in the case of moving atoms , taking into account the resonant character of the scatterers .",
    "this is very different from e.g. diffusing - wave spectroscopy theory  @xcite or electron transport  @xcite .",
    "it is also expected that the dynamics of the atoms affect the coherent properties of the system as shown experimentally  @xcite .",
    "theoritical and numerical works are in progress in particular to describe the thermal decoherence of the backscattering cone .",
    "more precisely , we deal with systems composed of a cloud of two - level atoms : this is a very good approximation for quasi - resonant atomic scatterers as e.g. rubidium atoms used in experiments .",
    "as we consider here only the incoherent transport of radiation , the existence of an internal hyperfine structure which leads to considerable modifications of the coherent transport such as coherent back scattering  @xcite , is irrelevant .",
    "we assume a dilute gas where the scattering mean free path is much larger than the optical wavelength .",
    "we will also treat atoms as classical point scatterers .",
    "this assumption certainly fails at very low temperature where the atomic de broglie wavelength becomes comparable to the optical wavelength : in this regime , the recoil effect induced by the scattering of a single photon significantly affects the motion of the center of mass of the atom .",
    "we thus exclude ultra - cold atomic gases . properly taking into account the quantum nature of the external atomic motion",
    "is a much more complicated problem , see e.g.  @xcite for the simple case of two atoms . for usual atoms like rubidium ,",
    "the recoil velocity is of the order of few mm / s , and one can easily have cold atoms faster than the recoil velocity , but still obeying eq .",
    "( [ validity - naive ] ) .",
    "we also exclude collective quantum effects such as bose - einstein condensation , taking place when the atomic de broglie wavelength is comparable to the inter - atomic distance .",
    "we are interested in typically an atomic cloud in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) , scattering photons from a laser beam .",
    "we will thus assume a thermal distribution of the atomic velocities .",
    "in such a system , the radiation felt deep in the medium is quasi - isotropic such that atoms are not significantly pushed by incoming photons .",
    "on the other handm , in a real experiment , if the laser beam is sufficiently intense , the accumulated recoil effect may significantly disturb the atomic velocity distribution . for simplicity , we neglect this effect , although taking it into account would be easy in the present framework .    the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ first_principles ] , we start from first principles to obtain a generalized form of the well - known dyson ( for the average field ) and bethe - salpeter ( for the field correlations , including the average intensity ) equations .",
    "then , some assumptions are done in sect .",
    "[ assumptions ] to derive the transport equation which is the main result of this paper . this equation is solved numerically in sect .",
    "[ numerical_sim ] using an original monte carlo scheme .",
    "finally , sect .",
    "[ modal_approach ] is devoted to the modal study of the transport equation to explicitly derive the spectral and temporal behaviors at large scales . in particular ,",
    "we show that , although the spatial motion of the photons is in general not diffusive , it is possible to derive equations of the fokker - planck type , which govern the evolution of the intensity distribution as a function of position and frequency .",
    "this section ends up with the simple picture story of photons migration valid at large scales .",
    "starting with first principles means that we have to derive a generalized form of the scattering operator taking into account the doppler effect",
    ". it will be the fundamental quantity of our derivation .",
    "as mentioned above , the recoil is not taken into account in this derivation because the recoil - induced drift of the frequency distribution is usually much smaller than the doppler - induced spreading ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "note that going beyond this approximation is far from trivial .",
    "we denote by @xmath22 the scattering operator for a single fixed atom . @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the incident and scattered wave - vectors respectively and @xmath25 is the frequency .",
    "the reader will find in appendix  [ fourier_transforms ] the conventions used for the spatio - temporal fourier transforms of all quantities .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we assume that all the scattering atoms are identical .",
    "let us consider an atom moving at velocity @xmath26 constant during the whole scattering process .",
    "we denote by @xmath27 the scattering operator for this moving atom ( subscript @xmath28 means _ moving _ ) .",
    "thus , the incident ( @xmath29 ) and scattered ( @xmath30 ) fields are related by @xmath31 in the scalar approximation ( polarization effects neglected ) , where @xmath32 is the green function in the vacuum .",
    "note that taking into account polarization effects is a straightforward extension of the present analysis .",
    "indeed , doppler effect acts similarly on all polarization components .",
    "it is thus sufficient to add the angular dependence of the scattering cross - section in all formulas .",
    "we drop this dependence for simplicity and focus on the main features related to the motion of the scatterers .",
    "considering now this expression in the atom frame , we have @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the field in the atom frame in which the atom is fixed .",
    "the relation between the incident and the scattered fields can be written in the form @xmath35 by identifying equations  ( [ scattering ] ) and  ( [ scattering2 ] ) and taking into account that the velocity of the atom is weak enough to have @xmath36 in the green operator , we have @xmath37,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the expression of the generalized scattering operator , a fundamental quantity in our derivation .",
    "@xmath38 denotes the dirac - delta function .",
    "the physical interpretation of @xmath39 is straightforward : the modification of frequency in the @xmath40 operator corresponds to the doppler shifted frequency in the atomic frame , while the @xmath38 function expresses that the scattering is elastic in the atomic frame .",
    "the latter expresses a strong correlation between the incoming and the outgoing frequency , in strong contrast with the usual complete frequency redistribution hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "the scalar scattering operator for pinned point scatterers is related to the polarizability by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the light velocity in vacuum .",
    "the system is composed of two - level atoms with resonant frequency @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath2 is the spontaneous emission decay rate .",
    "the incoming photons are quasi - resonant , such that @xmath43 . the two - level atom scalar polarizability",
    "is then given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the wave - vector in vacuum at frequency @xmath0 .",
    "we thus have @xmath46 thus , the generalized scattering operator is obtained by plugging eq .",
    "( [ tvm ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ scattering3 ] ) .",
    "the main differences between this equation and the expression of the scattering operator for fixed atoms are the dirac @xmath47 function representing the doppler frequency shift .",
    "the dyson equation is a closed equation for the field @xmath48 averaged over an ensemble of realization of the scattering medium  @xcite . for the case of fixed atoms ,",
    "the average is performed over the positions of the scatterers . for moving atoms ,",
    "the average is performed over the initial positions , times and velocities of the scatterers . in this case , the generalized form of the dyson equation is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is called the mass operator .",
    "it essentially describes the extinction phenomenon due to scattering .",
    "in particular , it contains the expression of the scattering mean - free path depicting the exponential decay of the averaged ( or coherent ) field .",
    "the mass operator is the equivalent of the self - energy for the schrdinger equation for matter waves in a random potential  @xcite . for fixed scatterers ,",
    "one usually considers a statistically translationally invariant infinite medium . in our case",
    ", we also assume that the atom velocity distribution is time - independent and uncorrelated with the position , so that @xmath51 this expression allows us to rewrite the dyson equation in term of a fourier transform : @xmath52 writing the same equation for the averaged green function , we obtain @xmath53 which gives the expression @xmath54 considering that @xmath55",
    ". then we can define a wave - vector in the effective homogeneous medium @xmath56 , the real and imaginary part of which give the effective wavelength and the scattering mean - free path respectively . to derive the expression of the mass operator",
    "we assume that the system is dilute enough for the first order diagrammatic expansion of the operator to be valid .",
    "this is the foldy - twersky approximation ( or the born approximation )  @xcite . in that case",
    ", the mass operator is the sum over all the @xmath17 scatterers of the averaged scattering operator for all accessible positions , times and velocities : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the probability density to have a scatterer of velocity @xmath26 at position @xmath59 and at time @xmath40 . for our translationally",

    "this leads to the final expression of the mass operator if we remark that @xmath66 : @xmath67 for a thermal distribution , this gives a standard voigt profile for absorption  @xcite , which itself reduces to a usual doppler gaussian profile in the limit @xmath68 in the latter case , the averaging over the atomic velocity makes the correlation between the incoming and scattered frequencies much smaller than for slow atoms .",
    "the bethe - salpeter equation is a closed equation for the field autocorrelation function @xmath69  @xcite .",
    "it contains an operator @xmath70 depending on four space variables called the intensity ( or vertex ) operator and describing the correlation between two scattering processes . as for the dyson equation ,",
    "the idea is to generalize this equation to the case of moving scatterers .",
    "this leads to a new vertex operator @xmath71 depending on four space variables and four time variables .",
    "we assume that no source is present ( the incident current densities associated with the coherent term are missing ) .",
    "thus the generalized bethe - salpeter equation writes :    @xmath72    where the symbol @xmath73 denotes the conjugate quantity .",
    "the global translational invariance in space and time for the averaged quantities leads to a factorization of the vertex operator as follows @xmath74 this leads to the following expression of the fourier transform of the bethe - salpeter equation for an infinite medium : @xmath75 where the function @xmath76 is the fourier form of the spatio - temporal correlation function of the electric field ( i.e. @xmath77 ) .",
    "as for the mass operator , we only keep the first term of the diagrammatic expansion of the vertex operator ( ladder approximation valid for a dilute gas ) which leads to a sum over all scatterers , and an averaging over all accessible positions , times and velocities of the scattering operator correlation function . in fourier space ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath78 the averaging over the atomic velocity is performed over the product @xmath79 to take into account the fact that the scattering process occurs on the same atom for the field and its conjugate .",

    "this simple picture can be used to find a quantitative criterion to discriminate between the doppler and the quadratic regimes too .",
    "as explained in the introduction , at large @xmath9 , a typical multiple scattering path can be viewed as a random walk of the photon in the medium with step @xmath12 approximately .",

    "the physical picture is quite clear : far detuned photons are relatively rare in the medium , because they are less trapped and escape more rapidly : this is why they manifest themselves in the transmitted and reflected fluxes more strongly than in the energy density in the bulk .",
