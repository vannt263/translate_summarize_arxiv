    "it is known that divergence operators fulfill maximal parabolic regularity on @xmath1 spaces  even if the underlying domain is non - smooth , the coefficients are discontinuous and the boundary conditions are mixed , see @xcite and also @xcite .",
    "this provides a powerful tool for the treatment of linear and nonlinear parabolic equations in @xmath1 spaces , see @xcite .",
    "the only disadvantage of this concept is that the appearing neumann conditions have to be homogeneous and that distributional right hand sides ( e.g. surface densities ) are not admissible . confronted with these phenomena , it seems an adequate alternative to consider the equations in distribution spaces , what we will do in this paper .",
    "pursuing this idea , one has , of course , to prove that the occurring elliptic operators satisfy parabolic regularity on those spaces in an appropriate sense .",
    "in fact , we show that , under very mild conditions on the domain @xmath2 , the dirichlet boundary part @xmath3 and the coeffcient function , elliptic divergence operators with real @xmath4-coefficients satisfy maximal parabolic regularity on a huge variety of spaces , among which are sobolev , besov and lizorkin - triebel spaces , provided that the differentiability index is between @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( cf .",
    "theorem  [ t - randterm ] ) .",
    "we consider this as the first main result of this work , also interesting in itself . up to now , the only existing results for mixed boundary conditions in distribution spaces ( apart from the hilbert space situation ) are , to our knowledge , that of grger @xcite and the recent one of griepentrog @xcite .",
    "concerning the dirichlet case , compare @xcite and references therein .",
    "having this first result at hand , the second aim of this work is the treatment of quasilinear parabolic equations of the formal type @xmath7 combined with mixed , nonlinear boundary conditions : @xmath8 let us point out some ideas , which will give a certain guideline for the paper : our analysis is based on a regularity result for the square root @xmath9 on @xmath1 spaces .",
    "it has already been remarked in the introduction of @xcite that estimates between @xmath10 and @xmath11 should provide powerful tools for the treatment of elliptic and parabolic problems involving divergence form operators .",
    "it seems , however , that this idea has not yet been developed to its full strength , cf .",
    "* ch .  5 ) .    originally , our strategy for proving maximal parabolic regularity for divergence operators on @xmath12 was to show an analog of the central result of @xcite , this time in case of mixed boundary conditions , namely that @xmath13 provides a topological isomorphism for suitable @xmath14",
    ". this would give the possibility of carrying over the maximal parabolic regularity , known for @xmath15 , to the dual of @xmath16 , because , roughly spoken , @xmath17 commutes with the corresponding parabolic solution operator .",
    "unfortunately , we were only able to prove the continuity of within the range @xmath18 , due to a result of duong and @xmath19intosh @xcite , but did not succeed in proving the continuity of the inverse in general .",
    "let us explicitely mention that the proof of the isomorphism property of would be a great achievement .",
    "in particular , this would allow here to avoid the localization procedure we had to introduce in section  [ sec - consequences ] in order to prove maximal parabolic regularity , and to generalize our results to higher dimensions .",
    "the isomorphism property is known for the hilbert space case @xmath20 ( see @xcite ) in case of mixed boundary conditions and even complex coefficients , but the proof fundamentally rests on the hilbert space structure , so that we do not see a possibility of directly generalizing this to the @xmath1 case .",
    "it turns out , however , that provides a topological isomorphism , if @xmath21 is the image under a volume - preserving and bi - lipschitz mapping of one of grger s model sets @xcite , describing the geometric configuration in neighborhoods of boundary points of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , in these cases one may carry over the maximal parabolic regularity from @xmath15 to @xmath22 knowing this , we localize the linear parabolic problem , use the local maximal parabolic information and interpret this again in the global context at the end .",
    "interpolation with the @xmath1 result then yields maximal parabolic regularity on the corresponding interpolation spaces .    let us explicitely mention that the concept of grger s regular sets , where the domain itself is a lipschitz domain , seems adequate to us , because it covers many realistic geometries that fail to be domains with lipschitz boundary .",
    "the price one has to pay is that the problem of optimal elliptic regularity becomes much more delicate and , additionally , trace theorems for this situation are scarcely to be found in the literature .    the strategy for proving that , admit a unique local solution is as follows .",
    "we reformulate into a usual quasilinear equation , where the time derivative directly affects the unknown function .",
    "assuming additionally that the elliptic operator @xmath23 provides a topological isomorphism for a @xmath24 larger than the space dimension @xmath25 , the existence and uniqueness results for abstract quasilinear equations of prss ( see @xcite , see also @xcite ) apply to the resulting quasilinear parabolic equation .",
    "the detailed discussion how to assure all requirements of @xcite , including the adequate choice of the banach space , is presented in section  6 .",
    "the crucial point is that the linear elliptic operator which corresponds to the initial value satisfies maximal parabolic regularity , which has been proved before .",
    "let us further emphasize that the presented setting allows for coefficient functions that really jump at hetero interfaces of the material and permits mixed boundary conditions , as well as domains which do not possess a lipschitz boundary , see section  [ sec - examples ] .",
    "it is well known that this is required when modelling real world problems , see e.g. @xcite for problems from thermodynamics or @xcite concerning biological models .",
    "last but not least , heterostructures are the determining features of many fundamental effects in semiconductors , see for instance @xcite .",
    "one further advantage is that nonlinear , nonlocal boundary conditions are admissible in our concept , despite the fact that the data is highly non - smooth , compare @xcite .",
    "the calculus of maximal parabolic @xmath26 t_0 , t \\right[;x)$ ] regularity is preferable to the concept of hlder continuity in time , because it allows for reaction terms @xmath27 which discontinously depend on time .",
    "this is important in many examples ( see ) , in particular in the control theory of parabolic equations .",
    "alternatively , the reader should think e.g. of a manufacturing process for semiconductors , where light is switched on / off at a sharp time point and , of course , parameters in the chemical process then change abruptly .",
    "it is remarkable that , nevertheless , the solution is hlder continuous simultaneously in space and time , see corollary  [ c - hoel ] below .",
    "we finish these considerations by looking at the special case of semilinear problems .",
    "it turns out that here satisfactory results may be achieved even without the additional continuity condition on @xmath28 mentioned above , see corollary  [ t - semil ] .    in section  [ sec - examples ]",
    "we give examples for geometries , dirichlet boundary parts and coefficients in three dimensions for which our additional supposition , the isomorphy @xmath29 really holds for a @xmath30 . in subsection  [ subsec - balks ]",
    "we take a closer look at the special geometry of two crossing beams , which provides a geometrically easy example of a domain @xmath2 that does not have a lipschitz boundary and thus can not be treated by former theories , but which is covered by our results .    finally , some concluding remarks are given in section  [ sec - remarks ] .",
    "throughout this article the following assumptions are valid .    * @xmath31 is a bounded lipschitz domain and @xmath32 is an open subset of @xmath33 . *",

    "of course , if @xmath41 , then @xmath42 and if @xmath43 , then @xmath44 .",

    "the resulting object , intersected with a sufficiently small paraxial cube @xmath1057 , equals the convex set @xmath1073 here again remark  [ r - groegerreg ] applies , what finishes the proof .",
    "[ r - conc8 ] the reader may have asked himself why we restricted the considerations to real , symmetric coefficient functions @xmath34 .",
    "the answer is twofold : first , we need at all costs gaussian estimates for our techniques and it is known that these are not available for complex coefficients in general , see @xcite and also @xcite . additionally , proposition [ p - ausch / tcha ] also rests on this supposition . on the other hand , in the applications we have primarly in mind",
    "this condition is satisfied .      besides",
    ", the question arises whether the limitation for the exponents , caused by the localization procedure , is principal in nature or may be overcome when applying alternative ideas and techniques ( cf .",
    "theorem [ t - mainsectdown ] ) .",
    "we do not know the answer at present .",
    "[ r - conc1 ] we considered here only the case of one single parabolic equation , but everything can be carried over in a straightforward way to the case of diagonal systems ; diagonal in this case means that the function @xmath934 is allowed to depend on the vector @xmath1074 of solutions and the right hand side also . in the same spirit",
    "one can treat triagonal systems .",
    "[ r - conc2 ] inspecting proposition  [ p - pruess ] , one easily observes that in fact an additional @xmath403-dependence of the function @xmath934 would be admissible .",
    "we did not carry this out here for the sake of technical simplicity .",
    "[ r - conc3 ] in we restricted our setting to the case where the dirichlet boundary condition is homogeneous .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize this to the case of inhomogeneous dirichlet conditions by splitting off the inhomogeneity , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "ii.2 ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "1.2 ) , see also @xcite where this has been carried out in detail in the case of parabolic systems .",
    "[ r - conc4 ] if one knows a priori that the right hand side of depends hlder continuously on the time variable @xmath403 , then one can use other local existence and uniqueness results for abstract parabolic equations , see e.g. @xcite for details . in this case",
    "the solution @xmath814 is even strongly differentiable in the space @xmath70 ( with continuous derivative ) , what may lead to a better justification of time discretization then , compare @xcite and references therein .",
    "[ r - conc5 ] let us explicitely mention that assumption  [ a - q ] is not always fulfilled in the 3-@xmath25 case .",
    "first , there is the classical counterexample of meyers , see @xcite , a simpler ( and somewhat more striking ) one is constructed in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the point , however , is that not the mixed boundary conditions are the obstruction but a somewhat irregular behavior of the coefficient function @xmath34 in the inner of the domain .",
    "if one is confronted with this , spaces with weight may be the way out .",
    "[ r - conc7 ] in two and three space dimensions one can give the following simplifying characterization for a set @xmath21 to be regular in the sense of grger , i.e. to satisfy assumption  [ a - groegerregulaer ]  a ) , see @xcite :    if @xmath1075 is a bounded lipschitz domain and @xmath1076 is relatively open , then @xmath1077 is regular in the sense of grger iff @xmath1078 is the finite union of ( non - degenerate ) closed arc pieces .",
