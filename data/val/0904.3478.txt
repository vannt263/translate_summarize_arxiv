    "the study of curves via words was introduced by c. f. gauss @xcite .",
    "gauss encoded closed planar curves by words of certain type which are now called gauss words .",
    "we can apply this method to encode multi - component curves on surfaces .",
    "for instance , in @xcite and @xcite v. turaev studied stable equivalence classes of curves on surfaces by using generalized gauss words ( called nanowords ) .",
    "more precisely a nanoword over an alphabet @xmath0 endowed with an involution @xmath1 is a word in an alphabet @xmath2 endowed with a projection latexmath:[$\\mathcal{a } \\ni a \\mapsto    the case where the alphabet @xmath0 consists of two elements permuted by @xmath4 , the notion of a nanoword over @xmath0 is equivalent to the notion of an open virtual string introduced in @xcite .",
    "turaev introduced the homotopy equivalence on the set of nanowords over @xmath0 .",
    "the homotopy equivalence relation is generated by three types of moves on nanowords .",
    "the first move consists of deleting two consecutive entries of the same letter .",
    "the second move has the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 are words and @xmath7 are letters such that @xmath8 .",
    "the third move has the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 are words and @xmath11 are letters such that @xmath12 .",
    "these moves are suggested by the three local deformations of curves on surfaces ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and @xcite for more details ) . in @xcite turaev showed that a stable equivalence class of an oriented pointed curve on a surface is identified with a homotopy class of nanoword in a 2-letter alphabet .",
    "moreover turaev extended this result to multi - component curves .",
    "in fact a stable equivalence class of an oriented , ordered , pointed multi - component curve on a surface is identified with a homotopy class of a nanophrase in a 2-letter alphabet .",
    "roughly speaking , a nanophrase is a sequence of words where concatenation of those words is a nanoword ( see also sub - section [ nphhom ] and section [ nvm ] for more details ) . thus , using turaev s theory of words and phrases , we can treat curves on surfaces algebraically",
    ".    homotopy classification of nanowords was given by turaev in @xcite .",
    "turaev gave the classification of nanowords less than or equal to @xmath13 letters .",
    "moreover , the author introduced new invariants of nanophrases and gave the homotopy classification of nanophrases of length @xmath14 with less than or equal to @xmath15 letters in @xcite , using turaev s classification of nanowords .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give the classification theorem of nanophrases over arbitrary alphabet with less than or equal @xmath15 letters without the condition on length . as a corollary of this theorem",
    ", we classify the multi - component curves with minimum crossing number less than or equal to @xmath14 which has no `` untide '' components up to stable equivalence ( theorem [ mthm ] ) .",
    "the constitution of this paper is as follows . in sections 2 - 4",
    "we review the theory of multi - component curves and the homotopy theory of words and phrases . in section 5",
    "we introduce known results on the classification of nanowords and nanophrases up to homotopy and we generalize these results to phrases of an arbitrary length .",
    "finally in section 6 we give the proof of the main theorem in this paper .",
    "in this paper a _ curve _ means the image of a generic immersion of an oriented circle into an oriented surface .",
    "the word `` generic '' means that the curve has only a finite set of self - intersections which are all double and transversal .",
    "a _ @xmath16-component curve _ is defined in the same way as a curve with the difference that they may be formed by @xmath16 curves rather than only one curve .",
    "these curves are _ components _ of the @xmath16-component curve .",
    "a @xmath16-component curves are _ pointed _ if each component is endowed with a base point ( the origin ) distinct from the crossing points of the @xmath16-component curve .",
    "a @xmath16-component curve is _ ordered _ if its components are numerated.two ordered , pointed curves are _ stably homeomorphic _ if there is an orientation preserving homeomorphism of their regular neighborhoods in the ambient surfaces mapping the first multi - component curve onto the second one and preserving the order , the origins , and the orientations of the components .",
    "now we define stable equivalence of ordered , pointed multi - component curves @xcite : two ordered , pointed multi - component curves are _ stably equivalent _ if they can be related by a finite sequence of the following transformations : ( i ) a move replacing a ordered , pointed multi - component curve with a stably homeomorphic one ; ( ii ) a deformation of a pointed curve in its ambient surface away from the origin ( such a deformation may push a branch of the multi - component curves across another branch or a double point but not across the origin of the curves ) as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "we denote the set of stable equivalence classes of ordered , pointed @xmath16-component curves by @xmath17 .",
    "the theory of stable equivalence class of multi - component curves on surfaces is closely related to the theory of virtual strings .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for more details .",
    "we will show a following theorem by using turaev s theory of words .",
    "an ordered , pointed multi - component surface - curve is called _ irreducible _ if it is not stably equivalent to a surface - curve with a simply closed component .",

    "[ rem1 ] we want to list up the stable equivalence classes of irreducible ordered , pointed multi - component surface - curves with minimal crossing number less than or equal to @xmath14 .",
    "however there are too many curves to list up .",
    "so in fig .",
    "[ listfig ] we make just the list of multi - component curves without order and orientation of the components .",
    "if we choose order and orientation , then we obtain a ordered , pointed multi - component curve .",
    "two different pictures from fig . [ listfig ]",
    "never produce equivalent ordered , pointed multi - component surface - curves . on the other hand it is possible that two different additional structures ( orientation and the order ) on the same picture yield equivalent ordered , pointed multi - component surface - curves . more precisely , 2 ( respectively 2 , 8 , 4 , 24 , 12 ) different ordered , pointed multi - component surface - curves arise from the upper left ( respectively upper middle , upper right , lower left , lower middle , lower right ) picture . by the theorem [ ctk4 ] ,",
