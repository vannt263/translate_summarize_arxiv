    "the nutation dynamics of magnetic moments has been investigated using various theoretical approaches though not yet evidenced experimentally .",
    "bttcher and henk studied the significance of nutation in magnetization dynamics of nanostructures such as a chain of fe atoms , and co islands on cu(111 ) @xcite .",
    "they found that the nutation is significant on the femtosecond time scale with a typical damping constant of 0.01 up to 0.1 .",

    "the numerical simulations of the illg and llg models lead to different behaviors for the shape of the precession resonance peak . in the llg model",
    "the fwhm and the bandwidth exhibit a linear evolution with the applied static field which results in a constant evolution when divided by the resonance angular frequency .",
    "very different behaviors are observed within the illg model where no linear evolution of the fwhm or the bandwidth is measured .",
    "[ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] show that high applied static fields in large damping materials produce large differences between the positions and shapes of the precession resonance peaks originating from the llg and illg models .",
    "therefore , applying high static fields in large damping materials better allows to differentiate the precession peak originating from the illg and llg models . +",
    "although the theory is clear and allows in principle to differentiate inertial from non - inertial dynamics when examining both precession resonance peaks , the experimental investigations are rather more complex .",
    "indeed , the experimental demonstration of inertial effects first necessitate to identify and control the different contributions to the effective field ( anisotropy , dipolar interaction , magnetostriction , ... ) other than the applied static field .",
    "the magnetization dynamics in the illg model that takes into account inertial effects has been studied from both analytical and numerical points of view . within the fmr context",
    ", a nutation resonance peak is expected in addition to the usual precession resonance peak .",
    "+ analytical solutions of the inertial precession and nutation angular frequencies are presented .",
    "the analytical solutions nicely agree with the numerical simulations of the resonance curves in a broad range of parameters . at first , we investigated the effects of the time scale @xmath0 which drives the additional inertial term introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) compared to the usual llg equation eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "we also varied the dimensionless damping @xmath1 and the static magnetic field @xmath2 , and a scaling function with respect to @xmath3 is found for the nutation angular frequency .",
    "remarquably , the same scaling holds for the precession angular frequency when @xmath4 .",
    "+ in the second part of the paper we focussed on the signatures of the inertial dynamics which could be detected experimentally within the fmr context .",
    "we showed that beyond the measure of the nutation resonance peak which would be a direct signature of the inertial dynamics , the precession is modified by inertia and the illg precession resonance peak is different from the usual llg precession peak . indeed , whereas a linear evolution with respect to @xmath2 is expected for the llg precession resonance angular frequency , the illg precession resonance angular frequency is clearly non - linear .",
    "furthermore , the shape of the precession resonance peak is different in the llg and illg models .",
    "again , the width variation of the precession resonance peak is non - linear in the illg dynamics as opposed to the linear evolution with @xmath2 in the llg dynamics .",
    "we also showed that the difference between both llg and illg precession peaks is more pronounced when the damping is increased and when @xmath0 is increased .",
    "for example the discrepancy between the llg and illg precession resonance angular frequencies at @xmath171 for @xmath172 is expected to be of the order of @xmath173 for @xmath83 and @xmath174 for @xmath130 .",
    "therefore , large damping materials are better candidates to experimentally evidence the inertial dynamics of the magnetization . + finally , a specific behavior of the amplitude of the magnetic susceptibility as a function of the nutation resonance angular frequency @xmath175 is predicted , of the form @xmath176 ( analogous to that of the usual fmr susceptibility ) . this law could be a useful criterion in order to discriminate the nutation peak among the other excitations that could also occur close to the infrared region ( 100 ghz up to 100 thz ) in a ferromagnetic material .",
