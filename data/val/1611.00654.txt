    "fine tuning \" problem with @xmath0 @xcite , observations grossly favour the @xmath0cdm model ( with @xmath0 and the cold dark matter ( cdm ) as the dominant energy contributors @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the type ia supernovae data @xcite , as well as the wmap @xcite and planck results @xcite , do provide some room for a de with at least a slowly time - varying equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath1 , on an average close to the @xmath0cdm value ( equal to @xmath2 ) .",
    "extensive studies of the dynamical aspects of de have covered a wide range of models @xcite commonly involving one or more scalar field(s ) , e.g. quintessence , k - essence , dilaton , tachyon , chameleon , etc .",
    "@xcite , or aerodynamic fluids , such as the chaplygin gas and its variants @xcite .",
    "some of these have their origin traced from underlying string / m theories @xcite or brane - world scenarios involving dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) actions @xcite . besides , there are de models in modified / alternative theories of gravity @xcite ( e.g. the @xmath3 theories . ]",
    "@xcite ) , which have drawn considerable attention in recent years .",
    "in many occasions , such purely geometric theories have one - to - one mapping with scalar - tensor theories , and as such give rise to interacting dark energy - matter scenarios @xcite under conformal transformations .",
    "a class of theories that comes under the alternative gravity category , is that of scalar field(s ) coupled to gravity with torsion , viz .",
    "the _ metric - scalar - torsion _ ( mst ) theories @xcite .",
    "our objective here is to look for cosmological models that emerge out of these theories , particularly from the de perspective .",
    "torsion , which geometrically manifests the classical spin density , is a third rank ( partially ) antisymmetric tensor field introduced via the covariant derivative in theoretical formulations of gravity in the riemann - cartan space - time @xcite .",
    "such theories , unlike general relativity ( gr ) , are characterized by an asymmetric ( but metric - compatible ) affine connection , a two - index antisymmetrization of which is identified as the torsion .",
    "the study of torsion has a very long history that traces back to the attempts of cartan and einstein , in early 1920s , to unify the fundamental interactions in the spirit of general covariance @xcite .",
    "modern conception of torsion is often apprehended as a classical background being provided for quantized matter with spin , and as such torsion could be a low energy manifestation of a fundamental ( quantum gravitational ) theory @xcite .",
    "for instance , the massless antisymmetric kalb - ramond ( kr ) field in closed string theory is argued to be the source of a completely antisymmetric torsion in the low energy limit @xcite .",
    "many implications of such a kr - induced torsion have been studied in detail , both in the four dimensional framework as well as in the extra dimensional scenarios @xcite .",
    "cosmology in particular being a major area of testing torsion , a few pertinent works worth special mention , viz .",
    "the torsion quintessence models @xcite , the @xmath4 models in _ teleparallel _ theories @xcite , and the models based on the extended gravity theories @xcite and the poincar gauge theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "we in this paper study the role of torsion , and its coupling with curvature and scalar field ( i.e. the mst coupling ) , in explaining the dynamical evolution of de in a self - consistent way .",
    "in particular , restricting ourselves to homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies , we examine the conditions under which the mst theory can give rise to a cosmological model with a presumably slow de dynamics , not differing much from @xmath0cdm .",
    "conversely , from a supposition that such a mst - de model exists , we look to determine the bounds on the torsion mode parameters , and hence constrain the mst theory . our formalism is based on the assumption of a specific non - minimal coupling of the scalar field with the four - dimensional riemann - cartan ( or @xmath5 ) lagrangian .",
    "this may be justified from the point of view that the ( usual ) minimal mst coupling encounters a uniqueness problem when it comes to defining equivalent actions upon integrating out the boundary terms in four dimensions @xcite . by virtue of the non - minimal mst action",
    ", the ( vector ) trace mode of torsion gets sourced by the ( supposedly primordial ) scalar field , and hence gets eliminated via a constraint relation .",
    "moreover , the assumption of a homogeneous and isotropic universe , described by the well - known friedmann - roberstson - walker ( frw ) metric , puts certain restrictions on the torsion degrees of freedom .",
    "specifically , since the four - dimensional frw space - time is foliated into three - dimensional maximally symmetric hypersurfaces of constant time , the torsion tensor components which uphold the maximal symmetry can only exist , and that too with a constrained coordinate dependence @xcite .",
    "suitable implementation of such constraints ( or a few alternative ones ) in the action may result in the scalar field picking up an effective mass , in addition to its inherent mass ( if any ) , at the expense of one of the torsion modes , viz .",
    "the completely antisymmetric or the pseudo - trace mode .",
    "one is thus left with a scalar - tensor theory equivalent action that exhibits a non - minimal coupling of a massive scalar field with the riemannian curvature scalar ( @xmath6 ) in four dimensions .",
    "we obtain specific cosmological solutions of the field equations derived from such an action , in course of building up a viable dynamic de model .",
    "however such dynamics , is assumed be fairly weak at the cosmological scales , so that the cosmological parameters for the model are kept within the limits given by the @xmath0cdm error estimates from recent observations .",
    "while dealing with the effective scalar - tensor theory , we take into account the formalisms in both the _ einstein _ frame and the _ jordan _ frame ( in which the corresponding mst action could be reduced to the brans - dicke ( bd ) form ) . whereas the jordan frame exhibits an explicit non - minimal coupling of the scalar field with curvature , in the einstein frame the scalar has an inherent coupling with the cosmological matter ( which we consider to be the non - relativistic _ dust _ ) .",
    "although these two frames are mathematically equivalent , being related by a conformal transformation , their physical equivalence is reinstated only by a redefinition of the units of mass , length and time under the transformation .",
    "this makes the coupling constants in one frame , evolving with time in the other .",
    "as the formulation of a physical theory in a frame with running coupling constants is generally not feasible , in the literature one often finds a rigid set of units chosen for either of the frames , which of course destroys their physical equivalence @xcite .",
    "so it becomes difficult to decide which frame is suitable for interpreting observational results . without getting into this much debated issue ( which has no clear resolution till date )",
    ", we use the observational results to constrain our model in both einstein and jordan frames , taking one or the other to be physical .",
    "the assumption of weak de dynamics allows us to make the parametric estimation of our model in comparison with @xmath0cdm .",
    "we take into account the @xmath0cdm parametric marginalizations due to the wmap 9 year data @xcite and the planck 2015 data @xcite ( with combinations of high redshift supernovae of type ia , lensing , and baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) data ) .",
    "we follow certain specific procedures , in which we impose , for example , the condition that the effective hubble constant @xmath7 for our model to be within the @xmath8 confidence limits of the corresponding @xmath0cdm hubble constant @xmath9 , for a given dataset .",
    "this in principle enables us to work out the bounds on our model parameters , and hence on the quantities of interest , such as the non - minimal coupling parameter ( or equivalently , the effective bd parameter @xmath10 ) , and the torsion parameters ( that are taken to be lengths of the trace and and pseudo - trace mode vectors ) .",
    "although these bounds are approximate , not being derived via a full fledged likelihood analysis , they are of importance qualitatively ( and to some extent quantitatively ) in demonstrating the following :    a slowly dynamical de may result from even a small amount of torsion , via the coupling of the latter with a scalar field . as such , one may have an indirect observational signature of a fundamental theory ( e.g. string theory ) , if torsion or(and ) the scalar field is(are ) considered as low energy manifestation(s ) of the same .",
    "it suffices to consider only a mass term for the scalar field , and no other form of its potential , nor a cosmological constant , is necessary for the de model almost identical to @xmath0cdm .",
    "the scalar field mass ( or part thereof ) may effectively be due to the torsion pseudo - trace mode . hence the latter can play a significant role in the de evolution , as opposed to the trace mode of torsion .",
    "besides these , the very assumption of the weak dynamics of de gets independent support in both einstein and jordan frames , as the upper limit of the non - minimal coupling parameter turns out to quite low , implying a large lower limit of the effective bd parameter @xmath10 , consistent with the local gravity constraints on the latter @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : we start with the general discussion on the mst formalism in section [ sec : mst - gen ] , and in particular motivate the non - minimally coupled gravity - scalar field action in the riemann - cartan space - time .",
    "the standard cosmological setup for the mst coupling is described in section [ sec : mst - dust ] , in which the mst action is reduced to an equivalent scalar - tensor form by using the constraints on the torsion modes in a spatially flat frw universe .",
    "we also make propositions for a scalar field mass term out of the torsion pseudo - trace mode , and define the effective torsion mode parameters in jordan and einstein frames . in section [ sec : e - mst ] , we make a comprehensive study of the de evolution in the einstein frame .",
    "we work out first the appropriate cosmological solution for the same .",
    "then the parametric estimations are done using a comparative analysis , taking the six parameter base @xmath0cdm model as the reference .",
    "we follow two procedures that depend on the choice of the cosmological parameter(s ) relevant for determining the statistical bound on our model parameter . for different datasets , this",
    "bound is utilized to obtain the plots for various quantities of interest , and to study their characteristic difference with those for @xmath0cdm .",
    "finally , we work out the bounds on the torsion mode parameters and the effective bd parameter ( or , rather the parameter for the non - minimal coupling , from which the einstein frame cosmology stems out ) .",
    "a similar analysis is done in section [ sec : j - mst ] , for the jordan frame mst cosmology .",
    "the most striking feature we notice in the jordan frame is the effective crossing of the so - called  _ phantom barrier _ \" which leaves us in a ",
    "_ superaccelerating _ \" regime at the present epoch . for correlating the results of the analysis in einstein and jordan frames , we discuss in section [ sec : transf ] , the difference between our approach and that of the transformation of the model parameters ( and other derived quantities ) under the redefinition of length , mass and time in terms of the conformal factor .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary and some open questions in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "our notations and conventions are the following : the metric signature throughout is @xmath11 .",
    "we choose to work in units @xmath12 , whence the gravitational coupling factor is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the newton s constant .",
    "a subscript ` @xmath15 ' affixed to the cosmological quantities denotes the values of such quantities at the present epoch .",
    "the determinant of the metric tensor @xmath16 is denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "let us briefly review some important aspects of the four dimensional riemann - cartan ( @xmath5 ) space - time , which is characterized by an asymmetric affine connection @xmath18 .",
    "a detailed formalism can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the torsion tensor , defined by t^ _   : = 2 ^ _ [ ] ^ _ - ^ _ , can in general be decomposed as@xcite t^ _   = 1 3 ( ^ _ _ - ^ _ _ ) + 1 6 ^",
    "_   ^+ ^ _   , where @xmath19 is torsion _ trace _ vector mode , @xmath20 is the torsion _ pseudo - trace _ vector mode , and @xmath21 is the _ ( pseudo-)tracefree _ tensorial mode of torsion .    the @xmath5 curvature scalar is expressed as : = - 2 _ ^- 2 3 _ ^ + 1 24 _ ^+ 1 2 _",
    "^ where @xmath6 is the four dimensional riemannian ( @xmath22 ) curvature scalar , and @xmath23 denotes the usual @xmath22 covariant derivative defined in terms of the riemannian levi civita connection @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath5 covariant derivative @xmath25 , on the other hand , is defined in terms of the asymmetric connection @xmath26 , so that the metricity condition @xmath27 holds .",
    "our starting point is the action below , for the non - minimal @xmath5 coupling to a scalar field @xmath28 with a self - interacting potential @xmath29 : = d^4 x , where @xmath30 is a coupling parameter .",
    "such a non - minimal coupling may be motivated from the following :    in the four - dimensional minkowski ( @xmath31 ) space - time , with metric @xmath32 , the scalar field lagrangian given in the standard form _ ( ) = - 1 2 ^ _ _ - v ( ) , can equivalently be expressed , up to a divergence term , as  _",
    "( ) = 1 2 ^ _ _ - v ( ) . if the scalar field is coupled to the curvature terms in the riemannian ( @xmath22 ) space - time , then under the minimal coupling ( mc ) scheme ( @xmath33 ) the generalizations of @xmath34 and @xmath35 differ by a @xmath22 divergence term , and their equivalence is thus maintained .",
    "however , in the riemann - cartan ( @xmath5 ) space - time having torsion , the mc generalizations ( @xmath36 ) of the two forms of the lagrangian no longer remain equivalent , as their difference is not just a total divergence in @xmath5 , but in addition a term proportional to @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the choice of the lagrangian for a minimally coupled metric - scalar - torsion ( mst ) theory therefore becomes ambiguous .",
    "the remedy to this is to modify the overall mst action by including a term that would cancel the above additional term ( plus a total divergence at most ) .",
    "such a modification may require one to resort to the whole exercise of suitably generalizing the standard gibbons - hawking - york ( ghy ) boundary term in presence of the torsion and scalar degrees of freedom .",
    "as an alternative however , one may simply look beyond the mc prescription , and propose a mst action explicitly having a counter - term given as a contact interaction of the scalar field with the torsion trace mode action without any ambiguity when torsion is traceless , i.e. completely antisymmetric in its indices ( e.g. the one that is induced by the kalb - ramond field in the string - inspired scenarios ) . ] , or at least with its covariant derivative @xmath38 .",
    "now , it would seem quite a contrived setup if only the @xmath38 term is picked up among the host of terms in @xmath39 ( given by eq .",
    "( [ u4-curv ] ) ) and made to couple with the scalar field via a contact interaction .",
    "so to maintain regularity in the terms , we choose to couple the scalar field non - minimally to the entire @xmath5 lagangian @xmath40 in the equation ( [ u4-f - ac ] ) above .",
    "using now eq .",
    "( [ tor - decom ] ) we rewrite the mst action ( [ u4-f - ac ] ) , up to a divergence term , as = d^4 x , where we have considered the presence of other matter fields , such as fermionic matter or cosmological fluid matter , with lagrangian density @xmath41 .",
    "to study the cosmological consequences of the mst coupling , let us resort to the following widely accepted scenario :    the universe is homogeneous and isotropic at large scales , with the spatially flat frw metric structure ds^2 = - dt^2 + a^2 ( t ) ( dr^2 + r^2 d_2 ^ 2 ) , where @xmath42 is the comoving time coordinate , and @xmath43 is the cosmological scale factor .    the cosmological fluid matter is the pressureless _ dust _ , with energy density @xmath44 varying only with time . as is well - known , the frw metric describes a four - dimensional space - time foliated into three - dimensional maximally symmetric subspaces identified as hypersurfaces of constant time . for the maximal symmetry to be preserved in presence of torsion ,",
    "the latter gets constrained from the requirement of its form - invariance under such symmetry .",
    "an in - depth study in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) reveals that for determining such constraints on torsion , one may in principle resort to two schemes depending on whether torsion plays a passive or an active role in implementing the very concept of maximal symmetry . in one scheme , in which maximal symmetry is attributed solely to the metric properties of space - time , the frw metric structure restricts torsion to have at most four non - vanishing independent components , viz . @xmath45 and @xmath46 ,",
    "each of which can depend on time only . in the other scheme ,",
    "in which torsion directly affects maximal symmetry , following strictly the principle of general covariance , some more independent torsion components with only time - dependence , viz . @xmath47 and @xmath48 , are allowed in the frw context @xcite .",
    "hence , for the irreducible torsion modes , one finds that both the schemes are in agreement yielding @xmath49 and @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a pseudoscalar function of time .",
    "the disagreement comes when one scheme allows only the @xmath52 component of the torsion trace vector @xmath53 , whereas the other scheme allows all the components ( with some restrictions though ) .",
    "however , this is not a concern for us since we are considering the cosmological matter to be the non - relativistic dust , having no explicit dependence on torsion . as such , @xmath53 being an auxiliary field in the mst action ( [ mst - ac ] ) , satisfies the constraint equation _ = 3 , which when substituted , alongwith the constraint @xmath49 , back in eq .",
    "( [ mst - ac ] ) gives the on - shell action = d^4 x .",
    "this has an arbitrariness left in it though , viz . the choice of the scalar potential @xmath29 .",
    "now , in analogy with the gravitational field , torsion is conventionally taken to be massless @xcite . in the mst context",
    "therefore , since the scalar field @xmath28 acts as the source of the trace mode of torsion ( by virtue of the relation ( [ tr - eqn ] ) ) , one expects @xmath28 to be massless as well .",
    "we however make the allowance for @xmath28 to have a mass @xmath54 , i.e. v ( ) = 1 2 m_^2 ^2 .",
    "in fact , a scalar field mass term may be induced effectively in the frw space - time , at the expense of the torsion pseudo - trace mode @xmath55 , as demonstrated below .",
    "the above constraint @xmath50 can in principle be implemented in the theory by using a lagrange multiplier field @xmath56 .",
    "now , in the literature one often finds that phenomenological studies are done with the approximation of a constant ( or very weakly evolving ) torsion background @xcite . in the same spirit",
    "we may therefore make an additional assumption that the pseudoscalar @xmath57 is rolling so slowly that it may effectively be replaced with its average @xmath58 over a very large cosmological time - scale ( possibly stretching well past the redshift of last scattering @xmath59 , so that dust cosmologies would not get affected anyway ) .",
    "in other words , we invoke a modified constraint @xmath60 in the action ( [ mst - ac1 ] ) , by augmenting the latter with a lagrange multiplier term , the @xmath55-dependent part of ( [ mst - ac1 ] ) , with the augmentation , is then _",
    "= d^4 x . from this",
    ", it follows that in the frw space - time we have _ = - _ = ( , 0 , 0 , 0 ) , and the above part ( [ a - ac ] ) of the mst action written on - shell as _ = - dt d^3 x a^3(t ) .",
    "this resembles the action for the potential part of the scalar field @xmath28 representing effectively a mass , which is given by the constant = .",
    "such a mass - like term however has conformal properties different from that of the usual scalar field mass term ( [ scal - mass ] ) .",

    "the einstein - ther theories @xcite , in which a _ fixed _ expectation value for a time - like vector field ( dubbed  ther \" ) is enforced via a norm - fixing constraint , using a lagrange multiplier . for the torsion pseudo - trace vector @xmath55",
    ", we can implement a similar norm - fixing constraint _ ^= - ^2 , which , by the analogy of ther , would fix the field mode @xmath55 at an expectation value @xmath58 , supposedly in an underlying quantum theory of gravity ( with torsion ) .",
    "incorporating such a constraint in the action ( [ mst - ac1 ] ) , by the use of a lagrange multiplier @xmath63 , one gets the on - shell action similar to eq .",
    "( [ a - ac - on ] ) : _ = - d^4 x , with the mass @xmath64 given by eq .",
    "( [ ind - mass ] ) , but without any allusion to the frw ( or any other specific ) metric structure .",

    "explicit solutions of such equations enabled us to estimate the model parameters which quantify the state of cosmology at any given epoch .",
    "however , the question that remains is that if the solutions in one frame , say the jordan frame , are known , can we deduce the corresponding solutions in the other ( einstein ) frame without having to go through the tedious process of explicitly solving the field equations in that frame .",
    "we can indeed do that , but only with the knowledge of how the cosmic time , the scale factor and the scalar field and torsion parameters transform from one frame to the other .",
    "such transformations could be fixed by the relations ( [ conf ] ) and ( [ e - phi ] ) .",
    "the metric redefinition ( in terms of the conformal factor ) yields two independent equations which , in view of preserving the frw metric structure ( [ frw ] ) , defines the cosmic time and the scale factor in a transformed frame .",

    "in addition , one may verify that s = n n+2 .",
    "note again that the einstein frame quantities are marked with a ( @xmath181 ) over them .",
    "given an expression in one frame , the use of the above equations would lead to the corresponding expression in the other frame .",
    "the estimated upper bounds on the numerical values of the parameters @xmath120 and @xmath182 , shown respectively in the tables [ e - tab1 ] and [ j - tab1 ] , do not however comply with eq .",
    "( [ s_transf ] ) .",
    "this is expected , since such estimates have been made assuming either the einstein frame or the jordan frame as the physical frame in the respective analysis .",
    "this facilitated the use of the same observational data for computing the fractional errors @xmath154 and @xmath160 in each of the frames .",
    "the idea behind our approach in sections [ sec : e - mst ] and [ sec : j - mst ] has therefore been to differentiate between the physical viability of the two frames using the computed results .",
    "one could have taken the alternative route of appropriately scaling the observational data using the above transformation equations , considering the einstein and the jordan frames to be physically equivalent . however",
    ", that would inevitably have lead back to the longstanding problem of dealing with the running coupling constants in a physical theory .",
    "we have thus demonstrated that a non - minimal metric - scalar coupling with space - time torsion may lead to a self - consistent de model with slow dynamics .",
    "the latter of course complies with the requirement of not having much parametric distortion from the base @xmath0cdm model . such a requirement arizes naturally in view of ( i ) the wide observational support of @xmath0cdm ( despite its theoretical limitations ) , and ( ii ) the miniscule experimental signature of torsion in extensive researches till date .",
    "moreover , one has to get in an agreement with the high value of the lower bound on the effective brans - dicke parameter @xmath10 in the mst equivalent scalar - tensor theory .",
    "our analysis in sections [ sec : e - mst ] and [ sec : j - mst ] show that such a bound is indeed tenable in our non - minimal mst formalism in the standard cosmological setup .",
    "while the non - minimal coupling removes the ambiguity in choosing the mst action , one has to take into account the constraints on the torsion mode parameters for maintaining the frw metric structure .",
    "the result of course , is that the trace mode of torsion is sourced by the scalar field , which leaves us with the arbitrariness only in selecting the potential for the scalar .",
    "as it turned out , for an almost @xmath0cdm like de model , it suffices taking just a mass term for the scalar field .",
    "we have made propositions for such a scalar field mass ( or , at least a part of it ) out of torsion itself , in a way that the completely antisymmetric part of the latter gets eliminated via a suitably chosen constraint .",
    "thus overall , the mst action gets reduced to the scalar - tensor form , alongwith the potential of the scalar field given by its mass term , and the cosmological matter as the non - relativistic dust .",
    "now , a major obstacle in the scalar - tensor theory is to choose between the two frames , einstein and jordan , the  physical \" one for interpreting the observational results .",
    "one may of course consider the two frames to be physically equivalent , provided in one of them the units of length , time and mass are explicit functions of the scalar field ( and therefore time - varying ) @xcite .",
    "we have however discarded such a scenario ( on account of its feasibility ) , and have also taken the non - minimal coupling parameter @xmath30 to be positive definite ( so as to ensure that the underlying quantum theory is bounded from below ) .",
    "considering rigit sets of units in both the frames , our objective has been to carry out the analysis separately in the einstein frame ( supposing it to be the physical one ) , as well as in the jordan frame ( supposing it to be physical ) .",
    "this is of course a safeguard approach , in lieu of getting involved in the longstanding debate as to which frame is actually physical .    from the technical point of view ,",
    "instead of performing a likelihood analysis , we have stipulated that the cosmological parameters for our model to be kept within the @xmath183 confidence limits of the corresponding ones for a reference @xmath0cdm model .",
    "this enabled us a direct way of complying with the modern acceptance range of the present - day values of the cosmological parameters , via a reasonable order of magnitude estimation of the same .",
    "we have referred to two procedures of determining the statistical upper bound on our model parameter from the @xmath0cdm parametric marginalizations for a few recent datasets .",
    "such procedures have been followed in both the einstein frame and the jordan frame analysis in sections [ sec : e - mst ] and [ sec : j - mst ] respectively .",
    "what we have observed is that , even with the small parametric changes , there are significant characteristic differences of our model with @xmath0cdm .",
    "most notably , the effective eos parameter @xmath1 for dark energy in the jordan frame crosses over from a value @xmath184 to a value @xmath185 in the near past .",
    "it then reaches a minimum value , turns back but continues to remain below @xmath2 throughout the present and future evolution of the universe .",
    "such a crossing is usually not tenable in the scalar field models of de , e.g. quintessence or k - essence , unless there is(are ) _ ghost _ or _ phantom _",
    "degree(s ) of freedom involved , which bring(s ) in instabilities @xcite .",
    "however , in our case we have the effective cross - over to the _ phantom regime _ in a brans - dicke equivalent theory , which is at least stable against cosmological density perturbations @xcite .",
    "so unlike most of the scalar field de formulations , our mst cosmological setup in the jordan frame does not pre - assign a theoretical limitation for the statistical marginalization of the cosmological parameters using the observational data .",
    "another important aspect is that in the model - independent parametrizations of de , the phantom barrier crossing is actually favoured ( albeit mildly ) by the recent observational data .",
    "for example , the planck 2015 ( tt , te , ee + lowp + lensing + ext ) results @xcite show that @xmath1 given by the chavellier - polarsky - linder ( cpl ) ansatz @xcite , has the best fit value at the present epoch @xmath186 .",
    "one may check that estimations close to this value would indeed be obtained from our analysis in section [ sec : j - mst ] , for the same planck data ( i.e. the dataset @xmath187 in table [ j - tab1 ] ) , viz .",
    "@xmath188 ( corresponding to @xmath189 , by the procedure @xmath126 ) , and @xmath190 ( corresponding to @xmath191 , by the procedure @xmath177 ) .    finally , we should emphasize the high minimal estimates ( corresponding to the different datasets ) of the effective brans - dicke parameter @xmath10 , found in both the einstein frame and the jordan frame analysis in sections [ sec : e - mst ] and [ sec : j - mst ] ( see tables [ e - tab2 ] and [ j - tab2 ] ) .",
    "such high estimates are in agreement with the values obtained in many independent studies @xcite , which are therefore in support of our mst - de model .",
    "in fact , they also imply that the bd theory is not much of a deviation from gr . in our case",
    ", since we have the torsion field as one of key ingredients in the effective bd formulation , the high estimates of the lower limit of @xmath10 simply mean that the direct effects of the torsion modes on the space - time geometry are very weak .",
    "especially , for the late - time cosmologies , one always expects torsion to have a minor role .",
    "this is indeed reflected in the smallness of the upper limit on the present - day value of the torsion trace mode parameter shown in the tables [ e - tab2 ] and [ j - tab2 ] .",
    "so , the effective de evolution in our mst formalism must majorly be attributed to the effect of the coupling of torsion with the scalar field , or more appropriately , that of the mass of the scalar , whether due to the torsion pseudo - trace or otherwise .",
    "some open questions are in order : ( i ) what about the mathematical stability of the above formalism , i.e. against small fluctuations in the solution space ?",
    "( ii ) what about the stability against density perturbations ? ( iii ) what if the cosmological dust interacts in a very non - trivial way with torsion ?",
    "( iv ) what if we take some other cosmological fluid , e.g. chaplygin gas , instead of dust ?",
    "( v ) what if choose to consider the non - minimal coupling in some other form , or assign a dynamical source to the torsion pseudo - trace ( such as the kalb - ramond field ) ? works addressing a few of these are underway @xcite , which we hope to report soon .",

    "<S> the latter turns out to be fairly large , and in agreement with the local gravity constraints , which therefore come in support of our analysis .    </S>",
