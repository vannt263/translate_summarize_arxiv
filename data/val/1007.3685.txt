    "experimental analyses of neutrino induced coherent pion production generally rely on the rein ",
    "sehgal ( rs ) model  @xcite which is based on the partial conservation of the axial current ( pcac ) hypothesis . in the rs model",
    "the pion - nucleus coherent cross section is written in terms of the pion - nucleon elastic cross section by means of approximations that are valid for high neutrino energies and small values of the nucleus momentum transfer square and of the lepton momentum transfer square ( @xmath4 ) . as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , those approximations are less reliable for neutrino energies below / around 1 gev , light nuclei , like carbon or oxygen , and finite values of @xmath4 .",
    "these are the energies and targets used in present and forthcoming neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "there are other approaches to coherent production that do not rely on pcac but on microscopic models for pion production at the nucleon level  @xcite .",
    "the dominant contribution to the elementary amplitude at low energies is given by the @xmath5-pole mechanism ( @xmath5 excitation and its subsequent decay into @xmath6 ) .",
    "medium effects on the @xmath5 mass and width , final pion distortion , as well as nonlocalities in the pion momentum , are very important and are taken into account in microscopic calculations . similarly to pcac models , the process is dominated by the axial part of the weak current and it is thus very sensitive to nucleon - to - delta axial form factors .    very recently , the role of nonlocalities in the @xmath5 momentum has also been investigated  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is claimed that their neglect , the so called , local approximation , leads to an overestimate of the coherent production cross section that can be as large as a factor of 2 for neutrino energies of 500mev .",
    "similar results were obtained in ref .",
    "final pion distortion and in medium modifications of the @xmath5 properties were not considered , and it was not clear whether those approximations could not affect the results .",
    "final pion distortion and in medium modification of the @xmath5 properties were included in refs .",
    "@xcite , were nonlocal effects on the @xmath5 momentum were incorporated in the @xmath5 self - energy in the first - order approximation .",
    "they also observe a large reduction in the total cross section due to the nonlocal aspects of the @xmath5 propagation in the medium .",
    "however , as claimed by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , this that not mean that earlier microscopic calculations  @xcite are wrong , as there @xmath5 nonlocal effects are taken into account in an effective way through the in medium modification of the @xmath5 properties which were fitted to observables .    in the model we developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath5 was treated in the local approximation . however , the modifications of the @xmath5 in medium properties are such that similar models give a good reproduction of pionic atoms and @xmath7nucleus scattering  @xcite , pion photoproduction  @xcite , pion electroproduction  @xcite , ( @xmath8he , t )  @xcite and elastic @xmath9proton  @xcite reactions .",
    "we share the claim of the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite and we believe this treatment of the @xmath5 , where certainly non - local effects are being effectively ( partially ) taken into account , is also adequate for neutrino induced reactions .",
    "nevertheless , this interesting issue deserves future investigations .    our model in ref .",
    "@xcite is based on a microscopic model at the nucleon level , described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , that , besides the dominant @xmath5 pole contribution , takes into account background terms required by chiral symmetry . as a result of the inclusion of background terms",
    ", we had to re adjust the strength of the dominant @xmath5 pole contribution .",
    "the least known ingredients of the model are the axial nucleon - to-@xmath5 transition form factors of which @xmath0 , not only gives the largest contribution , but it also controls all other axial form factors if one assumes adler s model  @xcite that gives @xmath10 , and pcac is used to obtain @xmath11 .",
    "this strongly suggested to us the readjustment of @xmath0 to the experimental data .",
    "information on pion production off the nucleon comes mainly from two bubble chamber experiments , anl  @xcite and bnl  @xcite . assuming , as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath4 dependence @xmath12 , we fitted in ref .  @xcite the flux - averaged @xmath13 anl @xmath4-differential cross section for pion - nucleon invariant masses @xmath14 gev  @xcite obtaining @xmath15 and @xmath16 , with a gaussian correlation coefficient @xmath17 and a @xmath18 .",
    "the fitted axial mass was in good agreement with the estimates of about 0.95 gev and 0.84 gev given in refs .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath19 value is some 30% smaller than the prediction obtained from the off diagonal goldberger - treiman relation ( gtr ) that gives @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath19 is not constrained by chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath21pt ) and lattice calculations are still not conclusive about the size of possible violations of the gtr .",
    "for instance , though values for @xmath19 as low as 0.9 can be inferred in the chiral limit from the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , they also predict @xmath22 to be greater than one .",
    "recently , two re - analysis have been carried out trying to make compatible the gtr prediction for @xmath19 and anl data . in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath19 is kept to its gtr value and three additional parameters , that control the @xmath23 fall off , are fitted to the anl data .",
    "although anl data are well reproduced , we find the outcome in  @xcite to be unphysical , as it provides a quite pronounced @xmath24dependence giving rise to a too large axial transition radius of around 1.4 fm ( further details are discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "a second re - analysis  @xcite brings in the discussion two interesting points .",
    "first that both anl and bnl data were measured in deuterium , and second , the uncertainties in the neutrino flux normalization . it is claimed in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the latter could be responsible for bnl total cross sections being systematically larger than anl ones . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors do a combined best fit to the anl and bnl data including deuteron effects , which they evaluate as in ref .",
    "@xcite , and flux normalization uncertainties , treated as systematic errors , and taken to be 20% for anl data and",
    "10% for bnl data . with a pure dipole dependence for @xmath0",
    ", they found @xmath25 , in agreement with the gtr estimate .    the works in refs .",
    "@xcite consider only the @xmath26 pole mechanism but ignore the sizable non - resonant contributions which are of special relevance for neutrino energies below 1 gev .",
    "when background terms are considered , the tension between anl data and the gtr prediction for @xmath19 substantially increases as the results in ref .",
    "@xcite clearly shows .    in our work in ref .",
    "@xcite we have performed a fit to both anl and bnl data in which : _",
    "i ) _ we have included the bnl total @xmath27 cross section measurements of ref .",
    "we have just included the three lowest neutrino energies : 0.65 , 0.9 and 1.1 gev , since there is no cut in the outgoing pion - nucleon invariant mass in the bnl data , and we want to avoid heavier resonances from playing a significant role .",
    "we have not used the bnl measurement of the @xmath24differential cross section , since it lacked an absolute normalization . _",
    "ii ) _ we have taken into account deuteron effects , _ iii ) _ the uncertainties in the neutrino flux normalizations , 20% for anl and 10% for bnl data , are treated as fully correlated systematic errors , improving thus the simpler treatment adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite , and finally _ iv ) _ in some fits , we have relaxed adler s model constraints , in order to extract some direct information on @xmath28 . for simplicity we took @xmath29 . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the consideration of bnl data and flux uncertainties increased the value of @xmath19 by about 9% , while strongly reduced the statistical correlations between @xmath19 and @xmath30 .",
    "the inclusion of background terms reduced @xmath19 by about 13% , and deuteron effects increased it by about 5% , consistently with the results of @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "fitted data was quite insensitive to @xmath28 .    in our most robust fit in ref .",
    "@xcite we used adler s constraints , and we obtained @xmath31 , with a small gaussian correlation coefficient @xmath32 and a @xmath33 .",
    "this violation of the gtr is about 15% , and it is smaller than that suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , though it is definitely greater than that claimed in ref .",
    "@xcite , mostly because in ref .",
    "@xcite background terms were not considered .",
    "however , the gtr value and the @xmath19 above differ in less than @xmath34 , and the discrepancy is even smaller if adler s constraints are removed .",
    "these new results are quite relevant for the neutrino induced coherent pion production in nuclei which is a low @xmath4 dominated reaction .",
    "background term contributions to coherent production largely cancel for symmetric nuclei  @xcite making the @xmath5 pole mechanism the unique contribution . as the process",
    "is dominated by the axial part of the weak current , it is very sensitive to @xmath19 .",
    "thus , we would expect the results in ref .",
    "@xcite , based in the determination of @xmath19 of ref .",
    "@xcite , to underestimate cross sections by some 30% . in this work",
    "we re - evaluate different pion coherent production observables using our model of ref .  @xcite",
    "but with the new parameterization and results for @xmath0 obtained in ref .",
    "as the correlation coefficient is small in this case , we shall treat the theoretical errors that derive from the uncertainties in @xmath19 and @xmath30 as independent and we shall add them in quadratures .",
    "we start by showing in the left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : flux - cross ] the differential cross section with respect to the @xmath35 variable for neutral current ( nc ) coherent @xmath36 production on carbon .",
    "@xmath37 is the pion energy in the laboratory frame ( lab ) while @xmath38 is the lab angle between the pion and the incoming neutrino .",
    "the shapes of the distributions are completely similar to the ones we obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the absolute values increase by some 20%@xmath1 30% depending on the neutrino energy .",
    "this is generally true for other differential cross sections that we do not show here . for the distribution convoluted with the miniboone flux we find an increase in the total cross section of about 29% .    .nc",
    "/ cc @xmath39 and @xmath40 coherent pion production total cross sections , with errors , for k2k , miniboone and t2k experiments . in the case of cc k2k , the experimental threshold for the muon momentum @xmath41 450 mev is taken into account .",
    "details on the flux convolution are compiled in the last three columns . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in table  [ tab : res ] we show our new predictions for , both nc and charged current ( cc ) processes , for the k2k  @xcite and miniboone  @xcite flux averaged cross sections as well as for the future t2k experiment . in the middle and right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : flux - cross ] , we show some results for t2k and miniboone experiments . in all cases ,",
    "the flux @xmath42 is normalized to one . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , and since we neglect all resonances above the @xmath43 , we have set up a maximum neutrino energy ( @xmath44 ) in the flux convolution , approximating the convoluted cross section by @xmath45 , where we fixed the upper limit in the integration to @xmath46gev and 1.34 gev for cc and nc @xmath47 driven processes , respectively .",
    "@xmath48 is the lower flux limit . for the k2k case a threshold of 450 mev for muon momentum",
    "is also implemented  @xcite and we can to go up to @xmath49=1.8 gev .",
    "we cover about 90% of the total flux in most of the cases . for the t2k antineutrino flux ,",
    "we cover just about 65% , and therefore our results are less reliable .",
    "our central value cross sections increase by some 23%@xmath130% , while the errors associated to the uncertainties in the @xmath19 and @xmath30 determination are of the order of 21% .",
    "our new results are thus compatible with former ones in ref .",
    "@xcite within @xmath2 .",
    "our prediction for the k2k experiment lies more than 1@xmath50 below the k2k upper bound , while we still predict an nc miniboone cross section notably smaller than that given in the phd thesis of j.l .",
    "raaf  @xcite .",
    "note however , that the miniboone collaboration has not given an official value for the total coherent cross section yet , and only the ratio coherent/(coherent+incoherent ) has been presented  @xcite . for the future t2k experiment",
    ", we now get cross sections of the order 2.4@xmath513.2@xmath52@xmath53 in carbon and about 2.9@xmath513.8 @xmath54@xmath53 in oxygen .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross ] we show new @xmath55 cc and nc coherent pion production total cross sections off carbon and oxygen targets . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we observe sizable corrections to the approximate relation @xmath56 for these two isoscalar nuclei in the whole range of @xmath57 energies examined . as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , this is greatly due to the finite muon mass , and thus the deviations are dramatic at low neutrino energies . in any case , these corrections can not account for the apparent incompatibility among the cc k2k cross section and the nc value quoted in ref .  @xcite .    the sciboone collaboration has just reported a measurement of nc @xmath36 production on carbon by a @xmath39 beam with average energy",
    "0.8gev  @xcite .",
    "based on previous measurements of cc coherent @xmath58 production  @xcite , they conclude that @xmath59 .",
    "this result can not be accommodated within our model , or any other present theoretical model , neither microscopic  @xcite nor pcac based  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , this ratio can not be much smaller than 1.4 - 1.6 .",
    "for instance , for a carbon target and for a neutrino energy of 0.8gev we find a value of @xmath60 for that ratio , ten times bigger that the value given by the sciboone collaboration . from the @xmath61 cc and nc miniboone convoluted results shown in table  [ tab : res ] , we obtain @xmath62 .",
    "we believe this huge discrepancy with the sciboone result stems form the use in ref .",
    "@xcite of the rs model to estimate the ratio between nc coherent @xmath36 production and the total cc pion production . as clearly shown in refs .",
