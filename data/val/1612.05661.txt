    "the motion of spin bearing particles can be studied by the judicial use of pulsed magnetic field gradients in nmr experiments  @xcite . pulsed gradient spin echo ( pgse ) nmr is best known for diffusion measurements in porous media as well as for velocimetry studies  @xcite .",
    "the potential of pgse nmr for nmr microscopy has been demonstrated with the appearance of diffraction patterns when self - diffusion was studied in a bead pack sample  @xcite .",
    "magnetic resonance pore imaging ( mrpi ) is a recent advancement in pgse nmr which dramatically increases the resolution as compared to mri for suitable closed pore systems  @xcite .",
    "mrpi relies on a weak gradient pulse which can be several hundreds of milliseconds long . during this gradient pulse",
    "the nuclear spins have to be kept in the transverse plane  @xcite .",
    "we suggested therefore a cpmg based design in order to refocus the internal gradients and other experimental imperfections  @xcite .",
    "however , the introduction of many rf - pulses in the presence of magnetic field gradients leads to a complicated coherence pathway spectrum  @xcite .",
    "this may not always be a problem in cpmg relaxation studies , since the decay due to transverse relaxation is still obtained  @xcite . in mrpi",
    "however , it is essential to preserve the spin phase throughout the rf - pulse train , while the unwanted pathways do interfere adversely  @xcite . since traditional phase cycling techniques proved impractical for our cpmg pulse sequence design , it was necessary to explore alternative ways to filter for the correctly encoded signal",
    "this study focuses on the application of a novel phase cycling technique called phase incremented echo train acquisition ( pieta )  @xcite .    in pulsed nmr the spectrum of coherence pathways ( cps )",
    "is multiplied with each additional rf - pulse  @xcite .",
    "this creates a very rich spectrum of cps , where each cp contains specific information which is influenced by its history since excitation .",
    "since each coherence may experience different physical interactions , it is paramount to select the right cps of the spin system under study .",
    "the most popular strategy to achieve this selection involves the nested cycling of the rf - pulse phases and the receiver phase from scan to scan according to a master equation  @xcite .",
    "however , the number of cps grows exponentially with the number of rf - pulses and finding the right phase cycling scheme may become complicated . throughout the article we consider a spin-@xmath0 system without coupling between the individual spins and where the desired cp does not involve any @xmath1-storage . in this case , an nmr pulse sequence with @xmath2 rf - pulses would need @xmath3 phase steps following the nested phase cycling scheme  @xcite .",
    "several algorithms were designed to solve this problem with the help of computer programs  @xcite .",
    "two other widely applied strategies are improved perfection of the spin rotations induced by specially designed rf - pulses  @xcite and the application of pulsed field gradients  @xcite",
    ". these two latter strategies can reduce the complexity of the problem , but they are often harder to implement or face limitations due to the available hardware .",
    "especially the carr - purcell - meiboom - gill ( cpmg ) nmr pulse sequence  @xcite and its derivatives can contain several hundreds or even thousands of rf - pulses and the number of phase steps with traditional phase cycling would be forbiddingly high .",
    "a first solution emerged with the development of cogwheel phase cycling which when applied to cpmg like pulse trains promised significant reductions in the number of phase steps needed  @xcite . when cogwheel is applied to cpmg the receiver phases have to be cycled such that they span a @xmath4 angle range after @xmath5 acquisitions , where @xmath5 is the number of @xmath6 rf - pulses  @xcite .",
    "this renders this method appealing for experiments with a fixed number of rf - pulses .",
    "however , in the case of cpmg echo trains with a variable number of rf - pulses it would require as many independent measurements ( including the cogwheel phase cycle ) as different numbers of rf - pulses have been chosen .",
    "a recent approach called phase incremented echo train acquisition ( pieta ) offers the extraction of all echoes in a given rf - pulse train and a de - convolution of the contributing coherence pathways with the same number of scans as cogwheel  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", pieta is utilized to investigate the coherence pathway spectrum contributing to the spin echo signal of mrpi .",
    "furthermore , it is shown how the artifact free coherence pathway can be selected .",
    "in nmr experiments the desired information is usually contained in one specific coherence pathway ( cp ) @xmath7 or a small subset @xmath8 of all cps  @xcite . the values @xmath9 denote the coherence order of the spins after the @xmath10-th rf - pulse of the nmr pulse sequence .",
    "the elements @xmath9 can assume integer values which are determined by the spin quantum number @xmath11 and the coupling between multiple spins . for a system of uncoupled spin-@xmath0 nuclei the values of @xmath9 can be @xmath12 and @xmath13 . it is assumed that every cp starts from a well defined equilibrium with @xmath14 ( associated with magnetization in @xmath1-direction ) before the first rf - pulse . for a cp to be measured with quadrature nmr detection it has to end with @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "the magnetization of all three levels @xmath16 is mixed with each additional rf - pulse giving rise to a large number of cps growing exponentially with @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the number of rf - pulses  @xcite .",
    "the complex nmr signal for a single scan with scan counter @xmath19 can be expressed as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the signal arising from a specific coherence pathway @xmath22 after the last rf - pulse .",
    "@xmath23 denotes the final phase with which the cp is recorded in the spectrometer memory and it is given by  @xcite @xmath24 here , @xmath25 are the phases of the @xmath10-th rf - pulse and @xmath26 is the coherence transfer difference induced with the @xmath10-th rf - pulse .",
    "the signal after @xmath27 scans can be expressed as the complex sum given by    @xmath28    where we inserted eq .",
    "[ eq : signal ] in the first step and in the second step we used the fact that @xmath21 does not depend on @xmath19 .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "[ eq : signal_all_scans ] shows that each individual cp signal is multiplied by the sum of phase factors added over all @xmath27 scans .",
    "thus , in order to filter any desired pathway @xmath22 after @xmath27 scans , the following condition has to be full - filled @xmath29 the most popular strategies to achieve this condition are the nested phase cycling approach  @xcite and cogwheel phase cycling scheme  @xcite . both methods involve the design of a set of @xmath30 for each scan @xmath19 and to cycle the receiver phase @xmath31 such that the wanted cp is always recorded with the same phase , while all other cps cycle in phase and cancel upon completion of the full set of scans . in the case of many rf - pulses , such as they are common in cpmg type experiments ,",
    "these methods are hard to apply because of the shear number of cps and they do not provide any extra information about the importance of the unwanted cps .    a different concept was proposed with multiplex phase cycling  @xcite where each scan is recorded separately in the spectrometer memory and the wanted cps are selected in a post - processing step .",
    "it will be shown in the next section how pieta is similar to both multiplexing and cogwheel phase cycling .",
    "baltisberger et al .",
    "@xcite introduced a new phase cycling scheme which allows one to extract the direct cp from echo train acquisition ( eta ) experiments .",
    "the authors use eta as a general expression for a train of spin echos due to a train of rf - pulses , which can be appended to an nmr experiment or may represent a stand - alone experiment like cpmg . this novel approach was called phase incremented echo train acquisition ( pieta ) , because the phase of every other refocusing pulse is incremented as a single variable @xmath32 from scan to scan.[pp : one_echo ] note that the application of pieta in this contribution slightly deviates from the use cases suggested by baltisberger _",
    "@xcite . instead of recording many spin echo amplitudes for each scan , here only one spin echo",
    "is recorded at the end of the rf - pulse train for each scan as will be explained below .",
