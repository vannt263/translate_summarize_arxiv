    "the degasperis - procesi ( dp ) equation @xcite @xmath0 belongs to a class of one - dimensional wave equations which have attracted considerable attention over the last decade , following the most studied equation in this class , namely , the camassa - holm ( ch ) equation @xcite @xmath1 both these equations can be derived from the governing equations under the assumption of moderate amplitude @xcite .",
    "what makes them special is that , on one hand , both are lax integrable , on the other , both exhibit wave breaking phenomenon not captured by linear theory or shallow water , small amplitude theory like the korteweg - devries equation .",
    "the most relevant to this paper study of the breakdown of solutions for the ch equation was done by h.p .",
    "mckean @xcite . in these works",
    ", it was argued that the breakdown of the ch waves is controlled by a kind of caricature of the higher dimensional vorticity , namely , @xmath2 ( see @xcite ) . in particular , it is the initial relative position of regions with positive @xmath3 versus negative @xmath3 that signals whether the breakdown will happen at some later , finite , time .",
    "one of the fascinating aspects of both the ch and dp equations is the existence of special solutions , peakons , which play the role of basic building blocks of the underlying full theory .",
    "peakons are a simple superposition of exponential terms @xmath4 for which the function @xmath3 referred to earlier is @xmath5 .",
    "were we to take the analogy with vorticity at its face value , @xmath3 for peakons could be viewed as a collection of point vortices , situated at @xmath6s , of strength @xmath7 each , initially ordered in some fixed way , say , @xmath8 .",
    "the case of ch peakons shows that if the strengths @xmath9 are not of the same sign then _ collisions _ can occur , meaning that @xmath10 for some @xmath11 and some time @xmath12 .",
    "each collision is accompanied by a blow - up of @xmath13 and @xmath14 resulting in the derivative @xmath15 becoming unbounded even though @xmath16 remains bounded , in fact continuous . thus peakons can be used to test ideas about wave breaking , the advantage being that the peakon dynamics is described by a finite system of odes ( see section [ sec : basic ] ) .",
    "the analysis of the ch peakon collisions in this case was done in @xcite with the help of explicit formulas . in short , the ch peakon problem can be solved by stieltjes formulas involving continued fractions @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the underlying boundary value problem is self - adjoint , in fact it is equivalent to an inhomogeneous string which remains isospectral under the ch flow .",
    "the case of the dp equation is superficially similar to the ch case .",
    "however , deeper analysis shows a remarkable number of new features .",
    "for example , the associated spectral problem , termed a cubic string in @xcite , is not self - adjoint and this has the immediate consequence that the inverse problem is by far more involved .",
    "the peakon problem in the case of the positive measure , that is when all weights @xmath17s are positive , was solved explicitly in @xcite . however , the generalization to the case of a signed measure @xmath3 is not straightforward since the spectral data breaks up into several types depending on the degeneracy of the spectrum , as well as on certain coincidental phenomena of anti - resonances ( eigenvalues @xmath18 pairing according to @xmath19 ) .",
    "by contrast , the distinction between peakons for positive measure @xmath3 and peakons for the signed measure @xmath3 is less sharp for the ch case where the formulas for peakons can be analytically continued from former to latter .",
    "this is not so for the dp case .",
    "this difficulty notwithstanding , in a way analogous to what happens in the ch case , the presence of a collision signals an occurrence of wave breaking ; in the dp context the connection between wave breaking and peakon collisions was studied earlier by h. lundmark in @xcite for the case @xmath20 and further by the present authors in @xcite for @xmath21 .",
    "important questions of stability and general analytic results dealing with dp peakons and the dp wave breaking have been addressed in @xcite .",
    "a considerable amount of work has been also done on adapting numerical schemes to deal with the dp equation ; we just mention a few : an operator splitting method of feng and liu @xcite , or numerical schemes discussed by coclite , karlsen and risebro in @xcite .",
    "the dp equation , in contrast to the ch equation , admits shock solutions ( see @xcite for a general , very thorough , discussion ) .",
    "it was h. lundmark who introduced the concept of shockpeakons @xmath22 for which @xmath23 and showed that the solution describing a collision of two peakons has a unique entropy extension to shockpeakons .",
    "he also hypothesized that this might be a general phenomenon valid also for @xmath24 .",
    "we prove his conjecture .",
    "more precisely we prove that the distributional limit of @xmath3 at the collision point @xmath12 indeed produces shockpeakon data with positive shock strengths @xmath25 thus allowing a unique entropy weak extension ( see theorem [ thm : shocks ] and corollary [ cor : shocks ] ) .",
    "let us briefly describe our strategy . instead of analyzing numerous spectral types we concentrate on analytic properties of @xmath26 as functions of @xmath27 .",
    "to this end we analyze the inverse spectral problem for the cubic string with the input data of a finite , signed measure .",
    "we prove that each @xmath6 must be a holomorphic function at @xmath12 , while @xmath7 is in general only meromorphic ( theorem [ thm : merocentral ] ) .",
    "then we perform singularity analysis of the odes describing peakons and prove their painlev property with the help of theorems [ thm : merocentral ] and [ thm : pain ] followed by a singularity analysis at the time of collisions described by theorem [ thm : leadingcoef ] .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : we review basic facts about the dp equation in section [ sec : basic ] , in section [ sec : ip ] we discuss the inverse problem for peakons of both signs generalizing the uniqueness result known from the pure peakon case @xcite and use this result to establish analytic properties of positions @xmath28s and masses @xmath17s . in section [ sec : blowup ] we analyze the singular behaviour at the time of collisions and establish a universal singularity pattern according to which , in the leading term , only the time of the blowup depends on the initial conditions not the residue .",
    "this fact is proven in theorem [ thm : leadingcoef ] .",
    "we furthermore rule out triple collisions in theorem [ thm : notriple ] , and give an example of a simultaneous collision , in different positions , of two peakon - antipeakon pairs ; finally in section [ sec : shocks ] we prove theorem [ thm : shocks ] stating that the distributional limit of colliding peakons is indeed a shockpeakon .",
    "the nonlinear equation @xmath29 often written as @xmath30 was introduced by degasperis and procesi @xcite as an example of a nonlinear partial differential equation satisfying asymptotic integrability appearing in the family of third order dispersive equations : @xmath31 other examples of integrable equations in this family are the korteweg - devries equation ( kdv ) and the camassa - holm ( ch ) equation .",
    "formal integrability for the dp equation was established by degasperis , holm and hone @xcite through the construction of a lax pair and a bi - hamiltonian structure . in particular ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the dp equation admits the lax pair : @xmath32\\psi.\\ ] ] moreover , one can impose additional boundary conditions provided they do not violate the compatibility of these equations .",
    "one such a pair of boundary conditions was introduced in @xcite : @xmath33 where it was also shown that the spectrum of this boundary value problem will remain time invariant ( isospectral deformation ) .",
    "it suffices for our purposes to restrict our attention to the case in which @xmath3 is a finite discrete ( signed ) measure .",
    "thus for the remainder of the paper we will use the _ multipeakon _ ansatz @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 can have both positive and negative values .",
    "this ansatz produces @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , with the proper interpretation of weak solutions to equation we can easily check that @xmath38 is a weak solution to provided @xmath39 satisfy the following odes    [ eq : b - ode - short ] @xmath40    where @xmath41 $ ] is the average of @xmath42 at the point @xmath43 .",
    "we will refer to @xmath17s as _ masses _ to emphasize their role in the spectral problem .",
    "we also need a bit of terminology regarding the phenomenon of breaking .",
    "we will say that a _ collision _ occurred at some time @xmath12 if @xmath44 for some @xmath45 .",
    "we can make this concept more geometric by introducing a configuration space in which to study peakon solutions , namely the sector @xmath46",
    ". then a collision corresponds to the solution @xmath47 hitting the boundary of @xmath48 .    a very useful property of equations is the existence of @xmath49 constants of motion .",
    "this follows readily from theorem 2.10 in @xcite .",
    "[ lem : constants ] @xmath50 , given by : @xmath51}\\choose p}\\left(\\prod_{i\\in i}m_i\\right)\\left(\\prod_{j=1}^{p-1}(1-e^{x_{i_j}-x_{i_{j+1}}})^2\\right)\\ ] ] are @xmath49 constants of motion of the system of equations , where @xmath52}{p}$ ] is the set of all @xmath53-element subsets @xmath54 of @xmath55 .",
    "the boundary value value problem and can be transformed to a finite interval boundary value problem , the cubic string problem . indeed , following @xcite , the change of variables ( liouville transformation ) @xmath56 maps the dp spectral problem into the cubic string problem :    [ eq : cubicstring ] @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the transformation of the measure",
    "@xmath3 induced by the liouville transformation .",
    "furthermore , as one can explicitly check , @xmath58 is also a finite signed measure and its support does not include the endpoints if the original measure @xmath3 is a finite signed measure .",
    "more concretely , in this paper , @xmath59 with weights @xmath60",
    ". the inverse problem is studied with the help of two weyl functions .",
    "[ def : wz ] let @xmath61 denote the solution to the initial value problem with initial conditions @xmath62 .",
    "the weyl functions are ratios : @xmath63    these two functions encode spectral information needed to solve the inverse problem .",
    "it is easy to verify that in the case of both @xmath64 and @xmath65 are rational functions which makes inversion algebraic .",
    "however , in contrast to the pure peakon case @xmath66 , the spectrum of the boundary value problem is in general complex and not necessarily simple .",
    "this makes the inversion more challenging .",
    "regardless of the complexity of the spectrum though the weyl functions undergo a simple evolution under the dp flow .",
    "indeed , using the second member of the lax pair given by one can find the time evolution of @xmath67 and @xmath65 . to wit ,",
    "using results from theorem 2.3 in @xcite we obtain the following characterization of the time evolution of @xmath67 and @xmath65 .",
    "let @xmath68 be the partial fraction decomposition of @xmath69 , where @xmath70 denotes the algebraic degeneracy of the @xmath11-th eigenvalue .",
    "then the dp time evolution implies :    1 .",

    "2 .   @xmath74 .",
    "3 .   @xmath75    we immediately have :    [ cor : wzflow ] under the dp flow the weyl functions @xmath76 are entire functions of time .",
    "the uniqueness result below plays a major role in the solution to the inverse problem .",
    "suppose @xmath77 is the map that associates to the cubic string problem with a finite signed measure @xmath58 , the weyl functions @xmath78 .",
    "then @xmath79 is injective .",
    "the proof relies on remarks made in @xcite .",
    "we will construct a recursive scheme to solve the inverse spectral problem ; given @xmath80 and @xmath81 obtained from the map @xmath79 we will reconstruct the finite , signed measure @xmath58 whose weyl functions are @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "more precisely , we will show that the @xmath82 s and @xmath83 s in equation are uniquely determined from @xmath78 .",
    "first we recall that @xmath80 and @xmath81 are constructed from solutions to the initial value problem ( see definition [ def : wz ] )    [ eq : stringivp ] @xmath84    masses @xmath83 are situated at @xmath85 and for convenience let us set @xmath86 and denote by @xmath87 the length of the interval @xmath88 .",
    "then on each interval @xmath88 the solution to ( [ eq : stringivp ] ) takes the form @xmath89 and the condition of crossing @xmath90 is : continuity of @xmath91 and @xmath92 and the jump condition @xmath93 .",
    "we establish , for example by an easy induction , @xmath94 valid for @xmath95 , with the convention that for @xmath96 the product equals @xmath97 and there is no remainder .",
    "likewise , @xmath98 valid for @xmath99",
    ".    for @xmath100 we define @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "these quantities are essentially the left hand and the right hand analogs of weyl functions introduced in definition [ def : wz ] and correspond to shorter strings terminating at @xmath90 with no mass at the endpoint , or terminating at @xmath82 but with the mass @xmath83 at the end .",
    "equation implies that the sequence @xmath103 satisfies the recurrence relations @xmath104 the iteration starts at @xmath105 and terminates at @xmath106 .",
    "moreover , based on equations and , we easily establish    @xmath107    which implies that the quantities @xmath108 are determined in each step from the large @xmath109 asymptotics of terms known from the previous step .",
    "indeed , if we denote by @xmath110 the coefficient of @xmath111 in the expansion of a holomorphic function @xmath112 at @xmath113 we obtain the recovery formulas @xmath114 thus we proved that given a pair of weyl functions @xmath78 obtained from a cubic string problem with a finite , signed measure @xmath58 , there exists a unique solution to the recurrence relations subject to and thus a unique cubic string corresponding to @xmath78 .",
    "we are now ready to state the central theorem of this section    [ thm : merocentral ] let @xmath115 be the positions and masses of the peakon ansatz corresponding to an arbitrary signed measure @xmath116 , satisfying peakon equations on the time interval @xmath117 and suppose that a collision occurs at @xmath12 . then the positions @xmath118 are analytic functions at @xmath12 , while the masses @xmath119 are given by meromorphic functions at @xmath12 .    given the initial conditions @xmath120 and + @xmath121 we set up the string problem after mapping @xmath122 to @xmath123 .",
    "this produces the weyl functions @xmath124 , which under the peakon flow evolve as entire functions of time in view of corollary [ cor : wzflow ] .",
    "we then set up the recursive scheme with @xmath125 as inputs . at each stage of recursion only rational operations are involved and since the recursion is finite the formulas result in functions meromorphic in @xmath27 .",
    "thus all @xmath126 are meromorphic in @xmath27 . for @xmath127",
    "all distances @xmath128 and at @xmath12 some @xmath129 vanishes but all @xmath130 remain finite , because this is a finite string .",
    "hence @xmath131 is regular at @xmath12 hence analytic there . for a signed measure @xmath58",
    "there are no bounds restrictions on individual @xmath83 so in general @xmath83 remains meromorphic at @xmath12 .",
    "mapping back to the real axis is afforded by @xmath132 ; hence positions of individual masses are given by @xmath133 .",
    "the only singular points of this map are for @xmath134 which means the end of the string or , after mapping the problem back to the real axis , @xmath135 . however ,",
    "based on results in @xcite , none of the masses can escape to @xmath135 in finite time .",
    "so @xmath136 is in the domain of analyticity of @xmath137 and hence the @xmath28s are analytic at @xmath12 .",
    "the relation between the measures @xmath3 and @xmath58 appearing in equations and is given by @xmath138 which implies the claim since @xmath83 is meromorphic and @xmath82 analytic .",
    "the above theorem establishes that the only singular points of solutions to the peakon ode system and are poles . since the inverse problem argument is valid for a fixed ordering @xmath139 of masses , the analytic continuation of masses and positions into the complex domain in @xmath27 will satisfy equations and in which @xmath140 are replaced with @xmath141 , @xmath142 respectively , to be consistent with the original ordering .",
    "it is for these equations that we note the _ absence of movable critical points _ also known as",

    "[ painlev property ] [ thm : pain ] the system of differential equations @xmath145 has the painlev property .",
    "first we observe ( using the variables of the proof of theorem [ thm : merocentral ] ) that @xmath146 , hence @xmath147s are meromorphic in @xmath27 because so are @xmath148s .",
    "the formulas for @xmath147s and @xmath149s obtained from the inverse problem are meromorphic in @xmath27 in the complex plane @xmath150 and depend on @xmath151 constants ( spectral data consisting , in the generic case , of @xmath49 positions of poles and @xmath49 residues of the weyl function @xmath80 ) , which for the cubic string problem , in view of the ordering condition , are confined to an open set in @xmath152 by continuity of the inverse spectral map .",

    "we now proceed to establish several theorems on peakon collisions for dp equation . to begin with we recall the definition of a peakon collision briefly discussed in the introduction .",
