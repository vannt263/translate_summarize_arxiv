    "precise calculations of the qcd cross - sections for the lhc are based on the factorization procedure .",
    "it allows to divide the entire collision process into separate parts : ( 1 ) the non - perturbative initial distribution of partons in the incoming protons , to be taken from experiments in form of the parton density functions ( pdfs ) ; ( 2 ) the actual parton showers ( pss ) , both in the initial and final states , described by the evolution equations resulting from the resummed perturbative calculations ; ( 3 ) the hard scattering calculated perturbatively to a fixed order and ( 4 ) the non - perturbative hadronization of partons , described by phenomenological models .",
    "a few approaches to the factorization , amongst which the collinear factorization , well founded in the field theory , is the most popular one .",
    "let us recall a few milestones in its development .",
    "the first , lo , resummations , dated to the early 1970s , are due to gribov , lipatov , altareli , parisi and dokshitzer @xcite .",
    "the general theorem has been addressed in the papers of ellis , georgi , machacek , politzer and ross @xcite with the help of the axial gauge in which the appealing ladder - like structure of the singularities has been proven .",
    "the practical calculations of the nlo kernels were done by floratos , ross and sachrajda @xcite and then by kalinowski , konishi and others @xcite , based on the operator product expansion as well as by curci , furmanski and petronzio @xcite in diagrammatic approach in dimensionally regularized ms scheme .",
    "further reformulations of the factorization scheme were due to collins , soper , sterman @xcite , bodwin @xcite and others in 1980s . finally , twenty years later , the nnlo kernels have been calculated by moch , vermaseren and vogt @xcite .",
    "all the above papers concern the analytical results .",
    "the monte carlo ( mc ) implementations , i.e.  the ps programs , used in the actual data analysis were developed in a different pace .",
    "the first implementations : pythia @xcite and herwig @xcite , based on the ( improved ) lo calculations , were created in mid-1980s and systematically developed since then .",
    "the next step ",
    "the complete nlo - based simulations have not been constructed yet , despite the fact that the analytical results are known for more than 30 years ! there are two half - way solutions : mc@nlo @xcite and powheg @xcite which combine the nlo hard matrix element with the lo - type ps ( lo evolution ) .",
    "so far a lo accuracy of the mc programs was satisfactory in the data analysis , as compared to the experimental precision of the hadronic experiments .",
    "however , with the start - up of the lhc the situation has changed .",
    "the generic expected experimental precision of lhc results is of the order of 1% , and to match this precision the mc simulations must be of the nlo type at least .    the goal of the krkmc project @xcite developed in krakw is to fill in precisely this gap and to construct for the first time the complete nlo - level ps program for qcd . in the following , after a short introduction to the collinear factorization",
    ", we will briefly describe the four main ingredients of the krkmc project : the extended , exclusive collinear factorization scheme , the new lo ps scheme , exclusive nlo corrections to the hard process and exclusive corrections to the ladder part .    in the results presented here some simplifications are temporarily present : only non - singlet kernels are included in the evolution ,",
    "only @xmath0 hard process is included and non - running @xmath1 is used .",
    "the standard collinear factorization rearranges the squared matrix element into a sum of two - particle - irreducible universal kernels @xmath2 , and a process - dependent function @xmath3 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ drelly ] for the drell - yan type process ( use of the physical gauge is instrumental here ! ) .",
    "the collinear singularities are located in the @xmath2 functions . at this point one",
    "introduces the projection operator @xmath4 which separates the singular part @xmath5 from the non - singular rest @xmath6 , leading to the rearrangement @xmath7 where the reorganized kernel and the hard process , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are to be calculated up to a requested accuracy : lo , nlo , etc .",
    "the dot @xmath10 denotes four - dimensional integration , whereas the @xmath11 is a one - dimensional integral ( convolution ) over the longitudinal momentum ( lightcone ) variable @xmath12 .",
    "the transverse momentum degrees of freedom are integrated out .    why is the above scheme not good for precision mc simulation ?",
    "the three main reasons are : ( 1 ) it does not conserve four momenta . in order to reduce @xmath13 into @xmath11 , the @xmath4 operator allows for unphysical configurations of momenta .",
    "( 2 ) there are very strong over - subtractions ( cancellations ) present .",
    "eq.([eqm ] ) is a geometrical series whereas we expect the final result to be of the exponential form .",
    "( 3 ) the scheme is defined in dimensional regularization ( pole - part extraction ) , whereas the mc simulation must be done in four dimensions .",
    "how can one cure these drawbacks ? ( 1 ) the projection operator @xmath4 has to be redefined .",
    "( 2 ) the time - ordered exponential must follow directly from the construction of the modified factorization expression ( [ eqm ] ) .",
    "( 3 ) the geometrical regularization has to be introduced for the real emissions instead of the dimensional one .",
    "we define a new @xmath14 operator and also introduce a finite - part operator @xmath15 . to the lowest order we have",
    "@xmath16   = k_0 - { \\overleftarrow{{\\mathbbm{p}}}}'_\\mu\\ { k_0 \\}$ ] , as expected . in higher orders @xmath17",

    "having established the general factorization framework , we now turn to the lo mc . it is the basis of the project .",
    "all the nlo effects will be added on top of it by means of the rejection techniques .",
    "the strategy is standard ",
    "one combines twice the formula ( [ ddd ] ) ( a drell  yan case ) : @xmath34\\big\\}_{t.o . } \\label{lolo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and parametrizes it in terms of the sudakov variables ( @xmath35 for emitted partons and @xmath36 for virtual ,  ladder \" , ones ) that can be directly generated .",
    "there are two technical problems to be resolved : ( 1 ) the constraint on the value of the final @xmath37 ( necessary for resonant processes ) and ( 2 ) complete coverage of the phase space without any gaps .",
    "the standard solution of the problem ( 1 ) is the  backward evolution \" @xcite , which uses a pretabulated grid of pdfs . in order to avoid this complication we proposed a different algorithm which imposes the constraint on top of the normal  forward \" evolution ,",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "the problem ( 2 ) is solved by a kinematical mapping of the original phase space to the  tangent space \" ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the mapping we proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite is a plain rescaling , although defined in a recursive way : @xmath39",
    "the rescaling factors @xmath40 are chosen such that @xmath41 this mapping has three important features : ( 1 ) it preserves angles , i.e.  rapidity ordering , and the upper limit of the phase - space ( integration ) in rapidity ; ( 2 ) it preserves soft factors ( @xmath42 ) , i.e.  the original behavior in the soft limit ; ( 3 ) it covers the phase - space completely , without any gaps .",

    "having described the  underlying \" lo mc , we proceed now with the nlo corrections .",
