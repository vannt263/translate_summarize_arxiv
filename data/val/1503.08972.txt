    "one of the fascinating problems in condensed matter physics is the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) .",
    "especially , the mit driven by electron correlations has attracted a lot of attention .",
    "the electron correlations suspend the double occupancy of electrons , and the suspension causes the electron localization  @xcite . with the achievements of ultracold atom techniques , optical lattices can experimentally simulate various theoretical models of electron correlations  @xcite .",
    "they have been providing a novel stage for studying correlation effects in materials . in particular",
    ", the mott insulator was observed in optical lattices of fermionic @xmath0k atoms with two hyperfine states and repulsive interaction between them  @xcite .",
    "these optical lattices really simulate the two - component hubbard model and they provide a connection between experimental observations and theoretical predictions .",
    "the optical lattices can also be established with different particle species which can be extended to have both large hyperfine multiplets and mass imbalances .",
    "for example , a mixture of single - spin state @xmath0k immersed in two - component fermionic atoms @xmath1li or a mixture of two - component state @xmath2yb and six - component state @xmath3yb have already been achieved  @xcite .",
    "such achievements provide possible realizations of the mit in multi - component correlation systems .",
    "theoretical studies already predicted a mit in three - component hubbard models  @xcite .",
    "the mit occurs at commensurate particle densities when the local interaction is isotropic  @xcite . with an anisotropy of the local interactions ,",
    "the mit is also found at incommensurate half filling  @xcite .",
    "however , in these studies , all component particles have the same mass .",
    "experiments can also separately tune the individual effective mass of each particle species and establish imbalanced mass mixtures .",
    "indeed , in a mixture of @xmath1li and @xmath0k atoms , the mass imbalance can be tuned in a wide range  @xcite .",
    "the mixtures of two - component particles with different masses in the optical lattice generally lead to the difference between the hopping amplitudes associated with each component . with deviation from the balance limitation",
    ", some phase transitions might happen and change the ground state .",
    "low - temperature properties of the optical lattice in the influence of the imbalance therefore are important and need to be considered .",
    "indeed , mass imbalance in the two - component hubbard model has been studied in detail in the one - dimensional and three dimensional cases that clarified the competing of some order states such as superfluid , charge- , and spin - ordered states in the optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "increasing the hopping imbalance or increasing difference between the bandwidth of each particle species might lead the systems to a situation that one species is transformed from the metallic to the insulating state due to electron - electron correlations while the other still remains in its metallic or insulating state .",
    "the transition is similar to the orbital - selective mit in correlated multiorbital systems  @xcite .",
    "however , in ultracold multicomponent mixtures the mit may deal with odd numbers of components , whereas in multiorbital systems it is impossible  @xcite .",
    "therefore , studying the effects of massimbalance on the mit therefore is an interesting subject of the optical lattice systems .",
    "actually , the effects of the mass imbalance on the mit in fermion mixtures of two single - component particle species have been studied  @xcite .",
    "the two species show distinct properties , which deviate from the behaviors of balanced mass mixtures  @xcite . in fermion - fermion mixtures of multicomponent particle species with extreme mass imbalance , where one particle species is extremely heavy and immobile , distinct mits",
    "were also found  @xcite .",
    "the mit can occur at both commensurate and incommensurate particle densities . despite that one species",
    "is always localized , the mit can be classified as a collective , species - selective or inverse transition , depending on the local interaction and particle densities  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the effects of the mass imbalance on the mit in multicomponent fermion - fermion mixtures .",
    "the mixtures consist of two - component and single - component fermion particles .",
    "in contrast to the previous study  @xcite , both particle species have finite masses and mobilities .",
    "such fermion - fermion mixtures can be realized by @xmath0k with @xmath1li atoms , or light @xmath1li or @xmath0k with heavy fermionic isotopes of sr or yb .",
    "to model these mixtures with a mass imbalance we propose a three - component hubbard model with different hopping amplitudes .",
    "actually , the hopping amplitudes can experimentally be tuned by the lattice potential and the recoil energy  @xcite . in the balanced mass mixtures ,",
    "the local interaction can drive the mixtures from metal to insulator states at commensurate particle densities  @xcite . in the extreme case , where one species is completely localized or nonhopping , the hubbard model above reduces to a three - component falicov - kimball model and the mit",
    "is found existing in both states of commensurate and incommensurate particle densities  @xcite .",
    "studying the mit in between , i.e. , with the hopping imbalance in the systems , therefore seems to be important to release the low - temperature quantum properties under the competition between the complex of electronic kinetic energy and the strong correlations .",
    "we study the three - component hubbard model by employing dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) with exact diagonalization ( ed ) .",
    "the dmft has been used successfully to study the strongly correlated electron systems  @xcite .",
    "the previous studies of mit in the three - component hubbard and falicov - kimball models were also based on the dmft  @xcite .",
    "the dmft is exact in infinite dimensions and fully captures local dynamical fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "however , it loses nonlocal correlations in finite dimensions . within the dmft",
    ", we found a mit that is solely driven by the mass imbalance .",
    "this transition is a species - selective - like transition of lighter particles and occurs only at commensurate total particle densities and moderate local interactions . for weak and strong correlations , the mass imbalance can not drive the mixture out of its state .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the three - component hubbard model with a mass imbalance . in this section we also present the application of the dmft to the proposed hubbard model .",

    "this case can be interpreted as a fermion - fermion mixture of two different particle species .",

    ", @xmath28 can vary from @xmath34 to @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "one may expect to detect the mass - imbalance driven mit in such ultracold atom mixtures at commensurate particle densities and moderate local interactions .",
    "we have studied the mit driven by the mass imbalance in the three - component hubbard model . within the dmft with exact diagonalization , we have found the mit driven by the mass imbalance at commensurate total densities , like in the balanced three - component hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "the mit is solely driven by the mass imbalance .",
    "the positive mass imbalance can only drive the mixture from insulator to metal , while the negative one drives the mixture from metal to insulator . in order to explore the mit in the three - component hubbard model with mass imbalance ,",
    "we have also calculated the double occupancies of both two - component particles ( @xmath77 ) and different species particles ( @xmath95 ) as functions of @xmath28 and local interaction @xmath12 . at a critical @xmath12 value , the double occupancies exhibit a kink , indicating the mit transition of the first order .",
    "the more enhancing the mass imbalance , the mit takes place at larger critical @xmath12 value . the phase diagram expressing the mit in the ( @xmath28 , @xmath12 )",
    "plane is also constructed .",
    "it shows that the mit occurs only at moderate local interactions . for weak and strong local interactions",
    ", the mass imbalance can not drive the system out of its ground state .",
    "actually , the mass imbalance induces a population imbalance between particle species , and the lighter particles dominantly take part in the mit .",
    "the mit can be interpreted as a light - particle species selective transition .",
    "these features are distinct from the behaviors of balanced systems .",
    "we predict the mit driven by the mass imbalance in fermion - fermion mixtures of ultracold atoms , loading into optical latices , for instance , the mixture of @xmath0k and @xmath101li atoms . by measuring the ratio of the doubly occupied sites in the optical lattices ,",
    "the mit could be observed by tuning the mass imbalance ratio .",
