    "the mathematical model of quantum computation has appeared in the 1980-th with the works of david deutsch [ 1 ] and others [ 2 - 4 ] . in 1994",
    "peter shor [ 5 ] proposed an effective quantum algorithm for solving the npi - candidate task  factorisation of big composite numbers .",
    "this breakthrough allowed to expect , that any task from np could have an effective solution on a quantum computer .",
    "this hope was weakened after the lov grover s work [ 6 ] in 1996 , which proposed the general quantum algorithm for solving any task from np .",
    "the algorithm was designed to search the particular point in the unsorted database of size n with only @xmath0 oracle queries .",
    "grover has shown that under the considered assumptions the algorithm is optimal , so only quadratic speedup can be achived by the quantum computer compared to the classical one , if we do nt have additional information about the oracle functioning .",
    "this paper describes the improvement of the quantum database search algorithm , exhibiting the exponential speedup over the classical search , by changing some preliminary assumptions about the model of computation .",
    "the reasoning goes as follows . in section 2",
    "we recall the grover s database search algorithm .",
    "section 3 describes the new quantum computation model with von neumann architecture applied , and the new algorithm for the unsorted database search is proposed along with its complexity estimation .",
    "section 4 glues everything together thus serving as a conclusion .",
    "first , let us recall the algorithm proposed by lov grover . let s consider the function f :    @xmath1 @xmath2    which is some decision function over the set of n - bit strings .",
    "@xmath3  is the number of all possible n - bit strings , thus the number of all possible inputs to f. function f is implemented as a black box .",
    "our purpose is to find the n - bit string @xmath4 on which f returns 1 .",
    "grover defines the quantum oracle @xmath5 :    @xmath6    where x is n - bit string , and y is one bit .",
    "on the first n qubits @xmath5 acts as follows :    @xmath7    @xmath5 acts identically on any vector orthogonal to @xmath8 , while changes the sign of @xmath8 itself , thus it can be considered as the reflection of any vector over the hyperplane orthogonal to @xmath8",
    ".    then the vector @xmath9 and operator @xmath10 are introduced as follows :    @xmath11 @xmath12    where h is n - qubit hadamard transform .",
    "operator @xmath10 reflects any vector over the vector @xmath9 .",
    "the grover iteration is    @xmath13    the @xmath14 operator rotates the initial vector @xmath9 towards the desired vector @xmath8 by the angle @xmath15 , where @xmath16 .",
    "the action of the first two grover iterations is shown on the figures [ grov_1 ] and [ grov_2 ] .",
    "[ grov_1 ]     [ grov_2 ]",
    "the von neumann architecture was introduced by john von neumann [ 7 ] in 1945 .",
    "one of its most famous concepts is the idea of representing algorithms as a special type of data , which can be stored in computer memory along with the information they process .",
    "the computer hardware may then become universal and not depending on the solved tasks .",
    "this idea is considered to be very common and natural for the classical computing model .",
    "however , the quantum computing model still distinguish data ( quantum system state ) from a program ( sequence of unitary transforms in the system state space ) .",
    "some of these unitary tranforms have the natural mapping on the system states .",
    "for example , the state @xmath9 defines the transform @xmath17 in the previous section .",
    "if we assume , that the state of one quantum system can be used as a reflection tranform in another quantum system , then we can introduce a much simplier and effective algorithm for the unsorted database search .    following grover",
    ", we will denote :    @xmath18 @xmath6 @xmath19    we still consider the case of searching of the special input @xmath4 among all n - bit strings .",
    "the number of grover s iterations needed to get the result with high probability after measurement is estimated by @xmath20 .",
    "for example , if n equals to 8 ( each input is one byte ) , then the number of grover s iterations must be close to 12 .",
    "let s suppose that we already have performed a half of these 12 iterations in one system , while in another system we ve prepared the initial state @xmath9 ( figure [ new_alg_1 ] ) .",
    "[ new_alg_1 ]   with 6 grover s iterations.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]    if the vector @xmath21 can be used as the operator @xmath22 in the left system with the initial state @xmath9 , then we need only one iteration to get close to @xmath4 instead of the remained 6 grover s iterations ( figure [ new_alg_2 ] ) .",
    "[ new_alg_2 ]   applied.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]    again , the vector @xmath21 itself can be constructed from the vector @xmath23 with the same process , thus omitting 3 grover s iterations ( figure [ new_alg_3 ] ) . continuously applying this trick we can reduce the number of all grover s iterations to @xmath24 .",
    "each such reflection divides the number of nesessary grover s iterations by 2 .",
    "[ new_alg_3 ]   applied.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]    this means that for solving the unsorted database search problem we need to :    1 .",
    "perform one grover s iteration to get vector @xmath25 .",
    "2 .   prepare the state @xmath9 on another system .",
    "apply the vector from the first system as a reflection to the second system .",
    "4 .   repeat @xmath26 times the steps 2 - 3 .",
    "the implementation of @xmath27 operator , which depends on some quantum state @xmath28 and acts on another quantum system is an open question in the scope of this work .",
    "the proposed quantum algorithm allows us to solve the unsorted database search problem exponentialy faster than that described by grover .",
    "however , the assumption of possibility of applying states as operators to other systems does nt correspond to the classical quantum computation model , developed to these days .",
    "note that with the new algorithm we need only one call to the @xmath5 oracle to get the direction .",
    "after that all the remained iterations do not call the oracle directly . to implement the new algorithm",
    "we need only two quantum systems , which will change their roles on each iteration . the `` algorithm '' system ( which is used as an operator ) on the next iteration must prepare the initial state @xmath9 and become a `` data '' system and vice versa .",
