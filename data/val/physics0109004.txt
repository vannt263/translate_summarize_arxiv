    "diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) methods provide a powerful theoretical approach to the study of weakly bound clusters of atoms and molecules . the favorable polynomial",
    "scaling of dmc enables clusters with large numbers of degrees of freedom to be studied , provided that suitable schemes for sampling the multi - dimensional wavefunctions exist . in the case of van der waals clusters containing one or more molecules , there often",
    "exist several different time scales , deriving on the one hand from the monomer internal degrees of freedom , and on the other hand from the ` external ' monomer translations and rotations which are associated with the van der waals modes between monomers .",
    "typically , there is a large time scale separation between the high frequency internal vibrations of the monomer constituents , and lower frequency intermonomer van der waals modes .",
    "this time scale separation is often invoked to motivate approximations in which one effectively freezes the high frequency degrees of freedom when studying the role of the low frequency modes . when applied to intramolecular degrees of freedom using diffusion monte carlo",
    ", this approximation leads to an algorithm first proposed by buch  @xcite , commonly referred to as ` rigid body diffusion monte carlo ' ( rbdmc ) , in which all monomers are treated as non - vibrating , rigid molecules which are free to rotate and translate in the presence of intermolecular interactions .",
    "the first implementation of rbdmc for molecular clusters by buch employed a short - time green s function for the free rotation of each molecular monomer in its instantaneous principal axis frame@xcite .",
    "a convenient gaussian short - time approximation for such monomer rotational motion was assumed in that work .",
    "a number of applications of rbdmc have since been carried out , all of which use a combination of this angular sampling for monomer rotation in local monomer principal axis frames , together with the conventional sampling of translational motions of monomers in the laboratory frame@xcite .",
    "the rigid body rotations are carried out using either euler angles , or quaternion algebra  @xcite .",
    "considerable use has been made of this algorithm for water clusters , where the floppy intermolecular degrees of freedom are difficult to study with other methods for clusters larger than the water dimer  @xcite .",
    "nearly all of the rbdmc applications to date employ dmc in its simplest form , namely unbiased monte carlo sampling in which the ground state wavefunction is sampled directly without using any trial function .",
    "exceptions to this include a calculation for hf - ar@xmath0 for which importance sampling of translational degrees of freedom was implemented@xcite , and a calculation for rotational excitations in clusters of sf@xmath1he@xmath0@xcite .",
    "the latter calculation represents the first application of the complete importance sampling algorithm for rotations and translations which is described in detail in this work .",
    "such biased sampling proves useful since unbiased sampling , while adequate for ground states of relatively strongly bound or fairly rigid clusters , rapidly becomes less efficient for weakly bound systems .",
    "importance sampling also allows for easier computation of quantities other than the energy ( e.g. structural quantities ) that would require descendant weighting@xcite in unbiased dmc .",
    "furthermore , it is also more amenable to study of excited states than are unbiased sampling techniques .",
    "biased sampling in dmc is generally achieved with the importance sampling approach first proposed by kalos and co - workers for translational motions  @xcite .",
    "the improved efficiency is dramatic for very weakly bound systems such as the clusters of helium and hydrogen , which are dominated by quantum effects .",
    "both pure helium clusters@xcite and doped helium clusters@xcite have been studied with this approach .",
    "excited states can be obtained from fixed node calculations in which there is no explicit trial function but where nodal constraints are nevertheless imposed directly in an otherwise unbiased sampling procedure@xcite .",
    "more efficient sampling of excited states within fixed node is often possible by using explicit trial functional forms .",
    "exploration of nodal release , nodal optimization , spectral evolution and other approaches to go beyond the fixed node approximation is an active area of research@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we first outline the standard rigid body diffusion monte carlo algorithm with unbiased sampling ( section [ unbiased ] ) .",
    "our treatment includes a quantum mechanical derivation of the short - time green s function for free rotation of a general asymmetric top ( section [ unbiased_theory ] ) . for spherical tops , formal solutions for both the imaginary time",
    ", diffusive green s function@xcite and the real time green s function@xcite were established a long time ago .",
    "however for a general rigid body , _",
    "i.e. _ , an asymmetric top , formal solutions have been restricted to eigenfunction expansions @xcite , and no rigorous derivation of the expected gaussian form for small angle diffusion has been presented .",
    "a formal solution for this is useful since it enables extension for rotation in the presence of external force fields ( to which the quantum forces in biased diffusion monte carlo are formally equivalent ) to be naturally and rigorously implemented . in section [ unbiased_timestep ]",
    "we show how the use of a rigid body diffusion monte carlo algorithm is motivated , with a detailed discussion of the factors influencing time step choice in a weakly bound system composed of both atoms and molecules . in section [ importance ]",
    "we then extend the rotational green s function formalism to enable direct importance sampling of rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "implementation of the full importance sampled rbdmc algorithm is described in section [ implement ] . in section [ applications ]",
    "we provide some basic applications of this approach which illustrate its use .",
    "first , we demonstrate explicitly with detailed tests that such short - time sampling of the angular degrees of freedom will cover the entire angular configuration space of a rigid body ( section [ 1d3d ] )",

    "the time step parameter used during the monte carlo simulation is determined by two factors .",
    "first , as pointed out by suhm and watts @xcite , when all other factors are equal , the time step is controlled by the smallest mass . indeed , for light particles , the diffusion coefficient is large and the time step has to be small enough so that the particle does not move too far in a single step . but this is not the only factor .",
    "the effect of the potential can also be important .",
    "for example , strongly bound particles must be sampled with a smaller displacement , and hence with a smaller time step , to avoid the majority of monte carlo configurational moves ending in destruction of the configuration . in the general case of a mixture of light and heavy particles",
    ", the time step has therefore to be chosen not only according to the smallest mass value , but also taking the effect of the potential into account .",
    "the presence of heavy , strongly bound particles may require the use of a shorter time step .",
    "for example , in the case of the water dimer , gregory and clary @xcite use time steps of 0.5 - 5.0 au for the all - atom calculations .",
    "those small values are needed because of the presence of high frequency internal modes of the monomers . when using rbdmc , they were able to increase the time step up to 30 - 60 au , because the introduction of the rigid body approximation eliminated these strongly confined degrees of freedom .",
    "this decrease in computational time step is generally cited as the primary motivation for an rbdmc calculation .",
    "the situation with regard to time steps is somewhat more complicated for helium clusters , where a wide range of time scales is operative . for pure helium clusters ,",
    "the time steps used vary typically from 1000 to 10000 au @xcite .",
    "introduction of a non - rotating , rigid sf@xmath1 impurity requires a time step reduction to 250 - 500 au @xcite even though the mass of sf@xmath1 is much bigger than that of he .",
    "this reduction of time step is due to the fact that the helium - sf@xmath1 interaction potential is considerably stronger than the he - he potential : the larger time step will lead to inefficient sampling of the he - sf@xmath1 relative motion .",
    "when the molecular rotation is included , the situation becomes quite complicated as one now has the additional intrinsic time scale of the molecular rotation .",
    "thus one needs to compare the corresponding diffusion coefficients @xmath105 and @xmath106 for each species @xmath50 included in the simulation , and to assess both the relative roles of the masses / moments of inertia ( measured via @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) , _ and _ the confining role of the interactions in all degrees of freedom . for the systems studied in this paper , namely sf@xmath1 and hcn in clusters of @xmath2he , the defining parameters are given in table [ table_d ] .",

    "experiments in doped helium clusters show that the rotational spectrum of small molecules inside clusters of @xmath2he possesses the same symmetry as the corresponding spectra in the gas phase , but that the effective rotational constants are reduced  @xcite . for hcn",
    "this reduction is about 20%,@xcite considerably less than the  @xmath115 80% reduction seen for the more strongly bound species such as sf@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "table [ table_d ] shows that hcn is much more weakly bound to helium than sf@xmath1 , but that in both cases the ground state energy of the @xmath116 complex lies above the saddle point of the interaction potential .",
    "analysis of such rotationally excited states within a fixed node approximation requires some estimate of the relevant nodal structure .",
    "insight into this can be obtained from level assignments made according to simple models .",
    "the earlier study of sf@xmath1 in @xmath2he@xmath117 from our group calculated rotational levels corresponding to @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the total angular momentum , and @xmath38 the molecular angular momentum  @xcite . for he - hcn",
