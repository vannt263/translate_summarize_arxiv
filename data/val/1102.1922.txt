    "early - type galaxies ( etgs ) , comprising ellipticals and lenticulars ( e / s0s ) , are generally considered `` red and dead '' , with the bulk of their stars homogeneously old , slightly less so at the lower masses and in the field ( e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thomas et al .  2005 ) ) .",
    "this is clearly an oversimplification , however , and residual star formation is still present in at least @xmath3 of local etgs .",
    "this is easily quantified with near - ultraviolet imaging , particularly sensitive to even small amounts of star formation ( e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* yi et al.2005 ) ) , but is also clearly detected through optical absorption lines ( e.g.  ( * ? ? ? * kuntschner et al .  2010 ) ) .    in this paper , we study the properties of the molecular gas in etgs , the fuel for star formation , through the @xmath4co(1 - 0 ) line .",
    "we focus on the complete , volume - limited sample of @xmath1 local etgs from the atlas@xmath0 survey ( @xmath5  mag ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cappellari et al.2011 ) ) , as well as results from its predecessor ( sauron ; ( * ? ? ?",

    "in ( * ? ? ? * young et al .  ( 2011 ) ) , we present a complete co single - dish survey of the atlas@xmath0 sample carried out with the iram 30 m telescope . with a sensitivity of @xmath6  mk @xmath7 per @xmath8  km  s@xmath9 channel ( @xmath10  @xmath11 of molecular hydrogen at the median distance ) , the main result is a surprisingly high detection rate of @xmath2 . equally important",
    ", detections are present throughout the so - called red sequence , formed of objects with presumably low specific star formation rates .",
    "the molecular gas masses span the range @xmath12@xmath13  @xmath11 , and both the detection rate and the molecular - to - stellar mass ratios are independent of luminosity and most structural and dynamical parameters probed .",
    "there is however a clear dependence on the specific stellar angular momentum ( as quantified by the @xmath14 parameter ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* emsellem et al.2007 ) ) , in the sense that slow - rotating galaxies are deficient in molecular gas , and a possible weak dependence on environment for fast - rotating galaxies .    we have strived to obtain follow - up interferometric line - imaging of all co detections , first with bima and pdbi , and now with carma ( alatalo et al .",

    "* regan et al.2001 ) ) reveals that while the co extent is generally smaller in an absolute sense in etgs , the extent distributions are identical once scaled by a characteristic size ( effective radius , scalelength , isophotal diameter , etc ) .",
    "taking full advantage of the three - dimensional nature of the sauron optical integral - field data _ and _ the co synthesis observations , we can compare the kinematics of the stars , ionised gas , and molecular gas ( fig .",

    "the kinematic major axes of the stars and molecular gas are aligned in about @xmath16 of the co - detected galaxies , implying that the molecular gas is consistent with an internal origin ( e.g.stellar mass loss ) in @xmath16 of the cases overall , while it must have an external origin ( e.g.  external accretion , minor merger ) in at least @xmath17 of the cases ( some of the kinematically - aligned gas can also have an external origin ) .",
    "crucially , these statistics are strongly dependent on environment .",
    "the stars and molecular gas are nearly always kinematically - aligned in clusters ( here virgo ) , while about half the galaxies are misaligned in the field .",
    "this implies that external accretion of gas is very important in the field but is possibly totally shut down in clusters .",
    "interestingly , the ionised and molecular gas are always kinematically - aligned , so that they must share a common origin . as our ionised gas detection rate is much higher ,",

    "comparing our molecular gas maps with the sauron data in a spatially - resolved way , the molecular gas appears to be forming young central disks in a number of objects ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* crocker et al.2011 ) ) .",
    "this is revealed by fast - rotating decoupled central stellar components , depressed stellar velocity dispersions , ionised gas emission with [ oiii]/h@xmath18 line ratios typical of star formation , enhanced h@xmath18 absorption , etc .",
    "however , this is not always the case .",
    "molecular gas is sometimes associated with [ o iii]/h@xmath18 line ratios more typical of those expected from evolved stellar populations , and occasionally no sign of a young stellar population is detected at all .",
    "as etgs are also ( on average ) significantly different dynamically from disk galaxies ( e.g.  @xmath19 parameter ) , it is clear that they represent a different and unique environment in which to probe star formation , both its usual tracers and possible causal relations .",
    "after carefully accounting for internal extinction , we find that the kennicutt - schmidt relation and a constant star formation efficiency ( relating the surface density of molecular gas to that of star formation ) are both consistent with the data . however , the far infrared ( fir)-radio continuum correlation is not satisfied , with too many fir - bright galaxies ( fig .",

    "we have thus started a programme to constrain the opacity , column density , volume density , temperature , and other parameters of the cold gas in our sample galaxies , using multiple molecular line tracers ( e.g.  @xmath20co , hcn , hco@xmath21 ) .",

    "it will also allow to probe trends as a function of both lookback time and environment .",
