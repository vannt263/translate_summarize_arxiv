    "the first experimental manifestation of the quantized hall effect came in transport measurements@xcite : a precisely defined fractional hall conductance @xmath0 and a vanishing longitudinal conductance @xmath1 .",
    "these transport properties can be explained by looking at the spectrum of an isolated quantum hall state .",
    "a gauge invariance argument , proposed by laughlin@xcite and elaborated by halperin@xcite , relates the existence of a gap for current carrying states to the fractionally quantized hall conductance @xmath0 .",
    "it is interesting to parallel the case of quantized hall effects to that of superconductivity , where a transport property , a vanishing resistivity , follows from the existence of an energy gap in the system . in both cases",
    "the study of the isolated system , such as the spectrum and quasiparticle excitations , provides the answers for the features observed via transport measurements .",
    "however , as we know for the case of superconductors , there are interesting physical phenomena which arise not from isolated systems , but from the contact of the system with a normal metal . for example , an electron incident from the normal metal side can either be back - reflected at the interface , or be andreev reflected @xcite as a hole and transfer charge @xmath2 ( a cooper pair @xcite ) to the superconductor .",
    "it is then very natural to ask whether similar effects can also occur in the case of the fqh effect .",
    "more precisely , we should ask what happens in fqh junctions , _",
    "i.e. _ , when we bring a fqh state in contact with either a normal metal ( leads ) or another fqh state with different filling fraction .    some of the properties of these fqh junctions resemble those of normal - metal / superconductor ( n - s ) junctions , even though the underlying physical reasons are quite different . in the case of andreev reflection in n - s junctions , an electron incoming from the n side with an energy falling within the superconducting gap can not go to the s side .",
    "it costs a finite energy to create a quasiparticle excitation in the superconductor , but not to create a cooper pair , so the incoming electron from the n side can be reflected as a hole in the n side , leaving charge @xmath2 on the s side of the junction . here",
    "the superconducting gap plays a fundamental role .",
    "now , in the case of fqh junctions , there is a gap for all excitations in the bulk but there are always gapless excitations at the boundary , the edge states .",
    "thus , the mechanism for reflection processes at the boundary does not depend directly on the gap , but instead on the topological properties of fqh states .",
    "consider , for example , a point - contact junction between a @xmath3 fqh state and either leads or a @xmath4 state .",
    "quasiparticles with fractional charge @xmath5 incoming from the @xmath3 side can not go to the leads or @xmath4 side , for the states on the other side of the junction do not sustain fractionally charged excitations ( one may think of this as an infinite gap for charge @xmath5 excitations in a normal metal or a @xmath4 state ) .",
    "thus , upon reaching the junction , a state with two @xmath3 quasiparticles can ( in addition to simply be back - reflected ) be reflected as one quasihole with charge @xmath6 while transmitting charge @xmath7 to the other side of the junction .    in this paper we will study the different reflection processes taking place at point - contact interfaces between fqh states and normal metals or between two fqh states with different filling fractions .",
    "the tools for the study of this problem have been developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the problem of tunneling between two chiral luttinger liquids with different @xmath8 parameters was treated by mapping the problem to tunneling between luttinger liquids with same @xmath8 , and exploring the weak - strong coupling duality symmetry in the latter problem . in that work",
    "the problem was studied at the level of the boson fields without considering the underlying hilbert space for scattering between solitons representing electrons on one side , and fractionally charged quasiparticles on the other .    in",
    "what follows we will be able to write the quasiparticle operators before scattering in terms of the chiral boson fields describing the edge excitations . whereas for weak coupling the quasiparticle operators can still be written in terms of their original chiral boson fields , for strong coupling the boson fields describing both sides of the junction get mixed , and the mixing is determined by the filling fraction mismatch . using the scattering of quasiparticle operators at the junction",
    "we obtain a _ selection matrix _ @xmath9 which relates _ quantum numbers _ of incoming and outgoing quasiparticle or soliton states .",
    "such one to one correspondence between in and out quantum numbers exists at both weak and strong coupling limits .",
    "we will show that at weak coupling the selection matrix is trivial but at strong coupling it depends on the value of the filling fraction of the fqh system .",
    "although this matrix contains less information than the @xmath10-matrix ( which relates amplitudes ) , it is sufficient to determine transport properties such as the conductance and it allows a classification of the possible processes taking place at the junction .",
    "the selection matrix encodes a set of selection rules which we show can be satisfied if the quantum numbers of the scattering states lie on a 2d lattice . at strong coupling",
    "the lattice can be described by two basis vectors corresponding to two different reflection processes : normal and andreev type reflections .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we describe the model for a fqh - normal metal junction at a point contact . in sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] we analyze the model at both fixed points : weak and strong . in sec .",
    "[ sec : classif ] we classify the allowed scattering processes at the strong coupling fixed point , in sec .  [ sec : kondo ] we present a conjecture that relates the fqh tunnel junction to the two - channel kondo problem , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we review our main results .",
    "details on the proper definition of electron operators and the role of boundary conditions are discussed in the appendix .",
    "we start with a model lagrangian for the fqh - normal metal junction at a point - contact which describes the dynamics on the edge of a fqh liquid , the electron gas reservoirs , and the tunneling between them through a single point - contact of the form @xmath11 the dynamics of the edge of the fqh liquid with a laughlin filling fraction @xmath12 is described by a free chiral boson field @xmath13 with the lagrangian @xcite @xmath14 the edge electron operator is given by @xmath15 while the quasiparticle operator is given by @xmath16    @xmath17 describes the dynamics of the electron gas reservoir . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , a 2d or 3d electron gas can be mapped to a 1d chiral fermi liquid ( fl ) ( @xmath18 ) when the tunneling is through a single point - contact .",
    "this 1d chiral fermi liquid is represented by a free chiral boson field @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is given by @xmath21 in this case , the electron operator is given by @xmath22 in this paper we discuss the problem of tunneling of _ electrons _ from the reservoir , or fermi liquid ( fl ) , to the fqh state and back .",
    "thus , some care has to be taken to keep the correct ( anti)commutation relations of the various fields .",
    "naturally the _ electron operators _ for the fqh state and the fl must anticommute as they create fermion states .",
    "the bosonized formulas for the electron operator for the edge state @xmath23 [ eq .  ( [ eq : psiedge ] ) ] and for the fl [ eq .  ( [ eq : el ] ) ] ,",
    "as they stand , commute with each other .",
    "the conventional way to fix this problem  @xcite is to multiply each operator by a suitable klein factor ( or cocycle ) which ensures the operators have the correct anticommutation properties .",

    "notice , however , that the product of the klein factors @xmath35 commutes with all other terms in the hamiltonian and hence it is a constant of motion and , as such , it can be absorbed in the definition of the tunneling amplitude @xmath33 .",
    "it is also straightforward to show that @xmath35 only changes if the total number of electrons in the combined system , edge plus reservoir , is changed .",
    "thus , from now on , we will drop the klein factors from the full hamiltonian .    by folding each chiral boson into a semi - infinite system",
    ", one can describe the junction as the coupling between two strings with mismatched luttinger parameters or compactification radii , as shown in fig .",

    "the first case is trivial , and corresponds to two decoupled systems .",
    "the second is solvable via a weak - strong duality symmetry , and we identify in this case the andreev like processes at the junction .    since the weak coupling ( @xmath39 ) fixed point is stable , whereas the strong coupling limit ( @xmath40 ) is unstable , an external voltage or a finite temperature sets a natural energy scale in the problem which then separates the weak and strong coupling regimes .",

    "let us remark here that this approach can also be used to describe the more general case of two chiral luttinger liquids with different filling fractions @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",

    "are decoupled from each other . if an electron ( quasiparticle ) is sent from the fermi liquid ( fqh ) side of the junction it is perfectly reflected at the point contact .",
    "thus there is no net current flowing through the junction in any direction , corresponding to a neumann boundary condition at the interaction site . in this case",
    "the fields used originally to describe electrons and quasiparticle excitations describe both the incoming and the outgoing states and the probability amplitude for any scattering process can be calculated in a straightforward fashion . in a generic scattering process @xmath70 incoming electrons and @xmath71 incoming quasiparticles are scattered into @xmath72 and @xmath73 electrons and quasiparticles respectively .",

    "the two - channel kondo problem is a system in which two species of band fermions ( each of them in conventional fermi liquid states ) are coupled , with strength @xmath135 , to a spin-@xmath136 magnetic impurity localized at the origin .",

    "for the two - channel , spin-@xmath136 kondo problem , the entropy is equal to @xmath140 .",
    "moreover , affleck and ludwig have also shown that this is a non - fermi liquid fixed point in the sense that , in this regime , the one - body @xmath86-matrix of the band fermions vanishes at zero frequency .",
    "alternatively stated , the fermion propagator no longer has a pole but a branch cut .",
    "it has also been shown that in the two - channel spin-@xmath136 kondo problem  @xcite an anisotropic exchange coupling between the impurity and the conduction electrons is an irrelevant operator , but a perturbation which induces an explicit channel anisotropy and breaks the degeneracy between the two channels , is a relevant operator .",
    "the rg flows , due to the presence of the channel symmetry breaking perturbation , drive the system away from the non - trivial zero - temperature fixed point , to a strong coupling ( large @xmath135 ) and large anisotropy infrared stable fixed point . at this new fixed point",

    "( [ eq : duallag2 ] ) it was shown that the lagrangian for the fqh tunnel junction is a sum of the lagrangians of two decoupled systems : a free boson ( @xmath141 ) , and a boundary sine - gordon system ( @xmath142 ) with compactification radius @xmath143 . from the work of fendley , saleur and warner @xcite ( fsw )",

    "at the stable fixed point @xmath145 , the ground state entropy vanishes . thus we see that , for the special case of @xmath149 , we get the same entropy and scaling dimensions as in the two - channel , spin-@xmath136 kondo problem .",
    "also , in both problems , fqh / normal metal junctions and two - channel kondo problem , a given perturbation drives the system from a non - fermi liquid fixed point to a fermi liquid fixed point .",
    "it is natural then to conjecture that the flow from @xmath124 to @xmath145 ( or , equivalently , from @xmath150 to @xmath37 ) can be identified with the rg trajectory in the two - channel kondo problem with channel anisotropy , which flows from the fixed point at @xmath139 in the isotropic system to the kondo fixed point at @xmath138 in the extreme anisotropic system .",

    "we have examined the scattering processes at both the weak and strong tunneling fixed points of the junction .",
    "the physics of the strong coupling fixed point turned out to be quite interesting .",
    "we have shown that , at the strong coupling fixed point , there are selection rules that govern the scattering processes .",
    "we have described these selection rules in terms of a selection matrix @xmath81 that relates the incoming and outgoing quantum numbers of the excitations .",
    "we found that all the scattering processes allowed in the strong coupling limit can be viewed as a combination of two fundamental processes : ( a ) normal quasiparticle - electron scattering and ( b ) andreev processes .",
    "in addition to encoding the scattering selection rules , the elements of the matrix @xmath81 give the reflection and transmission coefficients for electrons and quasiparticles at the junction .",
    "in particular we have shown that for andreev processes , which involve several quasiparticles impinging on the junction and resulting on a transmitted electron and a number of reflected quasiholes , there is an enhanced conductance ( transmission ) and a negative reflection coefficient ( on the qh side ) .",

    "notice , however , that the fqh system plays the role of n and the normal metal that of s.    we also find that the constraints imposed by charge conservation at the strong coupling fixed point translate into forbidden processes .",
    "for example , the one body @xmath86 matrix for an incoming and outgoing electron in the normal metal side of the junction vanishes at strong coupling .",
    "we showed that these processes , however , become accessible as one moves away from infinite coupling .",
    "this suggests that the strong coupling fixed point is a non - fermi liquid fixed point .",
    "we then conjecture a possible connection between fqh / normal - metal tunnel junctions and the two - channel spin-@xmath151 kondo problem . in both problems",
    "there is a flow from a non - fermi liquid fixed point with a finite ground state entropy , to a fermi liquid fixed point with a vanishing entropy .",

    "although there is a mathematical similarity between the andreev processes that we discussed in this paper and the processes studied by safi and schulz , they are physically quite distinct since , in the context of the qh junctions , andreev reflection is a consequence of the nature of the qh edge states , which have physically strong _ repulsive _ electron - electron interactions . also , we would like to point out that in the framework that we present",

    "( [ eq : rotation ] ) , which maps the original fields @xmath13 and @xmath19 with different compactification radii to a set of new fields @xmath54 and @xmath55 with the same compactification radii",
    ". we will discuss in some detail the consistency of this rotation with the boundary conditions , imposed by the nature of the fqh state .",
    "here we follow the approach first introduced by x.  g.  wen  @xcite and discussed in considerable detail in the review of ref .",
    "@xcite .    the bosonic fields @xmath100 describe the fluctuations of the edges of a given fqh state .",
    "the bulk - edge correspondence  @xcite implies that , for a laughlin fqh state with filling fraction @xmath114 , the operators @xmath183 and @xmath184 ( up to klein factors ) are the operators that create electrons ( with charge @xmath185 and fermi statistics ) and qh quasiparticles ( of charge @xmath114 and fractional statistics @xmath186 ) .",
    "hence , the free boson lagrangian and the electron and quasiparticle operators , are _ invariant _ under the translation @xmath187 , where @xmath71 is an integer .",
    "the invariance of the states under these translations has to be regarded as a symmetry of the system .",
    "notice that this does not imply that these are the only charged states that can exist at the edge .",
    "in fact , since the edge has a gapless spectrum , it is possible to construct _ local _ states with _ any _ charge .",
    "however , these states are not globally defined since only whole _ electrons _ can be added or removed from the bulk fqh fluid . quasiparticles with fractional charge",
    "can also be created on the edges but at the expense of creating quasiholes in the bulk in order to maintain charge neutrality ; _ i.e. _ by insertion of a quantum of flux in the bulk  @xcite .",
    "these facts are reflected in the theory of the edge states through the boundary condition discussed below .",
    "thus , we will regard states that differ by shifts of @xmath188 , with @xmath189 as being physically identical to each other .",
    "in other words , the theory has been  compactified \" , giving @xmath190 the character of an angular variable .",
    "this property dictates what are the appropriate boundary conditions for the field @xmath190 . for an isolated fqh system , which is a droplet of perimeter @xmath191 ,",
    "the field @xmath190 obeys periodic boundary conditions , @xmath192 however , if the amount of charge in the bulk changes , ( _ i .",

    "( [ eq : defr ] ) is consistent with the definition of the electron and quasiparticles operators ( vertex operators ) .",
    "it is worth to remark that the definition of the compactification radius can also be interpreted as the condition for single - valuedness of the electron operator defined on the edges for the closed system . to see this",
    "let us consider the change of the electron operator when taken around the droplet of circumference @xmath191 : @xmath195 however the quasiparticle operator acquires an statistical phase : @xmath196 that is consistent with charge neutrality . as we mentioned above , in order to have a quasiparticle in the edge of the droplet , a quasihole must exist in the bulk .",
    "when the quasiparticle is taken around the droplet it picks up an aharonov - bhom phase due to the presence of the flux creating the quasihole in the bulk .",
    "the winding number is related to the total charge of the edge as follows .",

    "there is a net charge transfer from one system to the other but the total charge is conserved , therefore we must have the condition @xmath206 since @xmath207 , because the smallest amount of charge leaving the fermi liquid side corresponds to one electron , we have @xmath208 .    as we pointed out , the rotation defined in eq .",
