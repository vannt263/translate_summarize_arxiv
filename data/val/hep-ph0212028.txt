    "grand unification ideas @xcite offer an attractive theoretical framework for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "phenomenologically , unification helps to explain the gauge quantum number assignments of the sm , while correlating the observed gauge couplings .",
    "it also seems significant for ultimate gauge - gravity unification that the high unification scale is not too far from the planck scale .",
    "this also helps to suppress baryon decay .",
    "as is well known , unification has achieved its most striking success within the scenario of weak scale supersymmetry ( susy ) ( for a review , see reference @xcite ) .",
    "susy protects the electroweak scale from radiative corrections at the unification and planck scales , while supplying just the right complement of superpartners to give a fairly precise meeting of gauge couplings as they are run up in energy .",
    "only believably small threshold corrections need to be invoked . in this paper , we will study unification in quite a different , _",
    "non_-supersymmetric , approach to the hierarchy problem , namely the randall - sundrum ( rs1 ) extra - dimensional scenario @xcite . here",
    ", the hierarchy problem is solved by having a highly warped compactification with the metric : @xmath3 a slice of ads@xmath4 with radius of curvature @xmath5 .",
    "the extra dimension is an orbifolded circle of `` radius '' @xmath6 . in the rs1 set - up",
    ", the relationship between @xmath7 mass scales ( which are all taken to be of order the @xmath1 planck scale , @xmath8 ) and those in an effective @xmath1 description depends on the location in the extra dimension : @xmath9 thus , the higgs sector is localized at the `` ir brane '' ( @xmath10 ) , where it is protected by a low warped - down fundamental scale of order a tev for a modestly large radius , while @xmath1 gravity is localized near the `` planck brane '' ( @xmath11 ) and has a planckian fundamental scale @xcite . if the sm ( gauge ) fields are on the ir brane as in the original rs1 model @xcite , then the effective uv cut - off for the sm is @xmath12 tev and hence unification of gauge couplings at planckian scales can not be addressed in the effective field theory .",
    "if the sm gauge fields are in the bulk ( first suggested in reference @xcite and studied in references @xcite ) , then quantum loops are sensitive to greatly varying , in particular , planckian scales since the loops span the extra dimension .",
    "hence high scale unification can be studied .",
    "we will give realistic models based on having unified @xmath13 gauge fields and sm fermions propagating in the extra - dimensional `` bulk '' .",
    "our models display several attractive features :",
    "( i ) they help to explain the observed gauge quantum numbers of quarks and leptons by greatly restricting the possibilities .",
    "( ii ) they correlate the observed gauge couplings by a mechanism of logarithmic gauge coupling unification .",
    "the quantitative success is very similar to that of the familiar sm , the _",
    "calculable _ one - loop contributions to gauge couplings giving unification to within @xmath14 .",
    "but unlike the sm , there is a natural source of small , but volume - enhanced bulk threshold corrections needed to fit the observed couplings .",
    "( iii ) the fact that the unification scale is not far from the planck scale is not an accident , but follows from the rs1 approach to solving the hierarchy problem .",
    "( iv ) there is a natural solution to the problem of baryon - number violation which puts our models on a very similar footing to the sm .",
    "( v ) it is a remarkable feature of the rs1 mechanism that it has a purely @xmath1 dual description , given by the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , in which the higgs is a tev scale composite of a strongly coupled large-@xmath15 conformal field theory .",
    "all of the above features of unification have simple @xmath1 interpretations which clarify their more general applicability for theories of strongly interacting higgs sectors .",
    "yukawa coupling unification is not studied in this paper .    beyond its intrinsic interest , we believe that the study of non - supersymmetric unification in the rs1 scenario is of value in coming to a more balanced view of weak scale susy . the attractions of supersymmetric grand unified theories ( guts ) and the absence so far of definitive experimental confirmation poses tough questions for particle physicists . how strong a hint is the seamless fit of unification into weak scale susy that these ideas are actually realized in nature ?",
    "now _ qualitatively _ , rs unification shares many of the features of supersymmetric unification .",
    "_ quantitatively _ , rs unification is attractive but does not match the precision of supersymmetric unification , where the _ calculable _ contribution to running of gauge couplings gives unification to within @xmath16 compared to @xmath14 for the sm and our rs1 scenario . in both supersymmetric guts and rs gut ,",
    "the small discrepancies in unification can _ naturally _ be attributed to uv-_sensitive _ , but parametrically small , threshold corrections .",
    "we see that the phenomenological support for unification is not an all or nothing pointer towards susy .",
    "most of this support is present in the sm , and can be maintained by sensible non - supersymmetric approaches to the hierarchy problem like rs1 .",
    "it is only the _ extra _ precision in the fit of supersymmetric unification that has to be an accident in order for weak scale susy to be false , but much less of an accident than if only susy could combine unification with a solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "there are important distinctions between unification in rs1 and unification in unwarped extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite proposed high - scale unification with gauge fields propagating in tev scale extra dimensions , with some of the gauge symmetry and @xmath17 susy broken by orbifold boundary conditions . the bulk @xmath17 susy protects logarithmic running above the compactification scale . in both this scenario and in the rs model the non - renormalizable higher - dimensional effective field theory must be uv - completed not far above the tev scale . in spite of that ,",
    "in the rs scenario we consider , we are able to controllably study unification at much higher scales within effective field theory . reference @xcite found _ low_-scale unification by studying supersymmetric extra dimensional models .",
    "gauge coupling unification was _ not _ correlated in a simple way with the observed strength of gravity because of the absence of logarithmic running .",
    "reference @xcite studied a toy model of unification in the context of large ( gravity - only ) extra dimensions . within specific superstring theory models ,",
    "unification was achieved by classical logarithmic potential effects which closely resemble effects of @xmath1 logarithmic running , in particular , gauge coupling unification _ was _ correlated with the observed strength of gravity as we will also find . however , whereas in reference @xcite , the fact of unification depends entirely on stringy uv details , in the unification scheme we study , the dominant ingredients are calculable in the effective field theory .",
    "references @xcite studied _ high_-scale unification , but with compactification scales close to the unification scale . in our models , because of warping , the kaluza - klein ( kk ) mass scale is far lower than the unification scale . however",
    ", our mechanism for avoiding excessive proton decay by breaking the gut symmetry with boundary conditions is similar to mechanisms of references @xcite .",
    "several issues of the rs set - up relevant for our paper already appear in the literature .",
    "unification in an rs setting was first studied in a _",
    "supersymmetric _ version in reference @xcite ( and recently in reference @xcite ) ,",
    "susy allowing for a different placement of matter and higgs fields from ours .",
    "reference @xcite pointed out the basic feature of logarithmic `` running '' in rs1 _ above _ the lightest kk mass , on which our work relies .",
    "reference @xcite first proposed _",
    "non_-supersymmetric coupling unification in the rs solution to the hierarchy problem and studied the requisite logarithmic running .",
    "it differs from our work in that it focused more on the case where there is no explicit unified gauge group , in the proposal for baryon number conservation and in the approximations made .",
    "reference @xcite also studied logarithmic running and non - supersymmetric guts ( including the cft dual description ) , but did not discuss quantitative unification and the proton decay problem .",
    "references @xcite further studied gauge coupling renormalization in rs1 , relevant for unification , from various points of view . in particular , we laid the foundations for our approach to differential running of gauge couplings in reference @xcite .    while having sm gauge fields propagate in the rs bulk is good for unification ,",
    "there have been studies pointing out several unattractive phenomenological features @xcite .",
    "in particular these studies suggest that unless the warped down fundamental scale is of order @xmath18 tev or higher , kk gauge bosons would make excessive contributions to electroweak precision and compositeness observables .",
    "such a high fundamental scale would render the higgs and the weak scale somewhat fine - tuned .",
    "actually , we find the phenomenology of the rs1 scenario with bulk gauge fields very intriguing and subtle and believe that the severe constraints found thus far can be considerably weakened by simple model - building .",
    "interesting as it is from both theoretical and experimental points of view , we will not delve into these topics of weak scale constraints and signals here , but will reserve that for a later paper @xcite . for present purposes",
    "the reader can take the warped down fundamental scale to be a few tev , the exact number not being important given the precision in coupling unification we will attain .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows . in section [ review ]",
    "we review the standard unification in the minimal sm and in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , so as to lay the foundation for our study of rs unification . in section [ module ] , we present a minimal module for rs unification , discuss its features and compare it with the more familiar unification scenarios . in section [ matter ] , we discuss sm fermions living in the extra dimensional bulk and give a mechanism that leads to accidental ( but , anomalous ) baryon - number conservation , very similar to that of the ordinary sm . thus , our basic module can be completed into realistic models . in section [ cft ] ,",

    "we can compare the required ( threshold ) correction to the typical size of _ differential _ running contribution which is dominated by gauge boson loops .",
    "their contributions are given by @xmath34 group theory factors .",
    "we see that requiring @xmath35 corresponds to @xmath14 correction to differential running .",
    "let us see if such @xmath36 is reasonable .",
    "there are two types of threshold corrections : loops of particles at @xmath0 which contribute @xmath37 number of particles at @xmath0 ( no large logarithms ) and planck - suppressed operators @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 breaks the gut ) which contribute @xmath40 .",
    "assuming no unnaturally large parameters ( for example , the number of particles at @xmath0 is not too large ) , both corrections are much smaller than the required @xmath36 .",
    "of course , other than this significant problem , the sm does not protect the weak scale from the unification scale .",
    "we will see that in rs unification , there is a natural source for the requisite @xmath36 and protection for large hierarchies .",
    "as is well - known , the fit to perturbative unification in mssm is very good at one - loop and in fact , a _",
    "two_-loop analysis is warranted .",
    "the central ingredient in the success of supersymmetric guts is the addition of the extra higgs(inos ) and gauginos .",
    "the extra _ differential _ running due to these particles provides the @xmath14 contribution ( on top of the sm differential running ) required to achieve unification . when the analogous two - loop treatment of eq .",

    "we begin with a dual @xmath1 cft interpretation of the minimal module of rs guts , i.e. , with no sm matter or higgs doublet and no orbifold breaking of @xmath13 .",

    "( [ 4dgut ] ) . the running due to the cft charged matter between the planck scale ( the uv cut - off ) and the tev scale is _ mostly _ ( assuming @xmath152 is small ) @xmath13 _ symmetric _ and accounts for the ( universal ) @xmath156 / \\hbox{tev}$ ] , i.e. , @xmath83 enhanced terms in @xmath157 , in particular the dominant @xmath158 term .",
    "the @xmath13 _ breaking _ part of the _ running _ due to the cft charged matter ( which also has a planckian logarithm ) is suppressed by @xmath152 and corresponds to the @xmath33 in eq .",

    "the dual interpretation changes when we modify the orbifold boundary conditions of the minimal module so as to break @xmath13 on the tev brane ( i.e. , @xmath55 , @xmath56 vanish on the tev brane ) .",
    "the interpretation now is that @xmath13 is _ spontaneously _ broken by the cft at the tev scale , i.e. , the same scale at which conformal invariance is broken @xcite , on top of the explicit breaking by the cft dynamics ( @xmath159 ) . since ( on the rs side )",
    "the @xmath160 and @xmath161 are @xmath162 ( i.e. , do _ not _ vanish ) on the planck brane , we add fundamental fermions in these representations in the dual cft ( these will be denoted by the same symbols )  thus , the fundamental fermions have the same quantum numbers as in the sm , but are _ twice _ as many . these fermions ( external to the cft ) couple to ( fermionic )",
    "operators of the cft ( which are in conjugate representations ) denoted by @xmath163 , @xmath164 etc .",
    "since ( on the rs side ) the quark @xmath132 singlet from @xmath165 ( denoted by @xmath145 ) is @xmath166 ( i.e. , vanishes on the tev brane ) and hence does not have a zero - mode , in the dual cft , it must be that the @xmath163 operator of the cft interpolates a _ massless _ composite fermion of the cft which marries ( i.e. , gets a dirac mass with ) @xmath145 .",
    "whereas , this cft operator does _ not _ interpolate a massless composite to marry the fundamental @xmath132 doublet lepton from @xmath165 ( denoted by @xmath167 ) .",
    "the fact that massless composite fermions of the cft below tev do _ not _ come in complete @xmath13 multiplets is consistent because @xmath13 is broken ( spontaneously ) by the cft at that scale .",
    "@xmath167 can mix with the cft composites  the resultant massless state corresponds to the sm @xmath132 doublet lepton ( denoted by @xmath168 ) .",
    "the degree of this mixing depends on the anomalous dimension of the fermionic cft operator , @xmath163 which is related on the rs side to the fermion mass parameter @xmath101 .",
    "a similar analysis can be done for the other sm fermions .",
    "the coupling of fundamental fermions to fermionic cft operators is essential to generating yukawa couplings since the higgs doublet is a composite of the cft . in this way",
    ", the rs scenario with bulk fermions realizes the idea proposed in reference @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the fundamental fermions to running of the gauge couplings ( above tev scale ) is universal ( for @xmath63 ) since they are in complete @xmath13 multiplets ( for example , @xmath167 and @xmath145 )  the modification of this running due to mixing of these fermions with cft composites is also universal since @xmath167 and @xmath145 couple to the _ same _ cft operator , @xmath163 and hence the mixing is @xmath13 symmetric .",
    "the @xmath55 , @xmath56 gauge bosons ( either the fundamental ones with a mass of @xmath0 or the bound states of the cft with @xmath55 , @xmath56 quantum numbers and with masses @xmath12 tev ) do _ not _ couple sm fermion @xmath168 to @xmath169 since these fermions ( which are mixtures of fundamental and cft fields ) have their origin in _ different _ @xmath113 fundamental fields .",
    "so , proton decay from exchange of @xmath55 , @xmath56 gauge bosons is absent .",
    "as mentioned earlier , to forbid proton decay from higher - dimensional operators , on the rs side , we introduce a bulk @xmath119 gauge symmetry which is a linear combination of @xmath125 and @xmath170 .",
    "spectators on tev brane cancel all @xmath119 anomalies .",
    "the @xmath126 gauge symmetry is broken by the planckian vev of a sm singlet scalar living on the planck brane .",
    "the dual picture is that the cft and the fundamental fermions coupled to it have an exact @xmath126 symmetry which is gauged by a @xmath1 vector field .",
    "it is _ not _ that the @xmath1 gauging of the @xmath126 symmetry is protecting the theory from excessive proton decay  in fact , in the dual picture , the @xmath1 @xmath126 gauge theory is higgsed near the planck scale and at this scale operators violating @xmath126 and @xmath125 are allowed .",
    "the central point is that all such violations of @xmath125 are strongly irrelevant in the ir of the cft coupled to fundamental fermions and light gauge fields .",
    "gauge symmetry is also spontaneously broken by the higgs vev , but this breaking still preserves baryon - number .",
    "hence higher - dimensional operators , generated by spontaneous breaking of scale invariance at @xmath12 tev and suppressed by that scale ( which are dual to tev brane - localized operators on the rs side ) , will preserve baryon - number even though they might violate @xmath119 _ after _ electroweak symmetry breaking . recall that sm fermions might have an admixture of cft composites so that these operators can give interactions between sm fermions and so we want them to preserve baryon - number . ] in other words , at sub - planckian energies , @xmath125 is an accidental , global symmetry very much as in the sm .",
    "this is the dual of the fact that @xmath125 is unbroken on the rs side throughout the bulk and on the tev brane . in the dual picture , the spectators are composites of the cft and have yukawa couplings to the higgs ( which itself is a cft composite ) which give them electroweak scale masses when the higgs acquires a vev .",
    "it is interesting to see how cancellation of anomalies involving @xmath126 works in the _ uv _ of the dual theory  in the ir , these anomalies cancel between sm fermions and spectators just as on the rs side .",
    "the cft generates two kinds of _ massless _ composite fermions : ( a ) the spectator fermions and ( b ) fermions required to marry ( the fundamental fermions corresponding to ) the @xmath166 states in the @xmath113 s and @xmath114 s ( i.e. , @xmath145 , @xmath171 etc . ) as mentioned above  the sm and @xmath126 quantum numbers of these composites are opposite to those of the states in @xmath113 s and @xmath114 s they marry .",
    "one can check that these composite fermions do _ not _ have sm , ( sm)@xmath172 and sm@xmath128 ^ 2 $ ] anomalies , but _ do _ have a non - zero @xmath127 ^3 $ ] anomaly . by the t hooft anomaly matching condition , the anomalies of the cft _ by itself _ in the _ uv",
    "_ must be the _ same _ as that of its _ massless _ ( fermionic ) composites .",
    "it can be checked that , in the uv , this @xmath127 ^3 $ ] anomaly of the cft is canceled by that of the _ fundamental _",
    "@xmath113 s and @xmath114 s  the latter also do _ not _ have sm , ( sm)@xmath172 and sm@xmath128 ^ 2 $ ] anomalies . thus , the cft _ and _ external @xmath113 s and @xmath114 s together do not have any anomalies in the uv and hence both @xmath13 and @xmath126 can be gauged .",
    "the fact that the higgs doublet is _ not _ part of a complete @xmath13 multiplet again is consistent with the fact that @xmath13 is spontaneously broken by the cft at the tev scale and the higgs doublet is a composite produced _ below _ that scale .",
    "if @xmath13 is broken by an orbifold boundary condition at the planck brane , ( i.e. , the @xmath55 , @xmath56 vanish on the planck brane ) , then the dual interpretation is that _ only _ the sm subgroup of the ( approximate , up to @xmath173 ) @xmath13 global symmetry of the cft is gauged @xcite .",
    "thus , there are _ no _ @xmath55 , @xmath56 gauge bosons with mass @xmath64 ( unlike section [ cftminimal ] ) so that the sm gauge bosons cause differential running below the uv cut - off @xmath174 , rather than @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath175 $ ] in eq .",
    "( [ rsgut1 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath176 , the large logarithms are unchanged .",
    "it is amusing that on the rs side , the gauge theory is @xmath13 , whereas in the dual cft it is the sm gauge group . when conformal invariance is broken at @xmath12 tev , ( global ) @xmath13 is still preserved ( up to , of course , @xmath152 ) . since ( on the rs side ) @xmath145 is @xmath177 ( i.e. , vanishes on the planck brane ) , we add a fundamental @xmath167 ( and _ not _ @xmath145 ) and couple it to ( the @xmath132 doublet part of ) the operator @xmath163 .",
    "similarly , we add @xmath178 and couple it to the ( _ different _ ) operator @xmath179 .",
    "since the _ full _ @xmath13 symmetry is _ not _ gauged , the fundamental fermions ( external to the cft ) do _ not _ have to be in complete @xmath13 multiplets , but they do have to be _ parts _ of @xmath13 multiplets since they have to couple to cft operators which are in ( complete ) @xmath13 multiplets @xcite .",
    "thus , the understanding of quantum numbers of the sm fermions is intact even though we do _ not _ have @xmath13 _ gauge _ invariance in the dual cft theory @xcite .",
    "thus , the set of fundamental fermions is the _ same _ as the set of sm fermions  in fact , up to mixing with the cft composites as before ( due to their coupling to the corresponding operators ) , these _ are _ the sm quarks and leptons ( i.e. , they are dual to the fermion zero - modes of rs side ) . as before , bound states of the cft with @xmath55 ,",
    "@xmath56 quantum numbers can_not _ couple these massless fermions to each other .",
    "if the mixing of fundamental fermions with the cft composites is small ( dual to @xmath116 ) , then the contribution of these fermions to running of gauge couplings is universal since they can be `` assembled '' into complete @xmath13 multiplets ( for example , @xmath167 and @xmath178 ) .",
    "however , this mixing ( or dressing by cft interactions ) can be large ( dual to @xmath180 ) and _ different _ for @xmath167 and @xmath178 since they couple to cft operators , @xmath163 and @xmath179 , with _ different _ anomalous dimensions .",
    "since the contribution to running is affected by this cft dressing , it is not universal in this case , even though ( as in the case of small mixing ) @xmath167 and @xmath178 are equivalent to a complete @xmath13 multiplet . of course , if @xmath163 and @xmath179 have similar anomalous dimensions , then running is again universal .    as in section [ cfttevproton ] ,",
    "baryon - number is an accidental , global symmetry of the cft and fundamental fermions .",
    "this symmetry is gauged , but again the gauge symmetry is broken at planckian scales and offers no protection at low energies .",
    "unlike in section [ cfttevproton ] , spectators are fundamental fields external to the cft which also get planckian masses at the same time as the @xmath126 gauge field .",
    "thus , the protective @xmath125 accidental symmetry is quantum mechanically anomalous .",
    "the anomaly in baryon - number is due to the fundamental fermions , the cft itself does not contribute to the anomaly since it does _ not _ generate any _ massless _ composite fermions . thus , proton decay is suppressed just as in the sm by an accidental global _ anomalous _ @xmath125 symmetry .",
    "finally , the dual interpretation of the higgs triplet on the tev brane is that such a composite of the cft _ is _ expected from the ( approximate ) @xmath13 ( global ) symmetry of the cft sector ( which survives even after conformal invariance is broken at tev ) .",
    "the higgs triplet can_not _ mediate proton decay because of the accidental baryon - number symmetry mentioned above .",
    "another issue concerning the higgs triplet is why it does not acquire a phenomenologically dangerous vev . indeed , if @xmath181 ( i.e. , the cft has _ exact _",
    "@xmath13 global symmetry ) and we consider the cft in isolation , then a vev for the higgs doublet implies a vev for the higgs triplet ( again , both are cft composites ) .",
    "however , due to the small ( @xmath182 ) explicit breaking of the @xmath13 ( global ) symmetry of the cft , the mass of higgs triplet can be different than that of the higgs doublet ( this is the dual of @xmath44 vev splitting the higgs doublet from the triplet ) so that the higgs triplet need not acquire a vev .",
    "also , the cft is _ not _ isolated , but is coupled to @xmath13 non - symmetric fundamental fields .",
    "so , _ loop _ corrections can further split the higgs triplet from the doublet ( just as on the rs side ) .",
    "the simplest way to summarize the connection between unification and the rs solution to the hierarchy problem is to adopt the cft dual viewpoint , in the sense of the ads / cft correspondence . from this viewpoint ,",
    "the rs higher - dimensional effective field theory studied here is a very useful , weakly coupled dual description of a strongly coupled @xmath1 higgs sector , kk excitations being dual to some of the strongly bound composites .",
    "the higgs boson is an infrared composite of this sector , so that the hierarchy problem is solved by compositeness , without susy .",
    "sm gauge bosons and fermions are fundamental fields coupled to the strong higgs sector .",
    "a key to having an extra - dimensional description which is weakly coupled throughout the extra dimension is that the dual @xmath1 description should be strongly coupled throughout the large planck - weak hierarchy .",
    "this is achieved by having the strongly coupled sector be approximately conformal over the large hierarchy .",
    "let us now turn to unification . in @xmath1",
    "supersymmetric guts , mssm two - loop running leads to gauge coupling unification to within @xmath16 . the discrepancy can naturally be ascribed to threshold corrections ( although there is no predictivity at this level , due to free parameters of the gut ) .",
    "only slightly less striking is @xmath1 _",
    "non_-supersymmetric guts , where sm running alone leads to gauge coupling unification to within @xmath14 .",
    "however , this discrepancy is now too big to be naturally ascribed to gut threshold corrections . of course",
    ", we can add new particles below the gut scale which alter the differential running by the small amount needed to achieve unification .",
    "this is what happens when we supersymmetrize the sm in order to solve the hierarchy problem .",
    "but if the new particles we are adding to solve the hierarchy problem are strongly coupled over the hierarchy as in the rs scenario , there is a second attractive possibility for unification .",
    "we can take the particles of the strong sector to come in _ complete _ @xmath13 multiplets but with interactions which are only _ approximately _ @xmath13 symmetric .",
    "the sm subgroup of @xmath13 is however an exact symmetry of the strong sector and is gauged .",
    "thus the strong sector will naturally make small contributions to _ differential _ running because the _ strong _ interactions which _ non - negligibly _ dress contributions to gauge coupling running are _ weakly _ @xmath13-violating .",
    "the small discrepancies in sm unification can be easily ascribed to these small corrections from the strong sector to differential running .",
    "it is interesting that from the dual @xmath1 viewpoint the small corrections are corrections to _ running _ and therefore logarithmically enhanced , while in the @xmath7 rs viewpoint , the small corrections are threshold type corrections which are volume - enhanced . either way these corrections needed for unification are _ not _ calculable without knowing details of the gut and planck scales , which is _ qualitatively",
    "_ similar to the situation in supersymmetric guts .",
    "our central result is that we are able to maintain the sm level of unification in a _",
    "calculable _ way in a theory of a composite higgs and to point out a naturally small source of corrections which `` fix '' sm running with respect to unification .",
    "these are very difficult problems to address within traditional approaches to strongly interacting higgs sectors .    from the dual @xmath1 viewpoint ,",
    "the central object which is unified is the conformal higgs sector , in that it has an approximate global @xmath13 symmetry . in order for fundamental sm fermions to get non - negligible yukawa couplings",
    ", they must couple to fermionic operators of the conformal higgs sector .",
    "since these operators come in @xmath13 multiplets , in order to preserve sm gauge invariance the sm fermions must have gauge quantum numbers which can be embedded in @xmath13 , providing a partial explanation of the quantum numbers we observe .",
    "excessive proton decay is avoided if the higgs sector coupled to fundamental fermions has an accidental baryon number symmetry ( which might be anomalous upon sm gauging , as in the sm ) .",
    "the near meeting of gauge couplings at high energies and the pattern of fermion quantum numbers within the sm provide tantalizing hints of unification .",
    "this is usually taken as evidence in favor of susy where gauge coupling unification is _ quantitatively _ improved while solving the hierarchy problem .",
    "however , we have shown here that there is an attractive option for unification within the rs scenario for solving the hierarchy problem .",
