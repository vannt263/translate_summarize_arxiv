    "understanding entanglement in quantum many - body systems is a powerful way to unveil their properties ( see the reviews  @xcite ) . among all possible ways to quantify non - local correlations in a many - particle system a key role is played by the entanglement entropy  @xcite . for a system characterized by a ( pure state ) density matrix @xmath1 the entanglement entropy is defined  given a partition into two subsystems @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and a corresponding reduced density matrix @xmath4  as the von neumann entropy of @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "the scaling of @xmath7 with the size of the subsystem @xmath2 carries distinct information on the state of the system  @xcite .",
    "the ground state of a short - range hamiltonian obeys an area law ( scaling like the measure of the border of subsystem @xmath2 ) , with important corrections arising when the system approaches a critical point .",
    "excited states , on the other side  in a similar fashion as thermal states ",
    "follow typically a volume law , where the scaling is with the measure of subsystem @xmath2 ( a notable exception are many - body localized states  @xcite ) .    understanding the behaviour of entanglement entropy is also important in the description of the non - equilibrium dynamics of closed quantum many - body systems  @xcite .",
    "numerous examples support this statement .",
    "entanglement entropy was analysed in the adiabatic dynamics of a many - body system passing through a critical point  @xcite . on the opposite case of a rapid change of the coupling parameters",
    " a quantum quench ",
    "calabrese and cardy  @xcite were the first to study the time - dependence of the entropy in a conformal field theory , specializing then to the case of a one - dimensional integrable spin chain .",
    "they found that the entropy increases linearly before saturating to an asymptotic value ( that scales with the volume of the subsystem ) ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the presence of disorder , for a many - body localized state",
    ", the entropy increases logarithmically  @xcite  a behaviour intimately connected to the dephasing mechanism characteristic of this phase . for a disordered ergodic system  on the opposite  the disorder - averaged entanglement entropy increases linearly in time before saturation , and the asymptotic disorder - distribution of the entanglement entropy coincides with the thermal one  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the interest in its own , the study of the entanglement is also of utmost importance in connection with the possibility to numerically study correlated systems by means of classical simulations , as e.g. the density matrix renormalization group  @xcite .",
    "indeed the power of numerical simulations is limited by the amount of entanglement present in the quantum state .",
    "we will analyse the entanglement entropy in another class of non - equilibrium dynamics in which the quantum system is subject to a periodic driving . in recent years",
    "there has been an uprising interest for periodically driven closed quantum systems , with special emphasis on the existence of an asymptotic time - periodic steady state and the conditions under which it shows thermal properties  @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic state of open driven quantum systems has also been studied in refs .",

    "we will focus our attention on closed driven quantum systems . by means of floquet theory  @xcite ,",
    "formal similarities between this case and that of a quantum quench have been discovered ; at the same time , many results first obtained in the case of a quantum quench have been generalized to the periodic driving case .",
    "one example is the relaxation to the floquet diagonal ensemble of periodically driven systems  @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of the entanglement entropy has been analysed as well in periodically driven systems .",
    "the relation between the way entanglement entropy grows in time and the system being many - body localized or ergodic is the same in periodically driven systems and quantum quenches  @xcite .",
    "transitions between regimes with anomalous scaling exponents in the finite - time entanglement entropy of an integrable fermionic system was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors study the entanglement entropy of a free electron chain undergoing a periodic quench , discussing relations to equilibrium lattice models .",
    "they find the entanglement entropy saturating to an asymptotic value proportional to the volume of the subsystem , displaying in general slow oscillations in time . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors describe the periodic driving of the heisenberg model .",
    "they see that the entanglement entropy saturates after a transient to an asymptotic value obeying a volume law .",
    "remarkably , this asymptotic value is the same as the @xmath8-completely mixed density matrix : the periodic driving makes this system thermalize ( due to the absence of energy conservation a periodic driving can induce only @xmath8-thermalization  see  @xcite ) ) .",
    "in this paper we consider the entanglement properties of an integrable quantum spin chain .",
    "we focus on the entanglement entropy @xmath9 of a subchain of length @xmath10 for a quantum ising chain in transverse field undergoing a time - periodic driving of period @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the entanglement entropy increases linearly in time , until in the long - time limit an asymptotic @xmath0-periodic value @xmath11 is reached  . the asymptotic value , at leading order , is linear in @xmath10 : in the asymptotic regime the entropy follows a volume law , as occurs in the driven integrable system of  @xcite .",
    "we go beyond the results of ref .",
    "@xcite because  whatever is the form of the periodic drive  we are able to show this convergence analytically by means of floquet theory : we express the asymptotic value in terms of the floquet states of the driven system .",
    "moreover , we are able to provide a semi - analytical formula for the coefficient of the leading - order - in-@xmath10 term : we find that it is not only @xmath0-periodic but even time - independent .",
    "the system is integrable and locally relaxes to a non - thermal asymptotic condition  @xcite described by a special form of generalized gibbs ensemble ( gge ) density matrix  @xcite which we term floquet gge ( for more results on the gge in sudden quenches , see  @xcite ; refs .",
    "@xcite discuss in detail gge for sudden quenches in the quantum ising chain ) .",
    "we find that the leading - order - in-@xmath10 term in the asymptotic entanglement entropy is completely determined by the floquet gge .",
    "therefore , by means of the entanglement entropy , we see that relaxation to the gge occurs at arbitrarily large length scales . in agreement with the absence of thermalization ,",
    "the asymptotic entropy is always well below the completely mixed @xmath8 density matrix value @xmath12 and depends on the parameters of the driving : we can see marked peaks in the asymptotic entropy in correspondence to some non - equilibrium quantum phase transition of a floquet - state - analog of the ground state  @xcite .",
    "the behaviour we observe is peculiar to driven integrable systems . in the driven non - integrable case , on the contrary , there are two possibilities .",
    "if the dynamics is ergodic , then the entanglement entropy increases linearly in time until the completely mixed state value is eventually reached  @xcite ; in the many - body localized case , instead , the entanglement entropy shows a logarithmic increase  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ ising : sec ] we introduce the dynamics of the uniform quantum ising chain in a time - periodic transverse field .",
    "we discuss the application of floquet theory to this problem and introduce the form of the floquet gge density matrix describing the asymptotic periodic condition of local observables .",
    "section  [ enta_dyna : sec ] is the heart of this paper : we evaluate the entanglement entropy in the periodically driven case showing that the entanglement entropy for any subchain relaxes to an asymptotically periodic value .",
    "we show also that the leading term of the asymptotic value obeys a volume law ; we find a semi - analytical formula for this term and we see that it is completely determined by the floquet gge . in section  [ numerically : sec ] we show some numerical results corroborating our analysis and in section  [ conclusion : sec ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "most technical details and analytical derivations can be found in the appendices .",

    "we would like to emphasize that the picture above is strictly analogous to the well known situation of the relaxation to the gge of an integrable system with @xmath84 degrees of freedom after a quantum quench  @xcite .",

    "defining the eigenvalues of such a toeplitz matrix as @xmath96 , @xmath92 , the asymptotic entanglement entropy turns out to be given by @xmath97 all the details of the derivations of this expression are reported in  [ relaxation : sec ] .",
    "the discovery of this relaxation phenomenon is one of the main results of the paper .",

    "the coefficient @xmath100 is @xmath101 times the von neumann entropy of the floquet generalized gibbs ensemble density matrix @xmath63 ( eq .  ) .",

    "we can see that the transient lasts for a time linearly scaling with @xmath10 .",
    "it is not difficult to qualitatively understand this fact . in each point of the system",
    "the periodic drive generates quasi - particle excitations which propagate at finite velocity , bringing with them correlations : a longer subchain takes proportionally more time to get fully entangled with the rest of the system .",
    "this picture strictly resembles the case of quantum quench of  @xcite .",
    "it explains why the leading term in the asymptotic entanglement entropy follows a volume law : quasi - particles are generated in every point of the subchain so , after a while , the whole subchain is correlated with the rest of the system . in the top panels of fig .",
    "[ entroppo : fig ] we show the situation in the case of pbc on the spins ( abc on the fermions ) , in the bottom ones we consider the case of obc . in the second case the convergence to the asymptotic value is slower ( more or less ) by a factor 2 : we are considering a subchain with a loose end , and excitations can propagate only towards one direction .",
    "moreover , taking obc , the oscillations around the asymptotic value seem to be smaller than in the pbc case .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we would like to stress that in all the cases we have considered , @xmath109 is always well below the thermal @xmath8 value @xmath110 ( being the system periodically driven , due to the absence of energy conservation , it can only thermalize at @xmath8  @xcite ) .",
    "the system can not thermalize because it is integrable and locally relaxes to the floquet generalized gibbs ensemble eq .  .",
    "as we go to small frequencies , @xmath109 decreases .",
    "this is expected in the adiabatic limit , where the driving excites a vanishingly small number of excitations : there is indeed nothing which can propagate quantum correlations .",
    "the adiabatic limit occurs when the characteristic frequency scale of the perturbation is much smaller than the minimum energy gap encountered during the dynamics  @xcite .",
    "thanks to the factorization of the hamiltonian ( see eq .  ) , only the single - particle gaps ( those for each @xmath111 @xmath112subspace ) are important : the adiabatic limit hence corresponds to @xmath113 . from a numerical point of view",
    ", it would be quite time - consuming to consider very small frequencies in fig .",
    "[ sinfomega : fig ] .",
    "when the frequency is very small , the floquet spectrum undergoes multiple foldings in the first floquet - brillouin zone @xmath114 $ ] : as @xmath28 changes the quasi - energies @xmath115 undergo many avoided crossings . at each crossing",
    ", the quantities @xmath116 undergo quite sudden changes ( see the sm of  @xcite ) : hence the integrand in eq .",
    "is a strongly oscillating function of @xmath28 .",
    "for very low frequencies , we need indeed very fine meshes in @xmath28 ( hence , very long chains ) to obtain a good estimate of the integral .",
    "we have discussed the behaviour of the entanglement entropy in a time - periodically - driven quantum ising chain in transverse field . we have observed that the entanglement entropy relaxes asymptotically to a time - periodic value with the same period of the driving .",
    "the asymptotic entropy is attained after a transient in time whose duration scales linearly with the size of the subsystem ; we are able to express the asymptotic regime in terms of the floquet states of the driven system .",
    "the asymptotic entropy , at leading order , follows a volume law in the size of the chain : we have found a semi - analytical formula for the coefficient of the leading order term .",
    "quite remarkably , this coefficient is not periodic but time - independent ; its dependence on @xmath117 is reminiscent of quantum phase transitions of the floquet ground state .",
    "although following a volume law , the asymptotic entropy stays always well below the thermal value : the system is integrable and locally relaxes to a floquet gge ensemble .",
    "noteworthy , the leading term in the asymptotic entropy is proportional to the von neumann entropy of the floquet gge density matrix .",
    "so the floquet gge gives the asymptotic properties of the system at any arbitrarily long spatial scale @xmath10 .",
    "it is interesting to consider what happens to the picture we have described in the presence of disorder . in principle , arbitrary inhomogenous couplings can be tackled by the approach presented in [ bogoliubov : sec ] . but disorder should lead to localization of the states , and hence correlations should not be able to propagate efficiently  @xcite .",
