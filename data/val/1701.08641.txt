    "unlike its common perception , a vacuum is surprisingly strange and mysterious .",
    "although the name implies emptiness or nothingness , the reality is quite different . before the twentieth century , in order to come up with an explanation of the mysterious nature of light , a vacuum was often thought to be filled with aether that acted as a medium for the light wave .",
    "after einstein formulated special relativity without requiring aether , the idea of an aether - filled vacuum faded away .",
    "however , with the development of quantum theory , it soon became evident that even vacuums contain non - zero energy .",
    "this quantum effect became problematic again with physics at the cosmological scale .",
    "while the cosmological constant from observation yielded a value close to zero , the theoretical computation yielded a huge discrepancy @xcite .    in this paper , we wish to argue that this discrepancy may have resulted from the error of looking at the structure of the universe at the fundamental level . for centuries , science has been studied based on causality .",
    "that is , for a given result , there is a corresponding cause .",
    "this method of revealing an objective pattern in natural phenomenon began to shatter with the development of quantum mechanics at the beginning of the twentieth century . indeed , rather than the objective description for a given physical system , quantum theory started to describe the subjective relation between the observer and the object being observed .    in @xcite , it was noticed that this subjective description , which was often considered an incomplete aspect of a full description @xcite , may correspond to not only the limit of scientific knowledge but to existence itself . by considering the observable in quantum theory as the reference frame of the observing party",
    ", it was discussed that the two - picture formulation of quantum theory no longer correctly described self - observing consciousness .",
    "moreover , it was argued that this contradiction could be solved by changing the way we look at the structure of the universe at the fundamental level .",
    "that is , the observer and the object being observed ( i.e. , the universe ) , are inseparable .",
    "number of irreversible computations , fills up the universe @xcite .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    in @xcite , motivated by the black hole information problem @xcite , a more specific description of what it means for the observer and the universe to be inseparable has been provided . in particular , it was argued that the two - system measurement protocol , which places the observing party on the same footing as the object being observed objectively , could be made equivalent to the single - system copenhagen measurement protocol , which treats the observing party with a special status . in @xcite ,",
    "the argument with black hole case was extended to the cosmological model .",
    "in particular , the nature of negative sea was discussed in more detail by identifying it as the time reversal of the irreversible computation since the big bang . in this paper",
    ", we wish to discuss the difference between the theory and experiment in the context of the previously proposed universe model with negative sea , or the aether @xcite , filling up the universe .",
    "when the general theory of relativity was first published in 1915 , the universe was known to not be expanding or shrinking , at least in the cosmological scale .",
    "indeed , in order to come up with a static model of the universe , einstein originally introduced an additional constant term , @xmath3 , in his field equation .",
    "based on the assumption that the universe is isotropic , meaning it looks symmetric rotationally , and homogeneous , meaning its density is roughly the same anywhere , the metric can be simplified greatly at a sufficiently large scale . from the metric",
    ", einstein s field equation yields a solution which was found by friedman .",
    "this then implies adding a new vacuum energy density to the universe with @xmath4 .     to @xmath5 ( i.e. , in time - forward manner )",
    ", the classical vector @xmath6 chooses @xmath7 . in ( ii ) , the quantum vector @xmath8 evolves to equate itself with the classical vector from @xmath5 to @xmath9 .",
    "this cyclical process is equivalent to the self - observing consciousness discussed in @xcite .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    in 1998 , two research teams @xcite measured the cosmological parameters with the observation of a type ia supernova .",
    "surprisingly , it was found that the universe is accelerating in its expansion with non - zero cosmological constant value . in order to determine the value of @xmath3",
    ", astronomers used the equation that relates the luminosity of distant stars and the redshift , and the cosmological constant value was estimated to be @xmath10 while the vacuum energy density was estimated to be @xmath11 .    in @xcite ,",
    "the subjective aspect of existence was motivated by the contradiction appearing in the self - observation of consciousness .",
    "in particular , it was argued that one may consider the observable as the reference frame of the observer observing the given quantum system @xcite .",
    "another mysterious and highly debated subject was in regard to free will ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this is due to the newtonian deterministic worldview until the development of quantum theory .",
    "however , with randomness as an essential part of the theory , many suspected quantum theory may open the opportunity of free will . in fact",
    ", it has two seemingly contradictory aspects : first , the observer can freely choose ; second , the choice should be random and unpredictable .    , which therefore leads to the observation of the energy difference as seen in quantum theory .",
    "however , in the case of self - observing consciousness , the observer observes his or her own reference frame of @xmath0 as seen in ( ii ) .",
    "this is the case of vacuum observation .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    the statistical meaning of black hole entropy has been debated over the years @xcite , and the quantum memory model @xcite suggests that it corresponds in a number of ways to the observer s choice in measuring the black hole .",
    "it is interesting to note that free will associated with black hole entropy indeed has the dual aspect discussed above .",
    "that is , from the observer s subjective view , he or she is able to freely choose , yet its randomness comes from quantum probability .    in @xcite",
    ", it was further elaborated how free will may play an important role in building the model of the universe using nondeterministic computation .",
    "the nondeterministic computation chooses the acceptable path of computational process ( i.e. , the observer s choice ) , which is different from probabilistic computation @xcite . again , considering nondeterministic computation as free will fits the dual aspect discussed above . in computational complexity ,",
    "it is known as the language accepted by the algorithm .    , from @xmath9 to @xmath5 , the classical vector performs an irreversible computation with energy @xmath0 . from @xmath5 to @xmath9 , the quantum vector performs the computation with energy @xmath0 as well .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "it was discussed @xcite that , in the subjective model ( fig .",
    "[ diracsea ] ) , the entropy of the observable universe corresponds to a logarithm of possible choices the observer is able to choose .",
    "indeed , it was argued that among equally accessible microstates of the universe , existence corresponds to the observer s freely chosen will .",
    "therefore , the subjective model proposed in @xcite suggests that the observer s freely chosen will is actual existence , subjective reality , and it has the dual aspect of free will discussed earlier .    in order to discuss the difference between the observed and quantum vacuum energies ,",
    "let us review cyclical time @xcite .",
    "unlike linear time as commonly used in physics , cyclical time evolves from @xmath9 to @xmath5 , @xmath5 to @xmath12 , etc . , and",
    "at certain @xmath13 , @xmath14 evolves back to @xmath9 . in @xcite , a cyclical model of consciousness with @xmath15",
    "was introduced . as shown in fig .",
    "[ cyclical1 ] , two vectors are considered ; one is a quantum reference frame , or an observable , and the other is the corresponding classical vector .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , quantum vectors are defined in complex vector space , and the observation of these vectors takes place in classical space in terms of eigenvalues .",
    "therefore , the process of measurement involves the object of quantum vector and the corresponding classical vector , as well as the quantum and classical reference frames . in the case of self - observation ,",
    "the object to be observed is the reference frame itself ; therefore , only quantum and classical reference frames are considered , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cyclical1 ] .",
    "initially , both vectors are pointing at @xmath16 in the bloch sphere notation . from @xmath9 to @xmath5 , the classical reference frame points at @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "[ cyclical1 ] ( i ) ) . in the cyclical model ,",
    "@xmath5 evolves back to @xmath9 , which is the case of quantum evolution ( fig .",
    "[ cyclical1 ] ( ii ) ) .",
    "the interpretation could be considered as while the physical ( or classical ) choice is made in a time - forward manner , being aware of the choice is done through the quantum process ( i.e. , the dirac - type negative sea of consciousness ) .",
    "it is noted that the presented cyclical model of consciousness incorporates both the classical and quantum aspects and places them on an equal footing .     in a time - forward manner .",
    "the cyclical model adopts small and large cycles of time .",
    "( ii ) in one large cycle , the quantum vector may evolve backward in time all the way to the big bang with @xmath2 number of computations .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    let us now consider the cyclical process of consciousness in terms of energy .",
    "the unit of irreversible computation with dissipated energy , which will be called @xmath0 , was considered in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it was discussed that the degrees of freedom for reference frame ought to be the same as that of the state vectors .",
    "for example , if the outcome of a spin is up or down , the reference frame in measuring the spin is up or down as well . in a similar manner , in regard to the observation of energy states , the observer s reference frame is in one of the states as well .",
    "therefore , the observer observes only the relative difference ( fig .",
    "[ va ] ( i ) ) .",
    "however , in the case of consciousness , the observer is observing his or her own reference frame .    in the case of observing energy",
    ", the vacuum corresponds with the observer observing his or her own reference frame of the ground state energy ( fig .",
    "[ va ] ( ii ) ) . the observation of the vacuum energy as consciousness in cyclical time may be considered as follows : from @xmath9 to @xmath5 , the physical or classical irreversible computation is carried out with energy @xmath0 .",
    "next , the cyclical time evolution takes place , and , from @xmath5 to @xmath9 , the quantum process is carried with the energy of @xmath0 of negative sea ( fig .",
    "[ circle ] ) .    in @xcite ,",
    "small and large cycles of time were discussed . in particular , it was discussed that time circulates in small and large cycles in such a way that small cycles of time make up a larger cycle . for example , small cycles of seconds make up a larger cycle of a minute , minutes make up an hour , etc . the cyclical model of consciousness , as in fig .",
    "[ cyclical1 ] , may also be considered as a large cycle . as shown in fig .",
    "[ cyclical2 ] , while the classical vector chooses , i.e. , one unit of classical computation is carried out in the time forward manner , the quantum vector may evolve backward in time not only a single unit of computation as in fig .",
    "[ cyclical1 ] ( ii ) , but all the way back to big bang as seen in fig .",
    "[ diracsea ] with @xmath2 number of computations .",
    "the energy in the process of the classical computation should correspond to classical vacuum energy while the energy corresponding to the negative sea would be @xmath17 where @xmath2 is the number of computations since the big bang , which has been estimated in @xcite as , @xmath18    previously , it was often considered that the vacuum energy predicted from quantum theory may correspond to the observed value of the vacuum energy , which resulted in one of the largest discrepancies between the theory and experimental verification .",
    "however , as argued above and as a continuation of the specification of the subjective model , the energy calculated from quantum theory should correspond to the energy of the negative sea , or the aether , that fills up the universe as the conscious state of the observer ( fig . [",
    "fill ] ) .",
    "is filled with the dirac - type negative sea of energy @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number of computations since the big bang.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "we have discussed the difference between observed and theoretical values in regard to vacuum energy . in particular , we have used the previously proposed subjective model and the cyclical time to discuss that      that is , a classical vacuum should correspond to the unit of computation which is filled with the negative energy of the time - reversal process of irreversible computation since the big bang .",
    "one of the puzzling aspects in physics has been the seemingly different classical and quantum worlds . the argument presented in this paper explains how classical is connected to quantum in such a manner that it explains the difference between the classical and quantum vacuum energies .",
