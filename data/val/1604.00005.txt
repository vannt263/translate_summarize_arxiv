    "measurements by the firas ( far infrared absolute spectrometer ) instrument on - board the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) satellite demonstrated that the cmb spectrum is a perfect blackbody with a temperature @xmath2 k and limited deviations from a blackbody spectrum to @xmath3 ( mather et al . 1994 ; fixsen et al .",
    "1996 ; fixsen 2009 ) .",
    "since then , a main goal in astrophysical cosmology has been to determine precisely how much the cmb departs from a perfect blackbody spectrum .",
    "observations of such spectral distortions would help constrain inflationary models and yield other important information about the early history of the universe , including recombination of hydrogen and helium at redshifts @xmath46000 , the formation of the first stars , and the epoch of reionization ( e.g. , chluba & sunyaev 2012 ; chluba et al .",

    "thermalization processes erased distortions of the cmb .",
    "the blackbody spectrum was sustained by processes including compton scattering , bremsstrahlung ( zeldovich & sunyaev 1970 ; illarionov & sunyaev 1975a ; illarionov & sunyaev 1975b ) , and double compton scattering ( danese & de zotti 1982 ; burigana et al . 1991 ) . as the universe expanded and cooled , thermalization processes gradually became less efficient .",
    "by @xmath6 , energy released into the universe was capable of generating deviations , or distortions , into the cmb spectrum that may be observed today .",
    "the epoch of energy release dictates the kind of spectral distortions induced in the cmb spectrum .",
    "they are generally categorized into two types , named @xmath7- and @xmath8-type distortions .",
    "the former represents a frequency - dependent chemical potential , @xmath9 , that develops around @xmath10 , when compton processes bring photons into complete kinetic equilibrium with electrons . under these circumstances ,",
    "the cmb spectrum is described by a bose - einstein distribution , and any energy release yields a chemical potential described by @xmath9 ( e.g. , chluba & sunyaev 2012 ) . at lower redshifts ( @xmath11 ) , @xmath8-type distortions , also called compton-@xmath8 distortions , can form since the efficiency of compton processes decreases , and so kinetic equilibrium between photons and electrons is no longer realized .",
    "thus , due to incomplete thermalization of photons and electrons , low - frequency photons undergo small amounts of up - scattering , producing a @xmath8-type distortion . to date",
    ", the spectral distortions have not been detected , although cobe / firas has constrained them to @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( mather et al .",
    "1994 ; fixsen et al . 1996 ) .",
    "recently , however , new missions called the primordial inflation explorer ( pixie ; kogut et al . 2011 ) and the polarized radiation imaging and spectroscopy mission ( prism ; andr et al .",
    "2014 ) have been proposed that would exceed the spectral sensitivity limits of cobe / firas by 34 orders of magnitude .",
    "the greatly improved sensitivity of pixie will enable detections of cmb spectral distortions with @xmath14 and @xmath15 at the @xmath16 level ( kogut et al .",
    "prism is expected to detect @xmath7- and @xmath8-type distortions of few@xmath17 ( andr et al .",
    "2014 ; tashiro 2014 ) .    in anticipation of these missions , it is important to consider all possible sources of foreground contamination that could mask the signals we hope to detect .",
    "for instance , the pixie collaboration has focused on characterizing the dominant foregrounds of the galactic interstellar medium ( ism ) , in particular , polarized synchrotron radiation and thermal dust emission ( kogut et al .",
    "they determined that the galactic foregrounds and cmb emission could be disentangled due to their different frequency spectra ( see fig .",
    "4 of kogut et al . 2011 ) and distribution on the sky .",
    "extragalactic foreground contamination from continuum and spectral line emission is also a cause for concern . for instance",
    ", the diffuse co background from star - forming galaxies occupies the same frequency - space as does cmb emission .",
    "righi , hernndez - monteagudo , & sunyaev ( 2008 ) and de zotti et al .",
    "( 2015 ) estimated the signal of the redshift - integrated co emission . under different assumptions",
    ", both groups found that the co background signal is considerably higher than the pixie sensitivity , over various frequency ranges .",
    "recently , mashian et al . (",
    "2016 ) used large - velocity gradient ( lvg ) modeling to produce the complete co spectral line energy distribution from galaxies throughout cosmic history .",
    "they demonstrated that the cumulative co spectrum from star - forming galaxies , between @xmath18 and the present , lies 13 orders of magnitude above the pixie sensitivity to @xmath7- and @xmath8-type distortions in the frequency range 30300 ghz .",
    "to date , little attention has been given to the contamination of cmb distortions due to emission by intergalactic dust , which is the focus of this work .",
    "analogous to the reddening and attenuation of starlight due to interstellar dust in galaxies , light spanning ultraviolet ( uv ) to infrared ( ir ) frequencies is absorbed and scattered by dust grains as it passes through a dust - enriched intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "outflows from stars , supernova explosions , and active galactic nuclei winds are all mechanisms that may contribute to the expulsion of dust from galaxies into the igm . the enrichment of the igm by heavy elements has been modeled by a number of studies ( e.g. , cen & ostriker 1999 ; aguirre et al .",

    "we also consider the contribution of the cmb at a temperature , @xmath31 . for the dust opacity , @xmath32 , in equation ( [ eq : tdust ] )",
    ", we adopt the galactic extinction laws of mathis ( 1990 ) and li & draine ( 2001 ) .",

    "the intensity of emission from intergalactic dust , @xmath59 , is obtained from equation ( [ eq : nnu ] ) via @xmath60 .",
    "knowledge of the evolution of the dgr is limited , since it requires measurements of the dust mass density at different epochs .",
    "such measurements are especially difficult to obtain at high redshifts due to challenges associated with disentangling the contributions to dust emission ( or extinction ) from various sources along a given line of sight . in imara & loeb ( 2016 ) , we constrained the dgr in the igm at discrete redshifts by comparing our theoretical predictions of the optical depth due to dust with observations of dust extinction from the literature .",
    "we estimated a dgr of @xmath61 at @xmath62 , using optical extinction measurements of mnard et al .",
    "( 2010 ) at the same redshift . at higher redshifts , @xmath63",
    ", we utilized upper limits of dust extinction observations to set upper bounds on the dgr . figure [ fig : dgr ] displays a plot of dgr(@xmath41 ) from @xmath37 to 4 , obtained by interpolating through the discrete calculations of the dgr predicted in imara & loeb ( 2016 ) .",
    "we use these interpolated values to solve for @xmath55 in equation ( [ eq : rho ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that for @xmath64 , the curve in figure [ fig : dgr ] should be regarded as an upper limit to the dgr .",
    "therefore , estimates of @xmath55 for @xmath64 will be upper limits . for @xmath65 , we assume a constant dgr of 0.11 , though we expect , in reality , the dgr in the igm will increase approaching toward @xmath37 .",
    "thus , calculations of @xmath66 should be considered lower limits .",
    "with models for the extragalactic background and the dust opacity , we solve equation ( [ eq : tdust ] ) for @xmath27  and plot the result in figure [ fig : tdust ] .",
    "the plot also shows the history of the cmb temperature ( dashed line ) .",
    "figure [ fig : ycz ] displays the `` effective @xmath8-parameter , '' @xmath44 , as a function of redshift , the result of numerically integrating equations ( [ eq : yc])([eq : rho ] ) . in the following , we discuss the assumptions that influence our results (  [ sec : unc ] ) , and we forecast how the foreground emission due to intergalactic dust compares with the cmb spectral distortions that pixie and other future experiments hope to detect (  [ sec : distort ] ) .",
    "fortunately , our calculations should not be biased by the clustering of sources , since thermal dust emission is spectrally smooth .",
    "unlike estimates of the co foreground , for instance , which has frequency fluctuations resulting from the clustering of sources on the sky ( mashian et al .",
    "2016 ) , the calculations performed here are not hampered by lack of knowledge of the spatial distribution of dust - emitting sources .",
    "our calculation of @xmath67 , however , is contingent on a number of uncertain factors involving the intrinsic properties of intergalactic dust , such as its opacity and dgr . for the dust extinction law , we assume a galactic model consisting of a combination of silicate and carbonaceous grains , with a selective extinction of @xmath68 ( see li & draine 2001 ) .",
    "the selective extinction defines the slope of the extinction curve in the optical band from @xmath69 .",
    "smaller grains tend to scatter light at shorter wavelengths , corresponding to a steeper slope and smaller values of @xmath70 .",
    "aguirre ( 1999 ) and bianchi & ferrara ( 2005 ) propose that small dust grains are preferentially destroyed during the processes that expel dust from galaxies .",
    "if correct , and if intergalactic dust has a size distribution skewed towards larger grains than the milky way , this would suggest higher values of @xmath70 than in the milky way . on the other hand , if the rarefied , low - metallicity igm is better described by dust with a grain size distribution more akin to a low - metallicity galaxy such as the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , this would correspond to @xmath71 .",
    "it has been suggested that the low - metallicity of the smc contributes to the suppression of dust grain growth in the bar of this galaxy , in which @xmath72 ( e.g. , bouchet et al .",
    "1985 ; gordon et al . 2003 ) .    the uncertainties in the opacity , @xmath32 , and the dgr are directly proportional to changes in @xmath44  and are multiplicative .",
    "that is , changing @xmath32 by a factor @xmath73 or the dgr by a factor @xmath74 results in a change to @xmath44  by a factor of @xmath75 .",
    "nevertheless , in imara & loeb ( 2016 ) , we demonstrated that the estimated optical depth and dgr of the low-@xmath41 igm are fairly robust to changes in the selective extinction .",
    "we calculated the optical depth due to igm dust averaged along arbitrary lines of sight and showed that at low redshifts , the derived optical depths  and thus , the derived dgrs  are nearly identical for @xmath76 .      in figures [ fig : nu ] and [ fig : inua ] we present predictions of the foreground intergalactic dust emission between @xmath37 and 10 . in figure [",
    "fig : nu ] , the amount of dust emission as a function of frequency is given in terms of @xmath77 , the ratio of number density of photons produced by dust emission to that of the cmb .",
    "the dust emission is expressed in terms of intensity , @xmath59 , in figure [ fig : inua ] .",
    "the solid black curves in both figures represent lower limits obtained by considering the contribution of dust only up to redshift @xmath78 .",
    "these are lower limits for two main reasons .",
    "first , our derivation of the dust emission spectrum for @xmath65 does not include the contribution from igm dust at higher redshifts , for which we have only upper limits on the dgr .",
    "second , we assume a constant dgr between @xmath37 and 0.5 , based on the mnard et al . ( 2010 ) detection of intergalactic extinction at @xmath62 ( see  [ sec : yc ] ) .",
    "if the dgr rises towards @xmath37 , as might be expected since galaxies will have had more time to expel dust into the igm , the foreground due to dust emission would also increase above the spectrum derived here . in figures [ fig : nu ] and [ fig : inua ] , we also show upper limits to the level of dust emission , derived for contributions of dust from @xmath79 ( dashed line ) , @xmath80 ( dash - dot line ) , and @xmath81 ( dotted line ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : inub ] , together with @xmath59 , we show the deviations from the cmb blackbody spectrum as determined by fixsen et al .",
    "( 1996 ) from cobe / firas measurements .",

    "the instrument sensitivity of pixie is @xmath87 in each of the 400 frequency bins ( kogut et al .",
    "this will allow pixie to detect distortions with @xmath88 and @xmath89 at the @xmath16 level ( kogut et al .",
    "2011a ; chluba 2013 ; chluba & jeong 2014 ) .",
    "( note that the anticipated sensitivity of prism surpasses that of pixie by roughly an order of magnitude . )",
    "we enter these values into equations ( [ eq : inu_mu ] ) and ( [ eq : inu_y ] ) to obtain the curves in figure [ fig : inub ] .",
    "as can be seen in the figure , below @xmath90 ghz , the intergalactic dust foreground remains below the @xmath16 sensitivity limit of the @xmath8-type distortions . at higher frequencies ,",
    "the dust foreground exceeds pixie s sensitivity to @xmath8-type distortions by @xmath91 orders of magnitude . contamination due to intergalactic dust is a bigger problem for @xmath7-type distortions over a broader range of frequencies . for @xmath92 ghz ,",
    "the intergalactic dust foreground exceeds the pixie sensitivity to @xmath7-type distortions by at least 13 orders of magnitude .",
    "the upper limits for @xmath59  derived at @xmath93 and @xmath94 lie almost entirely above the pixie sensitivity to cmb distortions at the @xmath16 level .",
    "for instance , the curve representing an upper limit on igm dust emission since @xmath93 is @xmath91 orders of magnitude higher than the pixie sensitivity to @xmath8-type distortions over the entire bandwidth of the instrument .",
    "the upper limit on intergalactic dust emission since @xmath94 is as much as 3 orders of magnitude higher the pixie sensitivity to @xmath8-type distortions .",
    "for @xmath95 ghz , the frequency range of cobe / firas , the intensity of the predicted dust emission is @xmath96100 times weaker than the cobe / firas upper limits on the spectral distortions , which likely explains why the dust foreground has hitherto eluded detection .",
    "thus , for both @xmath8- and @xmath7-type distortions , it is not possible to entirely rule out the contribution of intergalactic dust at redshifts @xmath97 to the cumulative foreground emission . getting a better sense of just how much igm dust at all redshifts contributes to the foreground emission requires precise measurements of the intergalactic dgr at higher redshifts .",
    "still , it is clear that in order to take full advantage of pixie , prism , and similar future experiments ability to measure spectral distortions , a sophisticated subtraction of the foreground emission due to intergalactic dust is necessary .",
