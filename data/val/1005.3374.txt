    ", environments may be very complex systems characterized by many uncontrollable degrees of freedom .",
    "a useful active strategy to defend quantum coherence of a processing against environmental noise is that of quantum error correcting codes ( qecc ) perimeter , knill97 , calderbank97 where , in analogy to classical information theory , quantum information is stabilized by using redundant encoding and measurements .    the formal mathematical description of the qubit - environment interaction is often given in terms of quantum channels .",
    "quantum error correction is usually developed under the assumption of i.i.d .",
    "( identically and independently distributed ) errors .",
    "these error models are characterized by memoryless communication channels @xmath0 such that @xmath1-channel uses is given by @xmath2 .",
    "in such cases of complete independent decoherence , qubits interact with their own environments which do not interact with each other .",
    "however , in actual physical situations , qubits may interact with a common environment which unavoidably introduces correlations in the noise .",
    "for instance , there are situations where qubits in a ion trap set - up are collectively coupled to their vibrational modes @xcite . in other situations , different qubits in a quantum dot design are coupled to the same lattice , thus interacting with a common thermal bath of phonons @xcite .",
    "the exchange of bosons between qubits causes spatial and temporal correlations that violate the condition of error independence @xcite .",
    "memory effects introduce correlations among channel uses with the consequence that @xmath3 .",
    "recent studies try to characterize the effect of correlations on the performance of qeccs @xcite .",
    "it appears that correlations may have negative @xcite or positive @xcite impact on qeccs depending on the features of the error model being considered .",
    "furthermore , the noise may be asymmetric .",
    "most of the quantum computing devices @xcite are characterized by relaxation times ( @xmath4 ) that are one - two orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding dephasing times ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "relaxation leads to both bit - flip and phase - flip errors , whereas dephasing ( loss of phase coherence , phase - shifting ) only leads to phase - flip errors .",
    "such asymmetry between @xmath6 and @xmath5 translates to an asymmetry in the occurrence probability of bit - flip ( @xmath7 ) and phase - flip errors ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath9 is known as the channel asymmetry .",
    "quantum error correction schemes should be designed in such a way that no resources ( time and qubits ) are wasted in attempting to detect and correct errors that may be relatively unlikely to occur .",
    "quantum codes should be designed in order to exploit this asymmetry and provide better performance by neglecting the correction of less probable errors @xcite .",
    "indeed , examples of efficient quantum error - correcting codes ( for instance , asymmetric stabilizer csscodes ) taking advantage of this asymmetry are given by families of codes of the calderbank - shor - steane ( css ) type @xcite .",
    "following these lines of investigations , in this article we study the performance of common quantum stabilizer codes in the presence of asymmetric and correlated errors . specifically , we consider the depolarizing noisy quantum memory channel and perform quantum error correction via the five and seven - qubit stabilizer codes @xcite .",
    "we characterize the performance of the codes by means of the entanglement fidelity @xmath10 @xcite as function of the error probability @xmath11 and degree of memory @xmath12 ( correlations ) .",

    "the error correction schemes here considered only work for low values of @xmath12 . furthermore , we uncover that the asymmetry in the error probabilities does not affect the performance of the five - qubit code while it does affect the performance of the seven - qubit code which results less effective when considering correlated and symmetric depolarizing errors , but more effective for correlated and asymmetric errors .",
