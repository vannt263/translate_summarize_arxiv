    "study of stepped crystalline surfaces offers an exquisite combination of questions of fundamental physical interest and importance for technological development .",
    "these surfaces play a central role in the modern electronics industry , where they serve as templates in the computer chip manufacturing process .",
    "the ability to model and quantify the evolution of such surfaces and ultimately engineer surface structures over a wide range of length and time scales will be essential for designing the next generation of computer chip components @xcite . even on the flattest of surfaces ,",
    "e.g.  si(111 ) , steps are inevitable on the submicron scale due to minor misorientations from facet directions . for metallic surfaces , steps appear on the scale of 100 nm . in some cases",
    "they provide a mechanism of stress relief @xcite .    in applications to electronics , template surfaces",
    "are often grown epitaxially : material , usually in the form of atoms or molecules , is sputtered onto a crystalline substrate ; the goal is to grow layer by layer with as few defects as possible .",
    "many excellent books discuss this general problem from a variety of perspectives ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if one starts with a flat surface , growth begins at random nucleation sites .",
    "islands expand around these sites .",
    "eventually the boundaries of the islands meet . if the atoms in two abutting islands are in different domains , then a domain wall forms between them .",
    "such walls persist during growth and can not readily be annealed away . instead",
    ", it is advisable to begin with a substrate that is intentionally slightly misoriented ( typically by a few degrees ) from flat , high - symmetry orientation .",
    "such surfaces are called  vicinal \" since they are in the vicinity of the facet orientation .",
    "they consist of a series of atomically flat terraces , separated from one another by surface steps  boundaries where the surface height changes by an atomic unit .",
    "ordinarily the adsorption energy of a deposited atom is greatest at the crease at the lower edge of a step , since there it can bind to the largest number of other atoms .",
    "thus , if the temperature is high enough so that the atoms diffuse relatively rapidly and the flux low enough , the atoms will be more likely to attach to the step edge than to meet another deposited atom to form a nucleation center on a terrace .",
    "then , in this regime of  step - flow growth , \" the steps will gradually move across the terrace until , after deposition of a monolayer , the surface looks very similar to the initial vicinal surface , only with one more layer .",
    "since steps play such a fundamental role , it is crucial to understand their properties and especially to clarify the few basic parameters that determine their behavior .",
    "the lowest - energy excitation of a stepped surface is the kink , a unit deviation perpendicular to the mean direction of the step . since the energy to create an isolated atom or vacancy defect on a terrace",
    "is several times that to create a kink , kinks are the predominant defect on equilibrated surfaces at low temperatures .",
    "while these kinks cost energy , they contribute to the entropy in the usual way , so that in equilibrium this competition leads to the step free energy per length @xmath0 , or line tension @xcite . in an expansion of the projected free energy per area of a vicinal surface ( i.e. , the surface free energy per area of the vicinal surface projected onto the terrace plane ) , @xmath0 is the coefficient of the density of steps .",
    "( at the roughening transition of the terrace plane , @xmath0 vanishes and the projected free energy per area becomes quadratic in the density of steps ; the vicinal surface is in this technical sense rough already at the lower temperatures under consideration . ) in other words , the line tension indicates the extra energy associated with a unit length of a step .",
    "steps need not run along high - symmetry directions , i.e. the surface normal ( or azimuthal misorientation ) can be at an arbitrary polar angle @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the border of a single - layer island ( or vacancy island ) is just a step that is a closed curve  somewhere between circular and polygonal  rather than a nearly straight line .",
    "the celebrated wulff construction @xcite uses @xmath2 to determine the equilibrium crystal shape that minimizes the free energy at constant area .",
    "the thermal excitation of kinks along the step leads to meandering .",
    "such fluctuations are constrained by the stiffness @xmath3 , which weights the squared slope of the step relative to its mean direction @xcite .",
    "( there is an analogy between the ensemble of spatial configurations of the steps in 2d ( two dimensions ) and the world lines of particles evolving in 1d ; in this picture , the deviation of the slope is analogous to velocity , so the wandering corresponds to kinetic energy , with stiffness playing the role of mass . )",
    "furthermore , it is the stiffness that weights the curvature in the gibbs - thomson term , the curvature contribution to the step or interface energy .",
    "thus , in many ways @xmath4 is more fundamental than @xmath2 and in some situations is better defined @xcite .",
    "accordingly , stiffness is one of the three parameters of the step continuum model , which retains distinct steps but coarse - grains them into continuous  strings . \"",
    "the other two parameters are the strength of the inverse - separation - squared repulsion between steps and the characteristic rate of the mechanism dominating step kinetics .",
    "then , at the mesoscopic scale , such surfaces can be envisioned as a collection of steps separating atomically flat terraces and effectively tracing out surface contour plots . by tracking the net movement , fluctuations , and interactions of steps",
    ", the evolution of the entire surface can be monitored .",
    "the actual motion of atoms  at much smaller length and time scales  which underlies this behavior appears only in the parameters , which can be estimated from either calculation ( or measurement ) of atomic processes or by fitting to data at the mesoscale .",
    "this idea , at the heart of the step - continuum model @xcite , turns out to be an extremely efficient way of tracking surface evolution over a wide range of experimentally relevant length and time scales .",
    "this picture has been used to successfully account for a broad range of step properties , such as mound decay , step and island fluctuations , cluster diffusion , electromigration , and ripening @xcite .",
    "since one can never be certain of including all significant atomistic - scale processes , the most meaningful test of the step continuum model is the check that the same set of parameters describes quantitatively all these varied phenomena .",
    "one can then return to the microscopic picture , invoke a simple model , and fit the key model parameters as _ effective _ values to reproduce the mesoscopic behavior . if reliable energetic calculations give agreement with these predictions , all the better .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the two densest , highest - symmetry faces of an fcc crystal , namely \\{100 } and \\{111 } , which have square and hexagonal symmetry , respectively .",
    "( for \\{111 } surfaces , if one imagines adsorption into both kinds of 3-fold sites [ fcc and hcp ] , one has a honeycomb .",
    "this feature is unimportant for what we consider here . )",
    "late transition and noble metals have fcc crystal structure and make good substrates for the sorts of experiments envisioned here , since they are relatively soft , with atomic motion occurring adequately for equilibration at room temperature or at somewhat higher . as the close - packed bravais structure",
    ", there is less angular dependence on bonding , making near - neighbor models better approximations than for bcc metals .",
    "note that \\{100 } and \\{111 } faces of all cubic bravais crystals have square and hexagonal symmetry , respectively .",
    "so does si and other systems with the diamond structure .",
    "if one assumes that step adatoms interact with only nearest - neighbors ( nn ) or next - nearest - neighbors ( nnn ) , then it is possible to derive exact solutions for the line tension based on the ising or solid - on - solid ( sos ) models .",
    "these solutions are implicit , however , making their implementation into numerical simulations time - consuming and computationally demanding , particularly when dealing with the stiffness , which requires two additional derivatives of the implicit line tension . for simplicity ,",
    "then , numerical studies often @xcite ( though by no means always @xcite ) assume an isotropic line tension and stiffness .",
    "except at high temperatures where an island structure is nearly circular , this approximation turns out to be poor , especially near facet orientations , where the line tension is notably smaller , and would be much smaller if there is a quasi - straight - edge ( 2d  facet \" at macroscopic scales the island is rounded at finite temperature @xcite ) . for the stiffness ,",
    "the problem is more severe , since @xmath5 is large near these special directions ( though not infinite as it would be in 3d ) , leading to a stiffness much greater than the value at general orientations .",
    "since it is easier to compute @xmath4 in such high - symmetry directions , such values have been used to characterize @xmath4 at general @xmath1 , thereby considerably overestimating the typical stiffness .",
    "the next simplest approximation assumes a sinusoidal variation reflecting the substrate symmetry @xcite .",
    "again , there are shortcomings to this procedure , especially near facet orientations , about which polar plots of the line tension as a function of angle reveal sharp , cusp - like minima , implying the stiffness blows up ( since the curvature of a cusp is infinite ) .",
    "such temperature - independent simplifications preclude quantitative comparisons with experiment @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we construct expressions for @xmath2 and @xmath6 that are well behaved analytically , being continuous and twice differentiable and that give an accurate accounting at all orientations and relevant temperatures .",
    "for convenience , all derived formulas are summarized in table  5.1 . while not especially simple , they are straightforward to construct and easy to implement in numerical codes such as used in finite - element investigations @xcite , making quantitative comparisons with dynamic experiments possible .",
    "we thus expect our results to be widely applicable .",
    "our approach begins with simple , low - temperature formulas for the orientation dependence , on face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) surfaces , of the \\{001 } and \\{111 } stiffness and line tension that we derived in two recent papers @xcite .",
    "( this approach is rooted in the lattice - gas perspective , so is complementary to shenoy and ciobanu s study of stiffness anisotropy based on elasticity theory @xcite . )",
    "our formulas assume the step fluctuations are dominated by the rearrangement of geometrically forced kinks ",
    "kinks that are not thermally activated . at temperatures low compared to the surface roughening temperature ( for noble metal surfaces , such as ag and cu , room temperature is considered `` low '' ) , the formulas only fail for steps having a negligible number of forced kinks ; that is , steps oriented very close to the high - symmetry direction .",
    "when the step angle is exactly 0@xmath7 ( aligned with the high - symmetry direction ) , the formulas predict a cusp in the line - tension and an infinite step stiffness . here",
    "we correct for the non - analytic behavior by splicing our simple , low - temperature formulas with small - angle expansions of the exact , implicit solutions based on the ising and sos models .    in the following section ,",
    "we describe the details of a general expansion for the stiffness and line tension that is continuous and twice - differentiable . in sections",
    "iii and iv , we apply this expansion to fcc \\{111 } and \\{001 } surfaces , respectively , to derive surface - specific formulas for the stiffness and line tension . in the final section ,",
    "we offer concluding remarks as well as a synopsis of the derived expressions .",
    "at the microscopic level , the step stiffness and line tension arise from the energy and rearrangement of step edge kinks .",
    "it is therefore natural to decompose @xmath6 and @xmath2 into two contributions : one part originating from geometrically forced kinks and one part from thermally activated kinks .",
    "geometrically forced kinks , depicted in the inset of fig .  [ fig : smallangleexpsample ] , are present at all temperatures , and give the step an overall orientation @xmath1 .",
    "the further @xmath1 is from the high - symmetry direction , the greater the number of geometrically forced kinks .",
    "thus , at lower temperatures , as long as the orientation angle of a step is _ greater _ than some small , temperature - dependent cross - over angle @xmath8 , there are many geometrically forced kinks and relatively few thermally activated kinks , suggesting @xmath6 and @xmath2 can be well described by formulas based on geometrically forced kinks alone .    as an example , we have recently derived @xcite a remarkably simple , low - temperature formula for the \\{111 } step stiffness assuming only nn adatom interactions and geometrically forced kinks : @xmath9        [ fig : smallangleexpsample ]    at sufficiently low ( but experimentally relevant ) temperatures , the formula works well for steps at nearly all angles , but predicts an infinite stiffness when @xmath10 .",
    "fortunately , the exact , implicit solution based on the nn ising model can be explicitly written for steps having this orientation .",
    "we can therefore expand the exact solution about @xmath10 and splice it with our low - temperature solution at @xmath8 , thereby producing an explicit form for @xmath6 valid at all angles .",
    "this idea is illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ fig : smallangleexpsample ] ) . here , an additional orientation - independent contribution to the stiffness from thermally activated kinks @xmath11",
    "is also included for completeness .",
    "similar to high - symmetry steps , the stiffness of maximally kinked steps ( @xmath12 ) can be exactly obtained from the nn ising model , so that @xmath11 can be determined explicitly .    to generalize this approach ,",
    "we assume @xmath6 and @xmath2 are well described at angles _ greater _ than @xmath8 by simple , analytic functions representing contributions from geometrically forced kinks .",
    "explicit forms for these functions @xcite will be discussed later . for now , to be general , we simply write them as @xmath13 .    at sufficiently low temperatures ,",
    "@xmath8 is small , so we may accurately represent @xmath2 and the inverse stiffness @xmath14 at angles _ less _ than @xmath8 using small - angle expansions .",
    "( we expand the inverse stiffness because , in the @xmath1=0 limit , it vanishes at low temperatures , making it mathematically better behaved than the stiffness itself , which diverges ) .",
