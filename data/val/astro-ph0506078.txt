    "supernovae of type ia ( sne  ia ) at redshifts @xmath3 appear fainter than expected from the luminosity - redshift relation in a decelerating universe  @xcite . on the other hand , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy and",
    "large - scale structure observations suggest that the universe is spatially flat , with a matter density of approximately 30% of the critical density  @xcite .",
    "the `` concordance model '' thus implies that the universe must be accelerating today because it is dominated by a `` dark energy '' component ( about 70% of the critical density ) with an equation of state @xmath4 .",
    "the lack of a satisfactory fundamental explanation for this component has triggered wide - ranging theoretical investigations of more or less exotic scenarios  @xcite .",
    "some years ago cski , kaloper and terning  @xcite ( ckt  i ) suggested that the observed achromatic dimming of distant sne  ia may be a consequence of the mixing of photons with very light and weakly coupled axion - like particles in the intergalactic magnetic fields . though still requiring some non - standard fluid ( e.g.  with @xmath5 ) to fit the flatness of the universe , this model seemed capable to explain the sn dimming through a completely different mechanism without apparently affecting other cosmological observations .",
    "later it was recognized that the conclusions of ckt  i can be significantly modified when the effects of the intergalactic plasma on the photon - axion oscillations are taken into account  @xcite .",
    "assuming an electron density @xmath6 , the model is ruled out in most of the parameter space because of either an excessive photon conversion or a chromaticity of the dimming .",
    "only fine - tuned parameters for the statistical properties of the extragalactic magnetic fields would still allow this explanation .",
    "on the other hand , cski , kaloper and terning  @xcite ( ckt  ii ) criticized the assumed value of @xmath0 as being far too large for most of the intergalactic space , invoking observational hints for a value at least one order of magnitude smaller .",
    "for @xmath7  @xmath8 , the photon - axion mixing hypothesis works even better with the plasma , because the constraints from cmb anisotropies via photon - axion conversion can be relaxed .",
    "if distant sne  ia are dimmed by this mechanism , the same would apply to other sources .",
    "in particular , one would expect a dispersion in the observed quasar ( qso ) spectra .",
    "an analysis based on the first data release of the sloan digital sky survey excludes a large part of the parameter space  @xcite , suggesting that only for @xmath9  @xmath8 the axion mechanism is still able to explain a dimming by @xmath10 magnitudes or more .",
    "if the qso spectra had an intrinsic dispersion at the 5% level would rule out axion dimming exceeding @xmath11  0.05  mag .",
    "future data will be sensitive to yet larger regions in parameter space , yet qsos will never be sensitive to very low @xmath0 .",
    "a similar bound has been obtained by a possible violation of the reciprocity relation between the luminosity distance and the angular - diameter distance  @xcite . however , this constraint is less robust than the qso one because it is affected by possibly large systematic errors that are difficult to quantify  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of our paper is to further constrain the photon - axion conversion model by studying its effect on the cmb spectral shape",
    ". we will show that the low-@xmath0 region of parameters left open by the qso limit is ruled out by our new limit , leaving little if any room for the axion hypothesis to mimic cosmic acceleration .    in sec .",

    "the mixing matrix is @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "the component of @xmath25 parallel to the direction of motion does not induce photon - axion mixing .",
    "the quantities @xmath26 with @xmath27 mix the photon polarization states . they are energy dependent and are determined both by the properties of the medium and the qed vacuum polarization effect .",
    "we ignore the latter , being sub - dominant for the problem at hand  @xcite .    for a homogeneous magnetic field we may choose a coordinate system aligned with the field direction .",
    "the linear photon polarization state parallel to the transverse field direction @xmath28 is denoted as @xmath29 and the orthogonal one as @xmath30 .",
    "equation  ( [ linsys1 ] ) becomes then @xmath31 with mixing matrix @xmath32 here , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 defines the plasma frequency , @xmath38 being the electron mass and @xmath39 the fine - structure constant .",
    "the @xmath40 terms describe the cotton - mouton effect , i.e.  the birefringence of fluids in the presence of a transverse magnetic field where @xmath41 .",
    "these terms are of little importance for the following arguments and will thus be neglected . the faraday rotation term @xmath42 , which depends on the energy and the longitudinal component @xmath43 , couples the modes @xmath44 and @xmath45 . while faraday rotation is important when analyzing polarized sources of photons , it plays no role for the problem at hand .    with this simplification",
    "the @xmath30 component decouples , and the propagation equations reduce to a 2-dimensional mixing problem with a purely transverse field",
    "@xmath46 @xmath47 with a 2-dimensional mixing matrix @xmath48 the solution follows from diagonalization through the rotation angle @xmath49 in analogy to the neutrino case  @xcite , the probability for a photon emitted in the state @xmath44 to convert into an axion after traveling a distance @xmath50 is @xmath51 where the oscillation wavenumber is given by @xmath52 the conversion probability is energy - independent when @xmath53 or whenever the oscillatory term in eq .",

    "( [ p1ga ] ) .",
    "as expected one finds that for @xmath59 the conversion probability saturates , so that on average one third of all photons converts to axions .",
    "to explore the effect of photon - axion conversion on sn dimming we recast the relevant physical quantities in terms of natural parameter values .",
    "the energy of optical photons is a few  ev .",
    "the strength of widespread , all - pervading @xmath1-fields in the intergalactic medium must be less than a few  @xmath60  g over coherence lengths @xmath50 crudely at the mpc scale , according to the constraint coming from the faraday effect of distant radio sources  @xcite . along a given line of sight , the number of such domains in our hubble radius is about @xmath61 for @xmath62  mpc .",
    "the mean diffuse intergalactic plasma density is bounded by @xmath63  @xmath8 , corresponding to the recent wmap measurement of the baryon density  @xcite .",
    "recent results from the cast experiment  @xcite give a direct experimental bound on the axion - photon coupling of @xmath64  gev@xmath65 , comparable to the long - standing globular - cluster limit  @xcite .",
    "for ultra - light axions a stringent limit from the absence of @xmath66-rays from sn  1987a gives @xmath67  gev@xmath65  @xcite or even @xmath68  gev@xmath65  @xcite .",
    "therefore , suitable numerical values of the mixing parameters are @xmath69 where we have introduced @xmath70 gev@xmath65 and @xmath71 is the magnetic field strength in nano - gauss .    the mixing angle defined in eq .",
    "( [ tan ] ) is too small to yield a significant conversion effect for the allowed range of axion masses because @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , to ensure a sufficiently large mixing angle one has to require nearly massless pseudo - scalars , sometimes referred to as `` arions ''  . henceforth we will consider the pseudoscalars to be effectively massless , so that our remaining independent parameters are @xmath73 and @xmath0 . note that @xmath74 only enters the equations via the term @xmath75 , so that for tiny but non - vanishing values of @xmath74 , the electron density should be interpreted as @xmath76 .",
    "the distance relevant for sn  ia dimming is the luminosity distance @xmath77 at redshift @xmath19 , defined by @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the absolute luminosity of the source and @xmath80 is the energy flux arriving at earth  @xcite .",
    "usually the data are expressed in terms of magnitudes @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the absolute magnitude , equal to the value that @xmath83 would have at @xmath84 pc .",
    "after a distance @xmath85 , photon - axion conversion has reduced the number of photons emitted by the source and thus the flux @xmath80 to the fraction @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , the luminosity distance becomes @xmath87 and the brightness @xmath88 distant sne  ia would eventually saturate ( @xmath89 ) , and hence they would appear @xmath90 times farther away than they really are .",
    "this corresponds to a maximum dimming of approximately 0.4  mag .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show qualitatively the regions of @xmath0 and @xmath73 relevant for sn dimming at cosmological distances . to this end",
    "we show iso - dimming contours obtained from eq .",
    "( [ isodim ] ) for a photon energy 4.0  ev and a magnetic domain size @xmath91  mpc . for simplicity",
    "we neglect the redshift evolution of the intergalactic magnetic field @xmath1 , domain size @xmath50 , plasma density @xmath0 and photon frequency @xmath22 .",
    "our iso - dimming curves are intended to illustrate the regions where the photon - axion conversion could be relevant . in reality",
    ", the dimming should be a more complicated function since the intergalactic medium is expected to be very irregular : there could be voids of low @xmath0 density , but there will also be high density clumps , sheets and filaments and these will typically have higher @xmath1 fields as well .",
    "however , the simplifications used in this work are consistent with the ones adopted in ckt ii model and do not alter our main results .",
    "the iso - dimming contours are horizontal in the low-@xmath0 and low-@xmath73 region .",
    "they are horizontal for any @xmath73 when @xmath0 is sufficiently low . from the discussion in sec .",
    "[ formalism ] we know that the single - domain probability @xmath58 of eq .",
    "( [ p1ga ] ) is indeed energy independent when @xmath92 , i.e.  for @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "when @xmath95",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath96 , we do not expect an oscillatory behavior of the probability .",
    "this feature is nicely reproduced in our iso - dimming contours . from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we also deduce that a significant amount of dimming is possible only for @xmath97 .    in ckt",
    "i , where the effect of @xmath0 was neglected , a value @xmath98 ev was used . in terms of our variables",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath99  @xmath8 . as noted in ckt  ii , when plasma effects are taken into account , any value @xmath100",
    "@xmath8 guarantees the required achromaticity of the dimming below the 3% level between the b and v bands .",
    "the choice @xmath71 of a few and @xmath101 in ckt  i and  ii falls in the region where the observed sn dimming could be explained while being marginally compatible with the bounds on @xmath1 and @xmath102 .",
    "if @xmath103 conversion over cosmological distances is responsible for the sn  ia dimming , the same phenomenon should also leave an imprint in the cmb .",
    "we note that a similar argument was previously considered for photon@xmath104graviton conversion  @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , in the energy - dependent region of @xmath105 one expects a rather small effect due to the low energy of cmb photons ( @xmath106  ev ) .",
    "however , when accounting for the incoherent integration over many domains crossed by the photon , appreciable spectral distortions may arise in view of the accuracy of the cmb data ( at the level of one part in @xmath107@xmath108 ) . for the same reason , in the energy - independent region , at much lower values of @xmath0 than for the sne  ia ,",
    "the constraints on @xmath73 are expected to be quite severe .",
    "the depletion of cmb photons in the patchy magnetic sky and its effect on the cmb anisotropy pattern have been previously considered in  @xcite . however , more stringent limits come from the distortion of the overall blackbody spectrum .    to this end",
    "we use the cobe / firas data for the experimentally measured spectrum , corrected for foregrounds  @xcite .",
    "note that the new calibration of firas  @xcite is within the old errors and would not change any of our conclusions .",
    "the @xmath109 data points @xmath110 at different energies @xmath111 are obtained by summing the best - fit blackbody spectrum to the residuals reported in ref .",
    "the experimental errors @xmath112 and the correlation indices @xmath113 between different energies are also available . in the presence of photon - axion conversion , the original intensity of the `` theoretical blackbody '' at temperature @xmath114 @xmath115^{-1}\\ ] ] would convert to a deformed spectrum that is given by @xmath116 .",
    "we then build the reduced chi - squared function @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the @xmath119-th residual , and @xmath120 is the covariance matrix . we minimize this function with respect to @xmath114 for each point in the parameter space @xmath121 , i.e.  @xmath114 is an empirical parameter determined by the @xmath122 minimization for each @xmath123 rather than being fixed at the standard value @xmath124  k @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show our exclusion contour in the plane of @xmath0 and @xmath73 .",

    ", i.e.  in this region the chance probability to get larger values of @xmath122 is lower than  5% .",
    "we also show the corresponding 99% c.l .",
    "contour which is very close to the 95% contour so that another regression method and/or exclusion criterion would not change the results very much . within a factor of a few",
    ", the same contours also hold if one varies the domain size @xmath50 within a factor  10 .    comparing our exclusion plot with the iso - dimming curves of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we conclude that the entire region @xmath125",
    "@xmath8 is excluded for sn dimming .",
    "a few comments are in order .",
    "intergalactic magnetic fields probably are a relatively recent phenomenon in the cosmic history , arising only at redshifts of a few . as a first approximation we have then considered the photon - axion conversion as happening on present ( @xmath126 ) cmb photons .",
    "since @xmath127 is an increasing function of the photon energy @xmath22 , our approach leads to conservative limits .",
    "moreover , we assumed no correlation between @xmath0 and the intergalactic magnetic field strength .",
    "it is however physically expected that the fields are positively correlated with the plasma density so that relatively high values of @xmath73 should be more likely when @xmath0 is larger .",
    "our constraints in the region of @xmath128  @xmath8 are thus probably tighter than what naively appears .",
    "our limits are nicely complementary to the ones obtained from the effects of photon - axion conversion on quasar colors and spectra  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we superimpose our cmb exclusion contours with the schematic region excluded by quasars . in eq .",
    "( 3 ) of ref .  @xcite that characterizes the random magnetic field direction was correctly taken in the interval 0360@xmath129 whereas in version 2 it was taken in the interval 090@xmath129 ( private communication by the authors ) . ]",
    "the region to the right of the dot - dashed line is excluded by requiring achromaticity of sn  ia dimming  @xcite .",
    "the region inside the dashed lines is excluded by the dispersion in qso spectra . moreover , assuming an intrinsic dispersion of 5% in these spectra , the excluded region could be enlarged up to the dotted lines .",
    "our cmb argument excludes the region above the solid curve at 95% c.l .",
    "a cautionary remark is in order when combining the two constraints . as we have discussed in the previous section ,",
    "our cmb limits on photon - axion conversion are model independent .",
    "conversely , the limits placed by the qso spectra are possibly subjected to loop holes , since they are based on a full correlation between the intergalactic electron density and the magnetic field strength , which is reasonable but not well established observationally .",
    "we have examined the conversion of cmb photons into very low - mass axions in the presence of intergalactic magnetic fields .",
    "the resulting cmb spectral deformation excludes a previously allowed parameter region corresponding to very low densities of the intergalactic medium .",
    "our new limits are complementary to the ones derived from qso dispersion which place serious constraints on the axion - photon conversion mechanism . as a result",
    ", it appears that this mechanism can hardly play a leading role for the apparent sn  ia dimming .",
    "the axion - photon conversion hypothesis has also been advocated to explain trans - gzk cutoff events in ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs )  @xcite . in principle ,",
    "uhecr photons , produced in cosmological sources far away , could drastically reduce energy losses while propagating in the intergalactic medium as axions .",
    "some of these particles would eventually convert back to photons within a few gzk radii , thus justifying the observations of extremely high energy events as well as their isotropy . while one can not rule out the possibility that some uhe `` photon - like '' events at energies @xmath130  ev might be due to this mechanism , our bounds imply that it can play only a subdominant role .",
    "moreover , photons anyway are disfavored as candidates for the majority of the uhecrs .    in summary ,",
    "the cmb constraints together with previous limits suggest that the fascinating mechanism of photon - axion conversion in the intergalactic magnetic fields does not play an important role for either the phenomenon of sn  ia dimming or for uhecr propagation .",
    "a definitive verdict would probably require a common analysis of sn  ia dimming , qso spectra , and the faraday effect of distant radio sources , based on mutually consistent assumptions about the intergalactic matter density and its distribution , the intergalactic @xmath1-field strength and its distribution and correlation with the electron density , and the redshift evolution of these quantities .",
    "our results show that the low-@xmath0 escape route from the qso limits is definitely closed .",
