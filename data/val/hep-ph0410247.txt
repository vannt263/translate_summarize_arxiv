    "primordial black holes ( pbhs ) span a wide range of mass scales and are typically much smaller than the solar mass ( @xmath0 ) and may be formed in the early universe  @xcite .",
    "pbhs may form from the gravitational collapse of large density fluctuations at horizon ( i.e. hubble scale @xmath1 ) crossing in the radiation dominated universe .",
    "a pbh formed at the planck time @xmath2 will have a mass @xmath3 , while masses around @xmath4 are formed at @xmath5 ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "the evaporation time for a pbh mass @xmath4 is nearly the present age of the universe , so pbh with smaller masses than this would have evaporated in the past , unloading a potentially vast amount of entropy .",
    "the success of the standard cosmology and the observation of the cosmic rays severely constrains the abundance of pbhs for various masses and provides useful constraints on inflationary and early universe physics .",
    "for example , big bang nucleosynthesis limits the pbh abundance in the mass range @xmath6 , by limiting the entropy from hawking radiation or requiring that it does not modify the cosmological composition of the light elements  @xcite .",
    "pbh of mass @xmath7 evaporating now will emit particles such as @xmath8-rays which are constrained by observations of the extragalactic @xmath9-ray background which imply @xmath10  @xcite . for @xmath11 , the limit on the pbh abundance is obtained from requiring that @xmath12 does not exceed unity .",
    "these observational constraints on pbhs provide a powerful probe of the primordial fluctuations .",
    "the upper bound on the abundance of pbhs directly leads to that on the density fluctuation at horizon crossing when pbh are formed",
    ". therefore the scales of fluctuations relevant to pbh formation are much smaller than those associated with the cosmic microwave background and the large - scale structure .",
    "this makes studying pbhs important . in the past , for example , constraints on the density perturbation spectrum were obtained by studying pbh formation  @xcite .",
    "while the requirement that pbhs are not over - produced yields useful information about the early universe , pbh can be an interesting dark matter candidate in smaller abundances  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will show that typically pbh are not over - produced during the violent non - equilibrium phase of preheating that follows the end of many inflationary models .",
    "this follows from three key observations : ( 1 ) the peak of the density perturbation spectrum typically lies at scales smaller than the hubble scale .",
    "( 2 ) the peak corresponds to density contrasts of order unity .",
    "( 3 ) the slope of the spectrum around the horizon size is three ( in @xmath13 ) .",
    "putting these together we typically find that at the horizon scale relevant for pbh formation , the density contrast is around an order of magnitude too small to over - produce pbh .",
    "nevertheless , the density perturbation on the horizon scale is significantly enhanced by preheating ( by several orders of magnitude ) compared with the no - resonance case and hence preheating is important in understanding the potential astrophysical and cosmological implications of pbh .    in studying the production of pbhs",
    ", one usually assumes that the probability distribution of density fluctuations at horizon crossing is gaussian .",
    "this assumption is critical because the density perturbations which collapse to black holes are very rare : several @xmath14 fluctuations ( otherwise pbh will be over - produced in all cases ) and therefore production of pbhs is sensitive to the tail of the distribution .",
    "indeed bullock and primack  @xcite found that in some inflation models large perturbations are suppressed relative to a gaussian distribution , resulting in a significant change in a number of pbh .",
    "we study the validity of the gaussian assumption in a later section .    among various possible scenarios that might over - produce pbhs , we focus on preheating after inflation .",
    "preheating is a process in which energy transfer occurs rapidly from inflaton field to another field due to the non - perturbative effects during the oscillating phase of the inflaton  @xcite .",
    "this process significantly differs from the usual reheating scenario , where inflaton decays perturbatively to another particles , in a sense that in preheating most energies of inflaton field converts to created particles only during the several oscillations of inflaton and even the massive particle which is much heavier than the inflaton can be created .",
    "it has been understood that parametric resonance occurs generically at the first stage of reheating  @xcite .",
    "the parametric resonance does not last long because the rapid increase of created particles eventually affect the motion of background field and the created particles scatter off each other , removing the particles from the resonance band .",
    "by these effects , the resonance becomes inefficient and the decaying process of inflaton is described by usual single - body decay theory which finally leads to the thermal equilibrium state  @xcite .",
    "there are many works on preheating .",
    "the first stage of preheating , where the backreaction is negligible and the linear approximation is valid , was studied in detail in  @xcite .",
    "parametric resonance including metric perturbations in order to see the behavior on super horizon scales were studied in  @xcite . as in the case without metric perturbations , there is a crucial difference between the single and multiple field cases .",
    "the analysis of fully non - linear preheating including gravity is very difficult . before now , different approximations such as mean - field approximation  @xcite , lattice simulation  @xcite without metric perturbation and one dimensional fully non - linear calculations  @xcite have been done for studying the various effects caused by preheating on the present universe .",
    "green and malik  @xcite argued that pbhs _ will _ be overproduced due to the amplification of fluctuations during preheating for many parameter regions in a two - field massive inflation model based on the results of  @xcite , which takes into account of the second order fluctuation of @xmath15 field .",
    "put simply , their results suggested that the backreaction timescale was smaller than the timescale for the over - production of pbh .",
    "bassett and tsujikawa  @xcite studied pbh production in the two - field massless inflation model including the effect of backreaction via the hartree - fock approximation and found that pbh overproduction might occur , if the probability distribution of fluctuation at horizon crossing was assumed to be chi - squared ( which lowers the threshold mass variance , @xmath16 ) .",
    "however , they found that pbh were not over - produced if the distribution was assumed to be gaussian _ and _ the density field was smoothed on the scale of the horizon .",
    "nevertheless , that analysis was limited since it neglected the mode - mode coupling effects of rescattering and hence there was an open question both as to the underlying probability distribution of the density fluctuations and the contribution of rescattering to horizon - scale fluctuations .",
    "we address both of these issues in this paper .",
    "we study pbh production due to preheating via two and three - dimensional lattice simulations which automatically include the effects of backreaction and rescatterings .",
    "we modified the c++ code latticeeasy written by felder and trachev  @xcite . in lattice simulations ,",
    "the evolution equations for the scalar fields ( and also the scale factor ) are solved in real ( as opposed to fourier ) space ( @xmath17 for 2 dimensional simulation and @xmath18 for 3 dimensional simulation ) .",
    "metric perturbations were not included , so we can not apply this method to the dynamics on super horizon scales .",
    "we followed the evolution of both the scalar fields and the total density perturbation .",
    "we found that pbh are not overproduced and , interestingly , that the power spectrum at the end of preheating has a universal feature , that is , it is determined by the preheating dynamics and does not depend on the initial conditions .",
    "we also studied the probability distribution of the density perturbation at horizon crossing and found that it remained gaussian which seems to be valid even in the tail of distribution .",
    "a brief summary of our paper is as follows .",
    "section ii gives a brief review of calculating the pbh abundance formed from the large density perturbation .",
    "section iii describes the model of preheating in this simulation . in section iv",
    ", we consider the initial conditions of scalar fields .",
    "section v shows the numerical results of lattice simulation .",
    "we will interpret the non - linear behavior of fluctuations and study the production of pbhs .",
    "section vi discusses the probability distribution of fluctuations at horizon crossing we assume gaussian in usual and section vii is a conclusion .",
    "in this subsection , we briefly review the standard method to estimate the abundance of pbhs  @xcite . in the radiation dominated universe pbhs will be produced if @xmath19 , the amplitude of density perturbations @xmath20 smoothed over the horizon size in the comoving gauge , exceeds a certain threshold @xmath21  @xcite . from linear analysis",
    "the critical value of @xmath22 is roughly estimated to be @xmath23 , but it is not independent of the initial density profile .",
    "numerical study  @xcite suggest @xmath24 for various initial density profiles(see also  @xcite ) .    under the assumption that the probability distribution of density fluctuation at horizon crossing is gaussian ,",
    "the mass fraction of pbhs at the formation time , @xmath25 , is estimated as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the variance of @xmath28 . since the mass fraction of pbhs increases in proportion to the scale factor in the radiation dominated universe",
    ", @xmath29 must be very small in order to satisfy the astrophysical constraints .    roughly speaking",
    ", @xmath29 is observationally constrained to be smaller than about @xmath30 for most of the range of pbh mass except for a small window at @xmath31 g , which corresponds to pbhs evaporating now .",
    "if we adopt @xmath32 as the upper bound on @xmath29 , the upper bound on @xmath14 becomes @xmath33 and @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively , assuming a gaussian distribution for @xmath37 .",
    "though there is uncertainty in @xmath22 it does not affect our conclusions in the range of values @xmath38 .",
    "therefore we adopt the smaller value @xmath39 as the upper bound on @xmath14 to be conservative .",
    "to estimate the variance of density perturbations at the horizon scale , we simply use the power spectrum @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are , respectively , the scale factor and the hubble parameter , and @xmath43 is defined by @xmath44      in this paper , we consider two simple models of preheating .",
    "conformal models are models composed of two scalar field with the potential given by  @xcite , @xmath45 here @xmath46 is the inflaton field .",
    "we start our simulation at the time when @xmath47 drops down to @xmath48 @xcite , where @xmath49 . in the oscillating phase of the inflaton",

    "( [ model91 ] ) and ( [ model92 ] ) proportional to @xmath59 vanish , and thus these equation reduce to the minkowski ones .",
    "this is only exactly true if @xmath47 were conformally coupled to the curvature but since this is a weak effect we neglect it .",
    "the unperturbed background solution for @xmath60 is given by jacobi s elliptic cosine function , @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "then , linearized equations obey the so - called lam equation  @xcite with resonance parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 for @xmath47 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "hence , the growth rate of the longest wavelength mode for @xmath64 is solely determined by @xmath65 , and there is a strong resonance at the longest wavelengths for @xmath66 .",
    "roughly speaking , the largest wave number in the efficient resonant band is @xmath67 an outstanding feature of conformal models is that the modes which are amplified by parametric resonance do not change by cosmic expansion .",
    "the lam equation for @xmath47 also has instability bands , but the growth rate is small compared with the typical one for @xmath64 and limited to roughly the hubble scale @xcite .    in our lattice simulations",
    "the evolution of the scale factor @xmath41 is determined self - consistently by solving friedmann equation with the spatially averaged energy density .",
    "in the simulation , @xmath68 is fixed to @xmath69 appropriate to the cobe normalization .",
    "we studied both @xmath70 and @xmath71 . in both cases",
    "there is parametric resonance of @xmath15 for @xmath72 mode in the linear regime . in the former ,",
    "the @xmath64 background is not strongly suppressed while in the latter case the @xmath64 field is heavy and is strongly suppressed during inflation @xcite .",
    "we also considered massive inflaton models with the potential @xmath73 when the inflaton field oscillates around the potential minimum , the equation of state of the inflaton is dust on average .",
    "this means that amplitude of the background inflaton field decreases as @xmath74 .",
    "therefore it is convenient to introduce rescaled fields as @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "then , until the back reaction due to parametric resonance becomes efficient , the amplitude of the background @xmath77 stays almost constant . in terms of rescaled fields",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath78 where @xmath79 denotes the differentiation with respect to the proper time . from these equations , in contrast to the conformal case , we see that the expansion of the universe affects the motion of scalar fields : the wavelength of each comoving mode is redshifted and the effective coupling between @xmath80 and @xmath81 is decreased .",
    "the linearized equations of eqs .",
    "( [ massive4 ] ) was extensively studied in  @xcite .",
    "the equation for @xmath15 approximately reduces to the so - called mathieu equation and the evolution of @xmath15 field shows broad resonance for @xmath82 huge amplification of @xmath64 occurs at each time when amplitude of the inflaton field becomes zero due to violation of the adiabatic condition @xmath83 for the @xmath64-field frequency , @xmath84 .",
    "when the expansion of the universe is taken into account the parametric resonance shows stochastic behavior because the phase of the @xmath15 field is randomized . despite the stochastic nature , the amplitude of @xmath15 field grows exponentially on average .",
    "the maximum wave number in the resonance band is given by@xcite , @xmath85 in our simulations we adopt @xmath86 indicated by the cobe normalization , and @xmath87 as a representative which realizes strong resonance . with this choice of parameters , we have @xmath88 at the beginning of preheating .",
    "since the modes that our simulation covers are mostly on subhorizon scales , the initial conditions for the field fluctuations after inflation can be determined by the formula for the adiabatic vacuum . for example , for the @xmath64-field we have @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 is the effective mass evaluated at the end of inflation .",
    "recall that we have set @xmath92 at that time .",
    "since we consider the cases with @xmath93 greater than unity ( for @xmath94 ) , the power spectrum of @xmath15 field is given by @xmath95 for wavelengths relevant for parametric resonance .",

    "the dashed line is an appropriately scaled gaussian distribution . at the end of preheating ,",
    "the distribution of large fluctuations is significantly more amplified than the gaussian prediction.,width=264 ]    we first show the distribution of density fluctuation smoothed over the shortest resonant scale in a conformal model .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ sgauss ] .",
    "we can see that the distribution does not trace a gaussian distribution at the end of preheating , while it does at the initial stage .",
    "in particular , the probability of large amplitude of perturbations is enhanced through preheating .",
    "interestingly , the late time distribution looks like exponential .",
    "this results can be understood as follows . at initial stage where the linear approximation is valid ,",
    "density perturbation is just a superposition of gaussian distributions .",
    "hence , the probability distribution is gaussian .",
    "as perturbations grow , the terms quadratic in field perturbations start to contribute to @xmath140 .",
    "the probablity distribution in such situation will be mimiced by a product of two gassian random variables @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "the probability distribution of @xmath195 is given by @xmath196 where @xmath197 and @xmath198 are variances @xmath199 and @xmath200 , respectively . here in the last step we used the steepest decent method assuming @xmath201 is much larger than @xmath202 .",
    "in this manner one can reproduce a pure exponential distribution for large values of @xmath203 .     in the conformal model .",
    "the dotted line is the distribution at the initial time and the black one is at the end of preheating .",
    "contrary to fig .",
    "[ sgauss ] , the distribution is still gaussian even at the end of preheating .",
    "hence , on the horizon scale relevant to pbh production the gaussian assumption is a good approximation.,width=264 ]    next we show the distribution of density perturbations averaged over a large scale .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ lgauss ] . in this case",
    "the distribution is almost gaussian even at the end of preheating .",
    "this result can be interpreted as follows . as we discussed in section v ,",
    "the density perturbations lose correlation on scales much larger than the shortest wavelength in the resonance band .",
    "hence , the average over a large length scale @xmath204 behaves as a sum of a large number of independent random variables of @xmath205 .",
    "therefore its distribution is guaranteed to be close to gaussian by the central limit theorem , which is consistent with numerical the results .",
    "significant deviations from gaussianity are not expected unless the amplitude is as about @xmath206 times larger than the standard deviation .",
    "since the horizon size at the end of preheating is much larger than the shortest wavelength in the resonance band , the required amplitude is extremely large , and hence the probability of finding it is completely negligible .",
    "hence , non - gaussianity can not affect the estimate of the pbh formation rate .",
    "finally we briefly discuss the role of gravitational interactions ( metric perturbations ) which might have effects on pbh formation .",
    "we have neglected them throughout this paper but there is a good reason why one expects that this is a good approximation .",
    "the time scale for gravitational collapse is at most free fall time . unless density perturbations significantly exceed @xmath207 , this time scale is identical to the hubble time scale . on",
    "the other hand parametric resonance undergoes with the time scale determined by the effective mass of the inflation , which is in general shorter than the hubble time scale .",
    "moreover , in the expanding universe gravitational instability does not grow exponentially , while parametric resonance drives exponential growth of perturbations .",
    "hence , we expect gravitational interactions play a subdominant role at the stage of preheating , although later on a longer time scale gravitational collapse may proceed in cases where the effective pressure happens to be very small ( such as in the massive model ) .    in the treatment neglecting the gravitational interaction , there arises another subtlety related to the gauge .",
    "we discussed the amplitude of density perturbations at the horizon size , but it is a gauge dependent quantity .",
    "hence , strictly speaking , it is incorrect to quote the criterion for the pbh formation stated in terms of density perturbations in comoving gauge .",
    "moreover , it is more suitable to use the amplitude of metric perturbations rather than density contrast @xcite .    in the present context",
    ", this is mainly because the power spectrum of density perturbation has a strong @xmath138-dependence , @xmath208 , which means that probability of pbh formation is very sensitive to the choice of the horizon size  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , since the metric perturbations well inside the horizon is characterized by the newton potential , the power spectrum of metric perturbations will be proportional to @xmath209 .",
    "on the other hand , it was shown in  @xcite that the curvature perturbation on the constant energy density hypersurfaces @xmath210 ( bardeen parameter ) behaves like @xmath170 on super horizon scales after preheating by using the separate universe approach  @xcite .",
    "therefore , say , the curvature perturbation @xmath211 will have a peak near at the horizon size , and we will be able to obtain an unambiguous upper limit on the abundance of pbhs produced by preheating . from the above consideration , including metric perturbation in the evolution of scalar fields is an interesting issue which we leave for future work .",
    "we have studied the formation of black holes during preheating after inflation .",
    "preheating provides a challenging framework to illucidate various complex physical processes such as non - equilibrium , non - perturbative field theory in expanding backgrounds .",
    "in addition , since preheating is generic in some regions of parameter space for many inflationary models , the issue of whether primordial black holes ( pbh ) are overproduced is an important one .    to address this",
    "we have performed two and three dimensional lattice simulations of several different inflaton potentials ( conformal and massive ) and parameter regions .",
    "these simulations automatically incorporate all non - linear effects such as backreaction and rescattering of fields .",
    "we found no evidence for over - production of pbh , in contrast to earlier expectations .",
    "in addition we found that although highly non - gaussian on very small scale , the spectrum of density perturbations is effectively gaussain on the horizon ( i.e. hubble ) scale .",
    "our results can be understood simply .",
    "for all cases , we found that when the amplitude of density perturbations at about the shortest wavelength in the resonant band becomes of order unity , the growth due to parametric resonance terminates due to backreaction . at the end of preheating",
    "the final density spectrum is universal , with a blue power spectrum , @xmath212 ( d = 2,3 ) on horizon scales , depending on whether the simulation was two ( @xmath213 ) or three ( @xmath214 ) dimensional .",
    "since the peak of the spectrum is scales significantly shorter than the horizon scale , the amplitude of the density perturbation at the horizon scale extrapolated from the peak is typically about an order of magnitude below the threshold for pbh overproduction .",
    "these results argue for the view that generically pbhs will not be produced so much as to violate astrophysical constraints , even in the case of strong preheating .",
    "this result also applies to the cases with other models and parameters regions if our interpretation of the power spectrum on large scales is universally correct .",
    "the result obtained in this paper is different from the claim by green and malik  @xcite , where they found that pbhs are likely to be overproduced .",
    "they estimated the time when backreaction becomes significant as well as the time when the amplitude of density perturbations exceeds the threshold separately based on linear approximation .",
    "comparison of these two times was used to give a criteria for pbh formation . however , for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite the time when the backreaction becomes significant in the case with @xmath215 and @xmath87 is estimated to be @xmath216 , which is slightly later than our numerical result ( see fig .  [ backreaction ] ) . since the growth of perturbation amplitude is exponential , a small error in the back reaction time can lead to wrong conclusions . in calculating the abundance of produced pbhs , only @xmath217 percent error of backreaction time",
    "can lead to the opposite conclusion .",
    "by contrast , our conclusion is based on self - consistent simulations and rather robust qualitative observations .",
    "there is no delicate comparison of different time scales .    in this paper , we considered standard slow roll inflation . in such cases , preheating occurs at rather high energies .",
    "therefore the mass of pbhs formed in the present context is too small to avoid evaporation before the big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "hence , those pbhs are not subject to any observational constraint even if pbhs are produced abundantly , unless pbhs leave planck mass relics  @xcite .",
    "( hence we have assumed that pbh will leave planck mass relic throughout this paper . )",
    "even if relics are formed , the constraint on the mass fraction of produced black holes is @xmath218  @xcite , we can therefore conclude that production of pbhs by preheating does not give a serious constraint on such simple models of preheating as discussed in this paper .",
    "however , our qualitative results will also apply for preheating at lower energies .",
    "let us consider the possibility of making more massive black holes by preheating , say , in the case of massive inflaton models .",
    "now we consider to vary the inflaton mass @xmath100 and the value of @xmath47-filed at the beginning of preheating @xmath219 within @xmath220 ( as an example of realizing small value of @xmath219 , we can consider the hybrid inflation model  @xcite . ) .",
    "the key quantity is the ratio of @xmath221 given in ( [ con4 ] ) to the hubble parameter , which is estimated as @xmath222 this ratio is independent of @xmath100 and is the smallest for @xmath223 .",
    "then the same estimate given in ( [ remass7 ] ) applies as an upper bound for @xmath28 . on the other hand ,",
    "lowering @xmath224 down to @xmath225 only change the upper bound on @xmath16 from 0.031 to 0.026 .",
    "thus we can say that overproduction of more massive pbhs due to parametric resonance is also unlikely .",
    "we have also confirmed gaussianity of the probability distribution of density perturbations at the horizon scale , which is assumed in the estimate of the production rate of pbhs .",
    "the appearance of gaussianity is in accordance with the interpretation of the spectrum on large scales .",
    "if perturbations become uncorrelated beyond the shortest resonant scale , perturbations at the horizon scale are given by average of many statistically independent random variables .",
    "thus gaussianity naturally follows from the central limit theorem .",
