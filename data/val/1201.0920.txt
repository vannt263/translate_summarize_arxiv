    "after theoretical prediction @xcite and experimental detection @xcite of josephson tunneling between two superconductors separated by a thick insulator under application of an external voltage , analogous quantum oscillations were found also in a superfluid system : two vessels of superfluid helium connected by a nanoscale aperture @xcite .",
    "similar type of dynamics was observed for two weakly coupled atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) created in a double - trap potential .",
    "differently from superconductors and superfluid helium in josephson effect for atomic becs inter - particle interactions play essential role @xcite .",
    "an an - harmonic behavior occurs in these systems additionally to common josephson oscillations . under certain initial conditions",
    "becs localize in one of the traps formed by external potential due to suppression of the tunneling current @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon is known as macroscopic quantum self - trapping ( mqst ) .",
    "it is a consequence of domination of nonlinearities , e.g. interactions , over josephson coupling in the system . in some other range of the initial conditions delocalized",
    "phase is formed with unsuppressed oscillations between the traps .    in general ,",
    "such a system - interacting becs in a josephson junction ( jj ) is described by well - known hamiltonian @xmath0 written in terms of population imbalance @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are populations in trap one and trap two , and phase difference @xmath4 between becs .",
    "two - mode approximation including only lowest energy states of symmetric double - trap is used in hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian1 ] ) @xcite and contains single parameter @xmath5 . in the last expression",
    "@xmath6 figures as josephson coupling constant which is equal to the difference in energies of symmetric and anti - symmetric states of the double - trap potential is less then zero , as the symmetric state is usually lower in energy then the anti - symmetric one .",
    "@xmath7 is total population of particles in both traps which interact with energy @xmath8 .    inspecting the phase - space diagram ( @xmath9,@xmath10 ) of hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian1 ] ) one can observe two distinct regions separated by separatrix line @xmath11 ( full / red contour in fig . [ contour ] ) .",
    "fixing the value of @xmath12 in ( [ hamiltonian1 ] ) by choosing initial conditions @xmath13 and @xmath14 , delocalized regime will establish if @xmath15 .",
    "it is characterized by the population imbalance being zero in average ( @xmath16 ) for the system s cyclic motion on closed orbits ( see fig .",
    "[ contour ] ) . approaching the separatrix from the inner side",
    "the orbits starts to deviate from regular circles as nonlinearities start to be important .",

    "contour lines for @xmath12=0,1,2 and 3 are labeled .",
    "separatrix is shown with full / red line ]    besides cold atoms there is an another kind of particles which can undergo a transition into collective state with properties similar to bose- einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "these are exciton - polaritons whose condensation has been repported several years ago in in cdte microcavities @xcite at about 20 k and later on in gan - based microcavities even at room - temperatures @xcite .",
    "the possibility to obtain bec at such conditions is extremely interesting from fundamantal point of view .",
    "besides , it opens a way for design of novel optoelectronic components , such as polariton lasers @xcite and various devices based on polariton superfluidity @xcite    polaritons are two - dimensional quasi - particles appearing due to strong coupling of excitons in semiconductor quantum - well(s ) and photons confined within a microcavity structure .",
    "peculiar properties of exciton - polaritons are consequences of their hybrid , half - light half - mater nature coming from photonic and excitonic components respectively . in particular , ultra - small effective mass of polaritons , which is typically four or five orders of magnitude less then the free electron mass , makes quantum collective phenomena very pronounced in polaritonic systems and leads extremely high critical temperatures of the polariton bec transition .    for the purposes of our further discussion ,",
    "another property of polaritons is very important .",
    "that is projection of total angular momentum @xmath19 of a polariton state on the structure s growth axis ( chosen as @xmath9 direction ) @xcite . it can take two values : @xmath20 corresponding to mixing of bright excitons ( @xmath21 ) and photons with right or left circular polarizations .",
    "dark excitons with @xmath22 are uncoupled from cavity mode due to optical selection rules and thus do not contribute to the formation of a polariton doublet .",
    "from the point of view os spin polariton is thus analogical to electron , as both of them are two - level systems .",
    "consequently one can apply pseudospin formalism for description of spin dynamics of the polaritons .",
    "it is convenient to represent a pseudo spin state of polariton system by a point on poincar sphere ( also known as bloch sphere ) .",
    "importantly , polariton pseudospin unambiguously defines the polarization state of photoemission from the cavity .",
    "the states lying at the poles of poincar sphere will correspond to circular polarization of the polaritons , the states on equator- to linear polarizations and all other states to elliptical polarizations .    being bosons , exciton - polaritons should manifest phenomena related to josephson effect .",
    "polaritonic josephson junctions ( pjj ) were considered theoretically in refs . @xcite and experimentally in ref.@xcite . in these articles",
    "polariton pseudospin was neglected , and and josephson coupling occurred between the polaritons located in spatially separated traps .",
    "the introduction of polarization degree of freedom makes josephson dynamics far more rich .",
    "indeed , in addition to the coupling between states localized in different traps , two polarization states in single asymmetric trap can be coupled as well by mechanism analogical to te- tm splitting @xcite .",
    "josephson - type oscillations can occur between different polarizations , the phenomenon which was called intristic josephson effect @xcite .",
    "the interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic josephson dynamics can lead to dynamic separation of different polarizations in the real space and other intriguing phenomena @xcite .",
    "the role of the polarization coupling in pjj was studied for several configurations @xcite . in most of them",
    "so called two - mode approximation was applied , in which only two lowest levels , one in each of two traps , were considered .",
    "an exception is the reference @xcite where several modes were included in analysis in order damping of josephson oscillations due to the interactions of the polaritons with acoustic phonons .",
    "however , even in this case the separation between two fundamental modes and excited ones was considered to be much greater then characteristic values of blueshifts provided by polariton- polariton interactions , and transitions to the excited modes were only possible due to absorbtion of phonons .    in this paper",
    "we analyze multimode pjj with confining potential created in such a way that interactions between the lowest and excited levels are not negligible .",
    "this kind of coupling have been already considered for josephson junctions based on atomic becs @xcite .",
    "our goal is to extend the analysis of ref.@xcite for the case of cavity polaritons accounting the polarization degree of freedom , and clarify the effects of the coupling between fundamental and excited modes on nonlinear polarization dynamics of pjjs .",
    "in ref.@xcite keldysh - green functions technique was employed to study dynamics for atomic josephson junction with multimode structure . here",
    "we shall follow similar approach for description of pjjs accounting for the spin degree of freedom .",
    "because of spinor nature of polariton condensate in addition to normal josephson coupling we have to consider also and the coupling of two polarization components , normally irrelevant for atomic jjs .",
    "we start by expanding exciton - polariton field operators @xmath23 over complete set of eigenstates @xmath24 of a double - well potential @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote annihilation operators for two lowest modes of pjj localized in the traps one and two , and @xmath28 stands for the anihilation operator on excited level @xmath29 taking values .",
    "@xmath30 denotes circular polarization of the state .",
    "the system we study is described by the hamiltonian which can be represented as a sum of three terms : @xmath31    the terms conserving z- projection of pseudospin @xmath32 and @xmath33 denoted by @xmath34 and @xmath35 are given by following expressions @xmath36 the effective mass of polaroton is denoted by @xmath37 and @xmath38 stands for external double - well potential .",

    "for freely oscillating component the presence of the reservoir - assisted term leads to self - trapping .",
    "this transition is provided by competition of two effects : common josephson tunneling @xmath6 and reservoir - assisted coupling given by @xmath53 . as their signs are opposite ( @xmath118 and @xmath119 ) , increase of @xmath53 decrease in fact absolute value of the total josephson coupling .",
    "this results in overwhelming of free oscillations by nonlinearities and establishing of mqst in the minor polarization component .",
    "the smaller is the total josephson coupling the trapping becomes stronger ( compare blue and red line of the upper panel ) .",
    "the dominant component rests relatively robust to the influence of the reservoir - assisted coupling .",
    "note , that in hypothetical case of positive @xmath6 the result will be opposite to those considered here : the reservoir- assisting terms will increase the absolute value of the effective tunneling constant , thus contributing to the distruction of mqst regime for major polarization component .",
    "in conclusion , we analyzed polarization dynamics in multimode polartonic josephson junctions .",
    "we have found that the coupling between fundamental and excited modes changes the patterns of intrinsic and extrinsic josephson oscillations , leading to the appearance of higher harmonics and transitions between josephson and mqst regimes .",
