    "the planck s constant @xmath1 plays a central role in quantum mechanics .",
    "it was first introduced in 1900 by max planck in his study on the blackbody radiation  @xcite as the proportionality constant between the minimal increment of energy of a charged oscillator in a cavity hosting blackbody radiation and the frequency of its associated electromagnetic wave . in 1905",
    "albert einstein explained the photoelectric effect postulating that luminous energy can be absorbed or emitted only in discrete amounts , called quanta  @xcite .",
    "the light quantum behaved as an electrically neutral particle and was called `` photon '' .",
    "the planck - einstein relation , @xmath5 , connects the photon energy with its associated wave frequency .",
    "nowadays , the measurement of the planck s constant is ordinarily performed by physics students in many educational laboratories , both in universities and in high schools .",
    "the most common techniques exploit the blackbody radiation ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the emission of light by leds when a forward bias is applied ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) or the photoelectric effect ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "almost all measurements of @xmath1 exploiting the photoelectric effect are based on the principle of the experiment carried out by millikan in the years from 1912 to 1915  @xcite .",
    "it is worth here to point out that , although the title of his 1916 article is `` a direct photoelectric determination of planck s @xmath1 '' , in his experiment millikan could not measure @xmath1 , but he measured the ratio @xmath0 between the planck s constant and the electron charge ; then , using the value of @xmath2 that he had previously measured  @xcite , he was able to evaluate @xmath1.[multiblock footnote omitted ]    although the apparatus used by millikan was rather complex , the method chosen for the measurement of @xmath0 is quite simple .",
    "the detectors basically consisted of a metal surface , which was illuminated with different monochromatic light sources , and a collector electrode , kept at a lower potential with respect to the metal .",
    "for each frequency of the incident light , the potential was adjusted until no current flowed through the collector , thus allowing to evaluate the `` stopping potential '' .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the stopping potential increases linearly with the frequency of the incident light , and the slope of the straight line is given by @xmath0 .",
    "a linear fit of the stopping potentials at different frequencies allows therefore to evaluate planck s constant if the value of the electric unit charge @xmath2 is known .    in the various didactic experiments proposed to measure the ratio @xmath0 exploiting photoelectric effect ,",
    "a variety of devices and light sources are used ( see again the examples in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we present a novel didactic experience for measuring @xmath0 using a photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) and a set of light emitting diodes ( leds ) .",
    "we propose this experience to undergraduate physics students attending our introductory laboratory course to quantum physics .",
    "pmts are very common devices in atomic and nuclear physics , and can be easily available in a didactic laboratory .",
    "the main advantage of a pmt with respect to a conventional photoelectric cell resides in the fact that photoelectrons extracted at the cathode are considerably amplified ( the typical gain is of @xmath6 ) , thus providing detectable output currents even when a large fraction of them is repelled back to the photocathode .",
    "this feature will help in evaluating the stopping potential as we will discuss later in sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : setup ] we describe the instrumentation and the theoretical principles of the measurement ; in sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] we propose a method to analyze the data collected in the experiment ; finally in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we discuss the results obtained and some possible strategies to improve the experiment .",
    "pmts are widely used in many fields of physics to convert an incident flux of light into an electric signal .",
    "a pmt is a vacuum tube consisting of a photocathode and an electron multiplier , composed by a set of electrodes called `` dynodes '' at increasing potentials .",
    "incident light enters into the tube through the photocathode , and the electrons are extracted as a consequence of photoelectric effect ( photoelectrons ) .",
    "photoelectrons are accelerated by an appropriate electric field towards the first dynode of the multiplier , where a few secondary electrons are extracted .",
    "the multiplication process is repeated through all the dynodes , until the electrons ejected from the last dynode are finally collected by the anode , which produces the current signal that can be read out .",
    "a pmt can be operated either in pulsed mode or with a continuous light flux .",
    "in our experience we used a philips xp 2008 pmt  @xcite .",
    "the photocathode is a thin film ( a few @xmath7 thick ) made of a sb - cs alloy deposited over a glass window , and is sensitive to a range of wavelengths that extends from approximately @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "the upper limit of this interval is set by the work function of the metal alloy , while the lower limit is set by the glass of the window , which is opaque to uv photons .",
    "the photocathode works in transmission mode , i.e. photoelectrons are collected from the opposite side of incident light .",
    "the electron multiplier consists of a set of @xmath10 dynodes , each made of a be - cu alloy .    ,",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 . the resistance @xmath13 of the potentiometer connecting the cathode with the first dynode is allowed to vary in the range @xmath14\\units{k\\omega}$ ] .",
    "the capacitors in the last stages are used to keep the voltage differences stable , and their capacitance is @xmath15 . ]",
    "[ fig : divider ] shows the electric scheme of the voltage divider used to provide the voltage differences to the dynodes . unlike a standard pmt voltage divider , here",
    "the negative high voltage is supplied to the first dynode ( not to the photocathode , which is grounded through the resistor @xmath16 ) , thus ensuring that the photocathode k is kept at higher voltage with respect to the first dynode dy1 .",
    "the voltage difference between the two electrodes can be adjusted by changing the variable resistance @xmath13 , and is given by :    @xmath17    in writing eq .",
    "[ eq : vkd ] we took into account the fact that @xmath18 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : divider ] ) . if a high voltage @xmath19 is supplied to the pmt , a maximum voltage difference of @xmath20 can be applied between k and dy1 . since @xmath21",
    ", photoelectrons extracted from k will be slowed down in their motion towards dy1 and eventually sent back to k. on the other hand , like in standard pmt voltage dividers , the dynodes and the anode are kept at increasing potentials ( if @xmath19 , the average voltage differences between each pair of dynodes will be of the order of @xmath22 ) . in this way ,",
    "photoelectrons eventually reaching dy1 will be multiplied , producing a detectable current signal at the anode a , and consequently a voltage difference across the load resistor @xmath23 .",
    ".main features of the emission spectra of the leds used in the measurement .",
    "the wavelength and frequency spectra @xmath24 have been fitted with gaussian functions . here",
    "we report the mean values and , in brackets , the standard deviations of each fit function . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to perform our measurements we used five leds , emitting visible light of different colors ranging from red to violet .",
    "we preliminarily measured their emission spectra using an ocean optics hr2000 + spectrometer  @xcite .",

    "the emission spectra of each led have been fitted with gaussian functions .",
    "the values of the peak wavelengths ( frequencies ) and the corresponding standard deviations are reported in tab .",
    "[ tab : led ] .",
    "[ fig : setup ] shows the experimental setup .",
    "the photocathode window is coupled to a plastic support with a hole drilled at its center where the different leds can be inserted .",
    "the pmt and the support are wrapped with black tape , to prevent external light entering into the device .",
    "the hole is also covered with black tape when a led is inserted to perform a measurement .",
    "the voltage differences between k and dy1 and across the load resistor @xmath23 are measured by two digital multimeters .",
    "the knob placed on the left of the pmt is connected to a potentiometer which allows the user to adjust the value of @xmath13 and consequently the voltage @xmath25 .",
    "the high voltage is supplied to the pmt by means of a caen n471a nim power supply module  @xcite ( not shown in the figure ) . in our measurements we operated the pmt with high voltages in the range @xmath26 .",
    "this choice allows to keep a high pmt gain without incurring saturation effects due to large number of electrons flowing across the last dynodes .",
    "the students should investigate the dependence of the voltage difference @xmath27 across the load resistor on the retarding potential @xmath28 for the various leds .",
    "the value of @xmath27 is proportional to the anode current and consequently to the rate of photoelectrons collected by dy1 . during a measurement , the voltage across the led",
    "must be kept constant , thus ensuring that the intensity of the light entering the pmt is also constant .",
    "photoelectrons extracted from the photocathode will have different initial kinetic energies up to a maximum value given by :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the energy of incident photons and @xmath4 is the work function of the photocathode . if @xmath31 , all the photoelectrons extracted from k will be able to reach dy1 , and a current will flow through @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath32 is increased , only the more energetic photoelectrons will be collected by dy1 and therefore the output current will decrease . when @xmath33 the photoelectrons will not be allowed to reach dy1 and the current flowing through @xmath23 is expected to vanish .",
    "the value    @xmath34    represents the stopping potential , that depends on the energy of incident photons and on the work function of the photocathode .    from the plots of @xmath27 as a function of @xmath35 ( hereafter we will refer to these plots as `` photoelectric curves '' ) , the students will be able to evaluate the stopping potential @xmath35 for each led .",

    "[ fig : photocurves ] shows some examples of photoelectric curves obtained when the pmt is illuminated with the various leds .",
    "as expected , the value of @xmath27 decreases with increasing @xmath32 , but never drops to zero .",
    "this behavior can be explained by taking into account that a fraction of the incident photons can pass through the photocathode without interacting , and can extract photoelectrons from the first dynode .",
    "these electrons are accelerated towards dy2 , thus contributing to the output signal because of the high pmt gain .",
    "hence , even when @xmath39 , a background current will flow through the load resistor @xmath23 , and consequently a steady positive value of @xmath27 will be measured .",
    "the fraction of photons extracting photoelectrons from the first dynode changes with the photon energy , as the absorption probabilities in the photocathode and in the first dynode are strongly dependent on the photon energy .",
    "another possible contribution to the background anode current could be due to ambient light entering into the device , but we ruled out this contribution performing a preliminary set of measurements with the leds being turned off , in which we observed @xmath41 for any value of @xmath32 .",
    "finally , it is also worth to point out here that the electron optics of a pmt is designed for electrodes kept at increasing potentials . therefore electrons emitted from the photocathode are accelerated towards the first dynode and are focused onto its center regardless their emission angle , thus ensuring optimal collection efficiency . setting in our device a retarding potential between k and dy1",
    ", we introduce a distortion in the electron optics of the pmt , that affects the trajectories of photoelectrons preventing them to reach the first dynode .",
    "however , even when @xmath39 , some photoelectrons travelling in weaker field regions might be able to reach the first dynode , contributing to the output signal .",
    "we performed several sets of measurements , changing either the high voltage @xmath42 supplied to the pmt or the intensity of the light emitted by the various leds .",
    "an increase of @xmath42 will result in an increase of the gain of the electron multiplier , while an increase of the light intensity will result in an increase of the number of photoelectrons .",
    "in particular , we observe that , if the light intensity is kept constant and @xmath42 is changed , the shape of the photoelectric curves does not change , but the values of @xmath27 corresponding to a given @xmath32 increase with increasing @xmath42 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath42 is kept constant and the light intensity is changed , the shape of the photoelectric curves does not change , but the values of @xmath27 increase with increasing light intensity .",
    "this behavior is observed for a wide range of high voltages ( @xmath43 ) and led intensities ( here the range depends on the color of the leds ) .",
    "however , if the voltage across the load resistor becomes too large ( @xmath44 ) , saturation effects might occur due to the large number of electrons moving across the last dynodes because the capacitors in the last stages of the voltage divider could not be able to keep the voltage differences stable .",
    "another feature of the photoelectric curves shown in fig .  [ fig : photocurves ] is that the transition between the regime in which photoelectrons emitted from k are collected by dy1 and the regime in which photoelectrons are repelled is not sharp , i.e. the slope of the photoelectric curve changes smoothly with @xmath32 , thus making the determination of @xmath35 not straightforward .",
    "this behavior is due to the spread in the photoelectron kinetic energies when they are emitted from the photocathode .",
    "it is also worth to point out here that , since photons emitted by leds are not monochromatic ( as shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : led ] the widths of the frequency spectra are @xmath45 of the corresponding peak values ) , the photoelectric curves can not be described in terms of a single value of the stopping potential , but it would be more appropriate to take into account the dependence of the stopping potential on the frequency .",
    "hereafter we will neglect this depencence and we will assume that each photoelectric curve can be described in terms of the stopping potential @xmath35 corresponding to the peak frequency of the led .",
    "the determination of either an analytical or a numerical model of the photoelectric curves would be rather complex and perhaps would go beyond the scope of an introductory laboratory course for undergraduate students .",
    "therefore , to analyze the data collected by the students carrying out the experiment , we developed a phenomenological approach .",
    "after the analysis of many photoelectric curves obtained in different conditions ( different led intensities and different pmt high voltages ) , we noticed that the asymptotic behavior of all photoelectric curves can be adequately described by the following functions :    @xmath46    for each photoelectric curve we select two sets of points , belonging to the regions @xmath47 and @xmath39 , and we fit these points with the functions in eq .",
    "[ eq : fit ] , thus determining the parameters @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the fits are performed using the free data analysis software root  @xcite , provided by cern .",
    "we then define the value of the stopping potential @xmath35 as the abscissa of the intersection point of the two curves , which can be evaluated solving the following non - linear equation :    @xmath53    the previous equation , which gives @xmath35 as a function of the parameters @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , can not be solved analytically , but can be easily solved in a numerical way , for instance using the bisection method .",
    "this procedure is graphically illustrated in the plots of fig .",
    "[ fig : photocurves ] , where we superimposed to each photoelectric curve the functions obtained from the two fits , also showing the position of the intersection between the two curves . as we anticipated in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , it is worth to point out here that the detection of a significant steady background current instead of a slowly vanishing current helps to better define the stopping potential .    to evaluate the error on @xmath35 we use the standard error propagation formula , starting from the errors on @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which are computed by the root software when performing the fits .",
    "however , since @xmath35 is an implicit function of the parameters , a numerical approach is also needed to evaluate its partial derivatives with respect to the various parameters . for instance , to evaluate the partial derivative @xmath54 , we start from the set of fitted parameters and we change @xmath48 into @xmath55 ; must be fulfilled , and therefore one must choose @xmath56 such that @xmath57 . ]",
    "then we solve eq .",
    "[ eq : vsfit ] with the value of @xmath58 , obtaining a new solution @xmath59 and finally we evaluate the partial derivative as @xmath60 , where @xmath61 . in the same way we calculate the partial derivatives of @xmath35 with respect to the other parameters .",
    ", while the vertical error bars represent the uncertainties on the stopping potentials , evaluated as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] .",
    "the points are well fitted with a straight line .",
    "the fit results are summarized in the top panel ( the parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 are respectively the intercept the slope ) , where the @xmath40 of the fit is also shown . ]",

    "[ eq : vs ] , the slope of the line corresponds to @xmath0 , while its intercept corresponds to @xmath3 .",

    "[ fig : stoppingpotentials ] yields for the planck s constant a value @xmath66 and for the work function of the photocathode a value @xmath67 .",
    "the measurement of @xmath0 proposed in the present paper yields an uncertainty of about @xmath68 on the value of @xmath0 and an uncertainty larger than @xmath69 on @xmath3 .",
    "the main sources of error are the spreads on the led frequencies and the uncertainties on the values of the stopping potentials . to mitigate the effects of the frequency spreads",
    ", one could use monochromatic light sources coupling the leds to appropriate filters , or even using laser sources .",
