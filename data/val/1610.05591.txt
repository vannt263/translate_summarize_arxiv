    "strictly speaking a dibaryon denotes just any object with baryon number b = 2 . in this sense",
    "the first known dibaryon has been the deuteron discovered in 1932 by urey , brickwedde and murphy @xcite . in terms of quarks",
    "a dibaryon is composed of six valence quarks  or more generally speaking the number of quarks minus the number of antiquarks has to be six .",
    "it may be of molecular type , _",
    "i.e. _ spatially extended with two well separated interacting quark bags as is the case for the well - known deuteron . or  more exotic and hence more interesting  a dibaryon could be a spatially compact hexaquark object , where all six quarks sit in a single quark bag .",
    "the long history of dibaryon searches dating back to the fifties has been a very changeful one with many ups and downs .",
    "early predictions of a vast number of dibaryon states initiated endless experimental claims , but finally none survived careful experimental investigations . for a review about this dibaryon rush era , which lasted until the eighties , see , _",

    "despite their long painful history dibaryon searches have recently received renewed interest , in particular by the recognition that there are more complex quark configurations than just the familiar @xmath0 and @xmath1 systems  in favor also of hidden - color aspects @xcite . recently",
    "two groups announced that lattice qcd calculations @xcite provide evidence for a bound @xmath2-dibaryon  as predicted by jaffe @xcite already in 1977 .",
    "nevertheless any experimental evidence for it is still pending despite the manyfold experimental efforts @xcite .",
    "recently the wasa - at - cosy collaboration has found that the double - pionic fusion reaction @xmath3 proceeds dominantly via a resonance structure observed in the total cross section at @xmath4 = 2.37 gev with @xmath5 70 mev and @xmath6 @xcite  after first signs of it had been observed already at uppsala by the celsius / wasa collaboration @xcite .",
    "meanwhile nearly all possible decay channels have been investigated @xcite , in particular also the one into the elastic @xmath7 channel . and new data on polarized @xmath7 scattering in the region of interest exhibit a resonance pole in the coupled @xmath8 partial waves in accordance with the resonance hypothesis @xcite .",
    "this gives the first solid evidence for the existence of a non - trivial , possibly extraordinary dibaryon .",
    "since the measurements suggest this resonance to decay dominantly via an intermediate @xmath9 system , it constitutes asymptotically a @xmath9 system bound by nearly 100 mev - as predicted by dyson and xuong @xcite already in 1964 and later - on also by goldman _",
    "@xcite , who called it the `` inevitable dibaryon '' @xmath10 due to its unique symmetry features .",
    "most recent relativistic three - body calculations based on hadron dynamics @xcite as well as quark model calculations @xcite succeeded to predict properly a number of characteristics of this resonance . the latter also postulate a substantial hidden - color component accounting in particular for the unusually narrow width of this resonance .    in the following",
    "we present a historical review about dibaryon predictions as well as experimental dibaryon searches .",
    "we start with some basics of the baryon - baryon system , before we enter the early days of dibaryon initiatives .",
    "then we consider the dibaryon rush era initiated by jaffe s prediction of the @xmath2 dibaryon , a bound @xmath11 system . the deplorable experience with unjustified claims of dibaryon discoveries due to statistically poor , inclusive and/or kinematically incomplete measurements led in the nineties on the one hand to a big frustration about this subject , but on the other hand also to a restart of dedicated exclusive and kinematically complete high - statistics measurements , which will be the topic of the second part of this review and which finally lead to the first solid evidence for a non - trivial dibaryon resonance .",
    "finally we give an outlook on future activities in this field .    in the following",
    "we will adopt the convention of the particle data group @xcite and quote masses for simplicity in mev instead of mev / c@xmath12 .",
    "also , angular momenta between baryons are denoted by capital letters , otherwise by small letters .",
    "naturally the quest for dibaryons concentrated first on the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath13 ) system , before later - on also the strangeness sector was explored .        as mentioned already in the introduction ,",
    "formally the oldest known dibaryon is the deuteron . and",
    "until recently it has been the only safely discovered dibaryon at all .    since its discovery in 1932 by urey , brickwedde and murphy @xcite in the atomic spectrum of hydrogen gas in a discharge tube , the spectroscopic quantities of the deuteron like mass , charge , spin - parity , dipole and quadrupole moments as well as form factors and structure functions have been measured with high precision .",
    "the deuteron is a very loosely bound object with a binding energy of only 2.2 mev or 1.1 mev / a  which has to be compared to the average binding energy of about 8 mev / a in nuclei .",
    "accordingly it possesses a very large charge radius of 2.1 fm @xcite , _ i.e. _ the centers of proton and neutron are on the average further apart from each other then the range of the pion exchange @xmath14 1.4 fm , which constitutes the longest range hadronic interaction in the @xmath13 system .    due to this large internucleon distance",
    "the pion exchange is the by far dominating interaction , which completely describes the asymptotic behavior of the deuteron .",
    "hence the pioneering simple model descriptions of hulthen @xcite and reid @xcite have been already very successful in properly accounting for the asymptotic behavior of the deuteron wavefunction . only at short distances in the neutron - proton overlap region",
    "the situation is not yet fully understood .",
    "in particular it is still an unsolved problem , how much of a hexaquark configuration within a compact six - quark bag is present in the deuteron .",
    "whereas early theoretical work @xcite on that claimed up to 1.5@xmath15 six - quark content in the deuteron , more recent evaluations see this number near 0.15 - 0.30 @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "however , a recent dressed bag model calculation arrives again at 2 - 3 @xmath15 @xcite .    for the @xmath9 component in the deuteron",
    "there exists an experimental upper limit of 0.4 @xmath15 at the 90 @xmath15 confidence level from neutrino - deuteron interaction studies @xcite .",
    "theoretical estimates give contributions of the same order @xcite .",
    "the question , whether a stable diproton , _",
    "i.e. _ a stable @xmath16 nucleus exists , may be solved easily by mass spectrometer measurements . with regard to the dineutron",
    "the experimental situation is not quite as easy , since it has no charge and hence also no atomic shell , which could reveal its existence or non - existence .",
    "however , we know the answer to both questions from nn scattering experiments and successive partial - wave analyses . of particular interest in this respect are the @xmath17 partial waves @xmath18 and @xmath19 with isospin 1 and 0 , respectively , most importantly their scattering lengths . if the scattering length is negative , then we have an attractive interaction , which however is not strong enough to create a @xmath13 boundstate . only , if the scattering length is positive and larger than the effective range of the interaction , then the @xmath13 system possesses an boundstate in this particular partial wave .    for the scattering length in the isoscalar @xmath19 partial wave , which occurs only in the @xmath7 system ,",
    "a value of @xmath20 + 5 fm @xcite has been obtained experimentally , _",
    "i.e. _ this system has a boundstate , the well - known deuteron boundstate .    for the scattering length of the isovector @xmath18 partial wave",
    "the experimental results are @xmath20 -18 fm in case of @xmath21 @xcite and @xmath22 @xcite scattering and -24 fm in case of @xmath7 scattering @xcite  the difference being due to charge symmetry breaking .",
    "these results tell us that there is * no * boundstate in @xmath21 and @xmath22 systems .      though the @xmath13 interaction in the isovector @xmath18 channel is too weak to produce a boundstate , it is strong enough to create at least a virtual state being unbound by merely 66 kev @xcite . in nuclear reactions experiments this state",
    "is sensed as a final state interaction ( fsi ) between emitted nucleons @xcite .",
    "there it shows up as a low - mass enhancement in @xmath13 invariant - mass distributions  as depicted _",
    "e.g. _ in fig .",
    "[ fig - nnpi ] .      for the hyperon - nucleon system",
    "there is naturally much less information available from experimental side , since hyperons are not stable . for the most long - lived hyperon , the only weakly decaying @xmath23",
    ", some kind of secondary beam may be obtained from @xmath24 production processes in nuclear targets , but this is still of very limited statistics and precision .",
    "most information about the interaction between @xmath26 and @xmath24 may be obtained by considering the final - state interaction between both particles in production processes like @xmath27 . there",
    "it shows up as an enhancement at the low - mass threshold in the @xmath28 invariant - mass distributions  similar to the case of the @xmath13 fsi .",
    "for an example see fig .",
    "[ fig - tof ] , where the @xmath28 fsi is clearly seen as a strong enhancement at the @xmath29 threshold . from analyses of the fsi enhancement and of the limited data on elastic @xmath30 scattering a spin - averaged scattering length of @xmath31 -2 fm has been deduced .    from precision measurements of this reaction with polarized beam it has been possible recently to resolve the spin - dependence of the scattering length and to extract model - independently the spin - triplet scattering length as @xmath32  fm @xcite , which agrees with @xmath33 fm from @xmath34 elastic scattering @xcite .",
    "for the spin - singlet scattering length a value of @xmath35 fm has been deduced @xcite .",
    "these results are in agreement with model predictions based on meson exchange @xcite and chiral effective field theory @xcite .",
    "the experimental results mean that the @xmath28 interaction is attractive , but substantially less attractive than the @xmath13 interaction , so that no boundstate can be formed , _",
    "i.e. _ , in particular there is no `` strange '' deuteron .",
    "the @xmath37 interaction can be studied by hyperon - production reactions of the type @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "both reactions have been studied in exclusive and kinematically complete measurements at cosy - tof @xcite .",
    "no sign of a significant @xmath40 fsi has been observed .",
    "this means that the @xmath37 interaction must be substantially weaker than the @xmath28 interaction .      in heavy - ion collisions @xmath24 particles",
    "are produced abundantly , so that also the @xmath42 fsi can be looked at . in measurements of au - au collisions with the star detector at",
    "rhic the @xmath11 correlation function has been obtained @xcite .",
    "whereas in a first analysis a slightly repulsive interaction has been deduced , an improved analysis obtains a scattering length of @xmath43 @xcite , which still would exclude a boundstate in the @xmath11 system .",
    "however , if in this analysis so - called feed - down corrections are included , the limits relax to @xmath44 -1.2 fm , which does not completely rule out a boundstate  see the discussion about the @xmath2 dibaryon in sect .",
    "summarizing , in the baryon - baryon ( @xmath45 ) system we have so far clear - cut experimental evidence only for a single boundstate , which is the deuteron groundstate known since 1932 . in particular , there is no boundstate in the hyperon - nucleon system with strangeness @xmath46 = -1 . in the strangeness @xmath46",
    "= -2 sector the existence of a possible boundstate , the @xmath2 dibaryon , has not yet been ruled out completely at present .",
    "the question , whether there are more eigenstates in the system of two baryons than just the @xmath19 deuteron groundstate and the virtual @xmath18 state , has been around in principle since the discovery of the deuteron in 1932 .",
    "it became clear pretty soon that the loosely bound deuteron would not have any excited bound states .",
    "hence the search for resonances focused soon on nucleon - nucleon collision energies close to the pion - production threshold and above , where new degrees of freedom come into play .",
    "reports on such measurements @xcite date back to the fifties , when suitable particle accelerators became available . in particular measurements of the reactions",
    "@xmath47 indicated a resonant behavior with @xmath48 right at the @xmath49 threshold with a width identical to that of the @xmath50 resonance .",
    "we will come back to a detailed discussion of this dibaryon candidate in sect .",
    "4.4 .      already before the publication of the quark model by gell - mann @xcite oakes considered the two - baryon system in a multiplet representation of @xmath51 following the so - called eightfold way @xcite .",
    "this led to the prediction of 10 baryon - baryon states with the following hypercharge ( y ) and isospin ( i ) combinations :    * 1 state with ( y , i ) = ( 2,0 ) containing the baryon - baryon configuration ( @xmath7 ) , * 2 states with ( y , i ) = ( 1,1/2 ) containing the baryon - baryon configurations ( @xmath52 ) , * 3 states with(y , i ) = ( 0,1 ) containing the baryon - baryon configurations ( @xmath53 ) and * 4 states with ( y , i ) = ( -1 , 3/2 ) containing the baryon - baryon configurations ( @xmath54 ) .    in the limit of exact unitary symmetry , in which the masses of the eight baryons @xmath55 and @xmath56 are degenerate ,",
    "also the baryon - baryon forces are the same and hence the masses of these baryon - baryon states are degenerate .",
    "however , since this symmetry is broken , their masses are different , but may be calculated by use of a mass formula derived from this symmetry breaking .",
    "oakes identified the single state with a @xmath7 configuration with the well - known deuteron .",
    "since this has spin - parity @xmath57 , also the other nine states should have the same quantum numbers .    by use of the gell - mann - okubo @xcite mass formula and by identifying the ( y , i ) = ( 1,1/2 ) doublet with the @xmath37 cusp at 2.13 gev , which was already known at that time ",
    "see detailed discussions in sections 4.2.5 and 8.2  he predicted the ( y , i ) = ( 0,1 ) triplet and ( -1 , 3/2 ) quadruplet states to be at 2357 and 2564 mev , respectively . since these masses are substantially larger than the masses of their constituents , he concluded that these states are far from being bound states , _",
    "i.e. _ , could only be resonance states .",
    "the quest for dibaryon states was reinforced , when it got apparent that baryons and mesons contain substructures , the quarks , and qcd does not prohibit colorless multiples of three quarks , in particular does not forbid quarks in a colorless six - pack .",
    "in fact , shortly after gell - mann s famous publication @xcite of the quark model in 1964 dyson and xuong @xcite demonstrated that su(6 ) symmetry provides a multiplet of six non - strange dibaryon states denoted by @xmath58 with @xmath59 and @xmath60 as given in table 1 .",
    "the first three states of their sextet dyson and xuong identified as the deuteron groundstate , the virtual @xmath18 isovector state  known at that time already from the final - state interaction in low - energy nucleon - nucleon scattering  and an @xmath61 state right at the @xmath62 threshold , for which first experimental indications had been available already at that time ",
    "see discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite . this way they fixed all parameters of their mass formula allowing the prediction of masses for the remaining three higher - lying states . by identifying the first two states with the deuteron groundstate and the @xmath18 virtual state with both having roughly the same mass",
    "the predicted dibaryon masses become isospin independent , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    ".    therefore @xmath65 is expected to be situated similar to @xmath66 near the @xmath62 threshold with a mass around 2160 mev . due to its isospin @xmath67 this state is decoupled from the @xmath13 system and hence can be produced only associatedly in @xmath13 collisions , _",
    "e.g. _ , in two - pion production via the process @xmath68 .",
    "for a more detailed discussion about this proposed state see sect .",
    "according to the mass formula the next higher - lying dibaryon state , @xmath69 , is expected to be at 2350 mev , _",
    "i.e. _ about 110 mev below the @xmath9 threshold . due to its quantum numbers it should asymptotically  _",
    "i.e. _ at large distances as an intermediate step in its decay or formation  conform to an isoscalar @xmath9 configuration with @xmath70 .",
    "most favorably this means two spin aligned @xmath71 particles in relative @xmath46-wave . since this state is isoscalar , it should couple to the @xmath7 system and be sensed in its @xmath72 partial wave . and because the @xmath71 excitation is highly inelastic due to its preferred decay into @xmath73 , the @xmath69 excitation will be highly inelastic , too .",
    "hence it appears to be more favorable to sense this state in the process @xmath74 rather than searching in @xmath7 scattering .",
    "in fact , such a state was observed experimentally just very recently .",
    "and indeed , it was first found in the two - pion production reaction @xmath75 , before it was confirmed in @xmath7 scattering  see sections 9 and 10 .",
    "finally , the last state , @xmath76 , predicted by dyson and xuong with quantum numbers just mirrored to @xmath69 constitutes a really exotic one .",
    "its highest charge state @xmath77 consists of six up quarks , which asymptotically yield a @xmath78 configuration . due to its large isospin",
    "this state needs to be produced associatedly in @xmath13 collisions with at least two other pions , _",
    "e.g _ in a four - pion production process of the form @xmath79 . for a search",
    "for this state see sect .",
    ".prediction of dyson and xuong @xcite about a sextet of non - strange dibaryon states based on @xmath80 symmetry .",
    "the states are denoted by @xmath58 , where @xmath81 denotes the isospin and @xmath82 the total spin of the state . given",
    "are the associated asymptotic baryon - baryon ( @xmath45 ) configurations and the masses calculated from symmetry breaking and by identifying the two lowest - lying states with the deuteron groundstate and the virtual @xmath18 state .",
    "[ cols= \" > , > , > , < , < , < \" , ]      +",
    "as we have seen , the first three states in dyson s dibaryon sextet constitute quite conventional states , where the two bags containing three quarks each do not overlap markedly .",
    "maybe it was this fact that this work did not find overwhelming attention  though as we will see below it turns out now to have quite some predictive power in view of the first observation of a non - trivial dibaryon resonance .",
    "a real dibaryon rush started , when jaffe 1977 @xcite predicted the so - called @xmath2 dibaryon , a hadronically bound @xmath11 system containing two strange quarks .",
    "this initiated a flood of further predictions on a multitude of states in all kind of baryon - baryon systems , which in turn initiated world - wide experimental searches for bound and unbound dibaryon states .",
    "as a consequence a huge number of claims have been made .",
    "however , finally not a single one survived a critical inspection .",
    "a major reason for this striking failure was certainly the insufficient quality of experimental data obtained by use of inadequate instrumental equipment .",
    "other reasons may concern the wrong choice of reaction and/or energy region , where searches have been conducted . for reviews on this epoch",
    "@xcite . for a critical , but also very amusing review of this epoch",
    "see , _ e.g. _ k. k. seth @xcite . for a",
    "more recent review from the theoretical point of view see also a. gal @xcite .      triggered by jaffe s prediction @xcite of a bound @xmath11 system many other theoretical predictions appeared in the following years based on qcd - inspired models like bag , potential , string or flux - tube models for the six - quark system @xcite , models of just the hadronic baryon - baryon interaction without any explicit quark - degrees of freedom @xcite or just symmetry considerations based on su(3 ) @xcite .",
    "most recently also lattice qcd calculations @xcite joined this subject  see discussion in section 7 .",
    "in general , the qcd - based or -inspired model calculations make use of the color - magnetic interaction between quarks giving rise to hyperfine splitting :    @xmath83    where @xmath84 and @xmath85 denote color and spin operators , respectively , of the quark i and @xmath86 is a flavor conserving short - range interaction between the quarks i and j @xcite .    as pointed out by jaffe and others , the color - magnetic interaction is most attractive in the flavor - singlet state with @xmath87 and @xmath46 = -2 , the @xmath2 dibaryon , the wavefunction of which corresponds asymptotically to baryon - baryon configurations of @xmath11 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 @xcite .    in this concept",
    "the leading dibaryon candidates having the underlying baryons in relative @xmath46 wave are states with @xcite :    * @xmath46 = 0 , @xmath6 and @xmath45 structure @xmath9 , * @xmath46 = -1 , @xmath90 and @xmath45 structure @xmath91 and @xmath92 , * @xmath46 = -2 , @xmath87 with @xmath45 structure @xmath11 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( the @xmath2 dibaryon ) and * @xmath46 = -3 , @xmath90 with @xmath45 structure @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 ,    where @xmath45 means the baryon - baryon configuration , which is asymptotically closest to the dibaryon state .",
    "the results based on eq .",
    "( 1 ) assume unbroken @xmath51 symmetry .",
    "however , realistic considerations , which account for symmetry breaking , lead to significant changes in the predicted dibaryon masses .    with respect to a possible experimental observation of dibaryon resonances ,",
    "predictions of states with low masses are particular interesting because of their expected narrow width .",
    "the nijmegen group @xcite , well - known for their partial - wave analyses of @xmath13 scattering and the therefrom derived nijmegen potential , predicted a multitude of dibaryon resonances both in non - strange and strange sectors .",
    "they introduced an elongated bag allowing for finite orbital angular momenta between delocalized quark clusters in the partitions @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "as a consequence they obtained a multitude of dibaryon states both for non - strange and strange sectors . in particular , they predicted that the lowest - lying states with masses around 2.11 gev would be @xmath13-decoupled due to their quantum numbers .",
    "because of that they were expected to have particular narrow widths . for a discussion of those states see section 5 .",
    "most calculations agree insofar as they predict no dibaryons with masses below the @xmath99 threshold thus allowing them to decay still hadronically .",
    "the possible existence of an isotensor @xmath99 bound state is based on the hope that the attractive @xmath100 interaction in the @xmath101 partial wave ( @xmath71 channel ) might provide enough attraction to bind the barely unbound isovector @xmath13 system  constituting thus a deeply bound @xmath62 system .",
    "whereas early calculations for this scenario @xcite did not support the existence of such states , garcilazo @xcite did find theoretical evidence for a @xmath102 boundstate in three - body faddeev calculations , if the pion - nucleon interaction is sufficiently short - ranged , which , however , could not be decided given the uncertainty in our knowledge of the short - range part . by use of a phenomenological @xmath71 model dillig @xcite",
    "predicted an @xmath103 state at 2020 mev , _",
    "i.e. _ just barely unbound with a width of @xmath104 = 1 mev .",
    "the los alamos theory group predicted dibaryons in the @xmath93 system , which could be so deeply bound that they would be stable with respect to strong decay @xcite .",
    "they also showed that predictions about the binding energy of the @xmath2 dibaryon critically depend on the detailed dynamics of the model under consideration .",
    "they rather emphasized the particular importance of the `` inevitable '' dibaryon , as they called it @xcite and argued that certain basic features common to all models based on one - gluon exchange and confinement lead unavoidably to the prediction of a non - strange dibaryon resonance @xmath10 with @xmath105 due to its special symmetry .",
    "being asymptotically a bound @xmath9 state it coincides with the @xmath69 state predicted by dyson and xuong .",
    "however , in the los alamos calculations it appears to be very deeply bound by nearly 400 mev . in contrast , the mit and cloudy bag model calculations @xcite obtained for it binding energies relative to the @xmath9 threshold of about 100 mev , _",
    "i.e. _ close to the value predicted before by dyson and xuong .",
    "mulders and thomas @xcite as well as saito @xcite demonstrated that pionic corrections ( `` pion cloud '' ) do not have large influence on the mass of the `` inevitable dibaryon '' , but large impact on the mass of the @xmath2 dibaryon pushing up its mass , possibly even into the unbound region .",
    "oka , shimizu and yazaki showed that also in the non - relativistic quark cluster model the @xmath2 dibaryon gets unbound @xcite .",
    "aerts and dover @xcite proposed the double - strangeness - exchange reaction as particularly suited for the @xmath2 search and calculated cross sections expected for the @xmath106 @xmath107he@xmath108 reaction .",
    "the prediction of a copious number of dibaryon states in strange and non - strange sectors initiated a rush of experimental searches for such states . naturally , the search for narrow dibaryons was particularly attractive for two reasons .",
    "first , a narrow resonance structure is much easier to discriminate experimentally against the background from conventional hadronic processes .",
    "the latter will dominate the considered reaction in general and will show also resonance - like structures due to hadronic excitations of baryons and mesons during the course of the reaction process . since the widths of typical mesonic and baryonic resonances is about 120 mev and higher , observation of much narrower structures points to a very interesting exotic process .",
    "second , in order to have a small width , the decay of a dibaryon must be hindered either    * due to its exotic internal quark structure , which provides no large overlap with the asymptotic hadronic configuration of its decay products , and / or * due to its quantum numbers , which hinder or even forbid the decay into lower - lying hadronic channels , and / or * due to its mass being below some elsewise favored particle emission thresholds or at least nearby .    _",
    "e.g. _ , if the mass of the @xmath2 dibaryon is below the @xmath11 mass , it can decay only by weak interaction and hence has a very narrow width .",
    "however , if its mass is above this threshold , it may decay by strong interaction in a fall - apart decay into @xmath11 without any hindrance and hence have a very large width typical for hadronic @xmath46-wave decays .",
    "similarly , the non - strange @xmath13-decoupled states @xmath109 and @xmath110 predicted by mulders _",
    "_ to lie above the @xmath99 threshold , should still have a fairly narrow width , since their decay into the @xmath13 channel is forbidden due to their quantum numbers . in the @xmath13 system such quantum number combinations are not allowed because of the pauli principle .      from the experimental point of view",
    "the easiest channels for the dibaryon search to access with high precision are elastic proton - proton and pion - deuteron scattering .",
    "the latter got possible with the availability of high - quality and high - intensity @xmath112 and @xmath113 beams of kinetic energies up to @xmath114 = 500 mev at the pion factories lampf , triumf and psi ( formerly sin ) , partly in combination with polarized deuteron targets .",
    "these installations also allowed precise measurements of @xmath22 scattering up to @xmath115 = 800 mev with polarized beam and/or target .",
    "still higher beam energies have been reached , _",
    "e.g. _ , in gatchina , dubna , argonne national lab , kek and saclay .    in order to access the @xmath7 system",
    "experimentally one has to either produce explicitly a secondary neutron beam or utilize the quasifree reaction process @xmath116 . in both cases deuterons",
    "are generally used as the provider of neutrons .",
    "the quasifree process has proven to work very well at beam energies of several hundred mev and above .",
    "if the spectator proton is also measured in a kinematically complete experiment , then the fermi motion within the deuteron can be utilized to measure the energy dependence of the observables over quite some range of energies simultaneously .    by the mid - nineties",

    "most of the pions produced at the production target have already decayed before reaching the final target for the actual measurement .    hence at the pion factories the first dcx measurements concentrated on pion energies in the region of the @xmath71 excitation and also on so - called double isobaric analog transitions ( diat ) in nuclei . in these reactions",
    "the isospin in initial and final nuclear states stays identical , _",
    "i.e. _ the two active neutrons in the nucleus are converted into two protons , which stay in the same nuclear orbit , thus possessing the same wave function in the final nucleus as the two original neutrons in the initial nucleus had before  only the 3rd component of the isospin is changed .",
    "hence the overlap between initial and final nuclear wave functions is maximal with the consequence that also the cross section should get comparatively large .",
    "these diat measurements in the @xmath71 region exhibited a diffraction pattern in the angular distributions , which can be accounted for in strong absorption model calculations , if an isotensor term is included @xcite .",
    "the reaction process is assumed to be a two - step process of two sequential single charge exchanges in the nucleus . in this conception",
    "the incoming positive pion gets absorbed by a valence neutron leading to a ( virtual ) @xmath201 excitation , which deexcites into a proton in the same orbit and a ( virtual ) neutral pion .",
    "the latter propagates to another neutron , preferentially in the same orbit , where it gets absorbed by exciting this neutron to a ( virtual ) @xmath202 state , which again deexcites into a proton in the same orbit and a @xmath113 particle , which is then emitted from the final nucleus .",
    "the measured dependence of the diats on the mass number a of the investigated nuclei is in agreement with this two - step process in the strong absorption limit . in this picture",
    "each step of single charge exchange proceeds with @xmath203 in the amplitude , since the charge of a pion is exchanged on a specific nucleon out of @xmath204 nucleons . due to strong absorption ( black disc ) the reaction volume",
    "is restricted to the circumference of a disc providing another factor @xmath205 in the amplitude . hence in total",
    "we expect a @xmath204 dependence of @xmath206 in the amplitude and of @xmath207 in the cross section , respectively  and this is what actually has been observed for the diat measurements in the @xmath71 resonance region .    at incident pion energies above the @xmath71 resonance region the measured cross sections get somewhat larger  as expected from the reduced pion absorption in nuclei , but basically the two - step concept for diats proved to stay valid there , too .",
    "having understood the reaction mechanism for diats in the @xmath71 resonance region and above it came as a surprise that the first measurements at low incident pion energies showed the cross sections to be largest in the region of @xmath208 50 mev .",
    "in contrast to this experimental finding two - step models had predicted cross sections to be smaller by an order of magnitude  among others due to the fact that the forward - angle single - charge exchange cross section vanishes because of the well - known destructive interference between @xmath146- and @xmath209-waves in the @xmath100 system .    in this situation g. miller @xcite proposed six - quark cluster components of nuclear wave functions as an explanation for the unexpected large diat cross section . in this scenario a dibaryonic six - cluster would be formed as an intermediate state .",
    "since the pion - absorption operator is an axial vector and due to spatial symmetry there are only two possible intermediate states with @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "such dibaryon states had been predicted by mulders and thomas @xcite with masses of 2180 and 2460 mev , respectively . though miller s calculations gave a reasonable description for the forward angle data for the diat in @xmath212c  in particular , if pion absorption is taken into account @xcite  see , _",
    "e.g. _ , fig  4.18 in ref .",
    "@xcite , conventional calculations including isotensor terms subsequently turned out to be at least as successful or even more successful @xcite  see fig . 4.19 in ref .",
    "later - on g. miller @xcite pointed out that the six - quark cluster assumption also necessitates a resonance - like energy dependence in the total diat cross section on @xmath212c , which should peak at @xmath208 425 mev , which again was not observed @xcite  see , _",
    "e.g. _ fig . 4.28 in ref .",
    ". among others a reason for this failure could have been that the two - step process of a diat not only depends on short - range correlations , but also on longer - range correlations , which possibly blur the six - quark cluster contribution .    on the contrary",
    ", short - range correlations play a central role in non - analog transitions , which mostly have been measured as a transition between ground states , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath213c(@xmath199)@xmath213o .",
    "in fact , initially the cross sections of these non - analog transitions were massively underestimated .",
    "since no simple two - step picture was available for this process , it were thought to have tiny cross sections .",
    "however , first measurements in the @xmath71 resonance region revealed these cross sections to be of the same order of magnitude as the diats and partly nearly as large as those . also unexpectedly , the observed dependence on the nuclear mass number a was not that of a two - step process , namely proportional to @xmath207 , but that of an effective one - step process being proportional to @xmath214 .",
    "the latter can be understood , if the two active neutrons are exchanged into two protons in a single step , so that in the strong absorption limit we have a dcx amplitude being proportional to @xmath215 = @xmath216 .",
    "another unexpected feature of the non - analog transitions observed in the @xmath71 resonance region and above was the energy dependence of the forward - angle cross sections , which revealed a resonance - like structure reminiscent of a @xmath71 excitation in nuclei ",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig - dcx ] . in general ,",
    "the peak was found to be just around the @xmath71 mass , whereas the width of the observed structure was somewhat smaller in the range of 70 - 90 mev @xcite .    to accommodate these unexpected features in an appropriate model description , the so - called @xmath62 interaction ( dint ) model",
    "has been designed @xcite , where  as in the diat process ",
    "the incoming @xmath112 particle initially excites a neutron to @xmath201 .",
    "however , the subsequent @xmath62 interaction does not lead to the exchange of a @xmath131 with the neighboring neutron , but to the exchange of a @xmath112 with the consequence that the neighboring neutron is charge exchanged to a proton , whereas simultaneously the @xmath201 is charge exchanged to @xmath202 , which subsequently decays into proton and emitted @xmath113 particle .",
    "since this effective single - step process certainly is of very short range , it has been proposed @xcite that the dint process may involve six - quark clusters in the intermediate state . though this is similar to miller s proposal ,",
    "it is now explicitly specified only for the short - range dint process .",
    "in addition johnson and kisslinger @xcite showed that the contribution of the intermediate @xmath210 state is small compared to that of the @xmath217 state .    from the comparison to the experimental results for non - analog transitions it follows that the dominating intermediate state , which gives rise to the @xmath71-like resonance structure in the energy - dependence of non - analog transitions , does not correspond to a mass of 2460 mev as predicted by mulders and thomas @xcite and adopted by miller , but to a mass of 2140 - 2170 mev , _",
    "i.e _ , a mass corresponding closely to the @xmath62 mass . that way it would rather represent the @xmath65 dibaryonic state predicted to be at the same mass as @xmath66 by dyson and xuong @xcite",
    " see sections 3.2 and 11.2 .",
    "an even more exciting feature of non - analog transitions has been revealed by subsequent measurements @xcite at low energies .",
    "there these transitions exhibit in general not only larger cross sections than at higher energies , but also a very pronounced narrow resonant structure in the energy dependence ( fig .",
    "[ fig - dcx ] ) , which we will discuss in detail in the following .",
    "on the basis of a qcd string model schepkin and coworkers at itep , moscow , predicted the lowest - lying dibaryon states to be a triplet of isoscalar states with @xmath219 and @xmath220 having an l=1 orbitally excited @xmath181 structure .",
    "this triplet corresponds to the triplet predicted by the nijmegen group on the basis of the mit bag model , however at somewhat smaller masses , in the range 2050 - 2140 mev @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath221 and @xmath220 members of the triplet can not couple to the @xmath13 system due to their quantum numbers , the only possible hadronic decay channel is @xmath99 . in consequence",
    "the decay width should be very small in the range of only few mev or even below .",
    "due to spin - orbit splitting the @xmath220 state was expected to be the lowest - lying state .",
    "since the predicted mass range corresponded just to the bump structure seen around @xmath208 50 mev in the diats on @xmath212c and also @xmath222o , martemyanov and schepkin proposed the @xmath220 state to be the reason for this observed structure @xcite .",
    "indeed , in subsequent work @xcite it could be demonstrated that all low - energy data on diats and non - analog transitions in nuclei ranging from @xmath223li to @xmath224nb could be quantitatively described by the assumption of the excitation of a narrow dibaryon resonance in the intermediate state : the @xmath218 . only , the experimental angular distributions requested a spin - parity assignment of @xmath221 instead of the previously assumed @xmath220 assignment .    in the description of the data",
    "the dibaryon resonance effect has been assumed to sit upon a background of non - resonant conventional processes . in case of diats",
    "these conventional processes have been described by the model of auerbach _ et al .",
    "_ ( aggk ) , where the two - step process is calculated within the seniority concept for the nuclear structure aspects @xcite .",
    "the exceptional role of the diat on @xmath225ca , which constitutes the only case , where no bumpy energy dependence at low pion energies was observed , has been successfully explained by this model .",
    "however , for all other cases this model largely underestimated the measured cross sections .",
    "in particular , it could not explain the observed steep resonance - like energy dependence there .",
    "this failure had been common to other theoretical investigations at that time .    for the non - analog transitions , which exhibit the resonance - like structure with a width of only about 20 mev even much more pronounced ,",
    "no adequate conventional description had been available , since the aggk model predicted vanishing cross sections in general .",
    "the dint mechanism , which was the only quasi single - step process to describe the data at higher energies , also provided only tiny cross sections , since at @xmath208 50 mev solely the low - energy tail of the @xmath71 excitation is left .",
    "hence essentially the full measured cross section was attributed to the @xmath226 resonance excitation .",
    "resonance @xmath226 interfering with the dint mechanism forming a resonating @xmath62 system . from refs .",
    "[ fig - dcx],width=340 ]    a consistent successful description of all low - energy dcx data , both diats and non - analog transitions , was achieved with the @xmath226 model by adjustment of just the resonance parameters for mass and width resulting in a mass of @xmath227 mev , a decay width into the @xmath99 system of 0.5 mev and a spreading width due to the nuclear surrounding of 10 - 20 mev @xcite .",
    "the further broadening of the resonance due to the fermi motion of the active nucleon pair was calculated microscopically .",
    "it should be noted that in initial calculations a spreading width of only 5 mev was assumed , which gave too large @xmath226 contributions .",
    "the success of the @xmath226 hypothesis to describe the low - energy dcx data initiated a number of theoretical investigations for such a dibaryon @xcite .",
    "the tbingen theory group @xcite calculated a possible dibaryon with the quantum numbers @xmath228 of @xmath226 in constituent quark , quark shell - model , colored quark cluster and quark pair creation models . as a common result",
    "the mass of such a dibaryon was found to be in the range of 2300 - 2400 mev , if the confinement parameters obtained from the baryon spectrum were used . only if the confinement was strongly weakened and thus the size of such a dibaryon was enlarged , a mass as well as a decay width as low as needed for the explanation of the dcx data was obtained .",
    "ueda calculated such a dibaryon solely by use of @xmath229 dynamics .",
    "initially he obtained a mass in the range 2060 - 2090 mev @xcite , but in an improved calculation he obtained a mass of only 4 - 5 mev above the @xmath99 threshold , _",
    "i.e _ around 2022 mev @xcite .",
    "essentially the same conclusion was reached by garcilazo solving nonrelativistic faddeev equations with hadronic interactions @xcite . in further studies within the framework of @xmath230 and quark cluster models",
    "it was concluded that @xmath226 should have isospin @xmath67 rather than @xmath231 @xcite , which also is compatible with the experimental observations .",
    "it also was shown that such a dibaryon resonance will increase its width in the nuclear medium by an order of magnitude  in agreement with experiment  but change its mass by only a few mev .",
    "a @xmath232 dibaryon resonance was also looked at in the skyrme model and it was demonstrated that this model leads to such a low - lying state only , if the isospin is @xmath67 @xcite  in agreement with the conclusion reached by garcilazo _",
    "et.al._.    a crucial disadvantage of using the dcx reaction for the dibaryon issue is that it can be conducted only on nuclei , but not on the basic @xmath21 system , since the latter is unbound and hence not available as a target .",
    "therefore any theoretical comparison with the data suffers from the fact that the nuclear structure in initial and final states is not fully under control .",
    "the substantial nuclear structure dependence of dcx calculations for diats and also non - analog transitions has been demonstrated impressively in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it has been shown that uncertainties in the nuclear wavefunctions can easily lead to a factor of two uncertainty in the predicted cross sections ",
    "in addition to pion wave distortion , which at least partially is the cause for the rapid fall - off of the cross section beyond @xmath114 = 50 mev . taking all this into account , a number diats and non - analog transitions can be accounted for at least qualitatively by conventional calculations , though the data remain still much better reproduced by the @xmath226 resonance assumption .",
    "the lightest target nucleus for observing the dcx process in a binary reaction to a discrete final state is @xmath223li . for lighter nuclei",
    "the dcx process leads only to the unbound nuclear continuum . with regard to @xmath226",
    "this means that it no longer can be formed off - shell in the presence of @xmath204 - 2 nucleons , but only produced on - shell associatedly with the simultaneous release of spectator nucleons into the continuum  with the consequence that the @xmath226 signature in this now inclusive dcx measurements will be much less pronounced .",
    "nevertheless , detailed dcx continuum measurements have been carried out on @xmath107he @xcite and @xmath233he @xcite , but the results finally were inconclusive on the question of @xmath226 , since it turned out that the initially assumed small spreading width was strongly underestimated @xcite . with the more realistic spreading width the @xmath226 effect in these measurements got too small to be uniquely identified .    finally ,",
    "also in this case the existence of a narrow dibaryon resonance could not be established unambiguously and nature might have bluffed us again .",
    "though the description of the data by inclusion of the as of yet hypothetical @xmath226 resonance works amazingly well , it can not be excluded that by the complexity of nuclear structure and pion - nucleus interaction the observed resonance structure may finally find its explanation in a capricious composition of diverse conventional effects .",
    "a possibility to search for @xmath226 in a basic reaction is neutral pion photoproduction from the deuteron , which has been discussed already above in section 4.2.3 .",
    "however , the estimated @xmath226 production cross section in this reaction is in the order of 0.5  -  1  @xmath234b compared to a background from conventional processes , which is larger by nearly two orders of magnitude @xcite . a high - resolution measurement @xcite of the @xmath142 reaction at mami found no statistically significant signal from a narrow dibaryon resonance at masses below 2100 mev .",
    "but the deduced upper limits were still an order of magnitude larger than the predicted @xmath226 signal , so that also this measurement could not provide an answer , whether @xmath226 really exists .",
    "also electro - production of @xmath226 has been looked at by using argus data on @xmath235@xmath236 .",
    "though the invariant @xmath128 and @xmath138 spectra were in agreement with the @xmath226 hypothesis , no firm conclusion could be drawn due to low statistics @xcite .",

    "we will discuss the results from corresponding measurements in section 8.3 .",
    "recently the quest for strange dibaryons experienced a revival , when akaishi and yamazaki @xcite predicted deeply bound antikaonic nuclear systems .",
    "it was argued that if the attractive @xmath238 interaction is strong enough to form @xmath239-nuclear sytems with binding energies such large that they reside below the @xmath240 threshold , then such states will have a very narrow width and constitute very compact objects .",

    "the situation changed drastically , when @xmath313-induced two - pion production was looked at , though the pathway towards a dibaryon resonance was still far from being straightforward .      since the sixties there existed an unsolved problem concerning the two - pion production in cases , when the participating nucleons merge into a nuclear boundstate  the so - called double - pionic fusion reactions .    in 1960",
    "abashian , booth and crowe @xcite noticed in the inclusively measured @xmath352hex reaction that there is a substantial enhancement in the @xmath107he missing mass spectrum corresponding to the emission of two pions .",
    "this enhancement cumulated at masses close to the threshold of twice the pion mass .",
    "subsequent measurements demonstrated that this effect  corresponding to a low - mass enhancement in the spectrum of the @xmath344 invariant mass  occurs in the double - pionic fusion reactions @xmath353 , @xmath354he@xmath344 and @xmath355he@xmath344 , but not in the fusion to @xmath107h in the reaction @xmath352h@xmath344 @xcite . since in the latter case",
    "the pion pair must be in an isovector state , it was concluded that the observed enhancement must be correlated with the creation of an isoscalar pion pair .",
    "first attempts for explaining this effect by an unusually strong @xmath344 interaction or a narrow @xmath177 meson had soon to be abandoned due to conflicts with experimental results from other two - pion production processes .",
    "since this low - mass enhancement was especially pronounced at beam energies , where the colliding nucleons could undergo a mutual excitation into their first excited state , the @xmath50 , it was finally proposed @xcite that the conventional @xmath9 excitation by @xmath192-channel meson exchange  as depicted schematically in fig .",

    "were looked at , for which data already existed from runs dedicated to the @xmath140 production at threshold . as a result it was found @xcite that there is , indeed , a highly visible low - mass enhancement but no high - mass enhancement as seen in previous inclusive measurements . as already suspected in ref .",
    "@xcite this putative high - mass enhancement was in reality due to @xmath140 and three - pion production .",
    "having now an established strong low - mass enhancement , but the @xmath192-channel @xmath9 concept no longer as a valid explanation , it was suggested that the abc effect might be a sign of a quasi - bound @xmath9 system @xcite .",
    "however , if this denotes a resonance phenomenon in the system of two baryons , then it would need to show up also as a resonance structure in the total cross section of the basic double - pionic fusion , which is the one to the deuteron .",

    "hence the quasi - free process with deuterons being the source for quasi - free neutrons has been utilized by the wasa collaboration  a method established before in many other experiments , see _",
    "e.g. _ refs .",
    "this process has the additional advantage that the fermi motion of the neutron within the deuteron provides a range of collision energies with a single beam energy setting . that way the energy dependence of a reaction can be conveniently scanned , which is particularly well suited for the search for narrow resonances .",
    "however , a precondition for a successful use of the quasi - free process is that the four - momenta of * all * ejectiles are determined experimentally , which necessitates exclusive and kinematically complete measurements .",
    "first such measurements were conducted with wasa still at celsius . though the statistics was quite limited there due to low beam current , a clear correlation of the abc effect with a peak - like structure in the total cross section ( open triangles in fig .",

    "such a small radius means that the two quark clusters must strongly overlap and hence are expected to form a compact hexaquark system .",
    "this is also the conclusion obtained in detailed quark - model calculations , which give a radius of 0.8 fm @xcite .",
    "an electromagnetic excitation of the deuteron groundstate to the @xmath363 resonance is highly informative , since its transition formfactor gives access to size and structure of this resonance .",
    "judging just from the electromagnetic coupling constant , we expect electromagnetic decays to be suppressed by two order of magnitudes  as is borne out , _",
    "e.g. _ in the decay of the @xmath71 resonance .",
    "a technically feasible excitation of @xmath363 would start by photo- or electro - excitation from the deuteron groundstate .",
    "a real or virtual photon would need then to transfer two units of angular momentum , _ i.e. _ be of e2 or c2 multipolarity , which lowers the transition probability further .",
    "in addition , the overlap in the wavefunctions of @xmath435 and @xmath363 enters profoundly .",
    "we are aware of two theoretical calculations dealing with such a scenario @xcite , where cross sections in the range pb / sr - nb / sr are predicted for the forward angle region .",
    "this order of magnitude may be expected also by the simple consideration that the @xmath10 photo - production is facilitated by a double spinflip in the six - quark configuration of the deuteron .",
    "since the latter is in the order of @xmath436  see section 2.1.1 .",
    ", the order of cross section , given by this number multiplied with the electromagnetic coupling constant , should be @xmath437 that of the corresponding hadronic cross section @xcite .",
    "_ i.e. _ , since the peak cross section of the @xmath438 reaction is about 200 @xmath234b , the cross section of the @xmath439 reaction should then be in the order of a few nanobarn .",
    "the same order of magnitude is expected for the @xmath10 photoproduction in the @xmath406 channel .",
    "but the @xmath440 cross section due to conventional processes is two orders of magnitude larger .",
    "hence it appears very difficult to sense the resonance excitation under such conditions .    in this respect",
    "the reaction @xmath439 appears to be attractive , since there the conventional processes are expected to be particularly small @xcite . in the energy region of @xmath363 the conventional cross section is predicted to be below 20 nb .",
    "in fact , first preliminary results from mami for this reaction @xcite are in very good agreement with these predictions for incident photon energies @xmath441 600 mev , where the calculations predict cross sections of 50 - 70 nb .",
    "below that energy the calculations predict the cross section to be strongly decreasing , whereas the preliminary data show still appreciable strength , which possibly could be in accordance with a @xmath10 excitation @xcite .",
    "meanwhile also a measurement of this reaction at elph has been reported @xcite , which sees a similar energy dependence of the cross section , though its absolute value is larger by nearly a factor of two . which of the two measurements is correct , has to be still evaluated .    another way to sense such small contributions are polarization measurements .",
    "the situation looks similar to the one in elastic @xmath7 scattering .",
    "as we have shown above , the @xmath363 resonance contribution is about 0.17 mb , which is more than two orders below the total elastic cross section .",
    "however , with help of the analyzing power , which consists only of interference terms in partial waves , it was possible to filter out reliably the resonance contribution .",
    "the analogous case in electro- or photo - excitation of @xmath363 constitute measurements of the polarization of the outgoing proton in the reactions @xmath442 and @xmath443 , respectively , where @xmath235 stands for a virtual photon created in inelastic electron scattering on the deuteron . as in the analyzing power of @xmath7 scattering the angular dependence of the resonance effect in the polarization of the outgoing proton should be proportional to the associated legendre polynomial @xmath444 @xcite . therefore , the maximal resonance effect is expected to be at a scattering angle of @xmath445 = 90@xmath135 .    in fact , such an effect has already been looked for previously by kamae",
    "_ et al . _ in corresponding data from the tokyo electron synchrotron @xcite . in order to describe the observed large polarizations in the region of @xmath363",
    ", they fitted a number of resonances to the data , among others also a @xmath70 state .",
    "however , presumably due to the limited data base they only obtained very large widths for these resonances in the order of 200 - 300 mev  as one would expect from conventional @xmath9 excitations .",
    "recently , new polarization measurements from jlab appeared @xcite .",
    "their lowest energy point is just in the @xmath363 region and is compatible with a maximal polarization of @xmath446 .",
    "it confirms thus the old tokyo results in the sense that in this region there is a build - up of a very large polarization , which rapidly decreases both towards lower and higher energies , see fig .  1 in ref .",
    "of course , a dedicated measurement over the region of interest is needed , in order to see , whether a narrow structure with the width of @xmath363 can be observed in this observable .",
    "coming back to the trace followed for the detection of d*(2380 ) : the abc effect .",
    "as demonstrated by the experiments , the abc effect is strictly correlated with the occurrence of this resonance .",
    "but what is its explanation ? in ref .",
    "@xcite _ ad hoc _ a vertex function for the decay vertex @xmath447 was introduced for its description .",
    "this vertex function parameterized in form of a monopole form - factor gives a good account for the data and with it for the abc effect  see fig .",
    "[ fig - dpi0pi0 ]  , if a cutoff parameter @xmath24 as small as @xmath24 = 0.16 gev / c is used . on a first glance this appears to be a surprisingly small value being three to four times smaller than usually used in the description of hadronic processes .",
    "however , the vertex functions used there are conventionally employed for @xmath192-channel meson exchanges . in our case of an @xmath146-channel resonance decay",
    "the assumed vertex function is actually identical to that used for the @xmath448 decay with identical cutoff parameter @xcite .",
    "in fact , such vertex functions are commonly used for the description of the decay of baryon resonances @xcite with cutoff parameters being similarly small as the value obtained for the @xmath363 case .    however , the unique situation in case of double - pionic fusion  where the momentum difference between nucleons cancels when neglecting the fermi motion  is that the @xmath344-invariant mass spectrum happens to map just the momentum dependence of the @xmath447 decay , which is given by that of the vertex function .",
    "since this special kinematic condition holds no longer in case of non - fusion , this scenario also naturally explains the non - appearance of the abc effect in non - fusion reactions . for a detailed recent discussion of this issue see ref .",
    "@xcite , where also alternative concepts and other small contributions to the abc effect are discussed .",
    "kukulin and platonova @xcite , _",
    "e.g. _ , proposed an alternative scenario for the @xmath363 decay and the abc effect . instead of the decay route @xmath447 they propose the dominating decay to be @xmath449 with a relative @xmath209-wave between @xmath66 and @xmath293  as discussed in some detail already above in section 10.4.2 .",
    "in addition to this route kukulin and platonova propose a 5@xmath15 decay route @xmath450 with a very light and narrow @xmath177 meson in relative @xmath435-wave , in order to account for the abc effect .",
    "though there have been reports on the observation of narrow and/or light @xmath177 mesons @xcite , a convincing clear - cut experimental confirmation is still missing .",
    "for the celsius / wasa workshop contribution @xcite , _",
    "e.g. _ , it finally could not be excluded that the observed narrow structure possibly resulted from detector artifacts . aside from the question about a light and narrow @xmath177 meson a problem arises for isoscalar non - fusion two - pion production . in such cases",
    "no abc effect is observed .",
    "however , there is no obvious reason , why there the postulated @xmath451 decay branch should be suppressed .",
    "kukulin and platonova argue @xcite that due to the much increased phase space for the unbound @xmath13 system the centrifugal barrier for the @xmath435-wave emission of the @xmath177 meson plays here a much bigger role and might suppress its emission more than in the @xmath420 case .",
    "unfortunately , a convincing quantitative calculation has not yet been presented by these authors .",
    "also other small @xmath452-wave admixtures as they may originate from a @xmath452-wave admixture in the intermediate @xmath9 system  @xcite or by a hypothetical decay into a @xmath453 system , as considered to some extent by bugg @xcite , may lead to an abc - effect like behavior as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "if decays such as @xmath454 and @xmath455 exist , then there must be also a @xmath10 decay branch into the isoscalar @xmath99 channel because of the decays @xmath428 and @xmath456 .",
    "the analysis of wasa data on @xmath122 and @xmath403 reactions with the goal to extract the isoscalar single - pion production cross section in the @xmath363 energy region serves the aim to provide an answer for this issue . as mentioned above the preliminary results do not give any indication for such a decay @xcite .    in conclusion , the abc effect turns out to be yet another manifestation that the dominant asymptotic configuration of @xmath363 is a @xmath9 system in relative @xmath46 wave .",
    "having found one extraordinary dibaryon , of course , raises the question , whether there are more exceptional dibaryon states .",
    "in particular , a state with quantum numbers mirrored to those of @xmath363 , _",
    "i.e. _ , with @xmath457 , appears to be particularly appealing . in its highest charge state",
    "it would consist of just six up quarks .",
    "it has been predicted to have a mass similar to that of @xmath363 by a number of theoretical calculations @xcite , which have been able to predict @xmath363 at the proper mass .",
    "the calculations of mota _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite predict this state to be right at the @xmath9 threshold , _",
    "i.e. _ , much less bound than @xmath363 .",
    "since such a dibaryon is @xmath13-decoupled due to its large isospin , it can only be produced in combination with other , associatedly produced particles .",
    "for the latter pions are ideally suited due to their large isospin . hence dyson and xuong @xcite , who were the first to propose such a state ( denoted by @xmath76 , where the first index refers to the isospin and the second one to the spin of this state ) , suggested to look for this state in the reaction @xmath458 . due to @xmath81 = 3",
    "the @xmath78 configuration is the most preferred @xmath9 combination , where @xmath77 decays into . for an early attempt to search for an @xmath81 = 3 dibaryon state in proton - nucleus collisions",
    "see ref.@xcite .",
    "because of the cosy shutdown a dedicated search run could no longer be performed by the wasa collaboration . however , using runs from the wasa data base primarily performed for @xmath397 and @xmath140 production at @xmath459 = 2.72 and 2.88 gev , data sets for exclusive and kinematically complete measurements of four - pion production could be extracted @xcite .",
    "these constitute the first data in the low - energy regime of this reaction .",
    "the obtained @xmath460-invariant mass spectra do not show any significant narrow structures and are essentially compatible with a @xmath192-channel @xmath461 process . by use of detailed peak analyses upper limits for the existence of such an",
    "@xmath81 = 3 dibaryon in the mass range 2280  2500 mev could be deduced .",
    "of course , above the @xmath9 threshold of nominal @xmath462 = 2464 mev such a dibaryon state , if existent , would undergo fall - apart decay with an accordingly huge width , which makes any experimental detection practically impossible .",
    "though no solid evidence for the existence of an @xmath81 = 3 dibaryon state below the @xmath9 threshold was found , the results are still significant .",
    "the currently achievable bounds for @xmath81 = 3 dibaryon production are primarily not due to accuracy and statistics of the measurements , but due to the insufficient quantitative knowledge of the conventional mechanisms in four - pion production .",
    "so the current limits may be improved , as soon there is progress in the theoretical description of the conventional processes .",
    "nevertheless , these currently obtained upper limits are more than three orders of magnitude smaller than the formation cross section found for @xmath363 .",
    "more importantly  with the possible exception of a dibaryon mass of about 2380 mev combined with a width of about 100 mev ",
    "the upper limits are significantly smaller than the cross section for conventional @xmath78 production in the @xmath463 channel  again in sharp contrast to the corresponding situation for @xmath363 formation , where this is an order of magnitude larger than in conventional @xmath9 formation .",
    "if the interaction between the two @xmath464 particles produced side - by - side in the decay of the intermediate @xmath465 system would be attractive , then the probability to form a dibaryon should be quite large  as it is obviously the case for @xmath363 formation in the presence of an isoscalar @xmath466 system .",
    "however , the wasa results suggest that the probability for dibaryon formation in the presence of a @xmath78 system in the intermediate state is small ( with the possible exception of the case mentioned above ) .",
    "this is in support of the findings of goldman _",
    "@xcite , who predicted an attractive interaction between the @xmath9 pair in case of @xmath363 , but repulsion in case of @xmath76 and hence no dibaryon formation .      according to dyson and xuong @xcite and supported by recent faddeev calculations @xcite there should exist a @xmath13-decoupled dibaryon state with @xmath467 corresponding asymptotically to a @xmath62 system and decaying into @xmath99 .",
    "these calculations predict such a state , called @xmath65 by dyson and xuong , with a mass slightly below the @xmath62 threshold and with a width close to that of the @xmath71  featuring thus a state like @xmath66 discussed in chapter 4.4 , but with mirrored quantum numbers .",

    "experimentally there are ten thousands of kinematically overdetermined events expected to be obtainable from the wasa data base . also with respect to conventional reaction contributions",

    "we understand that there is no bound strange deuteron .",
    "obviously it is also too weak to allow for resonances . whether the current hints for a loosely bound molecular - like @xmath241 system will materialize has to be seen by future experiments . from rhic experiments we see that the hyperon - hyperon interaction tends to be still weaker",
    "however , there is hope that these kind of heavy - ion experiments may give us an answer , whether in the @xmath46 = -3 system the @xmath489 configuration has a bound state .",
    "the fact that tetra- and penta - quark systems have been observed not in the strange , but in heavy - quark sector , gives confidence that the baryon - baryon interaction there is more attractive than in the strange sector .",
    "this is also borne out by a number of model calculations , which support the hope that in this sector also dibaryonic hexaquark systems will be found in near future .",
    "the work on this issue would not have been possible without intense communications and discussions lasting partly over decades , for which i am particularly grateful to dick arndt , w. briscoe , stanley j. brodsky , d. bugg , y. b. dong , e. friedman , a. gal , t. goldman , w. gibbs , ch .",
