    "r0.4     supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite is among the most favoured and most studied extensions of the standard model ( sm ) and is capable of solving many of its problems .",
    "one of its features is that the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) provides a number of complex parameters which can serve as sources of cp violation .",
    "they are conventionally chosen to be the higgsino mass parameter , @xmath7 , the @xmath8 and @xmath9 gaugino mass parameters , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , and the trilinear scalar coupling parameters , @xmath12 , of the third generation sfermions ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "cp phases can give rise to cp - violating signals in collider experiments  @xcite , which have to be measured to determine or constrain the phases independently of measurements of electric dipole moments ( edm ) .",
    "although also cp - even observables , such as masses or branching ratios , are sensitive to the cp phases , cp - odd observables are needed for direct evidence of cp violation .    in this report",
    "neutralino pair production @xmath14 , for @xmath15 , and the subsequent leptonic two - body decay of one of the neutralinos @xmath1 followed by @xmath16 , for @xmath3 , at the ilc is studied  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ shematic picture ] shows a schematic picture of the process .",
    "the cp - sensitive spin correlations of the neutralino in its production process allow to probe the phase of the higgsino mass parameter @xmath17 and the gaugino parameter @xmath18  @xcite .    a full ild  @xcite detector simulation is performed in order to investigate in detail the prospects to measure cp - sensitive observables at the ilc .",
    "all relevant sm background is taken into account , simulated with a realistic beam energy spectrum and beam backgrounds  @xcite .",
    "in neutralino production , effects from cp - violating phases can only occur if two different neutralinos are produced .",
    "cp asymmetries can then be defined with triple products of particle momenta . due to the spin correlation",
    "the asymmetries show hints for cp phases already at tree level . for the process shown in fig .",
    "[ shematic picture ] , a t - odd triple product of the beam and the final lepton momenta can be defined as  @xcite @xmath19 the corresponding asymmetry is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the cross section for neutralino production and decay .",
    "its sign depends on the charge of the leptons , which has to be tagged in the experimental analysis .    for the full simulation study",
    "a benchmark scenario has been chosen such that the gaugino phase @xmath22 corresponds to a maximal cp asymmetry and the higgsino phase is zero , since it is strongly constrained by edm bounds .",
    "the other parameters in the neutralino sector are @xmath23gev , @xmath24gev , @xmath25gev and @xmath26 .",
    "this leads to the neutralino masses @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , while the slepton masses are @xmath31 and @xmath32 . the neutralino pair production cross sections are calculated to be @xmath33 and @xmath34 , while the slepton pair production cross sections are @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the slepton pair production is the main background , since there are two lightest neutralinos and two opposite - sign electrons or muons in the final state as in the case of the neutralino @xmath37 production .",
    "furthermore , beam polarizations of @xmath38 have been chosen , which enhance slightly the susy cross section and the asymmetries , while the background from @xmath39- and chargino - pair production is suppressed . in this scenario",
    "the cp asymmetries are @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the ild is a concept under study for a multipurpose particle detector for the ilc .",
    "it is designed for an excellent precision in momentum and energy measurement over a large solid angle .",
    "a detailed description can be found in  @xcite . in the simulation all active elements and also cables , cooling systems , support structures and dead regions are taken into account  @xcite .",
    "the radiation hard beam calorimeter is used to suppress background from @xmath42 events at low angles .",
    "all relevant sm backgrounds and susy processes are generated using ` whizard `  @xcite .",
    "a clean sample of signal events is needed in order to clearly measure the cp - violating effects in neutralino production .",
    "otherwise the asymmetry will be reduced by the cp - even background events",
    ". therefore , preselection cuts as listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : preselectioncuts ] are applied to reject as much background as possible , while preserving good signal efficiency .",
    "electrons and muons are identified using the _ particle flow _",
    "approach  @xcite .",
    "the cuts exploit the energy and angular distributions of the final state leptons , as well as the high missing transverse momentum @xmath43 due to the escaping neutralinos .",
    "additional cuts on the total visible energy @xmath44 as well as on the invariant mass @xmath45 distributions further reduce the background contamination .",
    ".preselection cuts , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details.[tab : preselectioncuts ] [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     it is remarkable that the moduli of the phases @xmath46 , @xmath47 can also be determined with high precision , using the cp - even observables alone .",
    "however , only an inclusion of cp - odd asymmetries in the fit allows to resolve the sign ambiguities of the phases . without the cp - odd asymmetries in the fit",
    "there is a twofold ambiguity , @xmath48 , and even fourfold if @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the triple product asymmetries are not only a direct test of cp violation , but are also essential to determine the correct values of the phases .",
    "the first full detector simulation study to measure susy cp phases at the ilc has been presented .",
    "triple products of the final state lepton momenta in neutralino decays have been used as cp - odd observables .",
    "realistic collider conditions have been simulated and all relevant sm backgrounds have been taken into account . a detailed cut flow analysis has been performed , including the development of a kinematic selection procedure that was used to obtain a very clean signal sample and to distinguish events from different neutralino decays . in the chosen benchmark scenario",
    "the asymmetry could be measured with a relative precision of 10% with 500fb@xmath50 of data .",
    "finally , the parameters of the neutralino mixing matrix have been fitted to cp - even and cp - odd observables and the complex phases could be determined with a precision of about 10% .",
    "we would like to thank steve aplin , mikael berggren , jan engels , frank gaede , nina herder , jenny list , and mark thomson for very useful discussions and help with the detector simulations ."
