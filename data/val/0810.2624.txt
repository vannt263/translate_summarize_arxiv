    "agn feedback is now a critical element of state - of - the - art models of galaxy evolution tailored to solve some of the outstanding issues at the upper end of the galaxy mass function .",
    "observationally , a picture emerges where agn feedback is most likely related to the mechanical energy output of the synchrotron emitting , relativistic plasma ejected during the radio - loud phases of agn activity : giant cavities in the hot , x - ray emitting halos of massive galaxy clusters filled with radio plasma are robust evidence for agn feedback heating the gas on scales of massive galaxy clusters ( e.g. , mcnamara & nulsen , 2007 ) .",
    "best et al . ( 2006 ) analyzed a large sample of early - type galaxies from the sdss catalog with first and nvss radio data and found that heating by the radio source may well balance gas cooling over 2 orders of magnitude in radio power and in stellar mass .",
    "however , since most of the growth of massive galaxies was completed during the first few gyrs after the big bang , observations at low redshift can only provide evidence that agn feedback is able to _ maintain _ the hot , hydrostatic halos of massive early - type galaxies ( _ `` maintenance mode '' _ ) . if we want to observe directly whether agn feedback indeed quenched star formation and terminated galaxy growth in the early universe ( _ `` quenching mode '' _ )",
    ", we have to search at high redshift . with this goal",
    ", we started a detailed analysis of the rest - frame optical line emission in powerful , z@xmath02@xmath13 radio galaxies with integral field spectroscopy , where we may plausibly expect the strongest signatures of agn - driven winds .",
    "the observed properties of hzrgs suggest they may be ideal candidates to search for strong , agn - driven winds : they have large stellar ( seymour et al .",
    "2007 ) and dynamical ( nesvadba et al .",
    "2007a ) masses of @xmath0@xmath5 m@xmath3 and reside in significant overdensities of galaxies suggesting particularly massive underlying dark - matter halos ( e.g. , venemans et al . 2007 ) .",
    "large molecular gas masses in some sources ( e.g. , papadopoulos et al . 2000 ) and submillimeter observations suggest that some hzrgs at redshifts z@xmath6 are dust - enshrouded , strongly star - forming galaxies with fir luminosities in the ulirg regime .",
    "interestingly , the fraction of submillimeter - bright hzrgs shows a rapid decline from @xmath750% at z@xmath72.5 to @xmath815% at z@xmath92.5 ( reuland et al .",
    "this suggests that hzrgs may be particularly massive galaxies near the end of their phase of active star formation .",
    "they also host particularly powerful agn .",
    "thus , they are good candidates to search for the kinematic signatures of agn - driven winds .",
    "to directly investigate whether hzrgs may be the sites of powerful , agn driven winds , we collected a sample of hzrgs at redshifts z@xmath02@xmath13 with rest - frame optical near - infrared spectral imaging obtained with sinfoni on the vlt . including scheduled observations ,",
    "our total sample will consist of 29 galaxies spanning wide ranges in radio power and radio size .",

    "molecular gas masses in strongly star - forming galaxies at high redshift are also typically in the range of few @xmath2 m@xmath3 ( e.g. , neri et al . 2003 ) , and are a necessary prerequisite to fuel the observed starbursts with star formation rates of few 100 m@xmath3 yr@xmath14 .",
    "however , not all hzrgs have been detected in co. txs0828 + 193 specifically , which is part of our sample , appears to have less than @xmath25 m@xmath3 in molecular gas ( nesvadba et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "this illustrates that the agn winds may affect a significant fraction of the overall interstellar medium of strongly star - forming , massive galaxies in the early universe .",
    "since the velocities are near the expected escape velocity of a massive galaxy and underlying dark - matter halo (  [ ssec : kinematics ] ) , much of this gas may actually escape .",
    "four out of four hzrgs with extended radio jets show evidence for outflows with with kinetic energies of up to 10@xmath26 erg over dynamical timescales of @xmath27 yrs , and the preliminary analysis of our full sample suggests that this is far from being unusual .",
    "nesvadba et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2008 ) estimate that the outflow energies correspond to @xmath28% of the jet kinetic luminosity .",
    "if this coupling efficiency between jet and interstellar medium is typical for hzrgs with similarly powerful radio sources , then the redshift - dependent luminosity function of willott et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggests that at redshifts z@xmath0 1@xmath13 , agn - winds release an overall energy density of about @xmath29 erg s@xmath14 mpc@xmath30 .",
    "some of this energy release may contribute to heating and increasing the entropy in extra - galactic gas surrounding the hzrg , and to enhance gas stripping in satellite galaxies , so that subsequent merging with satellites will be relatively dissipationless .",
    "this may later contribute to preserving the low content in cold gas and old , luminosity weighted ages of the highly metal - enriched stellar population in massive galaxies to the present day , in spite of possible continuous accretion of satellite galaxies over cosmologically significant periods ( nesvadba et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "if the outflows are related to the nuclear activity , then the ultimate energy source powering the outflow is accretion onto the supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy .",
    "thus , models of galaxy evolution often parameterize the efficency of agn feedback by the energy equivalent of the rest mass of the black hole .",
    "since we have reason to believe that hzrgs approximately fall onto the low - redshift m-@xmath31 relationship between the mass of the supermassive black hole and velocity dispersion of the host , we can use the stellar mass estimates of seymour et al .",
    "( 2007 ) to roughly estimate the black hole mass of our targets .",
    "we find that of order 0.1% of the energy equivalent of the black hole mass in hzrgs is being released in kinetic energy of the outflows . a similar estimate based on the global energy density released by powerful radio galaxies estimated above , and the local black hole mass density yields a very similar result , @xmath4% .",
    "this is very close to what is assumed in galaxy evolution models ( e.g. , di matteo et al . 2005 ) , and highlights the likely importance of the observed outflows on galaxy evolution .",
