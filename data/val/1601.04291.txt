    "( 12 ) suggests a straightforward way to strengthen the phase transition : add new strongly interacting bosons , which is exactly the new boson(s ) in the model(s ) .",

    "the sm particle thermal masses are well known . as for the new bosons , we already have @xmath90 of order hundred of  gevs even at higgs vev @xmath85 just like thermal mass , and",

    "below the critical temperature @xmath96 , the minimum breaks electroweak symmetry . but",
    "as the global minimum of the potential , the field is still in the symmetric local minimum because the two minima are separated by a potential barrier due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "the transition proceeds via thermal tunneling , as the quantum tunneling probability has decreased due to the thermal barrier . in the broken phase ( with non - zero vev ) of the symmetric background , after nucleation the bubbles grow , it converts a false vacuum into true one .",
    "the whole universe transitions into this broken phase .",
    "the sphalerons are suppressed in the broken phase due to the w bosons gaining mass , and the weak interactions act only on very short distance scales .",
    "hence , this suppression is proportional to the gauge boson masses and proportional to the higgs vev right after the phase transition .",
    "a simple criterion for sphaleron freeze - out is obtained by assuming that the sphaleron processes decouple when their rate becomes smaller than the expansion of the u and this condition is given by @xmath97    a very good account of ewpt can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "@xmath99    where @xmath4 is the new resonance singly produced in @xmath100 collisions .",
    "the uncanny feature of this di - photon excess is a large total width of the resonance . in terms of events ,",
    "atlas collaboration has a better fit and favors a rather large width of resonance around 6 per cent of the resonance mass .",
    "here we assume @xmath101 however there are no excesses for the dijet @xcite , @xmath102 @xcite , diboson or dilepton channels . which leaves us at a challenging front to account for the 750 gev resonance .",
    "the 2hdm model alone can not produce the large cross - section observed .",
    "so it has been extended by adding a new vector - like fermion @xcite and other scalars @xcite    one may attempt to interpret the di - photon excess at as the resonant production of the singlet scalar @xmath4 with mass @xmath103  gev . considering the possible production mechanisms for the resonance at 750  gev it is important to note that the cms and atlas did not report a signal in the @xmath104 data at 8  tev in run 1 .",
    "this may be because 750  gev resonance is produced through a mechanism with a steeper energy dependence , e.g. gluon - gluon fusion . and as the centre - of - mass energy increases in the run the parton contribution of gluons and heavier quarks increases . here for a simple analysis we consider this as the dominant production mechanism and no other associated production .",
    "so the scalar with mass 750  gev decays to two photons via a loop .",
    "the cross section can be expressed as @xmath105 with the proton centre - of - mass energy @xmath106 and the parton distribution integral @xmath107 at @xmath108  tev and @xmath109 at @xmath110  tev @xcite .",
    "one can obtain a best fit guess of the cross section by reconstructing the likelihood , assumed to be gaussian , from the @xmath111 c.l . expected and observed limits in an experimental search .",
    "for the diphoton excess , we use a best fit cross section value of 7  fb found by combining the 95% cl ranges from atlas and cms at 13  tev and 8  tev for a resonance mass of 750  gev .",

    "so we see that the veracity of the effective study of the electroweak baryogenesis from the collider constraints vary on a model - to - model basis .",
    "however many individual models can shed light on the ewbg partially .",
    "as the lhc is running we would like to understand what classes of models may be consistent or at tension with with the data .",
    "requirement of ewpt of strong first order means that two minima in the potential be separated by some barrier for a certain range of temperatures so that the system can undergo from one to the other by thermal fluctuations in addition to quantum fluctuations which has a decreasing probability with the increase in barrier .",
    "in addition to this barrier the phase transition requires ew sphaleron process to be out - of - equilibrium in the broken phase to ensure that the baryon asymmetry is not washed out .",
    "this condition is expressed as : 1 higgs data rules out ewbg as the mass of the higgs being 125 gev does not limit decay rate associated with the kinetic part of the higgs action : the nambu - goldstone bosons .",
    "however if there s an loop - induced decay to di - photons then this problem can circumvented . the thermal barrier that we talked about earlier",
    "can be equivalently thought of as a thermal mass @xmath162 such that it can interplay with the @xmath163 and @xmath164 terms .",
    "equation ( 17 ) is modified from model to model : e becomes @xmath165 in the colored scalar model . and",
    "for the scalar singlet model by @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the number of real scalar singlet degrees of freedom coupling to the higgs .",
    "for the 2hdm e is replaced by @xmath168. so for the limit @xmath169 > >",
    "1 we can reach the limit of large e. this means that the higgs must have a large coupling with many light bosons .",
    "the reason that may impend this is the perturbativity bound and the boltzman suppression for heavy bosons .",
    "nonetheless one can keep on increasing the no .",
    "of bosonic degrees of freedom instead and they will contribute to the thermal loop and increase e without treading the perturbativity bound . however in this case on also needs to take care of radiative corrections to @xmath170 and must make the bosonic higgs interactions loop - suppressed .",
    "e.g. @xcite .",
    "a second way is to take the limit of @xmath170 to 0 .",
    "this in a bsm means a light scalar . which may be constrained by vacuum stability considerations @xcite and higgs exotic decay .",
    "but it may be hidden in the large sm background .",
    "a scenario may be such that the thermal barrier may arise from renormalizable tree - level higgs interactions with the new scalar fields .",
    "this is given by the cubic term in the effective potential .",
    "the strong pt condition lead to @xmath171 . here the limits for increasing the fraction is d > > @xmath170 which means increasing the coupling between the higgs and the light particles .",
    "this is similar to the e > > @xmath170 of the previous case . also if @xmath172 .",
    "the ew symmetric and broken vacua are degenerate and @xmath96 vanishes .",
    "this type of model is breifly discussed in @xcite",
    "in the work carried out it is understood that despite there being a fair possibility of the new 750 gev scalar being responsible for strong first order phase transition and thus transferring the baryon asymmetry to our present universe cp violation is yet to be studied .",
    "although some novel mechanisms exist which give an idea on cp - invariant asymmetry scenarios @xcite , most of the models introduce new sources of cp - violation . not to mention the scalar resonance is yet to be confirmed at a @xmath173 level .",
    "so it may as well turn out to be but a statistical fluctuation .",
    "finally the methods used in the present work may not be enough to ascertain certain claims impeccably .",
    "we have used elementary - level minimization techniques and algorithms .",
    "parameters like temperatures were varied at 1 gev step for the parameter space scan .",
    "it well may happen we have missed out on some minima lying in between .",
    "a more rigorous and comprehensive study will follow this .",
    "similarly we plan to do other collider phenomenology studies like electroweak precision tests , etc . to constrain the properties of the scalar . or missing energy search for the new fermions introduced .",
    "other than covering a variety of models we also have in mind in putting this study on some existing theoretical framework like supersymmetry . at the end of the day with the present work",
    "it is being contemplated that the new scalar may have played a significant in early universe leading to observable effects at the scale that is being probed by the large hadron collider .",
