    "in a series of recent papers  @xcite it has been shown that upon the introduction of perturbations , stable relativistic tori ( or thick accretion discs ) manifest a long - term oscillatory behaviour lasting for tens of orbital periods . when the average disc density is close to nuclear matter density , the associated changes in the mass - quadrupole moment make these objects promising sources of high - frequency , detectable gravitational radiation for ground - based interferometers and advanced resonant bar detectors , particularly for galactic systems .",
    "this situation applies to astrophysical thick accretion discs formed following binary neutron star coalescence or the gravitational core collapse of a sufficiently massive star .",
    "if the discs are instead composed of low - density material stripped from the secondary star in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , their oscillations could help explaining the high - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) observed in the spectra of x - ray binaries .",
    "indeed , such qpos can be explained in terms of @xmath0-mode oscillations of a small - size torus orbiting around a stellar - mass black hole  @xcite .",
    "the studies reported in the papers mentioned above have considered both schwarzschild and kerr black holes as well as constant and nonconstant ( power - law ) distributions of the specific angular momentum of the discs .",
    "however , they have so far been limited to purely hydrodynamical matter models , neglecting a fundamental aspect of such objects , namely the existence of magnetic fields .",
    "there is general agreement that magnetic fields are bound to play an important role in the dynamics of accretion discs orbiting around black holes",
    ". they can be the source of viscous processes within the disc through mhd - turbulence  @xcite , as confirmed by the presence of the so called magnetorotational instability ( mri ) ( @xcite ) that regulates the accretion process by transferring angular momentum outwards .",
    "in addition , the formation and collimation of the strong relativistic outflows or jets routinely observed in a variety of scales in astrophysics ( from micro - quasars to radio - galaxies and quasars ) is closely linked to the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ( grmhd hereafter ) numerical simulations provide the best approach for the investigation of the dynamics of relativistic , magnetized accretion discs under generic nonlinear conditions . in recent years",
    "there have been important breakthroughs and a sustained level of activity in the modelling of such systems , as formulations of the grmhd equations in forms suitable for numerical work have become available .",
    "this has been naturally followed by their implementation in state - of - the - art numerical codes developed by a number of groups ( _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) many of which have been applied to the investigation of issues such as the mri in accretion discs and jet formation .",
    "moreover , very recently  @xcite has derived an analytic solution for an axisymmetric , stationary torus with constant distribution of specific angular momentum and a toroidal magnetic field configuration that generalizes to the relativistic regime a previous newtonian solution found by @xcite .",
    "such equilibrium solution can be used not only as a test for grmhd codes in strong gravity , but also as initial data for numerical studies of the dynamics of magnetized tori when subject to small perturbations .",
    "the latter is , indeed , the main purpose of the present paper .    in this way we aim at investigating if and how the dynamics of such objects changes when the influence of a toroidal magnetic field is taken into account .",
    "we discuss the implications of our findings on the qpos observed in lmxbs with a black hole candidate , assessing the validity of the model proposed by  @xcite in a more general context .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we briefly review the equilibrium solution found by  @xcite for a stationary torus with a toroidal magnetic field orbiting around a black hole .",
    "the mathematical framework we use for the formulation of the grmhd equations and for their implementation in our numerical code is discussed in section 3 , while in section 4 we describe the approach we follow for the numerical solution of the grmhd equations .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the discussion of the initial models considered , with the results being presented in section 6 .",
    "finally , section 7 summarizes the paper and our main findings .",
    "we adopt a geometrized system of units extended to electromagnetic quantities by setting @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the vacuum permittivity .",
    "greek indices run from 0 to 3 and latin indices from 1 to 3 .",
    "the initial configurations we consider can be considered as the mhd extensions to of the stationary hydrodynamical solutions of thick discs orbiting around a black hole described by @xcite , @xcite and are built using the analytic solution suggested recently by  @xcite .",
    "the basic equations that are solved to construct such initial models are the continuity equation @xmath4 for the rest - mass density @xmath5 , the conservation of energy - momentum @xmath6 , and maxwell s equation @xmath7 , where the operator @xmath8 is the covariant derivative with respect to the spacetime four - metric and @xmath9 is the dual of the faraday tensor defined as @xmath10 in this expression @xmath11 is the fluid four - velocity and @xmath12 is the magnetic field measured by an observer comoving with the fluid . as usual in ideal relativistic mhd ( _ i.e. _ , for a plasma having infinite conductivity ) , the stress - energy tensor @xmath13 is expressed as @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the metric coefficients , @xmath0 is the ( thermal ) pressure , @xmath16 the specific enthalpy , and @xmath17 .",
    "the equilibrium equations are then solved to build stationary and axisymmetric fluid configurations with a toroidal magnetic field distribution in the tori and a constant distribution of the specific angular momentum in the equatorial plane .",
    "the main difference of our solution with that of @xcite is that we employ a polytropic equation of state ( eos ) of the form @xmath18 for the fluid , where @xmath19 is the polytropic constant and @xmath20 is the adiabatic index .",
    "such an eos has a well - defined physical meaning and differs from the one used by @xcite , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the fluid enthalpy , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are constants .    by imposing the condition of axisymmetry and stationarity in a spherical coordinate system ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath25 ) , the hydrostatic equilibrium conditions in the @xmath26 and @xmath27 directions are given by @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the angular velocity appearing in ( [ bernoulli ] ) is defined as @xmath31 the specific angular momentum is given by @xmath32 and the components of the magnetic field are @xmath33    following  @xcite , we consider the following eos for the magnetic pressure @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath24 are constants , and which essentially amounts to confining the magnetic field to the interior of the torus . using this relation , we can integrate eq .",
    "( [ bernoulli ] ) , which in the case of constant specific angular momentum yields @xmath36 where the potential @xmath37 is defined as @xmath38 .",
    "note that in general there will be two radial locations at which @xmath39 equals the keplerian specific angular momentum .",
    "the innermost of these radii represents the location of the `` cusp '' of the torus , while the outermost the `` centre '' .",
    "when a magnetic field is present , the position of the centre does not necessarily correspond with that of the pressure maximum , as in the purely hydrodynamical case .    in order to solve eq .",
    "( [ bernoulli ] ) a number of parameters are needed to define the initial model , namely @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath24 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and the ratio of the magnetic - to - gas pressure at the centre of the torus , @xmath41 .",
    "thus , using the definition of @xmath42 , we obtain the rest - mass density at the centre of the torus from the following expression : @xmath43= 0 .",
    "\\label{eq : motion2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    finally , the equilibrium equation ( [ bernoulli ] ) can be solved to obtain the distribution of all relevant magnetohydrodynamic quantities inside the torus ( @xcite ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , there has been intense work in recent years on formulations of the grmhd equations suitable for numerical approaches  @xcite .",
    "we here follow the approach laid out in  @xcite and adopt the @xmath44 formulation of general relativity in which the 4-dimensional spacetime is foliated into a set of non - intersecting spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "the @xmath44 line element of the metric then reads @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the 3metric induced on each spacelike slice , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the so - called lapse function and shift vector , respectively .    under the ideal mhd condition , maxwell s equations @xmath49 reduce to the divergence - free condition for the magnetic field @xmath50 together with the induction equation for the evolution of the magnetic field @xmath51\\ } , \\label{eq : evb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and @xmath53 , with @xmath54 and @xmath55 being respectively the spatial components of the velocity and of the magnetic field , as measured by the eulerian observer associated to the @xmath44 splitting .    following  @xcite , the conservation equations for the energy - momentum tensor given by eq .",
    "( [ stress - tensor ] ) together with the continuity equation and the induction equation for the magnetic field can be written as a first - order , flux - conservative , hyperbolic system .",
    "the state vector and the vector of fluxes of the fundamental grmhd system of equations read @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",

    "note that the following fundamental relations hold between the four components of the magnetic field in the comoving frame , @xmath12 , and the three vector components @xmath55 measured by the eulerian observer @xmath67 finally , the modulus of the magnetic field can be written as @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "casting the system of evolution equations in flux - conservative , hyperbolic form allows us to take advantage of high - resolution shock - capturing ( hrsc ) methods for their numerical solution .",
    "the hyperbolic structure of those equations and the associated spectral decomposition of the flux - vector jacobians , needed for their numerical solution with riemann solvers , is given in  @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we complete our discussion of the spectral properties of these oscillating discs , by showing in fig . [ fig6 ] the psd for model @xmath70 , which , we recall , represents a torus orbiting around a kerr black hole with spin @xmath71 . as for the previous spectra",
    ", the dashed line corresponds to the unmagnetized version of model @xmath70 and is included for reference .",
    "overall , the features observed in a kerr background are very similar to those found for models in the schwarzschild case .",
    "also in this case , in fact , the fundamental mode , its first overtones and the nonlinear harmonics are clearly identified and no evidence appears of new modes related to the presence of a toroidal magnetic field .    as a final remark we note that the @xmath72 ratio among the different @xmath0 modes has a relevance also in a wider context .",
    "we recall , in fact , that among the several models proposed to explain the qpos observed in lmxbs containing a black hole candidate , the one suggested by  @xcite is particularly simple and is based on the single assumption that the accretion disc around the black hole terminates with a sub - keplerian part , _",
    "i.e _ a torus of small size",
    ". a key point of this model is the evidence that in these objects the frequencies of the fundamental mode and the first overtone are in the @xmath72 harmonic sequence in a very wide space of parameter .",
    "the simulations presented here further increase this space , extending it also to the case of magnetized tori and thus promoting the validity of this model for qpos to a more general and realistic scenario .      as pointed out by  @xcite the oscillating behavior of perturbed accretion tori",
    "is responsible for significant changes of their mass quadrupole moment . as a result",
    ", these changes determine the emission of potentially detectable gravitational radiation if the tori are compact and dense enough .",
    "this could be the case if the tori are produced via binary neutron star mergers or via gravitational collapse of the central core of massive stars . in this section ,",
    "we extend the analysis of  @xcite for unmagnetized discs and investigate the gravitational - wave emission from constant angular momentum magnetized tori orbiting around black holes .",
    "although more sophisticated approaches involving perturbative techniques around black holes can be employed to study the gravitational - wave emission from these tori ( @xcite ) , we here resort to the simpler and less expensive use of the newtonian quadrupole approximation ( @xcite ) , which has been suitably modified to account for the presence of a magnetic field , as done by  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the quadrupole wave amplitude @xmath73 , and which is the second time derivative of the mass quadrupole moment , is computed through the `` stress formula '' ( @xcite ) @xmath74   \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 is the gravitational potential , and is approximated at the second post - newtonian order from the metric function @xmath79 .     as fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] but for model @xmath70.,width=288 ]    figure  [ fig7 ] shows a spectral comparison between the designed strain sensitivity of the gravitational - wave detectors virgo and ligo , and the logarithm of the power spectrum @xmath80 of the gravitational - wave signals for models @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath70 ( similar graphs are obtained also for the other models ) .",
    "note that all of the sensitivity curves displayed in this figure assume an optimally incident wave in position and polarization ( as obtained by setting the beam - pattern function of the detector to one ) , and that the sources are assumed to be located at a distance of 10 kpc .     of the wave signal for models",
    "@xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath70 and the strain sensitivity of ligo ( dashed line ) , virgo ( long - dashed line ) .",
    "[ fig7 ] , width=288 ]    from fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] it is clear that all our models lie well above the sensitivity curves of the detectors for galactic sources and also that there are no significant differences in the power spectra as the magnetic field strenght is increased . interestingly , however , the signal from a torus orbiting around a kerr black hole is clearly distinguishable from the one around a schwarzschild black hole . besides having a fundamental mode at higher frequencies , in fact ,",
    "also the amplitude is about one order of magnitude larger as a result of it being closer to the horizon and with a comparatively larger central density .",
    "as expected from the similarities in the dynamics , the signal - to - noise of these magnetized models is very similar to one of the corresponding unmagnetized tori , and we refer to @xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "we have presented and discussed the results of numerical simulations of the dynamics of magnetized relativistic axisymmetric tori orbiting in the background spacetime of either schwarzschild or kerr black holes .",
    "the tori , which satisfy a polytropic equation of state and have a constant distribution of the specific angular momentum , have been built with a purely toroidal magnetic field component .",
    "the self - gravity of the discs has been neglected and , as the models considered are all marginally stable to accretion , the minute accretion of mass and angular momentum through the cusp is not sufficient to affect the background black hole metric .",
    "the use of equilibrium solutions for magnetized tori around black holes has allowed us to study their oscillation properties when these are excited through the introduction of small perturbations .",
    "in particular , by considering a representative sample of initial models with magnetic - field strengths that ranged from @xmath83 g up to equipartition , and grmhd evolutions over 100 orbital periods , we have studied the dynamics of these discs and how this is affected by a magnetic field .",
    "overall , we have found the behaviour of the magnetized tori to be very similar to the one shown by purely hydrodynamical tori ( @xcite ) . as in the hydrodynamical case , in fact",
    ", the introduction of perturbations triggers quasi - periodic oscillations lasting tens of orbital periods , with amplitudes that are modified only slightly by the small loss of matter across the cusp .",
    "the absence of an inital poloidal magnetic field has prevented the development of the magneto - rotational instability , which could influence the oscillation properties and thus alter our conclusions ( @xcite ) .",
    "determining whether this is actually the case will be the focus of a future work , where a more generic magnetic field configuration will be considered .",
    "as for unmagnetized tori , the spectral distribution of the eigenfrequencies shows the presence of a fundamental @xmath0-mode and of a series of overtones in a harmonic ratio @xmath1 .",
    "the analogy with purely hydrodynamical simulations extends also to the nonlinear harmonics in the spectra and that are the consequence of the nonlinear coupling among modes , ( in particular the @xmath84 mode and of its first overtone @xmath85 ) .",
    "also for them we have found a behaviour which is essentially identical to that found in unmagnetized discs . in summary ,",
    "no new modes have been revealed by our simulations , and in particular no modes which can be associated uniquely to the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "nevertheless , the influence of the magnetic field is evident when considering the absolute values of the eigenfrequencies , which are shifted differentially to higher frequencies as the strength for the magnetic field is increased , with an overall relative change which is @xmath86 for a magnetic field near equipartition .    besides confirming the unmagnetized results , the persistence of the @xmath72 ratio among the different @xmath0 modes also has an important consequence .",
    "it allows , in fact , to extend to a more general and realistic scenario the validity of the qpo model presented by  @xcite and @xcite , and which explains the qpos observed in the x - ray luminosity of lmxbs containing a black hole candidate with the quasi - periodic oscillations of small tori near the black hole .",
    "the evidence that this harmonic ratio is preserved even in the presence of toroidal magnetic fields , provides the model with additional robustness .    when sufficiently massive and compact , the oscillations of these tori are responsible for an intense emission of gravitational waves and using the newtonian quadrupole formula , conveniently modified to account for the magnetic terms in the stress - energy tensor , we have computed the gravitational radiation associated with the oscillatory behaviour .",
    "overall , we have found that for galactic sources these systems could be detected as they lie well within the sensitivity curves of ground - based gravitational - wave interferometers .    as a concluding remark",
    "we note that our discussion here has been limited to tori with magnetic fields whose pressure is at most comparable with the gas pressure , _ i.e. _ , @xmath87 .",
    "the reason behind this choice is that while in equilibrium , the magnetized tori with a purely toroidal magnetic field are not necessarily stable .",
    "rather , indications coming both perturbative calculations and from nonlinear simulations , suggest that these tori could be dynamically unstable for sufficiently strong magnetic fields .",
    "the results of these investigations will be presented in a forthcoming paper  ( @xcite ) .",
