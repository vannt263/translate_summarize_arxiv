    "quantum coherence , as a prominent resource for quantum information processing , has found its various diversified applications in quantum cryptography @xcite , quantum computation @xcite and quantum metrology @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , until very recently , there still lacks a rigorous information - theoretic framework for characterizing coherence and a great deal of effort has been devoted to this significant and long - standing topic @xcite . exploiting the quantum resource theory @xcite , baumgratz _ et al . _",
    "proposed a framework for quantifying coherence based on distance or pseudo - distance measures @xcite , by noting that a similar line of thought has been successfully applied in the theory of quantum entanglement @xcite . within this framework ,",
    "several reasonable postulates has been proposed which should be satisfied by all _",
    "bona fide _ measures of quantum coherence .",
    "moreover , as a prerequisite , a _",
    "fiducial basis _ should be pre - selected for determining the exact value of quantum coherence , according to the specific theoretic considerations or physical implementations . in other words , the coherence measures defined in ref .",
    "@xcite are all _ basis - dependent _ quantities . for a simple example , the eigenvectors of pauli matrices @xmath1 and @xmath2 constitute two mutually unbiased bases , that is , each incoherent basis pure state is a maximally coherent state with respect to the other basis @xcite .",
    "therefore , a natural question is raised : what are the maximum and minimum coherences contained in a given quantum state with respect to the random bases ?",
    "notably , this problem is not only theoretically motivated but also experimentally relevant .",
    "since quantum coherence has been identified as the essential resources for certain quantum information tasks , it will be preferred to extract the coherence content of a given state as much as possible . obviously , the key issue is to find out a reference basis with respect to which the coherence value is maximal .",
    "it is noteworthy that a similar but distinct problem has been discussed by singh _",
    "@xcite , where a notion of maximally coherent mixed states ( mcmss ) was considered and in fact they obtained the maximally achievable quantum coherence for a fixed mixedness in the computational basis .",
    "however , while in ref .",
    "@xcite the purity is the only independent variable , here we expect that the maximally achievable value of quantum coherence may depend on the entropy or eigenvalues of the given state .    in this work",
    ", we mainly focus on the coherence measures of relative entropy and @xmath0 norm , which are the only monotones that are found to satisfy all criterions proposed in @xcite until now .",
    "while any pure state can always be transformed to a maximally coherent state by a change of basis , we realize that for general mixed states the situation becomes much more complicated and subtle .",
    "although it seems counter - intuitive , we found that the condition for achieving maximum values of coherence is not universal and measure - dependent .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we briefly review the resource framework of quantum coherence and define the problem in standard notations . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we identify the basis in which the relative entropy of coherence of a given state is maximal and the significance of the fourier matrix ( complex hadamard matrices ) is illustrated . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we prove that this basis is ( at least ) suboptimal for optimizing the @xmath0 norm of coherence and the properties of the circulant matrix is emphasized . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , we perform a detailed numerical simulation and demonstrate that the basis associated with the fourier matrix is not global optimal . the sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] is devoted to the conclusion and discussion of the main results and several open questions are presented for future investigation .",
    "throughout the paper , we adopt the resource theory of quantum coherence proposed by baumgratz _",
    "_ in @xcite .",
    "this theoretical framework has been successfully applied for quantifying quantum entanglement @xcite . except for some basic notions , such as the free states and free operations defined in their own context",
    ", the quantum resource theories mainly rely on two ingredients : ( i ) a series of reasonable postulates that should be fulfilled by each measure or indicator of genuine resource ; ( ii ) a set of contractive geometric metrics @xcite . in the corresponding resource theory of coherence , the free ( incoherent ) states are those diagonal in a pre - selected basis in the @xmath3-dimensional hilbert space @xmath4 , denoted by the set @xmath5 .",
    "accordingly , the the free ( incoherent ) operations are completely positive and trace preserving quantum maps @xmath6 admitting an operator - sum representation where every kraus operator @xmath7 will transform the set of incoherent states into itself @xcite , that is , @xmath8 .    except for the nullity condition and convexity requirement , each _ bona fide _ measures of quantum coherence @xmath9 are assumed to be a monotone function under the non - selective and sub - selective incoherent measurements , namely @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 . note that the latter constraint combined with convexity condition will lead to the former , which implies the latter is a stronger monotonicity requirement .",
    "based on these criteria , several potential candidates were put forward for the quantification of coherence @xcite .",
    "however , so far only two measures have been identified to fulfill all the requirements , that is , the relative entropy of coherence @xmath13 and the @xmath0 norm of coherence @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the diagonal part of @xmath17 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the coherence measures induced by @xmath18 norm and the fidelity do not constitute valid coherence monotones , since for both quantities the strong monotonicity ( [ sm ] ) do not hold in general @xcite .",
    "moreover , though the trace - norm measure of coherence was proved to be a strong monotone for all qubit and @xmath19 states , a recent work showed that the trace norm of coherence can not be regarded as a legitimate coherence measure for general states @xcite .",
    "in such a framework , a pre - determined _ fiducial basis _ is prior to any evaluation of the value of coherence .",
    "recall that a specific orthonormal basis corresponds to a particular matrix representation of a given density matrix ( the maximally mixed state @xmath20 is an exception since it is always diagonal in any bases ) . from the definitions of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , it is easy to see that any density matrix with off - diagonal entries in such a representation will be identified as a resource state ( having non - zero coherence value ) with respect to this fiducial basis . furthermore , it is noteworthy that any two distinct orthonormal bases are connected with a unitary operator @xcite and this remarkable fact indicates that with reference to the computational basis @xmath21 , any random basis @xmath22 can be fully characterized by a unitary operator @xmath23 drawn randomly from the set of unitary matrices , with a _",
    "one - to - one correspondence _ @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , for a given density matrix @xmath25 , the evaluation of quantum coherence in a random basis @xmath26 is equivalent to considering the coherence of @xmath27 in the the computational basis @xmath28 , that is @xmath29    therefore , the problem of determining in which basis the matrix representation will display the maximum or minimum coherence is tantamount to finding out the corresponding unitary transformations .",
    "in fact , according to the spectral theorem @xcite , any normal operator is diagonalizable and thus , for a given density matrix @xmath25 , the minimum coherence is always zero in which case the eigenvectors of @xmath25 form the columns of this particular @xmath23 .",
    "however , on the other hand , it is not immediately intuitive that in which basis we can acquire the maximum coherence .",
    "now let us consider a fixed density matrix @xmath25 in the @xmath3-dimensional hilbert space @xmath4 . in this section we will mainly concentrate on @xmath30 , since the entropy function solely depends on the eigenvalues of its argument and is usually easier to handle",
    ". to begin with , two observations caught our attention .",
    "first , regardless of the fiducial basis , @xmath30 is universally upper bounded by @xmath31 in fact , this inequality stems from the majorization relation @xmath32 , also known as the schur - horn theorem @xcite .",
    "note that though @xmath25 itself always remain unchanged with respect to the basis change , the diagonal part @xmath16 will definitely depend on different matrix representations .",
    "the tightness of this upper bound is equivalent to whether there exists a specific basis in which the matrix representation of @xmath25 has equal main diagonal elements .",
    "the second observation is recapitulated in the following lemma , which was proved by horn and johnson using two different approaches @xcite .",
    "denote the set of @xmath3-dimensional square matrices by @xmath33 .",
    "then for each @xmath34 , there exists a unitary matrix @xmath35 such that all the diagonal entries of @xmath36 have the same value @xmath37 .",
    "this lemma is a rather general result and implies that @xmath30 can always achieve the upper bound of eq .",
    "( [ ub ] ) through the change of basis",
    ". however , the proves in ref .",
    "@xcite do not indicate the explicit form of this particular @xmath23 .",
    "the following theorem spells out the exact form of this type of @xmath23 and thus the corresponding basis .",
    "there exists a set of unitary operators @xmath23 such that @xmath30 achieves the maximum value @xmath38 for a given density matrix @xmath25 , where the reference basis is defined by @xmath39 .",
    "the unitary transformation has the form @xmath40 , where @xmath41 consists of the eigenvectors of @xmath25 as its column vectors and @xmath42 belongs to the set of ( rescaled ) complex hadamard matrices .",
    "[ t1 ]    _ proof .",
    "_ from eq .",
    "( [ er ] ) , the evaluation of coherence value of @xmath25 in the transformed basis @xmath39 is equivalent to that of @xmath43 in the computational basis . due to the spectral decomposition of @xmath44 , without any loss of generality , we assume @xmath45 by proper arrangement of the order of the eigenvectors in @xmath41",
    ". then we have @xmath46 let us denote the elements of the matrix @xmath47 as @xmath48_{ij}=a_{ij}$ ] . adopting the einstein convention , the diagonal entries in this matrix representation are @xmath49_{ii}&=[h]_{ik}\\lambda_k\\delta_{kl}[h^\\dagger]_{li } = \\lambda_kh_{ik}h^\\ast_{ik } \\nonumber\\\\ & = \\frac{1}{d}\\sum_k\\lambda_k=\\frac{1}{d},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we prefer the _ rescaled _ definition of complex hadamard matrices ,",
    "that is , @xmath50 with complex entries of equal modulus @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52    to gain a better understanding of how the theorem works , we would like to take some time to further illustrate the notion of complex hadamard matrices .",
    "a complex hadamard matrix @xmath53 is commonly defined as a @xmath3-by-@xmath3 matrix with complex _",
    "unimodular _ entries such that @xmath54 @xcite . here",
    "we rescale a complex hadamard matrix to a corresponding unitary matrix , and thus the @xmath3 vectors formed by the columns of such a matrix constitute a complete set of orthogonal basis of @xmath55 .",
    "it is noteworthy that each of this set of basis vectors is mutually unbiased with respect to the computational basis . that is , following the notations of ref .",
    "@xcite , these basis vectors are _ maximally coherent states _ in the standard basis .",
    "another important concept is the equivalence relation between two different complex hadamard matrices .",
    "two hadamard matrices @xmath56 and @xmath57 are called equivalent , denoted by @xmath58 , if there exist diagonal unitary matrices @xmath59 and @xmath60 and permutation matrices @xmath61 and @xmath62 such that @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are so - called generalized permutation matrices or monomial states @xcite , which are unitary matrices with the matrix representation in the standard basis containing precisely one nonzero entry in each row and column .",
    "therefore , the reordering of the rows and columns or enphasing of the off - diagonal entries of a complex hadamard matrix does not alter its equivalence class .",
    "consequently , every complex hadamard matrix can be transformed to a _ dephased _ form , where the entries of its first row and column are all equal to @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "an important example is the fourier matrix , which exists for all dimensions and is naturally of the dephased form @xmath67_{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}\\textrm{e}^{\\frac{2\\pi \\textrm{i}\\mu\\nu}{d}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}\\omega^{\\mu\\nu } , \\quad \\mu,\\nu=0,\\ldots , d-1\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we denote by @xmath68 the @xmath3- root of unity . on the other hand , if we choose the standard basis @xmath69 to be incoherence basis , then the diagonal unitary matrices @xmath70 and permutation matrices @xmath71 ( and thus monomial matrices @xmath72 ) in such a basis are all incoherent unitary operators , due to the criterion derived in ref .",
    "moreover , since the inverse matrices of @xmath70 and @xmath71 are still incoherent operations , all these incoherent unitary matrices are coherence - value - preserving operations ( cvpos ) @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , it is easy to prove that the cvpos admitted by all valid coherence measures are monomial matrices , which in fact are combinations of enphasing and relabeling",
    ". therefore , due to its simplicity and significance , henceforth we adopt the fourier matrix as the primary representative of complex hadamard matrices , though some of the following conclusions also hold for this whole set of matrices .      for a qubit system ,",
    "the fourier matrix is just the so - called hadamard gate of quantum computation @xmath73 by applying the hadamard gate to the standard basis @xmath74 , the following two vectors can also be obtained @xmath75 is mutually unbiased with respect to @xmath74 , or equivalently , each basis state in one set is the maximally coherent state with respect to another . in this context",
    ", the hadamard gate can be termed as a _ maximally coherent operator _ for a qubit system @xcite . as a generalization of the hadamard gate in arbitrary finite dimension",
    ", the fourier matrix ( in fact , all complex hadamard matrices ) inherits the properties of the hadamard gate .",
    "namely , we can obtain a so - called _ dual basis _ by applying @xmath76 on the computational basis @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the kronecker delta function .",
    "remarkably , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the eigenvectors of the generalized pauli operator @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively @xcite @xmath83 and further we have @xmath84    in fact , in terms of @xmath80 and the eigenvectors @xmath85 of @xmath86 , the unitary operators @xmath41 and @xmath76 in theorem [ t1 ] can be written as @xmath87 therefore , @xmath88 and the transformed state @xmath27 is given by @xmath89 since @xmath90 are maximally coherent states in the computational basis , the transformed state @xmath27 is a weighted mixture of @xmath80 and thus has equal main diagonal entries with respect to the standard basis .      as a byproduct",
    ", we can arrive at a conclude that @xmath18 norm of coherence @xmath91 also achieves the maximum value exactly in the same basis , though the strong monotonicity condition is not satisfied by @xmath91 .",
    "first , for a given density matrix @xmath92 , the @xmath18 norm of coherence is defined by @xcite @xmath93 where @xmath94 is called the hilbert - schmidt norm or the frobenius norm ( and is occasionally written as @xmath95 for that reason ) @xcite .",
    "an important property of the frobenius norm is the unitary invariance , that is , for any @xmath96 and arbitrary unitary matrices @xmath97 @xmath98 therefore , basis change does not alter the frobenius norm of a given density matrix and one can only focus on the diagonal parts of matrix representations for distinct bases , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ l2 ] ) .    moreover , in an arbitrary basis , the diagonal part of the corresponding matrix representation constitutes a nonnegative vector of @xmath99 with elements summing to unity . denote such a vector by @xmath100 and the uniformly distributed probability vector by @xmath101 .",
    "apparently , @xmath101 is majored by arbitrary vector @xmath102 , that is @xcite @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 is the specified incoherent basis ( not necessarily the computational basis ) . since",
    "the function @xmath106 ( for @xmath107 , here we choose @xmath108 ) is schur - convex @xcite , we have @xmath109 therefore , the maximum value of @xmath91 for a fixed @xmath25 is given by @xmath110 which is only dependent on the purity of the density matrix and is thus reminiscent of the results and discussions in ref . @xcite .",
    "in this section we concentrate on the @xmath0 norm of coherence @xmath111 . among all the valid quantifiers ,",
    "the concept of quantum coherence is more directly embodied in the mathematical definition of @xmath111 , due to the fact that any nonzero off - diagonal elements of a density matrix will definitely contribute to the `` nonclassicality '' in a given basis . however , despite the simple structure of @xmath111 , it seems difficult to immediately find out in which basis @xmath14 achieves the maximum value for a given state .",
    "indeed , in view of theorem [ t1 ] , it is natural to assume the optimal basis is also related to the standard basis by a compound unitary operator , e.g. , @xmath112 , where @xmath41 still diagonalizes the density matrix @xmath25 but the structure of @xmath23 is unknown . at this stage ,",
    "the transformed state is given by @xmath113 using the einstein summation convention , the elements of @xmath114 are of the form @xmath115_{ij}&=[u]_{ik}\\lambda_k\\delta_{kl}[u^\\dagger]_{lj}=\\sum_k\\lambda_ku_{ik}u_{jk}^\\ast.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , the @xmath0 norm of coherence is equal to @xmath116 nevertheless , so far what we know about @xmath23 is only the unitary property , that is , @xmath117 .",
    "the mathematical subtlety does not prevent us from _ guessing _ the structure of the unitary matrix @xmath23 .",
    "the first thing comes into our sight is the universal freezing phenomenon that occurs for quantum correlation or quantum coherence measures @xcite . here",
    "the word _ universal _ means that under certain initial conditions this phenomenon will inevitably occur independently of the adopted measures , e.g. , it is a common feature of all known _ bona fide _ measures .",
    "this consistency makes us wonder whether the optimal basis for @xmath30 also leads to the maximal value of @xmath111 . before tackling with the most general case",
    ", we realize that some low - dimensional examples and numerical simulations will be beneficial for justifying our conjecture .      for a qubit system",
    ", the general one - qubit unitary operator can be parameterized as @xmath118 where @xmath119 .",
    "note that the diagonalization process of @xmath25 can be absorbed into the unitary transformation due to the basis change .",
    "the transformed state @xmath114 is given by @xmath120 it follows that @xmath14 for this particular basis ( associated with @xmath121 ) is equal to @xmath122 the above inequality is satisfied as an equality when @xmath123 .",
    "indeed , such a unitary matrix is equivalent to the dephased form , e.g. , the fourier matrix @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , we proved that our conjecture is true at least for general qubit states .",
    "besides , it is easy to see that our conjecture also hold for the case of pure states in arbitrary dimensions , since any pure state have only one nonzero eigenvalue , e.g. , @xmath125 and @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) . from eq .",
    "( [ l1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath128 where we denote the elements of the fourier matrix by @xmath129_{ij}=f_{ij}$ ] .",
    "note that the value of @xmath111 is upper bounded by @xmath130 @xcite .",
    "thus , this result implies that every pure state in finite dimensions can be represented as a maximally coherent state through the change of basis and this optimal basis is the one defined by the fourier matrix ( in fact by all complex hadamard matrices ) .",
    "however , the optimization problem starts to become complicated even for general mixed qutrit states .",
    "in fact , a complete parameterization of the space of unitary matrices includes @xmath131 independent real parameters ( e.g. , euler angles ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems clueless if we perform a brute - force optimization process over nine independent real variables .",
    "to gain more insight , we first observe the transformed state concerning this _ suspected _ optimal basis : @xmath132 where @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "thus , for general qutrit states , @xmath14 is given by @xmath135 where we have used the relation @xmath136 .",
    "in addition to the expected symmetry of this expression , when @xmath125 and @xmath137 , @xmath138 coincides with the above pure state case .",
    "moreover , if @xmath139 ( that is , @xmath25 is the maximally mixed state ) , @xmath140 since the maximally mixed state is the only state that is diagonal in any basis .",
    "so far , we may be convinced that the basis associated with the fourier matrix is optimal for the @xmath0 norm of coherence .",
    "in fact , the lagrange multiplier method will give us further evidence .",
    "in essence , the issue discussed in this work is an optimization problem .",
    "more precisely , we pursue the maximum value of eq .",
    "( [ l1 ] ) subject to the unitarity property @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , we introduce the lagrange function @xmath141 where @xmath142 are the lagrange multipliers and to simplify the notation , we define @xmath143 note that @xmath144 is the matrix element of the given density matrix with respect to the basis @xmath145 and thus the symmetry @xmath146 holds .",
    "the ( local ) extreme value of @xmath111 corresponds to a stationary point for the lagrange function @xmath147 .",
    "the first - order partial derivatives are given by @xmath148 multiplying eq .",
    "( [ condition1 ] ) by @xmath149 and summing over @xmath150 , we obtain @xmath151 similarly , from eq .",
    "( [ condition2 ] ) we have @xmath152 therefore , @xmath153 is the very condition that should be satisfied by the optimal unitary matrix @xmath23 .",
    "now we can demonstrate that the condition @xmath154 is indeed fulfilled by the fourier matrix . for @xmath76 , the matrix elements @xmath144 reduce to @xmath155 therefore , apart from @xmath156 , there are two additional properties possessed by @xmath144 : ( i ) _ periodic property _",
    "@xmath157 ; ( ii ) _ circulant property _",
    "@xmath158 $ ] , which means that the value of @xmath144 is only dependent on the difference of subscripts .",
    "note that the condition @xmath154 requires that @xmath159 due to the periodic property ( i ) , the summation term in eq .",
    "( [ summation ] ) is also a periodic function .",
    "thus the summation over @xmath160 can be rearranged to any such region @xmath161 for arbitrary integer @xmath162 . by defining @xmath163 , the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ summation ] ) amounts to @xmath164 where in the last equality we have made the substitution @xmath165 .",
    "finally , the circulant property ( ii ) guarantees that eq .",
    "( [ summation ] ) indeed holds for the fourier matrix .",
    "remarkably , meanwhile we observe that the elements @xmath144 constitute a celebrated _ circulant matrix _",
    ", which is a special kind of toeplitz matrix @xcite ( see appendix [ a1 ] ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that circulant matrices have many significant connections to problems in physics , image processing , cryptography and geometry . for more details and further discussions ,",
    "we refer the readers to the book by p. j. davis @xcite . in summary",
    ", the above results can be recapitulated into the following theorem .",
    "the basis associated with the unitary matrix @xmath166 is at least suboptimal ( e.g. , a local extremum condition ) for the @xmath0 norm of coherence .",
    "meanwhile , the transformed state @xmath167 is a circulant matrix in the standard basis .",
    "based on the above facts , we are thus tempted to conjecture that the specific basis associated with @xmath168 is also global optimal for the @xmath0 norm of coherence and the maximum value @xmath169 for a given density matrix @xmath25 can be formulated as ( see appendix [ a2 ] for details ) @xmath170}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to verify this conjecture , we can perform a numerical simulation aiming at exhausting the different fiducial bases . as argued in section [ sec2 ] , the choice of a random basis is equivalent to uniformly sampling an element from the group of unitary matrices . to generate random unitary matrices , here",
    "we adopt a simple method proposed by mezzadri , which is constructed according to the _ haar measure _ @xcite .",
    "such a space of unitary matrices is usually referred to as the circular unitary ensemble ( cue ) @xcite .    as a typical example , we first focus on the @xmath171 case and the vector of eigenvalues is chosen to be @xmath172 in descending order .",
    "we have run the simulation program from @xmath173 to @xmath174 times ( see table [ tabular1 ] ) .",
    "two observations caught our attention : ( i ) with the increasing count of randomly generated unitary matrices , the maximal values found in the corresponding simulations is getting closer to _ but never exceed _ the conjectured optimal value @xmath175 ; ( ii ) the corresponding unitary matrices are also becoming closer to the complex hadamard matrices .",
    "for instance , among @xmath174 random unitary matrices , the optimal one takes the form @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the matrix of entrywise absolute values of @xmath23 and note that @xmath178 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that for @xmath179 , all complex hadamard matrices are isomorphism to the fourier matrix , which implies it represents the only equivalence class of complex hadamard matrices @xcite .",
    "moreover , the expression of @xmath175 remains unchanged with respect to permutations of the vector of eigenvalues @xmath180 .",
    "there facts presents strong evidences that for @xmath171 the fourier matrix is optimal for the @xmath0 norm of coherence .",

    "@xmath186 and the dashed red line denotes the conjectured optimal value of @xmath187 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    however , for @xmath188 the situation is totally different from the former case . for later discussion , here we present the analytical formula of @xmath189 as @xmath190 first , as for the example chosen in figure [ fig1 ] , we have not observed any violation of @xmath189 up to @xmath182 random runs ( here we only plotted @xmath181 runs for simplicity and the statistics of @xmath182 is similar ) . yet from @xmath183 runs we begin to observe the violations of @xmath189 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "up to @xmath184 runs , totally @xmath191 violations can be observed .",
    "corresponding to the maximal value of @xmath111 ( @xmath192 ) found in our simulation , the matrix of entrywise absolute values of @xmath23 is of the form @xmath193 which indicates that @xmath23 is far from being a complex hadamard matrix .",
    "moreover , when considering the whole class of complex hadamard matrices that is equivalent to the fourier matrix ( e.g. , @xmath194 ) , only the permutation @xmath62 contributes to the the coherence value of @xmath195 , since @xmath59 and @xmath61 are incoherent unitary operations @xcite .",
    "in fact , the unitary matrix @xmath41 can also provides this freedom by rearranging the order of its columns .",
    "therefore , for this equivalent class , the conjectured optimal value is updated to @xmath196,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath197 is the set of all permutations of the vector @xmath198 . however , by convention we perviously assume that the vector @xmath198 is in descending order and for the example raised in figure [ fig1 ] this order already gives the maximum value of @xmath169 .",
    "thus , the numerical simulations demonstrate that in general not only the fourier matrix but also the whole equivalent class of complex hadamard matrices are not optimal for the @xmath0 norm of coherence .    besides , we also performed the simulation for @xmath199 and observed that only up to @xmath182 runs the maximal value found in the simulation already violates that of @xmath169 .",
    "nevertheless , the above evidences do not exclude the possibility that other inequivalent class of complex hadamard matrices may result in the global optimal coherence value .",
    "note that the full construction and classification of complex hadamard matrices in arbitrary finite dimensions is still an open question .",
    "for example , this problem is unsolved even for @xmath200 @xcite .",
    "therefore , for high dimensions , a much more complicated numerical method is needed to verify the conjectures .",
    "in this work , we concentrate on the following question : for a given density matrix , in which basis the valid measures of quantum coherence will achieve the maximum values ? on one hand , we have proved that all the bases associated with the unitary operator @xmath201 is genuinely optimal for the relative entropy of coherence and @xmath18 norm of coherence , where @xmath42 represents all complex hadamard matrices .",
    "indeed , this result stems from the fact that the columns ( or rows ) of complex hadamard matrices are mutually unbiased with the standard basis . on the other hand , although we also proved that this type of bases are still optimal for general qubit states and pure states in arbitrary dimensions , numerical simulations show that the fourier matrix ( and its equivalent class ) is only suboptimal for our purpose , especially in high - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "in contrast to the freezing phenomenon for all coherence measures @xcite , this result is somewhat counter - intuitive and indicates that the condition for achieving maximum values of coherence measures is not universal and measure - dependent .",
    "quite recently , zanardi _ et al .",
    "_ investigated the coherence power of quantum unitary operators and they found that all complex hadamard matrices have maximal coherence generating power @xcite .    in view of these results , it is worth pointing out that there exist several interesting connections between our work and some previous findings .",
    "first , the issue discussed in this work can also be regarded as a coherence - creating problem .",
    "in fact , the method raised in ref .",
    "@xcite is a particular case of theorem [ t1 ] , by noting that @xmath202 where @xmath81 is the generalized pauli operator and stratifies @xmath203 .",
    "second , the maximum achievable coherence values pursued in this work can also be viewed as a _ basis - independent _ quantity .",
    "this is thus reminiscent of the concepts introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , that is @xmath204 where @xmath205 equals the maximum @xmath0 norm of coherence for fixed mixedness in a system while @xmath206 characterizes to what extent the given state deviates from the maximally mixed state .",
    "in fact , there exists a simple direct relationship between them @xmath207 .",
    "intriguingly , we found that for @xmath208 and @xmath209 , the formula of @xmath205 coincides with that of @xmath169 , due to an equivalent expression of @xmath206 @xcite @xmath210    finally , since @xmath169 is only suboptimal for @xmath0 norm of coherence , the global optimal basis and the exact structure of the associated unitary matrix is still left as an open question .",
    "we wonder whether this optimal basis can be directly derived from the criteria that any valid coherence measures should satisfy @xcite .",

    "as a special kind of toeplitz matrix , the rows ( or columns ) of a circulant matrix are composed of cyclically shifted versions of a length-@xmath3 vector .",
    "namely , a @xmath3-dimensional circulant matrix @xmath211 takes the form @xmath212 that is , a circulant matrix is fully specified by a vector @xmath213 and the entries of @xmath211 only rely on the difference of the subscript @xmath214 @xmath215_{ij}=c_{(i - j)\\,\\textrm{mod}\\,d},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in our context , the elements of the circulant matrix is given by @xmath216_{ij}=\\theta_{ij}=\\frac{1}{d}\\sum_k\\lambda_k\\omega^{(i - j)k}$ ] and especially the entries on the main diagonal are all equal to @xmath217 .",
    "another important property of circulant matrices is that they can always be diagonalized by the fourier matrix @xcite . in this work ,",
    "the diagonalization is of the form @xmath218 where @xmath219 with @xmath220 the eigenvalues of @xmath25 ( and also of @xmath211 ) .",
    "in fact , for general circulant matrices , the eigenvalues are given by @xmath221 it is easy to check that @xmath222 in our case by use of the identity eq .",
    "( [ orthogonality ] ) .",
    "as shown in appendix [ a1 ] , for the unitary matrix @xmath166 the transformed state @xmath167 is actually a circulant matrix . in this specific basis",
    ", the @xmath0 norm of coherence can be expressed as @xmath223 where we define @xmath224 .",
    "furthermore , we have @xmath225},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the desired formula .",
