    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) can not only test the standard model ( sm ) but also probe the physics beyond the sm , enabling the exploration of new physics .",
    "some potential events indicating the effects of new physics have indeed been reported by the atlas and cms experiments .",
    "for instance , diboson resonance at around 2 tev was shown by atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite ; an unexpectedly large branching ratio ( br ) for @xmath5 was given by cms  @xcite .",
    "the search for new resonances has been performed by cms and atlas in the dijet decays at the center - of - energy of @xmath6 tev  @xcite and in the dilepton channels  @xcite .",
    "although no significant excess has been observed , the data can give strict limits on the mass of resonance and its couplings to the sm particles .",
    "moreover , a hint of a new resonance with a mass of around 750 gev in the diphoton spectrum was reported by the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite experiments .",
    "inspired by the measurements , the diphoton excess issue was broadly discussed  @xcite . however , a clearer signature of the diphoton resonance is not confirmed by the updating data of atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite , and the significance of the resonance is somewhat diminished . nevertheless , it is still a good channel to probe a new resonance through the diphoton decay . since several observed phenomena",
    "have not been resolved yet , such as the origin of neutrino masses , dark matter , and anomalous muon @xmath7 , it is believed that the sm gauge symmetry @xmath8 is an effective theory at the electroweak scale .",
    "it is of interest and importance to explore the existence of other gauge symmetry , in which the new force carrier(s ) and particles are involved .",
    "the extended gauge symmetries of the sm have been widely studied in the literature , such as @xmath9  @xcite and @xmath10  @xcite models .",
    "especially , if a new charged gauge boson is observed , it must be the representation of some non - abelian gauge group . in this work ,",
    "we thus consider a minimal non - abelian gauge extension of the sm and investigate the phenomenological implications at the lhc .",
    "we extend the sm by introducing a new @xmath0 gauge symmetry , where two new charged gauge bosons @xmath11 and one neutral gauge boson @xmath9 are involved . in order to minimize the number of new particles , a vector - like quark ( vlq ) doublet of the @xmath0",
    "is introduced , where new leptons are not necessary to cancel the gauge anomaly , and the @xmath10 can decay into the vlqs and sm quarks ; a heavy higgs doublet is employed to spontaneously break the @xmath0 symmetry ; and a real singlet scalar is introduced to dictate the heavy higgs production via the gluon - gluon fusion ( ggf ) processes .",
    "that is , there are only four new matter particles , three new force carriers , and one new gauge coupling in this model .",
    "we note that the new @xmath0 gauge symmetry is not the @xmath12 , where the sm right - handed fermions belong the doublets of @xmath12 .",
    "the sm particles in the model are the @xmath0 singlet states .",
    "in addition to introducing the vlqs , one can also adopt the new representations , which are similar to the fourth generation of the sm gauge symmetry , to be @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 under @xmath19 .",
    "since more new particles are involved in such model , it is expected that these new particles will lead to richer phenomena , such as more collider signatures , lepton and quark flavor physics , and @xmath20 can be the dark matter candidate if an unbroken @xmath21 is imposed .",
    "since the involving new particles and couplings are much more than those in the model with vlqs , in this work we focus the study on the vlq model . in order to concentrate the study on the collider signatures , we assume that only the third generation sm quarks couple to the vlqs via the yukawa couplings . accordingly ,",
    "the charged current interactions of the sm quarks can be modified ; however , due to the modification being suppressed by the light quark masses , their effects can be ignored at the leading order approximation .",
    "in addition , the flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) happen between the third generation quarks and vlqs , thus , the influence on the low energy flavor physics is small .    from the electroweak @xmath1-parameter precision measurement",
    ", it is found that the @xmath10 and @xmath9 gauge bosons have to be heavier than 1 tev .",
    "if we further assume that the vlqs are heavier than the heavy higgs boson , the heavy higgs particle can only decay through the loop effects .",
    "it is known that the loop integral for a scalar to diphoton decay strongly depends on the spin property of a particle in the loop ; for instance , the ratios of loop integrals for spin-@xmath22 , -@xmath23 , and -@xmath24 particles are @xmath25  @xcite . clearly , despite the magnitudes of the couplings involved , it is more efficient to enhance the br of the diphoton decay if new spin-@xmath23 or / and -@xmath24 particles can make the contributions .",
    "hence , the @xmath10 and vlqs in the model play an important role in the properties of the heavy higgs boson .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the model . in sec .",
    "iii , we study the constraints on the new gauge coupling and masses of new gauge bosons , and analyze some phenomena at the lhc , such as exotic diphoton resonance and new particle production . the summary is then given in sec .",
    "we start by setting up the model . in this study , we extend the sm gauge symmetry to @xmath26 , where the sm particles belong to the representations of @xmath27 and are singlets of @xmath28 . to break the gauge symmetry down to @xmath29 ,",
    "we introduce two higgs doublets @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where the former is the sm higgs doublet , the latter is the heavy higgs doublet of @xmath28 , and the subscripts in the representations denote the hypercharges of the higgs doublets . in order to minimize the number of new particles , and enhance the decays of the heavy scalar boson of @xmath32 , we introduce a vlq doublet @xmath33 of @xmath28 to the model . in addition , we include a higgs singlet @xmath34 to produce the heavy higgs via ggf processes .",
    "since the sm particles , higgs doublets , and @xmath35 carry the hypercharges of @xmath36 , we define the electric charges of particles to be @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the diagonalized pauli matrix .",
    "accordingly , the electric charges of @xmath40 and @xmath41 are @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively . for clarity",
    ", we show the representations and charge assignments of particles under the gauge symmetry of @xmath44 in table  [ tab : charge ] .",
    ".representations and charge assignments of particles under the gauge symmetry @xmath45 , where @xmath35 denotes the vector - like quark , and both left- and right - handed states carry the same charges . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this section , we discuss the constraints of the new gauge coupling and some phenomena , such as the heavy higgs @xmath46 to diphoton decay and the signature of the new particles in the model at 13 tev lhc .",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath48 are the two important parameters for the @xmath46 diphoton decay , and thus we need to study their constraints . since the @xmath9-gauge boson can couple to the sm fermions and its mass is determined by @xmath47 and @xmath48 , it is of interest to understand the constraints of @xmath47 and @xmath49 from the dijet and dilepton experiments at the lhc .",
    "it is found that the constraints from dijet channels are not as strong as those from dileptons , and thus we focus on the dilepton channels .    in order to calculate the production cross section for @xmath50 ( @xmath51 )",
    ", we implement the vertices of our model into calchep  @xcite and use the cteq6l  @xcite parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) . with the interactions derived earlier , the production cross section for @xmath50 as a function of @xmath49 is presented in fig .  [",

    "the dashed red lines in the plots are the bound from the atlas experiments  @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that the cross section is decreasing when @xmath47 is increasing , and this can be ascribed to the couplings @xmath9-@xmath55-@xmath55 that depend on @xmath56 .",
    "the discontinuity at @xmath57 tev shows that the decay channels of @xmath58 are open . besides the results at @xmath53 tev",
    ", we also show the results at @xmath6 tev in fig .",

    "it is clear that the 13 tev data have a slightly stronger constraint than the 8 tev data . from the plots",
    ", it can be seen that a larger @xmath59 can weaken the constraint because the brs for @xmath60 are enhanced ; that is , the br for @xmath61 is relatively suppressed .",
