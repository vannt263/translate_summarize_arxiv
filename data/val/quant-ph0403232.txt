    "looking for quantum signatures of the classical transition from regular to chaotic dynamics is the field of quantum chaos @xcite .",
    "recently it was suggested @xcite that entanglement production in a quantum system can be a good indicator of the regular to chaotic transition in its classical counterpart .    in both of the invoked studies @xcite",
    "it was observed that the presence of chaos enhances the rate at which an initial product state is getting entangled . in the paper @xcite miller and sarkar considered coupled quantum kicked tops .",
    "single kicked top is a thoroughly studied model in the quantum chaos literature . depending on",
    "the strength of kicks its classical dynamics is either regular or chaotic .",
    "miller and sarkar studied a system consisting of two identical kicked tops with an additional weak interaction between them .",
    "the strength of kicks was chosen in such a way that the classical phase space of a single top was mixed ( consisted both of regular tori and chaotic regions ) .",
    "two tops were initially in a product state of two spin - coherent states .",
    "the reason for this choice is that spin - coherent states have a good classical limit , what gives a chance to relate the classical phase space picture to the quantum description .",
    "the spin - coherent state of the first top was chosen to lie in a chaotic region while the spin - coherent state of the second one was varied from a regular to a chaotic region .",
    "the system was then evolved and it was observed that the rate of entanglement increase ( measured as the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix ) was higher when the second top was placed in a chaotic region .",
    "more quantitatively , it was shown that for different quantum initial states the rate of entanglement increase was proportional to the sum of two positive lyapunov exponents calculated for the corresponding classical distribution of initial points .",
    "these results supported the claim about close relation between chaotic behavior of classical systems and entangling properties of their quantum versions .",
    "further investigations revealed , however , that there is no such direct relation between chaos and entanglement @xcite .",
    "in particular it was observed that it is rather a specific time correlation function than the lyapunov exponent itself that determines the entanglement production rate .",
    "strong chaos is able to destroy the time correlations even on a very short time scale and thus it diminishes initial entanglement production rate .",
    "apart from studying the entanglement production rate , which is a quantity calculated from a short - time behavior of the evolved state , one can also study asymptotic properties of entanglement , i.e.  those appearing in the long - time limit . the question",
    "whether the asymptotic value of entanglement is related to chaos was posed in @xcite . if the coupling strength between kicked tops is large enough to observe the saturation of entanglement within given time , the asymptotic value of entanglement is higher the greater is the chaos parameter ( the kick strength ) .",
    "this observation was made starting with an initial state in form of a product of two spin - coherent states placed in a region which for low kick strengths was regular , contained a part of a separatrix for stronger kicks , and eventually became chaotic for very strong kicks .    in the present paper we also concentrate on the case of coupled kicked tops . in most of the previous studies",
    "the attention was focused on analyzing how an initial product state of certain spin - coherent states evolves in time .",
    "here we would like to address a more general problem .",
    "namely , how does the strength of chaos influence the global entangling properties of the evolution of the kicked tops . by global we mean properties not depending on a specific choice of initial product state .",
    "in other words this is the question of whether the entangling capabilities of the transformation depend on the strength of chaos .",
    "global entangling properties were analyzed in the kicked ising spin chain model @xcite , where evolution of random states was investigated , and decrease of entanglement production rate with the increase of chaos was observed .",
    "another approach often used @xcite in determining the entangling power of an operation consists of analyzing its eigenvectors . in the case of periodically driven systems",
    "these are the eigenvectors of an unitary operator @xmath0 corresponding to the one - period evolution .",
    "the degree of eigenvector entanglement is then regarded as an information about entangling properties of the evolution .",
    "we show that the information about entanglement of eigenvectors does not , however , give the full picture of entanglement properties of the evolution , but only a rough estimate of the asymptotic behavior of entanglement of evolved states ( see sec.[sec : eigenasymp ] ) .    in order to discuss entangling properties of the evolution of the kicked tops , we evolve not a single product state , but a whole ensemble of random product states , chosen uniformly with respect to action of @xmath1 group , where @xmath2 , @xmath3 are the hilbert space dimensions of the two tops .",
    "we calculate the averaged asymptotic entanglement approached by evolved states , and the initial rate of entanglement production .",
    "all pure states are treated on equal footing here .",
    "spin coherent states are as good as any other pure state .",
    "this way of averaging gives us information about _ the entangling power of evolution _ , as defined in @xcite .",
    "additionally we shall calculate the entanglement production when initial states are products of two spin - coherent states , where each spin - coherent state , parameterized by two spherical angles @xmath4 , @xmath5 , is taken independently from the ensemble with uniform probability density on the unit sphere .",
    "the two ways of averaging give qualitatively different results .",
    "we shall analyze the results with the help of the perturbative approach @xcite and the analysis of the entanglement of eigenvectors .",
    "the observation that is worth mentioning here is that even in a very regular regime _ the entangling power _ is extremely high  higher than in chaotic cases  both when discussing the asymptotic entanglement behavior and the initial entanglement production rate .",
    "our results are another step to reveal the relation between chaotic vs. regular motion and entanglement production .",
    "entanglement is a purely quantum phenomenon , dividing states of a composite quantum systems into two classes : those which can be written as products of some states of the ( two in this case ) subsystems : @xmath6 ) but instead involve a genuine , nontrivial linear combination @xmath7 it is easy to check whether it is entangled or not . observe that if the state is a product one , averaging over one of the subsystems of the corresponding density matrix @xmath8 gives a pure state of the remaining subsystem : @xmath9 whereas the same procedure applied to an entangled state produces necessarily a genuine mixed state . this observation can be further quantified by calculating the linear entropy for the reduced density matrix @xmath10 which vanishes for product states and reaches the maximal value : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the hilbert space dimension of the smaller subsystem , for the  maximally entangled state ",
    "( by definition this is the state which reduces to the  maximally mixed  state of a subsystem  the latter is characterized by a diagonal density matrix with equal entries ) . in this sense @xmath13 is a measure of entanglement for pure states of a composite system .",
    "another often used measure of entanglement for pure states is the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix : @xmath14 for product states @xmath15 , as the reduced density matrix @xmath16 is also pure , while for the maximally entangled states the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix takes the highest value @xmath17 .",
    "contrary to the linear entropy , the above measure of entanglement has a nice operational meaning in terms of the number of maximally entangled states that can be distilled from a given number of non - maximally entangled states @xcite .",
    "actually all quantities which do not increase under local operations ( ie.operations acting separately in each subsystem ) and classical communication quantify in some way the amount of entanglement present in a state .",
    "these in general are called _ entanglement monotones _",
    "linear and von neumann entropy discussed above are examples of such entanglement monotones for pure states .    in the following",
    "we shall use the linear entropy ( [ linentr ] ) as the measure of entanglement .",
    "we choose this measure , instead of the von neumann entropy ( [ eq : vonneumann ] ) , as linear entropy is easier to calculate and there is a perturbative formula for initial growth of linear entropy @xcite in weakly coupled systems which we shall use .",
    "furthermore , in the investigations concerning relation between chaos and entanglement , where both von neumann and linear entropy where calculated @xcite no qualitative difference in the behavior of the two was found , thus the choice of either of them is not crucial .    it is argued that the presence of entanglement is important in many novel applications of quantum information processing @xcite , which explains the prominence enjoyed by this phenomenon in many recent investigations . in our study we shall concentrate only on the interplay between production of entanglement in a composite quantum system and its chaotic properties .",
    "the kicked top is a paradigmatic model for studying quantum chaos in finite - dimensional hilbert spaces @xcite . it is a particle with the total spin @xmath18 and the dynamics generated by the hamiltonian @xmath19 here @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the components of the angular momentum operator fulfilling the standard commutation relations @xmath22=ij_x$ ] , etc .",
    "the time dependence takes the form of an infinite train of delta - shaped pulses (  kicks  ) perturbing the free rotation periodically in time .",
    "the quantities @xmath23 and @xmath24 are adjustable parameters of the model . the latter , called the kick - strength , is scaled by the total spin @xmath18  observe that the total angular momentum @xmath25 is conserved , @xmath26=0 $ ] , hence we can investigate the dynamics of the model for each value of @xmath18 independently , restricting the discussion to the appropriate @xmath27$]-dimensional space .",
    "to exhibit various interesting dynamical aspects of the model it is enough to change one of the parameters . in the following we put @xmath28 and vary @xmath24 .    the unitary time evolution operator transporting the wave function of the kicked top in time over one period of the perturbation , @xmath29 generates the heisenberg equations of motion for the angular momentum operators @xmath30 , and @xmath21 @xmath31 giving the operators @xmath32 , and @xmath33 at time @xmath34 in terms of their predecessors @xmath35 , and @xmath21 at time @xmath36 .",
    "as in all studies of quantum chaotic phenomena we are ultimately interested in comparing quantum and classical dynamics of the model . in the present",
    "the planck constant has been set to unity hence the classical limit corresponds to @xmath37 limit (  large quantum numbers  ) .",
    "more formally one defines the quantities @xmath38 and @xmath39 as averages of @xmath40 , and @xmath41 calculated in the initial state of the system . in comparing classical and quantum behavior",
    "it is reasonable to take as an initial state some minimum uncertainty state , in belief that ( at least in the large @xmath18 limit ) the evolution of averages will be well represented by the single classical trajectory starting from the point in the phase space around which the initial quantum state of minimal uncertainty is concentrated . obviously , there is no particular reason to distinguish such states when investigating purely quantum properties like entanglement production .",
    "appropriate minimum uncertainty states for spin @xmath18 particles ( so called angular momentum coherent states ) can be generated from the @xmath42 state [ i.e. the common eigenstate of @xmath21 and @xmath43 with the eigenvalues @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively ] by unitary rotations @xmath46 and the above described procedure leads to the following classical mapping : @xmath47 a detailed analysis of the classical dynamics ( [ cem1 ] ) is given in @xcite , let us only summarize that the system is integrable for @xmath48 and becomes visibly chaotic when @xmath49 .",
    "for @xmath24 around @xmath50 the phase space exhibits well developed mixed structure with few regular islands embedded in the chaotic see .",
    "when @xmath51 islands of stability , although present , are very small and the chaos can be treated as fully developed for all practical purposes . from the point of view of quantum chaos , the islands are negligible if their phase - space area is smaller then the effective value of the planck constant ( @xmath52 in our case ) , which will be the case in our calculations .    in order to achieve our ultimate goal , ie .",
    "the investigation of parallels between chaos and entanglement we follow the idea of miller and sarkar @xcite and consider two coupled kicked tops with the hamiltonian @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the hamiltonians of independent kicked tops ( [ kt1 ] ) expressed in terms of the operators @xmath56 and @xmath57 pertaining to each individual top , whereas @xmath58 is a nonlinear coupling term @xmath59 the procedure of obtaining the classical evolution equations is exactly the same as the one for a single top described above , and yields @xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 . in the most of the following the coupling strengths",
    "@xmath63 will be small in comparison with @xmath24 , it means that the degree of chaos in the system is determined solely by properties of dynamics of individual tops .",
    "the main idea behind quantifying the entangling power of quantum evolution is to measure the ability to produce an entangled state out of an initial product state in the course of the quantum evolution .",
    "although for particular reasons or applications we can choose a concrete initial state and follow evolution of its entanglement properties when time passes , such a history would definitely bear a lot of imprints of the initial state we chose to start with . in our study",
    "we are more interested in entanglement capabilities of the system itself , so it is more reasonable to take the average over some set of initial states  the idea advanced by zanardi @xcite",
    "@xmath64 \\right\\rangle\\right\\rangle_{\\psi_1,\\psi_2}.\\ ] ] in the above formula @xmath13 is some appropriate measure of entanglement ( in our case it will be the linear entropy ) , and @xmath65 denotes averaging over a set of initial product states @xmath66 .    the averaging procedure , however , needs more detailed reflection . as mentioned in the previous section , when investigating the quantum - classical correspondence , it is reasonable to take as an initial state a spin - coherent state and , consequently , a product of two such states for a composite system",
    ". the averaging amounts to integrating over the whole set of spin - coherent states parametrized by the spherical angles @xmath67 and @xmath68 , @xmath69 in ( [ cs ] ) . in order not to distinguish any particular initial state , we average over products of two spin - coherent states each parameterized by @xmath67 and @xmath68 taken independently from the ensemble with the uniform probability density on the unit sphere",
    "this kind of averaging will be denoted as @xmath70 averaging , as our ensemble is invariant under the action of rotation in either of subsystems .",
    "as already written , there is no particular reason for such a choice of the set of initial states when global entangling production properties of our system are investigated .",
    "instead one can average over the whole set of initial product states . in order to treat all pure product states on equal",
    "footing one should choose the ensemble of product states with probability distribution invariant under the action of @xmath71 , where @xmath2 , @xmath3 are the hilbert space dimensions for the subsystems .",
    "in this way we obtain a natural ensemble of random product states .",
    "it is not a surprise that @xmath70 and @xmath72 averages can lead to different quantitative estimates of the entangling power ; what is more important they differ also qualitatively",
    ".    one can also think about other characterizations of entangling capabilities of quantum evolution operators .",
    "for example , entanglement properties of eigenvectors of @xmath0 can give some information about possible entanglement production .",
    "the matter , however , is rather subtle , as it will be clear from the subsequent discussion .",
    "in this section we present the main results of the numerical calculations of the evolution of the coupled kicked tops .",
    "the spins of our two tops are respectively @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "this choice is an effect of a compromise .",
    "the spins should be high enough to allow classical correspondence and low enough to be numerically tractable .",
    "other authors , who considered higher spins ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) , were able to perform their calculations as they were evolving only a few different states .",
    "our calculation are performed on ensembles consisting of several hundreds of states .",
    "consequently we sacrifice the spin magnitude for the sake of being able to perform averaging over many states .",
    "the chosen spins @xmath77 , @xmath78 are not equal .",
    "this does not change evolution significantly ( as compared with @xmath79 ) , but removes degeneracy among eigenstates of one - period evolution operator @xmath0 .",
    "lack of degeneracy is essential for the eigenvectors entanglement analysis , which will be explained later .",
