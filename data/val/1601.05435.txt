    "we assume @xmath5 throughout the study .",
    "the spectrum of fluctuations ( both thermal and quantum ) of the medium is constrained by boundary conditions imposed by the confining walls , and , as a result , the free energy acquires a contribution depending on the separation @xmath6 .",

    "we show that in a specific limit the casimir force is repulsive and decays as a power of the separation @xmath6 even for the periodic boundary conditions which generically yield casimir attraction .",
    "this gives a hint on the possible regime of parameters , where a repulsive casimir force might be detectable experimentally in a system involving bose - einstein condensation , and , potentially a wider class of quantum - critical systems .",

    "we believe that ( when expressed via these length parameters ) our finding should apply at least to other system belonging to the universality class of the spherical model @xcite .",
    "another important question concerns the sensitivity of our results on the boundary conditions .",
