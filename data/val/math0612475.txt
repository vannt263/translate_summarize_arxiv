    "in @xcite , kazhdan defines the notions of -semisimplicity and -unipotence of an element of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a discretely valued locally compact field with ring of integers @xmath3 and residue field ( see the definition on p.  226 of _ loc .",
    "cit . _ ) .",
    "an arbitrary element of @xmath1 can be decomposed as a commuting product of an -semisimple and an -unipotent element ( see lemma 2 on p.  226 of _",
    "loc.cit._ ) . furthermore ,",
    "stably conjugate -semisimple elements are actually @xmath1-conjugate ( see lemma 3 on p.  226 of _ loc .",
    "_ , where the result is proven for rationally conjugate elements , and lemma 13.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "kazhdan uses this last result in his calculation of the @xmath4-twisted orbital integral @xmath5 ( see theorem 1 on p.  224 of @xcite , and the definition immediately preceding it ) .",
    "a detailed exposition appears in @xcite*5 ; see especially  5.6 of _ loc .",
    "_ an analogous result is used by waldspurger in his computation of shalika germs for @xmath6 ( see @xcite*5 ) .    in @xcite , hales defines absolute semisimplicity and topological unipotence ( the analogues of -semisimplicity and -unipotence ) for elements of unramified groups , and shows that every strongly compact element can be decomposed as a commuting product of an absolutely semisimple and a topologically unipotent element ( the topological jordan decomposition ) .",
    "he then defines transfer factors on unramified groups , and shows that the transfer factor at a strongly compact element may be expressed in terms of the transfer factor for the centraliser of its absolutely semisimple part , evaluated at its topologically unipotent part ( see theorem 10.18 and lemma 13.2 of _ loc .",
    "this suggests that the topological jordan decomposition is important for the fundamental lemma .",
    "indeed , in @xcite , flicker uses a twisted analogue of the decomposition to prove a special case of the fundamental lemma ( see the theorem on p.  509 of _ loc .",
    "the topological jordan decomposition is also useful in character computations .",
    "recall that the character of a deligne  lusztig representation of a finite group of lie type is expressed by a reduction formula in terms of the ( ordinary ) jordan decomposition ( see theorem 4.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the topological jordan decomposition plays the same rle for the characters of depth - zero supercuspidal representations of @xmath0-adic groups arising via compact induction from representations which are inflations of deligne  lusztig representations of reductive quotients ( see lemma 10.0.4 of @xcite ) .    in @xcite* , as preparation for the ( positive - depth ) character computations of @xcite , adler and the author define the notion of a _ normal approximation _ of an element of a reductive @xmath0-adic group , a refinement of the topological jordan decomposition .",
    "however , for the results of that paper , one needs notions of absolute semisimplicity and topological unipotence that make sense over a discretely valued field @xmath2 which is not necessarily locally compact .",
    "in this paper , we offer two generalisations of these notions , the first an abstract one adapted to profinite groups , and the second adapted to the setting in which we are most interested , of reductive groups over discretely valued fields @xmath2 as above .",
    "we prove the usual existence ( propositions [ prop : intrinsic - tu ] and [ prop : tjd = cpct ] ) and uniqueness ( propositions [ prop : unique - top - p - jordan ] and [ prop : unique - top - f - jordan ] ) results for these decompositions .",
    "in the familiar case where @xmath2 is locally compact , these definitions have significant overlap ; see , for example , lemmata [ lem : top - unip ] , [ lem : abs - ss ] , and [ lem : top - jordan ] .",
    "our main result , theorem [ thm : top - f - jordan - projects ] , is a strong existence result which is the analogue of item ( 7 ) in the list of properties of topological jordan decompositions given in @xcite*3 .",
    "an important ingredient in its proof is an analogue of a fixed - point result of prasad and yu ( see proposition [ prop : x - depth ] ) .",
    "this work has its origins in discussions with jeffrey adler during the writing of @xcite .",
