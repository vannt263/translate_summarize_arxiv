    "describing the evolution from a metal to a mott insulator as the strength of electron correlations is increased has challenged condensed matter theorists for the last many decades .",
    "part of the difficulty is due to a complicated interplay between the metal - insulator transition and magnetic ordering that appears commonly in the insulator .",
    "however in recent years evidence , both theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite , has accumulated for the existence of a possible quantum spin liquid mott state just on the insulating side of the mott transition in frustrated lattices .",
    "such a state does not break spin rotation or any other microscopic symmetries .",
    "thus there is an opportunity to study the fundamental phenomenon of the mott metal - insulator transition without the complications of magnetism or other broken symmetries .",
    "a theoretical description of the vicinity of the mott transition is challenged by the need to describe the kinetic and interaction energies of the electrons on more or less equal footing . in the last two decades",
    "there has been great progress in studying the mott transition in spatial dimension @xmath1 through dynamical mean field theory@xcite . however in this limit the resulting mott insulator has at zero temperature no correlations between the spins and hence has non - zero entropy .",
    "thus the @xmath2 results may at best be a guide for the somewhat high temperature physics in the vicinity of the mott transition .",
    "the mott transition can also be described using slave particle methods .",
    "a complete theory for a continuous mott transition from a fermi liquid metal to a quantum spin liquid mott insulator in two space dimensions was described in ref . by studying fluctuations on top of the slave particle mean field theory of ref . .",
    "in this description the mott insulator is a quantum spin liquid state with gapless spin excitations . as this transition",
    "is approached from the metal the entire fermi surface disappears _",
    "continuously_. the resulting critical point is characterized by the presence of a gapless ` critical fermi surface ' @xcite where the fermi surface is sharp but there are no landau quasiparticles .",
    "these results have also been generalized to three space dimensions@xcite .        in this paper",
    "we develop a way of thinking about the electronic mott transition in two space dimensions that starts with the low energy effective theory of the fermi liquid phase .",
    "this is of course just the familiar landau theory of fermi liquids@xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic description of the low energy properties of a fermi liquid is in terms of the kinetic equation for the _ local _ quasiparticle distribution function .",
    "this hydrodynamic theory may be usefully viewed as a theory of shape fluctuations of the fermi surface@xcite ( see fig . [",
    "fig : smooth ] ) . in the low energy limit a local version of luttinger s theorem@xcite",
    "is obeyed so that a local shape fluctuation of the fermi surface which changes the area leads to a change of particle density ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : breath ] ) .",
    "similarly a local shift of the  center of mass \" of the fermi surface corresponds to a non - zero current density ( see fig . [",
    "fig : breath ] ) . as the mott transition",
    "is approached the minimal thing that needs to happen is that long wavelength fluctuations in the local charge and current densities are suppressed .",
    "our goal in this paper is to explore the nature of the mott insulator and the transition when the fermi surface shape fluctuations associated with charge and current density fluctuations are suppressed without making any a priori assumptions about the fate of other shape fluctuations .    ) of the fermi surface .",
    "b : density fluctuation ( @xmath3 ) of the fermi surface.,width=321 ]    we will do this by relying crucially on key insights from the theory of the mott transition of bosons .",
    "in contrast to electronic systems , the mott transition of interacting bosons is rather well understood theoretically@xcite .",
    "the liquid phase of bosons has superfluid long range order , and the corresponding hydrodynamic theory describes the gapless sound mode associated with superfluid order . accessing a mott insulator of bosons from the superfluid phase requires condensing vortex configurations of the superfluid order parameter .",
    "this enforces the quantization of particle number that is crucial for the existence of a mott insulator .    motivated by this",
    ", we develop an alternate ` dual ' way of thinking about the _",
    "electronic _ mott transition and the resulting spin liquid mott insulator .",
    "we first identify a degree of freedom in the hydrodynamic description of the conducting state that plays the role of a vortex in the phase of the electron operator .",
    "we show that condensing these vortices leads to an incompressible mott insulator .",
    "specifically it clamps down long distance , long time fluctuations of the particle number and current densities .",
    "the resulting mott insulator is in a quantum spin liquid state and has gapless excitations .",
    "interestingly it is a spin liquid with a fermi surface of charge neutral spin-@xmath4 fermionic spinons coupled to a fluctuating @xmath0 gauge field .",
    "usually spin liquids with emergent spinons and gauge fields are described by slave particle constructions@xcite .",
    "the route to a spin liquid described in this paper is very different and does not explicitly rely on any slave particle description .",
    "it thus provides an alternate point of view of the spinon fermi surface state that may potentially be useful in thinking about it .",
    "we also briefly discuss a phase obtained by condensing vortices in a phase that is conjugate to spin antisymmetric distortions of the fermi surface .",
    "this results in a spin gapped metal with a charge fermi surface which can also be alternately described in terms of slave particles .",
    "consider , for concreteness , the boson hubbard model on , say , a two dimensional lattice with an integer number @xmath5 of bosons per site on average : @xmath6 where @xmath7 creates a boson at site @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the boson number at site @xmath8 . if @xmath10 the ground state is a mott insulator while in the opposite limit @xmath11 a superfluid state results .",
    "the superfluid - mott phase transition is described@xcite by a standard ( quantum ) landau - ginzburg action for the superfluid order parameter in @xmath12 space - time dimensions .    for our purposes",
    "it is insightful to understand how to think about the mott insulator and the transition to it within in a conceptual framework that begins in the superfluid phase .",
    "deep in the superfluid state the appropriate low energy effective theory of the superfluid phase is simply given by the harmonic ( euclidean ) action @xmath13 for the phase @xmath14 of the superfluid order parameter ( @xmath15 ) . here",
    "@xmath16 and we have set the sound velocity to @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is the phase stiffness .",
    "a key point is to recognize that this  phase - only \" description has no hope of describing the mott insulator .",
    "this is because the harmonic phase - only theory does not know about the quantization of the conjugate particle number .",
    "this quantization is crucial in obtaining the mott insulator .",
    "quantization of the particle number is equivalent to the condition that the boson phase be defined mod @xmath19 .",
    "thus it is important to include vortices in the phase field and condense them to obtain a description of the mott insulator .",
    "as is well known@xcite this is conveniently described through a duality transformation where we regard the gapless linearly dispersing sound wave as a transverse photon of a @xmath0 gauge field .",
    "formally @xmath20 vortices in @xmath14 act as sources for the dual vector potential @xmath21 , and can be easily incorporated as a boson field that couples minimally to @xmath21 . the full dual action including a vortex field @xmath22 is @xmath23 in the superfluid phase the vortices are gapped and may be integrated out to reproduce the dual of the low energy sound wave action .",
    "the mott insulator is obtained when the vortices condense .",
    "this gaps out the gauge field , and quantizes the dual magnetic flux which is the particle number of the original bosons .",
    "the dual vortex action is well known to be equivalent to the landau - ginzburg description of the mott transition in terms of the boson order parameter @xmath24 .",
    "so now consider the electronic hubbard model at half - filling on a non - bipartite lattice in two space dimensions : @xmath25 where @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) creates a spinful electron at site @xmath8 and @xmath28 is the electron number at site @xmath8 . for @xmath29",
    "a fermi liquid results with a sharp fermi surface satisfying luttinger s theorem . for @xmath10 on the other hand a mott insulator obtains . at very large @xmath30 the low energy physics of the mott insulator may be described as a spin model and will often have magnetic long range order .",
    "however we will specifically be interested in the ` weak ' mott insulator that obtains just on the insulating side of the mott transition .",
    "it seems likely , for instance on a triangular lattice , that such a weak mott insulator will be in a quantum spin liquid state with no magnetism or other broken symmetries @xcite .",
    "it is interesting , in the fermionic version of the problem , to start again with the low energy effective theory of the conducting phase and understand what needs to be done to access a mott insulator",
    ". in the fermionic case , as the conducting phase ( for @xmath29 ) is just the fermi liquid , the corresponding low energy effective theory is fermi liquid theory .",
    "analogously to the bosonic example , the landau fermi liquid action by itself does not contain within it the mott insulator that obtains with increasing @xmath30 .",
    "we may then ask if there are special configurations ( analogous to the vortices in the boson example ) that have to be included and whose condensation can lead to the mott insulator . the analogy with bosons",
    "may be sharpened somewhat by noticing that fermi liquid theory is essentially a quadratic hydrodynamic theory for the density of fermions at each point of the fermi surface .",
    "( for bosons the hydrodynamic mode is just the conserved total density and the quadratic phase theory just describes fluctuations of this mode .",
    "in contrast for fermions the fermi liquid ` fixed point ' has emergent conservation laws corresponding to the number of fermions at each point of the fermi surface@xcite , and the corresponding densities are emergent hydrodynamic modes that are included in the landau fermi liquid description ) .",
    "furthermore this is equivalent@xcite to a quadratic ` phase ' based description in terms of the phase of the fermion operator at any given point @xmath31 of the two dimensional fermi surface .",
    "this quadratic phase action is a higher dimensional generalization@xcite of the familiar bosonization from one spatial dimension .",
    "however in contrast to the one dimensional example the bosonized fermi surface theory in higher dimensions is simply a rewrite of landau fermi liquid theory .    for the purposes of accessing a mott insulator , it seems most interesting to explore a slightly different point of view on the fermi liquid . as emphasized in the literature@xcite , the quadratic hydrodynamic theory for the emergent conserved densities of the @xmath31-movers ( _ i.e. _ fermions associated with an angle @xmath31 on the fermi surface )",
    "is a theory of harmonic fluctuations of the _ shape _ of the fermi surface ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : smooth ] ) .",
    "the fluctuations of the _ total density _ are simply determined by the fluctuations in the area of the fermi surface ( with the assumption@xcite that long wavelength fluctuations locally satisfy luttinger s theorem ) . clearly to access the mott insulator a description where the quantization of particle number is incorporated is necessary . by analogy with bosons",
    "we may then expect that we need to include vortices in the phase variable that is conjugate to the total particle density .",
    "this conjugate phase variable is readily identified in the bosonized phase description of the fermi liquid ( as a suitable linear combination of the phase of the various @xmath31-movers ) .",

    "the structure of the low energy effective theory for the mott insulator is simply that of fermions at a fermi surface coupled minimally to the fluctuating gauge field @xmath118 . the corresponding action may be taken to be @xmath161 & = & \\bar{f_\\alpha}\\left ( \\partial_\\tau - \\mathrm{i}a_0 - \\mu - \\frac{\\left({\\boldsymbol{\\nabla } } - \\mathrm{i}{\\boldsymbol{a}}\\right)^2}{2 m } \\right)f_\\alpha \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{k}{2}\\left(\\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\lambda } \\partial_\\nu a_\\lambda \\right)^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] clearly the @xmath162 field should be interpreted as a spinon , and the mott insulator we obtain is described at low energies as a spin liquid with a spinon fermi surface that is coupled minimally to a fluctuating @xmath0 gauge field .",
    "this is the same result as that obtained within the standard slave particle treatment of the mott transition@xcite .",
    "however we have reached it through a very different route that never involved splitting the electron into a product of slave particle operators .",
    "thus our approach provides an alternate point of view on the spinon fermi surface spin liquid mott insulator that adds to our understanding of it .",
    "let us pursue a bit more this connection between the approach we have taken in this paper and the standard slave particle description of this spin liquid mott insulator .",
    "we see that the chargon / holon operator of the slave particle formalism should be identified with @xmath163 , _",
    "i.e. _ the holon / chargon phase is essentially the @xmath86 component of the charge boson .",
    "the bosonized version of the spinon field with spin @xmath52 at angle @xmath31 on the fermi surface is simply @xmath164 .",
    "finally the magnetic flux of the emergent gauge field of the spin liquid is simply the density of the vortex field @xmath22 .    in the slave particle approach the internal gauge field is compact .",
    "the compactness means that  instanton \" events where the gauge flux changes by @xmath19 are microscopically allowed .",
    "it has now been established that in two dimensional spin liquids with sufficient number of gapless spinon modes these instanton events are supressed at low energies so that the compactness can be ignored in the low energy effective theory of the spin liquid phase@xcite .",
    "how does this manifest itself in our approach ?",
    "since the magnetic flux of the emergent gauge field corresponds to the density of vortices , these instanton events correspond precisely to processes where the vortex decays and disappears .",
    "this is exactly what one expects in the fermi liquid phase .",
    "as we discussed a vortex corresponds to a pattern of swirling current and in the fermi liquid phase it will decay into a shower of particle - hole pairs .",
    "this decay process of the vortex is actually not included in our effective dual action .",
    "however as we know that the instanton events are suppressed in the spin liquid phase and right at the mott transition we are justified a posteriori in ignoring this vortex decay .",
    "in this section we briefly digress and consider the natural question of what happens if we condense the vortex in the spin rather than in the charge boson .",
    "specifically let us define the zero angular momentum component of the spin boson : @xmath165 it is easy to see that @xmath166 is conjugate to ( twice ) the @xmath167-component of the spin density @xmath168 : @xmath169 = \\frac{\\mathrm{i}}{2\\pi}\\delta^{(2)}({\\boldsymbol{x } } - { \\boldsymbol{y}})\\ ] ] we can now contemplate phases in which fluctuations of the spin density and the spin current are clamped .",
    "this is achieved by condensing vortices in @xmath170 . repeating the analysis of the previous section",
    "we see that the resulting paramagnet has ( after refermionization ) two species of fermions @xmath171 at the original fermi surface that are coupled to an emergent @xmath0 gauge field with opposite gauge charges : @xmath172 this is an example of a spin - gapped ",
    "algebraic charge liquid \" metal@xcite analogous to the holon metal that has been discussed in the context of doped mott insulators .",
    "the coupling to the gauge field ultimate drives a pairing instability and the ground state will be superconducting .",
    "nevertheless the spin gapped metallic ground state can be exposed if a magnetic field that suppresses superconductivity is present .",
    "the theoretical aproach described in this paper to the mott transition immediately invites the question on whether more exotic phases may be accessed by condensing vortices in higher angular momentum channels .",
    "could we for instance introduce and condense vortices in the @xmath173 channel of the charge boson , _",
    "i.e. _ in @xmath174 ?",
    "the field @xmath175 is conjugate to a @xmath173 distortion of the fermi surface .",
    "such a vortex condensate would have rather exotic properties : it will be a compressible metal which is nevertheless  incompressible \" for such a @xmath173 fermi surface distortion .",
    "furthermore the single particle spectrum will be gapped almost everywhere on the fermi surface as adding an electron at a generic @xmath50-point necessarily couples in with the gapped @xmath173 fermi surface distortion mode .    despite the appeal of describing such an exotic metal",
    "very simply it is not clear to us that it is legitimate to ever introduce such higher angular momentum vortices and study their condensation .",
    "the difficulty is as follows . to talk about vortices in some field",
    "it is important that it be a periodic variable .",
    "this in turn means that the physical hilbert space is such that the conjugate variable is quantized to be an integer multiple of some basic unit . for the @xmath86 charge or spin boson",
    "the conjugate variables are the total charge and spin densities respectively .",
    "their spatial integrals can of course only take quantized values . consequently @xmath176 are periodic variables and it is legitimate to study vortex defects . for the higher-@xmath128 modes",
    "however , the conjugate variables are various shape distortions of the fermi surface which in the microscopic hilbert space are not quantized .",
    "consequently @xmath124 or @xmath177 for @xmath178 should not be regarded as a periodic variable , and there is no obvious sense in defining vortices in these fields .",
    "in this paper we described a new approach to thinking about the electronic mott transition on a two dimensional lattice between a fermi liquid metal and a quantum spin liquid mott insulator .",
    "we started with the effective low energy theory of the fermi liquid viewed as a theory of shape fluctuations of the fermi surface .",
    "the mott transition must involve suppression of shape fluctuations that correspond to density and current fluctuations . to implement this suppression , and based on insights from the theory of the mott transition of bosons , we incorporated vortices in the electron phase into the bosonized description of the low energy description of a fermi liquid .",
    "condensing these vortices gives us a mott insulator .",
    "we showed that the low energy effective theory of this mott insulator has a spinon fermi surface coupled to a fluctuating @xmath0 gauge field .",
    "this is the same result as in the usual slave particle description of the mott transition even though our approach is very different and did not explicitly invoke slave particles .",
    "we also showed how we could obtain a description of a spin gapped metal with a charge fermi surface by condensing vortices in the phase of the variable conjugate to the spin antisymmetric shape fluctuations of the fermi surface .",
    "such a state too has a well - known description in terms of slave particles .    when compared to slave particle theories our approach is more coarse - grained",
    ". we keep only degrees of freedom near the fermi surface and see how to change their dynamics so that the fermi liquid is destroyed in favor of a mott insulator or a spin gapped metal .",
    "thus we keep the momentum space structure of the fermi liquid while incorporating the minimum possible correlation effects needed to describe the mott insulator .",
    "in contrast the slave particle approach is very much a real space construct , and momentum space structure is introduced by first doing a mean field calculation to obtain a fermi surface for slave fermions . by providing an alternate point of view",
    "we hope that our approach gives additional insight into the novel physics associated with the mott transition and the quantum spin liquid state .",
    "in particular , our methods may provide a framework for thinking about phenomena such as the  momentum - selective mott transitions \" @xcite suggested by various cluster extensions of dmft , or to describe exotic phases beyond what is accessible within a slave particle framework .",
    "we leave exploration of such possibilities for the future .",

    "for clarity we will demonstrate the calculation of the commutator @xmath179 $ ] in the non - interacting case @xmath180 .",
    "it should be clear however that the commutator is independent of @xmath181 since it is determined exclusively by the time - derivative terms in the action , while @xmath181 only appears with spatial derivatives of the fields .",

    "it has been shown that , in the long - wavelength limit , the fermion correlator is unaffected by a non - singular @xmath181 , so again we set it to zero for simplicity .",
    "it is then straightforward to compute @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the size of the system and @xmath188 the momentum cut - off normal to the fermi surface .",
    "we have now determined the fermion correlator @xmath189 where we have taken the thermodynamic limit @xmath190 . via the same point - splitting procedure as above",
    ", it is easily verified that the fermion operators satisfy anti - commutation relations .",
    "in the main text we point out that a bit of care is required when coupling a gauge field to or isolating vortices from the bosonized theory . to illustrate the issue and its resolution , here we briefly discuss the 1-dimensional case , which may be more familiar to the reader .",

    "e.g. _ by calculating the charge - density operator @xmath194 while we know that the correct charge and current operators are given by @xmath195 this is not surprising .",
