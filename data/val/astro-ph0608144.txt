    "the effective areas can be as large as 200  @xmath9 in some energy regions . using these high - quality spectra",
    ", physical conditions of stellar coronae such as electron density , thermal structure , and element abundances , can be derived .",
    "such information further helps to constrain models of the coronal heating and structuring . in the past ,",
    "the information about the spatial distribution of coronal plasma was inferred by indirect means such as modelling of eclipses and rotational modulation ( g@xmath10del et al . , 1995 , 2003 ; siarkowski et al . , 1996 ) , and such analyses can only be carried out for very special systems with advantageous geometries .",
    "presently , the electron density ( @xmath2 ) of stellar coronae can be disentangled from the emission measure ( @xmath11 ) , and determined separately using the x - ray spectra with high - resolution for various late - type stars .",

    "( 2004 ) further estimated the sizes of stellar x - ray coronae , and concluded that the cooler plasma component can not cover a large fraction of the stellar surface , and there must be spatially separate plasma components at different temperatures .",
    "they also argued that the hotter plasma loops fill the space between cooler loops until much of the corona is dominated by the hotter plasma .",
    "the parameter of the electron density is also used to judge the mechanism of the x - ray production . for t",
    "tauri stars , a density of @xmath24  @xmath4 has been obtained from o  vii for tw  hya ( stelzer & schmitt , 2004 ) and bp  tau ( schmitt et al . , 2005 ) , which is higher than typical coronal densities by at least two orders of magnitude .",
    "it was assumed that the x - ray emission is produced in the accretion shocks of t  tauri stars , instead of stellar coronae .",
    "additionally , the uv radiative field from the inner layer also plays an important role on the population of levels @xmath25 , which directly influences the estimation of @xmath2 . for lighter elements ,",
    "this effect is more sever ( ness et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "in the coronal x - ray spectra , in addition of the emissions of h- , he - like ions and fe l - shell ions , many lines from highly charged silicon have been observed in the letgs observations , such as that of procyon .",

    ", we found the ratio between two group of @xmath1 transition lines , the 55.246 to 55.346 ( the values refer to the resolvable observed wavelengths in table 2 ) , is sensitive to @xmath2 , as shown in fig.3 .",

    "we also note that the emissivity of si  ix line at 61.696 is @xmath700.18 relative to that of 61.649 line , so we attribute it to be the possible emission at 61.702 , whereas raassen et al .",

    "2006a ) , we derived a density of 2.6@xmath3  @xmath4 for the cooler plasma of procyon , using lines of si  x. using the electron temperature and density , as well as em and the element abundance estimated by raassen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for letgs observation of procyon , we calculate the theoretical line fluxes as listed in table 2 .",
    "the differences between the prediction and observation of line fluxes are primarily from the uncertainty of the element abundance , because their result is from the global fitting of the procyon spectrum .",

    "the comparison reveals that the three identified wavelengths around 55.346 appear to have slight more separation in wavelengths , which result in the theoretical spectrum appears broader at this position .",
    "this may be from the uncertainty of the atomic data , although the upper levels for these transitions are from nist .",
    "for line at 55.083 , raassen et al .",

    ", we obtain the observed value ( 5.2@xmath370.11 ) for the ratio @xmath66 .",
    "the comparison of the predicted @xmath66 with the observed value indicates that the electron density is about @xmath74@xmath4 in the line emitting region .    in collision ionization equilibrium ( mazzotta et al .",
    "1998 ) , the peak temperature ( 1.26mk ) of si  ix fraction is close to the @xmath68 determined from h- and he - like carbon ions .",
    "therefore , the densities determined by the two different methods should be comparable .",
    "however , the radiation effect from procyon s photosphere has great influence on the estimation of @xmath2 using the triplet ratio of he - like carbon . when this effect has been considered , an upper limit of @xmath75@xmath4 was obtained ( ness et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the combination of the two results definitely gives the density range for the cooler x - ray emitting region .",
    "this ratio can also be used to diagnose the @xmath2 for those c - depleted stars , such as algol",
    ".      ratios of emission with small oscillator strength @xmath16 _ vs _ emission with large oscillator strength have been used to detect resonant scattering .",
    "for example , the ratio of the @xmath5 line of fe  xvii at 16.78 ( @xmath76=0.01 ) to @xmath1 line at 15.03 ( @xmath76=2.66 ) has been used to infer the effects of resonant scattering , because even the most complete model of doron & behar ( 2002 ) do not agree with the observations , such as the flare observation of ab  doradus ( matranga et al .",
    "large discrepancies in the predicted and observed ratios for similar lines in fe  xviii and fe  xix have also been reported by desai et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "in procyon , two resolved @xmath5 lines have been identified in the work of raassen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . however , the identification is not conclusive due to the uncertainty of atomic data . here",
    "we make a detailed analyses for these possible @xmath5 emissions . for the emission at 61.611",
    ", the previous subsection has revealed that a fraction of the observed flux originates from the emission of s  viii line at 61.645 . in order to subtract the contribution of s  viii emission line , we adopt the experimental line intensity ratio ( 0.75 ) between 61.645 and 52.781 , measured in ebit facility by lepson et al .",
    "the observed flux of the obvious emission around 52.780 is 0.39@xmath28phot.@xmath30s@xmath29 .",
    "so s  viii occupies @xmath7039% around 61.611 . by taking into account this blending , the observed intensity at 61.611",
    "is 0.21@xmath71 relative to that of the line 55.346 as shown by the circle symbol in fig .  4 , which is slightly higher than the prediction over a large range of density .",
    "however , they agree within 2@xmath32 statistical errors .",
    "for the other two emissions at 61.702 and 61.846 , only the features of si  ix from @xmath5 transitions at 61.696 and 61.844 can be found in the present prediction and available database such as apec and mekal . when the line intensities are normalized to that of 55.346 line , the observed ratios are significantly higher than the theoretical prediction ( solid line ) by an order of magnitude in typical coronal conditions , as shown by square and diamond symbols with @xmath77 error in fig .",
    "a search in the astrophysical emission code ( apec with version of 1.3.1 ) also indicates the emissivities of si  ix lines are the strongest .",
    "so the differences must be attributed to other explanations .",
    "the first thought is that whether the discrepancies are due to the contaminations from high - order spectral lines . in the spectrum of procyon ,",
    "no second- and third - order spectral lines of prominent lines in short wavelength range ( @xmath7830 ) lie in this wavelength region .",
    "this encourages us to consider the incompleteness of model and/or the opacity effect . in the case of fe",
    "xvii , doron & behar ( 2002 ) considered the effects of recombination , resonance excitation and ionization processes on the level populations , and made the theoretical prediction increase by 50% .",
    "the correct results shown a better agreement with observed ones for most stellar coronae . in the case of si  ix , observed ratio at 61.611 can agree with the prediction within @xmath77 uncertainty , if the indirect processes have a similar effect as in fe  xvii .",
    "for the other two possible @xmath5 emissions , the discrepancies being up to an order of magnitude , can not be explained by the complete model . as suggested by ness et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the opacity effect is also not possible to be detected from the integrated spectrum for normal stars .",
    "so we suggest that the most possible reason might be the contamination of unknown emissions .",
    "a detailed analysis of soft x - ray emissions of carbon - like silicon reveals that the ratio of si  ix lines around 55.246 and 55.346   is a good @xmath2-diagnostic method . by comparing the observed ratio with theoretical prediction , a lower limit of the density ( 0.6@xmath3  @xmath4 ) was obtained for procyon , which is the typical value of the solar quiescent corona .",
    "the constructed spectrum of si  ix suggests that the major contribution at 55.083 , and 61.611 should be assigned to si  ix .    in intensity ratios of @xmath5 transition lines of si",
    "ix relative to that of @xmath1 line at 55.346   , significant discrepancies between observations and theoretical predictions are found in procyon .",
    "for the @xmath5 line at 61.611   , the observation and theoretical prediction agree within a factor of 2 , when the contamination arising from s  viii line ( 61.645   ) has been considered . here ,",
    "an experimental ratio of 0.75 ( lepson et al . 2005 ) between s  viii lines at 61.645 and 52.781   was adopted to disentangle the blending .",
    "however , for other two possible @xmath5 lines of 61.792 and 61.848   , large differences ( nearly an order of magnitude ) can not be explained by the uncertainty of atomic data and the resonant scatter effect .",
    "so we suggest that the most possible reason is contributions of unknown emissions , which may be addressed by further improvements in the soft x - ray spectral analysis .",
