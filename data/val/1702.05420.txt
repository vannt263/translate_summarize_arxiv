    "the human operator has been treated as a passive component and then control architectures have been established while ensuring closed - loop stability based upon this assumption .",

    "@xcite , where stability is ensured in the presence of split and join events .",
    "other interesting extensions of bilateral teleoperation are presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "varnell and zhang @xcite employ a non - classical human - robot interfaces , namely a tablet , and discuss the stability while assuming a human pointing model .",
    "saeidi et al .",
    "@xcite introduce the notion of robot - to - human trust and mixed initiative control scheme in order to improve the performance and reduce workload of the operator .",
    "while the above papers consider robot dynamics together with force feedback , the authors @xcite studied another problem formulation focusing on interactions between a human operator and kinematic robots as in @xcite .",
    "the schematic of the intended system is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scenario ] .",
    "then , we investigated motion synchronization of robots to human references under distributed information exchange between the human and robots , and among robots . to this end , we presented a novel passivity - based control architecture and proved synchronization under explicit bilateral connections between the human and robotic network .",
    "for implementation on real robotic systems , both the human - robotic network and inter - robot interactions must be implemented using appropriate communication technology . in this case",
    ", the communication channels may suffer from delays in the transmission of information , which is indeed one of the most important issues in bilateral teleoperation .",
    "however , @xcite did not address this issue explicitly .",
    "our objective is thus to extend the results of @xcite to the case with time delays and its experimental studies .",
    "although both the human - robotic network and inter - robot communications may have delays , this paper investigates the latter since this issue emerges in the one - human - multiple - robot interactions while the former has been in - depth studied in bilateral teleoperation .",
    "delays in inter - robot communications have been extensively studied in the field of cooperative control ( see @xcite and references therein ) . among many approaches ,",
    "this paper focuses on the scheme presented in @xcite , and synchronization is guaranteed despite the delays . in this paper , the control architecture in @xcite",
    "is shown to be successfully integrated with the cooperative control for human - robotic networks presented in @xcite .",
    "however , the integration is not straightforward and requires novel technical extensions in the formulation and this is presented in this paper .",
    "furthermore , as pointed out in @xcite , real deployments of robotic network is important from the viewpoint of difficulties to simulate each intended task and situation faithfully .",
    "therefore , we investigate our proposed architecture in a testbed and show the influences of communication delays not only on a robotic network but also on a real human s behaviour .    the organization of this paper is as follows : section [ sec : problem ] presents the intended problem and briefly reviews the results of @xcite . in section [ sec : hrn ] , we design a novel control architecture based on the scattering transformation @xcite , and then , show passivity of the resulted system .",
    "we also show position synchronization to the reference values in section [ sec : main ] .",
    "we demonstrate our results through experiments in section [ sec : experiment ] , and finally , summarize the obtained results in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we start by reviewing the problem formulation and results presented in @xcite",
    ". please refer to @xcite for more details .",
    "let us consider a system with a human operator and @xmath0 mobile robots @xmath1 located on a 2-d plane as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scenario ] .",
    "we suppose that the motion of every @xmath2-th robot is described by the kinematic model @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the position and velocity input of @xmath2-th robot , respectively .    every robot can interact with neighboring robots and the inter - robot information exchanges are modeled by a graph @xmath6",
    ". then , robot @xmath2 has access to information of the robots belonging to the set @xmath7 . throughout this paper , we assume the communication graph is fixed , undirected and connected . differently from @xcite , we assume that the inter - robot communication suffers from time delays , which will be discussed in section [ sec : problem ] .",
    "in addition to the total robots set @xmath8 , we define accessible robots set @xmath9 which is a subset of @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scenarioblock ] ) .",
    "_ accessibility _ means that the operator can send a signal to and receive feedback information from only the robots in @xmath9 . here",
    ", we assume that the human operator determines a command signal @xmath10 based on certain information @xmath11 visually fed back from @xmath9 through a monitor in front of the operator . the command @xmath12 is then sent back to all the accessible robots .",
    "we also introduce the notation @xmath13 such that @xmath14 if @xmath15 and @xmath16 otherwise .    in this paper , we address position synchronization .",
    "let us assume that the human operator has a desired position denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "then , the goal of the position synchronization is defined by @xmath18 the objective here is to design the robot controller @xmath19 and the information @xmath11 displayed on the monitor so as to guarantee the above control goal .",
    "the authors @xcite take the control input @xmath19 as @xmath20 then , the signal @xmath21 to achieve inter - agent motion synchronization is designed as @xmath22 where @xmath23 @xmath24 , @xmath25 if @xmath26 and @xmath27 otherwise .",
    "then , the collective dynamics ( [ eq : integrator ] ) , ( [ eqn : hata ] ) and ( [ eq : uriorig ] ) for all @xmath2 is passive from @xmath10 to @xmath28 , where @xmath28 is defined as @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the number of elements of @xmath9 .",
    "based on this passivity , we let the feedback information @xmath11 for the human operator be @xmath31 .",
    "namely , the human operator can obtain the average position of the accessible robots @xmath28 . in @xcite , position synchronization",
    "is theoretically proved in the absence of delays under a passivity assumption on the human s decision process together with some additional assumptions .",
    "however , inter - robot communication delays may destabilize the above control system .",
    "this is why we present a system architecture with robustness against inter - robot communication delays .",
    "the system architecture ( [ eq : xiorig ] ) , ( [ eq : uriorig ] ) can achieve not only position synchronization but also synchronization of velocity at the same time , i.e. , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a constant reference velocity .",
