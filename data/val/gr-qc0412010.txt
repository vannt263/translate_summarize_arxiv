    "we separate the evolution of a binary system into three phases : _ point - like inspiral _ where orbital separation is much larger than the neutron star radius , _ hydrostationary inspiral _ where orbital separation is just a few times larger than the radius of the neutron star so that hydrodynamics play an important role , and _ merger _ in which the two stars coalesce dynamically .",

    ", all relativistic calculations ( except those of @xcite ) of the last orbits of inspiral phase have been done for the simplified eos of dense matter - the polytropic eos . in the paper we present results of our studies on late stage of inspiral of binary systems containing equal mass compact stars described by different realistic eos of dense matter .",
    "the calculations are performed in the framework of _ isenberg - wilson - mathews _ approximation to general relativity ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "we consider binary systems consisting of two identical stars .",
    "we choose the gravitational mass of each star to be @xmath4 at infinite separation in order to be consistent with recent population synthesis calculations @xcite and with the current set of well - measured neutron star masses in relativistic binary radio pulsars @xcite .",
    "we assume that the velocity flow in the stellar interiors is irrotational ( the fluid has zero vorticity in the inertial frame ) since the viscosity of neutron star matter ( or strange star matter ) is far too low to ensure synchronization during the late stage of the inspiral @xcite .",
    "in fig . 1 we show gravitational mass versus stellar radius for sequences of static compact stars .",
    "we limit ourselves to neutron stars consisting of nucleons and hyperons and strange quark stars described by the mit bag model . depending on the eos",

    "the neutron star crust is described by means of a realistic eos obtained in the many - body calculations ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we note that the equations of state of nuclear matter can be considered static , as the timescales for bulk processes such as viscosity is much longer than the last stages of inspiral considered here .     versus stellar radius @xmath6 for sequences of static neutron stars described by three different nuclear equations of state ( solid lines ) and strange quark stars described by different mit bag models ( dashed lines ) .",
    ", width=491 ]    strange stars are currently considered as a possible alternative to neutron stars as compact objects ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "typically , they are modeled with an eos based on the mit - bag model in which quark confinement is described by an energy term proportional to the volume ( e.g. @xcite ) in which quark confinement is described by an energy term proportional to the volume @xcite .",
    "there are three physical quantities entering the mit - bag model : the mass of the strange quarks , @xmath7 , the bag constant , @xmath8 , and the strength of the qcd coupling constant @xmath9 . in the framework of this model the quark matter is composed of massless u , d quarks , massive s quarks and electrons .",
    "strange stars are self - bound objects , having high density ( in the range @xmath10 $ ] @xcite ) at the surface . dashed lines in fig . 1 correspond to sequences of static strange quark stars described by three different sets of parameters of the mit - bag model : * sqs56 * - the standard mit bag model : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ; * sqsb60 * - the simplified mit bag model with @xmath14 , @xmath15 ; @xmath16 ; * sqsb40 * - the  extreme  mit bag model ( relatively low strange quark mass and @xmath8 but high @xmath9 ) : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "in the inspiral phase , since the timescale of orbital shrinking due to the emission of gravitational waves is longer than the orbital period , one may consider a binary system to be in a quasi - equilibrium state ( helical killing vector approximation ) .",
    "for each eos , we construct so called an _ evolutionary sequence _ by calculating a sequence of quasi - equilibrium configurations with fixed baryon mass and decreasing orbital separation .",
    "we assume that the timescale in which the neutron star adjusts to the current gravitational potential is much shorter that the timescale of the orbital shrinking .",
    "the present computations of close binary neutron star or strange star systems rely on the assumption of irrotational flow of the fluid and a conformally flat spatial 3-metric ( isenberg - wilson - mathews approximation ) . in order to calculate the last orbits of inspiral phase of binary compact stars we use a numerical code which solves the",
    "five coupled , nonlinear , elliptic equations for the gravitational field , supplemented by an elliptic equation for the velocity potential of irrotational flows ( see@xcite for a discussion on different boundary conditions in the case of strange stars and neutron stars ) . the code has been already used successfully for calculating the final phase of the inspiral of compact stars @xcite .",
    "this code is built upon the c++ library lorene ( http://www.lorene.obspm.fr ) .",
    "the complete description of the resulting general relativistic equations , the whole algorithm , as well numerous tests of the code can be found in @xcite .",
    "additional tests have been presented in sect .",
    "iii of @xcite .",
    "in fig . 2 we show the evolution of equal mass binary neutron stars ( solid lines ) and strange stars ( dashed lines ) having total gravitational mass @xmath20 at infinity .",
    "the binding energy @xmath21 is defined as the difference between @xmath22 ( arnowitt - deser - misner mass - the total mass - energy of a binary system @xcite ) and the total mass of the system at infinite separation .",
    "this energy is equal to total energy emitted by a binary system in gravitational waves .",
    "the frequency of gravitational waves is twice the orbital frequency .",
    "comparison of our numerical results with 3rd order pn point masses calculations @xcite reveals a good agreement for small frequencies ( large separations ) .",
    "the deviation from pn curves at higher frequencies ( smaller separation ) is due to hydrodynamical effects , which are not taken into account in the pn approach .",
    "a turning point of @xmath21 along an irrotational evolutionary sequence indicates the orbital ( dynamical ) instability @xcite .",
    "this instability originates both from relativistic effects and hydrodynamical effects . in the case where no turning point of @xmath21 occurs along the sequence ,",
    "the mass - shedding limit ( roche lobe overflow ) marks the end of the inspiral phase of the binary system , since recent dynamical calculations for @xmath23 polytrope have shown that the time to coalescence was shorter than one orbital period for configurations at the mass - shedding limit ( i.e. see @xcite ) .",
    "thus the physical inspiral of binary compact stars terminates by either the orbital instability ( turning point of @xmath21 ) or the mass - shedding limit . in both cases",
    ", this defines the _ innermost stable circular orbit ( isco)_. the end of inspiral phase strongly depends on eos - for irrotational neutron star binaries a quasi - equilibrium sequence terminates by mass - shedding limit ( circles at the end of each line in fig 2 ) and for strange stars by orbital instability ( shown as diamonds in fig .",
    "the differences in the evolution of binary strange stars and neutron stars stem from the fact that strange stars are principally bound by additional force than gravitation : the strong interaction between quarks .",
    "they are self - bound objects having very high adiabatic index at the stellar surface ( see @xcite ) .",
    "although the crust of a @xmath24 neutron star contains only a few percent of the stellar mass , this region is easily deformed under the action of the tidal forces resulting from the gravitational field produced by the companion star .",
    "the end of inspiral phase of binary stars strongly depends on the stiffness of matter in this region .",
    "the frequency of gravitational waves at the isco is one of potentially observable parameters by the gravitational wave detectors .",
    "in addition so called `` break frequency '' , a characteristic frequency where the power emitted in gravitational waves decreases measurably @xcite , could be an observable quantity . _ the frequencies of gravitational waves at the depature point from the 3pn aproximation and at the isco strongly depend on the eos .",
    "_ for irrotational equal mass ( of 1.35 @xmath25 at infinite separation ) binaries the isco frequency is @xmath26 for strange stars described by the mit bag model and between @xmath27 and @xmath28 for neutron stars described by nuclear eos ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the 3rd pn approximations for point masses derived by different authors are giving isco at very high frequencies of gravitational waves @xmath29 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that the frequency at isco found in quasi - equilibrium approximation could differ from that obtained by the numerical integration of the full set of time dependent einstein equations .",
    "the only comparison ( according to the authors knowledge ) between these two approches for binary neutron stars can be found in marronetti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who showed that for a polytropic eos with @xmath30 and @xmath31 the frequency at the isco at quasi - equilibrium approximation is @xmath32 higher than the dynamical isco .",
    "thus full relativistic hydrodynamical calculations are required in order to obtain detailed predictions for particular forms of the nuclear matter equations of state .",
