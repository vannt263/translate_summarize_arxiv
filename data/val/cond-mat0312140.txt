    "co adsorption on metal surfaces has been studied extensively as a benchmark system for chemisorption . in particular ,",
    "great deal of information has been accumulated during the last thirty years about co adsorption on pd(100 ) surfaces using several different experimental techniques , and under a range of pressures and temperatures.@xcite there are also detailed theoretical studies of co adsorption on pd(100 ) using first - principles approaches.@xcite however , surprisingly , no extensive statistical mechanics studies have been performed to precisely determine adlayer ordering and phase transitions for this system .",
    "this is a significant omission since such analysis provides strong constraints on the type and magnitude of adspecies interactions .",
    "it also provides a reliable determination of thermodynamic quantities , which is not possible with simplified analyses .",
    "such information is invaluable in interpreting other experiments , e.g. , related to co adsorption energies .",
    "a long - standing motivation for such detailed studies of simple chemisorption systems is to provide insight into catalytic surface reactions .",
    "it is also well - recognized that ordering and islanding of reactants will limit the utility or validity of mean - field type rate equation treatments of the reaction kinetics.@xcite hence , accurate and robust atomistic modeling of adlayer structure for individual reactants is a crucial first step in building realistic atomistic model of related surface reactions , e.g. , for co oxidation on pd(100).@xcite    in this paper , we develop and analyze a lattice - gas ( lg ) model for co adlayers on pd(100 ) .",
    "our focus is on equilibrium aspects of this system , since molecularly adsorbed co can diffuse quite rapidly on this surface under normal situations facilitating adlayer equilibration .",
    "however , some nonequilibrium issues are also addressed .",
    "the main techniques used to analyze behavior of the lattice - gas model are the transfer matrix method and monte carlo simulation . we aim to reproduce as many experimental observations as possible using a relatively simple model .",
    "we present results regarding surface ordering below 0.5 monolayers ( ml ) in sec .",

    "[ sec : heat - adsorption ] , and the adsorption isobars in sec .",
    "[ sec : isobars ] .",
    "various experiments@xcite show that adsorbed co resides only at bridge sites on pd(100 ) .",
    "thus , our modeling of equilibrated adlayer configurations allows population of bridges sites only .",
    "we note , however , that it was suggested@xcite that during adsorption , co is first steered towards the less favorable top sites .",
    "thus , in more general modeling of nonequilibrium configurations under reaction conditions , it is appropriate to allow population of other sites.@xcite below , @xmath0 denotes the unit cell size of pd(100 ) surface .",
    "our lg modeling also assumes only pairwise - interactions between co adsorbates .",
    "figure  [ fig : schem_coint ] illustrates the specific interactions used : we incorporate nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interactions @xmath1 for co pairs separated by distance @xmath2 , second nn ( 2nn ) interactions @xmath3 for separation @xmath4 , third nn ( 3nn ) interactions @xmath5 for separation @xmath6 , and sometimes fourth nn ( 4nn ) interactions @xmath7 for separation @xmath8 .",
    "also illustrated in the figure is the experimentally observed @xmath9 ordered structure .",

    "the large open circles represent pd atoms and the small solid circle represents co molecules adsorbed on the bridge site of the pd(100 ) surface.,width=240 ]    in applying our model to analyze the heat of adsorption and the adsorption isobars for co / pd(100 ) , we need also information of the initial heat of adsorption at low coverage , which corresponds to the absorption energy of an isolated co molecule at a bridge site .",
    "this quantity was measured at 1.55 ev in an early experiment by tracy and palmberg,@xcite and at 1.67 ev in more recent experiments.@xcite using density functional theory ( dft ) incorporating the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) , eichler and hafner@xcite studied the potential energy surface for co adsorption on pd(100 ) .",
    "they reported the adsorption energy for co on a bridge site to 1.92 ev .",
    "this value is larger than the experimental estimate , but the trend that bridge sites are favored over top and hollow sites is consistent with experimental findings .    to analyze the above two - dimensional lg model , in this paper we use two standard yet powerful statistical mechanical techniques : the transfer matrix ( tm ) and the monte carlo ( mc ) methods .",
    "these two methods are often complementary . using tm",
    ", one can always obtain the equilibrium free energy and other thermodynamic properties of the system .",
    "however , it is difficult to include long - range interactions using tm .",
    "for example , performing analysis on a system or strip of size @xmath10 , in order to include 3nn interaction @xmath5 , it is necessary to consider all configurations of two columns spanning the strip .",
    "thus , one must consider a total of @xmath11 configurations , if one does not reduce this number by exclusion and symmetry properties .",
    "on the other hand , it is relatively straight - forward to include long - range interactions using the mc method .",
    "however , standard mc can become inefficient , especially when there are strong repulsive adspecies interactions , or for low temperatures .",
    "from the observation of @xmath12 ordered structure , it has been deduced that lateral interactions between co(ads ) consist of strong nn and 2nn repulsions , and a weak 3nn repulsion .",
    "it has also been pointed out by behm _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite that the 3nn repulsion @xmath5 should not be too strong , otherwise it would instead produce a @xmath13 structure , which is not observed experimentally .    in order to quantify the effect of the 3nn interaction on the ordering of co adsorbates , we conduct a study of the phase transitions of the lattice - gas model with very strong nn and 2nn repulsions ( i.e. , exclusion ) , and a finite 3nn repulsion ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "different aspects of this model has been studied previously , but the complete picture is not available .    in the case of no 3nn interactions ( @xmath15 ) , it was found that there exists a very `` weak '' transition from a disordered phase to a semi - ordered phase upon increasing the co coverage above about @xmath16.@xcite at the maximum @xmath17 , the semi - ordered phase consists of alternating half - filled diagonal rows of bridge sites which can slide with respect to each other without energy penalty . in the limit of very strong 3nn repulsion ( @xmath18 )",
    ", it was found@xcite that there is a first - order liquid - solid - like transition with increasing co coverage .",
    "the ordered phase has a @xmath19 structure .",
    "( traditionally , results of the above studies are described with respect to the square lattice of bridge sites .",
    "this lattice is rotated by 45@xmath20 from the square lattice of pd(100 ) substrate atoms , and has twice the number of sites as pd atoms .",
    "thus , the coverage on this lattice satisfies @xmath21 . for @xmath15 , the semi - ordered phase is commonly denoted as ( 2@xmath221 ) phase , although it has long - range order in one dimension only .",
    "it has a maximal coverage of @xmath23 . for @xmath18 ,",
    "the ordered phase is described as @xmath24 with respect to the square lattice of bridge sites . )",
    "our tm and mc study shows that as @xmath5 increases from zero , the `` weak '' transition to the semi - ordered phase becomes stronger , and for larger 3nn repulsion , the transition converts to a first - order transition to the @xmath12 ordered structure .",
    "this implies the existence of a tricritical point . from mc simulations",
    ", we estimate that this tricritical point is located at @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 denotes the chemical potential for the adsorbed co ( which is described in more detail in the following sections ) .",
    "the corresponding coverage is @xmath28 ( or @xmath29 ) .    as @xmath30 further increases above approximately 1.9",
    ", there is another first - order transition , but this time , the transition is from the disordered phase to a @xmath31 phase .",
    "figure  [ fig : tm2d_phase_xmu_e3 ] shows our preliminary results directed towards mapping out the @xmath27-@xmath32 phase diagram of the model with nn and 2nn exclusion , and 3nn repulsion .",
    "it shows two first - order liquid - solid - like transitions ( dashed lines ) from disordered phase to either a @xmath33 ordered phase , or a @xmath34 ordered phase . also there is a solid - solid - like transition from the @xmath31 phase to the @xmath12 phase .",
    "there is a tricritical point connecting the continuous and first - order transitions to the @xmath35 phase .",
    "however , how the termination of the @xmath36 transition line is not clearly determined from the existing analysis .",
    "it is likely that the transition line bends towards and merges with the @xmath33 transition line sharply at around @xmath37 .",
    "-@xmath38 phase diagram of the lattice - gas model with nn and 2nn exclusion and 3nn repulsion .",
    "the solid line denotes a continuous transition obtained from transfer matrix ( tm ) finite - size - scaling@xcite ( 10 - 12 scaling ) .",
    "also shown are two first - order transitions obtained from locating local maximum in @xmath39 using two methods : the dashed lines are from tm ( with strip of size 10 ) calculations , and the symbols are from monte carlo simulations with the histogram method.@xcite , width=326 ]    under the framework of the lattice gas model with only repulsive interactions between neighboring pairs up to 3nn , one can conclude that @xmath40 ev so that at room temperature , no @xmath36 phase shall be observed .",
    "a caveat is that introducing further neighboring interactions can change the phase diagram significantly and the above constraint on the magnitude of @xmath5 is no longer valid if longer - ranged interactions should be considered .",
    "based on the above analysis ( and also our investigations in subsequent sections ) , we assign a value of @xmath41 ev for the strength of the 3nn repulsive interactions . in the following analyses which include consideration of behavior for co coverage above 0.5 ml , it is necessary to relax the constraint of 2nn exclusions .",
    "the value of @xmath3 of around 0.17 ev is determined from our analysis of the heat of adsorption in sec .",
    "[ sec : heat - adsorption ] , and adsorption isobars in sec .",
    "[ sec : isobars ] .",
    "however , before presenting these analyses , in sec .",
    "[ sec : comm - incomm - trans ] , we provide a more complete picture of adlayer ordering by describing behavior at coverage above 0.5 ml ( using the parameter choice @xmath42 , @xmath43 ev , and @xmath41 ev . )",
    "because of the difficulties of experimental techniques ( e.g. , work function and infrared analysis ) in dealing with high co coverage ( @xmath44 ) , structures of dense co adlayers on pd(100 ) are a matter of some debate.@xcite as @xmath45 increases above 0.5 ml , it is concluded from diffraction studies that the adlayers structure undergoes a commensurate - incommensurate transition ( cit ) . the study by schuster _ _ et al.__@xcite suggests it is in the pokrovsky - talapov universality class , consistent with expectation from symmetry arguments .",
    "lattice - gas models are not ideal for study of cit s , since they put too many constraints on the structure of domain walls . nonetheless , we perform a monte carlo study to investigate co adlayer structure above 1/2 ml .",
    "we simulate the system at a fixed pressure while lowering the temperature .",
    "we use glauber dynamics ( corresponding to adsorption / desorption in the lg model ) with the metropolis algorithm .",
    "occasionally , we also mix in kawasaki dynamics ( corresponding to diffusion in the lg model ) with the glauber dynamics . here , our focus is in the equilibrium structure of co adlayer , thus we do not need to mimic the physical kinetics accurately .",
    "the primary challenge is that due to co adspecies repulsions , adlayers can become nearly `` frozen '' using normal dynamics at high co coverage and low substrate temperature .",
    "in fact , the lg model with nn and 2nn exclusion has been used to study the glass transition.@xcite    although our simulations are not faithful to the physical adlayer dynamics , they provide at least some qualitative insights into adlayer structure . for a fixed system size with periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "if we lower the temperature very slowly , eventually a single domain occupies the whole system . upon further lowering the temperature ,",
    "defects are formed .",
    "however , we are unable to observe any well - defined domain wall structure as suggested by berndt and bradshaw.@xcite on the other hand , if we lower the temperature more quickly , then different domains still occupy the system near the transition point .",
    "further decreasing the temperature is accompanied by the enlargement of those original domains , and emergence of defects inside different domains .",

    "presence of carbon is suggested@xcite as the reason for this discrepancy , a claim disputed by others.@xcite    the presence of lateral interactions between co adspecies is often invoked@xcite to explain the coverage dependence of @xmath55 . yet to our knowledge , no systematic study of the isosteric heat of adsorption in an interacting lattice - gas model for this system has been performed previously .",
    "there are some general studies of effects of lateral interactions on the heat of adsorption using mean - field approximations ( see , e.g. , ref .   and references therein ) which are not reliable for models with relatively short - range interactions .",
    "in lattice - gas modeling , it is appropriate to use the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "we assume simply that the gas phase pressure @xmath54 is related to the chemical potential through @xmath59 .",
    "more accurate forms of the relationship between the pressure and the chemical potential will introduce corrections to the heat of adsorption on the order of @xmath60 , which is negligible for present purposes . unlike the isobar experiments ( treated later in sec .",

    ", we examine the coverage dependence of @xmath55 for the lattice - gas model with various choices of interactions .",
    "any coverage dependence would reflect the influence of adspecies interactions which can cause @xmath55 to deviate from its limiting value of @xmath61 for low coverage .",

    "however , the coverage dependence is quite nonlinear .",
    "for example , with 3nn interactions only ( the dotted line ) , @xmath55 only decreases slightly for @xmath68 .",
    "this is again due to the fact that below this coverage , co(ads ) can easily arrange themselves in a way to avoid any 3nn pairs",
    ".    with the present set of parameters for lateral interactions , the lattice - gas model produces a coverage dependence of the heat of adsorption somewhat between the experimental results of behm _ et al . _ and other groups .",
    "most of the decrease in the heat of adsorption occurs when @xmath44 , while only a slight decrease occurs when @xmath58 .",
    "the near parabolic decrease in @xmath55 starting from @xmath69 , as well as the transient increase after the ordering transition , shown by fig .",
    "[ fig : tm2g8_isosteric ] are quite reminiscent to the experimental results of guo and yates@xcite for co adsorption on pd(111 ) .",
    "however , they reported a plateau at an ordering transition , while we see first a sharp drop and then a plateau at the ordering transition point .",
    "for a co adlayer in equilibrium with gas phase co , it is clear that as the surface temperature increases ( at fixed pressure ) , the co coverage will decrease . for higher ( fixed ) pressures ,",
    "this decrease will be delayed until a higher temperature range . to quantify this behavior using our lg model",
    ", one needs a more quantitative determination of the relationship between pressure and chemical potential than that presented in the previous section . to this end",
    "additional assumptions are needed .",
    "we assume that the impingement rate is given by @xmath70 and the attempt frequency for desorption is @xmath71 , then we assume that @xmath72 the initial sticking coefficient when @xmath69 is taken to be unity .",
    "thus by assuming equilibrium of co between gas phase and the chemisorption phase , one can calculate the adsorption isobar of the lattice gas model using either the transfer matrix or the monte carlo method .",
    "the results are shown in fig .  [",

    "experimentally , this corresponds to the adlayer moving into the regime of the commensurate - incommensurate transition discussed in sec .",

    "_ obtain a value on the order of @xmath79 from their adsorption isobars .",
    "consequently there is some discrepancy between the lattice - gas model prediction and experiments at low coverage . specifically for @xmath58 ml , significant",
    "desorption occurs at a higher temperature than experiments . adopting adsorption energy @xmath61 from dft calculations and assuming the same prefactor makes the discrepancy even larger .",
    "also the discrepancy will not likely be resolved by modification of interactions , since at low coverage lateral interactions are quite insignificant .",
    "we have performed a combined transfer matrix and monte carlo study of a lattice - gas model for co adlayers on pd(100 ) .",
