    "the linear transport regime is governed by a number of fundamental principles .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether these principles extend into the non - linear regime and if not what causes their breakdown .",
    "for instance , the onsager - casimir theory of irreversible processes @xcite applied to electrical conduction @xcite implies that the conductance of a two probe conductor is an even function of magnetic field @xmath2 .",
    "we might expect that this symmetry is valid even in the non - linear regime and that quite generally the current is an even function of magnetic field @xmath3 for any voltage @xmath1 applied to the conductor .",
    "however , a closer inspection shows that this is not true . in a recent work  @xcite ,",
    "we have shown that already the weakly nonlinear current response quadratic in voltage is in general not an even function of magnetic field .",
    "this implies that the onsager relations are _ strictly _ limited to the linear transport regime and that the @xmath0@xmath1 characteristics contains a term @xcite proportional to the magnetic field @xmath4 and the applied voltage squared , @xmath5 .",
    "interestingly , the effect depends on the fact that electrons are interacting particles . a theory based on free electrons gives an @xmath0@xmath1 characteristics which is even in magnetic field .",
    "consequently this discussion demonstrates that also the noninteracting picture of electrical transport is strictly limited to the linear transport regime .",
    "there has been a growing interest in the investigation of the nonlinear current through low - dimensional electronic structures in which electron transport is phase coherent . at the same time",
    ", high - field effects have found much interest in the rapidly developing field of molecular transport .",
    "we highlight the observation of _ rectification _ effects in solid - state mesoscopic junctions  @xcite and molecular structures  @xcite which , when the temperature is low enough , arise already at small bias voltages .",
    "our work@xcite has been focussed on the asymmetries shown in the rectification current of mesoscopic systems when a magnetic field is applied in addition to the external dc bias .",
    "we have first investigated a simple example of a resonant impurity in the quantum hall regime .  @xcite the hall potential is _ odd _ under magnetic field reversal .",
    "consequently , it is sufficient to demonstrate that nonlinear transport even in a two probe geometry is sensitive to the hall potential in order to generate an @xmath0@xmath1 characteristics that contains terms that are odd under magnetic field reversal .",
    "we have analyzed a model with a quasi - localized state coupled to chiral edge states  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath0@xmath1 curve exhibits a magnetic field asymmetry if either the charges on the edge states couple asymmetrically to the impurity state ( _ electrical asymmetry _ ) or if the impurity is coupled asymmetrically to the edge states simply due to asymmetric tunnel couplings ( _ scattering asymmetry _ ) .",
    "a second system that we have examined consists of a chaotic cavity coupled via quantum point contacts to metallic contacts ( see left inset of fig .",
    "[ dot ] ) .",
    "an ensemble of chaotic cavities , in which individual members differ only by small changes in shape , exhibits an ensemble averaged @xmath0@xmath1 characteristics which is linear in voltage .",
    "in contrast an individual cavity exhibits a nonlinear @xmath0@xmath1 characteristics due to quantum interference effects .",
    "an @xmath0@xmath1 characteristics which is odd under magnetic field is a consequence of the magnetic field asymmetry of the electrical potential landscape inside the cavity . for chaotic cavities ,",
    "this effect is the stronger the better the local potential neutralizes excess charge which might arise due to the applied voltage . in our work ,  @xcite the cavity is ballistic ( the only scattering arises due to the potential walls of the cavity and possibly due to diffraction of the carriers at the contacts to the cavity ) .",
    "alternatively , one can consider a small conductor which is metallic diffusive.@xcite even though a ballistic cavity and a small metallic diffusive sample are very different conductors , the theory gives qualitatively similar predictions .",
    "both for the ballistic cavity and the diffusive cavity the asymmetry becomes smaller very rapidly with increasing conductance .",
    "for the ballistic cavity we found detailed results in terms of the number of open channels of the quantum point contacts linking the sample to the metallic contacts .",
    "the effect we find is very small , at best of the order of the conductance quantum .",
    "possibly , this is connected to the fact that the ensemble averaged @xmath0@xmath1 characteristics of a chaotic cavity is linear .",
    "we can not exclude that there are special geometries that exhibit a magnetic field asymmetry which is much stronger than the effect reported here .",
    "below , we investigate the effect of inelastic scattering with the help of a voltage probe and demonstrate that for the chaotic cavities it reduces further the magnetic field asymmetry .",
    "the magnetic field symmetry of transport coefficients is an important probe of our understanding of transport phenomena .",
    "it is well known that the magnetic field symmetry of linear conductance played an important role in the development of a scattering theory that is applicable to a wide range of experimental configurations @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field symmetry of ac - transport conductances has similarly been discussed @xcite but only a few experimental works are available @xcite .",
    "the self - consistent , nonlinear scattering approach to dc - transport which we will use here has been developed in ref . and by christen and bttiker @xcite .",
    "for closely related discussions see refs . .",
    "in addition to linear and nonlinear dc - transport , and ac - conductances , the magnetic field symmetry is also of interest for the dc - currents generated through pumping .",
    "a dynamic modulation of the shape of the chaotic cavity has been experimentally shown to induce a dc current asymmetric@xcite in @xmath4 .",
    "the theory of magnetic field symmetry of pumped currents is the subject of refs .  .",
    "the magnetic field symmetry of an adiabatic two - parameter pump in the presence of a dc - voltage is discussed by moskalets and bttiker @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear conductance fluctuations asymmetric in @xmath4 have been measured in experiments in chaotic cavities  @xcite .",
    "the experiment finds fluctuations which are smaller than predicted by the theoretical model . since in a realistic situation dephasing time",
    "might be of the same order as the dwell time inside the cavity , we report below an investigation of the role of dephasing .",
    "we consider a generic mesoscopic conductor connected to @xmath6 reservoirs and gates .",
    "we model the transport with the scattering approach . in this picture , the probability amplitude for an electron to go from lead @xmath7 to lead @xmath8 is given by the quantum - mechanical scattering matrix @xmath9 , which is a function of the carrier s energy @xmath10 .",
    "it describes elastic scattering within the conductor , assuming that inelastic processes take place only in the reservoirs far away from the conductor .",
    "the reservoirs are maintained at thermal equilibrium with fermi distribution function @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the electrochemical potential .",
    "thus , due to microscopic reversibility the amplitude for an electron to be transmitted from lead @xmath7 to lead @xmath8 at a given @xmath4 equals the amplitude from lead @xmath8 to lead @xmath7 when the magnetic field is _ reversed _ , i.e. , @xmath13 .",
    "it follows that the two - probe linear conductance @xmath14 fulfills the onsager s",
    "symmetry @xmath15 .    for linear transport",
    "the scattering matrix is evaluated for electron motion in the equilibrium potential @xmath16 . for a nonequilibrium situation ,",
    "the scattering matrix is a function of the potential generated by the charges piled up in the mesoscopic conductor  @xcite .",
    "the potential @xmath17 now depends on the set of electric potential shifts @xmath18 applied to the external reservoirs and nearby gates .",
    "[ in what follows , we assume for simplicity that @xmath19 is uniform inside the sample .",
    "the full theory  @xcite takes into account spatial inhomogeneities @xmath20 .",
    "the electrostatic potential is essential to a charge - conserving transport theory since the resulting current  voltage characteristics must obey gauge invariance , i.e. , the current expressions must depend only on voltage differences  @xcite . therefore , the onsager s symmetries of the scattering matrix @xmath21 depend crucially on whether or not the screening potential is an even function of @xmath4 .",
    "in linear response , eq .",
    "( [ eq_linearg ] ) , @xmath22 is evaluated at the equilibrium potential @xmath23 , thereby the conductance is an even function of the magnetic field , as should be . in the multiterminal case , a generalized reciprocity theorem holds  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the nonlinear regime the potential is not an even function of magnetic field @xcite as we will now discuss .    to ensure charge conservation the potential @xmath19 of the conductor floats up and down in response to the density of carriers injected through the leads .",
    "in addition , interaction with nearby gates causes a response of @xmath19 . as a consequence ,",
    "the electron density in the sample feels a potential which depends on the shifts @xmath24 of both bias and gate voltages . to leading order in the voltage shifts",
    "we can write @xmath25 where the _ characteristic potentials _  @xcite @xmath26 relate the variation of the screening potential in the sample to a voltage shift in the contact @xmath27 .    to compute @xmath28",
    "we need the charge density in response to a variation of the voltage at the contact and need the charge response to a small variation of @xmath19 .",
    "these response functions can be obtained from the _ partial density of states _ ,",
    "@xmath29 which is the portion of the density of states ( dos ) associated with carriers that enter the conductor from contact @xmath7 and leave it through contact @xmath8 .",
    "( when the spatial dependence is needed , the partial derivative with respect to the potential @xmath19 should be replaced by a functional derivative ) .",
    "the _ injectivity _ of lead @xmath7 describes the dos of those carriers which are injected from lead @xmath8 regardless to which reservoir the carriers are finally scattered , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "the _ emissivity _ of lead @xmath8 , @xmath31 , contains information only about the carriers which are leaving the sample through contact @xmath8 irrespective of the injecting contact(s ) .",
    "knowledge of these quantities is essential to find the charges which pile up in the conductor in response to a voltage shift . since imposing charge conservation",
    "involves a balance for the internal potential and the scattering matrix depends itself on @xmath19 , this problem needs to be solved _ self - consistently_.",
    "we postpone the solution for the chaotic cavity to the next section .",
    "an expansion of the current through lead @xmath8 in powers of the applied voltages , @xmath32 contains a linear term given by the linear conductance conductance matrix @xmath33 , and a leading - order rectification term @xmath34 which reads , for spinless electrons ,  @xcite @xmath35\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 $ ] with @xmath37 the identity matrix . although eq .",
    "( [ gnonl ] ) gives only the initial departure from linear behavior , the expansion has the advantage that all quantities ( like the linear conductance ) are evaluated in the equilibrium state .",
    "therefore , from a statistical mechanical point of view , we are on safe grounds .",
    "we now specialize to the two - terminal case : @xmath38 .",
    "the conductance matrix is then given by @xmath39 with @xmath40 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq_linearg ] ) .",
    "the nonlinear @xmath0@xmath1 characteristics depends not only on the voltage shifts of the contacts which permit particle exchange but also on how we shift the voltage on the nearby gates . to be definite ,",
    "we assume here @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "then , to second - order in the bias voltage @xmath1 the _ differential _ conductance takes the following form : @xmath43 hence , the magneto - asymmetry of @xmath44 , defined as @xmath45\\,,\\ ] ] depends only on the asymmetry of the rectification coefficient @xmath46 .",
    "moreover , we define the magneto - asymmetry of the screening potential : @xmath47\\,.\\ ] ] in turn , @xmath48 depends on the symmetry properties of the characteristic potentials .",
    "it is important to stress that injectivity @xmath49 and the emissivity @xmath50 are evaluated in the equilibrium potential and therefore satisfy the reciprocity relation @xmath51 .",
    "the injectivities and the emissivities are in general not even functions , in contrast to the total density of states ( the sum of all injectivities or the sum of all emissivities ) . as a consequence , the characteristic potentials ( and thereby the potential landscape ) which",
    ", as we will show , depend in an essential way on the injectivity are in general not even functions .",
    "therefore , the transport potential is in general not an even function of magnetic field .",
    "below , we prove that for a generic conductor ( a chaotic cavity ) the fluctuations of the potential possess a magnetic - field asymmetry and that , as a result , the fluctuations of the nonlinear current  voltage characteristics are not an even function of @xmath4 .",
    "we consider a ballistic quantum dot in which in the classical limit the electron trajectories are chaotic ( see left inset of fig .  [ dot ] ) ) .",
    "this defines a chaotic cavity which we connect to external reservoirs via two quantum point contacts with adjustable number @xmath52 and @xmath53 of propagating modes .",
    "scattering in such open cavities is successfully described by random matrix theory  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the cavity is in a perpendicular magnetic field with a total magnetic flux through the cavity of the order of one flux quantum , @xmath54 .",
    "this is sufficient to break time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the probability distribution of the scattering matrix is uniform over the unitary group ( symmetry class @xmath55 ) . on the ensemble average ,",
    "the current is a linear function of the applied voltage @xmath1 .",
    "the average conductance is just the classical series resistance of the two quantum point contacts : @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "weak localization corrections vanish when @xmath55 . due to wave interference different members of the ensemble have a different _ linear _ conductance . for @xmath58",
    "the variance of the conductance fluctuations is @xmath59 similar to the fluctuations in the linear conductance an individual cavity exhibits a fluctuating nonlinear @xmath0@xmath1 characteristics . unlike the linear regime , which has been extensively studied  @xcite , the quantum fluctuations of the nonlinear conductance have found much less attention ( see , however , refs .  ) .",
    "the energy scale of quantum interference effects is determined by the energy @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the dwell time for noninteracting electrons and @xmath62 the mean level spacing in the cavity .",
    "this energy is also the relevant energy scale for the nonlinear effects considered here .",
    "we next discuss in detail how we determine the transport potential @xmath19 .",
    "a poisson equation needs to be solved to obtain the characteristic potentials . here , we assume for simplicity that the potential can be described with a single variable @xmath19 neglecting its spatial fluctuations within the cavity . in the magnetic field range considered here ,",
    "the cavity is effectively zero - dimensional due to its isotropic scattering properties .",
    "we treat interactions within a random phase approximation which determines the hartree potential with the help of a self - consistent effective interaction .",
    "@xcite for the open cavity with ideal multi - channel quantum point contacts such an approach can be justified rigorously .",
    "@xcite in response to a voltage shift @xmath63 in lead @xmath8 a bare charge @xmath64 is injected into the cavity .",
    "this excess charge generates a potential response which in turn leads to a screening charge of _ opposite _ sign : @xmath65 determined by the total density of states @xmath66 .",
    "in addition , the dot is coupled capacitively to a gate at voltage @xmath67 and geometric capacitance @xmath68 .",
    "the excess charge on the cavity can now be expressed in two ways : consideration of the total charge response gives @xmath69 and consideration of the poisson equation gives @xmath70 therefore , using these two expressions to eliminate the total charge , we find for the potential @xmath71 note that @xmath19 is the deviation from the equilibrium value @xmath72 .",
    "taking the derivatives of @xmath19 with respect to the voltage shifts @xmath73 gives the characteristic potentials @xmath74 .",

    "the characteristics differ just by a sample - to - sample fluctuation . without loss of generality",

    "<S> we demonstrate that the nonlinear @xmath0@xmath1 characteristics of a two probe conductor is not an even function of magnetic field . while the conductance of a two - probe conductor is even in magnetic field , we find that already the contributions to the current which are second order in voltage , are in general not even . </S>",
    "<S> this implies a departure from the onsager microreversibility principle already in the weakly nonlinear regime . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the effect that we find is due to the coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> a measurement of the magnetic field asymmetry can be used to determine the effective interaction strength . as a generic example </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss the @xmath0@xmath1 characteristics of a chaotic quantum dot . </S>",
    "<S> the ensemble averaged @xmath0@xmath1 of such a cavity is linear : nonlinearities are due to quantum interference . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , phase - breaking reduces the asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we support this statement with a calculation which treats inelastic scattering with the help of a voltage probe . </S>"
