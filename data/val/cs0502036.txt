    "longitudinal recording has been the standard method in magnetic recording for decades .",
    "recent research has shown that this method seems to reach its physical limits in the near future due to the superparamagnetic effects .",
    "on the other hand , the technique which has been known prior to the longitudinal recording ",
    "perpendicular recording , has recently been the centre of research attention .",
    "perpendicular magnetic recording offers promising increased in recording densities , up to 1 terabit per square inch seems feasible  @xcite .",
    "as the areal density is increased , however , the signal processing aspects of magnetic recording becomes more difficult .",
    "sources of distortion including media noise , electronics and head noise , jitter noise , inter - track interference , thermal asperity , partial erasure and dropouts become more apparent and unless appropriate mitigation techniques are present , signals can not be retrieved reliably from the recording media .    since the discovery of turbo codes",
    ", soft - decision iterative decoding has been shown to be able to provide significant coding gain over the conventional detection method on magnetic recording .",
    "the utilisation of iterative decoding on the concatenation of partial - response ( pr ) channel and powerful error - correcting codes such as low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) and turbo codes has been proposed in many literatures .",
    "iterative decoding is a reduced - complexity method to achieve the optimum solution  the maximum - likelihood solution and as such , iterative decoding is sub - optimal .    in this paper , we present a method to improve the sub - optimality of the iterative decoding and demonstrate its applications to perpendicular magnetic recording in the presence of media noise .",
    "the improved method , which is known as the received - vector - coordinate - modification ( rvcm ) algorithm , follows on the previous works of the authors  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this method is similar to the works of  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "this paper also investigates the use of signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) mismatch  @xcite to mitigate the effect of media noise .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : channel ] describes the perpendicular recording channel used .",
    "the description of the rvcm algorithm is outlined in section  [ sec : rvcm ] and the performance of this algorithm is demonstrated in section  [ sec : performance ] .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] concludes this paper .",
    "[ fig : block - diagram ] shows the block diagram of the perpendicular recording system model used in this paper .",
    "the user data , denoted as @xmath0 , is a sequence of of input symbols taking values of @xmath1 .",
    "some error - protection redundancy is added to the sequence @xmath0 by the error - correcting - codes ( ecc ) encoder forming codeword sequence @xmath2 . to simulate the write current ,",
    "the sequence @xmath2 is mapped to @xmath3 according to @xmath4 operation .",
    "the scaling factor of @xmath5 is to ensure the transition takes values of @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that the read head produces zero voltage in the region of magnetic transitions and some voltage in the region of constant magnetic polarity .",
    "we approximate the single - transition step response , denoted as @xmath7 , using the hyperbolic - tangent function  @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the saturation level or the amplitude from zero to peak ( normalised to unity ) and @xmath10 is the time taken for @xmath7 to go from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath13 and @xmath10 are normalised to the symbol period , @xmath14 . throughout the paper , it is assumed that @xmath15 .",
    "we define the response of two adjacent transitions ( dibit - response ) @xmath16 as : @xmath17 and the readback signal @xmath18 is simply the convolution of @xmath2 and @xmath16 plus some noise : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the overall noise in the recording system which consists of media , jitter and electronic noise , i.e. @xmath21 .    the media noise , @xmath22 originates from the imperfections of the media and its effect is significant in the magnetic transition regions .",
    "typically , media noise is approximately four times the electronic noise at transition regions . in our system model",
    ", we consider the media noise as additive - white - gaussian - noise ( awgn ) with mean of @xmath23 and variance of @xmath24 , which exists in the transition region only . as",
    "shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : block - diagram ] , the media saturation noise depends on the saturation level and it is evaluated as @xmath25 . unlike media noise which is media dependent , the jitter noise @xmath26 is due to timing imperfection only . to model the sampling jitter noise , @xmath26 , the @xmath27th order taylor approximation is used . the jitter estimation block shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : block - diagram ] is done with @xmath28th order taylor series expansion of @xmath7 .",
    "the jitter probability density function is assumed to be uniform , limited by a maximum value .",
    "the electronic noise , @xmath29 is awgn with mean of @xmath23 and variance of @xmath30 .",
    "the recording system in fig .",
    "[ fig : block - diagram ] caters for many different simulation cases with varying degree of electronics , media and sampling jitter noise .",
    "we define the channel snr as : @xmath31    the noisy readback signal is equalised to @xmath32 pr target which is only optimal for electronic noise at the considered @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "it serves for comparison purposes only .",
    "the maximum - a - posteriori ( map ) decoder of the pr channel exchanges extrinsic with the ecc decoder to deliver solution which is used for performance evaluation .",
    "it has been shown that the rvcm algorithm provides considerable coding gain for parallel and serial concatenated turbo codes  @xcite,@xcite and ldpc codes  @xcite .",
    "the algorithm can be applied directly to perpendicular recording and is described briefly below .",
    "let @xmath33 denote an @xmath34tuple vector at the output of the map decoder , that is the a - posteriori probability ( app ) of the map decoder .",
    "let @xmath35 denote the reliability sequence of @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",
    "assume that @xmath38 is an integer where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is a vector of length @xmath38 .",
    "* step 1 . * : :    store the vector @xmath41 , let the integer    @xmath42 be initialised to @xmath23 .",
    "* step 2a . * : :    set @xmath43 and    @xmath44 .",
    "restart the iterative    decoder , store the decoded vector    ( @xmath45 ) . *",
    "* : :    set @xmath46 .",
    "restart the iterative    decoder , store the decoded vector    ( @xmath47 ) and restore    @xmath48 , i.e.    @xmath49",
    ". * step 3 . * : :    if @xmath50 then set @xmath51 and    continue to * step 2*. otherwise , stop the algorithm and from the list    of all decoded vectors    @xmath52 ,    @xmath53 , choose a    decoded vector that has the minimum euclidean distance .",
    "it is assumed    that the iterative decoder always outputs a codeword .    from the steps above ,",
    "it is clear that the complexity of the algorithm depends on @xmath38 .",
    "one of the major obstacles concerning the rvcm algorithm is the difficulty in finding the symbol(s ) that , if modified , can converge the iterative decoder to the maximum - likelihood solution  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "these symbols are referred as the critical symbols and their distribution is uniform with no sign of vulnerable or favourite symbol positions .",
    "on the other hand , due to their uniform distribution , it is likely that we can find one of the critical symbols if we confine our search to a small group , i.e. keeping the value of @xmath38 low . in this way",
    ", we can reduce the computational complexity for the price of sub - optimum performance . as we will show later that",
    ", the gain obtained by confining @xmath38 to a small value is still significant compared to the performance of the standard iterative decoder .",
    "there are various methods for selecting the critical symbols , see  @xcite for details . in this paper",
    ", we restrict the selection to one method only , that is the reliability of the app at the output of the map decoder .",
    "we evaluate the performance of the rvcm algorithm on some short - block length turbo and ldpc codes . fig .",
    "[ fig : turbo - sm0 ] and  [ fig : turbo - sm4 ] show the error rate performance of the turbo code under the standard iterative and rvcm decoders .",
    "the turbo code considered is the @xmath54 tail - biting turbo code , where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 with @xmath58interleaver .",
    "significant improvement is noticed and the increase in performance gets better as snr increases .",
    "it is worth noting that the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : turbo - sm4 ] were obtained using snr mismatch technique . with this technique ,",
    "the improvement in performance over standard iterative decoder is even greater as snr increases . in the presence of media noise ,",
    "snr mismatch methods do not provide the same performance as observed with electronics noise only  @xcite , however better targets for media noise are being investigated by the authors .",

    "[ fig : gf2 - 127 - 84 ] .",
    "the @xmath59 cyclic ldpc code , which has minimum - distance of @xmath62 , was constructed using a method described in  @xcite . as mentioned earlier , the rvcm algorithm allows one to trade off the performance against the computational complexity . from fig .",
    "[ fig : gf2 - 127 - 84 ] , despite the performance obtained by setting @xmath63 is approximately @xmath64db inferior to that by setting @xmath65 , the coding gain from the standard iterative decoding is significant . for the case of @xmath63 , we select the critical symbols based on the reliability measure at the output of the map decoder . from the vector @xmath41 , we construct a vector @xmath66 of length @xmath38 such that @xmath67 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gf2 - 255 - 175 ] , we compare the performance of the @xmath60 cyclic code and that of the @xmath68 quasi - cyclic code .",
    "we can see that the rvcm algorithm provides significant gain , within one order of magnitude improvement , over the bp algorithm . at approximately @xmath69 ber ,",
    "the performance of the cyclic code with rvcm is within @xmath70db away from the longer code under bp decoding .",
    "we have shown that the application of the rvcm algorithm to perpendicular magnetic recording shows promising results .",
    "simulation results show that improvement of within one order of magnitude is possible .",
    "short block length offers an attractive error - correction scheme in which rvcm algorithm can be fully exploited by setting @xmath65 .",
    "a bank consisting of @xmath71 parallel rvcm decoders can be built on chips and the decoding of short - block length data has low latency .",
    "the performance of longer block - length codes , up to a certain error - rate , can be outperformed by the application of rvcm algorithm to shorter codes .",
    "the exact point , at which the longer codes start to perform better , depends on the code structure .",
    "we also extended our investigations on using some non binary cyclic ldpc codes  @xcite and we observe similar improvement as in the binary cases .",
