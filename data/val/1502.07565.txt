    "security of wireless communications has becoming increasingly important .",
    "openness of wireless networks makes them vulnerable to spoofing attacks where an unauthorized user masquerades as another legitimate user . in the past",
    ", conventional cryptographic security mechanisms were used to foil such attacks@xcite , in which the identity of a user should be authenticated through a challenge - response process , namely , authentication and key agreement ( aka ) protocol . the aka protocol",
    "was revised @xcite for stronger security from second - generation ( 2 g ) to fourth - generation ( 4 g ) systems .",
    "a recent aka protocol , known as evolved packet system aka ( eps - aka ) @xcite , has been proposed for the long term evolution ( lte ) system .",
    "the security of state - of - the - art eps - aka protocol comes from computational complexity , namely , the adversary has limited computational power .",
    "it is believed that more efforts should be done to prevent potential innovative attacks since the wireless medium offers novel avenues for intrusion .    in recent years , various efforts",
    "@xcite have been made in authenticating the transmitter and receiver at the physical layer . in general",
    ", these physical layer authentication schemes can be classified as key based or keyless , according to whether a secret key shared between the transmitter and receiver is exploited to authenticate each other or not . in the keyless authentication schemes",
    "@xcite , some specific features of either the transmitting device or the specific channel between the legitimate users were exploited in order to authenticate the transmission . as an initial trusted transmission",
    "is often required for identifying the features , they might be difficult to implement in some practical scenarios . instead , various key based authentication schemes @xcite are closer to the traditional challenge - response mechanism , but less prone to attacks due to the protection from the unique randomness of physical characteristics .    for key based challenge - response authentication schemes , two legitimate users , alice and bob , shared a secret key .",
    "whenever alice transmits a random number as the challenge , bob sends back a response ( often called a tag ) , which is the output of a cryptographic hash function with both the challenge and key as its inputs . by verifying the response with a locally generated tag ,",
    "bob s identity can be confirmed .",
    "indeed , both schemes in @xcite follow this authentication mechanism , which are implemented at the physical layer . in @xcite ,",
    "both alice and bob presume public challenges , which are used to generate tags with the shared key , and the tag is physically encapsulated as an embedded fingerprint , which is conveyed with the primary transmission by superposition .",
    "the embedded fingerprint is often allocated with low power , which is further corrupted by the channel noise .",
    "hence , its recovery is in general difficult for the adversary , as she / he faces a fundamental information - theoretic challenge , not purely a computational one .",
    "the physical layer challenge - response authentication mechanism ( phy - cram ) proposed in @xcite implements the conventional challenge - response process at the physical layer , where the randomness of fading channel s amplitude is used to protect both challenge and response ( tag ) .",
    "recently , we proposed a physical layer phase challenge - response authentication scheme ( phy - pcras ) for multicarrier transmission in @xcite .",
    "it requires the channel reciprocity and the randomness of channel - phase response @xcite for the protection of the shared key from possible eavesdropping .    by exploiting the randomness of physical channels",
    ", various physical layer authentication schemes may ensure unconditional security at least for some bits of the shared key ( which can not be broken even if the adversary has unlimited computational power ) .",
    "however , this enhanced security depends heavily on the underlying physical channel , which is often out of our control . in the worst case of static channels ( for example , line - of - sight communications )",
    ", this kind of unconditional security may not be guaranteed .",
    "in this paper , we consider to develop an improved version of phy - pcras for practical ofdm transmission , which can guarantee enhanced security even in the worst case of static channels .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we propose a novel artificial - noise - aided phy - pcras ( ana - phy - pcras ) for practical ofdm transmission , where the tikhonov - distributed artificial noise is introduced to interfere with the phase - modulated key for resisting possible attacks .",
    "a strictly - positive key equivocation can be ensured even for the worst case scenario .",
    "we make a fine improvement on phy - pcras @xcite , where the estimate of phase differences between subcarriers is simply replaced by the direct estimate of subcarrier phases .",
    "this makes the implementation of phy - pcras simpler .",
    "a time - separated subchannel allocation scheme is provided to obtain a sufficient number of uncorrelated subchannels .",
    "then , a modified ana - phy - pcras is proposed for use of time - separated subchannels , which shows its robustness in verification for alleviating the discontinuity of channel phase at far - separated time slots .",
    "various practical issues are discussed with non - ideal ofdm transmission , including imperfect carrier and timing recoveries . in particular , we show that small sampling offsets often result in significant frequency offsets along the allocated subcarriers , which should be compensated for proper verification . 5 .",
    "we also provide an application model for generating the shared keys between two legitimate nodes in 4 g mobile networks .",
    "hence , the conventional challenge - response authentication scheme employed in 4 g networks might be replaced by ana - phy - pcras with enhanced security .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we propose an ana - phy - pcras for perfect ofdm transmission , and a time - separated subchannel allocation scheme is presented , along with a modified ana - phy - pcras .",
    "section - iii is devoted to practical issues with non - ideal ofdm transmission .",
    "the security analysis of ana - phy - pcras is given in sectiion - iv .",
    "simulation results are presented in section - v , and the conclusion is made in section - vi .",
    "in this paper , we employ a common alice - bob - eve model , where two trusting parties , alice and bob , share some common secrets and they want to authenticate each other , while eve , as an opponent , has no any knowledge about the shared secrets and wants to impersonate alice or bob .    from the viewpoint of modern cryptography ,",
    "the development of cryptographic primitives should consider the worst case scenario . in the past ,",
    "various physical layer authentication schemes were proposed and claimed enhanced security of information - theoretic nature , which , however , depends heavily on the randomness of the underlying physical channel . whenever the physical channel happens to be static ,",
    "there is simply no guarantee of enhanced security .",
    "therefore , it is essential to consider the worst case of static channels between alice and bob for developing physical layer authentication schemes .",
    "we propose a novel ana - phy - pcras for ofdm transmission , which makes two nontrivial improvements on phy - pcras@xcite .",
    "firstly , channel uncertainty has been proved to be essential for ensuring enhanced security in various physical layer cryptographic approaches . for ana - phy - pcras , we introduce the tikhonov - distributed artificial noise to interfere with the phase - modulated key , which could be used to create artificial channel uncertainty . therefore , the minimum amount of enhanced security of information - theoretic nature can be guaranteed even in the worst case scenario .",
    "this contrasts sharply to various reported physical layer authentication schemes , which rely solely on the randomness of the physical channel .",
    "whenever the channel randomness appears , ana - phy - pcras can be protected by the uncertainty from both the physical channel and artificial noise .",
    "secondly , we make a fine improvement on phy - pcras , where the estimate of phase differences between subcarriers is simply replaced by the direct estimate of subcarrier phase .",
    "it does work as we use a noncoherent metric for verification , which remains unchanged for any random but constant phase increment over all subcarriers .",
    "in this paper , we assume a multipath fading channel between alice and bob .",
    "it is often associate with a channel coherence time @xmath0 , below which the channel is considered as temporally correlated .",
    "assuming an ofdm system with @xmath1 subcarriers , a bandwidth of @xmath2 hz and symbol length of @xmath3 seconds , of which , @xmath4 seconds are due to the length of cyclic prefix ( cp ) , and @xmath5 . in the following , we use @xmath6 to denote the sampling period .",

    "with bpsk modulation , the size of shared key is equal to the number of independent subchannels .",
