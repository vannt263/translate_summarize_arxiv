    "the discovery of nonzero neutrino masses is one of the most impressive developments in particle physics recently made .",
    "in addition to cosmological observations , the flux measurements of solar and atmospheric neutrinos indicate that neutrino masses are tiny compared to the other fermion masses  @xcite . the smallness of neutrino masses may be regarded as an indication of higher energy scale than the electroweak one , possibly connected with deeper concepts such as grand unification and other anticipated scenarios beyond the standard model ( sm ) .    as a feasible paradigm to address problems in the sm ,",
    "theories with extra spatial dimensions have been widely studied over the past decade .",
    "for example , the gauge hierarchy problem is solved by large volume of the extra space which makes the planck scale suppressed down to tev  @xcite .",
    "the localized gravity with the warped metric  @xcite also provides a possible interpretation of the gauge hierarchy by small overlap between matter and gravitational fields .",
    "interestingly , these mechanisms for the hierarchy problem also control the neutrino mass . as in the same way that the gravitational flux is diluted ,",
    "the neutrino mass is suppressed if gauge - singlet neutrinos propagate in the bulk  @xcite .",
    "for the warped extra dimension , the localization of bulk neutrinos produces tiny dirac neutrino masses  @xcite .",
    "thus the connection between neutrino physics and extra dimensions has been a subject of great interests to particle physics  @xcite .",
    "motivated by this phenomenological connection , we discuss the seesaw mechanism in higher - dimensional theory where right - handed majorana neutrinos spread over the extra space .",
    "our main emphasis in this paper is on the propagator for bulk majorana fermion which serves as an useful tool to calculate the low - energy neutrino mass induced by the seesaw operation . in section 2",

    "section 4 is devoted to summarizing the results .",
    "appendices  [ lg ] and [ pvbc ] show our convention for lorentz spinors and the derivation of propagators in various situations .",
    "in this section , we introduce the framework of higher - dimensional seesaw mechanism and illustrate the kaluza - klein ( kk ) expansion and the propagator method to obtain low - energy neutrino masses .      the fifth dimension @xmath2 is compactified on the @xmath3 orbifold such that there are two fixed points at @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",

    "this is because , in the large - size limit of extra dimension , the difference of boundary conditions at @xmath44 is irrelevant to the physics at @xmath45 where the sm fields reside .",
    "the former case @xmath112 shows up an interesting feature of the twisted boundary condition ; the seesaw - induced mass is proportional to the majorana mass parameter of bulk heavy neutrinos .    in terms of the kk expansion ,",
    "such unusual seesaw behavior is understood as the inverse seesaw suppression , which is similar to the previous standard case ( [ en1 ] ) . in the present case ,",
    "the inverse seesaw is achieved by the twisted boundary condition which forbids no - winding wavefunctions .",
    "that is , the zero mode is absent in the effective theory .",
    "( in the standard case , the zero - mode effect is suppressed by its localized wavefunction . ) with the twisted boundary condition @xmath113 and @xmath114 , the kk wavefunctions and masses are given by @xmath115 for @xmath116 .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix is then given by the same form as ( [ inversess ] ) and the inverse seesaw takes place if @xmath112 .",
    "table 1 shows the seesaw - induced neutrino mass @xmath53 for various limits and boundary conditions .",
    "the columns represent two patterns of boundary conditions @xmath117 and the rows possible hierarchies among the mass parameters @xmath28 , @xmath93 , and @xmath25 .",
    "the other two conditions @xmath118 and @xmath119 correspond to the exchanges of right- and left - handed components of bulk fermions .",
    "if @xmath93 is the largest , it turns out that the neutrino mass does not depend on the ordering of @xmath28 and @xmath25 .",
    "further , if @xmath93 is not the largest , only the hierarchy between @xmath28 and @xmath25 affects the results .",
    "therefore three ordering patterns ( labeled by type  a ,  b ,  c in table  [ pattern ] ) are practically relevant .",

    "<S> a five - dimensional seesaw framework is analyzed with the lepton - number - violating propagator of bulk right - handed neutrinos . that can bypass summing up the effects of heavy majorana particles whose masses and wavefunctions are not exactly known . </S>",
    "<S> the propagator method makes it easier to evaluate the seesaw - induced neutrino mass for various boundary conditions of bulk neutrinos and in a general background geometry , including the warped extra dimension . </S>",
    "<S> it is also found that the higher - dimensional seesaw gives a natural framework for the inverse seesaw suppression of low - energy neutrino masses .    </S>",
