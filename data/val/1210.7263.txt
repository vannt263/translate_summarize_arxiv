    "strong correlations between the masses of central supermassive black holes and properties of host galaxies , coupled with the seeming ubiquity of such black holes , suggest an evolutionary link between black holes and their host galaxies .",

    "a common scenario involves processes in which feedback from an active black hole couples with star - forming gas in the host galaxy ( silk & rees 1998 ; fabian 1999 ; king 2003 ; di matteo et al . 2005 ; murray et al .",

    "2007 ) cautioned that comparing agn samples with the local sample of quiescent galaxies could produce a false signal of evolution because of the differing selection criteria used .",
    "comparing one agn sample with another agn sample can also be problematic unless the selection criteria for both are the same .",
    "one way to mitigate this problem is to compare lower-@xmath43 and higher-@xmath43 samples that were selected using the same criteria , which we have done to some extent , with the added feature of the mass bins .",
    "as seen in figure [ f : dmbhbins ] , the magnitude and sign of the offset from the local relationship is a function of the black hole mass .",
    "this may provide some insight into the problem of the seemingly disparate results in studies of black hole - galaxy evolution .",
    "many of the agn studies of evolution focus on black hole ",
    "galaxy relationships not only for relatively small redshift ranges , but for a relatively narrow range of black hole masses .",
    "it is possible that some of these studies are simply observing the offset of samples from the local relationship that arises from inherent scatter , as opposed to actual evolution .",
    "we have investigated the  relationship for sdss dr7 quasars in the redshift range @xmath0 to assess whether any evolution has taken place .",
    "we used the `` photoionization method '' with the widths of the broad  or  emission lines and the quasar continuum luminosity to calculate black hole masses , and the widths of the narrow  or  lines as surrogates for the stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "we divided our lower - redshift ho3 sample into black hole mass bins incremented by 0.5 dex to assess the change in the  relationship as a function of redshift for different black hole masses .",
    "all but one of the mass bins are offset from the local relationship , with the magnitude and direction of the offset determined by the black hole mass and the degree of scatter in the relationship .",
    "the offsets for the lowest - mass and highest - mass black holes appear to evolve with redshift ; however , various observational biases can account for most or all of the apparent evolution .",
    "the offsets for the middle three mass bins remain approximately constant with redshift and suggest a limit of @xmath40.2 dex on any evolution in the  relationship up to @xmath50 .",
    "finally , it may be possible to reconcile some of the seemingly disparate results from various studies of evolution in the black hole - galaxy relationships by accounting for offsets in the relationship for different masses due to scatter .",
