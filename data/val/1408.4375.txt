    "donor spins in silicon represent one of the most promising and well studied candidates for quantum computing architectures  @xcite .",
    "very long coherence times have been measured in both nuclear @xcite and electron spin donor qubits @xcite , and individual spins can be manipulated and measured  @xcite . in any large scale information processing architecture ,",
    "the application of an electric field is likely to be a vital enabling tool for addressing individual qubits  @xcite .",
    "whatever the specific setting used , manipulation of quantum information in these systems requires a thorough understanding of how the energy levels of the spin qubits are modified by external magnetic or electric fields .",
    "these could either be deliberately applied to execute a particular gate operation , or exist anyway in an inhomogeneous electrostatic environment .",
    "electric fields in particular can strongly affect two main properties of the donor via the stark effect : the hyperfine coupling between the nuclear and the electron spin , proportional to the electronic density at the nuclear site , and the electron @xmath3-factor , i.e. the splitting induced by a magnetic field between the spin up and the spin down electronic levels .",
    "knowledge of such effects is ever more critical when an electric field is used to directly engineer the electronic wave function for storage or manipulation of quantum states  @xcite .",
    "the first and most famous proposal of this kind was provided by kane @xcite , where a single qubit state , encoded in the impurity nuclear spin , is manipulated by using a stark shift to bring it into resonance with an oscillating magnetic field .",
    "more recently , scalable architectures have been proposed to extend single qubit control techniques to larger structures @xcite .    for these reasons ,",
    "the stark effect in doped silicon has been broadly studied in literature , either theoretically @xcite or experimentally @xcite .",
    "more generally , the ability to theoretically describe the donor electron wave function accurately in a wide range of electrostatic environments is beneficial for determining the values of control parameters which provide best performance , and in the best case for estimating _ a priori _ the feasibility of quantum algorithms and error correction codes @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the physical mechanisms underlying stark effect of donors in silicon are not yet fully understood .",
    "the best attempt so far within effective mass theory ( emt ) was proposed by friesen @xcite : for si : p he correctly predicted a quadratic hyperfine shift , but one which is one order of magnitude larger than the value expected from the two measurements performed so far ( si : sb @xcite and si : as @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , other theories such as tight binding ( tb ) and band minima basis ( bmb ) @xcite have been applied to the same si : p problem , leading to closer agreement with experiment .",
    "tb and bmb , though , are computationally demanding numerical approaches , which eclipse full physical understanding .",
    "current theoretical predictions of hyperfine shifts , then , are limited to si : p alone , but other v group donors such as bi are now established as promising alternative donor qubits and are being widely researched  @xcite .",
    "we are thus motivated to present a multi - valley emt that provides a unifying framework for p , as , sb and bi donors .",
    "theoretical predictions are supported by complete and precise experimental work .",
    "finally , we will consider the effects of the electric field on the donor ground binding energy .",
    "this has raised opposing opinions @xcite as which of two competing effects play a dominant role in determining its magnitude : the lowering of single - valley energies due to admixing higher orbital states in the ground level , _ vs _ the narrowing of the valley - orbit @xmath0 spectrum , which is a consequence of the reduced effect of the short - range impurity potential on the energy levels when the electron moves away from the nucleus .",
    "we clarify how the interplay of both results in an overall energy decrease of the ground donor state under the external field , confirming earlier _ ab initio _ calculations @xcite .",
    "the highly successful match between our theory and experimental measurements motivates the determination of expected field ionization thresholds for each implanted donor species , setting @xmath4 upper limits to the achievable speeds for single - qubit operations relying on resonant excitation of selected donor electron spin transitions ( like the kane architecture @xcite ) ; and @xmath5 gate voltages which should be applied to read - out the state of bulk qubits @xcite , possibly following transfer of quantum information to the electron spin from other degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of a donor electron weakly bound to an impurity nucleus implanted in a silicon lattice is : @xmath6\\psi(\\textbf{r})= \\epsilon \\psi(\\textbf{r}),\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the wave function of the donor electron , @xmath8 is its rest mass , @xmath9 is the periodic potential of the undoped silicon crystal , @xmath10 accounts for the interaction with the impurity ion , @xmath11 is a uniform external electric field , and @xmath12 stands for the resulting energy eigenvalues .",
    "the bottom conduction band in silicon has six equivalent minima ( valleys ) @xmath13 , one along each of the crystallographic @xmath14 directions in @xmath15 space and located @xmath16 of the way to the edge of the brillouin zone ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the donor ground state can be expanded to a good approximation in terms of packets of bloch functions whose @xmath18-vectors concentrate around each minimum .",
    "this is the cornerstone of emt @xcite , which is improved further by accounting for the inter - valley coupling induced by the impurity potential .",
    "such coupling is strongest in the lattice cell containing the donor nucleus  this is the so - called central cell correction @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will use a multi - valley emt which accounts for the anisotropy of the silicon conduction band and includes a suitable donor - dependent pseudopotential that mimics the impact of a dopant nucleus on the periodic environment of the undoped silicon lattice hosting the electron @xcite . within the central cell ,",
    "the impurity potential differs significantly from the screened coulomb attraction usually considered in single valley - treatments @xcite , and is responsible for the lifting of the valley degeneracy inherent to undoped silicon .",
    "we take : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the static dielectric constant for silicon , @xmath21 is the elementary charge , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are parameters setting the two inverse lengthscales specific to the central cell corrections @xmath24 of each impurity potential .",

    ", emt requires the umklapp @xmath39 contributions to this product to be neglected .      with the external electric field turned off",
    ", we arbitrarily fix the two donor - dependent parameters of the pseudopotential ( [ ning ] ) , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , then variationally minimize the @xmath0-manifold energies @xmath40 thus setting the corresponding optimal wave functions @xmath41 .",
    "the procedure is repeated with different values for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , until the experimental ionization energies of the singlet @xmath42 ( the ground state ) , the triplet @xmath43 and the doublet @xmath44 eigenstates are reproduced .",
    "those states are the result of the lifting of the six - fold aforementioned valley degeneracy , and their coefficients @xmath45 ( see eq .",
    "[ waveexpansion ] ) are fixed by tetrahedral symmetry @xcite , consistent with the pseudopotential employed here .",
    "previous multi - valley emt studies @xcite have also employed a variational approach , but with hydrogenic bohr functions as trial effective mass envelopes @xmath46 , to compute the same energy levels .",
    "while the variational method is expected to give reliable guesses at the binding energies , no rigorous inferences can be drawn about the exact nature of the wave function : this is the reason why many different pseudopotentials and emt approximations used in the past led to satisfactory agreement with the former , but poor descriptions of the latter . as a first improvement , in a previous paper @xcite we highlighted the importance of using anisotropic envelopes and imposing further constraints on the shape of the wave function , as indicated by experimental measurements .",
    "more precisely , we set the trial ground state function of a si : p electron to match the experimental contact hyperfine coupling , which is proportional to the value of the electron density at the impurity site .",

    "nonetheless , the single - valley limit is a trustworthy solution far enough from the nucleus @xcite , where the screened coulomb interaction represents a good approximation to the potential felt by the effective mass electron . for those donors , anisotropic bohr envelopes are too simple to mediate between those contrasting features .",

    "the impact on the shape of the wave function in the central - cell region modifies @xmath107 negligibly , hence the inter - valley interactions are not affected significantly , and the spectral narrowing of the @xmath0 manifold is not strong enough to produce an overall energy increase of the ground state .",
    "our conclusion contrasts with ref . , where the electron was predicted to be less bound in increasing field , but it confirms the conclusions in the _ ab initio _ treatments presented in refs .  .",

    "[ ionizations ] : this is compatible with studies performed within different approaches @xcite , and confirms that bulk donor electrons ` instantaneously ' tunnel off an impurity nucleus , in contrast to adiabatic tuning available to electrons closer to an interface @xcite .",
    "so far we have dealt with electric fields of magnitudes that would be required for the execution of quantum gate operations .",
    "as @xmath44 increases by one order of magnitude above those considered so far , qualitatively new dynamics takes place @xcite : the @xmath208-like orbital levels of the donor electron ( with the singlet @xmath42 valley structure ) anti - cross with the slowly changing ground @xmath0-like state , so that the electron can effectively tunnel off the bulk of the silicon layer . using our model we can predict the ionization field for each of the donor chemical species .",
    "the size of this field is important , since spin dependent tunnelling is a leading proposed read - out technique for solid state spins @xcite .",
    "such read - out often occurs at the interface with an oxide layer , or close to an set device @xcite , which is rather far from the dopant nucleus and thus requires ionization of the donor electron .",
    "we compute the stark shifted binding energy of the bulk @xmath42 ` @xmath209 ' state as a function of the field ( see fig .

    "let us remark that valley - orbit effects play practically no role in determining the energy and the wave function of this state ( and more generally , of all non-@xmath59 states ) , since the corresponding orbital is concentrated far from the impurity nucleus and is thus not sensitive to the non - coulombic potential @xmath24 .",
    "for the same reason , its features do not depend on the specific chemical donor species .     where they become degenerate with the `",

    "the dependence of the @xmath42 @xmath211 binding energy on field qualitatively confirms the behavior calculated in refs .   and for a donor electron state closer than 25  nm to the interface with a dioxide .",
    "our results are specific to impurities implanted deep in the bulk of a si layer , though , and hence there are quantitative differences of a few tenths of v/@xmath148 m between our results and the threshold for si : p and si : as predicted in those references .",
    "we report in table [ tab : ionization ] , for the first time , the expected ionization fields for all bulk donors .    .predictions of the size of the electric field required to ionize each donor species , and the corresponding maximum absolute hyperfine shift @xmath218 that can be achieved before the electron tunnels away from the nucleus .",

    "single qubit operations in this system are performed via selective microwave ( esr ) magnetic pulses addressing the hyperfine- and zeeman - split transitions of the donor electron spin levels ( in the high magnetic field limit , electron - spin levels are only weakly hyperfine - mixed with the nuclear spin ones , i.e. the electron spin projection @xmath224 is a good quantum number ) . in order to manipulate individual spins within a large ensemble of implanted donors it is easiest@xcite to apply a global alternating magnetic field @xmath225 , bringing only selected qubits in resonance with it , by locally stark - shifting their spin - resonance frequency @xcite .",
    "the selected esr transitions can be shifted by at most @xmath226 with @xmath221 , the nuclear spin projection , equal to the nuclear spin quantum number @xmath227 @xcite .",
    "this maximum shift sets the limit on how quickly spins can be manipulated : if the timescale @xmath228 of @xmath225 pulses is shorter than @xmath229 , then the resonance frequencies of the non - selected qubits will lie within the pulse bandwidth .",
    "it follows that faster gates can be performed with larger @xmath230 , and this is in turn limited by the ionization threshold presented here .",
    "we estimate the maximum hyperfine frequency shifts that donor esr transitions can undergo in silicon while still being safe from ionization : results are reported in table [ tab : ionization ] .",

    "we establish that the donor electron is slightly more bound to the nucleus with an increasing field , for small fields , and calculate field thresholds at which ionization is expected to occur , for each donor .",
