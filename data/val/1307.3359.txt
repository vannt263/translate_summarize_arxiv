    "einstein s equations admit black hole solutions , and gravitational collapse in general relativity inevitably leads to the formation of these objects , as shown by the celebrated singularity theorems  @xcite .",
    "observational evidence for the existence of black holes is strong as well , both in the `` stellar - mass '' range ( @xmath0  @xmath1 ) , and in the `` supermassive '' range ( @xmath2  @xmath3 ) . in the stellar - mass range ,",
    "black - hole candidates in x - ray binaries are too heavy to be neutron stars or quark stars with reasonable equations of state  @xcite ; in the supermassive range , observations of stars around the black - hole candidate in the center of the milky way ( sgra@xmath4 ) show that this object is too compact and massive to be a dark cluster of low - luminosity bodies  @xcite or a fermion star  @xcite .",
    "also , near - infrared observations of sgra@xmath4 seem to provide circumstantial evidence that this object has an event horizon ( because if it had a surface , it would emit radiation , _ e.g. _",
    "thermally , and be more luminous than observed )  @xcite , thus disfavoring more exotic horizon - less alternatives such as boson stars or gravastars .",
    "similar observations also exist in low - mass x - ray binaries for stellar - mass black - hole candidates , which do not show the type - i bursts that would be expected from the interaction of the accreting gas with their surface , if they had one  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the current paradigms for quasars and active galactic nuclei , as well as for the formation of galaxies , also require that supermassive black holes be present in the center of almost every galaxy .",
    "in fact , stellar and gas dynamical evidence  @xcite and observations of the optical , ultraviolet ( uv ) and x - ray spectrum of active galactic nuclei  @xcite do indeed corroborate this assumption .",
    "the defining characteristic of a black hole is , as mentioned above , the presence of an event horizon . that is a causal boundary that separates ( or defines ) the interior and exterior of a black hole , and prevents any signal originating from the interior from reaching the exterior .",
    "the reason why spacetimes that posses an event horizon can exist in general relativity is rooted in the causal structure of the theory .",
    "the latter is inherited from special relativity , and confines signals , irrespective of their nature , to propagate within future - directed light cones .",
    "although event horizons depend in general on the global structure of the spacetime , in static , spherically symmetric spacetimes ( and in stationary , slowly rotating ones , which we will also consider here ) they are usually discussed in terms of the structure of light cones in a well - behaved coordinate system , i.e.  they correspond to the location where these light cones `` tilt '' and cease allowing signals to propagate `` outwards '' .",
    "it is , therefore , clear that local lorentz invariance , being the symmetry underpinning special and general relativity , is central to the existence of black holes .",
    "it is then natural to wonder what happens to horizons and black holes if lorentz invariance is not an exact symmetry of nature .",
    "intuitively , the answer to this question seems to depend on the way local lorentz symmetry is violated , and on how this affects the causal structure of the theory .",
    "consider for instance a theory with a preferred frame , but where all excitations have linear dispersion relations .",
    "lorentz symmetry is then broken by the existence of a preferred frame , and certain modes may perhaps propagate faster than light in that frame , but all propagating modes have a finite speed",
    ". therefore , there are still `` propagation cones '' in such a lorentz - violating theory , and the causal structure remains qualitatively similar to general relativity .",
    "the modification that one may expect at the level of black holes is the presence of multiple horizons , i.e. modes propagating at different speeds would have different causal boundaries .",
    "however , there is no particular reason why dispersion relations should be linear once lorentz symmetry has been given up .",
    "consider instead dispersion relations [ mdsr ] ^2k^2+k^4 +  , where @xmath5 is the frequency , @xmath6 the wave - number , @xmath7 a constant with appropriate dimensions , and the dispersion relation can potentially include higher powers of @xmath6 .",
    "perturbations with sufficiently large @xmath6 can then travel arbitrarily fast in the preferred frame",
    ". therefore , there are no propagation cones , and the causal structure is drastically different from special and general relativity , as the existence of a preferred frame and infinite - speed propagation imply the existence of hypersurfaces of simultaneity .",
    "the very notion of a black hole does not seem to fit in this framework .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that if one were to start with a theory with a higher - order dispersion relation , and then truncate it to order @xmath8 as a result of some low - momentum approximation , then the picture would drastically change into the one depicted above for a linear dispersion relation .",
    "so , one could say that excitations with sufficiently low momenta experience the existence of an event horizons , but more energetic ones would be able to escape them .",
    "alternatively , one could say that the existence of horizons is a low - energy artefact .",
    "this conclusion is obviously based on highly heuristic arguments and lacks a firm mathematical basis .",
    "it does , however , act as the motivation and starting point for a rigorous exploration of what happens to the notion of a black hole in gravitational theories that exhibit violations of lorentz invariance .",
    "this is indeed the purpose of this paper .",
    "we stress that this is not a purely academic question .",
    "as discussed above , the astrophysical evidence for the existence of black holes is rather convincing , and observations allow us to determine the characteristics of objects with ever - increasing accuracy .",
    "hence , black holes can be powerful laboratories for gravity , and in particular they can be used to constrain violations of local lorentz symmetry in the gravity sector .",
    "such constraints would be complementary to the very stringent constraints already existing for lorentz - symmetry violations in the matter sector  @xcite .",
    "quantifying the potential violations of symmetries that are considered as fundamental is an important goal in itself , but it requires a theoretical framework providing predictions to be confronted with observations .",
    "einstein - aether theory (  - theory ) @xcite has been quite successful at playing this role when it comes to lorentz - invariance violations in gravity .",
    " - theory is essentially general relativity coupled to a vector field ( the aether ) , which is constrained to have unit norm and be timelike .",
    "being of unit length , the aether can not vanish , and thus breaks boost invariance by defining ( locally ) a preferred frame .",
    "recently , additional motivation for lorentz - violating gravity theories has been put forward : hoava has suggested that giving up lorentz symmetry can lead to considerably better uv properties , and it appears possible to put together a power - counting renormalizable lorentz - violating theory of gravity  @xcite .",
    "this could be a pay - off significant enough to entertain the idea that lorentz symmetry might indeed be approximate , and not exact , in the gravity sector",
    ".    we will give a brief overview of both  - theory and hoava gravity in section [ framework ] .",
    "in connection with what we discussed above , it is worth pointing out that dispersion relations are linear in the former , and higher - order in the latter .",
    "moreover , the low - energy limit of hoava gravity , which is a truncation of the theory at second order in derivatives , has been shown to be dynamically equivalent to  - theory , provided that the aether is forced to be hypersurface - orthogonal at the level of the action @xcite .",
    "together , the two theories form an excellent theoretical framework for rigorously exploring the fate of black holes once local lorentz symmetry is violated . in section [ sphbh ]",
    "we indeed investigate static , spherically symmetric , asymptotically flat black holes in the two theories , following the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , while in section [ slowly_rotating ] we move away from spherical symmetry and focus on slowly - rotating black holes ( partially following refs .",
    "@xcite but providing independent derivations of the results of those papers , and clarifying their physical interpretation ) .",
    "section [ cons ] contains our conclusions .    in this paper",
    ", we use a metric signature @xmath9 and units where @xmath10 .",
    "the action for  - theory is [ s ] s_ =   ( -r -m^ _ _ u^_u^ )  d^4x where @xmath11 is the ricci scalar , @xmath12 the determinant of the metric @xmath13 , and m^ _ = c_1 g^g_+c_2^_^ _ + c_3 ^_^_+c_4 u^u^g _ , with @xmath14 being the covariant derivative associated to @xmath15 and @xmath16 being dimensionless coupling constants .",
    "also , @xmath17 is constrained to be a unit timelike vector , i.e. g_u^u^=1 .",
    "this can be explicitly imposed by adding the lagrange multiplier term @xmath18 to the action , or it can be taken into account implicitly during the variation .",
    "this constraint is a key feature of  - theory : by virtue of it , the aether can never vanish , and always points to some timelike direction .",
    "so , in the locally flat coordinate system where @xmath15 becomes the minkowski metric , the aether breaks boost invariance , leading to violations of lorentz symmetry and defining a preferred frame .",
    "consider now a restricted version of  - theory where the aether is always hypersurface - orthogonal .",
    "then , one can express the aether in terms of a scalar @xmath19 as [ ho ] u_= , where the unit constraint has already been taken into account . because the aether must be timelike",
    ", @xmath19 defines a time coordinate , and one can choose to foliate spacetime into constant-@xmath19 hypersurfaces . in this adapted foliation , one has [ preferred foliation ] u_=_^t ( g^tt)^-1/2=n_^t , where @xmath20 is the lapse function , and the action takes the form [ sbpsh ] s_h.o. = dt d^3x n ( k_ijk^ij - k^2 + ^(3)r + a_ia^i ) , where @xmath21 is the extrinsic curvature of the constant-@xmath19 hypersurfaces , @xmath22 is the induced spatial metric , @xmath23 its ricci curvature , and a_i=_i is the acceleration of the aether flow .",
    "we have also introduced new parameters which are given in terms of those appearing in action ( [ s ] ) as [ hlpar ] = = , = , = , where @xmath24 .",
    "only three coupling constants appear in action ( [ sbpsh ] ) , as opposed to the four @xmath16 in action ( [ s ] ) .",
    "this is because for a hypersurface - orthogonal aether field , any one of the @xmath25 , @xmath26 or @xmath27 terms can be expressed in terms of the other two without loss of generality .",
    "action ( [ sbpsh ] ) is what is referred to as the low - energy ( or infrared ) limit of hoava gravity . in its complete version",
    "the action of hoava gravity is @xcite [ sbpshfull ] s_hl= dt d^3x n(l_2+l_4+l_6 ) , where [ l2 ] l_2 = k_ijk^ij - k^2 + ^(3)r + a_ia^i , @xmath28 is a new mass scale , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are respectively of fourth and sixth order in the spatial derivatives , but contain no derivatives with respect to @xmath19 .",
    "the presence of sixth - order terms in the spatial derivatives is crucial for power - counting renormalizability @xcite . a more precise prescription to construct @xmath29 and",
    "@xmath30 follows from the symmetries of the low - energy part of the action .",
    "action ( [ sbpsh ] ) is written in a preferred foliation of @xmath31 constant hypersurfaces , and the existence of this foliation is essential for the addition of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 terms .",
    "the action is invariant under diffeomorphisms that preserve this foliation , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , but not under arbitrary diffeomorphisms .",
    "therefore , @xmath29 and @xmath30 should contain ( respectively ) all forth and sixth - order terms that are compatible with this symmetry . in practice , this means that @xmath29 and @xmath30 can contain any 3-dimensional scalar constructed with @xmath34 , @xmath22 and their ( spatial ) derivatives .",
    "we have deliberately chosen to introduce hoava gravity through its relation with  - theory for various reasons ( see also ref .",
    "first , the relation between the two theories will be extensively used in what follows .",
    "second , this choice shows that hoava gravity can be written in a covariant manner .",
    "third , it makes it straightforward to argue that the theory has an extra scalar degree of freedom ( since the transverse mode of the aether disappears due to the hypersurface - orthogonality condition ) , which becomes apparent and defines the preferred foliation .",
    "note that different versions of hoava gravity exist with extra symmetries , or different field content @xcite , but we will not consider them here ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a brief review ) .",
    "the presence of terms of fourth and sixth order in the spatial derivatives leads to higher - order dispersion relations for the spin-2 graviton and the scalar degree of freedom , such as those discussed in the introduction . in  - theory instead , all degrees of freedom have linear dispersion relations .",
    "the same property is shared by the low - energy limit of hoava gravity , but is an artefact of the truncation .",
    "thus , in combination , the two theories do indeed act as an excellent framework to address the issues raised in the introduction .",
    "the precise form of @xmath29 and @xmath30 will _ not _ be crucial for what follows .",
    "finding black hole solutions when those terms are included is very challenging from a computational and numerical point of view , so here we will rather focus on  - theory and the low - energy part of hoava gravity .",
    "in particular , we will look for spacetimes with a metric horizon .",
    "this is a null hypersurface of the covariant 4-dimensional metric ( which couples minimally to the matter fields , as required by the weak equivalence principle ) , and acts as causal horizon for those fields . besides the metric horizon",
    ", these solutions are expected to possess different causal horizons for the propagating modes that reside in the gravity sector ( i.e.  the spin-2 and spin-0 modes of hoava gravity , and the spin-2 , spin-1 and spin-0 modes of  - theory ) , because these modes will generically travel at superluminal or subluminal speeds .",
    "these horizons will be null surfaces of the effective metrics @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the speed of the spin-@xmath37 mode ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion ) . we will then proceed and discuss the effect the higher - order derivative terms @xmath29 and @xmath30 on the causal structure of these spacetimes , and discuss whether they really deserve to be called `` black holes '' .",
    "our analysis hinges on the assumption that @xmath28 is a sufficiently large mass scale , so that the presence of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 terms does not really affect the spacetime geometry in regions of interest for our analysis .",
    "this will be discussed in detail in the next section .",
    "@xmath28 is indeed bound from below from tests of lorentz symmetry . in particular , purely gravitational experiments impose the mild bound @xmath38 ev .",
    "test of lorentz symmetry in the matter sector can lead to constraints that are many orders of magnitude higher for @xmath28 , but which depend strongly on the details of the percolations of lorentz - symmetry breaking from the gravity to the matter sector @xcite .",
    "@xmath28 is also , perhaps more surprisingly , bound from above ( @xmath39 gev ) , from the requirement that the theory behave perturbatively at all scales @xcite , so that the power - counting renormalizability arguments put forth in ref .",
    "@xcite actually apply .",
    "we conclude this brief overview of  - theory , hoava gravity and their mutual relation with a brief discussion of their field equations . varying the action ( [ s ] ) with respect to the metric @xmath40 and the aether @xmath41 , in the absence of matter fields and taking into account the unit constraint , yields [ gfe ] e _ & & - ( g _ - t^_)=0 , + [ aeeq ]  _ & & ( _ j^-c_4_^u^ ) ( g_-u_u_)=0 where @xmath42 is the einstein tensor , [ tae ] t^_&=&_(j^_(u_)-j^_(u_)-j_()u^ ) + & & + c_1 + & & + u_u_+c_4 _ _ - l_ g _ , is the aether stress - energy tensor , and j^_=m^ _ _",
    "u^ _ = u^_u_. taking instead the variation with respect to @xmath40 and @xmath43 one obtains , again in the absence of matter fields and taking into account the unit constraint , e_+_(u_)=0,[einsteinae ] + _=0[aeeq2 ] .",
    "these equations are clearly equivalent to the system   and , and either set of equations represents the full field equations of  - theory .",
    "( we will use both forms of the field equations in what follows ) .    imposing the constraint before the variation , and then varying the action ( [ s ] ) with respect to @xmath44 and @xmath19 yields [ hl1 ] & & e_+_(u_)=0 , + [ hleq ] & & _ ( ) = 0 , keeping the same notation as above .",
    "these are the equations of the low - energy limit of hoava gravity in covariant form .    based on the above , it is straightforward to see that solutions of  - theory for which the aether is hypersurface - orthogonal will be solutions of the low - energy limit of hoava gravity as well , but the converse is not necessarily true .",
    "we also note that in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that in the low - energy limit of hoava gravity , equation   is actually implied by equation   thanks to the bianchi identity .",
    "this is something that we will use in section  [ slowly_rotating ] .      the parameters @xmath16 define a 4-dimensional parameter space for  - theory .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    particularly strong constraints follow from the requirement that the two theories reproduce the weak - field predictions of general relativity in the presence of matter ( i.e. when one adds matter fields minimally coupled to the metric ) .",
    "one can indeed perform a post - newtonian expansion , as in general relativity , and cast the results into the usual parametrized post - newtonian ( ppn ) framework  @xcite . in both theories ,",
    "all ppn parameters turn out to be identical to those of general relativity except two  @xcite , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "these parameters measure preferred - frame effects , and are experimentally constrained to very small values , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , in agreement with the predictions of general relativity , where @xmath52 . requiring",
    "then that @xmath48 and @xmath49 vanish exactly , we obtain c_2=,c_4=- , for  - theory and = 2 - 2 for hoava gravity , and we are therefore left with a two - dimensional parameter space for both theories . requiring vanishing preferred frame parameters might seem a strong requirement .",
    "however , since @xmath48 and @xmath49 are dimensionless , if one allows @xmath48 and @xmath49 to take values that are nonzero but satisfy the observational constraints , then the predictions of both theories will be close to those obtained for @xmath52 to within an accuracy @xmath53 , and it is therefore convenient to decrease the dimension of the parameter space by setting @xmath48 and @xmath49 exactly to zero .",
    "it is sensible to ask that all of the propagating modes of the two theories have positive energy and be free of gradient instabilities in flat space .",
    "additionally , there should be no modes propagating subluminally .",
    "if this were the case , matter could decay into these modes via a erenkov - like process , and this would lead to observable effects @xcite .",
    "these requirements impose further constraints onto the parameters of the two theories , identifying only specific regions of the aforementioned 2-dimensional surface as viable .",
    "details can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we limit ourselves to show a plot of the allowed part of the parameter space in figure  [ parspace ] .",
    "the following redefinitions of parameters allow for a better visualisation : c_=c_1c_3 ; = /-1 , = ( -1)/ , we stress that there are further constraints on lorentz - violating gravity theories that could further restrict the viable parameter space .",
    "binary - pulsar observations have long been known to carry the potential for constraining the couplings to regions near the origin in the @xmath54 and @xmath55 planes  @xcite , but calculations have become sufficiently accurate for imposing precise constraints only very recently  @xcite .",
    "similarly , cosmological observations of the cosmic microwave background and the matter power spectrum constrain the couplings to values of order unity or less  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we focus here on the regions of the parameter spaces where @xmath56 and @xmath57 , since larger values of the couplings are unlikely to be compatible with these observations .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the derivation and main physical properties of spherically symmetric , static and asymptotically flat black holes in both low - energy hoava gravity ( referred to simply as hoava gravity from now on ) and  - theory . for a more detailed discussion , see ref .",
    "@xcite , where these solutions were derived .      first , let us note that spherically symmetric , static and asymptotically flat black holes are actually exactly the same in the two theories  @xcite .",
    "this fact is not obvious .",
    "a spherically symmetric , static aether vector field is always hypersurface - orthogonal and therefore , as discussed at the end of section [ aeandhl ] , such solutions of  - theory will also be solutions of hoava gravity , but the converse is not generically true .",
    "however , it can be shown to hold for spherically symmetric , static and asymptotically flat solutions . inserting the spherically symmetric and static anstze @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( with @xmath60 satisfying the unit constraint @xmath61 ) into equation  , one straightforwardly obtains that @xmath62 identically , while @xmath63 implies @xmath64 .",
    "so , in order to show that any solution of hoava gravity is also a solution of  - theory , it is sufficient to prove that equation   implies @xmath63 .",
    "this can be seen by integrating equation   ( which contains only @xmath65 and @xmath66 derivatives because of the spherically symmetric static ansatz ) between two arbitrary radii @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",

    "let us first note that hypersurface - orthogonality of the aether implies vanishing vorticity vector @xmath253 . using this and the requirement that the aether be stationary and axisymmetric ( hence @xmath254 ) ,",
    "one obtains that it must be @xmath255 , where @xmath256 is a constant ( of order @xmath202 , due to the slow - rotation assumption ) . as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , a coordinate change @xmath207 can then be shown to transform @xmath257 to zero , without affecting the metric ansatz  . therefore ,",
    "if one imposes hypersurface - orthogonality for the aether , it is not restrictive to set @xmath258 in equations  . one can then combine these equations into a first - order equation for @xmath259 , namely @xmath260=0\\ , .",

    "@xcite defined in equation ( 21 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , which was shown to be non - zero there . ]",
    ", it follows that @xmath262 constant .",
    "however , as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , this is simply the background static spherically symmetric solution under a coordinate change @xmath185 , so no slowly rotating black - hole solutions exist in  - theory if the aether is required to be hypersurface - orthogonal .",
    "therefore , no universal horizons seem to exist in  - theory s slowly rotating black holes , at least in the sense defined in section  [ uhor ] , because no global preferred - time foliation exists in the first place .      as discussed in section  [ framework ] , the einstein equations for hoava gravity coincide with the einstein equations for  - theory , provided that those are derived by varying @xmath263 and keeping @xmath43 fixed and that the aether is hypersurface - orthogonal  @xcite ( c.f .",
    "equations and ) .",
    "as we also stressed , the bianchi identity implies  @xcite that the hoava gravity einstein equations also include equation ( which follows from a variation of the action with respect to @xmath19 ) , so one does not need to impose equation explicitly when solving equations .    the only two independent fields equations at order @xmath202 are then given by the @xmath264 and @xmath265 components of the einstein equations .",
    "the former is given by equation  , and proceeding as in  - theory , it implies @xmath190 .",
    "the latter is then given by equation  , which because of the hypersurface orthogonality condition ( which as discussed above implies @xmath266 ) becomes @xmath267\\right\\}=0\\ ] ] ( where we have used the fact , proved in section  [ spin_ae ] , that @xmath198 and @xmath199 are zero once the spherically symmetric static solution is used to evaluate them ) .",
    "the solution to this equation then reads @xmath268 where @xmath115 is the location of the metric horizon , while @xmath269 and @xmath201 are integration constants .",
    "in particular , because asymptotic flatness imposes @xmath270 far from the black hole , from a comparison with the kerr solution of general relativity , it is clear that @xmath269 plays the role of the black - hole spin .",
    "also , it should be noted that @xmath201 can be eliminated with a coordinate transformation @xmath271 .    clearly , because the aether vector field does not present any terms at order @xmath202 , the preferred - time foliation is also unaffected at that order , and the slowly rotating solutions have the same universal horizon as the static spherically symmetric black holes reviewed in section  [ sphbh ] .",
    "we have reviewed spherically symmmetric static black - hole solutions  @xcite in  - theory and in the infrared limit of hoava gravity . in order to focus on the black holes that are expected to exist in the real universe ( e.g. ones forming from gravitational collapse )",
    ", we impose that the geometry of our solutions be regular everywhere apart from the central singularity  @xcite . because the matter fields ( which couple minimally to the metric ) and the propagating modes of the gravity sector have different propagation speeds in these theories , these black - hole solutions present multiple horizons , i.e. a `` metric '' horizon for the matter fields , as well as spin-0 , spin-1 and spin-2 horizons for the various modes that reside in the gravity sector .",
    "we have compared the geometry of these black holes ( outside the metric horizon ) to that of the schwarzschild solution of general relativity , and we have discussed the prospects of constraining the differences with future electromagnetic and gravitational - wave probes .",
    "lorentz - violating gravity theories are generically expected to have propagating modes that can travel arbitrarily fast in the uv limit .",
    "this would make the very concept of event horizon ( and therefore of a black hole ) meaningless , because modes with sufficiently high energies would be allowed to escape the multiple horizons mentioned above and probe the central singularity . however , the examples we studied here demonstrate that , when there is a preferred foliation , a new kind of horizon can exist , and it acts as a causal boundary for all modes , even instantaneous ones .",
    "the nonlinear stability of universal horizon certainly requires further investigation @xcite .",
    "we have also investigated whether such universal horizons exist for slowly rotating black holes , and we have shown that they do indeed exist for hoava gravity , while they do not seem to be present in  - theory  @xcite .",
    "the reason for that is that slowly rotating black holes in  - theory do not posses a preferred foliation .",
    "we are indebted to ted jacobson for countless stimulating conversations and insightful suggestions .",
