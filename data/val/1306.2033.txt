    "in the galactic center dwells the nearest supermassive black hole with a mass @xmath2 , measured by observations of the orbital parameters of the fast moving s0 stars @xcite .",
    "the major problem with observations of the supermassive black hole sgra * in the galactic center is that it is a ` dormant ' quasar , i.e. , nearly completely inactive with a very rare splashing of activity .",
    "nevertheless , there are serendipitous observations of ( quasi - periodic oscillations ) qpos from sgra * with a sufficiently high statistical significance in the x - rays @xcite and in the near - infrared @xcite .",
    "it is demonstrated below the ability of the qpo observations for the measuring of both the mass and spin of the astrophysical black holes .",
    "the usual interpretation relates qpos with the resonances in the accretion disks @xcite .",
    "a weak point of the resonance qpo interpretation is the ambiguity caused by the dependence on the accretion model used .",
    "it seems that the resonance qpo models are applicable to black holes in the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and in the stellar binaries with the high accretion rates .",
    "the others promising approaches for revealing the black hole rotation are the continuum fitting method for the relativistic accretion disk models @xcite , the modelling of the spectral lines broadening in the accretion flow @xcite and correlation between jet power and black hole spin @xcite .",
    "these approaches also depend on the used accretion models .",
    "what is described below is the alternative qpo interpretation , related to the oscillation frequencies of the numerous hot spots in the accretion plasma @xcite , which are independent of the accretion model and defined completely by the properties of the black hole gravitational field . in this interpretation",
    "the qpos instead of the pure periodic ones result from the simultaneous emission of numerous clumps of hot plasma , existing in the accretion flow at different radial distances from black hole @xcite .",
    "the described approach is directly applicable to black holes with a low accretion rate , when accreting plasma is transparent up to the event horizon region .",
    "it is supposed that hot spots are generated in the accretion flow by plasma instability and turbulence .",
    "these hot spots will be viewed by the distant observer on the disk surface in the case of the optically thick accretion .",
    "the hot spots are directly produced in the magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion flow @xcite .",
    "the supermassive black hole in the galactic center is the most favorable case .",
    "this supermassive black hole is activated from time to time by the episodic accretion of tidally disrupted stars @xcite , accompanied by the formation of shocks , jets and acceleration of cosmic rays @xcite . especially crucial for the electromagnetic extraction of energy from black holes and for the efficiency of generation and acceleration of cosmic rays is the value of kerr metric angular momentum @xcite .",
    "the nonrotating spherically symmetric schwarzschild black holes seems to be very exotic objects in the universe .",
    "a typical black hole must rotate rather fast , obtaining angular momentum either from the collapsing progenitor massive star , or after the coalescence with an other black hole , or due to the spinning up by an accretion matter .",
    "we use units with @xmath3 and define the spin parameter of kerr black hole as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are , respectively , the black hole mass and angular momentum .    approaching to the extreme kerr black hole state with @xmath7 is only possible as an infinite limiting process @xcite , according to the third law of the black hole ( thermo)dynamics @xcite . in the case of the astrophysically interesting thin disk accretion ,",
    "the black hole will finally spin up to the `` canonical '' value of the kerr spin parameter @xmath8 , which corresponds to the untwisting black hole in the thin disk model under the back reaction influence of the accreting flow @xcite .",

    "<S> quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) of the hot plasma spots or clumps orbiting an accreting black hole contain information on the black hole mass and spin . </S>",
    "<S> the promising observational signatures for the measurement of black hole mass and spin are the latitudinal oscillation frequency of the bright spots in the accretion flow and the frequency of black hole event horizon rotation . </S>",
    "<S> both of these frequencies are independent of the accretion model and defined completely by the properties of the black hole gravitational field . </S>",
    "<S> interpretation of the known qpo data by dint of a signal modulation from the hot spots in the accreting plasma reveals the kerr metric rotation parameter , @xmath0 , and mass , @xmath1 , of the supermassive black hole in the galactic center . at the same time , the observed 11.5 min qpo period is identified with a period of the black hole event horizon rotation , and , respectively , the 19 min period is identified with a latitudinal oscillation period of hot spots in the accretion flow . </S>",
    "<S> the described approach is applicable to black holes with a low accretion rate , when accreting plasma is transparent up to the event horizon region . </S>"
