    "provided that the aligned structure and the multiple components are not simply effervescent froth in comparison to the galaxy as a whole , they may tell us something about the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies .    the @xmath0 quasar 3c190 has been classified as a compact - steep - spectrum ( css ) radio source ; it is also a member of the class of `` red '' quasars , whose optical / ir continua fall steeply towards shorter wavelengths @xcite .",

    "while the southwest hotspot and associated radio jet fall in a region of diffuse emission near the point of closest approach of the linear feature @xmath11 to the quasar , there is no clear correlation between the radio and optical structure on the wfpc2 image . some of the strong [ ] emission to the south of 3c190 appears to fall along the south - eastern side of the radio jet , but the correlation is not so strong that a physical association between the two is compelling , at least from the imaging data alone .",

    "the region around the [ ] @xmath4 doublet in our best two - dimensional spectrum of the linear feature ( that of ut 1998 feb 17 ) was deconvolved using a kernel generated from the continuum of the quasar ( for the spatial dimension ) and the profile of a strong airglow line ( for the spectral dimension ) .",

    "the low - velocity - dispersion gas shows an abrupt velocity dislocation at the position of the main gap in the linear feature , which corresponds to component @xmath22 in the @xmath5 image . the overall impression ( as traced by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ oiivel ] ) is that of a disk rotation curve , but with a velocity amplitude twice that of typical giant disk galaxies in the local universe .",
    "alternatively , the velocities could represent bipolar outflow ( or infall ) , or they could simply mean that the two parts of the so - called linear feature are distinct and separate objects .",
    "the summed spectrum of the linear feature to the northwest of the gap is shown as the solid trace at the top of the left panel in fig .",
    "[ linspec ] .",
    "there are at least two remarkable features of this spectrum : the inflection in the slope of the continuum near the position of the [ ] @xmath4 doublet , and the absence of any evidence for h@xmath39 emission .",
    "we consider this second point first .",
    "although the only emission obvious in this spectrum besides the [ ] doublet is the [ ] @xmath28 line , the ratio of [ ] to [ ] intensities ( 0.14 ) is quite consistent with that found in moderately high ionization regions ; _",
    "e.g. , _  the giant region in the lmc , 30 doradus , has a ratio of 0.16 @xcite . if we take 30 doradus and two other regions listed by @xcite as having [ ] / [ ] ratios similar to that we find for 3c190 , the average [ ] /h@xmath40 intensity ratio is @xmath41 .",
    "on the other hand , some regions in the sample of @xcite have [ ] /h@xmath40 intensity ratios ranging up to @xmath42 ( and even slightly beyond ) , so we use this value to calculate a rough lower limit to the expected h@xmath39 intensity . taking this lower limit as the actual intensity , and assuming case b recombination for a temperature of @xmath43 k",
    ", we can construct a template emission - line spectrum consisting of the balmer lines , the [ ] @xmath29,3729 doublet , and the [ ] @xmath44,3967 lines ( where we simply fit gaussian profiles to the forbidden lines and use the fact that the ratio of the [ ] @xmath45 photon flux to that of the @xmath28 line is set by atomic parameters to be 1:3 ) .",
    "we subtract this template from the original spectrum .    at this point",
    "we could attempt to fit this residual with some combination of scattered quasar radiation and stellar spectral synthesis models .",
    "unfortuately , the broad line in the quasar spectrum does not prove to be a useful constraint on the amount of scattered light because of its relatively low equivalent width with respect to the s / n in the spectrum of the linear feature .",
    "a better constraint can be obtained by comparing the flux density from knots in the linear structure with that of direct radiation from the quasar . assuming the depth along the line - of - sight is comparable to the characteristic diameter in the plane of the sky , and assuming 100% scattering efficiency of the incident quasar light , we find the contribution of scattered quasar light to be @xmath46% of the total observed continuum . as the actual scattering efficiency is likely to be more like 20% at best , and projection effects may be important , we are almost certainly safe in ignoring this scattered contribution .",
    "assuming , then , that the residual continuum is dominated by stellar radiation , we obtain a fair fit over most of the range with a solar - metallicity stellar population with an age of @xmath47 years , but there remains a steep dropoff shortward of 2500   .",
    "we can do considerably better by using a two - component stellar population , as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ linspec ] , but , if we optimize the fit over the 25004200   region , the residual still has too little flux below 2500  .",
    "this shortage is at least partly caused by an apparent dip between 2100    and 2400   , which can be seen at some level in the original data .",
    "this dip is very likely the 2175  dust extinction feature found in the galactic extinction law , although @xcite found it to be generally absent in a sample of 39 starburst galaxies .",
    "we model the extinction by taking the galactic extinction law , modified by including isotropic scattering ( see * ? ? ?",
    "10 ) , and then normalizing this curve to the @xcite effective extinction curve for wavelengths far from the 2175    feature .",
    "we then adjust the optical depth to achieve the best cancellation of the feature ( in the spectrum as originally observed ) , as judged by eye .",
    "the resulting corrected spectrum is shown as the upper trace in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ linspec ] .",
    "we now repeat the fitting and subtraction of emission lines and nebular thermal continuum , as described above .",
    "we fit the remaining continuum as the sum of two spectral synthesis models : one with an age of 2 myr , and one with an age of 360 myr . the residual from subtracting the nebular component and the two stellar components from the extinction - corrected spectrum",
    "is shown in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ linspec ] .",
    "the many uncertainties of this exercise , particularly in estimating both the wavelength dependence and the amplitude of the extinction correction , prevent us from claiming any quantitative validity for the results .",
    "however , we believe that certain qualitative results are fairly robust : ( 1 . )",
    "the inflection in the observed continuum indicates the presence of a few - hundred - myr - old population , whose balmer absorption lines are partially masked by emission lines .",
    "the inflection is present in the data before the extinction correction ; while the age of this component is dependent on the amount of extinction and the modeling of any younger population , it almost certain has to be in the range 2@xmath48 years .",
    "( 2 ) there is a significant level of extinction .",
    "this conclusion is based on the difficulty of obtaining a satisfactory fit to the observed spectrum using spectral synthesis models and the evidence for a dip near 2200  .",
    "( 3 ) a very young stellar component is present , consistent with current ongoing star formation .",
    "this component is required to obtain a decent fit to the spectrum , particularly if any significant extinction is included , and it would provide the most logical source of ionization for the observed emission - line spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , ( 4 ) this actively starforming component comprises only a small fraction of the stellar mass ( the formal value for our specific model is @xmath49% ) . if our model is close to being accurate , we estimate a total stellar mass of @xmath50 for each of the three brightest regions",
    ".      there are a number of galaxies clustered around 3c190 , mostly to the north .",
    "the brightest of these have @xmath51 .",

    "[ galsed ] .    of these , galaxy @xmath26 comes close to fitting an essentially unreddened old stellar population at the quasar redshift , whereas galaxies @xmath23 and @xmath25 would be consistent with reddened younger populations .",

    "[ 3c190sl ] ) .",

    "this object shows [ ] @xmath4 emission at @xmath52 , on an extremely weak continuum .",
    "the other galaxy was @xmath23 in fig .",
    "[ 3c190mos ] ( see also fig .  [ galsed ] ) ; it has a stronger continuum , with a slight slope upwards towards the red across the rest - frame uv range , and it shows [ ] @xmath4 and [ ] @xmath28 emission at @xmath53 .",
    "the faint emission - line galaxy @xmath27  to the northwest and fortuitously on our slit placed through the linear feature ( see fig .  [ decon ] ) has @xmath54 .",
    "( it also has very high ionization , with [ ] @xmath55 as strong as [ ] @xmath28 . )",
    "these observations indicate that we can safely assume that most of the dozen or so small galaxies within @xmath56  ( @xmath57 kpc ) radius of 3c190 are associated , and it is likely that many at larger distances are as well .",
    "the galaxies in the immediate vicinity of the quasar host form a compact group which must almost certainly shortly merge with it .",
    "we can make an estimate of the total stellar mass in all of the objects in the immediate vicinity of 3c190 from the psf - subtracted @xmath5 image .",
    "we use a 4-radius aperture , centered 08 east and 16 north of the quasar , which includes the quasar host galaxy as well as objects @xmath22@xmath26 .",
    "if we assume that there is no significant extinction at this wavelength ( restframe 9600  ) and that the stellar population can be modelled as a single burst 5 gyr old with a salpeter initial mass function , we will have a fairly firm lower limit to the stellar mass . by scaling a @xcite model to the observed flux density",
    ", we obtain a mass of @xmath58 . the mass obtained is not too sensitive to the age of the stellar population for ages @xmath59 gyr ; _",
    "e.g. , _  if we assume an age of 1 gyr , we only double the mass .",
    "very little of the mass can be in stars much younger than 1 gyr unless the extinction in regions containing such stars is extremely high .",
    "if our quasar psf subtraction is reasonably accurate , the fraction of the stellar mass within 1  (= 8 kpc ) of the quasar ( corresponding roughly to the quasar host galaxy ) is @xmath60 .",
    "there is a bewildering variety of phenomena found in the vicinity of 3c190 , and the manner in which each relates to the rest is not at all obvious .",
    "we summarize here the main features and what we take to be their most plausible interpretations .",
    "the narrow , low - surface - brightness features @xmath20 and @xmath21 are seen best in the keck @xmath5 image but are also visible in the @xmath19 image .",
    "if these are tidal tails , as seems possible , they indicate a past major merger .",
    "the tight grouping of small galaxies , mostly on the north side , is projected on low - surface - brightness extended material ( seen best on the _ hst _ and @xmath19 images ) .",
    "our spectroscopy shows that at least two of these are associated with 3c190 , and the high local density of these objects suggests that most of the others are associated as well .",
    "the richness and compactness of this group indicates that the 3c190 host galaxy is subjected to a continuing rain of minor ( and some fairly major ) mergers .",
    "the high surface brightness , high - velocity - dispersion emission - line gas extends mostly to the south .",
    "it appears to start out in almost the same direction as the low - surface - brightness feature @xmath20 , but it is probably associated instead in some way with the radio emission , though it is only loosely correlated with it in position .",
    "the long linear feature @xmath11 remains enigmatic , even though we have learned quite a bit about its stellar content and velocity structure .",
    "it is still well defined in our @xmath19 image , which is dominated by light longward of 4000   in the rest frame .",
    "this means that the stars a few @xmath1 years old that we find in our spectroscopy of the feature are dynamically associated with it , rather than being part of the general diffuse background seen around the quasar . at shorter wavelengths ,",
    "the feature is dominated by the large star - forming complexes that provide the ionization for the low - velocity - dispersion ( lvd ) gas .",
    "it is the apparent velocity structure for this lvd gas that makes the interpretation of this feature difficult .",
    "the velocity curve is consistent with that of a disk embedded in an extremely massive halo ( @xmath61 within a 25 kpc radius ) ; but the combination of the extreme rarity of such objects , the association with ( but clear offset from ) 3c190 , and the necessity that we would be observing the object almost exactly edge on , makes this interpretation difficult to accept .",
    "collimated outflow makes even less sense , given the clear indication of a significant mass of stars and the fact that the supposed outflow would have to originate , not at the quasar , but at or near object @xmath22 . on the whole ,",
    "a close connection with the `` chain galaxies '' seen frequently at high redshift @xcite seems most likely , although these are themselves poorly understood .",
    "furthermore , this interpretation does nothing to explain the observed velocity structure .",
    "if the feature is interpreted as two separate chain galaxies at different velocities , then their alignment with each other would be fortuitous .",
    "a remaining , but remote , possibility is that the lvd [ ] emission at the northwest and southeast ends of the feature have independent physical origins , the former being the result of young stars , the latter perhaps being due to precursor ionization from shocks associated with the radio jet .",
    "a prediction of the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario for galaxy formation is that small baryonic structures form first and then merge to form larger structures .",
    "but a persistent problem of the simplest `` building - block '' models , when applied to the formation of spheroids , is the observed correlation between luminosity and color in present - day ellipticals and bulges , implying a correlation between mass and metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if , for example , most of the stars now in cluster ellipticals were already formed in dwarf - galaxy - sized systems , how would the stars acquire the metallicities characteristic of the mass of the galaxy into which they would eventually be incorporated ?",
    "in fact , if the `` building blocks '' are both small and isolated at the time they form most of their stars , they will not easily retain the enriched gas needed to form the later generations of higher metallicity stars .",
    "what we can see happening around 3c190 is indeed the formation of a large number of galaxies with a range of sizes .",
    "some , such as the emission - line galaxy fortuitiously found on our slit some 20  from 3c190 may simply indicate that 3c190 is in a rich environment , possibly a cluster in formation .",
    "others , closer in , appear to be in the process of merging with the 3c190 host galaxy .",
    "but these latter are not isolated entities : some objects are incorporated into a coherent structure with a characteristic dimension of @xmath57 kpc ( whether a disk , chain galaxy , or something else ) ; others appear to be distributed more randomly , but they are still found within a common luminous envelope .",
    "this means that the star formation in these individual building blocks is likely taking place within an already established potential well sufficiently deep to retain the enriched gas for successive generations of star formation .",
    "furthermore , we have observational evidence within the star - forming regions of the linear feature for at least one major previous generation of stars .",
    "all of this means that the distinction between a monolithic picture of bulge or elliptical - galaxy formation _  la _ @xcite and the bottom - up cdm view may not be as clear cut as is sometimes supposed . in the objects within the immediate environment of 3c190 , processes of star formation and assembly into larger aggregates",

    "<S> we present deep imaging and spectroscopic observations of the @xmath0 quasar 3c190 and its immediate environment . </S>",
    "<S> the quasar is surrounded by an asymmetric low - surface - brightness envelope in which there are also several galaxies with characteristic dimensions of 35 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> some of these form a linear structure some 50 kpc long in projection , offset from the quasar and almost perpendicular to the radio axis . </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopy of this feature indicates the presence of a starburst component as well as stars a few @xmath1 years old . </S>",
    "<S> velocities of the emission - line gas associated with regions in the linear feature are difficult to reconcile with any reasonable model that is also consistent with the observed morphology . </S>",
    "<S> one possible scenario is an edge - on disk in an extremely massive ( @xmath2 ) halo ; another is two independent chain galaxies , with the apparent alignment being fortuitous . taking into account all of the types of extended material we find in the vicinity of 3c190 </S>",
    "<S> , we appear to be witnessing a relatively brief phase in the development of a spheroidal galaxy , in which merging is proceeding nearly simultaneously in a variety of different regimes . </S>",
    "<S> this system may be one of the clearest examples yet found for the mechanism by which many elliptical galaxies and bulges of early - type spirals form in the early universe . </S>"
