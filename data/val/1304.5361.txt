    "improvement of solar cell technology as well as cost reduction is an increasingly challenging topic in the quest of renewable energy sources .",
    "one of the strategy currently followed to reduce the fabrication cost is the use of ultrathin active layers .",
    "this approach could help reducing the cost of photovoltaic technologies since a smaller quantity of material is used @xcite .",
    "however , reducing the thickness brings new problems .",
    "the fact that the film thickness could be much lower than the absorption length leads to a significant reduction of the absorption .",
    "ultrathin technologies need solutions to keep solar light absorption high .",
    "one already well - known solution is the use of front - side or / and back - side surface texturing to help coupling incident light into the active layer via light trapping techniques @xcite .",
    "the optimization of light - trapping structures ( see fig . [ fig1](a ) ) in solar cell is still of high interest @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "numerical computations are needed to investigate how electromagnetic field propagates in those devices .",
    "usually , numerical methods used for calculating the absorption inside a solar cell ( finite - difference time - domain method ( fdtd ) @xcite , rigorous coupled wave analysis ( rcwa ) @xcite , ... ) basically consider the cell response under coherent incident light .",
    "unfortunately , it is known that the absorption of an optical device depends on the coherent or incoherent nature of the light .",
    "coherent light leads to oscillations ( such as fabry - perot ) in the absorption spectrum .",
    "incoherent light instead , leads to the disappearance of these oscillations due to destructive - interference effects : a fact that is well known from anyone performing measurements in solar cells .",
    "therefore , the calculated absorption spectrum of the active layer is strongly affected by the choice of the incident source ( coherent or not ) .",
    "since the absorption spectrum is used to determine the photocurrent and the efficiency of solar cells @xcite , it should be recommended to use only incoherent absorption spectrum .",
    "solar light is indeed a strongly incoherent light source : incoming waves from the sun have a finite coherence time ( finite spectral width ) .",
    "the photocurrent @xmath1 supplied by the solar cell is given by : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the absorption spectrum and @xmath4 the global power spectral density of the sun .",
    "in most studies , the absorption spectrum @xmath3 is computed from numerical codes which propagate the electromagnetic field .",
    "nevertheless , such computed @xmath3 is calculated from coherent fields and then we write @xmath5 .",
    "this quantity does not correspond to the required effective incoherent absorption @xmath6 experienced by the solar cell . in order to theoretically predict the performance of a solar cell",
    ", it is therefore very important to improve numerical methods and to take incoherent incident light into account , i.e. to use @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( [ current0 ] ) .",
    "it must be noted that , as far as the propagation of the electric field of incident optical radiation is concerned , a solar cell , whatever the complexity of its structure is , behaves as a linear system ( thanks to maxwell equations ) , which is fully characterized by its scattering matrix ( see appendix [ formalism ] ) .",
    "however , as soon as energy fluxes need to be calculated , linearity does not stand anymore since the intensity ( poynting vector flux ) is proportional to the electric field squared , i.e. @xmath8 . the way the square modulus of the fields enters into the calculation of the absorption ( reflectance , transmittance ) of the system is far from being trivial ( see , for example , the case of rcwa method , in appendix [ rcwa ] ) . in any case",
    ", there exists no transfer function relating _ linearly _ the solar cell absorption to the incident poynting vector flux . the fact that the relevant quantities ( absorbed flux , photocurrent , ... ) do not obey the superposition principle ( since @xmath9 ) prevents us from applying common principles of the linear response theory @xcite .",
    "in particular , the incoherent response can not be treated in the same way as the coherent one , a fact that is known for long time in optics @xcite , at least for simple cases , such as thin films .    in order to overcome this limitation ,",
    "numerical solutions have been proposed for modeling incoherent processes @xcite .",
    "basically , light propagation is computed many times for various incident waves , and the final result relies on a global numerical statistical analysis .",
    "many recipes and algorithms have been proposed to achieve this task . nevertheless , in the present article , we show that it is not necessary to upgrade numerical codes or to perform time consuming statistical analysis in order to deal with incoherent light .",
    "indeed , the efficiency of solar cells under incoherent light illumination can be analytically calculated from the coherent response computed with usual numerical codes , as explained hereafter .",
    "results obtained with our method are compared with those from previous studies .",

    "the absorption coefficient @xmath18 is then given by @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the imaginary part of the permittivity of the active medium of the solar cell and @xmath21 is the power of the incident light .",
    "@xmath22 is the volume of the active domain .",
    "by contrast , if the light is incoherent , the incident electromagnetic field exhibits a time - dependent fluctuating behaviour with a characteristic time @xmath23 , defined as the coherence time of the incident light .",
    "therefore , light inside the active volume can not exhibit the same constructive interference pattern as in the fully coherent case : incoherence affects the way the light propagates .",
    "in addition , a specific medium mainly interacts with light through electronic and ionic motions of its components . as a consequence ,",
    "the response of a medium to an incident electromagnetic wave is not instantaneous and occurs with a given response time @xmath24 related to dielectric relaxation time and/or to charge carrier generation and recombination . if @xmath25 , then the medium undergoes many different field intensity patterns during the characteristic time @xmath24 . as a result ,",
    "the absorption and the generated photocurrent both fluctuate in time .",

    "the main results of appendix [ formalism ] are summarized hereafter .",
    "let us consider an incoherent radiation spectrum , the solar spectrum for instance .",
    "such a spectrum can be considered as constituted by an infinite set of incoherent quasi - monochromatic spectral lines , each line being expressed by the temporal signal : @xmath31 the bracket notation denotes the fact that @xmath32 is a supervector which contains the time - dependent complex fourier components related to each diffraction orders ( see appendix [ rcwa ] ) . @xmath33 describes the incident wave amplitudes , assumed to be non zero only for the zeroth diffraction order ( see fig .",

    "the autocorrelation function of a random process has a spectral representation given by the power spectrum of that process ( wiener kinchine s theorem ) @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath13 can therefore be characterized by its spectral density : @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "we then introduce the normalized incoherence function @xmath38 , @xmath39 which characterizes the incoherence of incident light . assuming that @xmath13 describes a random process which follows a gaussian distribution , the incoherent source illuminating the device is characterized by a gaussian spectral density @xmath40 . as a result",
    ", the incoherence function is simply written as : @xmath41 with a full width at half maximum @xmath42 .",
    "though the coherence time is estimated from the solar spectrum , it must be noted that @xmath40 is not a model of the solar spectrum .",
    "@xmath40 simply describes the stochastic behaviour of each spectral line composing the whole solar spectrum itself .",
    "it can then be shown ( see appendix [ formalism ] ) that the incoherent absorption @xmath26 results from the convolution product , noted @xmath43 , between the coherent absorption @xmath18 and the incoherence function @xmath38 :    @xmath44    this extremely simple formula is easy to use in practice .",

    "2(a ) ) . we note that this kind of analytical expression must be considered carefully in the present case .",
    "indeed , such an expression considers the effect of incoherence on light propagation only and does not consider the incoherent response of the permittivities of the materials , contrary to our present approach using convolution ( see appendix [ formalism ] ) . in spite of that ,",

    "2(a ) ) are quite similar , which validates our method ( in our method , the incoherence limit is approached by taking @xmath64 fs ) .",

    "the results obtained with the convolution formula are presented in fig .",

    "some small discrepancies are observed , which are due to the fact that we did not use the same numerical method ( rcwa vs fdtd ) .",
    "however , our results give the same trends as the results obtained by w. lee _",
    "et al_. it is therefore possible to account for the light incoherence with a simple method , which does not require long computational times contrary to other previously reported methods .",
    "coming back to fig .",
    "2 , the absorption spectra of a three - dimensional corrugated @xmath51 nm - thick c - si slab were calculated using the same method as for the planar slab .",
    "the corrugation follows a super - gaussian profile such as the one defined in @xcite ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the period of the corrugation is @xmath51 nm and its height is @xmath69 nm . the absorption spectra according to various coherence times are shown in fig .",
    "we notice that the value of the coherence time affects the absorption spectrum . the highest coherence time ( here @xmath59 fs ) leads to the strongest oscillations in the spectrum .",
