    "the purpose of this paper is to provide the mathematical analysis , and proposed explanation , for a remarkable experimental observation of seiner _",
    "et al _ on a single crystal of cualni ; see @xcite for details on the experimental procedure , observations and mathematical results .    in the experiment ,",
    "the specimen was a parallelepiped of dimensions 12@xmath03@xmath03mm@xmath1 in its high temperature phase , the austenite , with edges approximately along the cubic axes @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ( see @xcite for a detailed description ) . by applying a uniaxial compression along its longest edge",
    ", the specimen was transformed into a single variant of its low temperature phase , the martensite . however , due to an effect known as mechanical stabilization of martensite , the critical temperature for the transition back to austenite was significantly increased and the reverse transition did not occur during unloading .",
    "the specimen was then locally heated by touching its surface with a heated iron tip with temperature electronically controlled at 200@xmath5c ( control accuracy @xmath6c ) .",
    "we note that the temperature @xmath7 required for the transition back to austenite by homogeneous heating was approximately 60@xmath5c , i.e.  significantly lower than the temperature of the iron tip .",
    "the localized heating was applied in three different ways : ( i ) with the tip touching one of the corners surrounding the upper face ; ( ii ) with the tip touching one of the edges , approximately in the middle between two corners ; ( iii ) with the tip touching approximately at the centre of the upper face .",
    "these experiments were repeated with various faces chosen to be the upper ( observed ) ones .",
    "when heating was applied at a corner , the nucleation was always induced exactly at that corner and occurred nearly immediately after touching the specimen with the tip . when heating was applied either on an edge or at the centre of the upper face , the nucleation occurred at one of the corners as well , i.e.  the localized heating did not result in formation of the nucleus under the tip .",
    "moreover , the nucleus was only observable after 30 - 60 s , which was enough time for the corner to reach the increased critical temperature by thermal conduction . in different tests",
    "the nuclei were observed at different corners . after the nucleation , the transition front formed and propagated through the specimen .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3_hs ] , snapshots from the observations are seen .",
    "the transition fronts have morphologies of the interfacial microstructures described in @xcite ( @xmath8- and @xmath9-interfaces ) , in which the mechanically stabilized martensite is separated from austenite by a twinned region ensuring kinematical compatibility .",
    "it is only natural to treat this problem as one concerning local minimizers , and using a simplified nonlinear elasticity model we propose an explanation for the location of the nucleation points based on ideas of the modern calculus of variations . to be more specific",
    ", it is shown that the free - energy density of our simplified model must be quasiconvex in the interior , as well as quasiconvex at faces and edges of any suitably oriented convex polyhedral domain , seiner s specimen belonging to this class of domains . in this analysis",
    "we assume that the initial state is a pure variant of martensite , as in seiner s experiment .",
    "for some comments on the general case of nucleation of austenite from a microstructure of martensite see section [ sec:4.2 ] .    the problem is expressed in terms of young measures , and our quasiconvexity conditions in the interior and at faces are classical in the sense that they amount to the quasiconvexity condition of morrey  @xcite and the quasiconvexity at the boundary condition of ball & marsden  @xcite expressed in terms of young measures . as for quasiconvexity at edges and corners , that is at the non - smooth parts of the boundary , these conditions can be defined analogously to quasiconvexity at the boundary .",
    "the quasiconvexity conditions for the stabilized variant in the interior , faces and edges imply that the stabilized variant is a minimizer of the energy with respect to localized variations in the interior , faces and edges respectively and nucleation of austenite can not occur there . as for the corners",
    ", an explicit construction shows that , for the crystallographic directions of seiner s specimen and at some corners , a specific microstructure containing austenite can lower the energy .    the paper is structured as follows : though in a simplified setting , our quasiconvexity - based approach is largely inspired by the remarkable work of grabovsky & mengesha  @xcite on sufficient conditions for strong local minimizers , where an answer to the conjecture in  @xcite on quasiconvexity - based sufficient conditions is given . in section  [ sec:1 ]",
    ", we recall the classical definitions of quasiconvexity and briefly review the results in  @xcite . further remarks on possible connections with our work and  @xcite are made in the concluding section of this paper .",
    "we also give a brief account of gradient young measures along with standard results used in the paper and we present the general nonlinear elasticity model used to analyze microstructure formation .    in section  [ sec:1a ] , we take a small detour into the invertibility of sobolev mappings and the interpenetration of matter . in particular , in our model , we will require invertibility for the maps underlying our admissible measures , as well as a certain regularity for the inverse map .",
    "this is achieved by employing the condition of ciarlet & neas  @xcite and exploiting the theory of mappings with bounded distortion , all of which are introduced in this section along with auxiliary results used in the subsequent analysis .",
    "our simplified elasticity model is introduced in section  [ sec:2 ] , where @xmath10-convergence is employed in order to derive an appropriate energy functional and the set of admissible gradient young measures for the problem is introduced .",
    "section  [ sec:3 ] is devoted to the proof of our main result , theorem  [ theorem : main ] , on the location of the nucleation points ; our set of quasiconvexity conditions is also introduced and auxiliary results are established .",
    "quasiconvexity at faces and edges is naturally dependent on the orientation of the convex polyhedral domain , i.e.  the direction of edges and face normals .",
    "the defining property of these directions is independent of the change of symmetry of the crystal lattice from austenite to martensite , but the directions themselves are dependent on the transformation ; as such , for our main result to become applicable to seiner s specimen these directions need to be identified for the cubic - to - orthorhombic transition of cualni",

    "the necessity of condition ( iii ) is due to meyers  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) and can be thought of as a multi - dimensional version of the weierstrass positivity condition ; in fact , it reduces to it when @xmath32 .",

    "@xmath48 , in their seminal paper  @xcite , grabovsky and mengesha showed that a slightly strengthened version of the above set of necessary conditions is in fact sufficient for @xmath58 to be a strong local minimizer of @xmath19 ; see also grabovsky & mengesha  @xcite and grabovsky  @xcite for investigations on the problems of sufficient conditions for @xmath82 weak@xmath83 local minimizers and necessary conditions for @xmath82 strong local minimizers , respectively .",
    "grabovsky and mengesha base their sufficiency proof on a decomposition lemma ( see also @xcite ) which splits arbitrary variations of the dependent variable into a strong and a weak part .",
    "the core of their proof lies in showing that these two parts act on the functional independently .",
    "in particular , they show that the action of the weak part can be described in terms of the second variation , whereas , the action of the strong part is ` localized ' , in the sense that it can be described as a superposition of ` weierstrass needles ' . then , it is the ( uniform ) positivity of the second variation and the ( uniform ) quasiconvexity conditions , respectively , that prevent the weak and the strong part from decreasing the functional .",
    "although it may be possible to extend the work in  @xcite to domains with edges and corners , it is formulated for smooth domains and everywhere defined and continuous @xmath29 , and is not directly applicable to our case .",
    "however in this paper we restrict attention to localized variations only , corresponding to localized nucleation , and so it is the quasiconvexity conditions in the interior and at faces and edges of the parallelepiped domain which will be seen to prevent these localized variations from lowering the energy .",

    "a classical result concerning young measures ( e.g.  @xcite ) is that , for every sequence @xmath99 uniformly bounded in @xmath100 , @xmath101 , there exists a subsequence ( not relabelled ) and a young measure @xmath97 such that , for all continuous functions @xmath36 satisfying @xmath102 with @xmath103 , @xmath104 in particular , since @xmath105 is bounded in @xmath100 , @xmath106 note that for @xmath107 , ( [ eq : ymlimit ] ) holds weak@xmath83 in @xmath108 and for all continuous @xmath36 ; similarly for ( [ eq : ymlimitfns ] ) .",

    "therefore , one can cover any nucleation region @xmath694 on a face or @xmath695 at an edge and our main result applies .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the set of maximal directions - as calculated in lemma  [ lemmamaximalusinverse ] , say for @xmath960 , ( similarly for the rest ) - is the interior of the set @xmath1165 where strict inequalities have been replaced with inequalities . in particular , we note that the above set contains the vector @xmath1099 .",
    "then , defining the set @xmath1166 it is possible to use a continuity argument and deduce the quasiconvexity conditions at any face with normal perpendicular to , or any edge in the direction of , a vector in @xmath1167 .",
    "however , we have not been able to show that the set @xmath440 is the interior of @xmath1168 for a general transformation and without stringent assumptions on the lattice parameters .",
    "also , we note that for any @xmath945 and appropriate lattice parameters , the set @xmath944 contains several sets of three linearly independent directions and our methods apply to a variety of parallelepipeds with edges along these directions .",
    "however , for these lattice parameters , @xmath944 does not exhaust the unit sphere .",
    "hence our result leaves open the possibility that for differently cut specimens nucleation could occur at a face or an edge .",
    "we stress that our analysis carries through even if we depart from the exact form of the energy wells of the cubic - to - orthorhombic transition .",
    "this exact form of the set @xmath287 is only relevant for the calculation of the maximal directions and the remainder of our analysis remains applicable for any number of martensitic variants and any transformation with cubic austenite .",
    "in fact , for our analysis to apply we need only require that @xmath1169 is such that the variants @xmath275 are symmetry related and satisfy the constraint on the determinant and the largest eigenvalue of the cofactor matrix .",
    "of course , this is not necessarily the case for the construction at a corner .",
    "we note that the argument of maximal directions reduces to measuring the length of lines ; having fixed the endpoints of the deformed segments , the definition of a maximal direction ensures that its length can not be greater than the length of the straight line joining the endpoints and , thus , it must precisely be that straight line .",
    "similar ideas are also used in sivaloganathan & spector   to show that for an incompressible cylinder under uniaxial extension , the unique minimizer is a homogeneous , isoaxial deformation ( under additional constitutive hypotheses on the stored - energy function ) .",
    "note that it is also possible to use a similar method based on the cofactor matrix and areas of surfaces rather than lengths .",
    "we mention , however , that such a method allows one to deduce the quasiconvexity condition on faces with normals in @xmath440 and does not seem applicable to edges . in particular , since @xmath1170 , we would add no new faces .    also , as we alluded to in the introduction , there are connections between our work and that of grabovsky & mengesha  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we mentioned that grabovsky and mengesha base their sufficiency proof on a decomposition lemma splitting arbitrary variations into a strong and a weak part which can not lower the energy due to the ( uniform ) positivity of the second variation and the ( uniform ) quasiconvexity conditions , respectively . in our analysis , we have restricted attention to localized variations corresponding to the localized nucleation of austenite .",
    "nevertheless , if we depart from our simplified setting of the singular energy , one expects to be able to prove something stronger using the machinery of grabovsky and mengesha ; in particular , one might be able to show that whenever @xmath118 is a @xmath82 gradient young measure such that @xmath1171 is sufficiently small and @xmath1172 , then @xmath118 must necessarily involve nucleation at a corner .",
    "here , the distance @xmath1173 , given by ( [ eq : ymdistance ] ) , comes from the metrization of the weak@xmath83 topology in @xmath1174 .",
    "this is a direction worth investigating further .    concluding our final remarks , we mention that the same nucleation mechanism at a corner was also observed by seiner for a cualni specimen which was mechanically stabilized as a compound twin .",
    "we recall that , for typical lattice parameters , compound twins are also unable to form directly compatible interfaces with austenite so that the mechanical stabilization effect comes into play .",
    "we note that our methods , presented in this chapter , may be applicable to this case as well .",
    "nucleation at a corner also occurs for a homogeneously heated specimen consisting of a pure variant of martensite , but at a temperature significantly higher than for a corresponding specimen consisting of thermally induced martensite . idealizing the latter by a simple laminate of martensite that is compatible with the austenite",
    ", one can intuitively understand this difference of temperatures .",
    "for the thermally induced martensite , nucleating a volume @xmath240 of austenite at a corner reduces the energy by @xmath1175 together with another term proportional to @xmath240 representing the energy of the twin interfaces in the laminate that are no longer present in the austenite . however , nucleating the same volume @xmath240 from a single variant using the construction in lemma  [ prop : corner ] again reduces the energy by @xmath1175 , but there is an _ increase _ of energy required for the formation of the twin interfaces in the laminate interpolating between the austenite and the single variant . thus it is energetically easier to nucleate the austenite in the thermally induced case .",
    "of course the model considered in this paper ignores such interfacial energy contributions , and it would be interesting to be able to include them .    incorporating interfacial energy would , however , give rise to some nontrivial issues .",
    "for example , it is shown in ball & crooks @xcite that in a second gradient model of interfacial energy the austenite lies in a ( shallow ) potential well in @xmath1176 , rather than being unstable to the nucleation of an austenite - martensite interface as in our model .",
    "another natural question concerns how our results are affected by a slight smoothing of the edges and corners of the specimen .",
    "a natural conjecture would be that the pure variant of martensite might then be stable , lying in a shallow potential well as in the case of small interfacial energy just described , rather than being unstable to nucleation of austenite at a corner as in our model .",
    "lastly , similar situations in which the incompatibility of gradients results in hysteresis are documented in other contexts , e.g.  ball & james  @xcite or ball , chu & james  @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "though in a different way , the mathematical analysis argues that despite the existence of a state with lower energy than a certain martensitic variant , it is necessarily geometrically incompatible with it , giving rise to an energy barrier which keeps the specific martensitic variant stable .",

    "<S> the result for the interior , faces and edges is established by showing that the free - energy function satisfies a set of quasiconvexity conditions at the stabilized variant in the interior , faces and edges , respectively , provided the specimen is suitably cut .     </S>",
