    "most of these are binary or ternary metallic alloys ( but never a pure metal ) .",
    "the quest to find quasicrystals beyond alloys has led to an increasing number of examples , mostly in the field of soft condensed matter.@xcite examples include dendrimers,@xcite star polymers,@xcite micelles@xcite and binary mixtures of nanoparticles.@xcite all of these examples , except for one of the micellar systems,@xcite have dodecagonal symmetry and are often found in regions of parameter space close to where crystalline approximants , such as the frank - kasper @xmath1 phase , are observed.@xcite    a remaining target is to find a colloidal system that can self - assemble into a quasicrystalline structure in the absence of an external field ( two - dimensional colloidal quasicrystals can be induced to form using quasiperiodic light fields@xcite ) .",
    "one approach might be to use a binary or ternary colloidal mixture , but although complex crystal structures have been reported for binary mixtures,@xcite as yet no quasicrystals have been observed .",
    "another approach might be to use colloids with anisotropic `` patchy '' interactions,@xcite where the positions of the patches could be used to control the preferred local geometry and hence influence the global structure formed .",
    "indeed , much progress has been made in developing methods to synthesize such types of colloidal particles.@xcite furthermore , the first experiments on the novel structures that such patchy interactions can enable the systems to adopt are beginning to appear,@xcite as well as being systematically explored through computer simulations.@xcite    quasicrystals have also been found to form for a variety of model potentials in computer simulations .",
    "interestingly , these are not restricted to mixtures,@xcite but can also occur for one - component systems.@xcite examples include isotropic pair potentials with both a maximum and a minimum in the potential,@xcite micellar models,@xcite hard tetrahedra@xcite and triangular bipyramids,@xcite and water@xcite and silicon@xcite bilayers .    here",
    ", we wish to examine in detail the behaviour of two - dimensional patchy particles with 5 and 7 patches as possible quasicrystal - forming systems .",
    "the reason we choose this system is that in a recent study of two - dimensional disks with regularly arranged patches , intriguing behaviour was seen for the 5-patch system.@xcite hard disks naturally form a hexagonal crystal , and six patches reinforce this tendency . for four patches ,",
    "there is a competition between a square crystal , which is energetically stabilized by the patchy interactions , and a hexagonal crystal , which is stabilized by its higher density .",
    "however , the situation for particles with 5 regularly arranged patches is more complex , since the 5-fold symmetry of the particles is incompatible with crystalline order  there is no crystal in which all the patches can point directly at those on neighbouring particles .    in ref .",
    "we found that on cooling ( at low pressure ) , crystallization was not observed , because of the frustration introduced by the geometry of the patches .",
    "the configurations generated did though show certain common local motifs ( those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : local ] ) and could be considered as tilings of squares and triangles .",
    "although there was no overall crystalline order , there was some evidence suggestive of longer - range orientational order ; however , because of the relatively small systems sizes considered this was not pursued further at the time .",
    "given the known tendency of random square - triangle tilings to form dodecagonal quasicrystals,@xcite we now investigate in detail the suggestion made in ref .",

    "the model consists of spherical particles patterned with attractive patches .",
    "they are described by a modified lennard - jones potential , in which the repulsive part of the potential is isotropic , but the attractive part is anisotropic and depends on the alignment of patches on interacting particles .",
    "specifically , the potential is described by @xmath2 where @xmath3 , the lennard - jones potential , is given by @xmath4.\\ ] ] the minimum of this potential is at @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is an angular modulation factor that depends on the orientations of the patches on the two interacting particles with respect to the interparticle vector .",
    "specifically , @xmath7 where @xmath8 @xmath9 is a measure of the angular width of the patches , @xmath10 is the angle between patch vector @xmath11 on particle @xmath12 and the interparticle vector @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the patch that minimizes the magnitude of this angle .",
    "hence , only the patches on each particle that are closest to the interparticle vector interact with each other , and @xmath15 if the patches point directly at each other .",
    "one feature of this potential is that as @xmath16 the isotropic lennard - jones potential is recovered . for computational efficiency",
    "the potential is truncated and shifted at @xmath17 , and the crossover distance in eq .",
    "[ eq : potential ] is adjusted so that it still occurs when the potential is zero .",
    "as well as studying crystalization in two dimensions,@xcite this patchy particle model has also been previously used to study crystallization in three dimensions,@xcite and the self - assembly of monodisperse shells.@xcite      systems of particles were simulated using standard metropolis monte carlo ( mc ) in the npt ensemble .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were applied , and the simulation box was constrained to be square .",
    "the mc moves were single - particle rotational and translational moves , as well as `` volume '' moves in which the area of the box was scaled , the latter allowing a constant pressure ensemble to be simulated .",
    "the number of particles @xmath18 was always 2500 .",
    "we employ a number of approaches to analyse the structures that the systems of patchy particles adopt . in the condensed state , we find that the 5- and 7-patch particles virtually always adopt one of three local environments .",
    "these are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : local ] .",
    "there are two possible five - coordinate environments , which are based upon two different ways of locally packing squares and triangles .",
    "we refer to them as the @xmath1 and @xmath19 environments by analogy to the frank - kasper phases of these names.@xcite these @xmath1 and @xmath19 frank kasper phases are crystalline approximants to dodecagonal quasicrystals and can be considered as square - triangle tilings in two of their three dimensions.@xcite the tilings containing only these local environments are more formally denoted by @xmath20 ( @xmath1 ) and @xmath21 ( @xmath19 ) , where this nomenclature refers to the sequence of polygons around a vertex.@xcite the third local environment is the six - coordinate hexagonal environment , which represents the densest local packing , and will be denoted @xmath22 , again by analogy to a frank - kasper phase .    to identify these environments",
    "we employ a common neighbour analysis .",
    "neighbours are defined as all particles within a certain cutoff radius @xmath23 from a given particle .",
    "then for each pair of neighbours the number of neighbours common to both is determined .",
    "each local environment is characterized by a unique signature in terms of the number of neighbours with which the central particle shares a certain number of neighbours .",
    "for example , a particle in a @xmath1 local environment has a total of five neighbours , with one of which it has two neighbours in common and with four of which it has one neighbour in common .",
    "hence , this environment is denoted by the common neighbour signature \\{21111}. in a similar way , the signatures for the @xmath19 and @xmath22 local environments are \\{22110 } and \\{222222 } , respectively .",
    "particles that are not in any of these three local environments are labelled ` undefined ' ( @xmath24 ) . the cutoff radius ( @xmath25 )",
    "was chosen such that the fraction of @xmath24-particles was minimized .",
    "to probe the global order of the configurations generated , the associated diffraction patterns were calculated .",
    "quasicrystalline configurations are characterized by diffraction patterns with non - crystallographic rotational symmetries .",
    "we calculated the diffraction patterns by evaluating the real part of the interference function : @xmath26,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the wavevector and @xmath28 the position of particle @xmath12 .",
    "unless stated otherwise , the resolution we used for the plots of the diffraction patterns is @xmath29 .    when mapping out the behaviour of our system as a function of the parameter space it will be useful to to measure the degree of twelvefold symmetry of the diffraction pattern . to achieve this , we take a fourier transform around a ring of the interference pattern at a @xmath30 value corresponding to the first diffraction peaks .",
    "specifically , we evaluate @xmath31 where the sum is over the @xmath32 sampled points of @xmath33 .",

    "we will first consider the 5-patch particles in detail .",
    "the behaviour of the 7-patch particles is fairly similar and so we will consider this system more briefly in section [ sect:7patch ] .        the most stable phase at zero temperature is simply that with the lowest enthalpy .",
    "therefore , we minimized the enthalpy for a variety of candidate crystal structures under different conditions and potential parameters in order to obtain figure [ fig : xtals ] , which shows how the lowest enthalpy crystal structure depends on pressure and patch width .",
    "this figure is slightly different from that which appeared in ref .  , because a slightly lower energy crystal at low @xmath9 was subsequently identified in ref .     at sufficiently high pressure",
    "the most stable phase will be the crystal with highest density , which in this system is the hexagonal crystal . at sufficiently low pressure , the crystal structure with the lowest energy will be most stable , and will be the one which maximizes the patch - patch interactions .    at intermediate values of the patch width ,",
    "the low energy crystals are those based on the two five - coordinate local environments depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : local ] . although the patches are not able to point directly at those on neighbouring particles in these motifs , the loss in energy is not prohibitive because the angular deviations are relatively small ( fig .",

    "the average angular deviation is smaller in the @xmath1 local environment , the @xmath1 crystal is slightly lower in energy than the @xmath19 crystal .    as the patches becomes narrower , the energetic penalty associated with the non - perfect alignment of the patches with the interparticle vectors increases , until a point is reached where it becomes favourable for the local environments to distort so that the patches point directly at three of the five neighbours .",

    "the resulting crystals are virtually degenerate , with the distorted @xmath1 structure just lower in energy.@xcite    as the patch width is increased away from the intermediate values at which the @xmath1 phase is stable , the orientational dependence of the potential becomes weaker , and there comes a point at which the hexagonal crystal becomes lowest in energy because of its greater number of neighbours .    in the @xmath1-phase",
    "the ratio of triangles to squares is 2 .",
    "there are also many larger - unit cell crystal structures with a mixture of @xmath1 and @xmath22 environments that have an increasing ratio of triangles to squares .",
    "we thought that these more complex crystals might be most stable near to the @xmath1/hexagonal boundary in fig .",

    "( c ) at low values of the patch width it is favourable for these structures to distort so that three of the patches point directly at the neighbouring particles .",
    "the resulting structures can be viewed as being made up of the depicted hexagon . ,",

    "however , it may be that a quasicrystal is more kinetically accessible than possible crystals on cooling , or is even thermodynamically stable for a particular temperature range due to its greater entropy .",

    "close inspection of the configuration shows that the hexagonal atoms for the most part do not cluster together but are instead isolated from each other and are usually at the centre of the dodecagonal motifs depicted in fig .   [ fig : dodecagon_motifs](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "these dodecagonal motifs can join together in two ways .",

    "[ fig : local ] , but now , of course , on a longer length scale .",
    "furthermore , this tiling seems to be random and does not completely tile the plane , because of a significant fraction of defects , both in terms of @xmath24 particles with an `` unidentified '' coordination shell and strings of @xmath19 particles .",
    "it is noteworthy that @xmath1 and @xmath19 crystals can form a coherent interface along the \\{11 } directions of the @xmath1 crystals , and the latter defects seem to often occur when the @xmath1-like order in two adjacent regions is not fully in registry , and needs a line of @xmath19 atoms to bridge the regions .",
    "another source of disorder is the two possible orientations of the central hexagon in the dodecagonal motif , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dodecagon_motifs](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the two forms can be transformed into each other by a rotation of the hexagon by @xmath50 .",
    "for the edge - sharing dodecagons in fig .",
    "[ fig : dodecagon_motifs ] the orientations of the hexagons have been chosen so that all the particles on the edge of the dodecagons have the more favourable @xmath1 environments .",
    "however , some relative orientations of the internal hexagons lead to @xmath19 environments . for example , there are two @xmath19 environments at the shared edge if both hexagons have bonds parallel to the shared edge , and a few examples of such @xmath19 `` dimers '' can be found in fig .",
    "[ fig:5patch_qc](a ) .",
    "by contrast , for the interpenetrating dodecagons ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dodecagon_motifs](d ) and ( e ) ) , if the hexagon at the centre of one of the dodecagons is rotated , the dodecagonal character of the other centres is lost , although the packing is still a square - triangle tiling .",
    "another way to characterize the structures that we observe is in terms of the ratio of triangles to squares in the tiling , and the related ratio of the number of five- and six - coordinate atoms .",
    "for example , we find the ratio of triangles to squares for the configuration in fig .",
    "[ fig:5patch_qc](a ) to be 2.303 , which compares with a value of 2 for the @xmath1 crystal and @xmath51 for an `` extended schlottmann '' quasicrystal.@xcite similarly , the ratio of 5- to 6-coordinate environments is 13.194 for the configuration in fig .",
    "[ fig:5patch_qc](a ) , which is again similar to the value for an `` extended schlottmann '' quasicrystal , namely @xmath52 .",
    "these results clearly indicate the close similarity of the structures we obtain to ideal dodecagonal quasicrystals .",
    "so far we have only looked at the structure that results for one particular set of conditions .",
    "figure [ fig:5patch_map ] provides an overview of the structural behaviour as a function of pressure and patch width , and figure [ fig:5patch_configs ] provides example final configurations for different patch widths at a representative pressure .    in the top right corner of the ( @xmath9,@xmath53 ) plane ,",
    "i.e.  larger patch widths and higher pressures , the hexagonal phase is most stable ( figure [ fig : xtals ] ) . as one moves away from this corner of the parameter space to lower pressures and patch widths ,",
    "the onset of quasicrystal formation is signalled by a sharp increase in the number of @xmath1 environments at the expense of hexagonal environments ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5patch_map](a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "close to this boundary , our measure of the twelvefoldness of the diffraction pattern generally has high values , although this measure should be interpreted with caution as false positives can arise .",
    "for example , the superposition of diffraction patterns from two different hexagonal domains leads to an anomalously high value of the twelvefoldness at @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the position of the hexagonal to quasicrystal boundary in fig .",
    "[ fig:5patch_map ] is noticeably to the left of the zero - temperature @xmath1-hexagonal boundary in fig .",
    "[ fig : xtals ] because of the entropic stabilization of the hexagonal phase mentioned earlier .",
    "as one moves away from this boundary , the number of hexagonal atoms slowly decreases towards zero and the degree of twelvefoldness generally drops . examining the configurations in fig .",
    "[ fig:5patch_configs ] one sees a gradual crossover from the quasicrystalline configurations with hexagonal atoms at the centre of the characteristic dodecagons to a pure @xmath1 phase in fig .",

    "this crossover is driven by the hexagonal environments becoming energetically increasingly unfavourable as the patches become narrower .    at the narrowest patch width we considered ,",

    "the question is then how do the particles manage to maximize their patch - patch interactions ?",
    "when the patches are reasonably narrow , the solution the system finds is to use only five of the seven patches , and to adopt the same types of square - triangle tilings as for the 5-patch system .",
    "figure [ fig:7_angles ] shows the arrangement of the particles in the @xmath1 and @xmath19 environments , and it can be again seen that the @xmath1 environment has a smaller average deviation of the patch vectors from the interparticle vectors .",
    "because of this tendency to form square - triangle tilings , the behaviour of the 7-patch system is very similar to the 5-patch system , and so we will much more briefly review the behaviour of this system .",
    "the zero temperature phase diagram shows a very similar form with a hexagonal crystal having lowest enthalpy at high pressure and patch width , and a @xmath1 crystal at lower pressures and patch widths .",
    "the crossover between these forms occurs at slightly narrower patch widths than for the 5-patch system , because the 7 patches makes the potential somewhat closer to the isotropic limit . as for the 5-patch system at very narrow patch widths",
    ", this structure distorts so that three of the seven patches point directly at their neighbours , but this time the acute angle in the hexagonal units is @xmath56 not @xmath57 .",

    "[ fig : dodecagon_motifs ] ) as found for the 5-patch system .",
    "here we have presented results for a simple two - dimensional patchy particle system that exhibits a rich ordering behaviour , in particular showing the formation of dodecagonal quasicrystals based on square - triangle tilings for certain parameter ranges for particles with five and seven regularly arranged patches .",
    "these examples can be added to the increasing list of model systems that have been shown to form quasicrystals in simulations .",
    "@xcite the system also provides a nice model system that illustrates how the local structural propensities can lead to complex globally - ordered structures .",
    "in particular , quasicrystals were observed in the region of parameter space near to where the enthalpically preferred structure changes from five - fold to six - fold coordination , because of the presence of both coordination environments in the quasicrystal .",
    "interestingly , the structure of the quasicrystals is quite similar to model square - triangle dodecagonal quasicrystals produced by inflation rules.@xcite    one interesting question concerning the quasicrystals that we observe is whether they are thermodynamically stable or just a kinetic product .",
    "as the enthalpy difference between the quasicrystal and the crystal is not that large , it is not unreasonable that the quasicrystal could become thermodynamically stable due to the entropy associated with the many possible configurations for the quasicrystal .",
    "however , to confirm this hypothesis would require the free energy of the quasicrystal ( or the free energy difference between it and the crystal ) to be computed , but it is not clear how this could be achieved . during some of the cooling simulations , the system passes from a liquid to a hexagonal crystal and then to a quasicrystal as the temperature is decreased , showing that there is a parameter range where the quasicrystal is more stable than the hexagonal crystal .",
    "however , on heating the @xmath1 crystal , we have never seen it transform into a quasicrystal , but instead it directly melts .",
    "an interesting contrast to the behaviour we see here is provided by particles that have five - fold symmetry in their repulsive interactions,@xcite rather than their attractions .",
    "although hard pentagons show an interesting set of solid phases structures,@xcite none of them are quasicrystalline .",
    "another important question is whether a system that shows behaviour similar to our model could be experimentally realized .",
    "methods to synthesize patchy colloids and nanoparticles are developing rapidly , but as far as we are aware , there are none yet available that could produce , say , particles with a five - fold symmetric distribution of patches .",
    "by contrast , effectively restricting such colloidal systems to two - dimensions would be relatively straightforward .",
    "for example , if there is a density mismatch between the colloids and the solvent , sedimentation can lead to monolayer formation at the base of the sample , as has been done in recent experiments where a two - dimensional kagome lattice was assembled from ` triblock janus ' particles.@xcite    another possible system in which these dodecagonal quasicrystals could be potentially realized is the multi - arm dna motifs produced by the group of chengde mao.@xcite each arm is made of two - parallel double helices and both have dangling single - stranded ends that allow them to bind to other such motifs with a well - defined relative orientation .",
    "these effective torsional constraints on the interactions lead to quasi - two - dimensional growth be it into sheets@xcite or closed shells.@xcite interestingly , similar to the equivalent patchy particles , the 3- , 4- and 6-arm motifs form two - dimensional honeycomb,@xcite square@xcite and hexagonal@xcite lattices .",
    "furthermore , the five - arm motifs can form a @xmath1-phase like lattice.@xcite    however , there are also a number of significant differences between the dna multi - arm motifs and patchy particle systems .",
    "firstly , the central loop to which the stiff double helices are connected has a certain degree of flexibility allowing the relative angles of the arms to vary .",
    "by contrast , the positions of the patches in our model are fixed .",
    "secondly , the `` valence '' of the dna motifs is fixed ; i.e.  the five - arm motifs can only ever bond to five other such motifs . by contrast , for our patchy particles at intermediate values of the patch width , the particles can adopt five - fold or six - fold coordination environments ; it is this flexibility that allows the system to form the quasicrystals .",
    "therefore , if the dna motifs are to be able to form a quasicrystal , a mixture of 5- and 6-arm motifs with the right stoichiometry would be required .",
    "for an ideal dodecagonal quasicrystal , the required ratio of 5- and 6-arm tiles would be @xmath58 .",
    "however , even with such a mixture , it might be that the system prefers to phase separate into @xmath1 and hexagonal crystals , similar to what has been seen for mixtures of 3- and 4-arm tiles.@xcite    in future work , we tend to explore this possibility further , first by using a coarse - grained model of dna that we have recently developed@xcite to characterize these dna multi - arm motifs , including their flexibility and the angular specificity of their interactions . secondly , this information will then be used to create a patchy - particle representation , where the patch positions are not rigidly fixed but are constrained by an internal potential .",
