    "in the past few years there has been an increasing interest among theoretical physicists in complex phenomena occurring in fields that are far apart from the traditional realm of physics like social and economic sciences @xcite .",
    "the main reason being that social and economic systems often exhibit many instances of complex dynamics , including self - organization , pattern formation , synchronization and phase transition - like phenomena that closely resemble those observed in nonequilibrium physical systems @xcite .",
    "physicists approach to these systems usually provides insights into the basic ingredients that should be included in simple models in order to obtain the dynamics observed .",
    "although it is clear that physics inspired models of socioeconomic phenomena are often very simplistic views of very complicated systems , the aim is to show how complex macroscopic dynamics might arise from rather simple rules operating at the microscopic level of individual agents and their mutual interactions .    in this paper",
    "we consider a very simple model of innovation propagation dynamics in an economic system formed by agents @xcite .",
    "the aim is to describe in a simple way the adoption of innovations that occurs among industries , firms or individuals .",
    "once a brand new product appears in the market , the agents should decide whether or not they will incorporate the new technology . adopting the new technology ( in the form of a software , device , gadget , etc ) has a cost , but at the same time it may improve business performance in the case of firms , or may level off life quality for individuals .",
    "innovations are regarded here in a broad sense and stand for any device or tool .",
    "for instance , a firm can decide to incorporate www technology by creating or revamping its www page , or going into e - commerce for the first time .",
    "a layman observation is that , if not always , in most cases , when the new technology actually improves performance its use will spread all over .    in this approach",
    "two main mechanisms for the propagation of innovations are considered .",
    "firstly , external pressure can push an agent to adopt an innovation .",
    "this mechanism intends to mimic exogenous influence , such as advertising , and is independent of the network structure .",
    "secondly , there is the interaction among agents , which depends on the underlying network structure and is introduced in the model by considering local coupling rules .",
    "a single tunable parameter @xmath0 , which is fixed and the same for all agents , accounts for the agents resistance to change and controls the dynamical behavior of the system . in earlier studies ,",
    "some of us have already focused on the several outcomes of the model in the social and economic context @xcite . from the economic point of view , the main result is that the system presents an optimal behavior for an intermediate value of @xmath0 , and that this can be quantified with a macroscopic observable .",
    "this feature is closely related with the statistical properties of the profile of technological levels of the agents and its dynamical evolution .",
    "a proper characterization of these properties can be done with the tools of statistical mechanics and it is the main aim of this work .    in this paper we show that this model can be interpreted as a surface growth model .",
    "such interpretation allows us to analyze the dynamical behavior of the model as a kinetic roughening process akin to other nonequilibrium surface growth systems .",
    "we find that the model exhibits a continuous phase transition between a rough and a flat phase at a critical value @xmath1 of the control parameter .",
    "we focus on the scaling properties at the threshold in order to determine the critical exponents at the transition . by defining a convenient order parameter and studying its finite - size scaling properties near criticality we are able to show that the horizontal correlation length diverges as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 .",
    "close to the threshold , relaxation dynamics to the stationary regime is characterized by diverging correlation times @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the dynamic exponent .",
    "the existence of a nonequilibrium roughening transition in a 1 + 1 dimension model makes it interesting also for statistical mechanics .",
    "it is known that phase transitions in nonequilibrium @xmath6 dimensional systems are usually associated with systems with absorbing states @xcite . in this case , the number of absorbing states and symmetries among them determine the universality class to which a particular system belongs to .",
    "thus , it is of great interest to find models far from equilibrium which do not possess absorbing states but still display a phase transition . as we will see below",
    ", our model lacks absorbing states and the measured critical exponents suggest that this model belongs to a new universality class .",
    "finally , we discuss the physical mechanisms behind the critical transition in this model .",
    "we consider @xmath7 agents placed at the sites of a one - dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions . each site ( agent )",
    "@xmath8 is characterized by a real variable @xmath9 . in general",
    ", we can consider this quantity as a _",
    "characteristic _ of a given individual that other agents might want to imitate .",
    "when an agent has adopted a new feature ( innovation ) , her neighbors become aware of the change and balance their interest ( quantified as @xmath10 ) with their resistance to change @xmath0 to decide if they would like to imitate this change . in this way",
    "@xmath0 controls the mechanism of imitation .",
    "this parameter is constant and the same for all the agents in the system .",
    "the system is updated as follows @xcite :    1 .   at each time step",
    "an agent @xmath9 is randomly selected and @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a random variable uniformly distributed in @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "the driving process accounts for the external pressure that may lead an individual to spontaneously update by adopting a new technology .",
    "this mechanism keeps the system out of equilibrium .",
    "2 .   the agents @xmath14 ,",
    "being @xmath15 the set of nearest - neighbours of agent @xmath8 , upgrade if @xmath16 .",
    "if the latter is satisfied , agent @xmath17 imitates agent @xmath8 by setting @xmath18 . in this way the information of an update may spread beyond the neighbors of the originally perturbed site .",
    "this procedure is repeated until no one else wants to change , concluding an _ avalanche _ of imitation events .",
    "we thus assume that the time scale of the imitation process is much shorter than the one corresponding to the external driving .",
    "= 7.0 cm = 5.0 cm    starting from a flat initial condition , @xmath19 for all @xmath8 , the system evolves to a stationary regime . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we present snapshots of the surface profile in the stationary regime for four different values of @xmath0 .",
    "the time scale separation namely , slow driving versus fast relaxation in the form of avalanches of activity is similar to that occurring in self - organized critical ( soc ) systems and dynamically drives the system towards a stationary state @xcite .",
    "we will see below that , at variance with most soc systems , two different stable phases are possible : an ordered ( flat ) phase and a disordered ( rough ) phase with scale invariant properties . for small @xmath0",
    ", the driving process easily triggers avalanches that cover the whole system , leading to a uniform advance and a flat phase . on the contrary , for large @xmath0 , there are almost no avalanches , and the system advances mostly due to the random updates , thus presenting an extremely heterogeneous and rough profile . for intermediate values of c one can clearly see the presence of large avalanches and new updates .",
    "in fact , in the intermediate regime one can find the optimal growth regime in which the agents reach a given average level with a minimum number of upgrades @xcite .",
    "in order to characterize the different morphological phases we have performed extensive numerical simulations of the model .",
    "the fluctuations of the profile height are measured by means of the global interface width @xcite , @xmath20 ^ 2 } \\ ; \\right\\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath21 stands for average over noise realizations . at each time",
    "step the mean height value @xmath22 is also calculated .",
    "it is important to stress here that time is always measured in the external driving temporal scale , so that one time step @xmath23 corresponds to an external update . as a consequence , the number of agents that change their state may vary from a single one ( which changes from @xmath24 to @xmath25 ) to any number of agents in the system if the update generates an avalanche .    in the following we report on the behavior of the width in the two different phases . on the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the behavior of @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "the saturation value does not depend on the system size , which indicates that the system is in the smooth phase . on the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the numerical results in the rough phase , for @xmath28 . in this case",
    "the saturation value @xmath29 scales with the system size , as is shown in the inset .",
    "we find that in the rough phase the height fluctuations seem to fit reasonable well with a scaling as @xmath30 , which actually can not be distinguished from a possibly logarithmic dependence .",
    "these results strongly suggest the presence of a roughening transition .",
    "= 7.0 cm = 4.5 cm = 7.0 cm = 4.5 cm    in order to study the critical behavior at the transition threshold we introduce a convenient order parameter . when looking at the profile snapshots in the stationary regime in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , one can easily notice the presence of large plateaux , _",
    "i.e. _ finite connected regions of agents that have the same height .",
    "the size of these flat regions decreases as @xmath0 grows , since for @xmath31 the model has to become equivalent to the random deposition model @xcite .",
    "we found that the size of the largest plateau can be used as an order parameter . in the following ,",
    "we shall call @xmath32 to the size of the largest plateau in the system , normalized by the system size @xmath7 . in this way",
    ", a completely flat profile corresponds to @xmath33 .",
    "we have also tried other common choices , as the often used ising - like magnetization ( 1/n)@xmath34 and its variations @xcite .",
    "however , we found that our election has better scaling properties for this particular case , since it takes into account the singular behavior of the flat phase in this model .",
    "= 7.0 cm = 5.0 cm    starting from a flat initial condition @xmath35 evolves until it reaches a stationary value . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the behavior of the stationary value of the order parameter @xmath36 vs. @xmath0 for four different system sizes .",
    "the order parameter allows us to distinguish the two phases discussed above .",
    "note that for small values of the control parameter , the system gets ordered , implying a flat phase . on the contrary",
    ", the stationary value of the order parameter goes to zero for large values of @xmath0 as the system size becomes larger .",
    "critical behavior is expected close to the threshold @xmath1 and , as usual , it can be studied numerically by finite - size scaling techniques @xcite as follows . for any value of the control parameter @xmath0 , there exists a horizontal correlation length @xmath37 , which diverges as @xmath38 when the distance to the critical threshold goes to zero @xmath39 . in finite systems",
    "this actually occurs for values of @xmath0 close to , but not exactly at , the threshold since the finite - size critical behavior is encountered as long as @xmath40 , or equivalently when @xmath41 .",
    "close to the threshold , @xmath42 , for sufficiently large values of the system size , @xmath43 converges to a finite value obeying @xmath44 .",
    "just at the critical point @xmath45 we expect the order parameter to decay as a power - law with the system size @xmath46 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we plot our numerical results for @xmath47 vs. @xmath7 for different values of the distance to the threshold @xmath48 . only for @xmath49 a power - law with the system size can be obtained and the slope of the straight line in a log - log plot gives an estimation of the ratio @xmath50 between critical exponents .",
    "we can thus identify @xmath51 with the critical point .",
    "after having determined the critical point , numerical data for different system sizes can be cast in the finite - size scaling ansatz @xmath52 where the scaling function @xmath53 for @xmath54 , and @xmath55 if @xmath56 . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we plot a data collapse that allows us to determine the values of the exponents @xmath57 and @xmath58 . from these",
    ", we then have @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "= 7.0 cm = 5.0 cm    = 7.0 cm = 5.0 cm      since the model is out of equilibrium our study is completed next with an analysis of the dynamic behavior , which contains much information about the universality of the roughening transition . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we show the temporal behavior of the order parameter @xmath61 for three different values of @xmath0 ( above , below and at the critical threshold ) .",
    "again , only at the critical point we may expect to find a power - law decay @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the exponent associated with the diverging correlation time @xmath64 as @xmath42 .",
    "the correlation time corresponds to the typical time that correlations survive in the system and is given by @xmath4 , where @xmath65 is the dynamic exponent .",
    "the three exponents are related by the usual scaling relation @xmath66 provided dynamic scaling holds . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we can see that only at the critical point a power - law behavior is observed , while deviations occur for @xmath67 .",
    "the fit to a straight line in a log - log plot , as shown fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , leads to a determination of the ratio @xmath68 .",
    "one can write the dynamic scaling ansatz @xmath69 for the order parameter , which at the critical point , @xmath70 , reads @xmath71 where the scaling function @xmath72 for @xmath73 and @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "we can then use the values of the exponents just obtained to collapse our data as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] with exponents @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "= 7.0 cm = 5.0 cm    = 7.0 cm = 5.0 cm    = 7.0 cm = 5.0 cm    nonequilibrium phase transitions have been mostly related to the universality class of directed percolation ( dp ) , with very few exceptions @xcite .",
    "in particular , there are many examples of roughening transitions far from equilibrium that have been linked to dp , examples include polynuclear growth models @xcite , solid - on - solid models with evaporation at the edges of terraces @xcite and the fungal growth model @xcite . in all these systems ,",
    "the dp process emerges at a particular reference height of the interface . in this case",
    ", the critical exponents characterizing the roughening transition can be obtained from those of dp , which in 1 + 1 dimension are given by @xmath78 for the correlation length exponent , @xmath79 for the time correlation exponent , and @xmath80 the dynamic exponent @xcite .",
    "our results clearly suggest that the roughening transition occurring in the innovation propagation model does not belong to the dp class .",
    "the relation of many nonequilibrium critical models to dp has led to the proposal of the conjecture due to janssen and grassberger @xcite , which states that a model belongs to dp under the following assumptions",
    "@xcite :    1 .",
    "the model displays a continuous phase transition from a fluctuating active phase into a unique absorbing state .",
    "the transition is characterized by a positive one - component order parameter .",
    "3 .   the dynamic rules involve only short - range interactions .",
    "finally , the system has no special attributes like additional symmetries or quenched randomness .",
    "any model satisfying all above four conditions has been found to belong to dp universality class , with no exception to date .",
    "however , it is known that at least some of the above dp conditions can be relaxed .",
    "in fact , there are a few examples of systems that , despite exhibiting no absorbing states @xcite or having quenched disorder @xcite also display nonequilibrium phase transitions that belong to the dp universality class .",
    "our model does not have absorbing states , since in both the rough and the flat phase the interface keeps fluctuating .",
    "also and perhaps most importantly , interaction is not short - ranged , because of the avalanches of activity that give rise to nonlocal effects with finite probability .",
    "their influence in the dynamics is reflected by the extremly low value of the dynamic exponent , @xmath81 @xmath82 , signature of a highly super - diffusive behavior .",
    "it appears that this nonlocal interaction mechanism is the responsible for the deviation of the dp critical behavior .",
    "we believe that the transition takes place exactly at @xmath83 .",
    "this is directly related to the dynamical evolution rules of the model .",
    "we have defined the external driving by choosing a random number from a uniform distribution in @xmath13 $ ] . as a consequence , for @xmath84 , a random update on any site can generate an avalanche .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath85 , only a small fraction of sites will be able to generate an avalanche with a single update . in order to quantify this effect",
    "we have studied the fraction of sites which can generate an avalanche with a single update . a site @xmath8 with this property will satisfy @xmath86 in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we present the fraction of sites @xmath87 which are able to generate an avalanche as a function of c. the figure clearly shows that this fraction remains close to one for @xmath88 and drops abruptly to a small value for @xmath89 .",
