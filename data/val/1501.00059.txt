    "although most neutrino experiments can be well described by the standard three light species paradigm , there have been several anomalies that indicate a new sterile state  @xcite .",
    "the new state should have an ev scale mass and a mixing angle with @xmath1  @xcite . with such parameters",
    ", sterile neutrinos can be copiously produced from oscillation with each species increasing the effective number of neutrinos @xmath0 almost by one unit .",
    "this would be in tension with the cosmological bounds from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data  @xcite , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the conflict can be resolved if the sterile species is only partially thermalized with @xmath4 .",
    "partial thermalization can be realized in particle physics models where there are secret self - interactions in the sterile neutrino sector  @xcite .",
    "these self - interactions can induce large matter potentials , effectively suppress the mixing angle , and block sterile neutrino s production from oscillation efficiently  @xcite .    however , the situation changed recently when authors in  @xcite argued that even if sterile neutrinos production are blocked at bbn time , as the universe cools down , the new self - interaction will eventually equilibrate sterile neutrinos with the active ones .",
    "then , it can be easily shown that in 3 + 1 scenario , @xmath5 of the cosmic background neutrinos would be the heavy sterile ones , which is still in conflict with the above cosmological bounds .",
    "the novelty in this paper is that , we numerically solve the quantum kinetic equations for neutrino mixing , show and confirm that flavor equilibrium is indeed reached after bbn , see fig .",
    "[ fig : neffgx ] .",
    "we also propose that the above mentioned conflict can be reconciled easily in an extension that more than one sterile states are introduced . of",
    "the @xmath6 introduced self - interacting sterile species , only one has ev scale mass and mixes with the active neutrinos . in the early universe , all of them are out of equilibrium , but can approach flavor equilibrium with active neutrinos after bbn era .",
    "so the current relic neutrinos are composed of 3+n species with equal flavors .",
    "as we shall show that @xmath0 in the late universe can actually decrease and the cosmological bounds can be evaded . to be consistent with the latest _",
    "results , we found that @xmath7 is the minimal number of the introduced sterile species .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "overview ] , we briefly review the effective number of neutrinos , @xmath0 . in section  [ sec : neff ] , we discuss the scenario that how @xmath0 in bbn epoch can be different from its value in cmb time when there are secret self - interactions among sterile neutrinos . in section  [ sec : massbounds ] , we show how the cosmological mass bounds on sterile neutrino can be relaxed if more than one light species are introduced .",
    "finally , we give our conclusion .",
    "in this section , we shall review @xmath9 briefly and establish the related conventions and definitions .",
    "first , let us recall the thermal history of neutrinos in the standard model ( sm ) at the early universe .",
    "when the temperature of the thermal bath , @xmath10 , is much higher than mev , active neutrinos , @xmath11 , are in thermal equilibrium with other sm particles through electroweak processes and have the same temperature as @xmath10 . around 2 mev ,",
    "active neutrinos are decoupled because electroweak interaction is not strong enough to keep them in equilibrium .",
    "later , electrons / positrons annihilate but heat only the photons . using the conservation of entropy density ,",
    "one can obtain the temperature ratio after @xmath12 annihilation , @xmath13 afterwards , @xmath14 is constant in the standard cosmology .",
    "@xmath9 is defined by the energy density ratio , @xmath15 where @xmath16 stands for the total energy density of radiations . in the standard model",
    ", we have 3 species of active neutrinos , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , so @xmath19 , or @xmath20 precisely if instantaeneous neutrino decoupling is relaxed .",
    "if there is some new physics , it might modify @xmath14 and/or contribute to @xmath21 as extra radiation .",
    "for example , dark matter may affect @xmath22  @xcite or @xmath23  @xcite , and new particles can decay to or contribute as equivalent neutrinos  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we only consider the extended models with sterile neutrinos .    in the following discussions ,",
    "we shall use @xmath11 to denote the 3 active neutrinos , @xmath24 for the sterile species , and @xmath25 or @xmath26 for all of them if not otherwise specified . and",
    "@xmath27 will be referred as the @xmath28-th mass eigenstate with a mass @xmath29 . for the parameter space we focus on , @xmath30 are mainly mixed states of active neutrinos @xmath31 and @xmath32s @xmath33",
    "are mainly mixed sterile species .",
    "we shall also neglect the masses of @xmath30 when considering the mass constraints on sterile neutrinos .    in principle , @xmath0 can be a function of time or photon temperature .",
    "we define @xmath34 as the deviation from the standard value , with explicit time / temperature dependence , @xmath35,\\ ] ] or @xmath36 where @xmath37 stands for the neutrino temperature in the standard cosmology without new physics , @xmath38 before @xmath12 annihilation and @xmath39 afterwards , and @xmath40 runs through all active / sterile neutrinos .",
    "we shall keep in mind that @xmath41 in eqs .",
    "[ eq : neff ] and [ eq : deltaneff ] is actually @xmath20 precisely .",
    "but this little difference would not affect our later discussions and we shall use @xmath41 throughout the paper .",
    "s are not in thermal equilibrium with @xmath31s because of the suppression from a large matter potential . as the universe cools down , equilibrium between active and sterile neutrinos could be reached .",
    "[ fig : thermalhistory ] ]    in this section , we discuss how self - interaction can affect the thermalization of sterile neutrinos .",
    "the essential picture is described in fig .  [",
    "fig : thermalhistory ] where sterile neutrinos are only partially thermalized at / before bbn time , but flavor equilibrium , @xmath44 , is reached at later time . to be as general as possible , we introduce @xmath6 sterile species and do not discuss the specific particle physics models , but emphasize that new interaction for the sterile neutrinos is required .",
    "it should be pointed out that in the present discussion for illustrating our points , the minimal setup we need is that _ one _ of the @xmath6 sterile species is mixed with active neutrinos and has ev - scale mass , and the rest may be massless and have negligible mixing to affect current neutrino experimental results . moreover",
    ", sterile neutrinos do not have to mix with each other since all sterile neutrinos can be in flavor equilibrium through new interactions .",
    "therefore , let us just simply assume there is only mixing between a 4-th neutrino and the active species , namely the mixing matrix has the following form , @xmath45 further assume only @xmath46-@xmath47 mixing and cp conservation , then the complete @xmath48 mixing matrix is @xmath49 where e.g. @xmath50 and @xmath51 , etc .",
    "complete investigations with the above multiple - flavor mixing are quite involved numerically when solving the full quantum kinetic equations ( qkes )  @xcite and we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite for multiple - flavor analysis with non - interacting sterile neutrinos . for simplicity and without loss of generality",
    ", we work with only two neutrino states , @xmath52-@xmath24 mixing with mass difference @xmath53 and mixing angle @xmath54 , and shall pay our attention to ev sterile neutrinos with the parameter space suggested by neutrino anomalies , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we shall keep in mind that @xmath57 produced from @xmath58 and @xmath59 s oscillation could be equally important since @xmath60 .    in most of the previous discussions in the literature ,",
    "sterile neutrinos are assumed to have no interaction , so they can only be produced by oscillations from the active ones . and",
    "the production rate and total amount depend on the mass difference , mixing angle and lepton asymmetry  @xcite .    in case of sterile species having a secret self - interaction , parametrized by @xmath61 ( similar to the fermi s constant @xmath62 in sm ) , @xmath63",
    "the production will also depend on the strength of @xmath64",

    "the self - interaction can suppress the production of sterile neutrino at high temperature , but lead to flavor equilibrium at later time .",
    "increasing the strength of self - interacting would delay the equilibrium time .",
    "[ fig : neffgx],scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the introduced self - interactions for sterile neutrinos have two effects .",
    "one is to block the thermalization at high temperature .",
    "the other effect is the collisions that lead a scattering - induced decoherent production at later time . in fig .",
    "[ fig : neffgx ] , we show the non - interacting case with a black curve and compare it with two interacting cases , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "if @xmath64 is large , for instance @xmath88 , @xmath24 can only be partially thermalized with @xmath89 when @xmath90mev .",
    "however , if @xmath64 is not large enough , for instance @xmath87 , it will block the thermalization first at high temperature but enhance the production of sterile neutrino at a later time even before bbn epoch , @xmath91mev .",
    "the @xmath88 case , however , has shown that the equilibrium time is later than the @xmath87 case , less than @xmath92 . generally , increasing @xmath64 would delay the equilibrium time .",
    "a simplified picture to understand these two effects is to use the effective mixing angle , @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the energy of oscillating neutrino , @xmath95 is usually called the vacuum oscillation term  @xcite , and @xmath96 is the matter potential",
    ". simple analysis would give @xmath97 which highly depend on the temperature .",
    "a familiar case , msw effect  @xcite , happens when @xmath98 , leading to a maximal mixing angle @xmath99 .",
    "however , when the matter potential is much larger than the vacuum term , the mixing angle is effectively suppressed , @xmath100 which can efficiently block the production of sterile neutrinos .",
    "the value of @xmath101 to block production at bbn time can be roughly estimated as follows : @xmath102 take @xmath103 and @xmath104 gev , we get @xmath105mev around bbn time . this is what wee see the smallness of @xmath101 all the way to bbn time from the dot - dashed line in fig .",

    "@xmath106 gets smaller very quickly . when @xmath107 , matter effect can be neglected and @xmath108 .",
    "again , we discuss in the simplified framework of two - flavor case , @xmath31-@xmath24 or @xmath109-@xmath110 in the mass eigenstates , @xmath111 before bbn , because of the highly suppressed @xmath112 , there are mostly @xmath31 or @xmath109 neutrinos in the thermal bath , and a small amount of @xmath24 or @xmath110 states .",

    "if @xmath117 is larger than hubble parameter @xmath118 , then @xmath109 and @xmath110 , or @xmath31 and @xmath24 , will reach equal numbers quickly .",
    "since the sterile neutrinos self - interaction will induce rapidly elastic scattering , @xmath119 , it can redistribute momenta among sterile neutrinos .",
