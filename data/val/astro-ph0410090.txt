    "there is a growing body of evidence for high - velocity , blueshifted absorption features in the hard ( 2  10  kev ) x - ray spectra of quasars .",
    "chartas et al .",
    "( 2002 ) first identified a pair of absorption features in the x - ray spectrum of the relatively high redshift quasar apm08279 + 5255 ( @xmath0 ) and proposed that they were due to highly ionized iron .",
    "they were unable , however , to identify the ionization stage with certainty .",
    "more recently , pounds et al .",
    "( 2003a ) have identified narrow absorption features in the spectrum of the nearby quasar pg1211 + 143 . in this case , the identification of an x - ray line at @xmath1  kev with the significantly blueshifted ( @xmath2 ) k  @xmath3 transition of fe  xxv or xxvi was supported by the identification of other , weaker features at softer energies .",
    "similar narrow absorption features have also now been reported in a second high - redshift quasar ( pg1115 + 080 , chartas , brandt & gallagher 2003 ) and a second low - redshift quasar ( pg0844 + 349 , pounds et al .",
    "in addition , high velocity absorption has been reported in yet another quasar ( pds456 ) by reeves , obrien & ward ( 2003 ) , although in this case the absorption is broader and the authors favour an interpretation involving absorption edges of fe  xvii - xxiv rather than lines of more highly ionized material .",
    "it has been suggested that these absorption features form in a fast , massive outflow from the accreting supermassive black hole in the quasar nucleus ( chartas et al .",
    "2002 , pounds et al .",
    "2003a , king & pounds 2003 ) . to account for the observed absorption features",
    "requires such flows to be both more highly ionized and have significantly greater column densities than necessary for the outflows detected via blueshifted ultraviolet absorption lines in broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars ( pounds et al .",
    "it is not yet established whether highly ionized fast outflows might be common in the quasar population , but it is clear that when present , they may carry sufficient energy to be important in the energy budget of accretion by the nuclear black hole .",
    "in addition , king & pounds ( 2003 ) have presented simple arguments to show that outflows from black holes accreting at around the eddington limit are likely to be optically thick giving rise to an xuv photosphere , emission from which may be responsible for the `` big blue bump '' ( bbb ) seen in quasar spectra .",
    "this interpretation , however , is not firmly established : in some instances ( e.g. apm08279 + 5255 ; chartas et al . 2002 ) there remains ambiguity in the line identification while in others ( pg1211 + 143 , pds456 ; mckernan , yaqoob & reynolds 2004 ) it has been suggested that some portion of the absorption features is due to gas in the vicinity of our galaxy , rather than material intrinsic to the quasar . in addition , kaspi ( 2004 ) has shown that many of the features in the spectrum of pg1211 + 143 can be explained by an alternative model involving a relatively small outflow velocity ( @xmath4  km  s@xmath5 ) .",
    "it is noted , however , that the preliminary study presented by kaspi ( 2004 ) addresses only the _ xmm - newton _ reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) data and not the european imaging camera ( epic ) data : it is not clear that a low - velocity outflow could explain the absorption features in the epic spectrum identified by pounds et al .",
    "( 2003a ) .    to better understand the hard x - ray absorption features and the potentially important outflows with which they may be associated requires synthesis of the x - ray spectrum predicted by plausible physical models . the primary goal of this paper is to perform realistic radiative transfer calculations and synthesise spectra in order to determine whether simple physical outflow models , as discussed by pounds et al .",
    "( 2003a ) and king & pounds ( 2003 ) , readily predict strong , narrow absorption features as required by the observations .",
    "a secondary objective is to use model spectra to constrain the plausible range of flow parameters by comparison with the data for a particular quasar .",
    "this investigation is focused on the narrow emission line quasar pg1211 + 143 .",
    "of the two nearby quasars in which narrow hard x - ray absorption lines have been detected by pounds et al .",
    "( 2003a , b ) , this object has been chosen over the other candidate ( pg0844 + 349 ) since the observational data is of higher quality and a wider variety of absorption features have been identified .",
    "pg1211 + 143 is bright , nearby ( @xmath6 , marziani et al .",
    "1996 ) and known to be radiating at around the eddington luminosity ( boroson 2002 , gierliski & done 2004 ) . based on simple ionized absorber fits to the data , pounds et al .",
    "( 2003a ) suggest the high - velocity outflow in pg1211 + 143 has a mass - loss rate @xmath7  m@xmath8  yr@xmath5 , and they suggest that the outflow is likely to subtend a wide opening angle as viewed from the central black hole .",
    "this work is also of general interest for the study of radiative transfer in non - spherical outflows .",
    "it will be shown that calculations for conical geometries are significantly different from spherical outflow , primarily owing to the influence of photon leakage through the conical boundary .    during the refereeing of this article , everett & ballantyne ( 2004 ) presented a related study on radiatively driven outflows from black holes .",
    "they investigated continuum driven flows and conclude that , while such flows are possible , they are likely to be too highly ionized to produce absorption line features .",
    "they did not , however , investigate line or mhd driven outflows nor consider multi - dimensional radiative transfer effects .    in section 2 , the outflow model that will be considered",
    "is discussed .",
    "the calculations presented in this paper have been performed with a monte carlo radiative transfer code which has been adapted from the code written by sim ( 2004 ) .",
    "the code uses the macro atom formalism developed by lucy ( 2002 , 2003 ) and is discussed in section 3 .",
    "section 4 identifies the atomic data used in the monte carlo simulations .",
    "the spectra computed from various models are discussed in section 5 and conclusions drawn in section 6 .",
    "the geometry adopted in this investigation is that of a bi - conical outflow as discussed by pounds et al .",
    "( 2003a ) and king & pounds ( 2003 ) .",
    "the flow has opening angle @xmath9 and is launched at radius @xmath10 from the supermassive black hole at the core of the quasar .",
    "figure  1 shows a cartoon of this flow geometry .",
    "note that in the limit @xmath11  a spherical wind with no obscuring material is recovered . in the subsections below , the various physical quantities which are required for the radiative transfer calculations are discussed .",
    "+      it is assumed that the velocity of the flow increases monotonically outward and is a function of radius ( @xmath12 ) alone .",
    "a simple @xmath13-type velocity law ( of the form commonly used in modelling stellar winds ) is adopted    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the outflow velocity at the base of the wind ( i.e. at @xmath16 ) and is assumed to be negligibly small ; @xmath17 is the terminal velocity of the flow , which is constrained by the observed line shifts ; and @xmath13 controls the rate of acceleration in the wind .",
    "given the velocity , the mass density @xmath18 is determined by the equation of mass conservation for an outflow with mass - loss rate @xmath19    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the fraction of solid angle subtended by the flow as viewed from the coordinate origin .",
    "the ionization state of all the elements included in the calculation is computed from the radiation field on the assumption of ionization equilibrium . during the monte carlo simulations , estimators for the photoionization rate in each bound - free continuum",
    "are obtained ( following lucy 2003 , see section 3 ) and used to compute the ionization state by balancing against radiative recombination rates .",
    "collisional ionization is neglected  this is expected to be a good approximation in view of the intense radiation field and the high ionization potential of the ions important to this study .",
    "the radiative recombination rates depend on the local electron energy distribution .",
    "since thermal balance is not pursued here , this energy distribution is not calculated in detail but is assumed to be maxwellian with a fixed electron temperature , @xmath22 .",
    "the adopted value of @xmath22 is discussed in section 5 .",
    "all the x - ray spectral lines of interest are ground state transitions and so the excitation of levels above the ground state has little effect on the calculations .",
    "therefore the following prescription for excitation is adopted    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the level population ( number density ) for an excited state @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the population of the ground state and @xmath27 is a chosen radiation temperature .",
    "the geometric dilution factor is given by @xmath28 and the notation @xmath29 indicates that the quantity in parenthesis should be evaluated in lte at temperature @xmath27 . in practice , @xmath27 is set equal to @xmath22 throughout .",
    "+    the monte carlo simulations require that the incoming energy spectrum at the base of the wind be specified . in this paper ,",
    "the incoming spectrum consists of three distinct components ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "energetically , the dominant component is that of the accretion disk around the central black hole .",
    "this component is modelled by a simple multi - colour black - body spectrum ( mitsuda et al . 1984 ) .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of the disk was obtained from equation  4 of mitsuda et al .",
    "( 1984 ) with the disk inner radius @xmath30 and the outer radius @xmath31 ( @xmath32 is the schwarzchild radius of the black hole ) . since pg1211 + 143",
    "is believed to be accreting at , or close to , the eddington limit ( boroson 2002 , gierliski & done 2004 ) , the total disk luminosity was fixed at the eddington luminosity .",
    "the mass of the central black hole , which is required for the calculation of @xmath32 and the eddington luminosity , is taken to be @xmath33m@xmath8 ( kaspi et al . 2000 ) .    at hard x - ray wavelengths the continuum spectrum",
    "is well described by a simple power law which most probably arises through inverse compton scattering of seed disk photons in an optically thin region in or near the disk .",
    "the formation of this power law is not addressed here but it is included as part of the input spectrum .",
    "the photon power law index @xmath34 is adopted ( the observed index for pg1211 + 143 has been determined by pounds et al . [ 2003a ] from both _ xmm - newton _ pn and mos data yielding respectively @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) .",
    "the normalisation of the power - law component relative to that of the disk is chosen in order to obtain consistency with the observed x - ray ( 2  10 kev ) luminosity . to achieve this",
    ", the normalisation is adjusted iteratively in the monte carlo calculations ( see section 3.6 ) .    at soft x - ray energies a significant excess of emission",
    "is observed relative to the power - law component ( pounds et al .",
    "this soft - excess is included in the input spectrum here .",
    "its shape is modelled by a black - body with temperature @xmath37  k , the temperature of the primary black - body component fitted to the spectrum by pounds et al .",
    "( 2003a ) .",
    "the normalisation of this component is fixed to that of the power - law by the observation that the intensity of the soft - excess component is approximately equal to that of the hard power - law at @xmath38  kev ( see figure 3 of pounds et al .",
    "an excess of emission in the soft x - ray band is common in quasars but its origin is not well understood ( see e.g. gierliski & done [ 2004 ] for a recent discussion ) . for the purposes of this paper , however , the soft excess is of relatively little concern since it is not a major contributor to the hard x - ray region .",
    "the code used to perform radiative transfer calculations is based on that discussed by sim ( 2004 ) which uses the macro atom formalism recently developed by lucy ( 2002,2003 ) .",
    "the principles of the code are briefly discussed below , with particular emphasis on those aspects that differ from the sim ( 2004 ) code .",
    "the code adopts a bi - conical geometry with opening angle @xmath9 ( see section 2 and figure 1 ) . in practise",
    "the radiative transfer calculation is performed in one cone and then the relevant parameters of the flow ( e.g. the mass - loss rate @xmath19 ) are doubled to account for the bi - conical structure .",
    "energy packets are launched through the surface at the base of the cone ( radius @xmath39 from the black hole ) and their propagation through the cone is tracked in both radial ( @xmath12 ) and angular ( @xmath40 ) position until they leave the flow through the outer boundary at @xmath41 or the conical boundary at @xmath42 .",
    "the lower boundary @xmath43 is assumed to be reflecting so that no packets are lost through this surface .",
    "packets which pass through the outer boundary @xmath41 are assumed to escape to infinity while those that pass through the conical boundary are assumed to be destroyed by obscuring material ( such as might be present in the form of a dusty torus surrounding the agn [ antonucci & miller 1985 , pier & krolik 1992 ] , or the warm highly ionized medium [ whim ] discussed by elvis [ 2000 ] ) .",
    "it is assumed that no photons enter the flow through the conical boundaries . in practise",
    "there would be little effect if photons did enter via these boundaries provided that they are not hard enough to influence the ionization state of the material in the flow .",
    "the flow is divided into 100 cells in the radial direction equally spaced in @xmath44 .",
    "the outermost cell extends to @xmath45 . at present",
    "there is no angular ( @xmath40 ) stratification .",
    "the propagation of packets through the model is followed exactly as described by sim ( 2004 ) .",
    "the treatment of line interactions using the sobolev approximation and the macro atom formalism is also as described by sim ( 2004 ) , with the exception that bound - free processes are now included in the macro atom description .",
    "thus , in contrast to the photoionization modelling described by pounds et al .",
    "[ 2003a ] , the linewidths and profiles are computed rather than pre - specified .    following the formalism developed by lucy ( 2003 ) ,",
    "the calculations presented here include bound - free absorption and emission ( including the creation and destruction of @xmath46-packets ) which were neglected by sim ( 2004 ) . in addition , since x - ray photons are under investigation , electron scattering is no longer treated in the limit of thompson scattering but is generalised to account for compton scattering as described in the next subsection .",
    "the electron scattering cross - section presented to an @xmath12-packet is computed using the klein - nishina equation for the differential cross - section on the assumption that the target electrons are stationary in the co - moving frame ( see e.g. leighton 1959 ) .",
    "when electron scattering occurs , the scattering angle is selected from a pre - tabulated look - up table of the angular probability distribution as a function of incident photon energy using the klein - nishina equation .",
    "physically , when a photon undergoes compton scattering some fraction of its energy ( @xmath47 , which is readily related to the photon frequency and scattering angle ) is passed to the electron , reducing the frequency , and therefore energy , of the photon .",
    "however , such a splitting of energy is not desirable in the context of the `` indivisible energy packet '' approach adopted here .",
    "therefore @xmath47 is identified as the probability that during a compton scattering event the @xmath12-packet is converted insitu to a @xmath46-packet ( which is subsequently eliminated by thermal cooling processes in the usual way ) and @xmath48 is the probability that the packet will continue to propagate as an @xmath12-packet with diminished frequency but unchanged energy ( in the co - moving frame ) . when averaged over many interactions ,",
    "this approach reproduces the physics of compton scattering exactly without the need to divide energy packets at any point .",
    "it is noted that this scheme for the treatment of compton scattering assumes that the electron rapidly comes back into thermal equilibrium with its surroundings following the interaction with the photon .",
    "this assumption is adequate here but in principle could be lifted to allow the energy carried by non - thermal electrons to be followed during monte carlo simulations when necessary .",
    "this is likely to be important when the methods are generalised to include inverse compton scattering .",
    "for the formal calculation of the emergent spectrum ( see section 3.7 ) , monte carlo estimators are needed not only for the sobolev mean intensity in the spectral lines ( @xmath49 , given by equation 10 of sim [ 2004 ] ) but also for the mean intensity in both the far blue ( @xmath50 ) and red ( @xmath51 ) wings of the lines and also for a weighted mean intensity in the far blue wing ( @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the specific intensity in the far blue wing , @xmath54 is the sobolev optical depth and @xmath55 indicates an angular average ) .",
    "estimators for these quantities in each cell are readily constructed following lucy ( 1999 , 2003 ) :    @xmath56    @xmath57    @xmath58    in each case @xmath59 is the time interval represented by the monte carlo simulation , @xmath60 is the volume of the cell in question , @xmath61 is the packet energy and @xmath62 is the gradient of co - moving frequency with path - length . in the first and third cases the summation runs over all packets",
    "as they redshift _ into _ resonance with the line and in the second case the summation is over packets as they redshift _ out _ of resonance with the line .    in principle , monte carlo estimators for the photoionization rate and stimulated recombination rate ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) should be obtained using equations 44 and 45 of lucy ( 2003 ) .",
    "however , since the line estimators presented above provide a closely spaced grid of values for @xmath65 in each cell it is possible to obtain @xmath63 and @xmath64 by integrating over this grid .",
    "this method has been adopted since it noticeably reduces the run time of the code ( when the bound - free estimators are computed directly a significant fraction of computer time is spent on recording the large number of small contributions to these estimators which arise because of the large number of electron scattering events ) . although estimators obtained by this approach are slightly less accurate than those obtained with equations 44 and 45 of lucy ( 2003 ) , they are still of higher quality than those for the individual lines and since it is necessary to simulate a large enough number of packets that the line estimators are reliable , then it is acceptable to compute the bound - free estimators from the line estimators and obtain a similar degree of accuracy .      the time interval represented by the monte carlo simulation , @xmath59",
    "is determined by the observed 2  10 kev luminosity , @xmath66  ergs  s@xmath5 for pg1211 + 143 ( pounds et al .",
    "2003a ) . during the monte carlo simulation ,",
    "the total energy in the 2  10 kev energy band carried by packets through the outer boundary of the model ( @xmath67 ) is recorded and used to obtain the time interval via    @xmath68    where , as usual , @xmath69 is the fraction of solid angle subtended by the flow .",
    "the time interval ( @xmath59 ) is used both for the normalisation of the monte carlo estimators ( see section 3.4 ) and for determining the relative normalisation of the power - law and disk components of the input spectrum in the next iteration .",
    "each complete run of the code involves several iterations of the monte carlo calculation to converge the monte carlo estimators , ionization fractions and the relative normalisation of the disk and power - law components of the input spectrum .",
    "initially it is assumed that the flow is fully ionized and a monte carlo simulation ( with a relatively small number of energy packets ) is performed to obtain preliminary values for the photoionization rates .",
    "these are used to compute more realistic ionization fractions before performing additional monte carlo simulations . in each successive simulation",
    "the monte carlo estimators obtained from the previous simulation are used to compute the ionization fractions and the macro atom jumping / de - activation probabilities .",
    "also , the time interval ( section 3.5 ) is used to obtain the relative normalisation of the components of the input radiation field .",
    "typically five iterations were performed to converge the final values of the estimators to sufficient accuracy for the spectral synthesis step described below .      while it is possible to produce spectra from monte carlo simulations directly by examining the frequency distribution of the energy packets emerging from the computational domain , it has been demonstrated by lucy ( 1999 ) that far higher quality spectra may be obtained by using the monte carlo estimators to perform a formal integral solution of the transfer equation .",
    "the accuracy of the spectrum generated in this manner is limited not by the monte carlo noise in the outgoing packet frequency distribution but by the monte carlo noise in the estimators which is significantly lower .",
    "a brief discussion of the method of spectral synthesis is given below with particular attention given to the differences from lucy ( 1999 ) .      to compute the outgoing spectrum , the specific intensity at each frequency @xmath70",
    "is traced along a set of paths through the model with a range of impact parameters .",
    "the total emergent intensity is determined by numerical integration over the impact parameter ( see lucy 1999 ) .",
    "it is assumed that the observer lies directly above the axis of symmetry of the flow ( the line @xmath71 ) .",
    "initially , the intensity of the ray is either set to that of the input radiation field ( if the impact parameter is sufficiently small that the ray trajectory originates on the inner surface boundary at @xmath10 ) or to zero ( if the impact parameter is large enough that the ray originates on either the conical boundary [ bi - conical models ] or the outer edge of the rear hemisphere [ spherical models ] ) . the intensity of the beam is then traced along the path to the edge of the model in the following way .",
    "first , the distance the ray must travel until the comoving frequency of the photons with which it is associated becomes redshifted into a spectral line is found .",
    "the continuum optical depth @xmath72 and source function @xmath73 are computed for this path length , including contributions from both electron scattering and bound - free processes .",
    "the continuum source function is given by    @xmath74    where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the optical depths due to electron scattering and bound - free processes respectively . since the ionization fractions have already been computed from the radiation field and the important bound - free processes all involve recombinations from ground states , the bound - free source function @xmath77 is computed directly from the ionization fractions in the usual way .",
    "the source function for electron scattering is assumed to be isotropic and given by the mean intensity , @xmath65 , which is obtained by interpolation between the value of @xmath78 for the next spectral line to the blue and @xmath79 for the next spectral line to the red ( in the comoving frame ) .",
    "the values of @xmath78 and @xmath79 are already determined by the estimators discussed in section 3.4 .",
    "once the intensity is known at the point where the ray is redshifted into a spectral line , the effect of the line on the intensity of the ray is accounted for using    @xmath80    where @xmath81 is the incoming intensity at the far blue wing of the line , @xmath82 is the outgoing intensity at the far red wing of the line , @xmath83 is the line source function and @xmath84 is the sobolev optical depth of the line ( which depends on @xmath85 , the cosine of the angle between the ray direction and the radial direction ) .",
    "since level populations are _ not _ computed self - consistently then it is not appropriate to compute @xmath83 from the level populations but rather from the monte carlo estimators for the radiation field .",
    "this is achieved by averaging the above equation over @xmath85 to obtain an expression for @xmath83 in terms of mean intensities    @xmath86    since estimators have been recorded for both @xmath51 and @xmath87 ( see section 3.4 ) this allows @xmath83 to be evaluated without reference to the level populations . once the ray has passed though resonance with the line , the distance to the next line is computed and the effects of continuum opacity up to that line are accounted for as before .",
    "this processes of alternately accounting for the continuum and lines is continued until the ray reaches the top of the model whereupon the outgoing intensity is recorded and used to compute the spectrum . in practise , since the x - ray region is relatively sparsely populated with spectral lines , the gridding obtained for the computation of the electron scattering source function is rather coarse .",
    "this is easily overcome by introducing additional fake spectral lines in the monte carlo simulation .",
    "these are defined to have zero optical depth and so do not affect the propagation of energy packets but they do cause @xmath65 to be computed on a finer frequency mesh , as required .",
    "the number of energy packets used in each simulation is chosen in order that the monte carlo noise in the estimators is @xmath88  per cent .",
    "this level of precision is sufficient given the limited quality of the observational data available at present . to this accuracy",
    ", the transformation between the comoving and observer rest frame can be taken as galilean and the doppler shift treated as non - relativistic .",
    "if higher accuracy were to be required it would become necessary to consider special relativistic corrections ( which are of order @xmath89 ) . including such corrections",
    "poses no significant problems to the operation of the code but in view of the precision required here they can be neglected for simplicity .",
    "table  1 lists the elements and ions included in the calculations described below . for light elements only hydrogen- and helium - like ions",
    "are included , but lower ionization stages are included for iron and nickel .",
    "the element abundances , relative to hydrogen , are assumed to be solar .",
    "atomic models , bound - bound oscillator strengths and bound - free cross - sections have been extracted from the _ xstar _ database ( bautista & kallman 2001 ) . in the calculations ,",

    "@xmath93 bound - free continua are included in the calculations .",
    "@xmath94 to obtain a single fwhm for the fe blend at 7.5  kev , the computed spectrum was convolved with a gaussian of fwhm = 10,000  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the fwhm reported in the table is that measured from the convolved spectrum .      at higher temperatures",
    "the spectral features become weaker while at lower temperatures they become stronger .",
    "this is due to the influence of the temperature on the recombination rates  at high temperatures the flow is more highly ionized than at low temperatures .",
    "it suggests a degeneracy between high densities and low temperatures but this is lifted when the linewidths are considered  high densities tend to lead to narrower lines ( see table  2 ) because of the ionization gradient they introduce ( see section  5.2.2 ) but a low temperature does not change the gradient of ionization and therefore does not cause the lines to become narrower .",
    "this means that a simple change in the temperature can not simultaneously address the shortcomings of the low density spherical models discussed in section 5.1 ( i.e. changing the adopted value of @xmath22 will not cause the lines to be both narrower and stronger ) .",
    "however , the temperature does have a quantitative effect on the lines via its influence on the ionization balance .    in the future",
    ", calculations will be presented in which the temperature is computed by balancing radiative heating and cooling processes , following e.g. lucy ( 2003 ) .",
    "such work will allow for the interesting possibility of variations of @xmath22 with @xmath12 : if present , this would affect the gradient of ionization which is central to obtaining narrow line profiles in the models discussed here .",
    "it is possible that a steep gradient of electron temperature would permit lower ionization stages to form in the outermost parts of the flow , thereby helping to explain many of the lines observed in the rgs spectrum of pg1211 + 143 ."
