    "the differentially heated rotating fluid annulus is a widely studied experimental apparatus for modeling large - scale features of the mid - latitude atmosphere ( planetary waves , cyclogenesis , etc . ) . in the classic set - up ,",
    "first studied by the group of fultz ( 1959 ) and , in parallel by fowlis and hide ( 1965 ) , a rotating cylindrical tank is divided into three coaxial sections : the innermost domain is kept at a lower temperature , whereas the outer rim of the tank is heated .",
    "the working fluid in the annular gap in between thus experiences lateral temperature difference @xmath0 in the radial direction , which initiates a ` sideways - convective ' circulation .",
    "these boundary conditions imitate the meridional temperature gradient of the terrestrial atmosphere between the poles and the equator .",
    "the coriolis effect arising due to the rotation of the tank modifies this axisymmetric basic flow markedly , and leads first to the formation of an azimuthal flow and then to baroclinic instability with cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies in the full water depth . in the present work ,",
    "we study a modified version of this experiment , in which  besides the aforementioned radial temperature difference  vertical salinity stratification is also present .    whereas the baroclinic instability experiments are classical models of mid - latitude atmospheric dynamics , our aim is to create a juxtaposition of convective and motionless stratified layers in the laboratory .",
    "we expect therefore that the lessons learned from our original experimental set - up may well be useful for future laboratory arrangements ( in somewhat different geometries and material properties ) that could mimic the convective and radiative zones of stars , the tropospheres and stratospheres of planetary atmospheres or the surface turbulent sea layers above deeper stratified waters .",
    "let us stress in particular that the exchange of momentum and energy between these layers ( in particular by the propagation of internal gravity waves ) is a major issue in astrophysics , in atmospheric sciences as well as in oceanography .",
    "therefore , we claim that our present set - up may lead to new insights in geo- and astrophysical applications ( plougonven and snyder , 2007 ; nettelmann , 2015 ) .",
    "small variations in the density of a fluid parcel ( @xmath1 ) are connected to those of salinity ( @xmath2 ) and temperature ( @xmath3 ) in the form of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the coefficients of thermal expansion and saline contraction , respectively .",
    "the global thermohaline ocean circulation is driven by the endless competition between the thermal and saline contributions to the buoyancy of each and every parcel of seawater ( vallis , 2006 ) .",
    "better understanding the nature of this complex interplay has been the key motivation of the present study .",
    "large enough ( stable ) vertical salinity gradients may inhibit the formation of full - depth ( unicellular ) overturning flow , even in such laterally heated systems as the rotating annulus experiments . the vertical extent @xmath7 of a convective cell",
    "is naturally limited by the condition that the initial ( saline ) density difference between the top and bottom of the cell can not exceed the ( thermal ) horizontal density difference between the lateral sidewalls , i.e. : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the average density within the cell .",
    "this scale can be expressed with buoyancy frequency @xmath10 , in the form @xmath11 this characteristic vertical scale of ( non - rotating ) _ double - diffusive convection _ is referred to as the chen scale , since the pioneering experimental analysis of chen ( 1971 ) .",
    "within each cell the convective flow yields mixing and the initial stratification vanishes .",
    "thus , a so - called ` double - diffusive staircase ' develops with jump - wise density changes between these locally homogenized cells .",
    "double - diffusive staircases are formed in natural water bodies , ranging from saline lakes to oceans ( boehrer , 2012 ; schmitt , 1994 ) . however , due to the inevitable mixing between the cells , such configurations are mostly transient . hopefully ,",
    "as the spatial scales involved in the baroclinic as well as in the convective instabilities are quite large , the transient characteristic times calculated on these lengths are long enough to permit a full investigation .",
    "some of the experimental runs that we will describe later lasted several days .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after having recalled the basic principles of double - diffusive convection ( and its response to rotation ) and then of the baroclinic instability , in sections [ ddconv ] and [ baro ] respectively , in section [ setup ] we describe our experimental arrangement and measurement methods .",
    "section [ results ] is devoted to the presentation of the results and their analysis that will concern two sets of experimental runs . in the first set ( subsection [ simple ] ) , the salinity profiles were mainly linear ( with a single buoyancy frequency in the core of the fluid ) with two non - stratified regions at the top and bottom of the full water layer .",
    "the corresponding results permit to test the possibility to confine the baroclinic instability in two shallow layers separated by a motionless zone . in a second part of this result section ( subsection [ complex ] ) , more complex salinity profile",
    "have been realized with vertical variations of the buoyancy frequency . in this case ,",
    "multilayered convection sets in .",
    "the analysis is thus much more complex and necessitates a particular method to discriminate and quantify the dynamics inside these independent layers .",
    "section [ conclusion ] summarizes our main results and opens discussions on the future possibilities of our original experimental set - up .",
    "for the sake of qualitative demonstration , in fig .",
    "[ sim_profiles]a - c we present typical vertical profiles of total density , temperature , and horizontal velocity @xmath12 , from two - dimensional solutions of the non - rotating boussinesq equations , acquired via _ numerical simulation _ using the open - source software package advanced ocean modeling of kmpf ( 2010 ) .",
    "no - flux conditions were prescribed at the top and bottom boundaries of the rectangular solution domain , and differential heating was applied at its lateral walls : the temperature at the vertical sidewall at the left ( right ) hand side of the domain was prescribed to be @xmath13 k colder ( warmer ) that the initially uniform temperature @xmath14 of the fluid .",
    "the fluid had a stable and continuous vertical density gradient and was at rest at time zero .",
    "each profile of fig .",
    "[ sim_profiles ] was extracted from the vertical column at the middle of the domain .",
    "since these graphs serve demonstration purposes only , no units are given .",
    "in panel ( a ) it is clearly visible that the initial density stratification ( dashed line ) has developed into the aforementioned double - diffusive staircase ( solid line , red online ) ; see also the corresponding velocity profiles in panel c ) . in qualitative agreement with the formula ( [ lambda ] ) , the largest cells  both in terms of vertical size @xmath7 and of water flux  appear at mid - depths , where the initial salinity profile exhibited the smallest gradient .",
    "note , however , that in the regions characterized by the largest density gradients , the flow is basically blocked ( the horizontal velocities are practically zero ) : in the spirit of ( [ lambda ] ) , the large local @xmath15 would yield very shallow convective layers , but their formation is inhibited by viscous effects .",
    "this `` viscous cut - off '' bounds the cell thickness from below : it can not be smaller then a certain @xmath16 , or , in terms of the buoyancy frequency , there is a maximum @xmath17 , above which convection is locally blocked .    in their experiments , chen ( 1971 )",
    "investigated the development of convective rolls in a rectangular vertical tank filled up with saline water of initially uniform vertical stratification with differential heating at two opposing lateral walls .",
    "his results are expressed in terms of a certain version of rayleigh number @xmath18 , where the vertical scale is given by @xmath7  as derived from ( [ lambda ] )  and the characteristic temperature difference is measured between the lateral walls ; thus @xmath18 incorporates the effects of both the horizontal and the vertical density gradients : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the thermal diffusivity and @xmath21 is the kinematic viscosity of the working fluid .",
    "chen ( 1971 ) found that the critical value of @xmath16 or , equivalently , @xmath17 is encountered around @xmath22 , below which convection is inhibited .",
    "if @xmath18 exceeds this threshold , simultaneously or successively formed multicellular double - diffusive convection rolls can develop ( kranenborg and dijkstra , 1995 ) .    introducing _ rotation _ around the vertical axis modifies the dynamics of double - diffusive convection markedly , as demonstrated in the theoretical work of kerr ( 1995 ) .",
    "his conceptual set - up involves vertical salinity gradient and differentially heated lateral sidewalls with gapwidth @xmath23 , which rotate at angular velocity @xmath24 ( i.e. coriolis parameter @xmath25 ) .",
    "unlike chen , kerr defines separate rayleigh numbers for the vertical and horizontal directions ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively ) , both taken with the same length scale @xmath23 , which is , in fact , the only geometrical scale here , since the vertical extent of the domain is assumed to be infinite in the calculations .",
    "the horizontal rayleigh number @xmath26 reads as @xmath28 , whereas its vertical counterpart @xmath27 is given by @xmath29 .",
    "note , that based on these formulae , the chen scale @xmath7 ( defined in ( [ lambda ] ) ) , can be expressed as @xmath30 .",
    "kerr studied the @xmath31-dependence of the minimum @xmath32 , below which the flow is blocked , at different fixed values of @xmath27 and found two types of solutions in all cases .",
    "a schematic sketch of a typical stability diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ bifurc ] .",
    "one branch ( green curve ) is only slowly changing with @xmath31 : this result is consistent with the findings of chen ( 1971 ) in the @xmath33 limit case .     as a function of coriolis parameter @xmath31 , for a given @xmath27 .",
    "for slow rotations , the slowly changing branch  here , referred to as ` chen branch '  is stable , but above a certain threshold @xmath34 this branch vanishes , and only the sharply decreasing @xmath35 kerr s `` rotating branch '' survives.,width=377 ]    this branch vanishes at a certain threshold @xmath34 , whose value depends on @xmath27 : @xmath36 is an increasing function of @xmath27 . in the @xmath37 regime",
    "the other branch of solutions describes the appearance of a new regime ( orange curve in fig .",
    "[ bifurc ] ) .",
    "this branch decays in an inversely proportional manner with @xmath31  thus it is non - existent in the @xmath33 limit  and its parameter @xmath38 depends on @xmath27 as well : @xmath39 .        for a qualitative understanding of the effect of rotation on the double - diffusive background flow",
    "let us consider an experiment with counter - clockwise , i.e. ` northern hemisphere'-like , rotation .",
    "as observed from the co - rotating frame of reference , the coriolis force tends to push the horizontal flow branches to their right : at large enough values of rotation rate @xmath24 and/or horizontal velocity @xmath12 this action can yield strong zonal flows in the system .",
    "their directions are alternating with depth , corresponding to the convective branches of double - diffusive convective cells ; the coriolis effect yields _ zonal _ propagation in the presence of _ radial _ buoyancy gradient .",
    "this is demonstrated in the composite photo of fig .",
    "[ dye_demo ] taken during one of our experimental runs corresponding to the multi - layered cases that will be detailed in section [ complex ] .",
    "the figure presents the side view ( through the transparent glass walls of the rotating tank ) of dye patterns propagating away from a painted wooden stick ( black ) in ` eastward ' ( rightward ) and ` westward ' ( leftward ) zonal directions at rotation rate @xmath40 rpm , and average buoyancy frequency @xmath41 rad / s .",
    "it is important to emphasize , however , that the presence of baroclinic instability  resulting in zonal wave propagation in the annular tank ",
    "may largely add to the complexity of the emerging flow fields .",
    "note also that even if kerr ( 1995 ) never mentioned it , the solutions for @xmath37 seem very close in shape and wavelength to the classical baroclinic eddies .",
    "the most important non - dimensional parameter , traditionally used to describe the flow regimes in a rotating system with a finite kinematic viscosity @xmath21 is the taylor number @xmath42 , which reads as follows : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the vertical scale and @xmath23 is the ` gapwidth ' of the apparatus ( or more generally , the horizontal scale ) , as in the earlier formulae .",
    "another relevant parameter , the thermal rossby number @xmath45 is defined as the ratio of the characteristic velocity of the flow  driven by the relative density change in the lateral direction , @xmath46  to the rotation rate , in the form of @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the acceleration due to gravity .",
    "comparing the above formulae it is obvious that for a fixed @xmath0 ( as in the experiments to be discussed here ) , @xmath42 and @xmath45 are inversely proportional to each other and therefore the combination @xmath49 can sufficiently parametrize the flow in the given experimental setup .    in a certain region of the @xmath45@xmath42 parameter space",
    ", the slope of the isopycnal surfaces in the water ( which are not horizontal in this rotating system , due to thermal wind balance ) surpasses a critical threshold and _ baroclinic instability _ emerges ( vallis , 2006 ) . the extra potential energy stored in these tilted layers",
    "is then released via the excitation of complex wavy patterns , consisting of meandering zonal jets , accompanied by cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies . for @xmath50 k ( that is the typical case for this study , as will be discussed later ) the taylor number corresponding to the onset of baroclinic instability is @xmath51 ( or equivalently , @xmath52 ) ; above ( in terms of @xmath45 , below ) this threshold wave propagation is expected in the zonal direction ( von larcher and egbers , 2005 ) .    in the classic parametrization of homogeneous ( i.e. thermally driven ) baroclinic annulus experiments",
    "( vincze , 2014 ; vincze 2015 ) the vertical scale @xmath44 that appears in the definitions of non - dimensional numbers ( [ ta ] ) and ( [ ro ] ) corresponds to the total water level in the tank , since the sideways convective unicellular flow penetrates through the whole depth @xmath53 of the domain ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the presence of vertical salinity stratification however , yields a system of shallow - layer convective cells ( cf .",
    "[ dye_demo ] ) , whose thicknesses may be determined by chen s formula ( [ lambda ] ) , and by the cut - off value @xmath16 .",
    "therefore it is useful to introduce _ local _ versions of the taylor and thermal rossby numbers by taking @xmath55 as vertical scale , corresponding to the local @xmath15 .",
    "hence , the local thermal rossby number takes the form @xmath56 and the local @xmath57 is written as @xmath58 it is reasonable to assume that such parameter combinations exist , where the global taylor number calculated with the full water depth @xmath53 does not exceed @xmath59 , but the local taylor number @xmath57 , taken with the thickness of a given convective cell ( @xmath60 ) is already above the threshold",
    ". the multicellular state can therefore enhance baroclinic instability within the cells , and thus open the way for wave propagation in such configurations , which ( given their values of @xmath0 and @xmath24 ) would be stable in the homogeneous case . also , due to differences in cell thicknesses @xmath61",
    ", the ` baroclinicity ' ( i.e. the deviation of the flow field from the wave - free , axially symmetric state ) in the set - up may vary from cell to cell , thus different flow states may be observed at different depths .",
    "the experiments of the present study were conducted in the laboratory set - up shown in fig . [ setup ] . the working fluid consisted of sodium - chloride / de - ionized water solution , with lewis number @xmath62 , where @xmath20 and @xmath63 are the diffusion coefficients for heat and salt , respectively .",
    "the radii of the inner ( cooling ) and outer ( heating ) cylinders were @xmath64 cm and @xmath65 cm , yielding a @xmath66 cm wide annular cavity that was filled up to heights ranging from @xmath67 cm to @xmath68 cm in the different runs .",
    "the lateral temperature difference @xmath0 was set between 6 and 10 k in all cases .",
    "a continuously stratified salinity profile was prepared in the cavity before each measurement with the standard two - bucket technique ( oster and yamamoto , 1963 ) two vessels containing saline and fresh water are connected with a pipe so that the freshwater inflow to the saline bucket yields a mixture of ever decreasing salinity in time . by raising or lowering one of the buckets during this filling - up procedure , we were able to adjust the water fluxes into the mixing compartment and , thus , create arbitrarily non - uniform stable salinity profiles .",
    "cm , @xmath65 cm , @xmath69 cm , @xmath70 rpm , @xmath71 k. the direction of the tank s rotation is also indicated.,width=377 ]    our experiments investigated variations of the flow field with height for different types of initial salinity stratification .",
    "thus , the fluid was seeded with @xmath72 m - diameter tracers for particle image velocimetry ( piv ) . after filling up the tank ,",
    "the initial salinity profiles were measured using a hand - held conductivity sensor . then the differential heating was switched on .    even before starting rotation ,",
    "the onset of double diffusive convection could be observed visually .",
    "generally , most of the @xmath15-values corresponding to the prepared vertical profiles yielded smaller @xmath18 s than the aforementioned critical threshold of convection in a non - rotating system , @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , the convective flow in the bulk was mostly inhibited .",
    "however , the no - flux conditions for salinity at the bottom and the top of the water body translate to @xmath73 conditions at these regions in terms of buoyancy frequency .",
    "thus in thin layers at the vicinity of these boundaries where @xmath74 holds , localized convective cells could still partially invade the water column , as seen in fig .",

    "the system was left undisturbed for 30 - 40 minutes , thus the early transients of the rotating double - diffusive cell formation were not observed .",
    "then , piv measurements were conducted using horizontally illuminated laser sheets at different water depths .",
    "two slightly different arrangements were used for the two sets of experiments .",
    "for the first set , a camera together with a laser were fixed on an arm from the sidewall of the container ( ` narrow field ' observations ) .",
    "close - ups of the velocity fields could be acquired in this manner . in the second set of experiments , complete ` wide field ' views of the velocity fields in the full annulus",
    "could be observed from a co - rotating camera platform situated above the tank ( as depicted in fig .",
    "[ setup ] ) . alongside these piv cameras , for both sets of experiments an infrared thermographic camera was also mounted on the platform to enable the simultaneous observation of the temperature field at the free water surface . at the end of the piv measurements , rotation rate @xmath24",
    "was lowered gradually ( in the same manner as in the spin - up phase ) , and after the flow reached a full stop , a second salinity profile was also recorded .",
    "the observation of surface temperature patterns in the tank using infrared camera revealed that ",
    "contrarily to the initial nave expectations of the authors , but in full agreement with our hypothesis of baroclinic destabilization via the scale selection of @xmath7 , discussed subsection [ ddconv ]  in experiments with salinity stratification the layer at the water surface becomes baroclinic unstable at much lower rotation rates @xmath24 than in the homogeneous system .",

    "von larcher and egbers ( 2005 ) found  using the same experimental tank and @xmath0 as here , but with homogeneous working fluid  that the lower limit of the @xmath79 regime in terms of taylor number is around @xmath80 ( or somewhat below , at @xmath81 if ` spin - down ' initial conditions are applied ) . from the formula ( [ ta ] )",
    "one can therefore calculate that the maximum characteristic vertical scale of the convection has to be approximately @xmath82 cm to explain the observed wave number .",
    "taking this @xmath83 value as the chen scale of ( [ lambda ] ) yields a local buoyancy frequency @xmath84 rad / s .",
    "this is consistent with the measured salinity profile , although  due to the finite size of used the hand - held conductivity sensor  there are no measured data points from the uppermost layer of the initial profile . yet , based on the fact that 2 cm below the surface @xmath85 rad / s was measured , and on the aforementioned no - flux condition for salinity prescribing @xmath86 at the top , it is reasonable to interpolate @xmath84 rad / s for the considered region .",
    "moreover , @xmath87 cm also matches the observed thickness of the spontaneously forming convection cells at the boundaries , cf .",
    "[ no_rot_cells ] .",
    "in order to obtain a more quantitative relationship between @xmath15 and the ` baroclinicity ' of the flow , one needs to investigate the bulk of the working fluid , where the buoyancy frequency profiles can be properly determined .",
    "this domain , however , is not accessible for infrared thermography ( since the penetration depth of the applied infrared wavelength range in water is of the order of a millimeter ) .",
    "thus , the buoyancy frequencies directly could only be compared with piv data .      in this section",
    "we will present experiments which we started from particularly simple density profiles as illustrated in figure [ nprofileexp4]a .",
    "the buoyancy frequency @xmath15 is plotted versus the vertical coordinate in figure [ nprofileexp4]b . we performed different experiments at the following values of global parameters : @xmath88 k and @xmath89 rpm ( denoted as exp .",

    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ nprofileexp4 ] that the vertical density profile is almost linear . at the upper and lower boundaries the no - flux boundary condition imposes constant concentration and therefore constant density .",
    "thus , close to these boundaries @xmath15 approaches zero .",
    "is fairly constant around a value of @xmath95 rad / s , width=302 ]    contrarily to the non - stratified case , as explained in section [ ddconv ] , the imposed horizontal temperature gradient has to reach a certain threshold before sideways convection sets in .",
    "figure [ visuconv ] shows the top and bottom convective layers , where the fluid has been colored by the gentle injection of dye at the water surface . as visible and as expected , convection is confined in layers of water where stratification is small",
    "the thickness of this convective cell progresses slowly in time from around @xmath96 cm at threshold .        to obtain velocity vectors of the flow ,",
    "the piv method is suitable .",
    "as mentioned in section [ setup ] , in this series of experiments the narrow field camera ( gopro , 1080p , 30fps ) and the co - rotating laser sheet were utilized to acquire video information . for calculating the velocities we used successive frames taken at equally distributed time intervals with increment of @xmath97 s and we processed them with the public license matpiv toolbox .",
    "the advantages of using a co - rotating measurement system are that the camera can be positioned near the free surface and thus the resolution will increase , and we do nt need to correct the calculated velocities by subtracting the tank s rotation speed .",
    "as soon as rotation is started , a zonal flow is created by the action of the coriolis force on the convective currents .",
    "piv maps have been acquired for @xmath98 height levels .",
    "depending on the rotation rate , and also on the intensity of the convective velocities , these zonal flows can be either stable or unstable in terms of baroclinic instability .",
    "[ pivmap ] illustrates two horizontal close - ups of the velocity fields .",
    "the first one ( panel a ) is taken near the surface , inside the layer where convection is allowed to set in . here",
    "a baroclinic wave can be observed . at the convective region close to the bottom of the tank a convective cell appears too , but in contrast with the one near the surface it is baroclinic stable , possibly because the zonal flow is weakened by the bottom boundary layer .",
    "the next question is then to explore the possible generation of inertial - gravity waves ( igws ) by the instability as it can be the case for instance in unbalanced dynamics of atmospheres ; see for instance osullivan and dunkerton ( 1995 ) or plougonven and snyder ( 2007 ) .",
    "for the first time jacoby ( 2010 ) looked for igws in a classical continuously stratified , differentially heated rotating annulus .",
    "they found signatures for high - frequency waves but surprisingly the waves were related to boundary layer instabilities and not to the fronts of baroclinic waves .",
    "recently , borchert ( 2014 ) and randriamampianina and del arco ( 2015 ) numerically investigated the occurrence of igws by the baroclinic instability .",
    "the former claimed to have found igws generated spontaneously in accordance with the waves detected in a two - layer baroclinic annulus by lovegrove ( 2000 ) and williams ( 2003 ) .",
    "the latter showed that in the continuously stratified case with small prandtl number , igws are generated by kelvin - helmholtz instability and not via boundary layer instability .",
    "although we can not prove yet that the present instability can generically generate igws , the velocity field of fig .",
    "[ pivmap]a exhibits a wave train whose characteristics are compatible with igws .",
    "the second close up ( panel b ) corresponds to the calm region in the center of the tank , where convection is blocked due to the effect of the strong initial stratification .",

    "[ pivmean ] presents the vertical azimuthal velocity profile as measured in the experimental runs denoted exp.4 to exp.7 , as mentioned above .",
    "for each point we calculated the mean velocity over the whole investigated plane , which corresponds to approximatively one sixth of the cylindrical gap in the azimuthal direction . since the presence of baroclinic instability breaks the axial symmetry of the flow , temporal averaging",

    "generally , the smaller @xmath45 is , the closer the system gets to geostrophic turbulence , yielding smaller @xmath116 s , as expected .",
    "secondly , @xmath116 markedly anticorrelates with @xmath15 in itself too , despite of the differences in the rotation rates , underlining the robustness of the @xmath15-dependence : the steeper the stratification , the smaller the vertical convection scale becomes , supporting the development of shallow layer geostrophic turbulence , i.e. smaller @xmath116 .",
    "[ alldata]b shows the same data set , now colored with respect to the corresponding relative average absolute horizontal velocities @xmath129 , based on the piv fields .",
    "these values have been normalized so that @xmath130 corresponds to the largest observed average velocity .",
    "we found that two of the three weakest observed flow layers ( the two blue and green data points on the right of the plot ) appear at the largest buoyancy frequencies ( @xmath131 rad / s ) , which is in sharp contrast with the large velocities measured at only slightly smaller @xmath15 s .",
    "this may well imply that here the blocking threshold is approached , and above @xmath132 rad / s ( marked by a solid vertical line ) the convection is inhibited ; thus the corresponding parameters @xmath116 do not have actual physical meaning here , being results of the angle statistics of noise - dominated piv fields .",
    "the consistency of this finding with the theoretical background is addressed in the next section .",
    "chen ( 1971 ) and kerr ( 1995 ) have analyzed the conditions under which double diffusive convection can set on in laterally heated , initially stratified set - ups . for a non - rotating case",
    "the criterion ( as reported in the experimental study of chen ( 1971 ) ) was found to be that the ` combined ' rayleigh number , which incorporates the effects of both the salinity and the temperature gradients as defined in ( [ ra_chen ] ) , must exceed a certain threshold @xmath22 . from here",
    ", one can calculate the critical buoyancy frequency @xmath133 above which the viscous effects inhibit the formation of convective cells in our experimental tank . this estimation yields @xmath134 rad / s , which appears to be consistent with the observation that in the _ non - rotating _",
    "control experiments , cell formation was limited to the vicinity of the top and bottom boundaries , where @xmath15 is small ( see fig . [ no_rot_cells ] ) , and is also in fairly good agreement with the results of the first set of our _ rotating _ experiments , descussed in section [ simple ] .    based on this , we would barely see any flow in the bulk of the fluid at all , because most of our actual @xmath15-values scatter in the interval @xmath135 rad / s , as shown in figs .",
    "[ profiles ] and [ alldata ] . yet , in our second set of experiments , where more complex initial salinity profiles were investigated ( section [ complex ] ) , once rotation was turned on , an alternating zonal flow emerged at mid - depths as well ( see fig . [ dye_demo ] ) , implying convection .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to assume that in the rotating case the system can also exhibit another type of dynamics , which we referred to as the kerr branch .",
    "the states of this branch only exist in the presence of rotation , as seen in fig .",
    "[ bifurc ] .",
    "kerr s analysis is based on a horizontal rayleigh number @xmath28 and a vertical one @xmath29 , as discussed in subsection i.b .",
    "the average @xmath15 of our multilayered experiments yields @xmath136 , and their typical rotation rate @xmath137 rpm translates to @xmath138 in the dimensionless units applied in the analysis ( using @xmath139 as time units , cf .",
    "kerr ( 1995 ) ) . from here , using the data presented by kerr ( 1995 ) , we can also estimate that @xmath140 is the corresponding critical horizontal rayleigh number .",
    "knowing now the ratio @xmath141 , we can directly obtain the actual critical chen scale as @xmath142 , and finally , applying ( [ lambda ] ) , we arrive at the theoretical prediction of @xmath17 in the form of : @xmath143 that is in perfect agreement with the observed @xmath132 rad / s , implying that our multilayered experiments followed the ` kerr ( rotating ) branch ' of solutions , depicted in fig .",
    "[ bifurc ] .",
    "note , however , that  as mentioned above  our first set of experiments , where only two separate convective layers were observed at the small-@xmath15 regions of the top and bottom of the tank ,",
    "convection was blocked already at @xmath144 rad / s , and remained blocked , even when higher values of @xmath0 and @xmath31 were applied .",
    "this observation implies that the dynamics in these experiments stayed on the ` chen branch ' of fig .",
    "[ bifurc ] .",
    "the present study lacks an empirical determination of the breaking point @xmath34 , where  according to kerr s linear stability analysis  the chen branch is expected to vanish and the kerr to remain the only possible solution .",
    "this transition between the two types of solutions needs to be clarified by future experiments .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , we have reported here the very first experimental results on the combined effect of double convective and baroclinic instabilities in a rotating stratified layer and we decided to coin this phenomenon the ` barostrat instability ' . following the previous analyses of chen ( 1971 ) and kerr ( 1995 ) we have observed the formation of patterns with different azimuthal wave numbers . as expected ,",
    "these structures are confined in layers where the initial vertical density stratification was smaller .",
    "the thresholds for convective cell formation in terms of buoyancy frequency @xmath15 and the observed typical vertical length scales were found to be in agreement with the theoretical predictions .",
    "we hope that this study will open new routes in the study of atmospheric baroclinic instabilities : in particular let us remark that the stable stratified zone that lies under the unstable shallow layer in the experiment mimics the stratosphere above the baroclinic unstable layers of the troposphere .",
    "the next question is then to explore the possible generation of inertial - gravity waves by the barostrat instability as it can be the case for instance in the unbalanced dynamics of atmospheric fronts .    as closing remarks",
    ", we emphasize that it was somewhat counter - intuitive for the authors to find that the presence of moderately strong vertical salinity stratification can increase isotropy , i.e. enhance the development of baroclinic instability in certain shallow layers via the formation of double - diffusive cells .",
    "this is seemingly in contrast with reasoning that stable stratification ( large @xmath15 ) generally blocks baroclinic instability .",
    "our findings imply that  although , indeed , the unicellular full - depth overturning may be inhibited  the steeper the stratification is , the shallower the double - diffusive cells may be , which then decreases the local value of thermal rossby number @xmath45 , and by doing so , pushes the system ( i.e. the given sideways - convective layer ) towards quasi - geostrophic turbulence , as long as the stratification does not exceed a critical value @xmath17 above which the flow is indeed completely blocked .    with presenting the new findings of the present pilot study ( which clearly needs to be followed by further experimental and numerical investigations ) the authors hope to increase awareness within the community of the fact that the velocity field , and thus , horizontal _ mixing _ can vary in such a nontrivial way with @xmath15 .",
    "this may be of interest in ocean dynamics , where horizontal ( e.g. meridional ) temperature difference and vertical salinity gradients co - exist .",

    "<S> a water - filled differentially heated rotating annulus with initially prepared stable vertical salinity profiles is studied in the laboratory . </S>",

    "<S> we find that , although the presence of stable stratification generally hinders full - depth overturning , double - diffusive convection can yield development of multicellular sideways convection in shallow layers and subsequently to a multilayered baroclinic instability . therefore we conclude that by decreasing the characteristic vertical scale of the flow , stratification may even enhance the formation of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies ( and thus , mixing ) in a local sense . </S>"
