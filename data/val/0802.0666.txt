    "let @xmath0 be a nonconstant , nonlinear entire or meromorphic function .",
    "the existence of _ invariant line fields _ ( see section [ sec : linefields ] ) supported on the julia set of @xmath2 is an important question which is related to _ density of hyperbolicity _ , one of the central problems in one - dimensional real and holomorphic dynamics .",
    "it is conjectured that _ flexible latts maps _",
    "( see @xcite ) are the only rational functions for which such line fields exist .    in the setting of transcendental meromorphic functions @xmath0 ,",
    "the situation is less clear .",
    "indeed , it is known @xcite that there exist `` pathological '' entire transcendental functions that support invariant line fields on their julia sets . also , hyperbolicity  even structural stability  need not be dense in parameter spaces of entire transcendental functions if the set @xmath3 of _ singular values _ of @xmath2 ( that is , the closure of the set @xmath4 of critical and asymptotic values ) is too large .",
    "( we explicitly note that we include @xmath5 in @xmath6 if it is a critical or asymptotic value .",
    "often @xmath6 denotes only the _ finite _ singular values of @xmath2 , but for the purposes of this article our convention is more convenient . ) it is not even clear how `` hyperbolicity '' should be defined when @xmath7 is unbounded .",
    "however , it is expected that such phenomena can be controlled when the functions in question are sufficiently tame , either function - theoretically or dynamically . for example , we believe that hyperbolicity is dense in the parameter spaces @xmath8 of entire functions with finitely many singular values that were defined in @xcite .    in this article , we will , on the other hand , prove the absence of invariant line fields for meromorphic functions under some strong dynamical conditions , but without making many function - theoretic assumptions .",
    "let us say that @xmath2 is _ nonrecurrent _ if the finite part @xmath1 of the postsingular set @xmath9 is bounded , and furthermore every critical point @xmath10 of @xmath2 is nonrecurrent ; i.e. @xmath11 .",
    "[ thm : nonrecurrent ] let @xmath0 be a nonlinear and nonconstant meromorphic function .",
    "suppose that @xmath2 is nonrecurrent and has no wandering domains , and that there is a bound on the order of all pre - poles of @xmath2 .",
    "then the julia set of @xmath2 supports no invariant line fields .",
    "if @xmath2 as in the statement of the theorem had a wandering domain , then the set of limit points of the iterates on this domain would have to be bounded .",
    "it is an open question whether an entire or meromorphic function can have a wandering domain with this property ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem 2.87 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* question 8) ) .",
    "we also remark that the assumption on wandering domains in theorem [ thm : nonrecurrent ] can be weakened somewhat .",
    "e.g.  it is enough to assume that the grand orbit of every wandering domain contains at most one singular orbit ( see theorem [ thm : nonrecurrent2 ] for details ) .",
    "there are two main ingredients in the proof of this theorem .",
    "the first is a generalization of ma s theorem @xcite regarding pullbacks of disks that are disjoint from the @xmath12-limit sets of recurrent critical values . in particular , we prove the following .",
    "[ thm : manemain ] let @xmath0 be a nonlinear and nonconstant meromorphic function , and suppose that @xmath13 is bounded .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath14 be a compact subset of the julia set @xmath15 with the following properties :    1 .",
    "@xmath16 is forward - invariant , i.e.  @xmath17 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath16 contains neither critical points nor parabolic periodic points ; 3 .   @xmath16 does not intersect the @xmath12-limit set of any recurrent critical points , or of any singular values contained in wandering domains .",
    "then @xmath16 is a hyperbolic set .",
    "recall that a _ hyperbolic set _ is a compact , forward invariant set @xmath14 such that , for some @xmath18 and some @xmath19 , we have @xmath20 for all @xmath21 .",
    "it is clearly necessary to make some restrictions about unbounded singular orbits ; consider e.g.  the case of an entire function that has a non - linearizable irrationally indifferent fixed point but no critical points .",
    "however , the assumption that @xmath13 is bounded is stronger that what we need ; we use it merely for convenience of statement . compare theorem [ thm : maneexplicit ] .    the second main result concerns the absence of invariant line fields for a large class of `` dynamically tame '' transcendental meromorphic functions .",
    "this theorem generalizes a result of mcmullen ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.17 ) .",
    "it will be used in a subsequent paper @xcite to establish density of hyperbolicity in parameter spaces of certain _ real _ entire transcendental functions with finitely many singular values .",
    "( this is the original motivation behind our study . )    to state the result .",
    "let us say that @xmath2 is _ measurably transitive _ if the radial julia set @xmath22 ( see section [ sec : ergodic ] ) has positive measure .",
    "roughly speaking , this means that it is possible to pass from small scales to large scales by a univalent iterate near any point in @xmath23 , which is a natural hypothesis in our setting .",
    "if @xmath2 is measurably transitive , then @xmath24 and @xmath2 is ergodic on the julia set ; see theorem [ thm : ergodic ] below .",
    "we note that all functions with @xmath25 for a positive measure set of @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 denotes spherical distance ) are measurably transitive .",
    "[ thm : mainlinefields ] let @xmath0 be a nonconstant , nonlinear meromorphic function .",
    "suppose that @xmath2 is measurably transitive , and that @xmath2 is not a latts map .",
    "then @xmath2 supports no invariant line field on its julia set .",
    "using theorem [ thm : manemain ] and a result of bock @xcite ( see theorem [ thm : ergodic ] ) , it follows that a function satisfying the hypotheses of theorem [ thm : nonrecurrent ] either is measurably transitive , or almost every orbit accumulates at @xmath5 .",
    "hence theorem [ thm : nonrecurrent ] will be proved in section [ sec : proofs ] by showing that the latter set ( and , in particular , the set of _ escaping points _ , which converge to infinity under iteration ) also does not support invariant line fields .",
    "graczyk , kotus and witek @xcite proved theorem [ thm : manemain ] under the additional assumptions that @xmath28 contains no critical points and that @xmath24 .",
    "they also proved theorem [ thm : nonrecurrent ] for such functions , assuming that @xmath29 as well as an additional technical condition .",
    "our proof of theorem [ thm : manemain ] follows quite closely the account of ma s theorem given by tan lei and shishikura @xcite , although additional care is required to deal with the transcendental case .",
    "likewise , the proof of theorem [ thm : mainlinefields ] follows mcmullen s general strategy , but contains also some other ingredients : we use nevanlinna s theorem on completely branched values , and also need to develop an argument to deal with the singularity at infinity for a transcendental meromorphic function .",
    "martin and mayer @xcite have given an alternative proof of theorem [ thm : mainlinefields ] for rational functions that can also be applied to transcendental entire functions .",
    "this argument is extended in @xcite to give an alternative proof of theorem  [ thm : mainlinefields ] that also applies to epstein s more general class of `` ahlfors islands maps '' .",
    "we should mention that there are a number of other results regarding the absence of invariant line fields for transcendental entire and meromorphic functions which go in a somewhat different direction .",
    "in particular , in @xcite , the absence of invariant line fields is shown for exponential maps that satisfy a type of collet - eckmann condition .",
    "the article @xcite establishes that an invariant line field for any meromorphic function can not be supported on the set of points that escape to infinity through logarithmic singularities .",
    "( this result will be used in the proof of theorem [ thm : nonrecurrent ] above . )",
    "also , our version of ma s theorem has connections to kisaka s study @xcite of _ semi - hyperbolicity _ ( which requires that _ all _ pullbacks of sufficiently small disks have only a bounded amount of branching , which e.g.  excludes the existence of asymptotic values ) ; see also @xcite .",
    "okuyama ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.1 ) has a certain version of ma s theorem for functions with finitely many critical points and asymptotic values , while kotus and urbaski @xcite have previously treated the case of elliptic functions .",
    "we begin by proving our version of ma s theorem in section [ sec : mane ] .",
    "sections [ sec : ergodic ] to [ sec : exceptional ] discuss material that is not entirely new , but for which we know of no reference that presents it as we require .",
    "more precisely , section [ sec : ergodic ] discusses radial julia sets for general transcendental entire or meromorphic functions , which are important in the study of measurable dynamics of such functions .",
    "we also prove two basic results regarding these sets .",
    "section [ sec : linefields ] reviews facts about ( univalent ) line fields . in section [ sec : exceptional ] , we introduce and discuss the concept of `` branched exceptional '' values , which may be of independent interest and does not seem to appear explicitly in the literature . the main work for theorem [ thm : mainlinefields ] is done in section [ sec : univalent ] , where we classify all meromorphic functions that support univalent line fields near their julia sets .",
    "we remark that the discussion of ma s theorem and radial julia sets in sections [ sec : mane ] and [ sec : ergodic ] , on the one hand , and of invariant line fields in sections [ sec : linefields ] to [ sec : univalent ] , on the other , can be read quite independently from each other . finally , we tie up the loose strings in section [ sec : proofs ] .      we denote the complex plane by @xmath23 and the riemann sphere by @xmath30 .",
    "we use a number of different notions of distance in this article : euclidean distance is denoted @xmath31 , spherical distance is denoted @xmath27 , and hyperbolic distance in some open set @xmath32 is denoted @xmath33 .",
    "we use the analogous notation for diameters ; e.g.  @xmath34 denotes the diameter of @xmath35 in the hyperbolic metric of @xmath36 .",
    "the euclidean disk of radius @xmath37 around @xmath38 is denoted @xmath39 , while the corresponding spherical disk is @xmath40 .    throughout this article @xmath0",
    "will be a nonconstant , nonlinear meromorphic function , unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "as usual , the julia and fatou sets of @xmath2 are denoted by @xmath15 and @xmath41 , respectively . if @xmath42 and @xmath43 with @xmath44 , then the _ pullback _ of @xmath36 along the orbit of @xmath38 is the component @xmath45 of @xmath46 containing @xmath38 .",
    "this pullback is called _ univalent _ if @xmath47 is univalent .",
    "@xmath12-limit set _ of a point @xmath42 is the accumulation set of the forward orbit of @xmath38 under @xmath2 .",
    "we frequently deal with open covers of a compact set @xmath48 .",
    "the _ lebesgue covering number _ of such a covering is the largest number @xmath49 such that the disk of radius @xmath49 around any point of @xmath16 is contained in some element of the open cover in question ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 26 ) .",
    "we use the following notation to conclude proofs and results : @xmath50 denotes the end of a proof , @xmath51 indicates a result cited without proof , and @xmath52 completes the proof of an auxiliary step within a larger argument .",
    "we thank walter bergweiler , adam epstein , janina kotus , volker mayer , phil rippon and mariusz urbaski for interesting discussions .",
    "in this section , we do the main work for the proof of theorem [ thm : manemain ] .",
    "more precisely , we establish the `` point version '' of this theorem ( theorem [ thm : manegeneral ] ) . in the rational case , this states that a sufficiently small disk around any point of the compact set @xmath16 can be pulled back along arbitrary backwards orbits with only a bounded amount of branching .",
    "the `` compact set version '' of our theorem , stated in the introduction , is deduced from the point version in the following section , as a special case of an observation about radial julia sets .    to motivate what follows ,",
    "we recall that the proof of ma s theorem essentially relies on the following two principles ( compare ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemmas 1 and 2 ) ) .    1 .",
    "suppose we are given a sequence @xmath53 of pullbacks of a disk @xmath54 intersecting the julia set but not intersecting any recurrent critical orbits .",
    "suppose furthermore that the @xmath55 are `` small '' for @xmath56 .",
    "then this pullback passes through every non - recurrent critical point at most once , and hence the degree of such a pullback is at most the product over the degrees of non - recurrent critical points . 2",
    ".   if a larger disk @xmath57 can be pulled back along the same orbit as @xmath54 with a bounded amount of branching , then the pullback of @xmath54 will be `` small '' .",
    "in the rational case , both these facts are true for any reasonable meaning of the word `` small '' , e.g.  in the spherical metric , but in the transcendental case , where the domain of definition of @xmath2 is noncompact , things are more complicated .",
    "for example , if we interpret `` small '' in the euclidean metric , then there is no reason for ( ii ) to be true , and indeed it can be checked that ( ii ) fails e.g.  for the functions @xmath58 .",
    "( consider preimages of a disk @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is sufficiently small . ) on the other hand , with respect to the spherical metric , there are a number of reasons for ( i ) to fail , for example if the pullback passes through transcendental singularities , critical points of arbitrarily high period , etc .",
    "one might think that it is not necessary to consider unbounded pullbacks if we are only interested in bounded backward orbits . however , this is not true .",
    "it is useful to keep in mind the case of an exponential map @xmath61 with a bounded siegel disk @xmath36 . in this case",
    ", @xmath62 is a compact , forward invariant set , but @xmath16 is not a hyperbolic set .",
    "hence any proof of ma s theorem will break down in this case , precisely because it may become necessary to follow pullbacks along the ( unbounded ) singular orbit .",
    "in fact , our results imply that the singular value is recurrent in this setting ; compare corollary [ cor : certainsiegel ] below .",
    "the main insight we need in order to deal with these issues effectively is due to tan lei and shishikura @xcite : they interpret `` small '' above as having bounded diameter in the hyperbolic metric of some suitable backwards - invariant open set @xmath63 .",
    "then ( ii ) is immediate ( see lemma [ lem : diam ] ) , and ( i ) can be dealt with ( given suitable hypotheses ) by only considering pullbacks that follow the postsingular set , as in the following definition .",
    "[ defn : regularity ] we say that a point @xmath64 is _ regular _ if there are @xmath65 and @xmath66 with the following property : if @xmath67 and @xmath36 is a connected component of @xmath68 with @xmath69 , then @xmath36 is simply connected and @xmath70 is a branched covering of degree at most @xmath71 .",
    "( if we want to be more specific , we also say that @xmath72 is _",
    "@xmath71-regular_. )    this differs from the definition of regularity in @xcite , where it was required that the map is univalent ; i.e. @xmath73 .",
    "our goal now is to prove regularity of @xmath72 under suitable assumptions ( e.g. , when @xmath72 belongs to a set @xmath16 as in the statement of theorem [ thm : manemain ] ) . we follow the ideas of @xcite quite closely ,",
    "although our presentation differs somewhat .",
    "in particular , we use the following simple lemma from @xcite .    [",
    "lem : diam ] let @xmath74 , and let @xmath75 .",
    "then there is a constant @xmath76 with the following property .",

    "as @xmath81 for fixed @xmath79 , the constant @xmath76 also tends to @xmath82 .      to clarify the structure of the proof , we begin by stating explicitly the hypotheses on the domain @xmath63 that are needed in the proof ( essentially , these are the requirements to make ( i ) above work ; the reader will quickly recognize ( * ) below as a type of nonrecurrence condition )",
    "we then deduce a version of ma s theorem under these assumptions .",
    "afterwards , we formulate some explicit situations in which our setup applies . for",
