    "due to the exciting perspective of magnetoelectronics where coherent charge and polarized spin are both utilized for electronic device functions@xcite , quantum transport properties of systems with a magnetic character have attracted extensive attention .",
    "the well known giant magnetoresistance effect ( gmr ) is such a spin - polarized electronic transport effect@xcite , using which a gmr device changes its resistance depending on the orientation of magnetic moments of the magnetic multi - layers forming the device .",
    "a gmr system is fabricated by sandwiching non - magnetic metal layer between two magnetic layers@xcite , and further extensions or variations of this structure can produce many other device functions , including the spin - valve transistor@xcite , spin selective electron interferometer@xcite , and nonvolatile ram@xcite . while gmr is perhaps one of the most fruitful areas of fundamental research which has already produced substantial application with huge commercial value , an entirely different approach , also exploiting spin - polarized transport ,",
    "is the tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) where an insulating ( i ) material layer is sandwiched in between two ferromagnetic ( fm ) layers@xcite , forming a @xmath1 structure .",
    "one important attraction of a tmr device is that it carries lower current than the metallic gmr system , hence tmr can be , in principle , more advantageous for portable devices . due to the reported room temperature operation of tmr@xcite ,",
    "the fundamental principle and various transport characteristics of tmr devices have been the subject of increasingly more research , and will be the topic of the present work .",
    "tunneling of spin - polarized electrons through the tmr structure gives a large tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) through the spin - valve effect@xcite .",
    "the spin valve effect is characterized by the fractional change of resistance @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the difference in resistance when magnetization of the two ferromagnetic metals are in parallel or anti - parallel . in the original experiment of julliere on @xmath4 ,",
    "@xmath5 was determined to be about @xmath6 at @xmath7k temperature at zero external bias voltage , and it dropped to @xmath8 when bias was increased to a few mev .",
    "more recently , large tmr was reported@xcite to persist at room temperature where @xmath5 is about @xmath9 for @xmath10 at small bias .",
    "again , in this device @xmath5 decreases drastically when the voltage increases@xcite .",
    "these experimental results clearly point to the need of a thorough theoretical understanding of the bias as well as temperature dependence of tmr . on the theoretical side",
    ", tmr has been investigated by many authors .",
    "zhang _ et.al .",
    "_ have considered@xcite tmr using a transfer matrix and calculated the tunnel conductance and magnetoresistance of a fm / i / fm system with an oscillatory but decaying bias voltage dependence of tmr resulting from quantum resonance .",
    "bratkovsky@xcite investigated a similar system and compared cases with or without impurity scattering .",
    "barna and fert investigated magnetoresistance oscillations due to charging effects@xcite ; zhang _",
    "et.al._@xcite investigated the zero - bias anomaly of the experimental data@xcite and provided an explanation that the anomaly is due to localized spin excitations at the barrier - electrode interface ; and a number of studies@xcite were devoted to improve the original tmr model of julliere@xcite .",
    "very recently , the nonlinear bias dependence of an interesting tmr device in the form of @xmath11 was investigated theoretically@xcite . due to the relative magnetic moment orientation of the three fm layers as well as the quantum well formed by the two insulating layers , various very interesting tmr behavior can be expected@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to further investigate tmr effect as a function of external bias as well as temperature in a @xmath1 device structure , where we pay special attention to the internal coulomb potential due to interactions .",
    "for a quantum device subjected to an external bias voltage , the internal potential build - up can be an important factor determining transport characteristics at the nonlinear regime@xcite , and this has not been included in previous analysis ref . of the bias dependence of tmr . there , external bias potentials are included non - self - consistently through fermi functions of the electron reservoirs . in this paper",
    "we present a theory for tmr junctions based on the nonequilibrium green s function , where the internal potential is solved self - consistently at the hartree level .",
    "in particular we derive a general expression for the electric current flowing through the tmr device in terms of external bias , temperature , and the angle @xmath0 between the magnetic moments of the two fm electrodes . due to the inclusion of the internal coulomb potential into the theory , the predicted results are gauge invariant against the shift of the external bias  which is a fundamental requirement of any transport theory . in the wideband limit and",
    "applying the charging model for the internal potential , we further derive an analytic expression of angular dependence of the i - v curve at zero temperature .",
    "the temperature dependence of tmr is then studied via a numerical integration of our analytical formula .",
    "finally , in the weakly nonlinear regime our theory allows predictions of the slope of the tmr near zero bias , where experiments@xcite showed a dip of magneto - conductance at low temperatures .",
    "our results showed that the slope smoothly crosses over from a finite value at low temperature to zero at high temperature .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the general theory by deriving a current expression for tmr junctions . in section iii , we apply this current expression for various situations , and a summary is given in section iv .",
    "the tmr device we examine is schematically shown in the inset of fig .",

    "but the qualitative trend of these results are consistent . the tmr minimum in fig .",
    "( 3 ) is due to quantum resonance , as was also seen in previous studies@xcite .",
    "finally , we note that experimental data of tmr as a function of bias is a slight concave - shaped curve near zero bias , but that of our model , as well as of others@xcite , are slightly convex .",
    "thus the decay rate of tmr is faster in the measured data@xcite , which indicates that other physical mechanisms@xcite absent in the present model are perhaps needed to quantitatively understand the experimental data .",
    "experimental results on tmr junctions of ref . showed that there is a clear conductance dip at zero bias at low temperature , a slight dip at intermediate temperature , and perhaps no dip at high temperature .",

    "<S> we present a theoretical analysis of the nonlinear bias and temperature dependence of current - voltage characteristics of a spin - valve device which is formed by connecting a quantum dot to two ferromagnetic electrodes whose magnetic moments orient at an angle @xmath0 with respect to each other . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is based on nonequilibrium green s function approach and focused on current perpendicular to plane geometry . </S>",
    "<S> coulomb interaction has been taken into account explicitly at the hartree level . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a formula in closed form for current flowing through the device in general terms of bias and temperature . in the wideband limit </S>",
    "<S> we report exact results for the tmr junction nonlinear i - v curve as a function of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we also report the conductance slope at zero bias as a function of temperature for which experimental results reported an anomalous behavior . </S>"
