    "( 2006 ) found that the extended x - ray emission observed by chandra along the lobes of three powerful , high - redshift radio galaxies 3c 432 , 3c 294 and 3c 191 is likely due to inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons by the relativistic electrons confined in the lobes .",
    "this is consistent with previous findings of x - ray emission from the lobes of fr - ii radio galaxies ( like 3c223 and 3c284 , see croston et al .",

    "only if relativistic beaming effects are important , the jets will dominate the synchrotron and/or inverse - compton emission on kpc scales . on the contrary ,",
    "it is clear that relativistic beaming is never important in extended radio lobes .",
    "detailed studies of the ics x - ray emission provide constraints to the energetics of the electron population in the lobes . specifically , a lower limit on the electron energy in the lobe , which is of order of a few times @xmath1 erg , has been derived for relativistic electrons that have an energy cutoff @xmath2 ( see , e.g. , erlund et al .",

    "under the assumption that the x - ray emission from radio - galaxy lobes is due to ics of cmb photons , a simple energy argument yields a value of the minimum electron energy @xmath5 that corresponds to @xmath6 in order to be detected by chandra in the energy range @xmath7 kev .",

    "steeper power - law electron spectra produce larger sze amplitudes at low values of @xmath115 ( for a fixed frequency ) because they yield larger total energy / pressure and optical depth for the electronic population and hence a larger amount of cmb photon scattering off the non - thermal electrons residing in the lobes .",
    "possible sources of confusion and contamination for the observation of the non - thermal sze in radio - galaxy lobes are the high - frequency tail of the synchrotron radio emission from the lobes and cmb primary anisotropies on angular scales comparable with the radio lobe size .    if the energy spectra of 3c294 and 3c432 extend down to @xmath118 gev , or even lower energies , the expected sze at @xmath119 ghz from the lobes of these sources are @xmath120 @xmath13k for 3c432 and @xmath19 @xmath13k for 3c294 ( see figs .",

    "2006 ) and we extrapolated their contribution to 200 ghz , i.e. the frequency region where the contribution of the synchrotron spectra is minimum ( see figs.[fig.sz_3c432_dt ] and [ fig.sz_3c294_dt ] ) .",
    "+ the level of synchrotron contamination depends in fact on the brightness level of the radio lobes and it is more enhanced in the central part of the lobes rather than in their external sides .",
    "for 3c294 we found that the highest brightness level of 600 mjy / beam at 1.425 ghz , found in the inner part of the lobes , with an energy spectral slope of @xmath123 ( corresponding to a synchrotron radio slope of @xmath124 ) produces a brightness of @xmath125 2.88 mjy / beam at 200 ghz .",
    "this yields a cmb temperature brightness of @xmath126 @xmath13k in a 5 arcsec beam .",
    "such high level of contamination renders extremely difficult to detect the sze produced in the lobes of 3c294 unless @xmath115 reaches very low values @xmath127 mev ( see fig.[fig.dt_emin_3c294 ] ) .",
    "+ however , the absolute amplitude of the non - thermal sze is higher than the synchrotron brightness in the outer parts of the lobe , where the radio brightness drops down to levels of @xmath128 mjy / beam ( see fig.[fig.dt_emin_3c294 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that such observational evidence implies ( as already noticed by hardcastle & croston 2005 ) that either the magnetic field strength or the electron spectrum can not remain constant throughout the radio - galaxy lobes .",
    "the case in which the magnetic field strength decreases throughout the lobe maximizes the chance of detection of the associated sze .",
    "however , also models in which both the magnetic field is somewhat weaker and the electron spectrum is more depleted of high - energy electrons as a function of the distance from the inner jet ( a favoured model for the lobes of pictor a , see hardcastle & croston 2005 ) tend to favour the detectability of the non - thermal sze in the outer lobe regions because such sze effect is mainly sensitive to the low - energy part of the electron spectrum which is likely not varying much with the distance from the inner jet . therefore , under the assumption that the electron spectrum does not depend on the position within the lobe and the magnetic field strength decreases throughout the lobe , the outer parts of the radio lobes of this source are the optimal regions to detect the non - thermal sze and therefore to set constraints to the value of @xmath115 and to the overall energetics of the lobe .    for 3c432 ,",
    "the highest brightness level of 144 mjy / beam at 1.54 ghz , found in the central part of the radio lobes , with an energy spectral slope of @xmath129 ( corresponding to a synchrotron radio slope of @xmath130 ) produces a brightness of @xmath125 9 mjy / beam at 200 ghz .",

    "such high level of contamination renders impossible to detect the sze produced in the lobes of 3c432 even for values of @xmath132 mev ( see fig.[fig.dt_emin_3c432 ] ) .",
    "the absolute amplitude of the non - thermal sze in the radio lobes of this source are always lower than the synchrotron brightness in the outer parts of the lobe ( even in the optimal case in which the magnetic field strength decreases throughout the lobe ) , except than at the outer boundaries of the radio lobes , where the radio brightness drops down to levels of @xmath133 mjy / beam , providing a cmb temperature brightness of @xmath134 @xmath13k ( see fig.[fig.dt_emin_3c432 ] ) .",
    "it would be , nonetheless , rather arduous to detect this feeble signal due to both the low signal - to - noise ratio and to the long ( @xmath135 year ) exposure required for alma .",
    "the different behaviour of the contamination of the two sources depends mainly on the different synchrotron spectra here assumed , which render flat synchrotron spectra extrapolated at microwave wavelengths more contaminating for the sze measurements than steep synchrotron spectra radio lobes . for the same reason , the lobes of 3c294 , for which a steeper electron spectrum is indicated by the ic x - ray data , produce a larger amount of sze signal for the case of low values of @xmath115 because most of the comptonization of the cmb radiation is produced by low - energy electrons .",
    "it seems , therefore , that steep - spectra radio lobes are the best cases to detect the non - thermal sze expected in the extended lobes which are likely the sites of ic x - ray emission .    in the previous estimates",
    ", we have assumed that the same electron spectrum producing the x - ray ic emission is also holding for the more energetic electrons producing radio synchrotron emission , and we have further calculated the contribution of the synchrotron emission by extrapolating such a spectrum from low ( @xmath136 ghz ) radio frequencies up to microwave ( @xmath137 ghz ) frequencies . such a power - law extrapolation to 200 ghz likely maximizes the level of synchrotron contamination to the sze signal in the case in which there is , instead , a break in the radio lobe spectrum at intermediate ( @xmath138 ghz ) frequencies .",
    "preliminary exploration at high frequencies ( see e.g. looney & hardcastle 2000 ; hardcastle & looney 2001 ) indicates that radio lobes can still emit at 100 ghz ( in the source rest frame , which is not really comparable to the 300 ghz source frame for the @xmath139 radio galaxies considered here ) .",
    "it can be argumented - on general grounds - that , in the absence of an efficient and continuous particle ( re-)acceleration mechanism acting in the lobes , synchrotron and inverse - compton losses will rapidly deplete particles capable of radiating at these high frequencies . for equipartition field strengths of @xmath140 a few @xmath13 g ,",
    "the break frequency due to loss processes is likely found below @xmath141 ghz after @xmath142 myr from the electron injection event ( see discussion by leahy 1991 ) .",
    "therefore , for electrons older than this age , the extrapolation from low radio frequencies up to @xmath137 ghz will certainly overpredict the level of synchrotron emission and of its contamination to the sze signal",
    ". + spatially resolved spectroscopic observations of radio lobes at microwave frequencies ( @xmath143 ghz ) will be definitely able to set constraints on the existence and frequency location of the possible break of the radio synchrotron emission and , hence , on models of the particle re - acceleration in these cosmic environments . in the context of this explorative study aimed to detect the non - thermal sze from the radio lobes , it is instructive to notice that it is possible to set some constraints on the slope and on the frequency of the synchrotron break from the requirement to have little or no contamination of the sze signal by radio emission from the lobe .",
    "assuming , for simplicity , that the synchrotron radio spectrum is given by a double power - law , @xmath144 up to the break frequency @xmath145 and by a steeper spectrum @xmath146 at @xmath147 , it is possible to show that the slope @xmath148 required in order to have a negligible contamination of the lobe synchrotron emission to the sze diffuse flux @xmath149 at frequency @xmath150 is > _ r + , [ eq.beta ] which cen be estimated in terms of measurable quantities @xmath151 and @xmath145 .",
    "+ nonetheless , it is clear that there will still likely be emission from regions with ongoing particle acceleration ( like , e.g. , the inner jets and the hotspots of radio galaxies ) which might even substantially contaminate the sze signal .",
    "these regions are , however , spatially localized in the central parts of the extended lobes and certainly not contaminating the outer regions of the lobes of a typical radio galaxy like 3c294 , i.e. the regions where there is the maximum probability to detect the non - thermal sze signal .    finally , it should be noticed that  beyond the substantial contamination level of the high - frequency tail of the synchrotron emission from the radio lobes  a multi - frequency analysis of both the synchrotron and sze signals ( which have quite different spectra in the microwave band , see figs .",
    "[ fig.sz_3c432_dt ] and [ fig.sz_3c294_dt ] ) could greatly help in subtracting the synchrotron signal from the sze maps of radio lobes , even in the case of strongly contaminated sources like 3c432 .",
    "the other source of contamination , i.e. , the rms value of the primary cmb anisotropy ( predicted in the viable @xmath152cdm cosmological model ) on a 5 arcsec angular scale is of the order of @xmath153 @xmath13k and it is therefore a marginal contribution ( at most ) to the sze from the radio lobes in the two sources here considered .",
    "in addition , contamination from cmb anisotropies to the sze from the radio lobes would appear as a constant level bias in figs.[fig.sz_3c294_dt ] and [ fig.sz_3c432_dt ] .",
    "therefore , a multifrequency analysis at microwave frequencies could clearly separate the cmb anisotropy contamination ( having a flat spectrum in the @xmath154 plot ) from the sze ( having a specific non - flat spectrum in the same plot ) .",
    "+ we conclude that detection of the sze from high-@xmath155 radio lobes is possible with the next generation high - sensitivity , high - resolution experiments ( like alma ) if the electron spectrum extends down to sufficiently low energies .",
    "upper limits to the lobe sze will provide a low energy limit on the electron spectrum which is by far more constraining than the limit set by the available x - ray observations .",
    "similar observations can also be made in nearby radio - galaxies with the spt instrument that has a more moderate ( @xmath156 arcsec - 1 arcmin resolution ) but similar ( @xmath0k ) sensitivity .",
    "the spatial observation of the sze from radio - galaxy lobes has relevant astrophysical and cosmological implications .",
    "we stress that the constraints on @xmath4 obtainable from sze observations are much more reliable than those obtained from x - ray ic emission , because the sze depends on the total pressure / energy density ( that depends on the true @xmath4 ) of the electronic population along the los through the lobe , while the ic x - ray emission can only provide an estimate of the electron energetics , and hence of @xmath4 , in the high - energy part of the electron spectrum , namely at energies larger than @xmath5 , where @xmath157 is the lower energy threshold of the x - ray detector ( see discussion in sect.1 above ) .",
    "the conclusions of blundell et al .",
    "( 2006 ) on the discovery of a low energy cutoff in powerful giant radio galaxies should , therefore , be rephrased in the previous framework .",
    "these authors found , indeed , only that value of @xmath158 consistent with the lower energy threshold ( @xmath135 kev ) of their x - ray analysis of the radio - galaxy 4c39.24 ( the previous value is of the same order of that found by erlund et al .",
    "2006 , being in fact obtained with the same x - ray instrument ) .",
    "sze observations of the lobes of this source should provide much more reliable estimates of @xmath4 and hence of the relative value of @xmath4 in the compact radio galaxy hotspots , where the energetic electrons have been likely originated .",
    "+ as a consequence , also the scaling for the equipartition magnetic field , @xmath159 with @xmath160 ( see blundell et al .",
    "2006 ) should be reconsidered : lower values of @xmath4 consistent with the total pressure / energy estimate in lobes , as likely provided by sze observations , would indicate higher values of @xmath161 in the radio lobes .",
    "estimates of the overall b - field in the lobe by co - spatial ic x - ray and radio synchrotron emission , @xmath162 , strongly depend on the assumption that the vast majority of x - ray emission is provided by ics of cmb photons ( a similar assumption is usually done for estimates of wide - scale b - field in galaxy clusters , see discussion by colafrancesco et al .",
    "partial contamination of the lobe x - ray emission by other emission processes would , therefore , lower the value of @xmath163 and in turn increase the estimate of the overall b - field in the lobe .",
    "+ in this context , it is interesting to notice that a better estimate of the overall b - field in the lobe through this technique could be obtained by using the ratio @xmath164 , where the sze signal is a much safer messenger of the cmb energy density which is reprocessed by all the possible compton scatterings induced by the full electron population in the radio - galaxy lobes .",
    "in addition , the spatially resolved study of the sze and of the synchrotron emission in the lobes of radio - galaxies like 3c294 could provide interesting indication on the radial behaviour of the magnetic field in these radio lobes . +",
    "a corollary of the previous considerations is that sze signals are crucial to constrain the lobe pressure and energetics , at least of the leptonic component , and to map the leptonic pressure from the inner lobe regions out to lobe boundaries .",
    "+ the study of the pressure evolution in radio lobes can also provide crucial indications on the transition from radio lobe environments to the atmospheres of giant cavities observed in galaxy cluster atmospheres ( see , e.g. , mcnamara & nulsen 2007 for a review ) , which seem naturally related to the penetration of radio - galaxy jets / lobes into the intra - cluster medium ( see , e.g. , the extreme case of the giant cavities in the cluster ms0735.6 + 7421 ) .",
    "previous studies of the spatial and spectral features of the sze in giant intracluster cavities ( colafrancesco 2005 ) will be naturally connected to the developments of this preliminary study of the sze for radio - galaxy lobes .",
    "the development of experimental technology in microwave polarization will hopefully provide the possibility to detect sze polarization signals from radio - galaxy lobes and allow the possibility to build a full 3-d tomography of radio lobes .",
    "we finally stress that , under the hypothesis that the x - ray emission and the sze from the radio - galaxy lobes are produced by the same spatially - diffuse electronic population and by the same mechanism ( i.e. ics of cmb photons ) , the x - ray and the sze brightness have to be co - spatial . if the sze along the los to the lobe is not found to be coincident with the relative ic x - ray emission , then the nature of the lobe should be different from that of a diffuse leptonic plasma , and its x - ray emission should be produced by a different mechanism .    to conclude this discussion , we outline here a few cosmological implications of the sze detectable from radio - galaxy lobes . if the sze and the ic x - ray flux of the lobes are produced by the same electronic population , the ratio @xmath165   { m_e c^2 \\over a } { 1 \\over c k_b } \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\times { ( hc)^3 \\over ( k_b t_{cmb})^3 }    { 1 \\over i(t ) }   { \\alpha + 1 \\over \\alpha -1 }   { \\gamma_{min}^{-(\\alpha-1 ) } \\over ( { \\delta e_{\\gamma } \\over a})^{-{(\\alpha -1 ) \\over 2 } }   }   \\label{eq.dtfluxratio }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] between the sze temperature decrement @xmath166 and the x - ray ic flux @xmath167 integrated in the energy band @xmath55 ( see eqs.[eq.deltai ] , [ eq.y ] , [ eq.deltat ] , [ eq : icflux ] and [ eq : icemiss_explicit ] ) provides an estimate of @xmath62 at the radio - galaxy redshift in terms of measurable quantities and fundamental constants .",
    "in other words , the ratio @xmath168 provides an operative way to test the evolution of the cmb temperature with redshift . for a specific lobe source like 3c294 , eq.([eq.dtfluxratio ] ) provides the scaling @xmath169 } \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq.dtlicratio }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "we have shown in this paper that detailed predictions for the sze from radio - galaxy lobes can be obtained taking advantage of the constraints set on the energy / pressure by the available x - ray observations .",
    "the chandra data for the lobes of 3c294 indicate that the associated sze should be visible by the next generation sz experiments with @xmath140 arcsec and @xmath0k sensitivity , if its electron spectrum extends to quite low energies @xmath132 mev .",
    "radio galaxy lobes with much flatter spectra , like those of 3c432 , result instead swamped by the large contamination of the synchrotron emission in the same radio lobes .",
    "+ steep spectra radio lobes whose ic emission is detected in the x - ray band by chandra are the best candidates to detect the associated sze .",
    "we have also shown that the spectral information on the sze from lobes has a relevant astrophysical impact .",
    "the sze provides , in fact , information on the energetics / pressure and on the optical depth ( geometry of the lobe ) : for the simple case of a power - law spectrum , it yields information on the minimum energy of the electrons and on the minimum projected size of the lobe .",
    "the case of more complex spectra can be treated in a similar way .",
    "this information can not be provided by the ic x - ray emission limited in a finite energy band ( e.g. , @xmath170 kev ) , and hence to rather high values of @xmath2 .",
    "+ moreover , since the zero @xmath171 of the sze is moved to high frequencies depending only on the total electron pressure / energy density ( see figs.[fig.sz_3c432_dt ] and [ fig.sz_3c294_dt ] ) , its detection provides direct information on the total pressure / energy density of the electron population in the lobe .",
    "+ we outline various potential uses of the non - thermal sze detectable in radio lobes in the astrophysical and cosmological contexts : i ) constraints on the evolution of the electronic pressure in the radio lobes and the transition to the larger - scale cavities of the intra - cluster medium ; ii ) estimates of magnetic fields in lobes from a combination of radio and sze measurements , possibly obtainable with single experiments with large spectral coverage , like alma ; iii ) a full 3-d tomography of radio galaxy lobes obtainable by means of the next generation microwave polarization experiments ; iv ) a test of the evolution of the cmb temperature by using the ratio @xmath172 .",
    "these applications are still preliminary but also potentially important with the advent of the next technology .",
    "most of the non - thermal sze signal is predicted to be detectable in the outer regions of the radio - galaxy lobes , where the radio synchrotron contamination dims out .",
    "therefore , sze detectability is likely possible with instruments with arcsec spatial resolution and @xmath13k sensitivity ( like alma ) in distant sources , and with a somewhat lower resolution instruments ( like spt ) in nearby radio galaxies . +",
    "all the arguments presented in this paper show that the study of the sze from radio - galaxy lobes are highly complementary to the study of their ic x - ray emission and are also crucial for their astrophysical and cosmological relevance .",
