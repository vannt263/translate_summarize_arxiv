    "one of the major challenges of quantum computation technology is to beat decoherence , i.e. , the uncontrollable coupling of qubits to their environment .",
    "since the coupling of a small system to the environment is hard to control , topological quantum computation circumvents this problem by encoding the quantum information into global properties of a physical system and thus making it insensitive to local perturbations .",
    "several ways of implementing topological quantum computation @xcite , ranging from fractional quantum hall systems at filling @xmath0 @xcite to topological superconductors @xcite , have been proposed . in the case of topological superconductors , majorana zero modes ( mzms ) ( sometimes also simply called majorana fermions @xcite ) occur as mid - gap states localized in vortex cores of two - dimensional samples or at the ends of one - dimensional nanowires .",
    "most strikingly , these particles obey non - abelian exchange statistics , which makes them very attractive for quantum computation applications as unitary gates can be simply applied by braiding the mzms @xcite .",
    "a physical system in which mzms are expected to occur is semiconducting nanowires in proximity to a conventional superconductor in a moderate magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this system has recently attracted a lot of interest due to experimental progress in insb nanowires @xcite .    even though the main intention of topological quantum computation is to encode quantum information into global properties of the system , a readout for a topological qubit can only be executed by accessing this global information and thereby breaking the topological protection . in the context of the fractional quantum hall state , it has been suggested that the readout can be executed by interference experiments @xcite .",
    "this was later adapted to topological superconductors where the aharonov - casher effect allows to read out the majorana qubit by interfering fluxons @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been reported that it is possible to couple mzms directly to electromagnetic radiation . while some of the proposals primarily aimed at identifying the signature of mzms in microwave signals @xcite , others use the microwave coupling mechanism to implement controlled qubit manipulations @xcite . among different types of coupling mechanisms ,",

    "instead of tuning the microwave cavity on resonance , we envision a setup in the dispersive regime allowing for a quantum nondemolition measurement .",
    "as the fractional josephson radiation arises from single - electron transport due to the presence of mzms , it allows for a direct readout of the majorana qubit without involving intermediate interference steps .",

    "a prominent way to emulate a topological superconductor in order to create mzms is to employ nanowires having strong spin - orbit interaction in combination with an external magnetic field as well as proximity - induced cooper pairing @xcite . in its topological phase ,",
    "the nanowire hosts a pair of mzms at its ends .",

    "such an event changes the fermion parity on either side of the wire and thus acts like a @xmath30 on the majorana qubit .    in the following ,",

    "even though the intensity measurement in our case is better than in a typical situation without parametric driving , comparing it to the homodyne detection , we conclude that due to the additional ( large ) factor @xmath148 the homodyne detection scheme is always more efficient .",
    "as long as the external bias voltage is switched off , there is no coupling to the electromagnetic field , but nevertheless the majorana qubit as an open quantum system may suffer from uncontrollable interaction with its environment . due to a finite overlap of mzms on the nanowire , the qubit may be affected by dephasing errors @xmath149 as well as by external tunneling of quasiparticles onto the junction @xcite . the latter process is also called quasiparticle poisoning ( qp ) .",
