    "advances in electron beam lithography within the last few years have made it possible to fabricate nano sized or mesoscopic artificial structures with good control over design parameters and probe the quantum transport properties @xcite .",
    "these include very narrow quasi one - dimensional quantum wires , zero - dimensional electron systems or quantum dots , rings , etc . , constructed at a semiconductor interface . typical sizes of these systems vary between 1 to 10 @xmath1 m . at very low temperatures ( typically mk ) ,",
    "the scattering by phonons is significantly suppressed , and the phase coherence length can become large compared to the system size . in this regime the electron maintains the single particle phase coherence across the entire sample .",
    "the sample becomes an electron waveguide where the transport properties are solely determined by the impurity configuration and the geometry of the conductor and by the principles of quantum mechanics @xcite .    such advances in mesoscopic structures have led to the possibility of new quantum semiconductor devices .",
    "these active quantum devices rely on quantum effects for their operation based on interferometric principles , and are quantum analog of well - known optical and microwave devices @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of switch action by quantum interference is a new idea in electronic application .",
    "several potential switching devices have been proposed , wherein one controls the relative phase difference between different interfering paths ( say , in semiconducting loop structures ) by applying electrostatic or magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the possibility of achieving transistor action in t - shaped structure by varying the effective length of the vertical open ended lead has also been explored @xcite .",
    "devices in which electrons carry current without being scattered either elastically or inelastically ( ballistic devices ) promise to be much faster and will consume less power than the conventional devices .",
    "it should also be noted that quantum devices can exhibit multifunctional property ( e.g. , single stage frequency multiplier ) wherein the functions of an entire circuit within a single element can be performed @xcite .",
    "they can also lead to tremendous down sizing of electronic devices .",
    "the conventional transistors operate in a classical diffusive regime and are not very sensitive to variations in material parameters such as dimensions or the presence of small impurities or non - uniformity in size and shape .",
    "these devices operate by controlling the carrier density of quasi - particles",
    ". however , proposed quantum devices are not very robust in the sense that the operational characteristics depend very sensitively on material parameters , impurity configuration , shape and size , temperature and fermi energy @xcite .",
    "for example , incorporation of a single impurity in the mesoscopic device can change , non - trivially , the interference of partial electron waves propagating through the sample , and hence the electron transmission ( operational characteristics ) across the sample @xcite . in such devices",
    "the actual problem of control and reproducibility of operating thresholds becomes highly nontrivial .",

    "the incoming electrons have energy @xmath133 , the constant potential @xmath16 of the ring is such that @xmath151 . with this choice @xmath135 and @xmath136 are both imaginary .",
    "thus , we are considering in this case two evanescent modes .",
    "the solid line is @xmath111 for @xmath165 ( @xmath157 , @xmath158 ) and the dashed line is @xmath114 for @xmath166 ( @xmath167 , @xmath168 ) . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] we have considered both the channels to be evanescent with two choices of @xmath164 . here the nature of the solid curve and the dotted curve are the same as that obtained so far . we have shown in previous figures that if we use evanescent modes , conductance does not depend on the relative ratios of arm lengths and fermi energy and in this fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] we have shown that the conductance also does not depend on the total ring length of the aharonov - bohm ring .",
    "in this work we have studied two channel ( transverse modes ) aharonov - bohm ring . when we consider both the channels to be propagating",
    "then we have shown that if we change the parameters such as the total ring length , relative ratio of arm lengths , fermi energy etc .",
    ", the behavior of the conductance becomes diverse in nature in different cases .",
    "similar situation arises if we take one propagating and one evanescent modes . in presence of channel mixing the modes are not independent .",
    "resonance in the propagating channel boost up density of states in the evanescent channel and hence the evanescent channel also becomes highly conducting .",
    "such diverse behavior supports landauer s claim that switch action based on interference principle are not stable and practical .",
    "finally we have considered both the modes to be evanescent along the aharonov - bohm ring .",
    "here we have found that conductance is qualitatively as well as quantitatively same for all variations in parameters like total ring length , relative ratio of arm lengths , fermi energy etc .",
    "we can obtain appreciable changes in conductance when using evanescent modes .",
    "different channels add up coherently and so by using larger and larger number of evanescent channels we can enhance the percentage drop in conductance and hence efficiency of the switch . change in impurity configuration",
    "effectively changes the total ring length and the relative ratio of arm lengths .",
    "rise or drop in temperature effectively changes fermi energy and hence wavelength .",
    "therefore , conductance behavior will be same if we change the impurity configuration or temperature when we use evanescent modes .",
    "propagation is associated with phase changes which do not arise in case of evanescent modes . in evanescent modes ,",
    "phase changes are due to aharonov - bohm effect only .",
    "periodicity is always @xmath155 in absence of other competing source of phase changes .",
    "conductance being a symmetric function of flux is a function of @xmath169 .",
    "therefore within a period ( 0 to @xmath170 ) conductance is maximum at zero flux , then it goes through a deep minimum and rise again to a maximum value .",
    "we can assign the conductance maximum as on state and conductance minimum as off state of a switch signifying 1 and 0 operation in boolean algebra .",
    "thus we can conclude that if we employ evanescent modes only , we may be able to build stable , efficient and robust quantum switches .",
    "earlier works have proposed possibility of switch action with other geometric configurations apart from aharonov - bohm ring such as t - shaped structure @xcite etc .",
    "we may also expect that if we employ evanescent modes in other geometries , conductance will be independent of sample parameters .",
    "this is because propagation along evanescent channels are not associated with phase changes .",
    "phase changes can only be induced by external stimuli which is electrostatic potential in case of ref 5 .",
