    "the use of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) as lighthouses or `` standard candles '' for cosmological studies became feasible upon the realization of an empirical correlation of peak luminosity with light - curve shape .",
    "the discovery of the relationship between light - curve shape and brightness led to a parameterization by the decline rate @xmath4 in @xmath2-band brightness over 15 days after the maximum light ( phillips 1993 ) . the `` multi - color light curve shape '' method ( riess et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ) is based on @xmath11 , the difference in peak luminosity between an observed sn and a fiducial template .",
    "the `` stretch '' method ( perlmutter 1997 ; goldhaber et al .",
    "2001 ) parameterizes light curves with a factor @xmath12 which broadens or narrows the rest - frame timescale of a single standard template to match with observed light curves .",
    "the `` bayesian adapted template match '' method introduced by tonry et al .",
    "( 2003 ) estimates distances by comparing with a large set of well - observed nearby sne ia rather than a parameterized template .",
    "these methods are fundamentally equivalent by making use of light - curve shapes .",
    "another distance measurement technique is the cmagic method ( wang et al .",
    "2003 ) , which uses the relationship between light - curve shape and brightness in a more indirect way than the above procedures .",
    "it is based on an observed linear relationship in color - magnitude space for a certain period after the maximum light to infer distances .    besides the light - curve shape parameters , there are other parameters that have been introduced to correlate with peak luminosities of sne ia , such as line strengths of ca and si absorption lines ( nugent et al .",
    "1995 ) , the hubble types or colors of parent galaxies ( hamuy et al . 1996 ; branch et al .",
    "1996 ) , and the galactocentric distance ( wang et al . 1997 ) .",
    "these parameters as peak luminosity descriptors are somewhat difficult to quantify , especially for an sn ia at a higher redshift @xmath13 . in comparison , the color @xmath0 at the maximum light seems to serve well as another important peak luminosity descriptor , which has been justified for further reducing statistical dispersions of distance estimates when combined with decline rates ( tripp 1997 ; tripp & branch 1999 ; parodi et al .",
    "2000 ) . as to those peculiar and subluminous sne ia",
    ", the peak @xmath0 color was found to be a more effective indicator of peak luminosity than the fading rate ( e.g. , garnavich et al .",
    "the difficulty of using this color parameter is that extremely accurate photometry and reddening estimates are required , yet this situation may be mitigated for the postmaximum @xmath0 color as differences in the color curves become more conspicuous .",
    "the main thrust of this letter is to show that the @xmath0 colors of sne ia , measured @xmath14 days after the @xmath2 maximum , strongly correlate with their peak luminosities within a wide range of decline rates . with this important empirical finding",
    ", it is now possible to standardize all sne ia and use them to infer extragalactic and cosmological distances with precisions comparable to observational limits .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "1 are the @xmath0 colors and their evolution of nine well - sampled sne ia covering a broad range of observed light curve decline rates .",
    "the @xmath0 color was @xmath15 corrected and de - reddened by the galactic reddening using the full - sky maps of dust infrared emission ( schlegel et al .",
    "these sn ia events most likely suffer little or no reddening from dust in host galaxies , on the basis of certain basic criteria such as the absence of interstellar na i or ca ii lines in the spectra , morphologies of host galaxies , and the location of an sn in the host galaxy .",
    "in reference to the light curves , the evolution of color curves appears more complex and basically undergoes three stages : they become bluer from the initial detection to about 5 days before the maximum , then evolve redward by @xmath16 mag during @xmath17 weeks after the maximum , and eventually recover from the reddest color to zero when entering the nebular phase .",
    "note that the @xmath0 colors of different sne ia converge @xmath18 days after the maximum light and evolve in a similar way thereafter .",
    "this color uniformity has proven very useful as an indicator of host galaxy reddenings ( phillips et al .",
    "1999 ; hereafter p99 ) .    except for the peculiar sne ia",
    ", the color curves of normal sne ia appear to have similar shapes .",
    "their @xmath0 colors approach zero near the maximum light ( parodi et al . 2000 ) .",
    "nevertheless , a careful examination of the early phase still reveals small shifts among color curves of different sne ia .",
    "this may be attributed to reddenings in host galaxies or to intrinsic differences among sne ia ( including the mass of accreting co white dwarfs , c / o ratio , metallicity , magnetic fields , etc . ; e.g. , umeda et al .",
    "1999 ; timmes et al . 2003 ; lou 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "the prominent feature of the @xmath0 color evolution curve for those peculiar subluminous sne 1991bg , 1998de , and 1999by is their unusually red @xmath0 colors in the early phase . at the @xmath2 maximum ,",
    "the @xmath0 colors for sne 1991bg , 1998de , and 1999by are 0.69 , 0.56 , and 0.45 mag , respectively .",
    "in addition to shifts among the @xmath0 color curves of different sne ia , there are also variations in their shapes . for example , sne 1991bg and 1998de show dramatic declines and reach their reddest colors earlier than normal sne ia do , at @xmath19 days after the @xmath2 maximum , rather than at @xmath20 days for normal sne ia . closer examinations of normal sne ia reveal diverse decline rates in the color curves immediately after the @xmath2 maximum ( see fig .",
    "this diversity is apparently associated with a slower flux variation in the @xmath7 band than in the @xmath2 band for different sne ia during this phase .",
    "the @xmath0 color measured at the @xmath2 maximum is one of the most important secondary parameters used to calibrate peak luminosities of sne ia ( tripp 1997 ; tripp & branch 1999 ; parodi et al .",
    "2000 ; garnavich et al .",
    "2004 ) and even yields clues of host galaxy reddenings together with the decline rate parameter @xmath21 ( p99 ) .",
    "note that peak values of @xmath0 mostly concentrate in a range from @xmath22 to @xmath23 mag for normal sne ia .",
    "within such a narrow range , it is very difficult to precisely measure the peak @xmath0 color . as apparent in fig .",
    "1 , the @xmath0 colors @xmath14 days after the @xmath2 maximum clearly distinguish the sn ia color curves that vary from @xmath23 to @xmath24 mag for normal sne ia and extend to @xmath25 mag for peculiar events ( sn 1998de ) at this epoch .",
    "this postmaximum color not only contains the intrinsic color shift at the maximum light but also reflects , to a certain extent , the difference in light curves .",
    "we emphasize the usage of the @xmath0 color 12 days after the @xmath2 maximum , referred to as @xmath3 , as a powerful calibrator for peak luminosities of sne ia .",
    "the @xmath3 values for sne ia can be estimated directly from the photometry or from the best - fitting template .",
    "uncertainties in @xmath3 include errors in observed magnitudes , in foreground reddenings , and in the @xmath15 term .",
    "the @xmath3 `` colors '' of 84 well - observed sne ia are plotted against the decline rate parameter @xmath21 in the left panel of fig .",
    "those sne ia with light curve coverage beginning @xmath267 days after the @xmath2 maximum were excluded in our sample of sne ia , as their extrapolated maximum magnitudes , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 parameters may be inaccurate owing to larger errors .",
    "lira ( 1995 ) has shown that sne ia with low extinctions tend to have the same @xmath0 colors between 30 and 90 days after the maximum .",
    "this fact was exploited by p99 to estimate dust reddenings of sne ia in host galaxies .",
    "based on the late - time colors , we find that 38 out of 84 sne ia have values of e@xmath9 mag .",
    "we thus assume below that these sne ia were essentially unreddened by dust in their host galaxies ; their @xmath3 values approximately represent the intrinsic @xmath0 colors 12 days after the @xmath2 maximum .    as is clear in the left panel of fig .",
    "2 , an empirical correlation exists between the color parameter @xmath3 and the decline rate @xmath4 for those sne ia with e@xmath27 .",
    "this functional relation , covering the decline rates in the range of @xmath28 , appears to be monotonic and shows a rapid change or a `` kink '' in the slope near @xmath29 .",
    "a cubic spline gives a reasonable fit to the `` low - reddening '' points , with a dispersion of only 0.05 mag .",
    "the fitting parameters are listed in table 1 . despite this rapid change in slope ,",
    "the fast - declining events connect well with the end of the ` normal ' color distribution .",
    "we utilize this @xmath30 color@xmath31 relation to infer dust reddenings of sne ia in host galaxies ( p99 ) .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "2 , we show the e@xmath32 values inferred by our @xmath3 method as a function of host galaxy reddenings derived by the p99 method for a sample of 84 well - observed sne ia .",
    "a very strong correlation exists between the two reddening determinations , with no evidence for a difference in the zero points ( the weighted average of the difference amounts to @xmath33 ) .",
    "we are thus confident in using the @xmath34 relation for estimating reddenings of sne ia .",
    "the typical uncertainty in our color excess estimates is @xmath35 mag , slightly larger than that of p99 ; because of a stronger dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath4 , this uncertainty may be as large as @xmath36 mag for sne ia with very high @xmath4 values .",
    "the left half of fig .",
    "3 shows the absolute magnitudes of sne ia as a function of the color parameter @xmath3 .",
    "both quantities were corrected only for galactic reddenings and @xmath15 terms . to mitigate deviations from the hubble expansion caused by peculiar motions , we only considered a subsample of 63 sne ia with redshifts @xmath37 .",
    "the distance to each sn ia was computed with redshifts of host galaxies ( in the reference frame of the cosmic microwave background ) and with a hubble constant @xmath38=72 km s@xmath39 mpc@xmath39 ( e.g. , freedman et al .",
    "2001 ; spergel et al .",
    "a possible peculiar velocity component of 600 km s@xmath39 was included in error bars of the absolute magnitudes ( e.g. , hamuy et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the resulting absolute magnitudes in the @xmath2 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 bands confirm the well - known fact that sne ia display a wide range of peak luminosities .",
    "it is clear that sne ia with larger @xmath30 ( or redder color ) are dimmer and vice versa .",
    "a remarkable correlation emerges naturally as sn 1992bc and sn 1998de appear as extreme source objects with blue and red colors , respectively .",
    "this color@xmath40luminosity relation may be caused by combined effects from reddenings in host galaxies and from intrinsic differences among sne ia , as the slopes given by linear fits to the data are only half of the values of the reddening coefficient @xmath41 observed in the milky way .",
    "dispersions around the best - fit lines in the @xmath2 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 bands are 0.25 , 0.18 , and 0.12 mag , respectively .",
    "the most discrepant points correspond to the severely reddened sne 1995e , 1999gd and 2000ce , but this discrepancy tends to disappear in the @xmath8 band where reddening effects on luminosity become unimportant .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "3 , this plot is repeated for a subsample of 30 out of these 63 sne ia for which we find insignificant reddenings from host galaxies [ i.e. , e@xmath9 ] .",
    "these diagrams reveal more clearly the true nature of the peak luminosity@xmath40color parameter relations for sne ia .",
    "elimination of those sne ia with significant reddenings of host galaxies not only decreases scatters in these correlations but also shows these correlations to be linear in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands , and probably also in the @xmath2 band .",
    "these simple linear correlations apply well to sne ia with different decline rates , including the peculiar events sne 1997cn , 1998bp , 1998de , and 1999da .",
    "corresponding dispersions are 0.10 , 0.07 , and 0.07 mag for the fits in the @xmath2 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 bands , respectively .",
    "these dispersions are comparable to observational errors and leave little room for a dependence on other unknown parameters .",
    "table 2 contains the fitting parameters for the @xmath43 linear correlations for the `` low host galaxy reddening '' subsample of 30 sne ia .",
    "when the four subluminous sne ia are excluded , the best - fit results remain nearly unchanged except for the @xmath2 band , where the slope changes slightly to 1.74@xmath440.19 and the dispersion decreases further down to 0.08 mag .",
    "the impressively low dispersion of these fits strongly supports the validity of @xmath3 as an excellent peak luminosity calibrator for sne ia .",
    "moreover , this shows that normal and peculiar sne ia may be calibrated in a unified manner and argues for their likely common physical origin .",
    "clearly , more subluminous peculiar snia events are needed to firmly establish this empirical correlation .",
    "the physics underlying this important correlation remains to be explored and understood .",
    "in contrast to @xmath3 , the decline rate @xmath4 as a linear function of peak luminosity can not account for a wider range of peak luminosities of sne ia . a quadratic relation argued by p99",
    "may improve but still can not fit well for those peculiar sne ia with high @xmath4 values .",
    "we adopt an exponential function ( garnavich et al .",
    "2004 ) to match the decline rate with peak luminosity for 30 sne ia in the right half of fig .",
    "3 , which leads to dispersions of 0.16 , 0.12 , and 0.10 mag for the fits in the @xmath2 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 bands , respectively .",
    "the much larger and color - dependent dispersions indicate that a single @xmath4 parameter is inadequate to fit all sne ia , whereas the overall fit can be significantly improved with a much reduced dispersion of @xmath45 mag in each band by introducing an additional parameter , namely , the @xmath0 color at the maximum light together with the decline rate .",
    "this demonstrates again the crucial role the color parameter plays in standardizing sne ia .",
    "it might seem that the @xmath3 parameterization resembles somewhat the cmagic method ( wang et al .",
    "2003 ) , as this color parameter is close to the linear regime of the color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "both methods utilize the post - maximum color curves to explore the color - magnitude relation of sne ia .",
    "however , the former specifically emphasizes color differences at a given epoch , while the latter tends to find out a more uniform magnitude at a given color . in the cmagic approach",
    ", a magnitude is inferred from the linear regimes of the cmd . in reference",
    "to peak magnitudes , the cmagic magnitudes are more uniform because of a color standardization , but they still depend strongly on @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "10 of wang et al .",
    "2003 ) ; this means that they are still influenced by light curve shapes .",
    "in contrast , this effect may become the weakest around day 12 after the @xmath2 maximum when maximum differences in color curves manifest among different sne ia .",
    "in fact , this particular epoch corresponds to the time when the brightest and the dimmest sne ia share the common cmagic linear regime . for this reason",
    ", we strongly prefer to use the @xmath0 color at this epoch , namely , @xmath3 , as a key input parameter for a more precise calibration of sne ia .",
    "we here demonstrate that @xmath3 , the @xmath0 color measured 12 days after the @xmath2 maximum , provides effective discriminations among color curves of sne ia .",
    "there is a stronger dependence of @xmath3 on the decline rate @xmath4 of sne ia , and this fact can be readily utilized for estimating reddenings of host galaxies .",
    "the reddenings determined from the @xmath34 relation agree remarkably well with those of phillips et al .",
    ". this would be potentially important for reddening estimates of those sne ia for which photometries are sparse or unavailable at late times ( e.g. , 30 days @xmath46 90 days ) .",
    "we have revealed a very tight linear correlation between @xmath30 and peak luminosities of sne ia .",
    "a simple linear relation seems to fit extremely well for both normal and peculiar sne ia , with a small dispersion of @xmath47 mag for a subsample of sne ia , which suffer insignificant host galaxy reddenings .",
    "this much reduced dispersion is almost comparable to observational error limits . at this level ,",
    "all observed sne ia can be more precisely calibrated in terms of @xmath3 . in comparison with @xmath21",
    ", @xmath3 can be readily quantified as such , and its relative error is smaller than that of @xmath0 at the maximum light .",
    "more importantly , it incarnates the color variations near the maximum light as well as the shape differences of the postmaximum light curves .",
    "these empirical properties make @xmath30 a more robust and reliable parameter for calibrating sne ia , which will bear significant impact for using sne ia as powerful standard candles for cosmological distances .",
    "given our success of using @xmath3 in calibrating peak luminosities of broader sne ia with a reduced dispersion at low redshifts @xmath48 , it would be natural to extend this same color calibration for sne ia at higher redshifts @xmath49 . while probable effects of interstellar extinction for sne ia at @xmath50 are not completely known , some preliminary empirical results suggest that the extinction or reddening per hydrogen atom decreases with increasing @xmath13 ( e.g. , york 2000 ) .",
    "if this is generally true except for peculiarities along particular lines of sight , then our novel color @xmath3 calibration holds great promise in determining the cosmological parameters more accurately using the probe of sne ia in full power .",
