    "the local group is a dynamic environment .",
    "galaxies swarm in the gravitational well of the cluster and move about each other .",
    "the earth - bound observer had only a one - dimensional view of this plethora of motions until a few decades ago : measuring the radial components of velocities was `` easy , '' measuring the tangential components was hard . most of the difficulty lies in measuring the proper motion of a galaxy  which must be done with respect to cosmic standards of rest , such as high - redshift galaxies and quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) . since the size of a proper motion decreases with increasing distance , all else being equal , measuring motions of even the nearest galaxies required time baselines of several tens of years using images taken with the ground - based telescopes or just years when using those taken with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "the analysis of the astrometric data is complex .",
    "the available ground - based images were acquired with a variety of telescopes and imagers and under different atmospheric conditions and air masses and , thus , they contain non - uniform distortions . understanding and characterizing these distortions is essential because the expected measured proper motion is very small  on the order of a few tens of mas  century@xmath1 . although space - based data do not contain distortions caused by the atmosphere , the analysis of such data is still complicated because of several factors . 1 .",
    "useful reference points are scarce .",
    "even bright and compact background galaxies have larger positional uncertainties than star - like objects .",
    "the field of view of _ hst _ is small , thus , a typical image contains too few such galaxies to serve as useful standards of rest . instead , a qso with its star - like point - spread function ( psf ) is the standard of rest of choice .",
    "therefore , the availability of qsos within the appropriate brightness range behind the target galaxy determines the number of independent images  fields .",
    "2 . stars are scarce , ranging in number from a few tens to a few hundreds per field .",
    "this scarcity limits the ability to measure the psf , to transform stellar coordinates between epochs , and to determine the average proper motion of the galaxy .",
    "3 . the images still contain distortions that are inherent to the detectors and optics of _ hst_. the expected motion of stars with respect to the qso is on the order of a few thousandth of a pixel in several years , therefore , a model for these distortions should be accurate to a sub - pixel scale .",
    "none of the existing models has such accuracy . despite these obstacles , clever observations and data analysis",
    "have allowed the list of nearby galaxies with a measured proper motion to grow steadily .    in alphabetical order ,",
    "the list now contains : draco @xcite , canis major @xcite , carina @xcite , fornax @xcite , lmc @xcite , m33 @xcite , sagittarius @xcite , sculptor @xcite , smc @xcite , and ursa minor @xcite .",
    "this sample is becoming large enough to reveal the three - dimensional nature of motions in the local group .",
    "notable is the measurement for m33 , the triangulum galaxy , the third most luminous galaxy in the local group at a distance from the milky way comparable to that for m31 .",
    "@xcite use radio observations with the very long baseline array of two groups of water masers located on opposite sides of the galaxy to derive a proper motion on the order of @xmath8as  yr@xmath1 .",
    "this is the smallest proper motion of a galaxy ever measured .",
    "the uncertainties in the model of the rotation of m33 and not measurement errors dominate the uncertainty of this proper motion .",
    "just as the motions of planets around the sun contain information about the mass distribution in and the formation of the solar system , space velocities of galaxies contain such information for the local group .",
    "in addition , the space velocities give galactic orbits , and these can demonstrate if the galaxies evolved in seclusion or if they influenced each other through close encounters , collisions , or mergers .",
    "dark matter continues to evade direct detection .",
    "its gravitational interaction with the luminous matter and light is the key observational clue for its existence . on a galactic scale ,",
    "the rotation curve of a spiral galaxy or the velocity dispersion profile of an elliptical galaxy are such key observations , whereas , on the scale of galaxy groups , it is the velocity dispersion of the member galaxies . knowing all three components of the space velocities of the galaxies",
    "provides a check on the assumption of velocity isotropy in the mass estimates based on the velocity dispersion .",
    "it also offers additional ways of constraining the amount and distribution of dark matter .",
    "for example , for the milky way and its satellite dwarf galaxies one may : 1 . derive a lower limit for the mass of the milky way from the assumption that a satellite galaxy is bound or derive an estimate of the mass of the milky way out to the radius of the satellites from their velocity dispersion .",
    "2 . derive a limit on the amount of dark matter in a satellite galaxy that approaches the milky way closely enough that the galactic tidal force is significant compared to the self - gravity of the galaxy .",
    "the space velocities of galaxies can also test more general features of models for a cold dark matter cosmology by : 1 . comparing the distributions of the observed orbital elements with those predicted by numerical simulations of the formation of the local group @xcite .",
    "investigating possible close encounters and collisions among the satellite galaxies @xcite .",
    "two interesting ideas about the formation of the satellite galaxies of the milky way challenge the picture that these galaxies are surviving substructure , predicted by cold dark matter cosmology .",
    "@xcite propose that some galactic satellite galaxies and globular clusters move along similar orbits  they are members of a `` stream '' formed when the tidal force of the milky way tore a progenitor satellite galaxy into fragments .",
    "the fragments continue to move together on the orbit of the progenitor in the absence of collisions , significant orbital precession , or dynamical friction .",
    "this is a testable idea : @xcite predict proper motions for the members of proposed streams .",
    "the other testable idea is based on the `` planar '' distribution of the galactic dwarf galaxies .",
    "@xcite note that the 11 galaxies nearest to the milky way lie within a disk whose thickness - to - radius ratio is @xmath9  0.15 .",
    "@xcite argue that such a distribution of satellites is very unlikely for the substructure predicted by cold dark matter cosmologies , though this is disputed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "if the orbits of the satellites are indeed within the disk , the geometry of the plane predicts the coordinates of their poles .",
    "note that the galaxies do not have to share the same orbit  be in a stream  for their orbital poles to be the same , all that is required is that their orbits must be in the same plane .",
    "this article is one of a series that is attempting to better - define the kinematics of the local group and reports a measurement of the proper motion for the fornax dsph galaxy .",
    "the measurement derives from a larger set of data than and , thus , replaces the preliminary measurement reported in @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : fornax ] presents fornax , emphasizing those of its physical and structural properties that are relevant to our analysis .",
    "section  [ sec : data ] describes the observations and data and section  [ sec : mpm ] explains the process of deriving the proper motion making use of several key performance diagnostics .",
    "the next three sections ,  [ sec : pm ] ,  [ sec : orbit ] , and ",
    "[ sec : disc ] , present the measured proper motion and space velocity , calculate the implied galactic orbit , and discuss the implications of the motion , respectively .",
    "the final section ,  [ sec : summary ] , is a summary .",
    "among the galactic dsphs , fornax is one of the `` giants . ''",
    "the luminosity of fornax , given in table  1 , is comparable to that of sagittarius , at least three times greater than that of the next most luminous dsph , leo i , and about two orders of magnitude greater than that of the least luminous  draco .",
    "fornax and sgr are the only dsphs with confirmed globular clusters .",
    "reviews of research on dwarf galaxies in the local group by @xcite and @xcite , and a study of structure of the galactic dsphs by @xcite are convenient sources for a side - by - side comparison of the dsphs .",
    "discovered by shapley @xcite , fornax is at the celestial location @xmath10 @xcite in the j2000.00 equatorial coordinate system .",
    "this location corresponds to @xmath11 in the galactic coordinate system .",
    "the galaxy is only about 21@xmath12 on the sky from the sculptor dsph .",
    "@xcite derived a distance modulus of @xmath13 for fornax using the magnitude of the tip of the red giant branch .",
    "the data consist of ground - based observations in the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 bands of four overlapping fields , each with an effective area of @xmath17 .",
    "the implied heliocentric distance is @xmath18  kpc .",
    "our study adopts this distance when calculating distance - dependent quantities .",
    "an earlier measurement of the distance modulus by @xcite , using archival _ hst _",
    "photometry in the f555w and f814w bands of cluster 4 in fornax and its surroundings , produced a similar value .",
    "several studies have investigated the structure of fornax using wide - field imaging .",
    "a `` benchmark '' investigation is that by @xcite , who used star counts from a photographic plate taken with uk schmidt telescope to derive the key structural parameters .",
    "their field of view is about 36  deg@xmath19 . in a similar manner ,",
    "the study also derives structural parameters for seven other dsphs .",
    "table  1 lists the values for the ellipticity , position angle , and core and tidal radii from @xcite .",
    "this contribution adopts these values where they are needed .",
    "an analysis of deeper images , albeit with smaller areal coverage , by @xcite produces a similar set of structural parameters as that in @xcite .",
    "the images cover an area of 8.5  deg@xmath19 and reach a limiting magnitude of 23.5 in the @xmath15 band .",
    "the resulting isopleth map shows a steeper decline in the projected surface density on the south and east sides of the galaxy _ versus _ the north and west sides  a behavior noted previously by several studies , for example , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite surveyed fornax producing images with a total areal coverage of 10  deg@xmath19 in the @xmath15 and @xmath16 bands and reaching a limiting magnitude @xmath20 .",
    "the surface density of stars selected to lie along the giant branch shows that : 1 ) stars beyond the @xcite tidal radius are found to the north - west and south - east of the galaxy , which is the orientation of the minor axis and 2 ) there is an additional overdensity of stars in a shell about 1.3@xmath21 to the north - west of the galaxy .",
    "@xcite argued that the asymmetry in the surface density profile noted in the previous paragraph is caused by another shell about @xmath22 to the south - east and that this feature is dominated by a stellar population with an age of about 2  gyrs . @xcite",
    "propose that these two shells and the other extra - tidal stars are the signature of the infall of a gas - rich galaxy with @xmath23 .",
    "deeper imaging by @xcite confirms that the inner shell contains an excess of stars formed in a burst about 1.4  gyr ago .",
    "the location of these stars in the color - magnitude diagram indicates that they have [ fe / h]@xmath24 , which is higher than that expected for a low - luminosity dwarf galaxy and implies that these stars formed from enriched gas originating from fornax .",
    "the conflict between the evidence for infall  shells and extratidal stars  and the high metallicity of the inner shell may perhaps be resolved by star formation stimulated by a minor merger .",
    "@xcite measured radial velocities for 44 stars in two fields located in the direction of fornax .",
    "one field coincides with the center of the galaxy and the other is about two core radii away from the center in the south - west direction . after excluding 12 likely non - member stars from the sample ,",
    "the measured radial velocities imply a heliocentric systemic velocity of @xmath25  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the sample shows no evidence for a significant rotation around the minor axis .",
    "the velocity dispersion is @xmath26  km  s@xmath1 in the central field and @xmath27  km  s@xmath1 in the outer  thus , the velocity dispersion does not vary significantly with the projected radius .",
    "the study derives a mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath28 ) of @xmath29 in solar units for the center of fornax , but notes that @xmath28s in the range between 5.3 and 26 are also acceptable given the uncertainties in the fitted structural parameters .",
    "more recently , @xcite measured radial velocities for an additional 176 stars scattered throughout the galaxy and combined these measurements with those in @xcite in their analysis .",
    "the combined sample with the most stringent exclusion of non - members implies @xmath30  km  s@xmath1 for the heliocentric radial velocity , which our contribution adopts when calculating quantities that depend on this parameter .",
    "the global velocity dispersion is @xmath31  km  s@xmath1 ; the velocity dispersion calculated in radial bins does not vary with projected radius .",
    "@xcite and @xcite independently measured the proper motion of fornax .",
    "the measurement by @xcite of @xmath32  mas  century@xmath1 derives from _ hst _ images of three distinct fields using stis or wfpc2 . for two of these fields ,",
    "the data are at two epochs separated by 1 - 2 years . for the third field ,",
    "the data are at three epochs with a total time baseline of 2 years .",
    "the measurement of @xcite is preliminary because it was based on partial data while the observing program was still ongoing .",
    "the measurement quoted in this contribution , which derives from the complete set of data , replaces the older preliminary measurement .",
    "the measurement by @xcite of @xmath33  mas  century@xmath1 derives from a combination of ground - based and _ hst _ imaging .",
    "the time baseline between epochs varies between 20 and 50 years .",
    "some of the space - based data are the same as those in @xcite , but they are such a tiny fraction of the whole dataset that the measurement in @xcite can be considered independent from that in @xcite or this article .",
    "the data consist of images taken with _",
    "hst _ in three distinct fields in the direction of fornax .",
    "each field contains at least one known qso .",
    "figure  [ fig : fields ] shows the configuration of the fields  each represented by a square  on a @xmath34 section of the sky .",
    "the center of fornax is at @xmath35 .",
    "north is up and east is to the left .",
    "the dashed ellipse in the figure represents the core .",
    "its semi - major axis , ellipticity , and position angle are those in table  1 .",
    "one of the three fields  the smallest in size  is within the core and close to the minor axis .",
    "an arrow emanating from a field points in the direction of the positive @xmath36 axis in the ccd .",

    "the most northern field is for  j@xmath37 .",
    "it is approximately centered on image a of a lensed qso discovered by @xcite and located at @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "image b of the qso is @xmath39 away from image a. @xcite measured the @xmath14-band magnitude and @xmath40 color of image a to be @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively , and of image b to be @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",

    "the observations produced 18 , 16 , and 16 images , respectively , each with an exposure time of 160  s ( column 7 of table  2 ) . the position angle of 156.6@xmath21 for the y axis of the ccd is the same to within 0.01@xmath21 for all of the exposures . figure  [ fig : f2 ] is a sample image from the 1999 epoch",
    ".    the other two fields shown in figure  [ fig : fields ] are , in order of decreasing declination for  j@xmath45 and for  j@xmath46 . again",
    ", each field contains and is approximately centered on a known qso . @xcite",

    "for all of these observations , hst used the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) with no filter ( 50ccd ) .",
    "there are 24 images per epoch of the for  j@xmath45 field , each with an exposure time of 192  s , for a total of 72 images .",
    "the position angle of the y axis for all of the images is 32.4@xmath21 to within 0.05@xmath21 .",
    "there are also 24 images per epoch in the for  j@xmath46 field for a total of 72 images .",
    "the average exposure times at the three epochs are 193  s , 192  s , and 189  s , respectively , and the position angle of the y axis is 69.7@xmath12 to within 0.06@xmath21 .",
    "table  2 summarizes the above information .",
    "figures  [ fig : f3 ] and [ fig : f4 ] are sample images from the earliest observations in the two fields .      during the readout of a ccd ,",
    "the electrical charge present in a pixel at the end of an exposure transfers from pixel to pixel towards the transfer register . for stis , this motion is in the positive @xmath36 direction , or `` up , '' whereas for pc2 , it is in the negative , or `` down , '' direction . once in the transfer register , the charge moves along the @xmath49 direction to the circuit that measures its amount .",
    "the transfer of the charge is imperfect : ccd pixels contain `` charge traps '' which both capture and release charge .",
    "thus , the quantity of charge passing through a pixel can either increase , if more charge is captured than released , or decrease , if the reverse is true .",
    "because the charge traps have a finite capacity , they have a smaller fractional effect on bright sources than on faint sources .",
    "the origin of charge traps is not completely understood , but it is known that the efficiency of charge transfer in stis and wfpc2 decreases with time @xcite  most likely because of defects in the crystal lattice of the ccd created by cosmic radiation @xcite . therefore , the effect of charge traps on the photometry and astrometry increases with time .",
    "@xcite describe the various effects caused by charge traps and why these effects arise , emphasizing the impact on time - dependent astrometry such as the measurement of a proper motion .",
    "figure  [ fig : f5 ] illustrates how charge traps can create a spurious proper motion .",
    "consider a field that contains three stars with similar signal values and a qso with a much larger signal . in the figure ,",
    "the stars and the qso are represented by open circles and a solid square , respectively , and are labeled as @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "the qso is the reference point .",
    "assume that the stars , the qso , and the observer are at rest with respect to each other , which means that the observer should detect no motion for any star with respect to the qso .",
    "figure  [ fig : f5 ] depicts two hypothetical images of this field taken at @xmath54 and at @xmath55 with exactly the same pointings of the telescope and with a ccd that contains charge traps whose number has increased with time .",
    "let the measured centroid of a source be depicted by the location of the source in an image .",
    "because in the time interval @xmath56 separating the two images the number of charge traps has increased , a centroid in the later image has a smaller value of @xmath36  it has shifted away from the transfer register . here",
    "we ignore a possible shift in the @xmath49 direction resulting from inefficient charge transfer in the serial register since this inefficiency is negligible for stis @xcite and one - third as large as in the parallel direction for wfpc2 @xcite .",
    "the arrows @xmath57 , and @xmath58 represent these shifts for the qso and the three stars , respectively .",
    "the magnitude of the shift is larger the smaller the signal of the object and the greater its distance from the serial register .",
    "thus , for example , @xmath52 has a spurious motion in the coordinate system of the ccd of @xmath59 , which implies that the observer would measure a proper motion for @xmath52 with respect to the qso .",
    "both wfpc2 and stis contain charge traps",
    "whose number increases with time as a consequence of the ongoing production of lattice defects by the cosmic radiation @xcite .",
    "the transfer register is at the bottom of the image for pc2 and at the top for stis .",
    "therefore , the centroids shift towards larger values of @xmath36 , or `` up , '' for pc2 and towards smaller values of @xmath36 , or `` down , '' for stis .",
    "accurate astrometry requires either that the shifts are accounted for in the analysis or that a ccd image be `` restored '' so that its pixels have the same values as immediately before the readout .",
    "@xcite developed a software package that restores an image taken with stis , which was used to correct all of our images taken with stis prior to our analysis .",
    "no corresponding software exists for restoring an image taken with pc2 . in this case , our analysis measures and removes the shifts  the details are in section  [ sec : pmpc ] .    to estimate",
    "how greatly the decreasing charge transfer efficiency can affect the measured proper motion , this study performs a parallel analysis ignoring the effects of charge traps and comments on the difference .",
    "@xcite and references therein describe our method of deriving a proper motion from undersampled images taken with _",
    "this article outlines briefly the four major components of the method .",
    "determine the initial estimates for the centroids of objects  stars and the qsos .",
    "this task uses stand - alone astronomy software packages such as daophot , allstar , and daomaster @xcite . for each field and epoch",
    ", this step produces a list of objects at that epoch and the translational offsets between the chronologically first image of an epoch  the fiducial image  and those that follow .",
    "the centroid of an object on the list is in the coordinate system of the fiducial image ; however , its centroid in any other image derives from the known offsets .",
    "construct an effective point - spread function ( epsf ; @xcite ) for each field and epoch . using a select set of stars and the qsos ,",
    "our method builds a single , position - independent or constant epsf that is used for all of the images of a field at an epoch .",
    "an object contributes to the construction of the epsf if its signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) is greater than some limit  15 for these data  and if its inner @xmath60 array of pixels ( see @xcite for details about the structure of the data ) have data quality flags equal to 0 .",
    "if there are @xmath61 images for a given field and epoch , an object may contribute up to @xmath61 times to the construction of the epsf  fewer if the object is flagged out in some images .",
    "derive accurate centroids for objects by fitting an epsf to the image of each object using least squares .",
    "the fitting procedure for a set of images at an epoch involves an interplay between the centroids , the epsf , and the transformation between the coordinate system of an image and the fiducial image .",
    "an improvement in the centroids leads to more accurate transformations and a better estimate of the epsf and this is iterated until a stable solution ensues .",
    "averaging the centroids from each image transformed to the coordinate system of the fiducial image produces the coordinate for an object at one epoch and its uncertainty .",
    "the fiducial coordinate systems for different epochs are generally offset from each other because of small changes in the telescope pointing and rotation and are also not congruent because of changes in image scale and telescope motion ( the aberration of starlight ) .",
    "determine the motion of the qso in a `` standard '' coordinate system .",
    "in this coordinate system , the stars of the dsph are at rest while all other objects move .",
    "a proper motion of the dsph derives from the reflex motion of the qso in this coordinate system .",
    "the standard coordinate system is defined as the fiducial coordinate system of the first epoch .",
    "the @xmath49 and @xmath36 coordinates of a star of the dsph in this system are the average of its coordinates at the three epochs transformed into the standard coordinate system .",
    "a six - parameter linear transformation converts coordinates to the standard coordinate system .",
    "the transformation also includes a fitted linear motion for the qso and , iteratively , for objects whose large scatter in their transformed coordinates indicate that they are not members of the dsph . for data taken with pc2 ,",
    "an additional term in the transformation that is linear with @xmath62 and depends on the flux of an object corrects the effects caused by charge traps .",
    "both stis and wfpc2 exhibit geometric distortions which are several pixels at the edge of the field",
    ". these are large compared to the approximately 0.001  pixel precision in measuring the positions of objects required to determine the proper motion of a dsph .",
    "even the accuracy with which the distortions are known is larger than the required precision , so our observations must minimize the impact of the distortions .",
    "thus , the observations attempted to place objects on the same pixels of the ccd at each epoch .",
    "if the execution of this plan were perfect , no correction for the distortions would have been necessary .",
    "although the roll angles are similar to a high degree , there are linear offsets between epochs on the order of a few tens of pixels .",
    "therefore , our method corrects the distortions using the prescriptions from the stis data handbook @xcite for the data taken with stis and from @xcite for the data taken with wfpc2 .",
    "an error in the manufacture of the wfpc2 ccds makes every 34th row in the pc2 images narrower than the other rows @xcite . dubbed the `` 34th - row defect",
    ", '' it can produce a spurious contribution to the measurement of the proper motion .",
    "our method corrects the centroids for the effect of this defect using the prescription from @xcite .",
    "@xcite developed diagnostics for the performance of their algorithm that determines the centroids of objects .",
    "the remainder of this section describes the `` flux residual '' and `` position residual '' diagnostics and how the algorithm performed in the three fields .",
    "the flux residual diagnostic , @xmath63 , defined by equation  22 in @xcite is a measure of how well the constructed epsf matches an image of an object . if the match is perfect , @xmath64 .",
    "however , if the image of an object is wider than the epsf , @xmath65 ; otherwise , @xmath66 .",
    "if @xmath63 does depart from zero , the departure increases with increasing s / n for an object .",
    "plotting @xmath63 as a function of position in a ccd can reveal potential flaws in the data and analysis .",
    "in the presence of only random noise , a plot of @xmath63 _ versus _ @xmath49 or @xmath36 would show that the points scatter around @xmath67 .",
    "any other distribution is undesirable and can mean , for example , that the true psf varies with position in a ccd , that the constructed epsf has an incorrect shape , or that the psf of an object is distinctly different from the epsf , as it would be in the case of a galaxy with a resolved core .",
    "figure  [ rf - pc ] plots @xmath63 _ versus _ @xmath49 in the left column and @xmath63 _ versus _ @xmath36 in the right column for the for  j@xmath37 field imaged with pc2 . from top to bottom , the plots are for the epochs 1999 , 2001 , and 2003 .",
    "solid squares mark the points corresponding to image a of the qso , whereas the solid triangles do the same for image b.    all of the plots show a modest `` bow - shaped '' dependence of @xmath63 on @xmath49 and @xmath36 indicating that the true psf varies with location . the constructed epsf is narrower than the true psf around the edges of the ccd and wider near the center .",
    "the values of @xmath63 for both images of the qso tend to be negative ; those for image a are more negative than those for image b , most likely because of the variation of the psf across the image .",
    "the @xmath63 for the qso is more negative than those of most nearby stars , which could be due to the higher s / n of the qso or , perhaps , to a narrower psf caused by the bluer color of the qso .",

    "the values of @xmath63 for the qso are positive for all epochs and most of these points are outside of the top boundary in the upper two rows of plots .",

    "the bottom line lists our measurement from table  3 .",
    "the proper motion of fornax predicted for stream 4a is in the closest agreement with our measurement , though even here the difference is more than 3.2 times the measurement uncertainty in one component .",
    "given that there must be some uncertainty in the predicted motions , this difference may not be large enough to rule out membership in stream 4a .",
    "however , @xcite ruled out the membership of sculptor in stream 4a , so the reality of the stream hinges on the agreement between the predicted and actual proper motions of the remaining three members . currently , neither sextans nor pal 3 has a measured proper motion .",
    "@xcite noted that viewing 11 of the innermost dwarf galaxies , satellites of the milky way , from a point at infinity with @xmath151 shows that the galaxies lie on nearly the same plane , whose poles are at @xmath152 and @xmath153 . the probability is less than @xmath154 that such an alignment of galaxies occurs by chance if the galaxies have an isotropic distribution of orbits . if the planar alignment is to persist in time , the dwarf galaxies must have orbits contained in this plane .",
    "therefore , its persistence can be tested if proper motions of the galaxies are known .",
    "let the pole of an orbit be in the direction of the orbital angular momentum vector .",
    "thus , the galactic coordinates of the pole in terms of the orbital elements are : @xmath155 for prograde orbits , @xmath156 , and for retrograde , @xmath157 . using the best estimates for @xmath158 and @xmath159 from table  8 and uncertainties that are 1-@xmath117 errors from monte carlo simulations ,",
    "the orbital pole of fornax is at @xmath160 .",
    "the poles of the orbit and plane are separated by @xmath161 .",
    "the separation is larger than the measurement uncertainties , however , the agreement between the two poles does not need to be exact because the plane has a finite thickness .",
    "@xcite find an rms distance from their plane of 26.4  kpc for the sample of 11 galaxies  which extends to about twice the distance of fornax .",
    "this thickness is consistent with their claim of a ratio of height to radius of 0.15 for the disk .",
    "the tilt between the orbit of fornax and the plane predicts that the time - averaged rms distance of fornax from the plane is 47  kpc .",
    "this calculation assumes a circular orbit with a radius of 135  kpc , which is the average of the peri- and apogalacticons .",
    "we conclude that the orbit of fornax is inconsistent with the plane . whether the orbits of the dsphs are consistent with the predictions of @xmath162-cdm models for the local group will be addressed in a later article when measurements become available for draco and sextans .",
    "@xcite and @xcite detected a population of blue and young main - sequence stars in fornax .",
    "the stars are about @xmath163 years old and located in the central region of the galaxy .",
    "quoting @xcite , the population `` has a flattened distribution on the sky and its major axis is offset by roughly @xmath164 from the symmetry axis of the galaxy as a whole . ''",
    "this detection implies that fornax had to have hi @xmath163 years ago .",
    "however , a search for hi with the vla by @xcite produced no detection at the limit of @xmath165  @xmath166 at the galaxy center and @xmath167  @xmath166 at the distance of one core radius from the center .",
    "@xcite searched for hi near the dwarf galaxies in the local group using the parkes radio telescope .",
    "the survey confirmed the result of @xcite that there is no hi at the center of fornax , but did identify gas offset about @xmath168 north and west - northwest from the center .",
    "the strongest emission is between position angles of about 325@xmath21 and 360@xmath21 ( see figure 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "the velocity of the gas is also offset  about 30  km  s@xmath1 below that of the stars .",
    "@xcite calculate an approximately 10% probability that this gas is a chance superposition of a high - velocity cloud .",
    "this probability is not low enough to decisively establish a physical relationship between the gas and the galaxy . @xcite",
    "also note that subtracting the emission from the milky way is difficult for these observations .",
    "if there is no hi associated with fornax , then why do young stars reside in the central region ?",
    "if the hi is associated , why is it offset in both position and velocity ?",
    "trying to answer such questions , @xcite offers two possibilities : ( 1 ) there is gas in the central region but it is either ionized or molecular or ( 2 ) hi was displaced from the central region in the past @xmath163 years .",
    "there are no published results of searches for hii or molecular gas , and so , ( 1 ) can not be ignored or excluded until such results exist . in the case of ( 2 ) , there must be a physical mechanism for displacing the gas .",
    "a supernova - driven wind blowing the gas from the center is one possible mechanism @xcite .",
    "ram pressure due to the motion of the galaxy through a gaseous halo of the milky way is another mechanism , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite or @xcite . in this case",
    ", the gas would trail the dsph and be displaced in the direction opposite to the galactic rest - frame proper motion vector .",
    "this vector has a position angle of @xmath169 , _",
    "i.e. _ pointing in the southeast direction , which would predict that the gas should be at a position angle of about 300@xmath21 .",
    "however , the strongest hi emission has a position angle of about 340@xmath21 and the elongation of the cloud is not aligned with the proper motion vector . @xcite",
    "propose a variation of the ram - pressure picture in which fornax crossed the magellanic plane  the plane containing the orbit of the lmc as defined by the space velocity from @xcite  about 190 myr ago and passed through gas that was removed from the lmc but which still trails this gas - rich galaxy .",
    "this picture can be tested using our new proper motion for fornax and a recently - measured proper motion for the lmc .",
    "@xcite measured the proper motion of the lmc using an observational technique similar to the one employed in this contribution .",
    "the measurement is based on _ hst _ observations of 21 qsos in the direction of the lmc with the high resolution camera of the advanced camera for surveys .",
    "the qsos were discovered by their variability in the macho survey @xcite .",
    "the measured proper motion of the lmc is @xmath170  mas  century@xmath1 .    integrating the two orbits backwards in time in the potential given by eqs .",
    "[ diskpot][logpot ] shows that fornax crosses the orbital plane of the lmc about 1.4  gyr ago and it does so at a distance of only 1.9  kpc from the orbit of the lmc .",
    "however , when fornax is closest to the lmc orbit , the lmc will not arrive at that point for about another 0.8  gyr .",
    "numerical experiments that integrate the orbits using starting velocities with uncertainties determined by the observations indicate that fornax crosses the plane of the lmc orbit between 0.80  gyr and 2.0  gyr ago with 95% confidence .",
    "fornax approaches closer than 20  kpc to the orbit of the lmc in about 50% of the simulations .",
    "the monte carlo simulations show that the two galaxies do not come closer than 81  kpc at 97.5% confidence .    for the orbits adopted here ,",
    "the recent loss of hi from fornax 190  myr ago can not be attributed to the ram pressure from gas in the lmc orbital plane .",
    "the last crossing of the orbital plane by fornax occurred about 1.4  gyr ago , which is 1  gyr before the cessation of star formation in the dsph .",
    "the plane crossing occurred 0.6  gyr before the cessation of star formation with 97.5% confidence .",
    "our conclusion differs from that of @xcite because of differences in the adopted orbits for fornax and , particularly , the lmc .",
    "though an interaction between fornax and gas from the lmc can not explain the recent cessation of star formation in the dsph , the orbits of the two galaxies are likely to approach closely .",
    "it is still an open question whether this intersection of orbits has affected the star formation history or gas content of fornax .",
    "the strongest argument against such an effect is that the closest approach of the two orbits occurs before the arrival of the lmc at that point .",
    "however , the amount of gas in the leading and trailing parts of the orbit are uncertain .",
    "the proper motion for the lmc of @xcite implies a galactocentric space velocity of 380  km  s@xmath1 , which yields an orbital period  calculated using the method in section  [ sec : orbit ]  of 4.3  gyr .",
    "this period is almost three times longer than that assumed in the canonical models for the formation of the magellanic stream @xcite .",
    "this conflict between the measured motion of the lmc and the models for the formation of the magellanic stream means that it is premature to rule out the removal of gas from fornax by interaction with the stream .",
    "an interaction with hi leading the lmc could have removed at least some gas from fornax .",
    "@xcite identified what appears to be a leading tidal tail in hi maps .",
    "however , the likelihood of an interaction is decreased because the leading tail contains only about 25% as much gas as the trailing tail and the gas is organized in three disjoint complexes rather than in a continuous distribution @xcite .",
    "if fornax formed as a spherical system and if the galactic tidal force has had an important effect on its structure , then the projected ellipticity would be the result of the stretching of the dsph in its orbital plane ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , a nearly galactocentric observer would see the galactic rest - frame proper motion vector aligned with the projected major axis . from table 1 ,",
    "the position angle of the major axis is @xmath171 , whereas this angle for the weighted mean galactic rest - frame proper motion is @xmath172 .",
    "within the uncertainties , these two angles are almost orthogonal to each other ; in other words , the true major axis is not in the orbital plane .    notwithstanding",
    "the disagreement in the two position angles above , the structure of fornax exhibits several features which could have arisen as a consequence of tidal interaction with the milky way .",
    "most recently , @xcite show that : ( 1 ) the ellipticity of the isodensity contours increases with increasing semi - major axis , reaching a maximum at around @xmath173 , and then decreases beyond this radius ; ( 2 ) the position angle of ellipses fitted to the stellar surface density decreases with increasing semi - major axis ; ( 3 ) isodensity contours on the eastern side of the galaxy are closer together than those on the western ; and ( 4 ) the map of the stellar surface density shows stars of the dsph beyond the fitted tidal radius along the minor axis .",
    "the feature which is most suggestive of a tidal interaction is ( 4 ) .",
    "the direction of the galactic rest - frame proper motion supports this picture ; however , other aspects of the orbit do not : the large perigalacticon , long orbital period , small eccentricity , and approaching motion of the dsph do not favor the tidal origin for the observed `` extratidal '' stars .",
    "@xcite propose that instead of the galactic tidal force , a collision and merger event with another system is responsible for this observed feature .",
    "assuming that mass follows light and using the measured velocity dispersion , @xcite derived a @xmath174 of @xmath175 in solar units for fornax , noting that @xmath174s in the range between 5.3 and 26 are also possible given the uncertainties in the fitted structural parameters .",
    "the subsequent derivations of @xmath176 by @xcite and @xcite are within this quoted range . knowing the orbit of a dsph permits another approach to constraining its mass .",
    "the mass and orbit determine the tidal radius  the radius beyond which a star becomes unbound from the dsph due to gravitational interaction with the milky way . making the assumption that the tidal radius is equal to the observed limiting radius then provides a value for the @xmath176 .",
    "the value commonly adopted for the limiting radius is the limiting radius of a @xcite model fitted to the radial surface brightness profile ( unfortunately often also called the tidal radius ) .",
    "an exponential  which has no limiting radius  is also a good fit to the surface brightness profiles of dsphs , so the identification of the limiting radius determined from a king model with the tidal radius may be incorrect .",
    "nevertheless , we calculate the @xmath176 of fornax by equating the limiting and tidal radii . a constraint on the @xmath176 of a dsph with fewer assumptions , also given below ,",
    "is that it must be large enough for the dsph to have survived the tidal interaction with the milky way given its measured orbit .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : rt ] ) @xcite gives the tidal radius , @xmath177 , as a function of the orbital elements of a dsph moving in a logarithmic potential for the milky way .",
    "@xmath178\\ln[(1+e)/(1-e ) ] + 1 } \\ , \\frac{m}{m_g}\\right)^{1/3 } a. \\label{eq : rt}\\ ] ] in the equation , @xmath179 is eccentricity of the orbit , @xmath86 is the semi - major axis ( @xmath180 ) , @xmath181 is the mass of the dsph , and @xmath182 is the mass of the milky way within @xmath86 .",
    "equating @xmath177 with the observed limiting radius derived by fitting a @xcite model , @xmath183 , gives a value for @xmath176 for a given orbit .",
    "estimates of the limiting radius for fornax range from @xmath184 @xcite to @xmath185 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath186 , then 10.4% of the orbits have @xmath187 in 1000 monte carlo simulations similar to those that determined the uncertainties in the orbital elements ; 0.2% of the orbits have @xmath188 .",
    "if @xmath189 , then 100% of the orbits have @xmath187 and 5.3% have @xmath188 .",
    "these results show that there is only a 5.3% chance that the global @xmath174 of fornax is greater than 26 if the larger of the limiting radii is identified with the tidal radius .",
    "in other words , the orbit of fornax is consistent with the broad range of @xmath176 values derived from virial equilibrium models and the observed limiting radius of the dsph and , thus , these calculations do not provide a strong constraint on the amount of dark matter in fornax .",
    "the average measured @xmath28 for galactic globular clusters is 2.3 @xcite .",
    "could fornax have a @xmath28 equal to this value and survive the effect of the galactic tidal force until the present on our derived orbit ?",
    "numerical simulations of tidal interactions by @xcite and @xcite show that the ratio of the limiting radius derived by fitting a theoretical king model @xcite , @xmath183 , to the tidal radius defined by equation  ( [ eq : rt ] ) is a useful indicator of the importance of the galactic tidal force on the structure of a dsph .",
    "these simulations show that : if @xmath190 , the galactic tidal force has little effect on the structure of the dsph ; at @xmath191 , the effect of the force increases rapidly with increasing @xmath192 ; and , for @xmath193 , the dsph disintegrates in a few orbits . assuming that @xmath194 and @xmath186 , @xmath195 for 0.3% of the orbits generated in monte carlo simulations . if @xmath189 , the fraction is 10.8% .",
    "thus , it is very likely that fornax could have survived for a hubble time on its current orbit while containing only luminous matter .",
    "we conclude that our orbit of fornax and the observed limiting radius do not constrain the amount of dark matter in the dsph .",
    "the space velocity of fornax imposes a lower limit on the mass of the milky way , which is given by : @xmath196 where @xmath138 is the galactocentric distance , and @xmath132 and @xmath197 are the radial and tangential components of the space velocity , respectively , as measured by an observer at the center of the galaxy .",
    "equation [ eq : mmw ] assumes a spherically symmetric mass distribution and 0 for the total energy of the satellite galaxy . setting @xmath198  kpc and using the values from table  7 for @xmath132 and @xmath197 , @xmath199 .",
    "this estimate does not place a strong constraint on the amount of mass within 140  kpc of the center of the milky way since the value is similar to the @xmath200 within @xmath201  kpc found by @xcite .",
    "this contribution continues a series of articles , each reporting the proper motion of a dsph ; here , we present a measurement for fornax which replaces the value based on only part of the data in @xcite .",
    "the data come from imaging with the _ hst _ and stis or pc2 . using the measured proper motion",
    ", we integrate the motion of the dsph to obtain its orbit and then discuss the proposed membership of fornax in streams of satellites , the possible alignment of orbits of the galactic satellites in a single plane , the association between hi and the dsph , the proposed interaction between the lmc and fornax , the tidal interaction of the dsph with the milky way , the dark matter content of fornax , and a lower limit on the mass of the milky way .",
    "the major findings are itemized below .",
    "the galactic rest - frame proper motion is that measured by an observer at the location of the sun and at rest with respect to the galactic center . in this system ,",
    "the proper motion is @xmath2  mas  century@xmath1 .",
    "the weighted means of the radial and tangential components of the space velocity with respect to a stationary observer at the galactic center are @xmath203  km  s@xmath1 and @xmath204  km  s@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the negative sign of @xmath132 means that fornax is approaching the milky way .",
    "the orbit resulting from the integration of the best estimate of the motion in a realistic potential of the milky way shows that fornax is approaching a perigalacticon of 118  kpc on an approximately polar orbit with an eccentricity of 0.13 .",
    "the apogalacticon of the orbit is 152  kpc and the orbital period is 3.2  gyr .",
    "fornax is not a member of stream 1a , 1b , or 4b of @xcite , though it could be a member of stream 4a . since @xcite ruled out the membership of the sculptor dsph in stream 4a , the reality of this stream depends on whether the proper motions of the other proposed members , which still need to be measured , agree with the predictions .",
    "our findings do not support the hypothesis of @xcite that fornax lost its hi about 200  myr ago as it passed through the stream of gas trailing the lmc in its orbit .",
    "our proper motion for fornax and that of @xcite for the lmc show that fornax approaches within about 1.9  kpc of the orbit of the lmc , but 1.4  gyr ago and 0.8  gyr before the lmc arrives at that point .",
    "an interaction 1.4  gyr ago does not explain why star formation in fornax continued until 200  myr ago , though uncertainties in modeling the magellanic stream keep this mechanism for the loss of hi from fornax from being definitively ruled out .",
