    "here we use a non - conventional parametrization in terms of a phenomenological interpolating function @xmath6 defined in such a way that it relates the effective or observed gravitational field @xmath2 , to the standard newtonian expression @xmath7 , namely @xmath8 here @xmath9 denotes the mass distribution in the object , and the subscript @xmath10 in the different quantities stresses that there are only baryons ( in the cosmological acceptance of the word ) in the configuration .",

    "it has been extensively argued in the literature that this simple modification of the gravitational interaction can reproduce the flattening of the rotational curves as well as the baryonic tully - fisher relation in spiral galaxies without postulating the existence of any new exotic matter component  @xcite .",
    "apart form the two conditions above , the function @xmath18 was not fully characterized in the original theory . however , in a recent paper  @xcite , using more than 2500 data points in 153 rotationally supported galaxies of different morphologies and gas fractions , the authors found a correlation between the observed and baryonic accelerations that can be interpreted in terms of an interpolating mond formula of the form @xmath19 with the characteristic acceleration found to be @xmath20 .",

    "even if milgrom s modified newtonian dynamics provides a satisfactory phenomenological description of the galactic kinematics , it presents some difficulties when trying to describe objects at different scales . for instance , galaxy observations suggest that @xmath24 , consistent with the value reported in  @xcite , whereas observations in galaxy clusters point to a value that differs by a factor of three or four @xcite , and strong lensing in big galaxies to an even larger value @xcite .",
    "these discrepancies may just signal that one should look at milgrom s fitting formula as an effective description in the appropriate regime , expecting that the underlying modified gravity theory will explain dm beyond the validity of mond .",
    "furthermore , there is an intriguing relation in this phenomenological model , where the characteristic acceleration scale used to explain the rotational curves in galaxies seems to be controlled by the value of the hubble constant today  @xcite .",
    "the link between dark energy ( de ) and dm may be a hint for an emergent phenomenon of the underlying bricks of spacetime .",
    "motivated by all these arguments , erik verlinde has recently proposed that the emergent laws of gravity may contain an additional _ dark _ gravitational term that could replace dm in galaxy observations  @xcite .",
    "then , what we use to identify as dm could be just the inescapable consequence of the presence of standard model particles in those objects .",

    "we compare verlinde s model with the successful phenomenological mond description , and then argue in section  [ sec.results ] that the new theory can fit the velocity dispersions of the eight classical dsph s satellites of the milky way with no further need of an extra dark particle component .",
    "we finally present , in section  [ sec.discussion ] , a brief discussion on the results .",
    "on one hand , classical general relativity is a well developed area of physics .",
    "however , we still lack a fully quantum description of this theory . on the other hand ,",
    "emergent phenomena which has a vague definition in the literature occur in physical and other natural sciences all the time .",
    "the appearance of thermodynamics and hydrodynamics from microscopic states are probably the two notorious cases in physics , but there are many other well known examples that illustrates this situation , such as the van der waals force emerging from non - relativistic quantum electrodynamics  @xcite , or the laws of classical mechanics from quantum theory when applied to large enough systems . among these ideas to understand gravity at the quantum level , one may wonder whether the laws of gravity , and perhaps even the structure of spacetime itself , unfold somehow as a collective result of some unknown microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "this is no longer a new idea .",
    "early work dates back to more than fifty years ago with the proposals of wheeler , finkelstein or sakharov  @xcite , becoming more popular in the last decade with particular connections to the concepts of entropy , entanglement , and the gauge / gravity duality .",
    "this duality , in simple words , states that a field theory without gravity is equivalent to a higher dimensional theory containing gravity , supporting the idea of the gravitational field as an emergent concept .",
    "we refer the reader to the review papers in  @xcite and references within , where different approaches , challenges , and problems of emergent gravity are described in some detail .    among the vast constructions of emergent gravity , which usually break lorentz invariance at the microscopic level",
    ", there is one exception started by the work of ted jacobson in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that work ,",
    "he showed how einstein equations can be recovered from the black hole entropy and the standard concepts of heat , entropy , and temperature in thermodynamics . given that thermodynamics reflects the collective behavior of microstates , this particular perspective of gravity as an entropic force further supports the idea of an emergent spacetime .",
    "this early work was then further explored and generalized by thanu padmanabhan ( see @xcite and references therein ) and verlinde  @xcite , highlighting the deep connection between general relativity and entropy . a key argument in this relationship is the `` area law '' scaling of entropy , as opposed to the usual volume scaling . at the microscopic level",
    ", it is well understood that local interactions with a gapped hamiltonian lead to an area law for the entanglement entropy  @xcite , connecting ideas in black holes ( and thus gravity ) , information theory , and quantum many body physics .    motivated by all these arguments , verlinde  @xcite",
    "has again extended this thermodynamical picture to explain the dark sector , _",
    "cest -  - dire _ the dm and de in our universe . in the new proposal he sketches , without rigorous proofs ,",
    "how the quasi - de sitter ( ds ) spacetime in which we live at the moment ( the de domination phase ) , can be obtained from a not well - specified system of microstates which are coherently excited above the true vacuum .",
    "this ground state , corresponding to a negative cosmological constant anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime , emerges out of the microstates which are fully entangled .",
    "this particular construction could be better understood in terms of a representation of the microstates called the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz ( mera ) tensor network within the gauge / gravity correspondence .",
    "a tensor network uses sites and connections to mathematically reduce the problem of finding the ( vacuum ) state in a system of many quantum particles .",
    "using a coarse graining algorithm one can systematically reduce the number of degrees of freedom at each level . then , after repeating it iteratively , one obtains a network .",
    "this mathematical description of many body physics has turned out to be very effective in studying condensed matter systems , and has the interesting property of developing an effective metric along the network in many cases  @xcite . in the case of the gauge / gravity duality , out of the possible tensor network descriptions , the particular choice of mera develops an effective metric which results in a pure ads when the continuum limit is taken  @xcite .",
    "an important result is how the area law is obtained along this construction .",
    "the microstates are fully locally entangled , so that one can push the relevant information of the tensor network to the boundary of ads .",
    "the relevant degrees of freedom to describe the full network are then those which live in the boundary of a lower dimensional space , which correspond precisely to the field theory in the duality  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one does expect that the microstates ( perhaps of this mera tensor network ) are the building blocks behind the ads ground state .    from the ads ground state",
    ", verlinde argues that one could obtain a ds space ( a vacuum spacetime with the de component only ) , as an excited state over this vacuum with very particular properties . one may expect a thermalized state due to the fact that ds has a horizon , and hence a bekenstein s temperature associated to it . in order to achieve this homogeneous , very low energetic excited state",
    ", one may argue for long range correlations among the microstates , and hence not an area law but a volume scaling entropy .",
    "this volume scaling entropy precisely matches the area law at the cosmological horizon , implying the entropy of de within a spherical region of radius @xmath26 is @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the hubble scale , related to the hubble constant by @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the area enclosing the spherical region .",
    "the de entropy should then be distributed equally among all the states , so that the excitations are delocalized and with a very slow dynamics , inhibiting all possible observation of de in the lab .",
    "one may think that these non - local excitations that construct ds spacetime produce a very stiff structure , but on the contrary the slow dynamics of these states makes it resemble more of an elastic medium .",
    "verlinde uses the theory of elasticity to get predictions , since at the moment there is no clear understanding of the real microstates describing the system .",
    "the idea of gravity being thought in terms of elasticity dates back to the work of sakharov  @xcite , and more recently the possibility of describing ds in terms of an elastic medium was also worked out by padmanabhan in ref .",
    "@xcite , where he even argues how to obtain the value of the observed cosmological constant from this description .",
    "however , the real novelty in verlinde s work is the study of how this ds scheme is affected by the intrusion of a baryonic mass @xmath31 . on one hand ,",
    "the cosmological horizon shrinks by the presence of the mass , reducing the entropy associated to the de , as one can easily get convinced from the schwarszchild - de - sitter solution if the mass is placed near the origin at @xmath32 in the static patch of ds . on the other hand",
    ", this mass will carry a volume - scaling entropy given by @xmath33 , as it can be shown by the effect of the gravitational potential produced by the mass in the geodesic distance .",
    "if we then compare this mass entropy to the entropy lost by the medium by the presence of the mass we get @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the surface density and we have introduced the characteristic acceleration @xmath0 of the de , given by @xmath36 . if @xmath37 , more entropy is removed by the mass and the response to it is governed by the usual laws of einstein s theory without dark fluids . if the opposite is true , @xmath38 , then we are in the low surface density regime and there is a remnant of the de entropy in the volume occupied by the mass , which behaves as an incompressible elastic medium and will affect the gravitational laws associated to the baryonic mass , mimicking dm .",
    "it turns out that @xmath39 corresponds to the largest principle of the elastic medium strain , namely @xmath40 , where is @xmath41 is the strain tensor and @xmath42 is the maximal strain ( unitary ) direction .",
    "therefore , the response of the medium to the mass inclusion can be fully understood in terms of the stress and the strain of the elastic theory .",
    "the elastic linear theory considered by verlinde  @xcite is such that no pressure waves are present and the displacement is produced by a scalar quantity only , namely , the stress tensor @xmath43 obeys @xmath44 .",
    "this corresponds to a theory of gravity with a central force , described by a scalar potential @xmath45 in terms of the elastic medium displacement @xmath46 , and given by @xmath47 .",
    "in order to obtain the main result of ref .",
    "@xcite , eq .",
    "( [ epsilondef ] ) can be though in a different way .",
    "if we are in the dark sector regime , @xmath38 , the observed surface density produced by baryons is given by @xmath48 . from the entropy removed by considering the mass @xmath31 inclusion ,",
    "verlinde arrives to the key equation @xmath49 where the equality is only achieved when the largest principle strain @xmath39 takes its maximal value ( so the perpendicular strains are all equal ) , and the medium response is negligible well outside the mass . in other words ,",
    "observations may only put a lower bound on the parameter @xmath0 , since a larger value can be accommodated by having a smaller elongation ( or compression ) of the elastic medium due to the baryonic mass inclusion .    in the case of a maximal value for the largest principal strain , and assuming further spherical symmetry , we have that @xmath50 , where @xmath51 , and the previous key formula in eq .",
    "( [ generalformula ] ) reduces to our starting point for the analysis in this paper , @xmath52 as stated earlier , the parameter @xmath53 is a characteristic acceleration scale in the theory related to the radius of the ( quasi)-ds universe we seem to inhabit , @xmath54 . using current cosmological observations we obtain @xmath55  @xcite .     and @xmath56 .",
    "the characteristic radius that separates the inner and outer regions is close to the half - light radius , but they do not coincide exactly .",
    "we have used a plummer density profile to model the stellar mass distribution , and the structural parameters reported in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "the maximum difference with respect to the external profile is of about @xmath57 percent , and it seems independent of the galaxy s details , see figure  [ fig : mcvsver ] .",
    "this inner region behavior is expected in general , since the acceleration in verlinde s theory depends on the derivatives of the baryonic mass profile ( see the text for a detailed explanation).,scaledwidth=49.0% ]",
    "baryons and the dm phenomena are highly correlated in this new gravitational picture , and this is a prediction that must be contrasted against observations . for a point particle , or outside and extended massive object , @xmath58 , which translates to @xmath59 from eq .",

    "( [ eq.md ] ) was based on spherical symmetry , which is not fulfilled by baryons in those objects .",
    "furthermore , milgrom s fitting formula is only recovered in the exterior of a massive object , but the new fitting formula differs inside matter distributions , as we discuss in detail in what follows . we should then test the viability of this new expression using astrophysical observations which are in agreement with the hypothesis of the derivation . for recent work on the observability of verlinde s model",

    "one may wonder how verlinde s model differs from mond for spherical objects . at this point",

    "again the results are shown in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "note that relaxing the value of @xmath0 improves the stellar mass - to - light ratios found , and that the values of @xmath91 in both tests are consistent , pointing to no degeneracy with other parameters . as an example",
    ", we show in figure  [ fig : test2 ] the posterior distribution of the three parameters ( the acceleration scale , the anisotropy , and the stellar mass - to - light ratio ) for fornax and sculpture .",
    "we observe that the theoretical value of the acceleration parameter @xmath55 ( blue line reference in figure  [ fig : test2 ] ) is consistent at 2-@xmath97 level for all galaxies .",
    "moreover , it is worth noticing that all galaxies show a strong degeneracy between the acceleration parameter and the stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "in particular fornax exhibits a bimodality , see figure  [ fig : test2 ] , but all galaxies are now consistent with @xmath98 .",
    "this strong degeneracy may drive @xmath90 to lower values , hence observationally preferred , by increasing the value of @xmath0 from the theoretical one .",
    "as we mentioned before , this could be allowed by the model as we do not know the real deformation pattern of the elastic medium by the presence of the dsph galaxies .",
    "we have also corroborated the prediction we made at the beginning of this section for the difference between verlinde s and mond mass - to - light ratio required for each model to fit the data .",
    "this was verified numerically by performing the fits as described in this section , for the same plummer profile , but with the mass profile determined by mond theory and with fixed acceleration parameter @xmath0 . a different analysis for the dsph",
    "s kinematics within mond was made in ref .",
    "@xcite , where different key assumptions were made . in particular ,",
    "the author considered a king profile with an anisotropic function @xmath91 which is not constant but linear in the radial variable .",
    "while the density profile may not change drastically from our analysis , the non - constant @xmath91 could hide deviations in the mass - to - light ratio with respect to our fittings",
    ". however , even after considering these issues , the author of @xcite finds higher mass - to - light ratios than ours , where only two cases have @xmath99 , in agreement with the expected result of a higher values than in verlinde s proposal , as we have argued here .",
    "finally , we do not attempt to scrutinize the details of both studies , since we believe comparing verlinde s model to mond should be a carried under the same assumptions , as we have done here .",
    "in this paper we have explored the consequences of a model that proposes that spacetime emerges as the result of the entanglement structure of an underlying microscopic theory .",
    "however , apart from some sketches of how it may look like , there is not such a concrete construction of the microscopic theory . driven by arguments",
    ", erick verlinde has recently argued that an effective theory can capture the key ingredients of the relevant microscopic degrees of freedom to describe the dm phenomena  @xcite .",
    "this effective model is simply the theory of linear elasticity , where the dm component appears as a memory effect of the medium due to the presence of the standard model of particles . at this level",
    ", one may even forget about the microscopic derivation , and consider the elastic theory as the concrete proposal behind dm .    for spherically symmetric isolated massive objects , and assuming further an elastic - medium response of maximal deformation",
    ", verlinde identifies the expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq.md ] ) as codifying the correction to the the baryonic mass profile @xmath9 for the observed gravitational field , @xmath77 . outside the mass ,",
    "we can simply look at this theory as a particular realization of mond . we identify that in the exterior limit the deviation of verlinde s theory with respect to the recently proposed interpolation function of mcgaugh _ et al _",
    "@xcite is never larger than 30 percent , marginally accepted by their observations .",
    "however , within the interior part of a massive object , the gravitational field clearly departs from that of mond .",
    "the key difference is that verlinde s interpolating function contains a radial derivative of the mass profile .",
    "therefore , only a very particular mass profile in verlinde s theory will reduce to mcgaugh s interpolation formula .",
    "none of the common density models used to describe galaxies in a cosmological framework is expected to be such a special case . in particular , for a plummer density profile one finds up to a 50 percent relative difference with respect to the external region in the interior of dsph galaxies .",
    "one should never forget that physics is an experimental discipline , and only observations can decide if a model is correct or not . by following this line of thought",
    ", in this paper we just took the expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq.md ] ) for the spherically symmetric apparent mass distribution for granted , and show that this effective model can describe the internal kinematics of the eight classical dsph satellites of the milky way without postulating any kind of dark component . in the analysis we found a degeneracy between the acceleration parameter , @xmath0 , and the mass - to - light ratio , @xmath90 , which drives @xmath90 to values larger than expected as we approach the theoretical value of @xmath100 .    if one considers eq .",
    "( [ eq.md ] ) as a phenomenological model to describe dm , and forgets about the elastic medium , the derivation assumptions , or the microstates motivation , then one could argue that verlinde s proposal has a mild tension in the fittings , as we have shown in our table  [ tab : results ] , test 1 , due to the marginally unacceptable high values of @xmath90 .",
    "however , once we get back to the assumptions of the elastic medium , we find that a maximal deformation was considered . by relaxing this condition , which is encoded in eq .",
    "( [ generalformula ] ) , the acceleration scale @xmath0 as free parameter can capture the information about the non - maximal deformation of the elastic medium , which will translate on a larger value than the theoretical one , due to the inequality sign of ( [ generalformula ] ) , and in agreement with our findings .",
    "other astrophysical and modeling systematics could be getting into preferring a higher value of @xmath0 than @xmath101 , but this is beyond our present expectations  @xcite .",
    "it is important to say that we have not , in any sense , confronted this hypothesis against the standard dm one .    in order to improve future analysis of the study presented here , it is important to stress the nature of all the different assumptions made within this work .",
    "we considered that dsph galaxies can be described as isolated objects with spherical symmetry .",
    "of course these systems are not really isolated , due to their proximity to the milky way .",
    "we have compared the values of the exterior gravitational field due to the milky way , @xmath102 , to that of verlinde s model , @xmath2 . in order to estimate",
    "@xmath102 one would need the complete theory , but we can argue that @xmath103 , where the upper bound represents the terminal velocity of objects orbiting in the milky way in the galactic plane at a distance @xmath104 to the center of the galaxy . in table  [",
    "tab : results ] we report the ratio @xmath105 , with @xmath106 , and find that it is always ( apart from sextans , which does not pose any other problem ) negligible at the level of the precision obtained by our fittings . on the other hand , these spheroidal systems are not really spherical , but they are the highly dm - dominated objects for which such an assumption is best justified , since the radial averaged ellipticity for the for the eight galaxies is @xmath107 , with a maximum of @xmath108 ( except for umi that is @xmath109 )  @xcite .    to conclude , we have shown how verlinde s emergent gravity model and mond predict very different relations in the @xmath2 vs @xmath5 plane for spherically symmetric configurations , which may help discriminate between both proposals .",
    "in particular , we have studied in detail the inner configuration of dsph satellites of the milky way . however ,",
    "more precision in both , stellar kinematics and mass - to - light ratio , are required in order to favor one model over the other at the dsph s scales . as well more theoretical work is needed so that one can consider non - spherically symmetric objects .",

    "the mass distribution of baryons in a dsph can be read from the standard formula @xmath110 , once the stellar mass density profile @xmath111 is specified . for the case of a plummer profile  ( [ eq.3density ] ) the apparent dm mass in verlinde s theory , @xmath112 from eq .",
