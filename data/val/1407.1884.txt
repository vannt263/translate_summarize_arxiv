    ". the transitions @xmath28 and @xmath29 , corresponding to death at a doubly occupied site , occur at rate @xmath3 .",
    "the set of transition rates defined above describes a pair of contact processes inhabiting the same lattice . if @xmath30 the two processes evolve independently , but for @xmath0 they interact _ symbiotically _ since the annihilation rates are reduced at sites with both species present .",
    "the phase diagram of the 2scp exhibits four phases : ( i ) the fully active phase with nonzero populations of both species ; ( ii ) a partly active phase with only @xmath16 species ; ( iii ) a partly active phase with only @xmath21 species ; ( iv ) the inactive phase in which both species are extinct .",
    "the latter is absorbing while the partly active phases represent absorbing subspaces of the dynamics .",
    "extensive simulations on rings and on the square lattice indicate that the critical behavior is compatible with the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class ; this conclusion is also supported by field - theoretic arguments @xcite .    in @xcite , we studied the model with symmetrical rates under exchange of species labels a and b , i.e. , with @xmath31 .",
    "we found that for @xmath0 the transition from the fully active to the absorbing phase occurs at some @xmath32 , since the annihilation rate is reduced .",

    "for @xmath60 , however , the expression is already positive for @xmath61 , and there is a _ discontinuous _ transition at this point .    in the limit @xmath62 , we expect @xmath63 , as is required by the condition that , in this limit , a time - independent solution requires that the coefficient of @xmath4 in eq .",
    "[ pab ] be zero .",
    "as noted above , the discontinuous phase transition predicted by one- and two - site mft is impossible in one dimension .",
    "simulations in both one and two dimensions , covering a broad range of @xmath3 values , yield no evidence of a discontinuous transition . here we attempt to develop more reliable theoretical descriptions , using cluster approximations and quasistationary ( qs ) solutions of small systems , for the symmetric case , @xmath64 . in the following analysis we set @xmath53 , i.e. , the non - diffusive limit of eqs . 1 - 4 .",
    "it is often the case that mft predictions improve , both qualitatively and quantitatively , as the cluster size used in the analysis is increased .",
    "we therefore investigate mft approximations using clusters of up to six sites in one dimension , and clusters of four sites on the square lattice . following the usual procedure @xcite",
    ", we deduce a set of coupled , nonlinear differential equations for the cluster occupation probabilities , which are then integrated numerically to obtain the stationary solution . as shown in fig .",
    "[ lm1d ] , for the one - dimensional case , the prediction for the phase boundary in the @xmath2 plane does improve as we increase the cluster size from @xmath65 to @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath65 approximation correctly predicts a continuous phase transition for @xmath67 , but on this range it yields @xmath6 independent of @xmath3 , contrary to simulations , which show @xmath6 varying smoothly with @xmath3 . for @xmath66",

    "( note that on the latter interval @xmath6 is again independent of @xmath3 ) .",
    "thus the @xmath66 approximation exhibits the same qualitative problems as for @xmath65 , despite the overall improvement .",
    "the four - site approximation on the square lattice , shown in fig .",
    "[ lm2d ] , furnishes a reasonable prediction for the phase boundary , but suffers from similar defects : for @xmath71 the transition is discontinuous , while for @xmath72 , @xmath6 is independent of @xmath3 .    in the context of absorbing - state phase transitions ,",
    "we generally look to mft as a guide to the overall phase diagram , expecting the critical point to have the correct order of magnitude and , perhaps more importantly , the nature ( continuous or discontinuous ) of the transition to be predicted correctly .",
    "the latter criterion is not always satisfied , however @xcite . in light of this , and in the hope of devising a more reliable approximation method that is still relatively simple to apply , we consider analyses based on the quasistationary ( qs ) probability distribution of small systems .",
    "the qs distribution ( or _ yaglom limit _ , as it is known in the probability literature ) , is the probability distribution at long times , conditioned on survival of the process @xcite .",
    "for the one - dimensional cp and allied models @xcite , and an activated random walker model @xcite , finite - size scaling analysis of numerically exact qs results on a sequence of lattice sizes yields good estimates for the critical point , exponents and moment ratios . in the present case , with four states per site , attaining the sizes required for a precise analysis appears to be very costly , computationally , and we shall merely attempt to obtain reasonable estimates for the phase boundary @xmath73 .    as described in detail in @xcite , obtaining the qs distribution numerically requires ( 1 ) enumerating all configurations on a lattice of a given size ; ( 2 ) enumerating all transitions between configurations , and their associated rates ; and ( 3 ) using this information in an iterative procedure to generate the qs distribution .",
    "once the latter is known , one may calculate properties such as the order parameter or lifetime . for small systems",
    "these quantities are smooth functions of the control parameter and show no hint of the critical singularity .",
    "it is known , however , that the moment ratio @xmath74 exhibits crossings , analogous to those of the binder cumulant @xcite .",

    "therefore , is to calculate @xmath79 for a series of sizes @xmath80 , locate the crossings @xmath76 , and use them to estimate @xmath6 .",
    "in one dimension we calculate @xmath79 for rings of size @xmath81 to 11 .",
    "we treat configurations with only one species as absorbing , as well as , naturally , the configuration devoid of any individuals . to estimate @xmath6 we perform a quadratic fit to @xmath76 as a function of @xmath82 , using @xmath83 in the range 1 - 3 .",
    "( the precise value of @xmath83 is chosen so as to render the plot of @xmath84 versus @xmath82 as close to linear as possible . )",
    "similar estimates for @xmath6 are obtained using the bulirsch - stoer procedure @xcite . as is evident in fig .",

    "the extrapolated value of @xmath86 at the crossings is not particularly good ( for @xmath30 we find @xmath87 , compared with the best estimate of 1.1736(1 ) @xcite ) .",
    "although we expect that this would improve using larger systems , our objective here is to find a relatively fast and simple method to predict the phase boundary .",
    "( the cpu time required to converge to the qs distribution is comparable to that required to integrate the equations numerically in the @xmath66 cluster approximation . )    to apply the qs method to the two - dimensional 2scp , we devised an algorithm that enumerates configurations and transitions for a general graph of @xmath88 vertices ; the graph structure is specified by the set of bonds @xmath89 linking pairs of vertices @xmath90 and @xmath91 . to represent a portion of the square lattice , with periodic boundaries , each vertex must be linked to four others .",
    "this can be achieved rather naturally for a square ( @xmath92 ) or rectangle ( @xmath93 ) ; for other values of @xmath88 we use a cluster close to a square , and define the bonds required for periodicity by tiling the plane with this cluster , as shown in fig .",

    "we instead derive estimates for the critical point by locating the maximum of @xmath97 , since in the infinite - size limit , this derivative ( taken from the left ) diverges at the critical point .",

    "this analysis suggests that the phase transition is continuous ( as found in simulation ) since the qs probability distribution is unimodal in all cases .",
    "although the one - site mft predicts a discontinuous phase transition in the 2scp in any number of dimensions , such a transition is not possible in one - dimensional systems with short - range interactions and free of boundary fields @xcite . in one dimension",
    "the active - absorbing transition should be continuous , as we have indeed verified in simulations . in two dimensions ( @xmath7 )",
    ", previous studies did not reveal any evidence for a discontinuous transition .",
    "these studies did not , however , include diffusion , which is expected to facilitate the appearance of discontinuous transitions . here",
    "we study the 2scp with diffusion on the square lattice .",
    "we modify the process so that , in addition to creation and death , each individual can hop to one of its nn sites at rate @xmath4 . in the simulation algorithm for the diffusive 2scp , we maintain two lists , one of singly and another of doubly occupied sites .",
