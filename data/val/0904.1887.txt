    "the scenario of cosmological inflation @xcite was designed to address several puzzles of the standard cosmology , most of them connected with the property of large - scale homogeneity , isotropy and flatness of the observable universe .",
    "it was also realized that an inflationary epoch can explain the origin of primordial density perturbations @xcite .",
    "specifically , quantum fluctuations of the inflaton and metric fields , being blown up by inflation , acquire quasiclassical features on large ( super - hubble ) spatial scales .",
    "the predictions of the inflationary theory  most notably , the spatial flatness of the universe and adiabatic primordial perturbations with almost scale - invariant spectrum  are surprisingly well verified by modern observations of the large - scale structure ( lss ) and cosmic microwave background(cmb ) .",
    "primordial perturbations which serve as primeval seeds for the formation of the observable structure are generated at the late stages of inflation ( the last 60 or so @xmath0-foldings ) .",
    "however , depending on a concrete realization of the inflationary scenario , the inflationary stage can be rather long , in principle , starting right from the largest classically allowable energy density , the planck density .",
    "the total number of inflationary @xmath0-foldings can be enormous , with typical values @xmath1 in the scenario of chaotic inflation .",
    "it is clear that generation of super - hubble scalar and tensor perturbations with quasiclassical features can not be considered as specific to the last stage of inflation , but that this process should occur all along the inflationary history .",
    "this observation is the basis for the theory of the self - regenerating eternal inflationary universe @xcite .",
    "thus one is lead to the idea that the inflationary universe at all times should be inhomogeneous on super - hubble spatial scales .",
    "it then makes sense to take this long - wave ( super - hubble ) _ quasiclassical inhomogeneity _ into account when considering the evolution of small - scale ( sub - hubble ) quantum fluctuations on the background of an inflationary universe . propagating with speed of light , the small - scale quantum fluctuations travel about a hubble distance in a hubble time , thus passing through inhomogeneities on a hubble spatial scale during inflation .",
    "the background inhomogeneity affects the evolution of the small - scale modes determining the vacuum state and , as was shown in our previous publications @xcite , the resulting power spectrum of primordial perturbations acquires _ statistical anisotropy _ of quite specific form .",
    "namely , the correlation function , say , of the relativistic potential @xmath2 at the end of inflation is expressed as @xmath3 where @xmath4 describes the standard isotropic power spectrum , and @xmath5 is a new anisotropic correction , which turns out to be almost scale - invariant .",
    "specifically , its multipole expansion is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the spectral index of scalar perturbations ( which is known to be close to unity ) , and the quantities @xmath8 depend on @xmath9 very weakly .",
    "moreover , the expression ( [ cs-2 ] ) is essentially dominated by the first term , with quadrupole dependence on the unit vector @xmath10 .    in deriving the result ( [ cs-1 ] ) , only _",
    "scalar _ quasiclassical background inhomogeneities during inflation were taken into account in @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of such inhomogeneities in terms of the relativistic gravitational potential is estimated to be . ]",
    "@xmath11 ( here , @xmath12 is the newton s gravitational constant , and @xmath13 is the hubble parameter ) .",
    "however , inflation also produces _ tensor _ perturbations @xcite with magnitude @xmath14 on super - hubble scales , which is higher than @xmath15 especially at the early stages of inflation , where @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , tensor inhomogeneities of the background of the inflationary universe also necessarily must be taken into account , and this will be the subject of the present paper . we will show that the results ( [ cs-1 ] ) and ( [ cs-2 ] ) for the spectrum of primordial scalar perturbations remain to be valid ; however , in most interesting cases , a major contribution to the quantity @xmath5 comes from the _ tensor _ inhomogeneities of the background of the inflationary universe .",
    "we will see that the expected magnitude of the anisotropic part ( [ cs-2 ] ) crucially depends on the moment of time where one sets the initial ( vacuum ) conditions for the quantum fluctuations of interest at the inflationary state .",
    "the earlier this moment is , the larger is the number of inhomogeneous quasiclassical modes that have affected the evolution of the small - scale quantum fluctuations , hence , the larger is the expected statistical anisotropy .",
    "this gives rise to an important issue that was first discussed in @xcite .",
    "it was observed that the physical wave number or frequency of a particular quantum mode in the cosmological frame exceeds the planck value @xmath17 during most part of the inflationary universe .",
    "a natural question arises , whether it is legitimate to use the standard field theory in cosmology on spatial scales below the planck length .",
    "recently , this _ trans - planckian issue _ has become a subject of discussion in connection with the possible modification of the form of ( statistically isotropic ) primordial power spectrum @xcite and cosmological particle creation @xcite .",
    "we will present several arguments from the literature in favor of the possibility of dealing with the trans - planckian region in cosmology .",
    "if the trans - planckian issue can be safely ignored , then , as we will see , the statistical anisotropy can be significant , with the dominant term @xmath18 being up to the order of unity .",
    "if , however , one is allowed to specify locally homogeneous and isotropic initial conditions for quantum modes only after the planck - radius crossing , then the resulting statistical anisotropy is rather small , @xmath19 .",
    "statistical anisotropy of the power spectrum of primordial scalar perturbations will be manifest in the lss and cmb .",
    "the first effect was already discussed in our previous paper @xcite , while the statistical anisotropy of the cmb was a subject of a number of recent studies @xcite .",
    "we will briefly describe the arising effects in the present paper .",
    "our work represents a theoretical contribution to the issue of the possible origin of statistical anisotropy in the universe ( see @xcite for other ideas on this subject ) .",
    "the predictions made in this paper have an advantage of being based on the usual theory of chaotic inflation without any additional physical ingredients .",
    "observation of statistical anisotropy in the scale - invariant form ( [ cs-2 ] ) may thus be regarded as a nontrivial confirmation of the chaotic inflation scenario ; this is the only possible test of chaotic inflation that we are aware of . on the other hand , since the magnitude of the statistical anisotropy depends on both the details of the inflationary scenario and the physical assumptions about the trans - planckian region , its nondetection by itself will not invalidate any of the existing models of inflation .",

    "however , it will be more convenient to use the variable @xmath36 in the high - frequency region . using constraint ( [ con3 ] )",
    ", one can see from ( [ v ] ) that @xmath50 in this region , so that the two variables are simply related .",
    "one can describe this fact as insignificance of the self - gravity of the inflaton field in the high - frequency region .",
    "in this case , the appropriately normalized positive - frequency modes for the inflaton field have the form @xmath51 the expression for the modes of the relativistic potential @xmath52 in the high - frequency region are then obtained using equation ( [ con3 ] ) : @xmath53 here we used the fact that the value of @xmath54 changes slowly with conformal time relative to the frequency @xmath55 ( during the slow - roll regime , it varies slowly with time even relative to @xmath13 ) .",
    "a more careful analysis of equation ( [ phi ] ) shows that the approximate solution ( [ phi - small ] ) is , in fact , valid in a somewhat broader range of wave numbers , namely , for @xmath56 ( we remember that @xmath57 during inflation ) .",

    "taking into account equation ( [ class - doth ] ) , one can see that ( [ phi - small ] ) is a good approximate solution of ( [ psi ] ) , ( [ eq - psi ] ) in the domain @xmath56 .",
    "then , using ( [ con2 ] ) and the slow - roll condition , we can write the approximate solutions for the modes valid in a broader frequency range as follows : @xmath62    the fourier amplitude of the solution of equation ( [ phi ] ) can also conveniently be written as @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are some time - dependent functions .",

    "the property of the quantum state allows one to speak about the generation of a quasiclassical field condensate on large spatial scales ( see @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the equal - time correlation function , say , for the perturbations of the inflaton field , is given by @xmath121 where @xmath122 are the physical wave number and physical distance , respectively .",
    "the first term in the brackets of ( [ correlat ] ) corresponds to the usual quantum fluctuations in the flat space .",
    "the second term , from the viewpoint of flat space , can be interpreted as the presence of particles with occupation numbers @xmath123 leading to nonzero correlation in ( [ correlat ] ) for exponentially large physical distances @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the scale factor at the beginning of inflation .",
    "the behavior of the quasiclassical part of the inflaton @xmath20 in the inflationary universe can be described in terms of brownian motion induced by conversion of quantum fluctuations of the field @xmath20 into quasiclassical inhomogeneities .",
    "the probability distribution of the local value of the inflaton field obeys an effective diffusion equation ( see @xcite for the development of this theory ) .    at the end of inflation , perturbations on super - hubble spatial scales constitute the primordial density perturbations .",
    "it is usually assumed that they represent a realization of a _ classical _ gaussian random field described by the correlation function ( [ correlat ] ) and accompanied by the corresponding _ classical _ perturbations in the relativistic potential @xmath2 .",
    "the mechanism of this transition  from the quantum state that does not break the symmetries of the background space to a classical state that obviously breaks these symmetries  remains to be an open issue .",
    "it is presumably related to the problem of collapse of wave function , hence , to the deep interpretational issues of quantum mechanics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear that the generation of scalar and tensor perturbations on super - hubble spatial scales that subsequently behave quasiclassically is not restricted specifically to the last stage of inflation , where it is supposed to produce the primordial seeds for the subsequent formation of large - scale structure and primordial gravity waves , but that this process occurs all along the inflationary history .",
    "therefore , the quasiclassical parts of @xmath2 and @xmath126 are permanently generated during inflation constituting a ( random ) inhomogeneity and anisotropy of the inflationary universe .",
    "it thus makes sense to make the next step in the perturbation theory and consider the evolution of short - wave ( @xmath49 ) perturbations ( to become the observable large - scale structure ) on the background of the long - wave ( @xmath127 ) quasiclassical inhomogeneities permanently generated during inflation . in order to set up a valid theoretical background for this procedure ,",
    "we need to address the issue of the evolution of the inhomogeneous inflationary universe .",
    "this is the subject of the present subsection .",
    "because of the permanent generation of classical long - wave perturbations and their subsequent evolution , the inflationary universe considered as a whole may be very inhomogeneous , its different spatially remote parts having quite different histories .",
    "indeed , the dispersion of the inhomogeneity of the classical inflaton field generated during one hubble time is equal to @xmath128 according to ( [ correlat ] ) . at early stages of inflation ,",
    "a typical random change of the inflaton can be larger than its regular change @xmath129 caused by slow rolling ; a criterion for this property is @xmath130 , or @xmath131 for the scalar - field potential ( [ potential ] ) , this condition becomes @xmath132 which is considerably higher than the inflationary boundary ( [ criterion ] ) but still lower than the boundary of the planckian energy density @xmath133 in view of ( [ amplitude ] ) : @xmath134    if the inflaton field is above the threshold given by ( [ threshold1 ] ) or ( [ threshold2 ] ) , then its value has a significant chance to increase with time due to the mechanism of quantum fluctuations described above .",
    "this random behavior of the classical part of the inflaton field leads to a picture of eternal self - regenerating inflation @xcite .",
    "one of the consequences of this picture is that the inflationary universe _ as a whole _ can not be split into a homogeneous and isotropic background and a _ small _ classical perturbation because very soon one has to deal with perturbations with relative amplitudes larger than unity , which are impossible to treat in a perturbative way .    to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we will follow the history of a _ spatially bounded domain _ of the inflationary universe choosing its variable comoving size to be conveniently larger than the size of the horizon at every moment of time and , on the other hand , not very large , so that inhomogeneity within this domain can still be treated as small .",
    "this approach was also adopted in @xcite .",
    "specifically , in terms of the original coordinates @xmath135 , at every moment of time , we deal with a domain of comoving size @xmath136 , where the constant @xmath137 , i.e. , a domain well exceeding the hubble size . within this domain , at every moment of time , we can split the quasiclassical perturbations generated during inflation into the spatially homogeneous parts @xmath138 and @xmath139 and the remaining parts with zero spatial average , which we denote by @xmath140 and @xmath141 ( endowing them with the subscript or superscript `` @xmath142 '' ) . after that , we eliminate the homogeneous parts @xmath138 and @xmath139 , depending only on time , by making the transformation of coordinates and of the scale factor within the domain under consideration as follows .",

    "in fact , _ statistical inhomogeneity _ in our theory would be obtained in the next order of expansion of the phases in ( [ cf ] ) in powers of @xmath171 and @xmath362 , and one can show that this effect is very small .",
    "specifically , the spatial variance of the quantity @xmath5 can be estimated as @xmath363 .",
    "even if one takes the comoving length @xmath364 as large as the size of the observable universe , @xmath365  mpc , and comoving scale @xmath9 as large as @xmath366 , one gets the estimate @xmath367 .",
    "in particular , this implies that our theory by itself does not predict any significant dipole modulation of the cmb power spectrum , which is suggested to explain the observational evidence of the hemispherical power asymmetry in the wmap data @xcite ( see @xcite for a recent discussion of this issue )",
    ". however , the quadrupole modulation of the cmb sky , which is present in our theory , together with anisotropy in cmb data ( caused , e.g. , by the cut - sky masks used to exclude foregrounds , see @xcite ) , might be responsible for this effect .",
    "indeed , in this case , effectively nonantipodal regions of the sky may be involved in the comparison of the power spectra of two antipodal hemispheres , and then the quadrupole asymmetry may produce the effect of antipodal asymmetry . in our case ,",
    "the effect is described by an almost scale - independent traceless matrix @xmath18 , hence , it is expected to exhibit universal axes of asymmetry for statistical anisotropy on all angular scales .",
    "this question remains to be investigated in all detail .",
    "in this paper , we considered the evolution of small - scale quantum fluctuations on the background of an inhomogeneous inflationary universe and calculated the resulting primordial power spectrum . the background metric inhomogeneities during inflation are generated in a self - consistent way on super - hubble spatial scales .",
    "we have seen that the resulting power spectrum of scalar primordial perturbations acquires the statistically anisotropic part and can be put in the form ( [ cs-1 ] ) , ( [ cs-2 ] ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath18 and @xmath368 in ( [ cs-2 ] ) very weakly depend on the wave number @xmath9 .",
    "being a result of metric inhomogeneities generated during inflation , they represent gaussian random variables with zero average ; in our universe , we observe only one particular realization of these quantities , hence , we can only speak about their statistical properties .",
    "the variance ( which characterizes the expected magnitude ) of the statistical anisotropy crucially depends on the moment of time at which one specifies the initial conditions for the modes describing the vacuum state .",
    "it is here that we encounter the trans - planckian issue , which we discussed in sec .",
    "[ trans ] .",
    "if one specifies locally homogeneous and isotropic initial conditions for quantum modes at the moment of planck - radius crossing , then the statistical anisotropy which we are talking about turns out to be very small , with variance @xmath314 .",
    "however , one can argue in favor of the possibility of working in the trans - planckian domain of wave numbers ( assuming exact local lorentz invariance ) and specify the initial conditions much earlier along the inflationary epoch . in this case",
    ", the expected value of the statistical anisotropy can be appreciable ; our perturbative approach breaks down at the values @xmath369 ; in reality , the anisotropy might be considerably higher and might be detectable .    where the statistical anisotropy is sufficiently high , it is mainly caused by the influence from the background metric inhomogeneities of tensor type . in this case , the full traces of the tensors @xmath18 and @xmath368 in ( [ cs-2 ] ) are equal to zero , and the ratio of the corresponding variances is estimated in ( [ quaddom ] ) to be @xmath370    the specific scale - invariant form",
    "( [ cs-2 ] ) , dominated by the quadrupole term , might facilitate the search for the predicted statistical anisotropy in the large - scale structure and cosmic microwave background .",
    "its detection may be regarded as another nontrivial confirmation of the chaotic inflation scenario and elucidate some aspects of the trans - planckian issue .",

    "the last term in ( [ nut1 ] ) , containing the derivative @xmath390 , arises from the jacobian ( [ jacob ] ) as a result of the dependence of @xmath182 on the time @xmath209 .",
    "this term is also much smaller than the second , leading term in ( [ nut1 ] ) , which should be clear from the fact that it is of higher order in the expansion parameter @xmath391 .",
    "one can calculate the variance of this term to find that it is of the order @xmath392 .",
    "thus , we should drop this term as well from the correction to the power spectrum .",
    "eventually , we get our result ( [ nut ] ) .",
    "quite similarly , one obtains contribution ( [ nus ] ) from the phase @xmath217 . the local quantity @xmath140 , which is analogous to @xmath388 in ( [ nut1 ] ) , as well as the expression similar to the last term in ( [ nut1 ] ) are both much smaller than the leading term ( [ nus ] ) .",
    "in principle , expression ( [ intermed ] ) for the correlation function should be revised in view of the fact that the spatial coordinates @xmath171 entering the metric at the end of inflation are not exactly euclidean because of the presence of the large - scale quasiclassical inhomogeneities in metric ( [ metric - c ] ) . however , proceeding to the euclidean coordinates will generate additional local terms of the form and order of @xmath140 and @xmath388 in the anisotropic part of the correlation function , which thus also can be neglected .",
