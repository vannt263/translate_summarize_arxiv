    "the coulomb potential of a point electric charge in a 1 + 1 dimension , considered as the time component of a lorentz vector , is linear ( @xmath0 ) and so it provides a constant electric field always pointing to , or from , the point charge .",
    "this problem is related to the confinement of fermions in the schwinger and in the massive schwinger models @xcite-@xcite and in the thirring - schwinger model @xcite .",
    "it is frustrating that , due to the tunneling effect ( klein 's paradox ) , there are no bound states for this kind of potential regardless of the strength of the potential @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the linear potential , considered as a lorentz scalar , is also related to the quarkonium model in one - plus - one dimensions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently it was incorrectly concluded that even in this case there is solely one bound state @xcite .",
    "later , the proper solutions for this last problem were found @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , it is well known from the quarkonium phenomenology in the real 3 + 1 dimensional world that the best fit for meson spectroscopy is found for a convenient mixture of vector and scalar potentials put by hand in the equations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the same can be said about the treatment of the nuclear phenomena describing the influence of the nuclear medium on the nucleons @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the mixed vector - scalar potential has also been analyzed in 1 + 1 dimensions for a linear potential @xcite as well as for a general potential which goes to infinity as @xmath1 @xcite . in both of those last references",
    "it has been concluded that there is confinement if the scalar coupling is of sufficient intensity compared to the vector coupling .",
    "although the vector coulomb potential does not hold relativistic bound - state solutions , its screened version ( @xmath2 ) is a genuine binding potential and its solutions have been found for fermions @xcite .",
    "the screened coulomb potential has also been analyzed with a scalar coupling in the dirac equation @xcite as well as in the klein - gordon equation with vector @xcite and scalar @xcite couplings .",
    "the confinement of fermions by a pseudoscalar double - step potential @xcite and their scattering by a pseudoscalar step potential @xcite have already been analyzed in the literature providing the opportunity to find some quite interesting results .",
    "indeed , the two - dimensional version of the anomalous magnetic - like interaction linear in the radial coordinate , christened by moshinsky and szczepaniak @xcite as dirac oscillator , has also received attention . nogami and toyama @xcite , toyama et al .",
    "@xcite and toyama and nogami @xcite studied the behaviour of wave packets under the influence of that conserving - parity potential whereas szmytkowski and gruchowski @xcite proved the completeness of the eigenfunctions .",

    "we begin our presentation of the dirac equation with the most general potential in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "this general approach allows us to show that the pseudoscalar potential has a clearly different behaviour when compared with the scalar and vector potentials , even in the nonrelativistic limit of the theory .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the problem of a fermion under the influence of a pseudoscalar potential can always be mapped into a sturm - liouville problem for the upper and lower components of the dirac spinor .",
    "following that same methodology the present paper shows that the screened coulomb potential plus a uniform background potential gives rise to an effective morse - like potential , in the same way as the generalized dirac oscillator plus an inversely linear potential gives rise to an effective quadratic plus inversely quadratic potential @xcite .",
    "the exact bounded solutions are found , such as in ref .",
    "@xcite , by transforming the sturm - liouville problem into kummer s equation and expressing the upper and the lower components of the dirac spinor in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions .",
    "in addition to their intrinsic importance as a new solution of the dirac equation , this problem highlights the essential role of the uniform background potential in furnishing bounded solutions and it might be relevant to studies of binding of neutral fermions by electric fields . furthermore , the result renders a new contrast to the result found in ref . @xcite . in the nonrelativistic quantum mechanics , the problem of a particle subject to the morse potential ( @xmath9 ^{2}$ ] ) has been used to describe the vibrations of nuclei in homonuclear diatomic molecules @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this sort of problem for s - wave states is transformed into the problem of solving a transcendent equation which is only approximately solvable @xcite-@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the one - dimensional asymmetric morse potential ( @xmath10 ) is an exactly solvable problem in the nonrelativistic quantum mechanics @xcite-@xcite , even if its parameters are complex numbers @xcite .",
    "thee 1 + 1 dimensional time - independent dirac equation for a fermion of rest mass @xmath11 reads @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the energy of the fermion , @xmath14 is the velocity of light and @xmath15 is the momentum operator .",

    "this is the most general combination of lorentz structures for the potential matrix because there are only four linearly independent 2@xmath222 matrices .",
    "the subscripts for the terms of potential denote their properties under a lorentz transformation : @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the time and space components of the 2-vector potential , @xmath26 and @xmath15 for the scalar and pseudoscalar terms , respectively .",
    "it is worth to note that the dirac equation is covariant under @xmath27 if @xmath28 and @xmath29 change sign whereas @xmath30 and @xmath31 remain the same .",
    "this is because the parity operator @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a constant phase and @xmath34 changes @xmath35 into @xmath36 , changes sign of @xmath37 and @xmath38 but not of @xmath21 and @xmath39 .    defining @xmath40    the space component of the vector potential",

    "provided that the spinor is written in terms of the upper and the lower components @xmath43    the dirac equation decomposes into :    @xmath44    where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath35 . in terms of @xmath45 and",
    "@xmath46 the spinor is normalized as @xmath47 so that @xmath45 and @xmath46 are square integrable functions .",
    "it is clear from the pair of coupled first - order differential equations ( [ eq8b ] ) that both @xmath45 and @xmath46 have definite and opposite parities if the dirac equation is covariant under @xmath27 .    in the nonrelativistic approximation (",
    "potential energies small compared to @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) eq . ( [ eq8b ] ) becomes    @xmath50",

    "it is remarkable that the dirac equation with a nonvector potential , or a vector potential contaminated with some scalar or pseudoscalar coupling , is not invariant under @xmath53const , this is so because only the vector potential couples to the positive - energies in the same way it couples to the negative - ones , whereas nonvector contaminants couple to the mass of the fermion .",
    "therefore , if there is any nonvector coupling the absolute values of the energy will have physical significance and the freedom to choose a zero - energy will be lost .",
    "this last statement remains truthfully in the nonrelativistic limit if one considers that such a contaminant is a pseudoscalar potential .",
    "it is also noticeable that the pseudoscalar coupling results in the schrdinger equation with an effective potential in the nonrelativistic limit , and not with the original potential itself .",
    "indeed , this is the side effect which in a 3 + 1 dimensional space - time makes the linear potential to manifest itself as a harmonic oscillator plus a strong spin - orbit coupling in the nonrelativistic limit @xcite .",
    "the form in which the original potential appears in the effective potential , the @xmath54 term , allows us to infer that even a potential unbounded from below could be a confining potential .",
    "this phenomenon is inconceivable if one starts with the original potential in the nonrelativistic equation .    as we will see explicitly in the next section ,",
    "a constant added to the pseudoscalar coulomb potential is undoubtedly physically relevant . as a matter of fact",
    ", it plays a crucial role to ensure the existence of bounded solutions .",
    "nevertheless , the resulting potential does not present any nonrelativistic limit .",
    "oddly enough , @xmath49 only for the positive - ground - state solution in the strong - coupling regime of the theory .",

    "for @xmath55 , the coupling between the upper and the lower components of the dirac spinor can be formally eliminated when eq .",
