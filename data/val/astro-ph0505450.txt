    "black hole - neutron star ( hereafter bhns ) binary systems are , together with other compact binaries , among the most promising sources of gravitational waves for detection by ground - based interferometers such as ligo @xcite , geo600 @xcite , tama300 @xcite , and virgo @xcite , or for the planned space - based mission lisa @xcite . since theoretical predictions for the waveforms from such compact binaries are needed both for the identification and interpretation of any astrophysical signals , significant effort has gone into the theoretical modeling of these binaries and their inspiral ( see @xcite for recent reviews )",
    ".    the orbital separation of a bhns binary decreases as energy and angular momentum are dissipated by the emission of gravitational radiation , which also has the effect of circularizing the orbit , until the system eventually coalesces .",
    "this coalescence can take two qualitatively different forms .",
    "if the neutron star reaches the innermost stable circular orbit ( hereafter isco ) while still stable against tidal disruption , it will likely plunge and fall into the black hole promptly .",
    "alternately , if the neutron star is tidally disrupted outside the isco , the final fate may be a black hole surrounded by a disk .",
    "this model is a candidate central engine for short - period gamma - ray bursts , since the high efficiency of accretion onto a black hole can help to explain the huge luminosities seen in these sources @xcite .",
    "additionally , we may obtain information about the equation of state ( hereafter eos ) of matter at nuclear densities through the detection of a gravitational wave signal , because the characteristic frequency at the tidal disruption separation is in the most sensitive range of the ground - based detectors @xcite .",
    "the difference in the final fate is determined primarily by the mass ratio of the black hole to the neutron star .",
    "when the black hole mass @xmath1 is much larger than the neutron star mass @xmath2 , the tidal force from the black hole is not so large compared with the neutron star self - gravity to disrupt the neutron star , even at the isco .",
    "indeed , the isco occurs at a radius proportional to the black hole mass , whereas the roche limit separation , which would mark the beginning of mass transfer , scales like @xmath3 in the limit of an extremely large mass ratio @xcite .",
    "thus , the larger the black hole mass , the further outward the isco lies relative to the roche limit separation . on the other hand",
    ", a stellar mass black hole will have a tidal field sufficiently large with respect to the neutron star self - gravity to deform and disrupt the companion outside the isco .",
    "the critical value of the mass ratio falls in the range @xmath4 for reasonable neutron star models @xcite , but varies depending on assumptions about the neutron star eos ( see @xcite for a thorough discussion ) .",
    "until now , much effort has been devoted to the computation of the bhns binary systems .",
    "most dynamical simulations so far have been carried out in a newtonian framework @xcite , but see @xcite for approximate relativistic treatments .",
    "quasiequilibrium models of bhns binaries have been constructed adopting various different approximations .",
    "several authors ( including @xcite ) have modeled bhns binaries as newtonian ellipsoids around point masses , generalizing the classic roche model for incompressible stars @xcite .",
    "these ellipsoidal calculations have also been generalized to include relativistic effects @xcite .",
    "recently , these models have been generalized to include higher order deformations than ellipsoid by expanding the background black hole metric to higher order than quadrupole @xcite .",
    "equilibrium models of newtonian bhns binaries also have been constructed by solving the exact fluid equations numerically and again treating the black hole as a point - mass @xcite . with the possible exception of @xcite , baumgarte _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( hereafter bss ) so far provide the only self - consistent relativistic treatment of bhns binaries in quasiequilibrium .    in bss ,",
    "bhns binaries are constructed by solving the constraint equations of general relativity , decomposed in the conformal thin - sandwich formalism , together with the euler equation for the neutron star matter , which takes an algebraic form if the system can be taken to be stationary in a corotating frame .",
    "the equations are solved in the background of a schwarzschild black hole , which accounts for the neutron star s companion .    in this paper",
    "we generalize the findings of bss in two ways .",
    "as discussed above we allow of irrotational instead of corotational fluid flow , which is more realistic astrophysically @xcite .",
    "to do so we adopt the formalism for constructing irrotational stars as developed in @xcite .",
    "we also generalize the results of bss by expressing the black hole background in a different coordinate system . in bss , this background was expressed in kerr - schild coordinates , which we compare here with a black hole background expressed in isotropic coordinates .",
    "since the two coordinate system represent different slicings of the schwarzschild space - time , the resulting initial data are physically distinct solutions of the constraint equations .",
    "finally , in this paper we adopt a numerical code that is based on the spectral method numerical libraries known as lorene @xcite ( as opposed to the finite difference implementation of bss ) .",
    "we maintain several of the other assumptions made by bss , including extreme mass ratio @xmath5 and polytropic equations of state , and plan to relax these in the future .",
    "the spectral techniques used here have previously been employed to compute quasiequilibrium sequences of binary neutron stars @xcite .",
    "there are several advantages in using spectral methods .",
    "one is that it is easy to treat spherical coordinates , which are suitable for solving figures like stars , and to fit the coordinates to trace the stellar surface .",
    "this fitting technique plays an important role in solving irrotational configurations .",
    "another advantage is that it is possible to achieve more rapid convergence compared to finite difference methods , until configurations reach a separation very close to tidal break - up and the appearance of discontinuities in physical quantities ( for more details on the spectral methods techniques we use , we refer the readers to @xcite . ) in our code , the set of equations we solve for the gravitational field is essentially equivalent to that of bss , while the hydrostatic equations are the same as those found in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly summarize the formulation and explain the solution procedure .",
    "the tests of the numerical code are shown in section iii , and the results are presented in section iv . in section",
    "v we discuss the effects of the choice of the black hole background metric , and we summarize in section vi .    throughout the present paper , we adopt geometrical units , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes the gravitational constant and @xmath8 the speed of light , respectively .",
    "latin and greek indices denote purely spatial and space - time components , respectively .",
    "in this section we briefly discuss the basic equations , as well as their numerical implementation . for a more detailed discussion ,",
    "we refer the reader to section iii of bss for the gravitational fields ( but point out some minor differences below ) and to section ii of @xcite for the hydrostatics . for corotating sequences using the kerr - schild metric",
    ", our notation will appear to be slightly different than that found in bss , but the two sets of equations are completely equivalent , merely expressed in a different set of variables .",
    "the line element in 3 + 1 form is written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the lapse function , @xmath11 the shift vector , @xmath12 the spatial metric , and @xmath13 the space - time metric .",
    "the einstein equations then split into two constraint equations  the hamiltonian and the momentum constraint  and two evolution equations ",
    "one for the spatial metric @xmath12 and one for the extrinsic curvature @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the covariant derivative associated with @xmath12 . using the conformal decomposition @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the conformal factor and @xmath18 the background metric",

    "@xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are , respectively , the covariant derivative , covariant laplace operator , ricci tensor , and scalar curvature with respect to @xmath18 .",
    "we have also decomposed the extrinsic curvature into its trace and traceless parts , @xmath27 in the derivation of ( [ eq : lognp ] ) we have assumed @xmath28 , which results in @xmath29 for the quantity @xmath30 finally , we assume that @xmath31 for quasiequilibrium configuration , so that ( [ eq : ext_curv ] ) yields @xmath32 inserting this relation into the momentum constraint yields @xmath33 the matter quantities on the right - hand side of equations ( [ eq : lognp ] ) , ( [ eq : logn ] ) and ( [ eq : shift ] ) are projections of the stress - energy tensor @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the fluid 4-velocity , @xmath36 the baryon rest - mass density , @xmath37 the internal energy density , and @xmath38 the pressure . we then define @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the future - directed unit normal vector .",
    "we account for the neutron star s black hole companion by choosing a background solution that represents a schwarzschild metric . in bss",
    "the schwarzschild solution was expressed in kerr - schild coordinates . in this paper",
    "we analyze the effect of this choice by comparing with the schwarzschild background expressed in isotropic coordinates .",
    "since the two coordinate system represent two distinct slicings of the schwarzschild metric , we solve the constraint equations on different spatial slices , and therefore have no reason to expect that the resulting solutions to the constraint equations are physically identical .    .lapse",

    "there , we compare our data for a neutron star mass @xmath53 and mass ratio @xmath54 in the kerr - schild and isotropic backgrounds .",
    "since the sequences in @xcite were computed using newtonian gravity while we use full general relativity , we can compare only an invariant quantity , e.g. , the orbital angular velocity .",
    "in order to convert their newtonian results to values comparable to our relativistic ones , we scale our results by the radius of a relativistic spherical neutron star with mass @xmath53 , @xmath55 .",
    "our results are shown at the closest separation we calculate , which is several percent further away in distance from the real tidal disruption point , because the spectral method is unable to treat cusp - like figures . thus we find our calculated values are about 15 % smaller than those found in @xcite , but given that our configurations have separations several percent away from the real tidal disruption point , we can say that the agreement with the angular velocities in table [ table : comp_ue99 ] is reasonable .           in the limit of an extreme mass ratio ( @xmath56 ) , the neutron star orbits on a circular , test - particle geodesic .",

    "it is clear that the neutron star in our results still fits well within its roche lobe , but if we decrease the separation only a few percent further , we expect a rapid deformation on the inner edge as a cusp forms at the mass - shedding limit .    for the kerr - schild background",

    "one of the most significant differences between the kerr - schild coordinate system and the isotropic one is the existence / absence of the black hole shift vector . in isotropic coordinates the background shift is zero , while for a kerr - schild background the main contribution to the total shift arises from the schwarzschild background .",

    "we have computed quasiequilibrium sequences of bhns binary systems in general relativity . under the assumption of an extreme mass ratio , @xmath5 , we have treated the contribution of the black hole gravitational field as a fixed background , adopting the schwarzschild metric in both kerr - schild and isotropic coordinates .",

    "we expect that spectral methods allow us to construct each individual model with greater accuracy than the finite difference methods used by bss .",
    "however , the assumption of smoothness inherent in spectral methods prevents us from constructing models very close to the onset of tidal disruption .",
    "this leads to errors in parameters describing the onset of tidal disruption that are greater than those obtained with finite differencing . while we maintain here some of the assumptions from bss , including extreme mass ratios and polytropic equations of state , and plan to relax these in the near future .    in agreement with earlier studies",
    "( e.g.  @xcite ) , we find that the effect of rotation on the onset of tidal disruption is fairly small and in the order of a few percent .",
    "this does not rule out , however , that rotation has a larger effect on the dynamics of the tidal disruption itself ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the rotational state of the neutron star may well affect the size ( or existence ) of an accretion disk that may form as the neutron star is disrupted .",
    "such an accretion disk is at the core of bhns models as central engines of short - period gamma ray bursts ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we also find that the choice of background does have some effect on coordinate - independent quantities describing the resulting binary configurations .",
    "this indicates that the choice of background may affect the degree to which the solutions approximate quasiequilibrium , as well as the amount of spurious gravitational radiation inherent in the solutions",
