    "positive charge ( hole ) transfer in dna is extensively investigated since its experimental discovery @xcite .",
    "this process can be responsible for the oxidative dna damage @xcite and is possibly important for dna repairing @xcite .",
    "also an ability of dna to promote long distant charge transfer can be used in molecular electronics applications @xcite .",
    "these studies raise the question , whether dna is a molecular conductor . in molecular conductors ( e. g. carbon nanotubes ) charge",
    "is usually delocalized within several sites ( monomers ) .",
    "such system possesses a high conductivity similarly to metals .",
    "the alternative behavior takes place when the charge is typically localized within the single site and it hops to adjacent sites due to rare environment fluctuations .",
    "based on the results of direct measurements of charge transfer in dna @xcite we argue in this paper that dna is not a molecular conductor .",
    "dna contains two different sorts of base pairs @xmath8 and @xmath9 forming quasi - random sequences .",
    "the lowest ionization potential is attributed to a @xmath9 pair ( essentially g - base @xcite ) .",
    "since the electron transfer integral @xmath0 between adjacent bases does not exceed @xmath8 - @xmath9 ionization potential difference @xmath10ev , the quantum state of charge in a static environment will be localized near some @xmath6 base and its localization length is comparable to the interbase distance @xcite .",
    "interaction with environment breaks down this localization , inducing charge hopping between quantum states localized at adjacent @xmath6 sites .",
    "this happens because of rare environment fluctuations supporting delocalization of charge between neighboring @xmath6 bases .",
    "indeed , according to experimental studies @xcite and theoretical models @xcite the sequence dependent charge transfer in dna can be represented as the series of charge hops between adjacent @xmath6 bases serving as centers of localized states .",
    "an addition of @xmath8 pair between @xmath9 base pairs dramatically reduces the charge hopping rate @xcite and therefore the optimum base sequence for the efficient charge transfer consists of identical base pairs .",
    "we are going to study a charge ( hole ) quantum states in sequences of identical @xmath9 pairs of various lengths , as most promising candidates for efficient charge transfer .",
    "the thermal energy at room temperature @xmath11ev is very small compared to at least one of the characteristic energies of the system including the reorganization energy @xmath1 and the electron transfer integral @xmath0 .",
    "the reorganization energy is caused by the electrostatic interaction of the hole with the environment and its minimum estimate is @xmath12ev @xcite .",
    "the electron transfer integral @xmath0 is associated with the pi - stacking interaction of heterocyclic groups in dna bases .",
    "it is defined as the gain in the hole energy due to its sharing between two adjacent dna bases having equal energies with respect to the energy of the hole localized within a single @xmath6 base @xcite .",
    "the minimum estimate for the electron transfer integral between adjacent @xmath6 bases is around @xmath13ev @xcite .",
    "thus the thermal energy is , indeed , small compared to other characteristic energies and we can use the ground state of the hole coupled to environment as the representative state .",
    "one should notice that the ground state can be used as a representative state , but it strongly differs from transition states responsible for the charge transfer . since the hole transitions are quite rare the `` typical '' charge state can be described ignoring them .",
    "the spatial size of the hole ground state is determined by the competition of the delocalization of charge due to the pi - stacking interaction of heterocyclic groups belonging to adjacent bases and the localization caused by the environment polarization around the charge .",
    "the charge delocalization energy is characterized by the effective electron transfer integral @xmath0 and the localization energy is given by the environment reorganization energy @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "delocalization of charge over @xmath14 base pairs leads to the gain in the kinetics energy @xmath15 , similarly to the classical problem of particle in the box .",
    "the reorganization energy scales with the size of charge wavefunction as @xmath16 ( see e. g. @xcite ) . this dependence can be understood as following .",
    "the local environment polarization induced by the hole is proportional to the charge density @xmath17 , where @xmath18 stands for the local charge density .",
    "consequently the interaction in each site having charge @xmath19 with the environment polarization is proportional to their product @xmath20 and the sum of all these @xmath14 interactions over all @xmath14 sites results in the dependence @xmath21 .",
    "this dependence takes place only in a one - dimensional system .",
    "since at large @xmath14 the reorganization energy @xmath22 dominates over the kinetic energy @xmath23 , the ground states is always localized and the localization radius can be estimated using the number of sites @xmath14 minimizing the total energy @xmath24 the minimum takes place at @xmath25 which is the number of dna bases occupied by the hole in its ground state . at zero temperature",
    "the hole is localized , while at finite temperature it can hop between different states because of its interaction with the fluctuating environment . in the translationally invariant system ( @xmath2 or @xmath26 )",
    "the potential barrier separating two configurations can be estimated as the energy price for the environment fluctuation increasing the size of the wavefunction by one more site compared to its optimum state @xmath27 , which can be expressed as @xmath28 eq . ( [ eq : toten ] ) .",
    "such fluctuation creates the transition state and after the relaxation of environment the hole can arrive at the new equilibrium centered at different @xmath6 base . if @xmath5 then this activation energy is given by approximately a quarter of the reorganization energy @xmath29 . then we expect the hole mobility to obey the arrhenius law as in insulators . in the opposite limit",
    "we obtain a very small value @xmath30 , which becomes negligible at moderately large @xmath31 .",
    "for instance if @xmath32ev the potential barrier for the hole transition becomes smaller than the thermal energy @xmath33ev already at @xmath34 . in this regime charge transport is weakly sensitive to the temperature as in metals .",
    "therefore it is very important to determine the true relationship of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in dna .",
    "this relationship characterizes its conducting behavior .",
    "indeed , in the regime @xmath35 a dna molecule made of identical base pairs would behave as a one - dimensional conductor , while in the opposite limit dna can not be treated as a molecular wire .",
    "existing estimates in literature @xcite do not help much in determining the relationship of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , because there is a large controversy between different studies .",
    "in particular , various estimates for the electron transfer integral @xmath0 range from @xmath36ev @xcite to @xmath37ev @xcite . also",
    "all calculations of @xmath0 ignore vibrational rearrangements .",
    "polar vibrational modes associated with the covalent bonds possess a high vibrational quantum energy @xmath38ev @xmath39 . at room temperature these modes",
    "must remain in the ground state during charge tunneling .",
    "however since the tunneling of hole changes the equilibrium coordinates of polar vibrations they must tunnel together with the hole .",
    "this leads to the redefinition of the effective tunneling amplitude @xmath0 ( if it is smaller then the reorganization energy @xmath40 ) associated with the given vibrational mode @xcite as @xmath41 to our knowledge this effect is ignored in all existing theoretical estimates of the electron transfer integral .",
    "the calculations for the reorganization energy @xmath1 associated with the classical interaction with solvent were made using the continuous medium approach .",
    "the estimates of @xmath1 range from @xmath42ev @xcite to more than @xmath43ev @xcite due to uncertainty in the water dielectric constant value near the dna molecule .",
    "it is hard therefore to select the right parameters based on existing theoretical results .",
    "we suggest an alternative method to study the hole quantum state within the dna molecule , using experimental data sensitive to the relationship of two key parameters of the theory @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "namely , we exploit the rate constants for the balance of charge transfer reactions between different @xmath2 complexes , measured by lewis and coworkers @xcite @xmath44 in the thermal equilibrium these ratios are determined by base pair partition functions @xmath45 where @xmath46 stands for the partition function of @xmath47 sequence containing the single hole in it , while @xmath48 is the partition function of the same base sequence , but without the hole .",
    "since @xmath6 and @xmath47 complexes are separated by some @xmath8 bridge we can ignore their interactions .",
    "we assumed that the charge transfer between @xmath6 and @xmath47 complexes is very slow compared to the charge transfer rate inside the complex .",
    "this agrees with experiments showing the strong reduction of the charge transfer rate with the length of @xmath8 separating @xmath9 pairs @xcite .",
    "consequently the contribution of highly excited states like the transition states for the charge transfer between complexes to the partition functions can be neglected so we can assume that the local equilibrium of charge within @xmath47 sequence is established . accordingly one can use eq .",
    "( [ eq : rat1 ] ) for the ratio of charge transfer rates .    both ratios in eq .",
    "( [ grindeq__5 _ ] ) are determined by parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 and the thermal energy at room temperature @xmath49 .",
    "below we calculate both ratios using tight binding model for @xmath47 complexes and standard linear response theory for charge interaction with the environment @xcite .",

    "we assume the electron transfer integral @xmath0 to be independent of the environment fluctuations .",
