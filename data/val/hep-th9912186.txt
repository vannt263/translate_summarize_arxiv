    "the work of arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali ( add ) @xcite and of randall and sundrum ( rs ) @xcite has stimulated interest in explaining the observed weakness of gravity ( the `` hierarchy problem '' ) using extra dimensions .",
    "the add solution requires the new dimensions to have finite but large volume , which introduces a new hierarchy between the volume of the compact dimension and the fundamental scale of the theory .",
    "rs proposed instead five dimensional spacetime with curvature comparable to the fundamental scale , and showed that a massless graviton can be localized to a 3 + 1 dimensional hypersurface known as the `` planck brane '' . in their setup the extra dimension may be taken infinitely large , and four dimensional general relativity still agrees to high precision with long distance experimental measurement .",
    "the weakness of observed gravity is explained provided the standard model fields are localized to a 3 + 1 dimensional `` tev brane '' , where the graviton wave function is small . due to the exponential fall - off of the graviton wave function away from the planck brane , the distance between the tev brane and the planck brane does not need to be large in units of the fundamental scale .",
    "randall and lykken ( rl ) @xcite have shown that an infinite fifth dimension is experimentally quite consistent with such a resolution of the hierarchy problem .",
    "in such a picture , it is necessary to introduce dynamics which determines the location of the tev brane relative to the planck brane .",
    "if this interbrane distance is not fixed , it becomes a massless modulus which leads to unnacceptable cosmology @xcite and experimental consequences .",
    "goldberger and wise showed that adding a scalar field which propagates in the bulk and has a source on the branes is sufficient to fix this distance @xcite .",
    "several other suggestions have been made for bulk dynamics to fix the extra dimensional configuration @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we first construct a class of solutions to the einstein s equations for dimensions greater than or equal to six .",
    "these solutions are characterized by a non - trivial warp factor and possess a non - compact extra dimension .",
    "we then study in detail a simple model in six dimensions containing two four branes that employs a metric of this form to address the hierarchy problem .",
    "one of each brane s four spatial directions is compactified on a circle of small radius .",
    "the hierarchy problem is resolved as in the rs and rl models by the enormous difference in the warp factors at the positions of the two branes , with the standard model fields living on the brane with small warp factor .    in this model",
    "the positions of the branes , and hence the magnitude of the hierarchy , are determined by the combination of two independent effects .",
    "the first is an anisotropic contribution to the stress tensor of each brane arising from the quantum effects of fields localised to it .",
    "the second is a contribution to the stress tensor from a scalar bulk field as in the model of goldberger and wise .",
    "these effects are naturally comparable in size and together can yield a sufficiently large value of the brane spacing to solve the hierarchy problem without fine tuning of parameters .",
    "the reason for the first effect is that the theory contains a compact dimension , in addition to the noncompact dimension @xmath0 .",
    "the size of the compact dimension is in general an @xmath0 dependent function , which is determined from the einstein s equations .",
    "we argue that in general the component of the brane tension in the compact dimension will depend on its size , due to the quantum effects of fields localized to the brane .",
    "then a consistent solution to einstein s equations will fix each brane location at a particular value of @xmath0 .",
    "however in this model this effect by itself does not give rise to a large hierarchy without fine tuning .",
    "nevertheless when combined with the effect of a bulk scalar field on the geometry it is possible to realise a large hierarchy without fine tuning of parameters .    both branes in the theory can have positive tensions and the solution is free of singularities where general relativity might break down .",
    "one overall fine tuning of the parameters in the theory is required to adjust the four dimensional cosmological constant to zero .",
    "we begin by looking for solutions to the einstein equations in d dimensions , where d is greater than or equal to six , in the presence of a constant background bulk cosmological constant .",
    "we assume all sources other than the bulk cosmological constant are restricted to subspaces of lower dimension .",
    "hence our approach will be to first solve the equations of motion in the bulk to obtain solutions with a number of constants of integration that can then be adjusted to find solutions for various boundary conditions .",
    "the action in the bulk is    @xmath1    we label a general coordinate by @xmath2 where @xmath3 runs from 0 to ( d-1 ) .",
    "we restrict our search to metrics of the simple form    @xmath4    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 run from 0 to d-3 .",
    "the remaining two coordinates are labelled by @xmath7 and @xmath8 . here",
    "the warp factors @xmath9 and @xmath10 are assumed to be functions only of @xmath8 .",
    "the einstein s equations in the bulk take the form    @xmath11    the nontrivial components of this equation are    @xmath12    @xmath13 = \\alpha^2 \\frac{(d-2)^2+(d-2)}{8}\\ ] ]    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is defined by    @xmath16    to solve these equations note that we can rewrite eqn .",
    "( [ eq : feqn ] ) in the form    @xmath17    = \\alpha^2 \\frac{(d-2)^2+(d-2)}{8}\\ .\\ ] ]    this has the form of a first order differential equation for @xmath18 .",
    "this differential equation is straightforward to solve , and we can then obtain @xmath9 itself by performing a simple integration .",
    "we then use the result obtained for @xmath9 in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : seqn ] ) and the problem of determining @xmath10 also then reduces to performing a simple integral",
    ". the results are    @xmath19^{\\frac{4}{d-1}}\\ ] ]    @xmath20^{-2\\frac{(d-3)}{d-1 } } \\left[1+ce^{-\\frac{d-1}{2}{\\alpha}z}\\right]^2\\ .\\ ] ]    here @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are constants to be determined by boundary conditions . in the limits of vanishing @xmath23 and infinite @xmath23",
    "we recover the usual anti desitter ( ads ) metric .",
    "it is easy to see that in fact for any values of these constants the warp factors @xmath9 and @xmath10 change very rapidly as function of @xmath8 .",
    "in particular there are always values of @xmath8 where they are changing exponentially quickly .",
    "this suggests that these metrics are good candidates for a solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "it is possible to use the class of metrics above to find solutions to the einstein equations for various source configurations and geometries . in the next section we exhibit a potential solution to the hierarchy problem based on these metrics .",
    "in this section we limit our interest to a solution where the fifth dimension @xmath7 is compact and corresponds to an angle in the higher dimensional space .",
    "we relabel @xmath7 by @xmath24 in this section and hereafter to emphasize its angular character .",
    "the angle @xmath24 runs from zero to @xmath25 .",
    "we allow the coordinate @xmath8 to be non - compact and run from zero to infinity .",
    "it corresponds to a ` radius ' in the higher dimensional space .",
    "we relabel it by @xmath0 to emphasize its radial character .",
    "the geometry of our model consists of two four branes localized in the higher dimensional space at different values of @xmath0 .",
    "their positions are specified by the equations @xmath26 and @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "they can therefore be thought of as being similar to the surfaces of two infinitely long ` concentric cylinders ' in the higher dimensional space , with the regular four dimensions parallel to the common axis of the cylinders , the fifth dimension going around the surface but perpendicular to the axis , and the sixth dimension being the radius .",
    "( this intuitive picture does not account for the fact that the space is curved . )",
    "the standard model fields are localized to the brane at @xmath26 .",
    "the hierarchy problem will be resolved by the enormous difference between the values of the warp factor at @xmath26 and @xmath27 .    because the coordinate @xmath24 is compact the four brane appears as a three brane at sufficiently long length scales .    the branes divide the space into three distinct sections ; @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 . in general",
    "there is no reason for the bulk cosmological constants in these three sections to be the same since the branes may be separating different phases of the theory .",
    "in what follows we will assume that they are different and will associate the three regions with three different values of @xmath15 ; @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively",
    ".    the solutions of the einstein equations in the three regions will be of the form of equations ( [ eq : f ] ) and ( [ eq : s ] ) but with different values of the constants @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we will give these constants an additional subscript @xmath35 , where @xmath35 runs from 1 to 3 , in order to differentiate them in the three different regions .",
    "now the constant @xmath36 is fixed to be -1 by the requirement that the solution be non - singular at the origin .",
    "this requirement also fixes the value of @xmath37 to be @xmath38 . to see that this choice does indeed smooth out the singularity at the origin we first examine the behavior of the the functions @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    "as @xmath0 tends to 0 ,    @xmath41    we then go to the ` cartesian ' coordinate system which is smooth at the origin .",
    "@xmath42    it is straightforward to verify that in this coordinate system the components of the metric and their first and second derivatives ( which go into the ricci tensor ) are smooth at the origin , showing that there is no singularity there .    the requirement that the metric be bounded at infinity determines that the space outside @xmath27 be ads .",
    "this corresponds to setting @xmath43 to infinity while keeping the products @xmath44 and @xmath45 finite .",
    "we relabel these products by @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively .",
    "we are now in a position to write down the forms of the solutions in the three regions . for @xmath48 ,    @xmath49^{\\frac{4}{5}}\\ ] ]    @xmath50^{\\frac{-6}{5 } } [ 1 - e^{-\\frac{5}{2}{\\alpha_1}r}]^2\\ .\\ ] ]    for @xmath51 ,    @xmath52^{\\frac{4}{5}}\\ ] ]    @xmath53^{\\frac{-6}{5 } } [ 1 + c_2 e^{-\\frac{5}{2}{\\alpha_2}r}]^2\\ ] ]    for @xmath31 ,    @xmath54    @xmath55    the constant @xmath56 is determined by normalizing the warp factor @xmath9 to 1 at the position of the visible brane .",
    "the constant @xmath37 was determined earlier .",
    "all the other constants above as well as the positions of the branes @xmath57 and @xmath58 must be determined by matching across the branes .",
    "we now write down the action for the branes .",
    "@xmath59 + \\delta(r - b))[l_{m2 } - \\bar{\\lambda}_2])\\ .\\ ] ]    here @xmath60 is the determinant of the metric tensor in the five dimensional subspace , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the cosmological constants on the two branes , and @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the lagrangians of matter fields localized to the branes .    the stress tensor for each brane has the form    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the contribution from the cosmological constant and @xmath67 the expectation value of the stress tensor of the matter fields living on the brane .",
    "we will be working in the semi - classical limit , treating gravity completely classically but accounting for the quantum effects of matter localized to the branes .    assuming the matter on the brane is in its ground state , @xmath68 is constrained by four dimensional lorentz invariance to be of the form    @xmath69    where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are constants associated with each brane that we require to be positive .",
    "the form of @xmath66 is more constrained since it is proportional to @xmath72 , which would imply that @xmath73 if the only contribution to @xmath74 came from the cosmological constant on the brane .",
    "thus the deviation of @xmath74 from the @xmath72 form is due entirely to the contribution from the matter lagrangian . in a subsequent section",
    "we will show that the contribution to the stress tensor from the zero point energies of fields living on the brane lead to @xmath75 . in general @xmath76 and @xmath77 will depend on the geometrical factors @xmath78 and @xmath79 due to the quantum contribution to the stress tensor from matter localized on the brane .",
    "now the einstein equations for the upper 5 by 5 block of the ricci tensor get modified in the presence of the branes to    @xmath80    since we already have the solution in the bulk we can get the complete solution by matching across the branes .",
    "the metric tensor is continuous across the branes but its derivatives are not .",
    "the above equation fixes the jump discontinuity in the derivatives across the boundary .    in terms of components",
    "the conditions on the derivatives are    @xmath81    we wish to apply these conditions to our solution . to simplify matters we first define    @xmath82    the conditions on the derivatives at the first boundary are @xmath83 + \\frac{5}{2 } \\left [ f(-c_2,a,\\alpha_2 ) - f(1,a,\\alpha_1)\\right ] & = & -\\frac{1}{2}\\bar{\\gamma}_1 ^ 2 \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the conditions at the second boundary are @xmath84    looking at the above equations we have three parameters @xmath79 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 which have to satisfy four independent equations .",
    "hence a fine tuning is necessary .",
    "this is the fine tuning necessary to set the effective four dimensional cosmological constant to zero .",
    "once this fine tuning has been made it is straightforward to find solutions to the above equations without singularities where all parameters are of order one in terms of the fundamental scale @xmath85 .",
    "however since we want to generate a hierarchy we want @xmath86 . from now on we will assume that @xmath58 is the only large parameter in the problem and that it is therefore responsible for generating the hierarchy .",
    "subtracting eqn .",
    "( [ eq : gam ] ) from eqn .",
    "( [ eq : gamb ] ) we see that    @xmath87    note that from the definition of @xmath88 it is clear that if @xmath89 , then @xmath90 .",
    "but the difference between @xmath76 and @xmath77 arises from the vacuum energy of quantum fields localized to the brane ( the casimir effect ) , which vanishes in the limit of large proper radius for the compact dimension .",
    "as will be discussed in a subsequent section the casimir effect is finite and regulator independent in the limit that the cutoff is taken to infinity .",
    "then by dimensional considerations if the fields on the brane are massless the right hand side must be of order @xmath91^{-\\frac{5}{2}}$ ] since the proper size of the compact dimension is the only scale in the problem .",
    "then the equation above becomes    @xmath92\\ , \\ ] ]    where the constant above is of order one in units of the fundamental scale .",
    "while we see that both sides of this equation are the same order of magnitude even for large @xmath58 we also see that @xmath58 only appears in the combination @xmath93 .",
    "it is this combination which is determined in terms of the various tensions .",
    "hence although the brane spacing is fixed , a large value for @xmath94 is only possible through a fine tuning of parameters which is over and above the fine tuning necessary to set the four dimensional cosmological constant to zero . in the next section",
    "we shall show that by adding a scalar field in the bulk  la goldberger and wise @xcite the matching conditions at the branes can be made more sensitive to @xmath58 and the hierarchy can be made natural .",
    "equating the various components of the metric across the boundary fixes the values of the coefficients @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "once again there are four equations but there are now four unknowns so there is no further fine tuning required .",

    "this completes the determination of the metric in the absence of any bulk matter . the warp factor for the fifth dimension",
    "is plotted in figure  1 for a choice of parameters for which there is a large hierarchy .",
    "the warp factor for the usual 3 + 1 dimensions is qualitatively similar , except near @xmath98 where it goes to a constant .",
    "we call this the `` space needle metric '' for reasons which are obvious from the picture .      in this section",
    "we show that when the model of the previous section is modified by the inclusion of bulk scalar fields , the hierarchy can be made natural .",
    "the action for the scalar field @xmath99    here @xmath100 is the mass of the scalar field in the bulk",
    ". we will be interested in the limit @xmath101 , since this is where we naturally obtain a large hierarchy .",
    "the scalar field sources @xmath102 and @xmath103 are in general arbitrary functions . for simplicity we will take    @xmath104    the coupled equations for the gravity - matter system are difficult to solve . we shall address the problem by a successive approximation method .",
    "we will first solve for the gravitational field in the absence of the scalar field , assuming that the contribution to the stress tensor of this field is small .",
    "we will then solve for the scalar field in this geometry , and compute the stress tensor @xmath105 of the scalar field .",
    "we then can substitute this solution back into the einstein equations to determine the correction to the geometry induced by the stress tensor of the scalar field .",
    "if we wish , this procedure , which is essentially an expansion in @xmath106 , can be carried out to higher orders but the lowest order will be sufficient to to fix the brane spacing , which we expect will receive only small corrections at higher orders .    for simplicity we will take as a starting metric    @xmath107    @xmath108    this corresponds to a solution for the special case with no bulk cosmological constant for @xmath109 but the same cosmological constant everywhere outside , and @xmath110",
    ". this metric is flat in the neighborhood of the origin and pure ads outside @xmath57 .",
    "this is a special case , with @xmath32 and @xmath79 set to zero , of the more general class of metrics we have considered in section iiia .",
    "non - zero @xmath79 will be treated perturbatively in what follows and we will also indicate how to include @xmath32 perturbatively . hence the only loss of generality arising from this starting",
    "metric is that we can only extend our conclusions to the more general class of metrics of the previous section when @xmath79 and @xmath32 are sufficiently small that a perturbative approach is valid .",
    "we first solve for the scalar field in this background metric .",
    "the equation of motion is    @xmath111    the solutions in the three regions consistent with smoothness of @xmath112 at the origin and vanishing of @xmath112 at infinity are    @xmath113    where we have neglected higher order terms in @xmath114 in equation ( 45 ) , and @xmath115    for positive @xmath116 @xmath117 is positive and @xmath118 negative . then @xmath119 the coefficients @xmath120 and @xmath121 are to be determined by matching the solutions for @xmath112 across the boundaries .",
    "we require continuity of @xmath112 across the boundaries and the following jump conditions    @xmath122    at the first boundary and @xmath123 at the second boundary .",
    "since the expressions for the @xmath120 s and @xmath121 s are complicated we will neglect effects of order @xmath124 which are very small and further assume @xmath125 so that such effects can also be neglected .",
    "these approximations will not affect our conclusions .",
    "then in this limit the expressions for the @xmath120 s and @xmath121 s are    @xmath126    we now find the contribution to the stress tensor from the field @xmath112 , @xmath105 .",
    "@xmath127    next , we substitute the stress tensor back into the einstein equations to determine the corrections to the geometry . for convenience",
    "we define @xmath128 , @xmath129 .",
    "the einstein equations in the region @xmath130 take the form    @xmath131    the equations inside @xmath109 can be obtained by setting @xmath132 in the equations above .",
    "the equations for @xmath133 are identical to those above .",
    "we are interested in the correction to the geometry to linear order in @xmath134 . to obtain this",
    "we expand    @xmath135    and linearize in @xmath136 and @xmath137 . then for @xmath109 the equations ( 58 ) and ( 60 ) above become    @xmath138    these equations yield    @xmath139    which can be integrated to get @xmath136 and @xmath137 . here",
    "we have used the constraints of smoothness at the origin and the linearized form of the bianchi identity .",
    "the latter is shown below .",
    "@xmath140    for @xmath130",
    "the equations ( 59 ) and ( 60 ) when linearized become    @xmath141    these yield    @xmath142    which can be integrated to yield @xmath136 and @xmath137 . here",
    "@xmath143 is a constant of integration which must be determined from matching and once again the linearized form of the bianchi identity for this region , shown below , has been used .",
    "@xmath144    in identical fashion we can get for the region @xmath133    @xmath145    here the requirement that the metric die away at infinity has been imposed .",
    "this completes the determination of bulk corrections to the metric .",
    "the final step is to match across the branes thereby determining the brane positions and the undetermined constant @xmath143 .",
    "the conditions on the continuity of the metric across the brane are straightforward to satisfy because of the additional constants of integration that will be obtained on integrating the expressions for @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "once @xmath9 has been normalized to one on the visible brane and the requirement of smoothness has been met at @xmath98 all these additional constants will have been fixed .    we now focus our attention on the jump conditions on the derivatives . at the inner brane we have    @xmath148    at the outer brane    @xmath149    these are four independent equations for the three unknowns @xmath78 and @xmath143 . just as in the previous section , the metric and brane locations are completely determined with one overall fine tuning needed to find a poincar invariant solution .",
    "first consider the situation without the scalar field , _ i.e. _ @xmath150 .",
    "this is the same case which was considered in the previous section . in general , as we found , the metric beween the branes need not be pure ads even without a scalar field .",
    "the tensions of the branes must be finetuned to set @xmath143 to zero .",
    "we are allowing these brane tensions ( which are related to @xmath70 and @xmath71 in the above equations ) to deviate from those fine tuned values by small amounts . here",
    "small merely means that perturbation theory is valid .",
    "then it is straightforward to verify that the equations ( 74 ) to ( 77 ) are simply linearized versions of equations ( 29 ) to ( 32 ) with @xmath151 and the parameter @xmath143 is proportional to @xmath79 .",
    "hence even in the absence of the scalar field the metric between the branes is not of the ads form , and our conclusions once the scalar field is introduced will be valid for this more general class of metrics . setting @xmath152 in the above formulas to a constant non zero value for @xmath109",
    "corresponds to allowing non zero @xmath32 .",
    "although it is straightforward to accomodate non zero @xmath32 perturbatively in this framework , for simplicity we shall keep @xmath153 in what follows below , and @xmath152 will be related only to @xmath105 and will not include any piece from a cosmological constant .",
    "we now return to the general case with a scalar field .",
    "we are interested in a solution with all parameters of order one in units of the fundamental scale but we allow @xmath154 to be somewhat less than one in order to obtain a hierarchy .    rather than give the exact solution we will give the more informative order of magnitude results . for dimensional considerations any parameter of order one in units of the fundamental scale will be denoted by the appropriate power of @xmath15 .    the matching conditions at the inner brane , eqs .",
    "( 74 ) and ( 75 ) , determine @xmath57 and @xmath143 as functions of @xmath58 .",
    "provided @xmath155 is less than or of order one , @xmath57 and @xmath143 are of order one in units of the fundamental scale .",
    "the dependence of @xmath143 on @xmath58 is    @xmath156    this result will turn out to be crucial for the solution of the hierarchy problem .    both the equations at the outer brane are sensitive to @xmath58 and @xmath57 only through exponentially small terms .",
    "this is because the value of @xmath112 and its derivatives is exponentially insensitive to @xmath58 and @xmath57 in this region , which manifests itself in the forms of @xmath146 and @xmath147 close to the outer brane .",
    "this is similar to the insensitivity to @xmath58 of equations ( 31 ) and ( 32 ) .",
    "one might therefore worry that just as in the previous case an exponentially precise fine tuning will be necessary to get a hierarchy .",
    "however the finetuning in the previous case was related to the fact that near the planck - brane the metric was very nearly pure ads , which is a homogenous space , and the compact dimension was exponentially large , so that the location of the planck brane had very little effect on the matching conditions at either brane . in the present case with a light bulk",
    "scalar the value of the scalar at the tev brane depends more sensitively on @xmath58 . to determine @xmath58 , add equations ( 76 ) and ( 77 ) to obtain    @xmath157    this is the analogue of equation ( 33 ) in the previous section .",
    "recall that @xmath158 arises from the vacuum energy of quantum fields localised on the brane and is of order @xmath159 .",
    "then this equation , together with equation ( [ eq : d ] ) which relates @xmath143 to @xmath58 , determines @xmath58 as    @xmath160    clearly @xmath100 need not be much smaller than @xmath15 to get a sizable hierarchy .",
    "the difference of equations ( 76 ) and ( 77 ) , which we have not yet used , becomes the condition that the effective four dimensional cosmological constant is zero , which is the usual finetuning .",
    "one limitation of the above approach is that the inner brane necessarily has negative tension along the non compact directions .",
    "this is a consequence of the choice of a starting metric with zero @xmath32 and @xmath79 and the fact that deviations from this metric can only be perturbative .",
    "the nonzero @xmath32 case is not simple but there is a limit in which it is tractable  that in which @xmath161 is perturbatively less than one , even though @xmath32 is not small . in this limit , neglecting higher order terms in @xmath162 we find    @xmath163    we can substitute for this in equation ( 44 ) and find that to the order shown the solution ( 45 ) is unchanged . now",
    "if @xmath164 the inner brane can have positive tension and it is straightforward to verify that all the other conclusions above go through as before .      to determine the effective four dimensional planck scale we concentrate on the higher dimensional einstein action .",
    "when the two extra dimensions are integrated out this will contain the usual four dimensional einstein action .",
    "@xmath165    expanding @xmath166 and integrating out the two extra dimensions we see that    @xmath167    and consequently    @xmath168    rather than do this integral exactly we will be satisfied with an estimate .",
    "the dominant contribution to the integral comes from the region close to the outer brane where the integrand is very large and the forms of @xmath9 and @xmath10 are very nearly simple exponentials . for the purposes of the estimate we set @xmath169 .",
    "@xmath170    this large exponent is responsible for the hierarchy between the planck scale and the weak scale .",

    "a complication that arises for the case of a massless field is that the fourth derivative and higher of @xmath236 and @xmath237 are not well defined at @xmath249 .",
    "we account for this by separating this point from the sum and approximating the rest of the sum by integrals from @xmath250 to infinity and @xmath251 to negative infinity .    to obtain a reasonable estimate",

    "gravity is mostly localized to the outer brane while we assume the standard model lives on the inner brane , explaining the apparent weakness of gravity in our world .",
    "there are no massless moduli associated with either the size of the compact dimension or the brane locations .",
    "this provides an explicit demonstration that the gauge hierarchy problem can be solved in six dimensions , without supersymmetry , and with negligible corrections to gravity at distances longer than an inverse tev .",
    "gravitational effects do become strong at energies of order a tev .",
    "we leave discussion of gravitational collider phenomenology of new noncompact dimensions for future work .",
    "we do not address the important issue of how to obtain chiral fermions on the standard model brane .",
    "ordinary dimensional reduction by compactifying the fifth dimension on a circle always results in a non - chiral theory .",
    "one simple alternate possibility is to have the standard model live on a 3-brane at the center of space .",
    "then it is only necessary to have one 4-brane  the planck brane .",
    "the metric is simply the @xmath253 limit of the space needle metric .",
    "alternatively , it may be possible to generalize our mechanism to additional dimensions with some compactification which does allow a chiral effective theory on the tev brane .",
