    "with the spectroscopic observations of the optical afterglow of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) 970508 by metzger et al .",
    "( 1997 ) came proof that at least one grb is at a cosmological distance .",
    "kulkarni et al .",
    "( 1998b ) later added another cosmological grb , which , based on an association with a high redshift galaxy , had an implied energy release of @xmath2 erg .",
    "however , not all grbs have been shown to be associated with distant host galaxies . only about half of all grbs are followed by long - lived optical afterglow and one in four produce a longer - lived radio afterglow at or above the 100 @xmath3jy level .",
    "in contrast , x - ray afterglow have been seen for almost all bepposax - localized bursts . until recently",
    ", the emerging picture had been that all grbs are located at cosmological distances and these grbs ( hereafter , cosmological grbs or c - grbs ) are associated with star - forming regions and that c - grbs are the death - throes of massive stars .",
    "grb 980425 ( galama et al .  1998 ) initially appeared to be one of the those grbs without a detectable optical ( galama et al .",
    "1998b ; bloom et al .",
    "1998 ) or radio afterglow ( wieringa et al .  1998 ) .",
    "however , a possible candidate x - ray afterglow was identified ( pian et al .",
    "galama et al .",
    "( 1998b ) noted that within the initial localization of the grb ( as opposed to any putative x - ray afterglow position ) there was a bright optical source , later classified as sn 1998bw of type ic .",
    "galama et al .",
    "( 1998 ) argue that the probability of finding a sne within the 8-arcminute error circle of this grb and an inferred explosion date coincident within a few days of the grb is small , @xmath4 .",
    "accordingly , they suggested that grb 980425 is related to the sn .",
    "sn 1998bw showed very strong radio emission with rapid turn on and , in fact , is the brightest radio sn to date ( wieringa et al .",
    "this rarity further diminished the probability of chance coincidence ( sadler et al .",
    "nonetheless , as with all _ a posteriori _ estimates , it is difficult to estimate the real odds of coincidence .    from the radio observations ,",
    "kulkarni et al .  ( 1998c ) concluded that there exists a relativistic shock ( bulk lorentz factor , @xmath5 ) even 4 days after the sn explosion .",
    "this relativistic shock appears to be slowing down as it presumably accrets circumstellar matter .",
    "likewise , the shock would have been even more relativistic earlier in time and thus kulkarni et al",
    ".  argue that the young shock had all the necessary ingredients ( high @xmath6 , sufficient energy ) to generate a burst of @xmath7-rays .",
    "we feel that the physical connection between grb 980425 and sn 1998bw is strong . accepting this connection",
    "then implies that there is at least one grb which is not of distant cosmological origin but is instead related to a sn event in the local universe ( @xmath8 mpc ) .",
    "we refer to this category of grbs as supernova - grbs or s - grbs .",
    "many questions arise : how common are s - grbs ? how can they be distinguished from c - grbs ?",
    "what are their typical energetics ?    attempting to answer such questions , wang &  wheeler ( 1998 ) compiled a list of sne that were both spatially and temporally coincident with peculiar supernovae .",
    "they find a strong correlation of type ic and ib sn with some grbs .",
    "woosley , eastman , & schmidt ( 1998 ) and iwamoto et al .",
    "( 1998 ) interpret grb 980425 as a member of a new class of grbs  the s - grbs . based on their modeling of the light curve and the spectrum of the sn",
    "they conclude that this sn was more energetic than ordinary sne .",
    "the rarity once again makes the proposed association more probable .    in this paper",
    "we accept the hypothesis that grb 980425 is associated with sn 1998bw . accepting the physical model advocated by kulkarni et al .",
    "( 1998c ) we enumerate the defining characteristics of the class of s - grbs .",
    "we then apply these criteria to the proposed s - grbs ( wang & wheeler 1998 , woosley , eastman , & schmidt 1998 ) .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the potential number of s - grbs .",
    "below we enumerate the expected characteristics of s - grbs .",
    "the list is motivated by the radio observations of sn 1998bw and the model developed by kulkarni et al .",
    "( 1998c ) to explain the observations .",
    "briefly , from the radio data , kulkarni et al .",
    "( 1998c ) conclude that the radio emitting region is expanding at least at @xmath9 ( four days after the explosion ) and slowing down to @xmath10 , one month after the burst .",
    "this slow down makes sense since the shock is running into circumstellar matter and this accretion surely should slow the shock . applying the same logic in reverse , it is reasonable to expect the shock to have had a higher @xmath6 when it was younger .",
    "the expectation is that this high-@xmath6 shock is somehow responsible for the observed burst of gamma - rays ( either via synchrotron emission or inverse - compton scattering ) . in this physical model ,",
    "the radio emission and the gamma - ray emission have the same shock origin . of note , whereas in c - grbs , the primary afterglow is optical , in s - grbs the primary afterglow is in the radio band .      an unambiguous indication of a relativistic shock in a sn is when the inferred brightness temperature , @xmath11 exceeds @xmath12 k , the so - called `` inverse compton catastrophe '' temperature .",
    "@xmath11 is given by ( kulkarni &  phinney 1998 ) , @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the time in days since the burst of gamma - rays , @xmath15 is the distance in mpc , and @xmath16 , the flux density at frequency @xmath17 .",
    "the energy in the particles and the magnetic field is the smallest when @xmath18 , the so - called `` equipartition '' temperature ( @xmath19 k ; readhead 1994 ) . the inferred energy increases sharply with increasing @xmath11 . for sn 1998bw ,",
    "even with @xmath20 , the inferred energy in the relativistic shock is @xmath21 erg which is already significant .",
    "if @xmath22 the inferred energy goes up by a factor of 500 and thus approaches the total energy release of typical sn ( @xmath23 erg ) . thus the condition @xmath24 is a reasonable inequality to use .",
    "this then leads to a lower limit on @xmath6 .",
    "we consider the shock to be relativistic when @xmath25 . for sn 1998bw ,",
    "kulkarni et al .",
    "( 1998c ) find @xmath26 .",
    "it is well known that prompt radio emission ( by this we mean a timescale of a few days ) is seen from type ib / ic sne . radio emission in type ii sne peaks on very long timescales ( months to years ) .",
    "no type ia sn has yet been detected in the radio .",
    "the reader is referred to weiler &  sramek ( 1988 ) and chevalier ( 1998 ) for recent reviews .",
    "thus the criterion of prompt radio emission ( equivalent to high @xmath11 , see eq .",
    "1 ) will naturally lead to selecting only type ib / ic sne .",
    "although slight differences may exist between type ib / ic radio sne ( van dyk et al .",
    "1993 ) they can be clearly distinguished from type ii sne not only on the basis of their prompt emission , but also from their steeper spectral indices @xmath27 ( where s@xmath28 ) and their steeper decay rates @xmath29 ( where s@xmath30 ) ( weiler & sramek 1988 ) after the peak is reached .",
    "indeed , at late times sn 1998bw seems to exhibit these same characteristics ( kulkarni et al .",
    "van dyk et al . ( 1993 ) first pointed out that the 6-cm spectral luminosities of the known type ib / c radio sne showed a small scatter about @xmath3110@xmath32 erg s@xmath33 hz@xmath33 and thus may be considered a `` standard candle '' .",
    "thus it is of interest to note that the peak radio luminosity of sn 1998bw is two orders of magnitude larger than the five previously studied type ib / ic sne .      in our physical picture",
    "above , we do not expect any long - lived x - ray emission since the synchrotron lifetime of x - ray emitting electrons is so short .",
    "the lack of x - ray afterglow from grb 980425 in the direction of sn 1998bw is consistent with this picture .      in the model we have adopted , the gamma - ray and the radio emission",
    "is powered by an energetic relativistic shock .",
    "is it likely that there is more than one shock ?",
    "our answer is no .",
    "there is no basis to believe or expect that the collapse of the progenitor core will result in multiple shocks .",
    "it is possible that the nascent pulsar or a black hole could be energetically important but the envelope matter surely will dampen down rapid temporal variability of the underlying source . from this discussion",
    "we conclude that there is only one relativistic shock .",
    "thus the gamma - ray burst profile should be very simple : a single pulse ( sp ) .",
    "multi - peak ( mp ) profiles are not a natural expectation of the adopted physical model .",
    "the light curve of grb 980425 ( figure [ fig:6707 ] ) is a simple single pulse ( sp ) with a @xmath34 sec rise ( hwhm ) and @xmath35 sec decay . like most grbs ( crider et al .",
    "1997 ; band 1997 ) , the harder emission precedes the softer emission with channel 3 ( 100 - 300 kev ) peaking @xmath36 sec before channel 1 ( 25 - 50 kev ) . unlike most grb light curves the profile of grb 980425 has a rounded maximum instead of a cusp .",
    "kulkarni et al .",
    "( 1998c ) noted that the minimum energy in the relativistic shock , @xmath37 is @xmath21 erg and that the true energy content could be as high as @xmath38 erg .",
    "even the lower value is a significant fraction of energy of the total supernova release of ordinary sne ( @xmath39 erg ) especially when one realizes that the mass within the relativistic shock ( @xmath40 ) is exceedingly small , @xmath41 \\sim 10^{-6}\\ , m_\\odot$ ] .",
    "it is indeed puzzling to find that the explosion can put so much energy in such a small amount of matter .",
    "curiously enough , a similarly small mass is invoked to explain c - grbs .",
    "clearly , a larger energy release in the supernova would favor a more energetic shock , and hence , increase the chance such a shock could produce a burst of @xmath7-rays . indeed , there are indications from the modeling of the light curve and the spectra that the energy release in sn 1998bw was @xmath42 erg ( woosley , eastman , & schmidt 1998 ; iwamoto et al .",
    "1998 ) , a factor of @xmath43 larger than the canonical sn .",
    "this then leads us to propose the final criterion : indications of more - than - normal release of energy .",
    "observationally , this release is manifested by large expansion speed which lead to the criterion of broad emission lines and bright optical luminosity .",
    "we now apply the above four criteria motivated by a specific physical model to proposed s - grbs .",
    "this includes associations proposed by wang &  wheeler ( 1998 ) and woosley , eastman , & schmidt ( 1998 ) .",
    "we searched for more potential grb - sn associations by cross - correlating the earlier watch and _ interplanetary network _",
    "( ipn ) localizations ( atteia et al .  1987 ;",
    "lund 1995 ; hurley et al .",
    "1997 ) with master catalogue of supernovae .",
    "we found no convincing associations in archival grb / sn data before the launch of the _ burst and source transient experiment _",
    "( batse ) .",
    "thus our total list remains at nine , seven from wang &  wheeler and two from woosley , eastman , & schmidt ( 1998 ) .",
    "we reject the following proposed associations : ( 1 ) sn 1996n / grb 960221 ( wang &  wheeler 1998 ) .",
    "the ipn data rule this association on spatial grounds alone .",
    "this lack of association was independently recognized by kippen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . ( 2 ) sn 1992ar / grb 920616 ( woosley et al .",
    "the associated grb appears not to exist in the batse 4b catalog ( meegan et al .",
    "1998 ) and furthermore , there are no other grbs within a month that are spatially coincident with the sn .",
    "( 3 ) sn 1998t / grb 980218 ( wang &  wheeler 1998 ) .",
    "this is ruled out on spatial grounds from the ipn data ( kippen et al .",
    "1998 ) .    in table",
    "[ tab : obs ] we summarize the proposed associations . they are ranked according to the viability of the association based on the four criteria discussed in the previous section . the pulse profile for each grb",
    "is characterized as either simple / single pulse ( sp ) or multipulse ( mp ) .",
    "the standard energy criterion of `` high energy '' and `` no high energy '' depending on presence or absence of emission above 300 kev ( pendleton et al .",
    "1997 ) is designated by he and nhe , respectively .",
    "the sne type was drawn from the literature as was the distance to the host galaxy .",
    "the isotropic gamma - ray energy release is computed from the publically available fluence ( batse 4b catalogue ; meegan et al .",
    "1998 ) and the assumed distance .",
    "it is unfortunate that crucial information  the early radio emission observations",
    " are missing for all but one sn ( 1994i ) .",
    "sn 1994i does have early radio emission ( iauc 5963 ; rupen et al .",
    "however , according to kippen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the associated candidate grb 940331 is more than 4-@xmath44 away from the location of sn 1994i .",
    "thus either the grb associated with this event is not observed by batse , or this event is not a s - grb .",
    "from observations ( primarily radio ) and analysis of sn 1998bw we have enumerated four criteria to identify s - grbs .",
    "we have attempted to see how well the proposed associations of s - grbs fare against these three criteria .",
    "unfortunately , we find the existing data are so sparse that we are unable to really judge if the proposed criteria are supported by the observations .    the small - number of candidate associations prohibit us from drawing any firm conclusions based on common characteristics .",
    "nonetheless it is of some interest to note that four of out top five candidate s - grbs ( the exception is # 6479 ) are single - pulsed ( sp ) bursts ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "we clarify that the ordering in table 1 did not use the morphology of the pulse profile in arriving at the rank .",
    "we remind the reader that roughly half of all batse bursts are sp and these mostly are sharp spikes ( @xmath45 1 sec ) or exhibit , a fast - rise followed by an exponential decay  the so - called `` freds '' .",
    "independent of our four criteria , the expected rate of s - grbs is constrained by the fact that this sub - class is expected , with the assumption of a standard candle energy release , to have a homogeneous euclidean ( @xmath46 = 0.5 ) brightness distribution . since there is a significant deviation from euclidean in the batse catalogue ( eg .",
    "fenimore et al .  1993 ) s - grbs can not comprise a majority fraction of the batse catalogue .",
    "indeed , as studies show ( eg .",
    "pendleton et al .",
    "1997 ) , a homogeneous population , chosen phenomenologically , can constitute at least @xmath47 of the batse grb population .    from the bepposax observations we know that at least 90% of sax - identified grbs have x - ray afterglow .",
    "thus , at least in the sax sample , the population of s - grbs is further constrained to be no more than 10% using the criterion of no x - ray afterglow .",
    "however , it is well known that sax does not trigger on short bursts , duration @xmath48 few seconds , and thus our statement only applies to the longer bursts .",
    "our first criterion would lead us to predict that any sn with bright and prompt radio emission ( implying a high @xmath11 ) as in sn 1998bw is necessarily preceded by a burst of gamma - rays .",
    "however , the sky is not routinely monitored for radio sn and thus this prediction has little practical consequence .",
    "on the other hand , a large fraction of the sky is monitored at gamma - ray energies and this is where our criterion of simple profiles could conceivably be of some use .",
    "unfortunately , the criterion of a single pulse is not very useful given that about half of the batse bursts are sp .",
    "as discussed above , at most @xmath49 of all bursts could be s - grbs .",
    "this forces us to conclude that s - grbs are only a certain sub - class of sps",
    ".    what could be the special characteristics of this sub - class of sps ?",
    "in search of this special sub - class we note that the profile of grb 980425 ( figure 1 ) exhibits a rounded maximum and is quite distinctive .",
    "a visual inspection of the batse 4b catalog shows that there are only 15 bursts with similar profiles ; we note that such bursts constitute 1% of the fraction of the batse bursts .",
    "interestingly , most of these bursts appear to have the same duration as grb 980425 , although this may be due bias in our selection .",
    "we end with some thoughts and speculation on the population of s - grbs . assuming the fluence of the grb 980425 is indicative of the subclass",
    ", we find a canonical @xmath7-ray energy of @xmath50 ergs .",
    "although batse triggers on flux ( rather than fluence ) 80% of bursts with fluence @xmath51 erg @xmath52 will be detected ( bloom , fenimore , & in t zand 1997 ) .",
    "thus batse can potentially probe the class of s - grbs out to @xmath53 mpc .",
    "van den bergh & tammann ( 1991 ) concluded that the rate of ib / ic is roughly half that of type ii supernovae .",
    "thus the expected rate of type ib / ic supernovae is 0.3 per day out to a distance of 100 @xmath54 .",
    "this can be compared to the daily rate of 2  3 grbs per day at the batse flux limit .",
    "thus , if all type ib / ic sne produced a s - grb then the fraction of s - grbs is 10% .",
    "this is consistent with the upper limit on the fraction due to the x - ray afterglow criterion found above .",
    "further progress requires observations .",
    "even with the poor localization of batse , a schmidt telescope equipped with large plates can be employed to search for sne out to a few hundred mpc .",
    "we suggest that such schmidt plate searches be conducted for those bursts which exhibit the simple pulse structure .",
    "finally , we end by noting the value of detecting _ and _ localizing the faintest bursts . at the faint end",
    ", s - grbs will dominate the number counts . from this perspective",
