    "the faint submm source counts suggest that a significant revision is needed to the optically derived star formation history of the universe ( steidel et al .",
    "1999 ) , with the addition of a population of highly reddened active star forming galaxies not seen in deep optical surveys ( chapman et al . 1999 ) . however , this conclusion hinges on the currently unknown redshift distribution of the faint submm sources .",
    "follow - up observations have shown that most faint submm sources are associated with very faint optical ( @xmath7 ) and near ir ( @xmath8 ) sources ( smail et al .",
    "1999a ) , in which case obtaining reliable optical redshifts is difficult .",
    "moreover , at these faint levels confusion in optical fields can be severe . at",

    "1999c , downes et al . 1999 , hughes et al .",
    "1998 ) . for comparison , the probability of detecting a radio source with @xmath10 in this same region is 0.04 ( richards 1999 ) .",
    "even crude estimates of source redshifts that do not rely on identification of the sources in the optical or near ir are fundamental to our understanding of the faint submm source population .",
    "we recently proposed the technique of using the radio - to - submm spectral index as a redshift indicator ( carilli and yun 1999 ) .",
    "this technique is based on the universal radio - to - far infrared ( fir ) correlation for star forming galaxies ( condon 1992 ) , with the extrapolation that the spectral shapes may be similar enough to be able to differentiate between low and high redshift objects .",
    "even a gross indication of the source redshift distribution provides critical constraints on models of the star formation history of the universe using submm source counts ( blain et al .",
    "carilli and yun ( 1999 ) presented empirical models for the relationship between @xmath1 and the observed spectral index between 1.4 and 350 ghz , @xmath0 , based on the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of arp 220 and m82 , plus semi - analytic models based on the equations in condon ( 1992 ) , assuming a dust spectrum comparable to that of m82 ( gsten et al . 1992 ) .",
    "we found that these simple models were in reasonable agreement with the few spectroscopically measured redshifts for high @xmath1 submm sources , and we discussed possible reasons for departure of sources from this relationship , including the presence of a radio loud agn , and cooling of the synchrotron emitting relativistic electrons due to inverse compton scattering off the microwave background radiation .",
    "a subsequent paper by blain ( 1999 ) showed that very low dust temperatures ( @xmath11 ) can also lead to departures from the standard relations .    in this paper",

    "@xmath1 relation using the observed seds of 17 low @xmath1 star forming galaxies .",
    "note that blain ( 1999 ) considered the logarithm of the flux density ratio between observed frequencies of 350 and 1.4 ghz while we use the spectral index .",
    "these quantities are simply related by a scale factor : log[@xmath12 = 2.4 .",
    "we use @xmath13 = 75 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 and q@xmath15 = 0.5 .",
    "most of the galaxies in our study come from the recent submm study of lisenfeld , isaak , & hills ( 1999 ) , which is a subsample of bright iras galaxies observed in co(10 ) by sanders , scoville , & soifer ( 1991 ) .",

    "we have augmented this sample with three other star forming galaxies with well sampled seds from 1.4 ghz to 25000 ghz ( m82 , iras 05189@xmath182524 , and ugc 5101 ) .",
    "the sources are listed in column 1 of table 1 .",
    "the process of deriving the redshift evolution of @xmath0 entails fitting accurate polynomials to the observed seds at cm through ir wavelengths , then using these polynomials to predict the change in @xmath0 with redshift ( carilli and yun 1999 ) .",
    "examples of the seds , plus polynomial fits , for four of the galaxies are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the fitting process is required to interpolate the discretely sampled data points to unsampled spectral regions . as with any interpolation process",
    ", errors will occur in unsampled regions , and the errors will increase as the sampling decreases .",
    "this is particularly true for the six sources in the sample with only one mm or submm measurement ( ngc 3110 , 5135 , 5256 , 5653 , 5936 , zw049 ) .",

    "blain ( 1999 ) has hypothesized that dust temperature may have an important impact on the scatter in the @xmath28 ",

    "if we remove the two outliers we find a significant decrease in the rms values , from 0.11 for the distribution in figure 2 , to 0.075 for the distribution in figure 4 , and the rms is roughly constant with @xmath50 .      the radio spectral indices from 330 mhz through 5 ghz for the sources listed in table  1 show a large scatter , from 0.2 to 0.9 .",
    "the canonical value for synchrotron emission from star forming galaxies is 0.8 ( condon 1992 ) .",

    "we compare the observed spectral indices between 1.4 and 5 ghz to those between 0.33 and 1.4 ghz ( columns 2 and 3 in table 1 ) .",
    "no evidence for systematic flattening of the spectra with increasing star forming activity is found for the majority of the galaxies , as would occur due to free - free absorption .",
    "however , the presence of a patchy absorbing medium could lead to complicated spectral shapes , and this alone is not a sufficient reason to rule out the importance of free - free absorption .",
    "one method used by condon et al . ( 1991 ) to investigate the possibility of free - free absorption at 1.4 ghz was to correct the radio spectra by assuming a constant radio spectral index of @xmath180.8 and normalizing to the observed flux densities at 5 ghz",
    ". this analysis will mitigate free - free absorption effects at least out to @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "we have investigated this possibility for the galaxies in our sample with 5 ghz detections .",
    "we find that the rms scatter at low redshift decreases only marginally , from 0.14 to 0.12 .",
    "given these results , and the fact that free - free opacity decreases quadratically with increasing frequency , we conclude that free - free absorption for rest frequencies above 1.4 ghz is not likely to be a dominant cause of scatter in the @xmath28  @xmath1 relationship .",

    "the @xmath55 model leads to a conservative lower limit to the median redshift of the sources of 2.05 , while the @xmath56 model leads to a median redshift of 2.68 .",

    "( 1999b ) that the majority of the faint submm sources are likely to be at @xmath57 , and that there is no prominent low - z tail in the distribution .",

    "below 1.4 ghz the spectrum appears to be dominated by a possible star forming disk seen on sub - kpc scales , while above 1.4 ghz the pc - scale agn component raises the total flux density by about a factor 2 ( taylor et al .",

    "( 1999 ) have pointed out that the dust spectrum of ngc 4418 is anomalous relative to the rest of their sample , with a low value of @xmath73 and a high dust temperature , leading to the unusual distribution for the source in the temperature - corrected curves shown in figure 4 .",
