    "in this paper we report on a new kind of combinatorial phenomenon in knot theory .",
    "our research was motivated by a desire to understand what the @xmath2 polynomial of an oriented link ` measures , ' i.e. , to find a natural ( for example , diagram - independent ) definition for it . while that problem remains wide open ( with the most promising approach being the gopakumar ",
    "ooguri  vafa conjecture  @xcite ) , we feel we did carry out an interesting case study with some surprising results .",
    "the homfly polynomial @xmath3 @xcite is an invariant of oriented links that specializes to the conway polynomial @xmath4 via the substitution @xmath5 .",
    "the latter is equivalent to the alexander polynomial  @xmath6 through @xmath7 .",
    "note that @xmath8 and @xmath9 share the same leading coefficient . in @xmath10 ,",
    "on the other hand , one finds several terms that contribute to the leading monomial of @xmath8 when we set @xmath11 .",
    "we will collectively refer to these as the _ top _ of the homfly polynomial . for homogeneous links @xcite ( which include all alternating and positive links )",
    ", the top can also be described as the sum of those terms that realize the @xmath1-degree of @xmath10 .",
    "a third , perhaps most adequate definition ( equivalent to the previous two when the diagram is homogeneous ) is that the top of @xmath10 is the coefficient of @xmath12 in @xmath10 , where @xmath13 is the number of crossings and @xmath14 is the number of seifert circles , respectively , in a diagram of the link . here _",
    "seifert circles _ are the simple closed curves that result when we smooth every crossing of a link diagram in the orientation - preserving way .",
    "seifert circles are the vertices of the _ seifert graph _ ,",
    "in which there is an edge between two of them for every crossing where they meet .",
    "a seifert graph is always bipartite , which is the reason why it can be used in the standard construction of an _ oriented _ spanning surface for a link .",
    "let @xmath15 be a homogeneous link diagram @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to describe the top of the associated homfly polynomial @xmath16 in terms of the seifert graph of @xmath15 . by definition",
    ", @xmath15 decomposes as a so - called star product of special alternating link diagrams . on the level of seifert graphs , a star product corresponds to a block sum . here",
    "a _ block sum _ of two connected graphs ( blocks ) is a one - point union .",
    "each special alternating component of @xmath15 is represented by a block in the seifert graph .",
    "every block has a sign , i.e. , edges in the same block stand for crossings of the same sign ( hence the term ` homogeneous ' ) .",
    "a theorem of murasugi and przytycki @xcite says that the top of the homfly polynomial ( in the sense of our third description above ) behaves multiplicatively under star product .",
    "thus it suffices for us to describe the top of @xmath10 for special alternating links . since",
    "such links are either positive or negative , and for any link @xmath17 and its mirror image  @xmath18 we have @xmath19 , we may , without loss of generality , concentrate on positive special alternating links only .",
    "@xmath20 at 490 280 @xmath21 at 100 110 @xmath22 at 630 190 , its planar dual @xmath23 , and associated special alternating link @xmath24 .",
    "the last panel shows the three objects together.,title=\"fig : \" ]    a positive special alternating link diagram is , up to isotopy , uniquely described by its seifert graph ( as a plane graph ) .",
    "hence most of our discussion focuses on a connected plane bipartite graph @xmath25 which gives rise ( by the median construction ) to the positive special alternating link @xmath24 .",
    "see figure [ fig : k32 ] for an example .",
    "alexander postnikov @xcite has recently developed a beautiful theory of ( not necessarily planar ) bipartite graphs .",
    "the gist of this paper is the realization that some of his ideas are closely related to knot theory .",
    "postnikov associates a _",
    "root polytope _",
    "@xmath26 to any bipartite graph @xmath25 , constructed as follows .",
    "denote the color classes of @xmath25 by @xmath27 and @xmath28 and take the convex hull , in @xmath29 , of the vectors  @xmath30 for all edges @xmath31 of @xmath25 .",
    "here @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the standard generators associated to @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "the result is an @xmath36-dimensional polytope so that , of course , edges of @xmath25 translate to vertices of @xmath26 .",
    "it is also not hard to show that a set of vertices of @xmath26 is affinely independent if and only if the corresponding edges form a cycle - free subgraph of @xmath25 . in particular",
    ", there is a one - to - one correspondence between maximal simplices formed by vertices of @xmath26 and spanning trees of @xmath25 .",
    "a _ triangulation _ of @xmath26 is a collection of maximal simplices so that their union is the entire root polytope and any two of them intersect in a common face .",
    "( note how it is not allowed to introduce new vertices when we triangulate a polytope . )",
    "our first result provides a way to triangulate @xmath26 in the case when @xmath25 is a plane graph .",
    "let us orient the dual graph @xmath23 so that each of its edges has an element of @xmath27 to the right and an element of @xmath28 to the left .",
    "after fixing a root  @xmath20 ( a vertex of @xmath23 ) arbitrarily , we consider _ spanning arborescences _ rooted at @xmath20 .",
    "these are those spanning trees of @xmath23 in which each edge points away from @xmath20 .",
    "each spanning arborescence has a dual spanning tree in @xmath25 and we claim the following .",
    "[ thm : triang ] let @xmath25 be a connected plane bipartite graph . fix a root @xmath20 and consider all spanning arborescences of @xmath23 rooted at @xmath20 , as well as the spanning trees of @xmath25 dual to them .",
    "then , the collection of those simplices in the root polytope @xmath26 that correspond to the latter forms a triangulation of @xmath26 .",
    "a triangulation of a polytope is an instance of a pure simplicial complex , i.e. , one in which all maximal simplices have the same dimension . to any @xmath37-dimensional simplicial complex ,",
    "it is customary to associate the _ _",
    "@xmath38-vector__-vector , as well as the @xmath0-vector below , may be more appropriately called a polynomial .",
    "however the vector terminology is so common in combinatorics that we decided to keep it . ]",
    "@xmath39 where @xmath40 , for @xmath41 , is the number of @xmath42-dimensional simplices in the complex .",
    "the _ @xmath0-vector _ of the same complex is defined as @xmath43 .",
    "the latter notion becomes significant ( for example , it has positive coefficients ) for so - called _ shellable complexes _",
    ", that is complexes with a shelling order . here",
    "a _ shelling order _ of a pure simplicial complex , @xmath44 , lists the maximal simplices in such a way that each @xmath45 , @xmath46 , intersects the set  @xmath47 in a union of @xmath48 codimension one faces .",
    "we always have @xmath49 but assume as part of the definition that @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
    "whether such an order exists is a subtle question , but when it does , it is not hard to show @xcite that @xmath52    the homfly polynomial , like most knot polynomials , is usually computed via successive applications of a skein relation .",
    "the process is captured by a so - called _",
    "computation tree_. the nodes of the computation tree are link diagrams with the original diagram playing the role of root .",
    "edges in the tree correspond to simple local modifications of the diagrams . for us ,",
    "the relevant skein relation is @xmath53{skeinpos.eps}}=v^2p_{\\includegraphics[totalheight=8pt]{skeinneg.eps}}+vzp_{\\includegraphics[totalheight=8pt]{skeinsmooth.eps}},\\ ] ] coupled with the initial condition @xmath54{circle.eps}}=1 $ ] for the homfly polynomial of the unknot .",
    "thus the computation tree is a rooted binary tree in which every non - leaf node has two descendants , resulting from either _ changing _ or _ smoothing _ a crossing . a priori",
    ", the crossings that we operate on can be chosen quite freely .",
    "the only restriction is that the leaves of the tree should be diagrams of the unknot , or of other links whose homfly polynomials are known .",
    "now , the main idea of the paper is to use the spanning arborescences above to construct a computation tree @xmath55 for @xmath56 . smoothing a crossing is equivalent to removing the corresponding edge from the seifert graph .",
    "we can also keep track of crossing changes by , say , making the corresponding edge dotted .",
    "thus each vertex of the tree will be described by a subgraph of @xmath25 with some dotted edges . to build @xmath55 ,",
    "first we will use a backtrack algorithm to enumerate all arborescences of @xmath23 .",
    "the subgraphs giving rise to the vertices of @xmath55 will be their duals and the tree structure ( as well as the dotted edges ) will reflect the steps in the algorithm .",
    "the leaves of the tree @xmath55 will arise from two kinds of subgraphs : either a spanning tree of @xmath25 , which corresponds to an unknot diagram , or a subgraph so that along its ` outside contour , ' every other edge is dotted .",
    "we will not compute the homfly polynomials associated to the latter ( so as far as the ` full ' homfly polynomial is concerned , @xmath55 remains incomplete ) , but we will prove that these latter leaves do not contribute to the top of @xmath56 .",
    "by contrast , the spanning trees only contribute to the top .",
    "in fact , each gives a single monomial in which the exponent of @xmath57 is determined by the number of dotted edges .",
    "the tree @xmath55 has a natural embedding in the plane by always drawing the result of smoothing to the right and the result of crossing change to the left .",
    "in particular , the leaves of @xmath55 have a natural order from right to left . as to the leaves that belong to spanning trees ,    1 .   by theorem [ thm : triang ]",
    ", they correspond to the maximal simplices in a triangulation of @xmath26 and 2 .",
    "we claim that the right - to - left order is a shelling order for the triangulation .    from this",
    ", the following is immediate .",
    "the triangulation described in theorem [ thm : triang ] is shellable .",
    "furthermore , as we build @xmath26 simplex - by - simplex using the shelling order , the number @xmath48 of facets along which the simplex @xmath45 is attached is exactly the number of dotted edges in the corresponding tree . from this our first main result",
    "follows :    [ thm : homfly = h ] for any connected plane bipartite graph @xmath25 with @xmath14 vertices and @xmath13 edges , the top of the homfly polynomial @xmath58 ( of the positive special alternating link  @xmath24 ) is @xmath59 where @xmath0 is the @xmath0-vector of the triangulation , given in theorem [ thm : triang ] , of the root polytope  @xmath26",
    ".    in general , different triangulations of the same polytope can have different @xmath0-vectors .",
    "for instance , the number of maximal simplices , i.e. , the sum of the coefficients in the @xmath0-vector , may vary .",
    "that can not occur for a root polytope because maximal simplices share the same volume .",
    "in fact , much more is true : any two triangulations of @xmath26 have the same @xmath38-vector and hence the same @xmath0-vector .",
    "we learned this fact from a. postnikov who gave a short proof using total unimodularity and the ehrhart polynomial .",
    "we hope to come back to this point in a future joint paper .",
    "our other main theorem gives a third description of the two quantities that are equated in theorem  [ thm : homfly = h ] .",
    "it is given in terms of _ parking functions _ associated to @xmath23 , as defined by postnikov and shapiro @xcite .",
    "having fixed a root @xmath20 in @xmath23 , parking functions are of the form  @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the vertex set of @xmath23 .",
    "see definition [ def : parking ] for the details .",
    "let us associate the _ index _ @xmath62 to the parking function  @xmath63 .",
    "if @xmath64 denotes the set of parking functions , then let the _ parking function enumerator _",
    "be @xmath65    [ thm : homfly = park ] for any connected plane bipartite graph @xmath25 with @xmath14 vertices and @xmath13 edges , the top of the homfly polynomial @xmath58 is equal to @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the parking function enumerator of the directed graph @xmath23 .",
    "a consequence of the theorem is the fact that @xmath68 is independent of the choice of @xmath20 . as a biproduct of our arguments",
    ", we obtain a bijection between spanning arborescences of @xmath23 rooted at @xmath20 and parking functions defined on @xmath69 .",
    "it has been known @xcite that those two sets have the same cardinality .",
    "our bijection is similar to , but appears not to be a special case of , those in the literature @xcite .",
    "we also obtain    [ cor : h = p ] let @xmath25 be a connected plane bipartite graph on @xmath14 vertices with planar dual @xmath23 .",
    "then the @xmath0-vector @xmath70 of any triangulation of the root polytope  @xmath26 and the parking function enumerator @xmath68 of @xmath23 satisfy @xmath71    the combinatorial setup used in this paper yields yet another description of the top of @xmath56 , this time as the _ interior polynomial _",
    "@xcite of the hypergraph @xmath72 .",
    "[ int_conj ] this last claim is only conjecturally true , but once it is proved , it will provide a hitherto unknown connection between the homfly polynomial and heegaard floer homology .",
    "namely , the interior polynomial can be computed from the so - called hypertree polytope ( see @xcite for definitions ) and the latter can be thought of as the heegaard floer homology of a certain sutured manifold in order to be more precise , let us note that the sutured manifold in question is a handlebody , so that the set of @xmath73 structures supporting the sutured floer homology is a subset of a lattice .",
    "this set is isomorphic to the set of lattice points in the hypertree polytope .",
    "furthermore , the homology group corresponding to each @xmath73 structure in the support is @xmath74 . ]",
    "due to theorem  [ thm : homfly = h ] , the problem of reading ( some ) homfly coefficients out of heegaard floer homology is reduced to the open combinatorial problem that the @xmath0-vector ( of a triangulation of the root polytope @xmath26 of the connected bipartite graph @xmath25 ) is equivalent to the interior polynomial ( of the hypergraph @xmath72 , where @xmath28 and @xmath27 are the color classes of @xmath25 ) .",
    "the sutured manifold mentioned above is the complement of a seifert surface .",
    "however this surface is bounded not by @xmath24 but by a related link .",
    "one may wish to consider instead the minimum genus seifert surface @xmath75 for @xmath24 that deformation retracts to @xmath25 .",
    "the sutured floer homology @xmath76 of the complement of @xmath75 is also a hypertree polytope ( in the sense of footnote [ foot ] ) but of the wrong hypergraph , whose interior polynomial is different from the top of @xmath56 . on the other hand , the set @xmath77 of parking functions can be thought of as a rearrangement and @xmath77 both have dimension @xmath78 .",
    "] of @xmath76 and thus theorem [ thm : homfly = park ] also becomes a way of obtaining information on the homfly polynomial from heegaard floer homology .",

'",
    "morton s estimate above is well known to be sharp for homogeneous link diagrams .",
    "this claim also follows from our main result on special alternating links ( as stated in theorems [ thm : homfly = h ] and [ thm : homfly = park ] , although the statement in theorem [ thm : treetop ] suffices as well ) and the following fact .",
    "[ thm : mp ] let @xmath153 and @xmath154 be oriented link diagrams so that they have @xmath155 and @xmath156 crossings , respectively , as well as @xmath157 and @xmath158 seifert circles , respectively .",
    "let us form a star product @xmath159 of @xmath153 and @xmath154 ( along any pair of type i seifert circles and using any arrangement of the crossings along the new type ii seifert circle ) .",
    "then @xmath159 has @xmath160 crossings and @xmath161 seifert circles , and the coefficient of @xmath162 in @xmath163 is the product of the coefficients of @xmath164 in @xmath165 and that of @xmath166 in @xmath167 .    for a link @xmath17 that can be presented with a homogeneous diagram with @xmath13 crossings and @xmath14 seifert circles ,",
    "the _ top of the homfly polynomial _ is the polynomial in @xmath57 that is the coefficient of @xmath12 in @xmath168 .    when we combine the next theorem with theorem [ thm : mp ]",
    ", it follows that for any homogeneous link , all coefficients in the top of the homfly polynomial have the same sign .",
    "in particular , they do not cancel when we pass to the alexander polynomial @xmath169 , rather their sum becomes the leading coefficient in @xmath9 .",
    "[ thm : treetop ] for a connected plane bipartite graph @xmath25 of @xmath14 vertices and @xmath13 edges , the top of the homfly polynomial  @xmath56 is expressed in terms of the computation tree @xmath55 as the sum to which each type  i leaf with @xmath42 negative crossings ( which appear as skipped edges in @xmath123 and as dotted edges in @xmath149 ) , contributes the monomial @xmath170 .",
    "if we label each edge of @xmath55 connecting a node to its right descendant with @xmath171 and each edge leading to a left descendant with @xmath172 , then @xmath55 can be used to compute the homfly polynomial associated to the root as the sum of the following terms : for each leaf , take the homfly polynomial of the corresponding link and multiply it with the product of the edge labels along the unique path between the leaf and the root .",
    "type i leaves , where the corresponding subgraph is a spanning tree of @xmath25 , are diagrams of the unknot . therefore , since @xmath54{circle.eps}}=1 $ ] , type i leaves contribute a single monomial , namely the product of the appropriate edge labels .",
    "each spanning tree contains @xmath173 edges .",
    "so in order to reach a type i leaf , one needs to remove @xmath152 edges , that is , on the way from the root to the leaf , one has to take a step to the right exactly @xmath152 times .",
    "if the link diagram at the leaf contains @xmath42 negative crossings , that means that we took a step to the left @xmath42 times .",
    "hence the contribution to the homfly polynomial of the leaf is @xmath174 .",
    "note that the exponent of @xmath1 here is the maximum allowed by theorem [ thm : morton ] .",
    "the theorem will obviously follow once we make sure that the type ii leaves of the computation tree do not contribute to the top of @xmath56 .",
    "this is a consequence of proposition [ biglemma ] below by the following remarks .    along any path from the root of @xmath55 to a node in the tree , the exponent of @xmath1 in the product of the corresponding edge labels is the number of steps taken to the right .",
    "that number agrees with the amount @xmath175 by which the number of crossings decreased along the path .",
    "the number @xmath14 of seifert circles is constant throughout @xmath55 .",
    "hence in order for the node to contribute terms containing @xmath12 to @xmath56 , the homfly polynomial associated to the node has to contain terms with @xmath176 in them .",
    "the estimate in proposition [ biglemma ] rules that out for type ii leaves .",
    "the proposition below describes some characteristics of the link diagrams that arise after ( in the description of @xmath149 at the beginning of this section ) an alternating contour has been achieved .",
    "there is however an extra assumption in the proposition , namely that the outside region at this stage does not touch itself over an edge of @xmath25 .",
    "general type  ii leaves of @xmath55 are obtained by connecting diagrams described in the proposition in a tree - like fashion . here by connecting , we mean joining the corresponding ( embedded ) seifert graphs by paths of edges ( some of which may be dotted ) . in terms of link diagrams , that translates to joining by a sequence of ( @xmath117 or more ) bigons , which is just a complicated way of taking a connected sum .",
    "because the homfly polynomial is multiplicative under connected sums , the estimate discussed in the previous paragraph follows for general type ii leaves from the claim below by a short inductive argument ( it even gets stronger as the number of components in the alternating contour increases ) .",
    "[ biglemma ] let the oriented link diagram @xmath15 contain @xmath13 crossings and @xmath14 seifert circles .",
    "assume that there exists a region @xmath113 in the complement @xmath177 with the following property : there are at least two arcs of @xmath15 bounding @xmath113 and they are alternately oriented clockwise and counterclockwise , so that at each crossing along @xmath178 , the counterclockwise arc passes over the clockwise one .",
    "we also assume that near each crossing along @xmath178 , only one quadrant formed by @xmath15 belongs to @xmath113 .",
    "( see figure  [ fig : outer_arcs ] . ) then , in any term of the corresponding homfly polynomial @xmath89 , the exponent of @xmath1 is at most @xmath179 .",

    "one sees immediately that a reidemeister i - a move decreases both the number of seifert circles and the number of crossings by one .",

    "since the number of crossings is reduced by two , a cyclic reidemeister ii - a move is either a good or a fair move .    under a ( global ) noncyclic reidemeister ii - a move , the configuration of seifert circles does not change .",

    "let us number the @xmath347 points of @xmath348 counterclockwise around @xmath114 .",
    "a quick examination of figure [ fig : outer_arcs ] shows that the modulo @xmath349 remainder class of each point tells exactly if it is a start- or an endpoint and whether of an over - arc or an under - arc . for any arc of @xmath15 across the interior of @xmath114 that follows right after an outer over - arc ,",
