    "the idea of strange quark matter ( sqm ) as the ground state of nuclear matter , proposed by bodmer - witten - terazawa  @xcite , and enforced by farhi and jaffe  @xcite , has continued alive during the last three decades .",
    "even more exciting are the results about the theoretical possibility to have the sqm in a neutral paired phase - the so - called color flavor locked ( cfl ) phase  @xcite , where all quark flavors and colors are paired .",
    "the true ground state of matter would be in this paired phase  @xcite , which is expected to occur at high densities and low temperatures .",
    "if the sqm or cfl phases are the fundamental states of matter , one could expect them to be present inside compact objects , such as quark or hybrid stars  @xcite , or in the even more exotic small quark lumps named strangelets .",
    "the formation of these lumps could be caused by the collision of compact stars , supernova explosions or primary cosmic rays from strange stars .",
    "they could even be produced in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion colliders , such as the rhic  @xcite , and in the large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiments , confirming with their signatures the formation of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "furthermore , experiments pointing to cosmic rays are on the search for strangelets  @xcite .    in early works",
    "@xcite , and in more recent papers  @xcite , several studies on sqm in the framework of the phenomenological mit bag model , and on the properties of strange stars and strangelets , have been tackled . in particular , they have analyzed the finite size effects of strangelets and discussed their stability at @xmath2 with an energy per baryon lower than the corresponding one of the iron isotope @xmath0fe , the most stable nucleus known in nature . at @xmath3 , strangelets would be in metastable states , but even if they survive @xmath4 milliseconds , their signatures would be very important for relativistic heavy - ion collider experiments  @xcite .",
    "the above studies also suggest that the radii @xmath5 of spherical strangelets have a dependence with the baryon number @xmath6 of the form @xmath7",
    "@xcite , where @xmath8 is the reduced strangelet radius , which is approximately equal to 1.12  fm for the nucleus in the atmosphere .",
    "these estimates could be of great interest in the search of strangelets upcoming from cosmic rays and reaching the earth s atmosphere .",
    "for example , the mean free path of strangelets in the atmosphere strongly depends on their radii  @xcite .",
    "an interesting characteristic of strangelets arises from their relatively low baryon numbers . for @xmath9 , electrons ( positrons )",
    "can not be trapped and mixed with quarks inside strangelets due to their small compton s wavelength compared to the radius of strangelets  @xcite .",
    "this implies that electric charge neutrality is in general no longer ensured , opposite to what happens in strange stars .",
    "a net nonzero electric charge for strangelets is an important parameter to be measured in order to clarify whether their existence and stability are possible in the universe , and to establish definite conclusions on the qgp formation .",
    "the sign of the electric charge will also give us information about the particle composition , and some authors even attempt to propose possible epic cataclysmic scenarios depending on it : positively charged strangelets would repel ordinary nuclei , but negatively charged ones would attract them , turning into strange nuclei , so that the normal matter we know would change , leading to a great disaster  @xcite .",
    "most of the experiments searching for strangelets are sensitive only to low baryon number values ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "thus , it is important to know their theoretical properties .",
    "since qcd equations can not be solved analytically , nor by perturbative methods , we shall use in our study the bag model , which treats quarks ( anti - quarks ) as a noninteracting particles confined into a spherical well .",
    "the latter may be thought as an external parameter that realizes the color confinement of quarks and gluons .",
    "several results about the stability , radius and electric charge of strangelets can be obtained from the liquid drop model ( ldm )  @xcite , widely used in hadron physics . in this case , strangelets are described as non - interacting fermi and gluon gases with a modified state density , using the multiple reflection expansion method ( mrem ) developed by balian and bloch  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in astrophysical scenarios as well as in heavy ion colliders ,",
    "the magnetic field is an important physical quantity .",
    "pulsars , magnetars , neutron stars , and the emission of intense sources of x - rays could be associated to compact objects with an intense magnetic field at the surface around @xmath11  g  @xcite . in the interior of these compact objects ,",
    "the equipartition theorem predicts magnetic fields of the order of @xmath12  g  @xcite .",
    "recent studies also indicate that very intense magnetic fields , reaching values of  @xmath12  g , might be generated in heavy ion colliders  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study the main properties of strangelets at finite temperature in the presence of a strong magnetic field .",
    "our analysis is done within the framework of the bag model , and using the ldm approximation  @xcite . by including temperature effects",
    ", our results can be applicable to astrophysical as well as heavy - ion collider environments . in order to take account of the finite size effects ,",
    "we also consider nonzero quark masses and the effects of the magnetic field and temperature on the surface and curvature energy density corrections to the quark and gluon gas .",
    "we then aim at quantifying the relevant parameters in the characterization of strangelets and their stability .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we present the general thermodynamical expressions to describe strangelets at finite density and temperature in the presence of a strong magnetic field .",
    "we also discuss the criterium of mechanical equilibrium based on the minimization of the free energy , and briefly address the issue of the debye screening of the strangelet electric charge .",
    "this effect , although not relevant for paired mcfl ( cfl ) strangelets , it is of major importance in determining the total charge of unpaired msqm ( sqm ) strangelets . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we present the numerical results for the main properties of msqm and mcfl strangelets , namely , their energy per baryon , radius and charge .",
    "we also study how the critical baryon number , below which strangelets are unstable , depends on several input parameters .",
    "finally , our concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "the phenomenological mit bag model has been widely used to describe strangelets with low baryon numbers  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that surface and curvature phenomena are indeed important and should be considered . in particular ,",
    "surface and curvature corrections to the thermodynamical potential , energy and particle density play an important role on their stability at low baryon number  @xcite . at high baryon number ,",
    "these quantities approach asymptotically the bulk limit , in which the surface and curvature properties are negligible .",
    "this leads to an unbound phase of sqm , which has been widely studied in order to get a more comprehensive understanding of the interior of neutron and hybrid stars .    to consider the effects of the magnetic field on the thermodynamical properties of strangelets , we first need to know the energy spectrum of the particles involved in the system .",
    "we assume that our system is under the action of a constant and homogeneous magnetic field @xmath15 , guided in the @xmath16-direction .",
    "the energy levels are quantized by landau levels in the plane perpendicular to the field so that the energy spectrum is  @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 @xmath19 are the quark masses , @xmath20 , the quantity @xmath21 indexes the landau level , @xmath22 are the quark spin projections onto the magnetic field direction , @xmath23 are the critical magnetic fields and @xmath24 denote the quark electric charges .    in the absence of a magnetic field , strangelets can be considered as spherical drops , characterized by their volume @xmath25 , surface area @xmath26 and extrinsic curvature @xmath27 where @xmath5 is the radius of the sphere .",
    "on the other hand , in the presence of strong magnetic fields ( @xmath28  g ) , strangelets are expected to loose their sphericity due to the breaking of the spatial rotational symmetry , which also leads to the splitting of the parallel and perpendicular ( to the field direction ) pressure components  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in our study we shall assume a spherical shape for strangelets , which turns out to be a good approximation for @xmath29  g. deformed nonmagnetized strangelets have been considered , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite , showing that spherical strangelets exhibit an energy per baryon lower than the deformed ones , and thus being more stable .",
    "when dealing with massive @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 quarks , as well as with a gluon gas , the general expression for the thermodynamical potential can be written as @xmath33.\\label{ototal}\\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the quantity @xmath34 takes into account the gluon contribution to the thermodynamical potential , while @xmath35 corresponds to the quark @xmath36 ( anti - quark @xmath37 ) contribution .",
    "gluons , being massless particles , do not contribute to the surface corrections   @xcite .",
    "up to one - loop approximation , the bulk and curvature gluon terms can be analytically obtained and read @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the gluon statistical weight .",
    "the term @xmath40 accounts for the bag energy , with @xmath41 being interpreted as a vacuum pressure that realizes the color confinement of quarks .",
    "the sum in the last three terms of eq .",
    "is over all quark flavors .    in the one - loop approximation , the bulk statistical contribution to the quark thermodynamical potential given in eq .",
    "reads @xmath42 where @xmath43 represents the distribution function of particles ( @xmath44 ) and anti - particles ( @xmath45 ) at the temperature @xmath46 ; @xmath47 is the quark statistical weight and @xmath48 is the chemical potential per gas flavor .",
    "the bulk thermodynamical properties of sqm  @xcite and msqm  @xcite have been studied in the astrophysical context , which is of great importance in describing the equation of state of the quark gas , as well as the mass - radius relation for quark stars .",
    "the surface correction effects for quarks given in eq .   can be written as  @xcite @xmath49 the factor @xmath50 takes into account the modification of the state density within the mrem .",
    "for massless particles , it vanishes even at finite temperature . for massive particles , their densities on the surface remains always negative , i.e. , particles shy away from the surface as a consequence of the boundary condition in the bag model",
    ". we also note that , in the limit @xmath2 , and neglecting the @xmath30 and @xmath31 quark masses , eq",
    ".   leads to the expression obtained by berger and jaffe  @xcite .    in an analogous fashion ,",
    "the curvature energy density correction to the thermodynamical potential of quarks can be written as  @xcite : @xmath51 in this case , the factor @xmath52 has been derived  @xcite to fit the shell model .    since the anisotropy in the spectrum , imposed by the presence of a magnetic field , quantizes the energy states of every particle , the integration over @xmath53 in eqs .",
    ", and are to be replaced by the rule @xmath54 where the sum over landau levels is limited up to @xmath55,\\ ] ] due to the fact that the fermi momenta must be real - valued quantities  @xcite . here",
    "we have denoted by @xmath56 the dimensionless quark chemical potentials and @xmath57 $ ] the integer part of the real number @xmath58 .",
    "the role of the magnetic field in the quantities associated to surface and curvature phenomena has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . due to the presence of a magnetic field",
    "these quantities exhibit divergences for the ground - state landau level ( @xmath59 ) . indeed , when @xmath60 , the surface contribution of eq",
    ".   diverges logarithmically as @xmath61 , while the curvature energy density given in eq .   diverges as @xmath62 . since these divergences only appear in the limit @xmath60 , they can be removed by introducing an infrared cutoff in @xmath63  @xcite . ] . above this cutoff ,",
    "the surface and curvature terms are then numerically well - behaved quantities .    to study the stability of strangelets",
    "the free energy must be minimized .",
    "this minimum represents the most stable configuration that the quark droplet can reach .",

    "the entropy @xmath71 contains the bulk , surface and curvature contributions , @xmath72 respectively .",
    "as electrons ( positrons ) are forbidden to coexist with quarks in strangelets due to their small radii , electric charge neutrality is never ensured .",
    "this is an important feature in their detection .",
    "the electric charge , derived from the free charge distribution , is given by the expression @xmath73 , where @xmath74    for strangelets , however , the effects of the debye screening are not negligible and should be taken into account  @xcite .",
    "the strangelet charge distribution will depend on the debye screening length @xmath75 , @xmath76 by solving poisson s equation in the thomas - fermi approximation , the screened volumetric charge is then calculated as  @xcite @xmath77,\\ ] ] and the total electric charge becomes @xmath78 the corresponding coulomb energy of the strangelet is given by  @xcite @xmath79,\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which should be added to the total energy of the system .",
    "finally , it is worthwhile to mention that , in the study of strange stars , one can derive from eq .",
    "all the thermodynamical bulk properties and the equation of state ( eos ) of the system . in this case , the baryon number @xmath6 is a huge quantity ( @xmath80 ) so that the surface and curvature contributions can be safely neglected . on the other hand , to describe the mechanical equilibrium configurations of strangelets , where @xmath81 , the finite size effects , like the surface tension in eq .   and",
    "the curvature energy density in eq .  , play an important role in determining their properties .",
    "these terms are also important in the study of the quark - hadron phase transition  @xcite .",
    "in this section we solve numerically eq .  , which guarantees the mechanical equilibrium of strangelets .",
    "our aim is to study the energy per baryon for strangelets in the msqm and mcfl phases as a function of the baryon number @xmath6 , bag energy density , the magnetic field @xmath15 , temperature @xmath46 and gap parameter .",
    "we shall compare our results with the case of zero magnetic field , and also compute the radius of strangelets and their electric charge as a function of the baryon number .",
    "first we consider strangelets formed from unpaired msqm , and then we study those corresponding to the paired mcfl phase .",
    "strangelets with @xmath82 require zero electron and positron number densities .",
    "if they are formed from sqm or msqm , the @xmath83-equilibrium condition implies the equality of chemical potentials : @xmath84 . in the presence of a magnetic field , however , the latter condition does not imply the equality of bulk particle densities @xmath85 in msqm strangelets .",
    "indeed , we recall that , at @xmath2 , @xmath86 where @xmath87 correspond to the @xmath16-component of the magnetic fermi momenta and the magnetic mass , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the presence of @xmath88 in the fermi momenta and @xmath89 in the particle densities implies that , despite the chemical potential equalities , the particle densities should be different for every flavor .",

    "the curves show that temperature always tends to decrease the electric charge . in the bulk",
    ", the equality of quark densities implies zero electric charge contribution .",
    "therefore , these strangelets are characterized only by their surface electric charge distribution .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , the magnetic field also tends to decrease the surface electric charge .",
    "when @xmath6 is large , the behavior of @xmath126 as a function of @xmath6 is @xmath150  @xcite for nonmagnetized cfl strangelets , while its characteristic value is @xmath151 for mcfl strangelets .",
    "strangelets from msqm and mcfl have been studied within the mit bag model and the ldm framework .",
    "a comparison with sqm and cfl strangelets for massive quarks has been presented .",
    "we have examined how the stability and size of quark lumps are modified by the temperature and the presence of a strong magnetic field .",
    "while temperature tends to destabilize strangelets , the magnetic field acts in the opposite direction .",
    "any nonvanishing temperature contributes to an increase of the energy per baryon @xmath101 , which measures how stable are strangelets when compared to the isotope @xmath0fe , or any other given pattern , such as neutrons , pions or @xmath152-particles .",
    "on the other hand , the magnetic field enhances their stability , both in bulk and surface .",
    "strangelets in the mcfl and cfl phases show more stability than unpaired strangelets , as expected from the gap energy and pairing of quarks .",
    "the stability of strangelets at zero and finite temperature strongly depends on several parameters and , particularly , on the bag constant , strange quark mass , gap parameter , and the magnetic field .",
    "there exists a critical baryon number @xmath110 below which strangelets are metastable states , and can decay and radiate particles from their surface , even at @xmath2 .",
    "the critical baryon number increases with @xmath41 , @xmath133 and @xmath46 , but is a decreasing function of the magnetic field @xmath15 and the gap parameter @xmath134 .",
    "these results , nevertheless , should be taken with care due to the approximate nature of the liquid drop and bag models .",
    "the radii of strangelets were also studied in order to have an estimate of their size . as the pairing gap increases , the radii of strangelets get larger , as in the case of compact objects  @xcite .",
    "magnetized strangelets turn out to have a radius bigger than nonmagnetized ones , since the magnetic field tends to relax the surface tension , thus increasing the strangelet radius .",
    "finally , we have also found that the charge neutrality of strangelets is never ensured and , in the presence of the magnetic field , strangelets are always positively charged .",
    "therefore a nonvanishing electric charge may constitute the main characteristic to be searched for in experiments or in the detection of strangelets from astrophysical sources .",
    "unlike mcfl ( cfl ) strangelets , which are neutral in bulk , unpaired msqm ( sqm ) strangelets have a contribution to the electric charge due to the screened bulk charge .",
    "the relation @xmath153 represents another characteristic that could distinguish the phase of strange quark matter present in strangelets . for large @xmath6 , msqm and sqm strangelet electric charge exhibits the behavior @xmath127 ( attaining @xmath128 asymptotically ) , whereas for mcfl and cfl strangelets , the ratio @xmath154 reaches a constant value . these could be striking properties in their detection either in cosmic rays or in heavy - ion collider experiments .",
