    "in the atmosphere of the sun and of the stars similar to it , several processes take place , which make the temperature of the atmosphere higher than it would be if radiative equilibrium held .",
    "such non  radiative heating mechanisms are powered by convection and magnetic field . in the outer layers of these stars",
    ", the temperature is increasing towards the surface , and the main cooling mechanism is radiative loss through strong resonance lines , such as ca ii h and k , mg ii h and k , h@xmath0 .",
    "( see e.g. * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "this region is referred to as chromosphere , the radiation emitted in it is called chromospheric activity ( hereafter ca ) , and the strength of the emission cores in some of the aforementioned resonance lines are a good ca indicator .",
    "solar  type stars loose angular momentum due to magnetised stellar winds , and ca is believed to decay with time as a consequence . this trend is superimposed to short term ca variations , such as those that caused the maunder  minimum in the sun , activity cycles equivalent to the 11year long solar one , and , in the most active stars , rotational modulation @xcite .    due to its decay , ca is a potential age indicator and several efforts have been undertaken in order to calibrate it .",
    "but results coming from the analysis of solar type stars in open clusters are challenging the view of a smooth , decreasing trend modulating ca cycles .",
    "we do not question the main picture described above on ca decay , but it appears that this occurs mainly in one major event , in which it spans the vaughan ",
    "preston gap , and any evolution before and after such event is less important than the variation due to activity cycles .",
    "rotation is probably better correlated with stellar ages ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since it is not affected by any cyclic variation . however , rotation periods measurements are not possible for inactive stars , for which we can only have an estimation of the projected rotation velocity , which is not sufficient to to draw any firm conclusion on the nature of the angular momentum evolution .",
    "the matter deserves close attention , because chromospheric ages have been used in important studies on chemical enrichment and star formation in the galactic disk @xcite , and the age of stars hosting planetary systems @xcite .",
    "we should reach a definitive conclusion on whether ca is or not a good age indicator , and this can be better achieved by observing more solar  type stars in open clusters and by determining more precisely their ages .",
    "intense investigation has long been conducted on the topic , especially by using the large amount of data collected in mount wilson campaign @xcite and in the planet - search surveys @xcite .",
    "however , only the possibility of observing at high signal to noise and high resolution solar type stars in old and distant open clusters , provided by the 8 and 10m class telescopes , could make us progress in this field , and it is the key to address still unanswered questions .    in the present work ,",
    "i will report on the results that led us to reconsider the viability of ca as age indicator .",
    "it is also shown that data used to calibrate chromospheric ages do not contradict our conclusions .",
    "the complete sample on which our conclusions are based consists of 40 main  sequence stars in 7 open clusters and the sun .",
    "the nature of single , dwarf members of the parent clusters were established , for the 40 target stars , in published photometric , proper  motion and radial  velocity studies @xcite , and , only for ic  4756 and ngc  5822 , from our own radial  velocity measurements @xcite . the data about 15 stars in the hyades cluster consist of spectra taken with hires at keck , kindly made available to us by d. paulson , a. hatzes and p. cochran .",
    "the rest of the data consists of spectra taken with uves at vlt in two different runs . in the first ( eso run 66d-0457 , p.i .",
    "l. pasquini ) the targets were : 7 in praesepe , 2 in ngc  3680 , 5 in ic  4651 , and 6 in m  67 . in the second run ( eso run 73d-0655 , p.i .",
    "g. pace ) 2 stars were observed in ngc  5822 and 3 in ic  4756 .",
    "our uves spectra have a resolution of r@xmath1100000 in the spectral range from 4800 to 6800  , and r@xmath160000 in the spectral range 3200 to 4600  . after summing the spectra of the same star",
    ", we achieved s / n ratios per pixel ranging from about 50 to about 150 . due to the higher apparent brightness of its stars ,",
    "the quality of praesepe spectra is remarkably high .",
    "the hyades spectra we used have a resolution of r@xmath160000 and a signal  to  noise ratio per pixel ranging from 100 to 200 , and from 20 to 30 at the core of the ca ii k line .",
    "the procedure we adopted to measure chromospheric activity is described in detail elsewhere @xcite . here",
    "i present a complete summary .    as an indicator of chromospheric activity we used @xmath2 , i.e. the energy flux of the ca ii k  line emitted per unit surface in the chromosphere .",
    "we also computed the value normalised to bolometric emission :    @xmath3 .",
    "the spectra were normalised by dividing their intensity by the counts at the pseudo continuum point 3950.5 .",
    "the normalised flux was integrated over a 1 wide region centred on the ca ii k line .",
    "this region coincides with the chromospheric emission peak .",
    "the result of this integration is the 1  k  index and includes a contribution from the photosphere .",
    "the stars in ngc  3680 , ic  4651 , m  67 , ic  4756 and ngc  5822 showed the interstellar k absorption line which affected the chromospheric k  line feature .",
    "as for ngc  3680 , ic  4651 , and m  67 , we could evaluate the contribution of the interstellar absorption , by observing hot stars in each of these clusters , and correct for it .",
    "this was not possible , instead , for stars in ic  4756 and ngc  5822 . to measure the 1  k  index in these stars , we integrated the normalised flux only in the uncontaminated part of their profile .",
    "the praesepe stars are unaffected by interstellar absorption thus allowing us to calculate a ratio between the flux measured over the 1 and that measured over the portion of the feature which is unaffected by interstellar line in all stars .",
    "the initial measures for the affected stars were then multiplied by this factor to give a final corrected 1  k  index .",
    "the errors involved in the measurement of the 1  k  index were evaluated to be within 6% .    for the sun",
    ", we used the 1  k  index measurements made by @xcite .",
    "they monitored solar chromospheric activity from the first minimum to the maximum of the 21@xmath4 solar  activity cycle .",
    "subtraction of the photospheric contribution to the 1  k  index was made as follows .",
    "for the sun , we computed the photospheric correction using a solar  photosphere synthetic spectrum ( courtesy of p. bonifacio ) . for the other stars ,",
    "the photospheric contribution was computed by scaling the solar photospheric contribution by a factor that depends on the stellar parameters .",
    "these scaling factors were computed using the spectral synthesis code of moog @xcite , and kurucz s grid of models @xcite .",
    "stellar parameters , namely temperature , gravity , microturbulence and metallicity , were known from our chemical analyses in @xcite and , for hyades stars , from @xcite .    in order to transform the 1  k  index , which is an equivalent width , into an intrinsic flux , namely @xmath2 ,",
    "we multiplied the former by the flux at the stellar surface of the pseudo  continuum radiation at 3950.5 , which was obtained from the stellar temperatures using relationships published in @xcite ; and @xcite .    the employment of stellar temperatures from spectroscopic analysis of iron lines instead of published colours avoids the use of uncertain reddening estimations .    the results of the reviewed analysis of the old sample and of the analysis of the new sample , published in @xcite , were used to produce the diagram of ca as a function of temperature shown in figure [ fig ] .",
    "it was already pointed out back in the eighties that the distribution of ca is markedly bimodal @xcite .",
    "namely very few stars are less active than the hyades and significantly more active than the sun .",
    "this underpopulated range of values is usually referred to as vaughan  preston ( vp ) gap .",
    "@xcite explained it as a combined effect of ca saturation in active stars and a basal level in the ca indicator used by vp , due to the photospheric flux .",
    "these , it was claimed , enhance the impression of a gap .",
    "a variation in the local stellar birthrate was also invoked .",
    "other studies consider the vp gap a result of the nature of the ca evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our figure [ fig ] corroborates the latter hypothesis : all stars younger than 1.2 gyr , except one , lie above the gap , all stars older than 1.4 gyr with the exception of one , lie below it , indicating a drop of ca level in a very short time .",
    "the two exceptions are probably due to a particular phase of the activity cycle .",
    "it is worth noticing that the stars in either side of the gap differ not only in ca level , but also in its trend as a function of temperature : @xmath5 ( or equivalently @xmath6 ) depends weakly on the temperature for stars above the gap , while it has a distinct decreasing trend for stars below .",
    "this can be seen from our figure [ fig ] , and it appears clearer when a larger temperature range is considered , like , for instance , in @xcite ( @xcite , see figure 4 therein ) . furthermore , short ",
    "term temporal variations of ca are large and irregular for active stars and small and regular for inactive ones @xcite .",
    "there must be a major event at a given time of the stellar main sequence life time , that changes the way radiative heating mechanisms occur in the chromosphere , and , as a consequence , their dependence on stellar parameters as well as the shape and length of ca cycles .",
    "@xcite present theoretical calculations that reproduce the observed trend of ca with stellar temperature .",
    "they invoke two heating mechanisms : the magnetic  wave and the acoustic  wave heating .",
    "theoretical chromospheric fluxes for the former mechanism match the observed flux of the active stars , while theoretical fluxes for the latter mechanism match the observed flux of the inactive stars . in order to provide a physical explanation for the occurrence of the vp gap , @xcite proposed a transition from a complex to a simpler magnetic  field morphology which occurs at the time when the rotation decreases enough to reach a threshold value .",
    "more recently , @xcite detected two sequences in the period  versus  colour diagram of open clusters , and he associated them with two different rotation morphologies , intertwined with stellar magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite suggested a change of dynamo mechanism to explain the fact that stars occupy two very distinct sequences in a rotation period  versus  cycle period diagram .",
    "not all of these works can be used to explain our results .",
    "what is relevant for the present discussion is the possibility of a change in the nature of the dynamo mechanism taking place at a specific point of the main  sequence lifetime of solar  type stars .",
    "the most important conclusion of our analysis is that , before and after the fast drop of ca from above to below the vp gap in only 200 myr , its alleged smooth decay must be much less important than short term variations .",
    "we noted first in @xcite that ca in intermediate age clusters had already dropped to the solar level .",
    "after the reanalysis of the data using temperature determined spectroscopically from iron lines , 1 out of the 7 stars in the two intermediate age clusters ic  4651 and ngc  3680 turned out to lie in the vp gap .",
    "in addition , the membership of one of the two stars in ngc  3680 has been questioned @xcite . however , the data still point undoubtedly to a lack of evolution after 1.4 gyr , since 5 out of 6 secure intermediate age stars have ca levels equal or lower to those spanned by the sun and by m  67 stars ( empty dots in figure [ fig ] ) .",
    "this conclusion is also corroborated by the work of @xcite .",
    "the other part of the conclusions , that regarding the time interval between 0.7 and 1.2 gyr ( filled dots in figure [ fig ] ) , was achieved after the analysis of 5 stars in ngc  5822 and ic  4756 , together with the older data on hyades and praesepe @xcite .",
    "we could show that metallicity is unlikely to play a major role , since there is no significant difference between three almost coeval open clusters at different metallicities : praesepe , at [ fe / h]=0.27 @xcite , hyades , at [ fe / h]=0.13 @xcite , and ic  4756 at [ fe / h]=0.01 @xcite .",
    "the quoted iron abundance for praesepe is somewhat different from other published works ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , this result is based on the high  quality spectra described in section [ datasample ] , the iron abundance was obtained adopting both spectroscopic and photometric temperatures , several ways of normalizing for the continuum were tried , and even different people performed ew measurements in order to avoid personal bias , and in any case the result was [ fe / h ] significantly higher than 0.2 dex .",
    "our conclusions on ca evolution are still based on few stars per cluster , and they partly rely on the age scale of @xcite , which uses a calibration of a photospheric age indicator made on 11 clusters . in order to strengthen our results , or to disprove them ,",
    "we need more ca measurements in solar  type stars in open clusters based on high  resolution spectra and direct age determinations of the open clusters used based on improved colour  magnitude diagrams .",
    "we should both reobserve the already analysed stars , to obtain a time ",
    "averaged ca level , and choose other targets .",
    "the scenario suggested here contradicts the common belief that ca is well correlated with age , however our investigation does not include stars younger than the hyades , some of which are indeed more active than the hyades stars .",
    "in addition , the fact that young stars are active and old stars are not is not questioned here , and it causes a weak correlation between ca and age .",
    "we believe that data used in the literature to prove a deterministic relation between ca and age do not disprove our alternative view , and that more data are necessary to achieve a definitive conclusion .",
    "for instance @xcite used mount ",
    "wilson data about several solar  type stars in visual binaries and single f dwarfs , with ages from strmgren photometry in order to prove that the relationship between ca and age is , using their words , deterministic and not statistical .",
    "figure 3 in the aforementioned paper shows that @xmath6 and the logarithm of age are indeed correlated .",
    "however we notice , analysing data in table 1 and 2 therein , that among stars with @xmath7 , i.e. more active than the sun , the correlation between @xmath8 and age is not significant , the pearson correlation coefficient is about 0.1 . as for the other stars ,",
    "i.e. those with @xmath9 , the pearson coefficient is 0.35 , and its sign is positive , unlike what is expected according to an activity decay . in either group of stars",
    "there is , instead , a significant correlation between @xmath6 and the b - v colour , and it has opposite signs .",
    "another calibration of ca evolution with time is that of @xcite . from fig .",
    "4 therein , it can be seen that their result agrees with ours as far as inactive stars are concerned , i.e. ca does not evolve after it has crossed the vp gap .",
    "as far as active stars older than the hyades are concerned , there are 4 to 6 data  points ( for two stars it is not possible to say whether or not they are younger than the hyades and therefore out of the range considered in the present study ) . for this group ,",
    "the pearson coefficient indicates a level of anticorrelation between age and @xmath10 that is weak ( -0.27 ) or fair ( -0.57 ) , depending on how many stars we consider .    from @xcite",
    "it is clear that the one open cluster that supports a strict monotonicity of ca time evolution ( once short  time scale variations are smoothed out ) in the age range between that of the hyades and that of m  67 and the sun , is ngc  752 .",
    "this cluster , according to @xcite , is older than ngc  5822 and younger than ngc  3680 , i.e. exactly in the range in which we expect the transition to occur .",
    "however , @xcite also show that companions of a binary system tend to have similar ca level , especially if they have similar colours .",
    "according to the assumption that ca is a good age indicator , this circumstance is easily interpreted as due to the fact that companions of a binary system are coeval .",
    "we suggest that it could be instead related to the nature of the binary systems .",
    "we conclude that data in @xcite are compatible with the conclusion that , within the age range from 0.7 to 1.2 gyr and from 1.4 gyr to solar age , any age ",
    "activity relationship must be weaker than the short term variations    i thank the reviewers for useful comments and the organization of the helas ",
