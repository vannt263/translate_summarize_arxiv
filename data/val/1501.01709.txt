    "the evolution of star clusters is driven by internal ( e.g. two - body relaxationi , mass loss by stellar evolution ) , as well as external processes ( e.g. tidal forces of a galaxy ) ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* spitzer 1987 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* elson et al . 1987 ) ) . since these mechanisms finally lead to the dissolution of clusters they have a finite life time .",
    "so , if our sun has been born in an open star cluster , the solar planetary system may also have formed before the dissolution of its parent star cluster .    observations of exoplanets have been possible since the early 1990s . as of december 2014",
    ", more than 1,800 exoplanets have been discovered , among which are 473 multi - planet systems like our own solar system ( http://exoplanet.eu ) .",
    "nevertheless , most exoplanets are found in the solar neighborhood ; very few exoplanets ( e.g. kepler-66 , kepler-67 ) are found in star clusters .",
    "star clusters , especially cores of globular clusters , are characterized by high density of stars and high velocity dispersions , which results in frequent close encounters .",
    "current observations suggest that formation of planetary systems in dense regions of star clusters .",
    "this could be due to instability against external gravitational perturbations , though there may also be some instrumental biases due to detection limits .",
    "previous studies include direct @xmath0-body simulation ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* spurzem et al . 2009 ) ) and monte - carlo simulations ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hao et al . 2013 ) ) .",
    "we present numerical simulations to investigate the dynamical stability of planetary systems in star clusters .",
    "coupling planetary system with star cluster dynamics is a multi - scale problem , due to time scales ranging from @xmath1 for planetary orbits to @xmath2 years for stars orbiting in the cluster .",
    "full direct coupled simulations are expensive , though not impossible ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* spurzem et al . 2009 ) ) ; but frequently monte carlo approaches are used ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hao et al . 2013 ) ) .",

    "we integrate star cluster dynamics directly with nbody6++ ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "we distribute 50 ( 100 ) planetary systems randomly across the @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) cluster , to sample different positions and environments of planetary systems in star clusters .",
