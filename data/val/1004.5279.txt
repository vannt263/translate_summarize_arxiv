    "the appealing physical concept of converting energy from randomly moving brownian particles in asymmetric set - ups into a directed particle flow , possibly against an external load , has led to an enormous amount of works establishing an own field at the interface of transport and nonequilibrium statistical physics .",
    "peter hnggi , as one of the founders of this branch of statistical physics , coined the term `` brownian motors '' for such systems @xcite",
    ". ratchets , spatially periodic structures with broken left - right symmetry operating far from equilibrium and thereby generating directed particle motion in the presence of unbiased time - periodic driving constitute one important class of such systems .",
    "the ratchet mechanism was first discovered for classical brownian particles @xcite and then generalized to quantum dissipative systems  @xcite .",
    "later this concept has been extended to the coherent regime where corresponding ratchets and rectifiers have gained increasing attention , in particular after the experimental demonstration of ratchet - induced charge flow in periodically arranged lateral quantum dots based on a two - dimensional semiconductor heterostructure @xcite .",
    "coherent rectifiers are characterized by phase - coherent quantum dynamics in the central periodic system in between leads where dissipation takes place .",
    "for a recent comprehensive review of the whole , broad field of ratchets and artificial brownian motors see @xcite .",
    "while nearly all the works in this field have addressed the problem to achieve unbiased directed _ particle _ transport , we have generalized this concept to the notion of _ spin _ ratchets , corresponding set - ups which allow for generating spin currents , partly even in the absence of charge currents . in this respect ,",
    "`` zeeman ratchets '' that are based on an asymmetric , spatially periodic magnetic field are closest to the usual charge ratchets : owing to the zeeman term in the hamiltonian , spin - up and -down electrons experience opposite asymmetric periodic potentials , which should give rise to a net flow of charge carriers with different spin polarization in opposite directions , corresponding to a pure spin current @xcite .",
    "similar results have been found for a one - dimensional quantum wire with strong repulsive electron interactions @xcite .",
    "however , contrary to particle ratchets with preserved particle number , spin - polarization is a volatile property and subject to spin relaxation .",
    "hence in @xcite we showed , both conceptually and numerically for a realistic model of a zeeman ratchet including spin - flip processes that pure spin current generation in coherent mesoscopic conductors is indeed possible . in parallel",
    "we devised the concept of a `` spin - orbit ratchet '' @xcite , a setting where the spin orbit interaction ( soi ) in a quantum wire is employed to generate a spin current .",
    "contrary to particle ratchets , which rely on asymmetries in either the spatially periodic modulation or the time - periodic driving , a spin - orbit ( so ) based ratchet works even for symmetric electrostatic periodic potentials , due to the spin - inversion asymmetry of the soi . as a result",
    ", no ratchet charge current is produced in parallel , leading to a pure ratchet spin current @xcite . as possible realizations we have in mind systems based on semiconductor heterostructures with rashba soi  @xcite that can be tuned in strength by an external gate voltage allowing to control the spin evolution .",
    "such a so - based ratchet is an example of a device for `` mesmerizing '' semiconductors @xcite , i.e.  for magnetizing semiconductors without using magnets , in contrast to the usual method of spin injection through ferromagnets .",
    "also in this sense spin ratchets have much in common with spin pumping _",
    "i.e. _  the generation of spin - polarized currents at zero bias via cyclic parameter variation . different theoretical proposals based on so  @xcite and zeeman  @xcite mediated adiabatic spin pumping in non - magnetic semiconductors have been suggested and , in the latter case , experimentally observed in mesoscopic cavities  @xcite .",
    "adiabatically driven spin ratchets , however , also differ from adiabatic spin pumps , since ratchets operate with a single ac driving parameter in the nonlinear bias regime , while the usual proposals for adiabatic pumping include a cyclic variation of at least two parameters at zero external bias @xcite .",
    "recently , the concept of so - based spin ratchets has been generalized to the quantum dissipative regime . to this",
    "end the above setting was extended by coupling the orbital degrees of freedom additionally to an external bath ( within a caldeira - leggett model @xcite ) representing , e.g. effects of phonons .",
    "while so - mediated spin - phonon coupling usually leads to spin relaxation , it could be shown that for this ratchet set - up the opposite is true : a finite , pure spin current is generated @xcite .",
    "this is remarkable as it means that thermal energy from the bath is converted , via the so coupling , into a directed spin current with aligned charge carrier spins ; in this sense such a dissipative spin ratchet can be viewed as a `` brownian spin motor '' .",
    "an extension to an additional in - plane magnetic field which allows for further controlling the spin current can be found in @xcite .",
    "the study of dissipative so ratchets took another twist when it turned out that a finite _ charge _ current arises in a so ratchet even if both the spatially periodic potential and the time - periodic driving are symmetric @xcite .",
    "while directed transport is well known to appear for symmetric potentials as long as the driving contains a time asymmetry @xcite , it seems paradoxical that one can even go without this symmetry breaking . the charge ratchet mechanism for this space- and time - symmetric case results from the interplay between quantum dissipation and so - induced spin - flip processes and thereby from a hidden symmetry breaking through the so coupling .",
    "this new class of space- and time - symmetric charge ratchets is hence built on the intrinsic spin nature of the particles to be transported , exhibiting certain conceptual similarities with the classical `` intrinsic ratchets '' discussed in @xcite .    in the present paper we however focus on coherent so ratchets and extend the minimum model introduced in @xcite in several directions in order to gain an improved and systematic understanding of the spin ratchet mechanism and its limits for set - ups describing realistic mesoscopic devices .    first , most investigations of ratchets disregard interaction effects and usually model the time - periodic driving in terms of the bare homogeneous external field .",
    "however , in particular for charge ratchets in the nonlinear bias regime , the actual voltage drop across the system may deviate from simple bias models often used , e.g.  from a linear model , and hence can affect the ratchet current which is known to depend sensitively on the details of the system .",
    "here we will consider in a self - consistent treatment the charge redistribution in the ratchet due to the external bias giving rise to a nonlinear voltage drop and thereby presumably altering the resulting spin - dependent transmission through the device .",
    "our study includes , second , an analysis of disorder effects usually unavoidable in mesoscopic devices .",
    "it is well known that impurity scattering in a so medium usually leads to dyakonov - perel - type spin relaxation @xcite .",
    "this mechanism will obviously counteract the generation of spin - polarized currents , and hence it is important to understand to which extend the spin ratchet mechanism is robust against disorder effects .",
    "third , as shown in @xcite , at least two so - coupled transverse modes in a quasi - one - dimensional wire with at least one electrostatic potential barrier are required for generating a net spin current .",
    "while an increase in the barrier number on the whole leads to an enhanced ratchet spin current @xcite , the spin current dependence on the number @xmath0 of transverse modes , respectively the wire width , remains to be investigated .",
    "our analysis shows that , on average , the ratchet spin current does only marginally increase with @xmath0 .",
    "however , interestingly , we find for a given ( dc ) bias a linear increase of the spin - polarized transmission with @xmath0 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after introducing the system and the numerical method in sec .  2 below , in sec .  3 we will first consider spin - polarization effects in dc - transport through two - dimensional ribbons with rashba soi and outline an important underlying polarization mechanism . in sec .",
    "4 we then study the so ratchet response for the nonequilibrium and disordered case and conclude with a number of remarks in sec .",
    "we consider a quantum wire ( oriented in @xmath1-direction ) which can be regarded as being realized in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in the @xmath2-plane . a typical structure is visualized in fig .",

    "so far we have studied the case of disorder free , clean conductors . however , in realistic experimental samples dopands , crystal defects and impurities give rise to momentum scattering .",
    "this in turn can cause spin relaxation  @xcite , which might limit the performance of the spin ratchet . in order to investigate the role of impurity scattering on the ratchet effect we again consider the device shown in fig .",

    "[ sorat]d . for the sake of computational feasibility in the following",
    "we assume a linear voltage drop in the central region , since we have seen that such a model represents a fair approximation for the actual voltage drop for a wide parameter range , and for the sake of computational feasibility .",
    "for a fixed bias @xmath90 , it is given by @xmath156 in fig .",
    "[ sorat:10b ] we present the spin ratchet conductance @xmath157 as a function of the scaled driving amplitude @xmath158 for three representative fermi energies . in view of eq .",
    "( [ lzrock ] ) , we expect the spin ratchet mechanism to be enhanced for higher driving amplitudes @xmath158 , since the difference between @xmath159 and @xmath160 depends on the slope of the voltage drop . indeed , in fig .",
    "[ sorat:10b ] we find a linear increase of the spin ratchet conductance for small @xmath158 , which can be understood by expanding eq .",

    "results are shown for a clean system ( solid lines ) and for systems with anderson disorder of strength @xmath164 ( dashed lines ) and @xmath165 ( dotted lines ) .",
    "parameters : @xmath35 , @xmath34 , @xmath166 , @xmath155 , @xmath167 .",
    "[ sorat:10b ] ]    we model impurity scattering by introducing anderson disorder in the tight - binding version of the hamiltonian  ( [ hsim ] ) . to this end",
    "we add a random potential from the box distribution @xmath168 $ ] to the on - site energy of each site in the central region of the wire . in fig .",
    "[ sorat:10b ] we compare the case of the clean quantum wire ( solid lines ) with results for the spin ratchet conductance for a disordered quantum wire ( dashed and dotted lines ) .",
    "although @xmath144 is reduced compared to the disorder - free system , the surviving spin ratchet conductance still possesses a reasonable magnitude . +",
    "in order to get an idea of the corresponding mean free path in those calculations , we now exemplary set the lattice spacing to @xmath169 nm and choose inas with @xmath170 as the 2deg material .",
    "then the width of the ratchet device is @xmath171 , the length of a single barrier is @xmath172 and hence the overall length of the ratchet set - up is of order 1 micron .",
    "the rashba so strength is @xmath173 , a value well in reach of present day experiments  @xcite . the mean free path in this system",
    "can then be approximated as @xmath174  @xcite . then the disorder strengths chosen in fig .",
    "[ sorat:10b ] , @xmath175 and @xmath176 , correspond to an elastic mean free path of the order of one and two microns , respectively , for all fermi energies considered .",
    "we hence can conclude from fig .",
    "[ sorat:10b ] that the spin ratchet effect prevails if @xmath177 is of the order of or larger than the ratchet system size , i.e.  even in the disordered but non - diffusive limit . since mean free paths @xmath178 m are possible in clean inas quantum wells  @xcite , in realistic experimental situations spin ratchet output signals of reasonable magnitude should be observable .",
    "in this paper , one the one hand , we have considered the spin - dependent transmission through single and multiple barriers in stripes build from two - dimensional electron gases with rashba so interaction .",
    "we have shown that for coherent transport across a smooth barrier with so - mixed transverse channels , the spin transmission , i.e.  difference between transmitted particles of opposite spin direction , increases linearly with channel number @xmath0 .",
    "this implies an in - plane polarization of transmitted charge carriers , which is independent of @xmath0 or the wire width , respectively , and thereby distinctly larger than usual mesoscopic spin transmissions , such as e.g.  from conductance fluctuations @xcite or in the context of the mesoscopic spin hall effect @xcite which are typically of order 1 .    on the other hand ,",
    "we have addressed the so - mediated spin ratchet mechanism and thereby extended previous work , which gave a proof of principle for so ratchets @xcite , to realistic mesoscopic systems by accounting for certain nonequilibrium and disorder effects . in particular , we presented a self - consistent treatment of the ratchet transport in the strongly nonlinear , though coherent regime , showing that linear voltage - drop models often represent good approximations to the real charge rearrangement but may break down in parameter regimes dominated by resonant charge and spin transfer .",
    "we further investigated the effects of elastic impurity scattering due to static disorder .",
    "we found that , as expected , the ratchet spin current decreases with increasing scattering rate , but a finite fraction of the clean spin current prevails ( with the same sign ) if the elastic mean free path is of the order of or larger than the system size .",
    "we close with a few further remarks : for systems with bulk inversion asymmetry , such as gaas , dresselhaus so interaction @xcite has additionally to be considered .",
    "calculations  @xcite for",
    "a ballistic so ratchet with combined rashba- and dresselaus so coupling showed that the overall picture is not altered and furthermore demonstrate that the ratchet spin current direction can be changed upon tuning the relative strength of the two so coupling mechanisms . in particular",
    "one finds spin current reversals for equal rashba- and dresselaus so interaction where the so effects cancel .",
    "this feature allows for inverting the polarization direction of the output current by simple electrical means , namely by tuning the rashba so strength , e.g.  through a gate voltage .",
    "by now we have reached a fairly complete picture of the so - based spin ratchet mechanism in both limits , the quantum coherent and the strongly dissipative regime . a further extension of previous work and a future challenge would consist in bridging these two separate limits treated up to now .    in the coherent regime we so far considered the case of adiabatic driving that is relevant , e.g. , for ratchet experiments employing nanostructures with an external ac bias voltage .",
    "if the system is driven through external radiation , the timescales for driving and for electron or spin dynamics can be comparable , which may give rise to further interesting spin ratchet phenomena .",
    "this ac regime requires an approach beyond the adiabatic limit , e.g.  a floquet treatment .",
    "the concept to extend the particle ratchet mechanism to other quantities such as the spin degree of freedom may be further generalized . along",
    "this line one may think of extending this concept to other spin 1/2-type quantities , for instance the pseudo- or valley - spin degree of freedoms of charge carriers in graphene .",
    "more generally one may think of devising ratchet mechanisms to spatially separate objects according to their further internal degrees of freedom , for instance atoms with internal two- or multi - level dynamics .",
