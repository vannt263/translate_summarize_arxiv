    "at the lhc , the work of many experimental collaborations that have been dedicated their efforts to the search for the higgs boson was succeeded  @xcite .",
    "this particle represents the first evidence of detection of a spin-0 particle , which in principle seems to be the higgs boson of the sm . in this direction",
    ", one could think that in the fundamental theory ( at high energies ) , there may exist couplings between new scalar particles with all the particles detected .",
    "in addition , since the lhc is the first machine that operates at the scale of tevs , it is hoped to have good possibilities for detection of new particles at this energy scale .",
    "therefore , it is expected that in the following years the lhc can offer different possibilities of detection of this type of particles or discard their existence at the scale of tevs .",
    "at least , the scenario is optimistic since the experimental collaborations atlas and cms have been able to construct a reliable detection machinery referring to spin-0 resonances .",
    "indeed , atlas and cms collaborations have continued searching for new exotic particles , such as the randall - sundrum spin-2 boson  @xcite or new heavy scalar particles  @xcite .",
    "thus , the possibility to search for new physics phenomena at this energy scale is higher than past years with the upgrade of the cms and atlas detectors  @xcite .",
    "abreast , in the literature there are theoretical proposals for the search of new heavy scalar particles  @xcite . in more recent works , with the aim of the explaining a possible resonance around 750 gev in the diphoton channel , which was misunderstood due to statistical fluctuation",
    ", a lot of phenomenological studies were done  @xcite .",
    "several extensions of the standard model ( sm ) predict the existence of new particles with masses of the order of tevs  @xcite .",
    "the exhaustive search for new scalar particles at the lhc give us the possibility to explore new physics processes related to extended higgs sectors . in this sense",
    ", there are many alternative formulations that predict more content of scalar particles such as the two - higgs doublet models ( 2hdms )  @xcite , three - higgs doublet model ( 3hdm )  @xcite , higgs - singlet extension model  @xcite , little higgs models ( lhms )  @xcite , etc . among the wide variety of lhms ,",
    "the case of the littlest higgs model ( lthm ) is of peculiar interest since there is no new degrees of freedom beyond the sm under tev scale together with its reduced spectrum of new scalar particles  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this type of models offer a possible solution to hierarchy problem , which takes place when the higgs boson mass is affected by corrections at one - loop level .",
    "the lhms also arise as an alternative for the study of the electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite , on the basis of dimensional deconstruction  @xcite , with feature of canceling quadratic divergences .",
    "in fact , the quadratic divergence generated at the one - loop level through the sm gauge bosons is canceled via the quadratic divergence introduced by the new heavy gauge bosons at the same perturbative level . the one - loop quadratic divergence induced in the sm yukawa sector",
    "is removed by introducing new heavy fermions such that it cancels the quadratic divergence coming from the top quark . in lhms ,",
    "the new higgs field acquire mass becoming pseudo - goldstone bosons in accordance with the breaking of a global symmetry at the energy scale of tevs , where a massless higgs appears .",
    "the quadratic - divergent corrections to the higgs mass arise at loop level , therefore , this warrants a light higgs . with regard to lthm  @xcite , the new states arising at the tev energy scale form a new set of four gauge bosons with the same quantum numbers as the sm gauge bosons , namely , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , an exotic quark with the same charge as the sm top quark , and a new heavy scalar triplet , which contains six physical states : double - charged scalars @xmath11 , single - charged scalars @xmath12 , a neutral scalar @xmath13 , and a neutral pseudo scalar @xmath14 .",

    "the @xmath15 decays were proposed to explore the current parameter space of the lthm model ; it has given special emphasis to the decay of the @xmath13 scalar boson into two @xmath21 bosons justified by the emergence of the recent experimental results previously discussed .",
    "although the parameter space of the lthm has been severely constrained , yet there is room to explore the @xmath13 decay into two @xmath21 bosons as a function of the energy scale @xmath18 .",
    "we have studied physical regions accordingly to the experimental bounds and phenomenological results ; in specific , we have proposed the following range of study for the @xmath18 parameter : 2 tev@xmath1864 tev .",
    "thus , we find out that the @xmath13 mass is between 1.66 tev and 3.32 tev and the branching ratio for the @xmath3 decay is of the order of @xmath4 on this energy interval . regarding to the @xmath151 and @xmath150 processes , their branching ratios at best take values of @xmath185 and @xmath204 , respectively .",
    "we also simulate the production cross section of the heavy scalar particle in proton - proton collision at @xmath205 tev , being found that for @xmath170 tev could be estimated around one ten of events for the @xmath3 decay at lhc in the best case and in ideal conditions .",
