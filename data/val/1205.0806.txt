    "observations of extrasolar planetary systems in the post - main sequence have implications for the survival of earth and the terrestrial planets , and indirectly measure the robustness of planet formation processes .",
    "precision radial velocity surveys are discovering a growing number of giant exoplanets orbiting post - main sequence stars , where the hosts are either subgiant @xcite or first ascent giant stars @xcite .",
    "these systems have undergone relatively mild evolution compared to later stages , and their planet properties may only reflect formation processes @xcite",
    ". however , it appears the effect of star - planet tides with increasing stellar radius is non - negligible at this early stage @xcite , and eventually becomes crucial @xcite .",
    "candidate planets orbiting post - red giant branch stars are observed with varying degrees of observational evidence @xcite , but these few detections currently lack the benefit of independent confirmation ( e.g. , transits ) and statistics that have corroborated the conventional exoplanet population .",
    "planets orbiting these more highly evolved stars and stellar remnants provide tests of primordial planet formation , long - term star - planet and planet - disk evolution , and second - generation planet formation @xcite .",
    "the latter scenario is the only viable mechanism to produce the pulsar planets @xcite , and they remain the only post - main sequence planets confirmed by independent means ( gravitational perturbations ; @xcite ) .    planetary systems around white dwarfs offer a glimpse into possible futures of the solar system @xcite and the opportunity to study the composition of planetary solids @xcite . furthermore , and perhaps surprisingly , because white dwarfs outnumber a and f - type stars in the solar neighborhood , they may represent the majority of the nearest planetary systems formed at intermediate - mass stars ( ! ) .",
    "while there have been several ground- and space - based searches for giant planets around white dwarfs @xcite , to date the only published candidate comes from variations in pulsation timing of gd66 @xcite .",
    "this paper describes interferometric and astrometric constraints on stellar and low - mass companions to gd66 ( wd0517@xmath0307 ) .",
    "the motivation for the study is described in  2 , where the observational data supporting a companion are reviewed , and theoretical considerations for planet survival are explored .",
    "the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ fine guidance sensor ( fgs ) and u.s .",
    "naval observatory ( usno ) observations are described in  3 , and companion mass limits are derived from the analysis of these data combined with prior studies .",
    "there are two lines of reasoning that led to a search for stellar - mass companions around gd66 , and each are discussed in turn below .",
    "the first is the continued , increasing trend in the observed pulsation arrival times , and the second is the issue of planet survival within a few au during the post - main sequence evolutionary phases of an intermediate - mass stellar host .",
    "@xcite performed photometric monitoring of 15 zzceti stars over the course of four years and identified a low - amplitude , sinusoidal variation in the expected arrival times of pulsations in gd66 . a single turnover in the observed minus calculated ( or @xmath1 ) diagram was observed around epoch 2005.3 . assuming the pulsation frequency is perfectly stable , and that deviations in transit time are caused by orbital motion , the magnitude of this variation is given by    @xmath2    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the mass of the star and companion respectively",
    ", @xmath5 is the semimajor axis , and @xmath6 is the orbital inclination .",
    "this can be rewritten as function of the orbital period @xmath7 using kepler s third law .",
    "@xmath8    thus , for a given periodicity in the pulsation arrival times , the amplitude is a linear function of companion mass for @xmath9 .",
    "a sinusoidal fit to the gd66 timing data was found with parameters @xmath10s , @xmath11yr @xcite , thus implying @xmath12au and @xmath13 for @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this solution predicted a turnover in the @xmath1 diagram in late 2007 that did not occur .",
    "rather , @xcite later reported that the arrival times continued to increase and a revised fit yielded @xmath15s , @xmath16yr , and hence @xmath17au , @xmath18 .",
    "this newer fit predicted a turnover in 2008 that again did not occur @xcite .",
    "based on this trend of increasing @xmath19 , it became possible that the observed signal could be due to a stellar companion . in this case , the initial turnover discovered in the @xmath1 diagram would be a relatively low probability event .",
    "despite being somewhat unlikely , this alternative merits investigation due to the profound implications of a planet orbiting a stellar remnant .",
    "stellar mass solutions to equation [ eqn2 ] become plausible for @xmath20s and @xmath21 , but existing infrared data ( see  3.3 ) constrain such companions to be degenerate : brown dwarf , white dwarf , or neutron star .",
    "notably , a second white dwarf can remain hidden in optical spectroscopy if at least of comparable mass to the primary .",
    "an excellent example of this is pg0901@xmath0140 @xcite , a @xmath22 da5@xmath23da6 binary that exhibits an apparently - single da5.5 spectrum @xcite .",
    "for such a companion mass to be viable , the increasing @xmath1 trend observed by @xcite would have to continue for several years .",
    "interestingly , orbital separations of a few to several au have been found for five double white dwarf systems using _ hst _ fgs observations @xcite , lending credibility to a binary scenario .",
    ".usno observations of gd66 over 10.25yr [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     _ note_. photometry is on the johnson - cousins system and given in vega magnitudes .",
    "conservative errors for these mean magnitudes are 0.02mag .",
    "because gd66 is a carbon - oxygen core white dwarf , it has passed through both the first ascent ( rgb ) and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phases .",
    "@xcite give spectroscopically derived stellar parameters for gd66 of @xmath24k , @xmath25 , implying @xmath26 . using the average of three different initial - to - final mass relations",
    "@xcite yields a possible range of main - sequence progenitor masses between 2.2 and @xmath27 . as a basic line of reasoning that favors a stellar companion over a planet at a few au ,",
    "consider that the maximum agb radius for this range of progenitor stars is in the vicinity of 3au @xcite .",
    "however , as explored in detail by @xcite there are at least three processes that determine the orbital fate of low - mass companions to post - main sequence stars such as white dwarfs : 1 ) orbital expansion due to mass loss @xcite , 2 ) tidal dissipation of orbital energy , and 3 ) destruction or survival in a common envelope phase .",
    "it is well known that very low - mass stellar and brown dwarf companions are capable of surviving within a common envelope @xcite that results from unstable mass transfer from a giant primary @xcite , and these short - period systems are manifest among white dwarf binaries @xcite .",
    "the inward pull of tidal torques and common envelope evolution , together with the outward expansion of orbits beyond the grasp of frictional and tidal forces , effectively create a depopulated region of intermediate orbital separations @xcite . this bimodal distribution of low - mass , unevolved companions to white dwarfs , barren from @xmath28 to @xmath29au , has been empirically confirmed using high - resolution optical imaging with _ hst _ @xcite and by spectroscopic and photometric monitoring from the ground @xcite .    following the prescription of @xcite ,",
    "the relevant semimajor axis boundaries for single planets at gd66 were computed including mass loss , tidal forces , and common envelope evolution .",
    "the main - sequence progenitor masses span the range of values expected for this system ( see  3.1 ) , while companion masses include the @xmath30 determined from the pulsation timing analysis , and a 7@xmath31 upper limit estimated from infrared photometry and modeling ( see  3.3 ; @xcite ) .",
    "included in these calculations are the largest , initial semimajor axis for planets directly engulfed by the agb star , and smallest , final semimajor axis for planets that avoid being swallowed .",
    "planets are destroyed in the first instance , while in the latter case their orbits are strongly influenced by tides yet just avoid the giant envelope .",
    "it is found that for a wide range of possible tidal prescriptions , all companions that avoid engulfment end up in @xmath32au orbits , and all but the most finely tuned initial conditions lead to final separations several au larger . therefore , an extant planet at @xmath33au around a white dwarf remnant of a @xmath34 main - sequence star would require an unexpected evolutionary scenario ( e.g. , capture or re - formation ) .",
    "these predictions imply that a planet is rather unlikely , and largely prompted a search for stellar - mass objects capable of producing the sinusoidal timing variations observed by @xcite .    ,",
    "optical ccd observations of gd66 spanning just over a decade were carried out as part of the usno faint star parallax program .",
    "imaging photometry was collected for the purposes of correcting for differential color refraction and to measure an absolute trigonometric parallax . in practice , because observations were taken within ( and usually much less than ) one hour of meridian , differential color refraction was minimal .",
    "a complete discussion of the astrometric data acquisition and reduction can be found in @xcite .",
    "briefly , the observations were taken using the usno 1.55 m strand astrometric reflector and tektronix @xmath35 camera with 24.0@xmath36 m pixels at @xmath37pixel@xmath38 .",
    "these observations employed a wide @xmath39-band filter , similar to that described in @xcite .",
    "independent photometry in the johnson @xmath40 and cousins @xmath41 band was collected on two nights at the usno 40 in telescope .",
    "photometric standards of various colors from @xcite were taken at multiple airmasses to correct for extinction and color terms .     and a @xmath42 threshold of 3mas deviation due to circular orbital motion for gd66 .",
    "plotted as dotted lines are the astrometric excursion as a function of companion mass for several benchmark orbital periods .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to a detectable companion mass of 50@xmath43 at nearly all orbital periods between 4 and 20yr . for circular motion ,",
    "the companion mass sensitivity is immune to orbital inclination , and thus the usno astrometry rule out a wide range of low - mass , stellar and substellar companions capable of producing the @xmath1 variations .",
    "[ fig2],width=325 ]        the usno astrometric results are listed in table [ tbl1 ] , placing gd66 at @xmath44pc , and yielding an absolute visual magnitude of @xmath45mag . comparing this with the spectroscopically derived value of @xmath46mag based on @xmath47k @xcite ,",
    "the parallax favors a slightly higher mass . using this same effective temperature , white dwarf atmospheric models yield @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and a cooling age of 420myr @xcite .",
    "although the astrometric data presented here do not constrain the temperature of gd66 , the the zzceti instability strip is narrow at @xmath50k for @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "to within the errors introduced by its few % photometric variability @xcite , the optical @xmath52 photometry of gd66 yields colors precisely as expected for a da white dwarf of the published effective temperature .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] plots the astrometric residuals for each observing season after subtracting the proper motion and parallax , demonstrating a few mas precision .",
    "this relative astrometry is sensitive to orbital motion induced by an _ optically - dark _ companion . notwithstanding the systematically noisier residuals in declination relative to those in right ascension ,",
    "the astrometric monitoring of gd66 should have detected a @xmath42 deviation of 3mas due to orbital motion in the plane of the sky .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] marks this detection threshold in a plot of the astrometric excursion as a function of companion mass , for several benchmark orbital periods in a circular binary configuration .",
    "these mass limits are independent of orbital inclination for circular orbits , and degrade only in the specific case of an eccentric orbit at high inclination with line of apsides near to the line of sight ( @xmath53 ) .    because the astrometric companion sensitivity only diminishes for finely - tuned orbital parameters , the usno data rule out all @xmath54 ( 0.05@xmath55 ) , optically - faint companions , including very low - mass stars , neutron stars and black holes , for orbital periods @xmath56yr .",
    "remarkably , a period - dependent range of relatively low , brown dwarf companion masses can be similarly ruled out for longer periods up to 20yr .",
    "however , these data provide little or no constraints on white dwarf companions in this mass range , as a binary of equal mass and brightness will exhibit no photocenter shift .",
    "gd66 was observed during",
    "cycle 18 on 6 october 2010 by fgs1r in its high angular resolution transfer mode , using the f538w filter which covers @xmath57 . in this mode",
    "fgs1r repeatedly scans an object and provides data from which interference fringes along its two orthogonal axes can be reconstructed @xcite .",
    "a relatively bright comparison star known to be a point source at fgs resolution , bd@xmath5812 was observed as a calibration source .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] plots the fgs data for gd66 and calibration star , and reveals the white dwarf is unresolved to 10mas and @xmath59mag .",
    "the fgs interferometry is sensitive to white dwarf companions at nearly all possible orbital separations and inclinations . while two equal mass degenerates would be readily detected down to 0.56au and @xmath60yr , such short periods are not consistent with the @xmath56yr , pulsation timing variations of gd66 . for the periods fitted to the timing data of gd66 , equation [ eqn1 ]",
    "dictates that a stellar - mass companion should be within several degrees of face - on .",
    "therefore , the fgs data would have readily detected orbital separations from a few to several tens of au , and thus rule out companions of comparable brightness and mass . however , in the very low probability event that the @xmath1 turnover was a 1 in @xmath61 chance detection , the fgs data also constrain a putative double degenerate binary for any inclination . if the observed @xmath1 minimum in 2005.3 corresponds to a binary system in conjunction as seen from earth ,",
    "then the projected separation of the stars has been widening since , yet must still have an angular separation below 10mas @xmath62au from its non-@xmath63resolution by fgs in 2010.8 .",
    "this implies a system period greater than @xmath64yr for edge - on orbits and total system masses @xmath65 .",
    "all double white dwarfs with shorter periods would have had a wider projected separation and been detected by the fgs .",
    "importantly , white dwarf secondaries fainter than the primary by @xmath66mag are not feasible by normal , unperturbed stellar evolution ; the total system age is insufficient to achieve such low luminosities . from the 0.66@xmath67 white dwarf mass derived from the trigonometric parallax , the main - sequence progenitor of gd66 had a mass between 2.4 and 2.8@xmath68 @xcite , a hydrogen - burning lifetime in the range @xmath69myr @xcite , and a total system age of @xmath70gyr . any cool and massive white dwarf ( total age @xmath71 cooling age ) can become no fainter than @xmath72mag over 1.1gyr @xcite and would be detectable as @xmath73mag .",
    "existing _ spitzer _ irac photometry of gd66 are sensitive to substellar companions that would not be detected by the usno or fgs optical astrometry .",
    "@xcite used these infrared observations to estimate an upper limit on spatially - unresolved ( within @xmath74au ) , self - luminous objects of 7@xmath31 , thus indicating the putative companion should have a planet - sized mass .",
    "their method utilized observations of three white dwarfs with similar temperatures to constrain the photospheric flux ratio between 3.6 and 4.5@xmath36 m , reporting a @xmath75 total uncertainty of 0.6% in the ratio observed for gd66 . as an example of an alternative method using irac photometry , @xcite",
    "establish substellar companion mass limits at 15% above the predicted ( or measured ) 4.5@xmath36 m photospheric flux . applying this procedure to gd66 with the usno parallax distance , a total system age of 1gyr ( see  3.2 ) , and assuming its 4.5@xmath36 m flux measurement @xcite is due to the photosphere",
    ", one obtains an upper limit of 11@xmath31 @xcite .",
    "if one insists on only a 10% excess at this wavelength , the upper limit drops to and 9@xmath31 .",
    "it should be mentioned that all such analyses depend on atmospheric models , none of which have empirical constraints at these masses , as well as the adopted total system age .",
    "regardless of the method , the infrared data rule out all but planetary masses , according to models .",
    "the combined observational data on gd66 limit any binary companions orbiting within several au to planetary masses . specifically ,",
    "any long - term , increasing trend in the pulsation arrival times can not be due to stellar - mass secondaries , which include low - mass stars , white dwarfs , neutron stars , and black holes with periods longer than 4yr .",
    "the usno relative astrometric monitoring of just over a decade rules out stellar - mass , dark companions with periods between 4 and 20yr , while the fgs observations rule out virtually all white dwarf companions , regardless of orbital inclination . based on substellar cooling models ,",
    "infrared data further restrict low - mass companions within a hundred au to have planetary masses .",
    "it is noteworthy that the trigonometric parallax and infrared photometry by themselves rule out a range of double degenerate scenarios , but the astrometric monitoring and interferometry provide significantly more stringent limits to such binaries .",
    "if the observed timing data at gd66 are due to orbital motion , these new and exiting data rule out a vast range of realistic companion masses , and strengthen the likelihood of a planet - sized mass as the cause . because stellar evolution models and resulting star - planet interactions indicate a planet within a few au of an intermediate - mass star is not likely to survive to the white dwarf stage , the putative planets at gd66 and other post - rgb stars v391peg and kpd1943 + 1405 ( koi55 ) , if real , may have been dynamically injected or formed in a second - generation of planet formation .",
    "further study of these and future , post - rgb planet candidates is needed to better understand the population and architecture of planetary systems around white dwarfs .",
