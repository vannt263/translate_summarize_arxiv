    "quantum information and quantum computation can process multiple tasks which are intractable with classical technologies .",
    "quantum entanglement is no doubt a fundamental resource for a variety of quantum information processing tasks , such as super - dense coding , quantum cryptography and quantum error correction [ 1 - 4 ] .",
    "strongly entangled , multi - partite states of qubits and qutrits are a central resource of quantum information science . these are frequently used in constructing many protocols , such as teleportation [ 5 ] , key distribution and quantum computation [ 6 ] .",
    "the phenomenon of sudden loss of entanglement also termed as entanglement sudden death \" esd has been investigated by a number of authors for bipartite and multipartite systems [ 7 - 10 ] .",
    "yu and eberly [ 11 , 12 ] showed that entanglement loss occurs in a finite time under the action of pure vacuum noise in a bipartite state of qubits .",
    "they found that , even though it takes infinite time to complete decoherence locally , the global entanglement may be lost in finite time .",
    "recently , researchers have focused on relativistic quantum information in the filed of quantum information science due to conceptual and experimental reasons . in the last few years , much attention had been given to the study of entanglement shared between inertial and non - inertial observers by discussing how the unruh or hawking effect will influence the degree of entanglement [ 1322 ] .",
    "most of the investigations in non - inertial frames are focused on the study of the quantum information in bipartite qubit system with one subsystem as an accelerated . since , it is  not possible to completely isolate a quantum system from its environment .",
    "therefore , one needs to investigate the behavior of entanglement in the presence of environmental effects .",
    "a major problem of quantum communication is to faithfully transmit unknown quantum states through a noisy quantum channel .",
    "when quantum information is sent through a channel , the carriers of the information interact with the channel and get entangled with its many degrees of freedom .",
    "this gives rise to the phenomenon of decoherence on the state space of the information carriers .",
    "implementation of decoherence in non - inertial frames have been investigated by different authors [ 23 , 24 ] .",
    "peres - horodecki [ 25 , 26 ] have studied entanglement of qubit - qubit and qubit - qutrit states and established separability criterion . according to this criterion , the partial transpose of a separable density matrix must have non - negative eigenvalues , where the partial transpose is taken over the smaller subsystem for qubit - qutrit case . for nonseparable states ,",
    "the sum of the absolute values of the negative eigenvalues of the partial transpose gives the degree of entanglement of a density matrix also termed as negativity .",

    ", we study the effect of decoherence on a qubit - qutrit system in non - inertial frames by considering different noise models , such as , amplitude damping , depolarizing and phase damping channels .",
    "we consider different couplings of the system and the environment where the system is influenced by global , local , or multi - local noises modeled in a number of scenarios .",
    "we show that entanglement degradation occurs for various coupling of the system and the environment .",
    "it is shown that different environments degrade the entanglement of the hybrid system differently .",
    "we consider a composite system of a qubit @xmath0 and a qutrit @xmath1 that is coupled to a noisy environment both collectively and individually .",
    "local and multi - local couplings describe the situation when the qubit and qutrit are independently influenced by their individual noisy environments . whereas , the global decoherence corresponds to the situation when it is influenced by both collective and multilocal noises at the same time .",
    "the term collective coupling means when both the qubit and qutrit are influenced by the same noise .",
    "the state shared by the two parties is an entangled qubit - qutrit state of the form [ 28]@xmath2where the two modes of minkowski spacetime that correspond to alice and rob are @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "we assume that alice remain stationary while rob moves with uniform acceleration .",
    "it is important to mention here that the above state is obtained after taking the trace over unobserved region iv [ 28 ] .",
    "the interaction between the system and its environment introduces the decoherence to the system , which is a process of the undesired correlation between the system and the environment .",
    "the evolution of a state of a quantum system in a noisy environment can be described by the super - operator @xmath5 in the kraus operator representation as [ 29 ]    @xmath6    where the kraus operators @xmath7 satisfy the following completeness relation    @xmath8    we have constructed the kraus operators for the evolution of the composite system from the single qubit kraus operators ( see table1 ) and qutrit kraus operators as given in equations ( 5 - 8 ) by taking their tensor product over all @xmath9 combination of @xmath10 indices    @xmath11    where @xmath12 and @xmath13 correspond to the number of kraus operators for a single qubit and qutrit channel respectively .",
