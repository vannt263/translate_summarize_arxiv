    "lenticular galaxies represent rather common morphological type in the nearby universe : they constitute up to 15%  of all galaxies in the field @xcite being at the second place after spirals .",
    "though they are more frequent in clusters , there is also a considerable population of quite isolated lenticulars @xcite , or of lenticulars in isolated pairs and triplets .",
    "lenticulars are thought to lack gas in general ; however just in the field the cold neutral hydrogen is found in up to 25% 45%  of all lenticulars , by the contrast with the cluster members @xcite . the difference in the gas detection frequency depending on environment density",
    "is sometimes explained by numerous mechanisms of gas removing from the large - scale disks which are effective only in dense environments . but this scenario can not explain the difference in gas kinematics depending on environment density : in the cases when the gas is found in cluster lenticulars , its rotation matches usually the rotation of the stellar components , while in the field s0s the gas kinematics is very often decoupled from that of the stellar components @xcite .",
    "probably , the main difference related to the environments must be looked for in the area of the gas acquisition conditions , and not in the area of its subsequent dynamical evolution .",
    "@xcite suggest that the gas in cluster lenticulars is provided by the mass loss of the stellar components , and so comes from an intrinsic source .",
    "field lenticulars are evidently feeded by external accretion ; but the sources of the external accretion are not often recognized unambiguously .",
    "there are two main mechanisms that have been suggested by theorists , and to make choice between them ",

    "so every new s0 galaxy with a significant kinematically decoupled gas component attracts close attention of investigators",
    ".    though small amounts of kinematically decoupled gas are common in lenticular galaxies settling in low - density environments @xcite , large counterrotating gaseous disks are rare , as well as gas - rich s0 galaxies at all . in the ( r)sa(rs)0 + galaxy ngc  3626 @xcite , located at the periphery of a massive x - ray detected group , all the gas found , including ionized , molecular , and neutral species , counterrotates the stellar component . in unbarred galaxies and also group members ,",

    "the identification of the large - scale stellar structures in ic  719 as the cold flat disks is supported by surface photometry .",
    "we extracted azimuthally averaged surface brightness profiles in the sdss @xmath60-bands and in the ukidss @xmath61-band using the iraf task ellipse @xcite ( see fig .  [ view_prof ] ) and found that the profiles are quasi exponential with a compact nuclear concentration and no presence of a massive bulge . at the radii of @xmath62 one can see an excess of the surface brightness , which apparently corresponds to the concentration of the secondary stellar component .",

    "an emission - line spectrum of every spatial bin was obtained by subtracting the stellar contribution ( i.e. , the best - fitting stellar population model ) from the observed spectrum .",

    "we plotted our measurements of emission lines onto the classical excitation - type diagnostic diagrams to identify the gas ionization source ( fig .",

    "one can see that all measurements are located in the area corresponding to photoionization by hot stars except a few central points which correspond to shock - like excitation or to that powered by a weak ( liner ) agn .",
    "due to the wide spectral range of the scorpio long - slit spectra covering a set of strong emission lines ( , [ o]@xmath455007 , , [ n]@xmath66 , [ s]@xmath67 ) we are able to determine oxygen and nitrogen abundances of the ionized gas . to do this we used so - called ns - calibration method @xcite which does not require [ o]@xmath68 lines .",

[ gas_abund ] .",
    "the losvd of ic  719 can be easily splitted by eye into two counterrotating stellar components ( fig .",

    "the early analysis by the atlas-3d team that was using the kinemetry approach involving one - component stellar population with the unified kinematics , returned the classification of ic  719 as a rotator , slow in the inner part . the galaxy was also included into a so called ` 2@xmath38 ' type , so was treated as a galaxy having two off - centered maxima of the stellar velocity dispersion @xcite . in fact , when the correct approach including two kinematically ( and evolutionarily ) decoupled ssps is applied , we find two fast ( counter- ) rotating stellar components even in the innermost region ( fig .  [ sauron_decomposed_maps ] ) . the off - centered spots of visibly high stellar velocity dispersion ( or of a widened losvd ) are in fact the locations the nearest to the center where two losvd branches start to separate .",
    "the gaseous component extracted from the sauron data after the fitting by two ssp rotates just as one of the stellar components ; the surface intensity of the h@xmath71 emission demonstrates a ring - like distribution with the radius of about @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ sau_emissions ] ) .                    by applying our two - component fitting to the ic  719 long - slit data obtained with the scorpio ( fig .",
    "[ long_slit_decomposed_profiles ] ) , we have obtained two counterrotating stellar components once again ; one of the los stellar velocity profiles coincides perfectly with the gas velocity profile , the other is mirroring .",
    "the amplitudes of both stellar los velocity profiles are similar . beyond the central part of the galaxy ,",
    "the stars corotating the ionized gas look somewhat younger ( @xmath55 gyr ) and more metal - rich ( [ z / h]@xmath56 dex ) than the counterrotating component ( @xmath57 gyr , [ z / h]@xmath58 dex ) .",
    "the bpt diagram diagnostics of the pure emission - line spectrum , which was obtained by subtracting the model stellar population spectrum from the observed one , has shown ( fig .",

[ gas_abund ] ) .",

    "they simultaneously measured both the kinematics and stellar population properties of the counter - rotating stellar disks of ngc  5719 and found that the stellar component , which rotates in the same direction as the ionized gas , is younger , less rich in metals , more @xmath73-enhanced , and less luminous than the main galaxy disk .",
    "their investigation defiantly confirmed the gas accretion scenario for the secondary stellar disk of ngc  5719 .",
    "later this team studied stellar populations in the two more well - known galaxies ngc  3593 and ngc  4550 hosting counter - rotating disks @xcite . in the both galaxies the secondary stellar components are less massive , more metal poor and @xmath73-enhanced than the main galaxy stellar disks , and co - rotate the ionized gas .",

    "both papers concluded that the most likely formation mechanism of the secondary stellar component in ngc  4550 is unusual gas accretion history .    what can be the origin of the counterrotating gas in ic  719 ?",
    "a standard answer could be ` merging ' or ` interaction ' .",
    "the chemistry of the gas which is not very metal - poor ( at least within the stellar body of the galaxy ) excludes the version that the extended counterrotating gaseous disk consists of the relic baryons never processed through the stars , so there is no reason to suspect cold accretion from large - scale cosmological filaments .",
    "meantime , ic  719 constitutes an isolated non - interacting pair with ic  718  a late - type galaxy of similar luminosity .",
    "moreover , neutral hydrogen mapping reveals huge gas cloud embedding both galaxies @xcite .",
    "the hi extended disk of ic  719 looks coplanar to the stellar disk of ic  719 though is much more extended  up to 100 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "is it an interaction with gas flows directed from the late - type neighbour onto the early - type one ? merging with some third galaxy seems improbable : the high mass of the gas ( at least 0.7 billion solar masses ) , together with the modest stellar mass of the galaxy , @xmath74 solar masses ( see @xmath8 in the table  1 ) , implies the necessity of merging galaxies with the mass ratio larger than 1:10 ; it means that the thin stellar disk could not survive during such merging @xcite unless very specific conditions were provided ",
    "intense hot halo gas cooling after the merger @xcite ( meantime , x - ray haloes are not reported around these galaxies ) or strictly coplanar satellite orbiting before the merger .",
    "meantime both stellar disks of ic  719 are rather cold dynamically .",
    "however , it is evident that the inner ionized - gas component having the same angular momentum has a strong connection with the secondary stellar disk , though star formation in the disk have started perhaps recently , because the bulk stellar populations in the large - scale stellar disk of the galaxy are of intermediate age , @xmath75  gyr .",
    "one can consider two accretion scenarios of the gas onto the galaxy . in the frame of the first one ,",
    "the gas was acquired through a single accretion event but then two starbursts have happened .",
    "early starburst has given rise to formation of the secondary stellar component and the last one continues now .",
    "the second scenario consists of two accretion events , each with a subsequent starburst .",
    "we prefer the latter scenario of gas accretion because the former one is inconsistent with the gas metallicity measured by us .",
    "indeed , under the first scenario we expect that the metallicity of the self - enriched gas would be higher then the stellar metallicity of the secondary component but the fig .",
    "[ gas_abund ] shows the opposite relation .",
    "the second scenario allows that the metallicity of the mixture of the metal - poor external gas with the inner enriched gaseous fraction may be below the metallicity of the secondary stellar component , that is consistent with our measurements .",
    "by adding our long - slit spectral observations to the panoramic spectroscopy with the sauron , we have detected extended counterrotating gaseous disk as well as a secondary stellar component corotating the ionized gas in the lenticular galaxy ic  719 .",
    "the gas counterrotation can be traced up to the optical borders of the galaxies ; moreover , the ionized - gas velocity profiles obtained by us are more extended than the stellar velocity profiles extracted from the same spectral data .",
    "the gas emission - line surface intensity demonstrates ring - like distributions within the disk of the galaxy ; according to the bpt - diagnostics from the line ratio confrontation , the gas in the rings is excited by young stars , so the extended disk of the ic  719 possess rather intense current star formation .",
    "we have demonstrated that the accretion history of the external gas onto ic  719 consist of two events , each with a subsequent starburst .    in any case , this field lenticular galaxy is growing its large - scale counterrotating stellar disk just now promising to become in the nearest future an analog of ngc  4550  the s0 galaxy which has two equal - mass counterrotating stellar disks @xcite and no current star formation @xcite .",

    "<S> since the stellar disk remains dynamically cool , we conclude that smooth prolonged accretion of the external gas from a neighboring galaxy provides current building of the thin large - scale stellar disk . </S>"
