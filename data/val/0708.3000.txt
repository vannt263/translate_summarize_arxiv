    "galaxies at the highest redshifts , z@xmath05 , are vital objects in observational cosmology .",
    "they formed during an era of one of the most dramatic phase changes in the history of the universe  the epoch of reionization .",
    "remarkably , these earliest galaxies were able to dictate the phase of the general medium in which all galaxies are imbedded .",
    "because of their enhanced [ @xmath3/fe ] ratios , which are the product of core collapse supernova enrichment , and old ages , the densest ( i.e. , globular clusters ) and most massive stellar systems ( i.e. , giant ellipticals ) are thought to have formed at such high redshifts in spectacular bursts of star - formation of relatively short duration ( @xmath4100 myrs to a 1 gyr ) .",
    "the short duration of the star - formation but the large accumulated mass must mean that these galaxies had very high star - formation intensities  the rate of star - formation per unit surface area .",
    "it is well - known that galaxies with high star - formation intensities drive vigorous outflows of metals and energy .",
    "such outflows from high redshift galaxies could have both cleared material from the galaxian surroundings allowing ionizing photons to escape as well as enriching the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . through this",
    "mechanism problems of how the igm was re - ionized and enriched in metals even at the highest redshifts yet observed ( this is the so - called `` pre - enrichment problem '' ) could be solved . but can we find direct evidence for this scenario in the physical properties of high redshift galaxies ?",
    "this is what we will attempt to address here .",
    "at z@xmath55 , there have been a number of significant spectroscopic surveys investigating the nature of lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs , or `` v- or r - band dropouts '' ) , two of which has been lead by some of the authors .",
    "there are now over 100 confirmed redshifts in total at z@xmath25 through the work of our eso large program ( the eso distant galaxy survey  ergs ; douglas et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) and the study of the `` bdfs '' ( e.g. , lehnert & bremer 2003 ; lehnert et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "the eso lp is based on the ediscs fields , which are 10 widely separated intermediate - redshift cluster fields , while the `` bdfs '' are four adjacent fields observable from paranal in winter .",
    "our total sample constitutes the largest sample of z@xmath05 lbgs ( `` r - band drop outs '' ) with spectroscopically confirmed redshifts . in all of these fields",
    ", we have deep r- , i- , z - band , and irac data ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath6 m ) . some of the fields also have observations in other optical / infrared bands , including mips 24@xmath6 m data and hst acs imaging .",
    "in addition , we have been studying a similar population of galaxies in the goods - s , taking advantage of the deep multi - wavelength data set ( verma et al . 2007 ) .",
    "from our analysis of some of these extensive data sets ( verma et al . 2007 ) , we conclude :    @xmath7 the lbgs at z@xmath85 are young , with typical ages less than 100 myrs , compact , with typical half - light radii of about 1 kpc , and are rapidly forming stars , 10 to 200 m@xmath9 yr@xmath10 .",
    "these ages are very young suggesting that they have been intensely forming stars for only a few dynamical times ( estimated from stellar mass estimates and sizes ) .",
    "they therefore may likely represent a population of `` primordial galaxies '' .",
    "@xmath7 these sources are generally so young that they likely did not substantially contribute to reionization .",
    "the estimates of their ages from sed suggests that they formed at redshifts of about 6 - 7 . their contribution to re - ionization would likely be after the universe was already substantially ionized .",
    "@xmath7 from sed fitting from the rest - frame uv through optical , the lbgs at z@xmath85 are typically about a factor of 10 less massive that similarly selected galaxies at z@xmath83 ( few x 10@xmath11 m@xmath9 compared to few x 10@xmath12 m@xmath9 ; shapley et al .",
    "these galaxies represent about 1% of the local mass density ( verma et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "@xmath7 the lbgs at z@xmath85 have high stellar mass surface densities , @xmath13@xmath82 - 6 x 10@xmath14 m@xmath9 kpc@xmath15 and have very roughly approximated core phase densities of 10@xmath16 pc@xmath17 km@xmath17 s@xmath18",
    ". both of these are similar to that of bulges and spheriods of m@xmath19 galaxies at low redshift .",
    "@xmath7 the lbgs at z@xmath85 have high star - formation intensities , well above that needed to drive winds at low redshift , @xmath200.1 m@xmath9 kpc@xmath15 yr@xmath10 ( figure 1 ; heckman 2001 ; lehnert & heckman 1996 ) .",
    "@xmath7 if the z@xmath85 drive strong outflows then they may be able to solve the `` pre - enrichment problem ''  whereby the metallicity of the igm does not appear to evolve strongly with redshift at least out to almost z=6 ( songaila 2001 ; ryan - weber et al .",
    "quantitatively ( crudely ) estimating the likely metal contribution of these galaxies suggests that they are able to solve the pre - enrichment problem ( see figure 2 ) ."

    "<S> in particular , we focus on evidence that these galaxies drive vigorous outflows and speculate that this population may solve the so - called `` pre - enrichment problem '' . </S>",
    "<S> the general picture that emerges from these studies is that these galaxies , observed about 1 gyr after the big bang , have properties consistent with being the progenitors of the densest stellar systems in the local universe  the centers of old bulges and early type galaxies . </S>"
