    "thermal fluctuations play much larger role in high @xmath0 superconductors than in the low temperature ones because the ginzburg parameter @xmath1 characterizing fluctuations is much larger . in the presence of magnetic field the importance of fluctuations in high @xmath0 superconductors",
    "is further enhanced .",
    "first of all , strong magnetic field effectively confines long wavelength fluctuations in direction perpendicular to the field so that the dimensionality of the fluctuations are reduced by two @xcite .",
    "moreover highly anisotropic bscco type layered superconductors are basically two dimensional and one expects further increase in the importance of fluctuations . under these circumstances fluctuations influence various physical properties and even lead to new observable qualitative phenomena like vortex lattice melting into vortex liquid far below the mean field phase transition line .",
    "it is quite straightforward to systematically account for the fluctuations effect on magnetization , specific heat or conductivity perturbatively above the mean field transition line using ginzburg - landau description @xcite .",
    "however it proved to be extremely difficult to develop a quantitative theory in the most interesting region below this line , even neglecting fluctuation of magnetic field and within the lowest landau level ( lll ) approximation .    to approach the region below the mean field transition line @xmath2 thouless @xcite proposed a perturbative approach around homogeneous ( liquid ) state in which all the  bubble ",
    "diagrams are resummed .",
    "the series provides accurate results at high temperatures , but become inapplicable for lll dimensionless temperature @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 in @xmath6 smaller than @xmath7 ( see the lines h4 - 6 on fig.3 for the case of @xmath8 which represent successive approximants ( the corresponding three dimensional plots appear in @xcite ) .",
    "generally , attempts to extend the theory to lower temperature by pade extrapolation were not successful @xcite .    alternatively , more direct approach to low temperature fluctuation physics would be to start from the abrikosov solution at zero temperature and then take into account perturbatively deviations from this inhomogeneous solution . experimentally it is reasonable since , for example , specific heat at low temperatures is a smooth function and the fluctuation contribution is quite small .",
    "this contrasts sharply with theoretical expectations .",
    "long time ago eilenberger calculated spectrum of harmonic excitations of the triangular vortex lattice @xcite .",
    "subsequently maki and takayama @xcite noted that the gapless mode is softer than the usual goldstone mode expected as a result of spontaneous breaking of translational invariance .",
    "the propagator for the phase excitations behaves as @xmath9 in @xmath6 .",
    "this unexpected additional softness not only enhances the contribution of fluctuations at leading order but also leads to disastrous infrared divergencies apparently at higher orders . as a result",
    ", whether the perturbation theory around the vortex state is reliable becomes doubtful .",
    "for example the contributions to free energy depicted on fig .",
    "2a and 2d are respectively @xmath10 and @xmath11 divergent ( @xmath12 being an ir cutoff ) in @xmath13 and the divergencies get worse at higher orders . in @xmath6 the situation is aggravated : the diagrams diverge as @xmath14 and @xmath15 also qualitatively the lower critical dimensionality for melting of the abrikosov lattice is @xmath16 and consequently infinite range vortex lattice in clean materials exists only at @xmath17 .",
    "one therefore tends to think that nonperturbative effects are so important that such a perturbation theory should be abandoned @xcite .",
    "however a closer look at the diagrams like fig.2a ( see details below ) reveals that in fact one encounters actually only milder divergencies in both @xmath6 and @xmath13 .",
    "this makes the divergencies similar to the so called spurious divergencies in the theory of critical phenomena with broken continuous symmetry . in such case",
    "one can prove @xcite that they exactly cancel at each order provided we are calculating a symmetric quantity .    in this paper",
    "we show that all the ir divergencies in free energy or other quantities invariant under translations cancel to the two loop order .",
    "the @xmath18 case was briefly reported in @xcite , here we present in detail the more complicated @xmath6 case .",
    "we calculate magnetization and specific heat to this order and compare the results with existing high temperature expansion , monte carlo ( mc ) simulation @xcite of the same system and experiments . qualitatively",
    "physics of fluctuating @xmath13 gl model in magnetic field turns out to be similar to that of @xmath6 spin systems ( or scalar fields ) possessing a continuous symmetry . in particular , although within perturbation theory the ordered phase ( solid ) exists only at @xmath19 in thermodynamic limit , at low temperatures solid with powerwise decay of the translational order or liquid ( exponential decay ) differs very little from solid in most aspects .",
    "therefore , one can effectively use properly modified perturbation theory to study quantitatively various properties of the vortex liquid phase .",
    "similarly physics of the @xmath6 gl model is analogous to that of the @xmath20 scalar theory with , say @xmath21 symmetry .",
    "this is equivalent to the anharmonic oscillator in quantum mechanics or the @xmath22 spin chain in statistical physics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section ii the model is introduced and the feynman rules for the loop ( low temperature ) expansion within the lll approximation are set up .",
    "the free energy to two loops is calculated using diagrammatic expansion in section iii .",
    "it is shown how all the infrared divergencies cancel exactly at least up to the two loop order . in section",
    "iv we compare the present expansion with the high temperature series , theory of tesanovic et al @xcite , available mc simulations and experiments . in section",
    "v we discuss qualitatively nonperturbative effects using the analogy with magnetic systems mentioned above . we exemplify this by calculating perturbatively the ground state energy of the @xmath21 invariant @xmath23 chain ( equivalent to the quantum mechanical anharmonic oscillator ) which exhibits similar ir divergencies .",
    "we argue that although the infinite range translational order is not present in this system , locally the system looks like a lattice and the perturbative results are valid up to exponential corrections .",
    "finally we briefly summarize the results and discuss the melting transition observed in experiments and some mc simulations , contributions of higher ll , and fluctuations of magnetic field in section vii .",
    "our starting point is the gl free energy : @xmath24 here @xmath25 describes a nonfluctuating constant magnetic field in landau gauge . in strongly type ii superconductors ( @xmath26 ) ,",
    "far from @xmath27 ( this is the range of interest in this paper ) magnetic field is homogeneous to a high degree due to superposition from many vortices . for simplicity",
    "we assume @xmath28 , @xmath29 although this dependence can be easily modified to better describe the experimental coherence length .    throughout most of the paper the following units will be used .",
    "unit of length is @xmath30 and unit of magnetic field is @xmath31 , so that the dimensionless magnetic field is @xmath32 .",
    "the dimensionless free energy in these units is ( the order parameter field is rescaled as @xmath33 ) :    @xmath34 .\\ ] ]    the dimensionless coefficient is @xmath35 where the ginzburg number is defined by @xmath36 and @xmath37 is an anisotropy parameter .",

    "it is normalized to the unit average @xmath50      within the lll approximation , which will be used here , the above solution becomes exact so higher orders in @xmath51 do not appear and @xmath52 can be expanded in a basis of quasimomentum @xmath53 eigenfunctions @xmath54 -\\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{b}y-{\\frac{k_{x}}{\\sqrt{b}}}-\\frac{2\\pi } { % a_{\\bigtriangleup } } l)^{2}\\right\\ } .\\ ] ] around the mean field solution : @xmath55 the shift @xmath56 of the fluctuating field will be generally different from its mean field value .",
    "the integration is over brillouin zone of the hexagonal lattice which has an area @xmath57 . @xmath58 and @xmath59 are  real  fields satisfying @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "they are somewhat analogous to the acoustic and optical phonons in usual solids with some peculiarities due to strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "for example the @xmath62 mode corresponds to shear of the two dimensional lattice .",
    "after we substitute eq.([shift ] ) into the free energy , the quadratic terms in fields define propagators , while the cubic and quartic terms give rise to interactions .",

    "however the expectation value of the field which is not a symmetric quantity is divergent . minimizing @xmath83 with respect to @xmath56 would lead to the following correction to the vacuum expectation value : @xmath84}{m_{o}^{2}({\\bf k})}+\\frac{[2\\beta _ { % { \\bf k}}-|\\gamma _ { { \\bf k}}|]}{m_{a}^{2}({\\bf k})}\\right\\ } .",
    "\\label{corrvev}\\ ] ]    due to additional softness of the @xmath62 mode the above integral diverges in the infrared region .",
    "this means that the fluctuations destroy the inhomogeneous ground state , namely the state with lowest energy is a homogeneous liquid in accord with the fact that the lower critical dimension for the present model is @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "it however does not necessarily means that perturbation theory starting from an ordered ground state is inapplicable .",
    "the way to proceed in such situations have been found while considering simpler models like @xmath20 @xmath86 model @xmath87 , @xmath88 discussed in detail in section v ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "to the two loop order one gets several classes of diagrams ( see fig.2 ) : the setting - sun ( @xmath89 ) , double bubble ( @xmath90 ) , and the  correction term  ( @xmath91 ) , which arises due to correction in the value of @xmath56 from eq.([corrvev ] ) .",
    "all of them can be expressed explicitly in terms of the function @xmath92 and @xmath93    _ 1 . setting sun diagrams . _",
    "the setting - sun diagrams are shown in fig.2a - d .",
    "the @xmath94 diagram is naively the most divergent one among them .",

    "using the explicit expansion for @xmath105 given in appendix a , one can in turn find those for @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 .",

    "the gibbs free energy to two loops ( finite parts of the integrals were calculated numerically ) is    @xmath139    where numerical values of the coefficient is @xmath140 .",
    "dimensionless entropy ( the lll scaled magnetization ) is : @xmath141 and specific heat normalized to the mean field value is @xmath142 we first compare the results with those of the high temperature expansion @xcite .",
    "these series are known now to the 12th order in @xmath143 @xmath144 successive partial sums for specific heat at low temperature are plotted on fig.3 ( dashed lines ) together with several orders of the high temperature expansion .",
    "low temperature expansion indicates that the specific heat ratio grows with @xmath3 . on the other hand",

    "4 . whether there is a melting phase transition either first order or continuous ( in @xmath6 it is necessarily of the kosterlitz - thouless variety ) can not be determined from series alone .",
    "both series expansions have a finite radius of convergence , but this fact alone is not enough to decide that the singularity is at real temperature ( it can be located in the complex plane as for example in the @xmath20 ising model ) .",

    "4 are in accord qualitatively with experiments of @xcite , and mc simulations of @xcite .",
    "the same data were fitted by the theory of tesanovic and coworkers @xcite , we can calculate the coefficients of the low energy expansions from their theory and we get : @xmath149 compared to our eq.([c2d ] ) .",
    "even the sign of the @xmath150 contribution is different .",
    "this theory is only an approximate one and perhaps some modifications are required in the low temperature limit .",
    "the dramatic cancellation of all the severe ir divergencies in the gl lll model up to @xmath14 at the two loop level looks a bit mysterious .",
    "although in critical phenomena the phenomenon of cancellation of  spurious  divergencies due to goldstone bosons is well known @xcite , here it occurs under rather extreme circumstances .",
    "the theory is below its lower critical dimensionality . to better understand what is involved in these cancellations we investigated a model which has similar symmetry properties , but is much simpler .",
    "as was mentioned in the introduction the physics of the @xmath151 dimensional gl theory is very reminiscent of that of the @xmath152 dimensional scalar theory with two fields possessing a continuous @xmath21 symmetry , see fig . 5",
    ", @xmath153 where the dot denotes the derivative in the only dimension considered as  time  and we are interested in the spontaneously broken symmetry case @xmath154 .",
    "this model is equivalent to quantum mechanics of the two dimensional anharmonic oscillator .",
    "of course one can solve this model nonperturbatively ( albeit using numerical solution of the differential equation , we are not aware of the closed form of the ground state energy ) . obviously the result is ir finite ( bounded from below by the classical energy and from above by variational gaussian energy ) @xcite .",
    "it is important to trace the origin of the ir divergencies in the intermediate steps of the perturbative calculation .",
    "although the calculation has been done using feynman diagrams ( steepest descent approximation of the path integral ) , like in gl  model above , it is useful to start from the standard time independent perturbation theory .",
    "here we first have to decide what is the main part @xmath155 and what will be a perturbation @xmath156 .",
    "the perturbative vacuum in which @xmath157 is degenerate and we have many choices of the  unperturbed part .",
    "one of them corresponding to the choice @xmath158 is : @xmath159 where @xmath160 and @xmath161 are conjugate momenta of the fields @xmath162 and @xmath163 respectively .",
    "the constant in @xmath164 is the classical energy .",
    "since any of these ground states are nonnormalizable , see fig.5 , the ir cutoff @xmath12 was introduced into @xmath155 .",
    "it also removes the vacuum degeneracy . with this cutoff",
    "the unperturbed wave function is : @xmath165 .\\ ] ]    zero point energy @xmath166 corresponds in the time dependent perturbation theory to @xmath167 in the time dependent formalism .",
    "the leading correction to the ground state energy is : @xmath168 it is equal to three ",
    "double bubble diagrams of fig.2 .",
    "the second order in @xmath169 correction is : @xmath170 this contribution is the sum of the  setting sun diagrams  and correction terms ( some terms which contain higher orders in @xmath171 were dropped ) . unlike the gl theory there is no @xmath94 setting sun diagram and therefore no @xmath172 divergence is expected .",
    "the leading divergence @xmath132 and the subleading @xmath12 cancel between @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "as is well known even discrete symmetry can not be broken spontaneously in @xmath175 this means that when we calculate perturbatively vev of a quantity which is not invariant under the symmetry group @xmath21 it should be ir divergent @xcite . as an example we calculate expectation value of @xmath176 . to first order correction to @xmath177 arises from the corrected ground state @xmath178 the result is @xmath179 it diverges linearly indicating  dynamical restoration  of the symmetry .",
    "the sign of the correction indicates that the vev is reduced .",
    "the exact finite size expression is nonanalytic ( like @xmath180 $ ] ) and approaches zero .",
    "this model clearly teaches us that although the @xmath21 symmetry is unbroken , the perturbation theory starting from the  broken  symmetry ground state not only cures its own ir divergencies problems , but provides an accurate approximation to any @xmath21 symmetric quantity .",
    "perturbation theory actually",
    " knows  about restoration of the symmetry missing only corrections of the essential singularity variety .",
    "to summarize , it is established up to order of two loops that perturbation theory around abrikosov lattice is consistent .",
    "all the ir divergencies cancel due to soft interactions of the soft mode .",
    "perturbative results as well as interpolation with the high temperature expansion agree very well with the direct mc simulation and experiments .",

    "let us briefly summarize what it physically means and under what conditions this result is valid .",
    "the fact that @xmath56 is ir divergent in both @xmath6 ( power ) and @xmath13 ( logarithm ) means that order parameter of translational symmetry breaking vanishes .",
    "its correlator at very large distances approaches zero .",
    "this does not necessarily means that the state is liquid , namely the correlator decays exponentially with certain correlation length .",
    "it might decay only as a power like in @xmath6 @xmath22 model @xcite and melt into liquid via either first order or continuous transition .",
    "assumptions are : no disorder , infinite sample , lll approximations , no fluctuations of magnetic field .",
    "the third assumption can be relaxed since one obtains a supersoft @xmath182 spectrum also after including higher landau levels , see @xcite , however including fluctuations of the magnetic field will probably stabilize the lattice in @xmath183 since the spectrum becomes the usual goldstone boson @xmath184 .        in this appendix",
    "we give formulas for expansion of integrands in powers of quasimomenta , which is needed to eighth order .",
