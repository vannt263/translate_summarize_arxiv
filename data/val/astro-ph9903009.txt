    "elliptical galaxies are anomalous in many respects when considered in the context of the standard ideas regarding galaxy and star - formation . despite the absence of star - formation today",
    "only minimal passive evolution has been identified to z@xmath01 , mainly from optical - ir colours of cluster sequences , which are marginally bluer than k - corrections predict ( stanford , eisenhardt & dickinson 1998 ) . at higher redshift",
    ", examples of luminous red galaxies are found with f and g - star dominated spectra ( dunlop 1996 ; spinrad 1998 ; broadhurst & frye 1999 ) .",
    "no bright blue precursors have been identified .",
    "the absence of precursors naively implies the early epoch was obscured by dust or restricted to unobservably high redshifts .",
    "benitez ( 1999 ) strongly limit any unobscured formation to z@xmath110 , in the deepest available vlt / nicmos images .",
    "support for early dust is controversial .",
    "claims of high star - formation rates from far - ir imaging of the hdf ( hughes et al 1998 ) have been corrected in the radio ( richards 1998 ) and identified with low redshift disk galaxies and agn . this is consistent with the non - detection of far - ir emission from targeted observations of optically luminous @xmath5 galaxies ( scott 1998 ) .    in the context of hierarchical models ,",
    "it is natural to view e / so galaxies as the end product of a merging process and hence to predict declining numbers with increasing redshift .",
    "locally at least , merging of disk galaxies is seen to create some spheroidal shaped objects ( schweizer & seitzer 1992 ) . at faint magnitudes claims",
    "have been made for a decline in the space density of red and/or elliptical galaxies at z@xmath11 , ( kauffmann , white , & charlot 1996 ; zepf 1997 ; franceschini 1997 ; kauffmann & charlot 1998 ; menanteau 1999 ; barger et al .",
    "1999 ) mainly on the basis of optical imaging .",
    "conflicting with this is the simplicity of structural and color relations between elliptical galaxies ( faber & jackson 1976 ) , particularly in rich clusters where coeval monolithic formation is inferred ( bower , lucey , & ellis 1992 ) .",
    "if gas rich mergers of spirals are to produce the ellipticals then the enhanced alpha - element abundance generated by a brief merger induced episode of star - formation is unacceptably diluted by the pre - existing snia - enriched ism ( thomas , greggio & bender 1999 ) . furthermore the mass of stars formed during a merger is limited by the general absence of an intermediate - age stellar population in post - merger ellipticals ( silva & bothun 1998 ; james & mobasher 1999 ) .",
    "metallicity is also a problem with monolithic collapse formation , as closed box star - formation does not account for the observed lack of low metallicity stars ( worthey 1994 ) but implies pre - enrichment of the gas ( thomas , greggio & bender 1999 ) .",
    "recently , distant red ellipticals and other spheroid dominated galaxies at 1@xmath6z@xmath62 have been detected in the deepest combination of optical - ir images  a small nicmos / vlt field ( benitez 1999 , treu 1998 , stiavelli 1998 ) .",
    "here we analyse a much larger sample of distant red galaxies by combining optical - ir photometry from both hubble deep fields , to measure the rates of spectral and density evolution (  3 , ",
    "4 ) with photometric redshift measurements (  2 ) and discuss new implications for their formation (  4 ) .",
    "the observations used here are the deep hst optical images in the ubvi ( williams et al .",
    "1996 , 1999 ) and the jhk images from kpno ( dickinson 1997 ) and from the sofi instrument on the ntt in the south ( da costa 1998 ) .",
    "we use the published zero - points , filter transmission and detector response curves .",
    "magnitudes are measured using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) , and photometric redshifts are estimated by maximizing the likelihood with respect to a set of instantaneous burst spectra calculated using the @xmath7 = -0.2 $ ] bruzual / charlot spectrophotometric package ( leitherer et al.1996 ) .",
    "stars are distinguishable to very faint magnitudes by both a stellarity index ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) and , interestingly for red stars , by a poor fit to redshifted red galaxy spectra .",
    "the first point to note is that the choice of metallicity does not significantly affect the redshift estimate .",
    "the break at 4000  is so sharp that with accurate optical - ir magnitudes the redshift can be determined to @xmath015% with a ruler .",
    "a comparison of photo - z s with the 10 spectroscopic redshifts of elliptical galaxies the hdf is very good with a hint of a @xmath8z=0.1 systematic overestimate .",
    "48 objects are found with seds well matched to early type galaxies .",
    "the majority clearly fit a de - vaucouleurs profiles and not an exponential ( fig 2 ) .",
    "the remainder are too faint in the optical and of too low resolution in the ir to constrain the morphology . in other words",
    ", our sample contains all objects consistent with a de - vaucoulours profile and a passively evolving sed .",
    "half of these galaxies lie at z@xmath11 and extend to z=2.5 .",
    "few if any moderately bright blue ellipticals ( @xmath9 at @xmath10 ) are missed this way .",
    "the spectra are compared in the restframe ( fig 1 ) . a clear evolutionary trend emerges towards a mid f - star dominated spectrum by @xmath11 .",
    "hotter a - star dominated spectra would be very easily recognized if ellipticals evolved further according to a standard imf at z@xmath12 , such young ( @xmath61gyr ) precursors being very bright and blue .",
    "this simple result suggests that the passive evolution of elliptical galaxies begins at @xmath2 . for approximately @xmath01 - 2gyrs after formation the spectrum of such a stellar population has no detectable spectral evolution , consistent with the slow evolution found here above @xmath12 ( fig 1 ) .",
    "this level of evolution corresponds to a change in magnitude in the rest - frame b of only @xmath13 between z@xmath02 and the present .",
    "a small but detectable variance among seds is observed at any redshift ( fig 1 ) with evidence for greater homogeneity at high redshift .",
    "the bluest 3 objects marking the starting point of the color - colour tracks in fig 3 are estimated to lie in the range 1@xmath6z@xmath62 .",
    "these objects contain a small blue excess in u and b relative to an f - star spectrum ( fig 2 , bottom panel ) which is spatially distributed like the general light profile ( fig 2 ) , ruling out an agn contribution . accommodating this with some a - star light",
    "steepens the ir appreciably , requiring a redder imf for a good fit .",
    "nebular continuum emission is an interesting possibility .",
    "spectroscopy would be very helpful in understanding these relatively blue ellipticals .",
    "a proper assessment of density evolution requires simulated images to account for the very strong redshift dependent k - correction .",
    "simulations are made in all bands using the local luminosity function of early type galaxies ( pozzetti et al 1998 ) and matched in background noise , pixel scale and psf of each passband , using a variation of the machinery described in bouwens , broadhurst & silk ( 1998 ) .",
    "selection and photometry of both the observed and simulated images is performed identically .",
    "fig 3 shows a comparison with a model in which the density is fixed and only the observed minimal spectral evolution takes place to @xmath14=2.5 .",
    "it is clear that the numbers and luminosities of red galaxies has not changed much between z@xmath02 and the present , in agreement with the claim of benitez ( 1999 ) , but inconsistent with other estimates , in particular previous optical work .",
    "the unknown volume at high redshift translates into an uncertainty in the predicted numbers at z@xmath11 , so that both low @xmath15 and flat @xmath16 dominated models underpredict the data by @xmath030% .",
    "our findings show that the passive evolution of ellipticals evolves slowly to a mid - f star spectrum by @xmath11 .",
    "bluer ellipticals are conspicuous by their absence , and at face value , this simply suggests that the main sequence in elliptical galaxies does not extend above @xmath17 .",
    "it is also clear that most elliptical galaxies form at z@xmath11 given the lack of any significant decline in their space density with redshift , subject to a factor of  30% uncertainty from the unknown volume .",
    "these conclusions are surprising given the high metal content of ellipticals and implies some gas pre - enrichment .",
    "this requirement is more palatable in light of recent evidence of outflows in higher redshift star forming galaxies , in particular lensed galaxies for which there is sufficient signal to detect blueshifted ism absorption lines ( franx 1997 ; frye & broadhurst ; frye 1999 ) .",
    "such outflows will be preferentially enriched with alpha - elements from snii activity .",
    "independent of the observed outflows , renzini ( 1997 ) has argued convincingly that snii enrichment of the icm is indicated by the predominantly alpha - element enriched gas . in the context of hierarchical evolution early enriched material will cool onto the later forming more massive halos .",
    "locally , examples of near solar enriched cooling - flow x - ray gas is found in groups and clusters of galaxies centered on giant ellipticals of similar metallicity ( finoguenov & ponman 1999 ) .",
    "we suggest that cooling may be responsible for the formation of the stellar content of elliptical galaxies more generally , naturally leading to a bottom heavy imf consistent with our results .",
    "inviting this simple picture is the remarkable correspondence between the most luminous x - ray cooling gas with impressively large cd galaxies ( fabian , nulsen , & canizares 1991 ) .",
    "hence it is perhaps not surprising to find that such objects contain _ young _ stellar populations ( mehlert 1997 ) if this cooling gas forms visible stars .",
    "a clear test of the possible role of cooling flows in the formation of spheroidal galaxies will be provided soon by deep field x - ray imaging , like the planned deep axaf field ( giacconi 1999 ) . constraining the numbers of even higher redshift red galaxies",
    "requires deeper ir imaging to explore beyond z=2 .",
    "the isaac camera on the vlt has the area and efficiency to achieve this , extending @xmath18 magnitudes fainter than the relatively low resolution @xmath04 m ir imaging used here .",
