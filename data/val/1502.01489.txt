    "methods to create long - range entanglement have attracted a lot of attention due to their importance in several protocols in quantum information science @xcite .",

    "quantum discord is more robust than entanglement @xcite .",
    "further , for certain disspative processes , entanglement is known to vanish in finite evolution times , a phenomena known as entanglement sudden death ( esd ) @xcite , while quantum discord remains finite .",

    "we evaluate the freezing length , @xmath138 , as @xmath95 is varied , for a fixed @xmath96 .",
    "@xmath109 can therefore be seen as a function of @xmath96 .",
    "the anisotropy transition in the system at @xmath137 driven by the change in the anisotropy parameter , @xmath135 , can be detected by using @xmath139 as the order parameter .",

    "it is immediately seen that the observed freezing is present for low thermal excitations and only vanishes when the temperature crosses a critical value ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "the observation shows that for finite sizes the freezing of long - range quantum discord is robust against thermal fluctuations below a certain critical value of temperature , @xmath153 , which decreases linearly with increasing @xmath1 , as shown in the inset of fig .",

    "another interesting phenomena that accompanies the freezing of long - range quantum correlation is the behavior of the energy gap in the quantum spin chain . for the system under consideration",

    "the adiabatic freezing of long - range discord can be an important tool to implement and investigate other interesting properties of quantum spin chains .",
    "for example , one can consider the effect of finite interaction between the two end spins , thus allowing a closed boundary effect in the dynamics of the spin chain .",
    "we have observed that for weak coupling between the end spins , the value of frozen discord can be increased without affecting the freezing length .",

    "preliminary investigations reveal that the perfect freezing of long - range quantum discord is disturbed by applying an external field .",
    "however , the rate of decay of long - range discord , for increasing @xmath95 , suffers a sharp change in curvature , which can be quantified to study important properties .",

    "<S> establishing long - range quantum correlation is an integral part of several quantum information processing tasks . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a process to create quasi long - range quantum discord between the non - interacting end spins of a quantum spin chain , with the end spins weakly coupled to the bulk of the chain . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the process is not only capable of creating long - range quantum correlation but the latter remains frozen , when certain weak end - couplings are adiabatically varied , provided they are below certain thresholds . </S>",
    "<S> we term this phenomenon as adiabatic freezing of quantum correlation , which is robust to moderate thermal fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the energy gap of the system can remain frozen for the adiabatic variations . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , considering the end spins as probes , we show that the freezing length can detect the anisotropy transition in quantum @xmath0 spin chains . </S>"
