    "lattice gauge wilson loop computations convincingly demonstrate that the interquark interaction grows linearly with distance .",
    "however , these computations are , somewhat paradoxically , made in the pure gauge theory : colour sources and sinks are taken to be static and virtual quarks are omitted .",
    "it is expected that the introduction of light quarks will allow the chromoelectric flux tube to break thereby screening the wilson loop confinement potential at a range given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the lattice string tension , @xmath2 is the mass of a light quark ",
    "static source system , and @xmath3 is the mass of the heavy quark .",
    "the constituent quark model is similar to quenched lattice gauge theory in the sense that nonvalence quark effects are neglected ( or are absorbed into parameters ) in both formalisms . incorporating quark loop ( for example , meson creation ) effects in the quark model",
    "has been a longstanding goal of hadronic physics@xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural to enquire whether the use of screened potentials in the constituent quark model can account for some of these effects . indeed",
    "several papers have appeared recently which use this idea and which claim good agreement with experiment@xcite .",
    "more fundamentally , does the constituent quark model survive unquenching ?",
    "it is possible that mass shifts induced by meson loops will severely distort the spectrum .",
    "i shall demonstrate that this need not be the case with the aid of a simple example below .",
    "it is also argued that the use of screened potentials is not a well - founded approach to unquenching the quark model .",
    "an obvious problem is that the bound state spectrum disappears above the ` ionization ' energy , @xmath4 . while one may regard this as satisfactory if hadrons become so broad as to be unrecognizable above the ionization energy , there is no evidence of this in the spectrum",
    "furthermore , the prospect of free quarks emerging at higher energies is not in keeping with the current understanding of confinement .",
    "a defining characteristic of the quark potential model is that the number of constituents in any hadronic system is fixed .",
    "how this property is modified in a field theoretic context can be illustrated by considering the interaction between electrons in lattice qed . in this case , the quenched wilson loop interaction may be interpreted as a potential because the imposition of the infinite electron mass limit removes all non - instantaneous interactions from the theory .",
    "the resulting interaction is then simply @xmath5 .",
    "unquenching qed introduces light fermion loop corrections to the instantaneous interaction ( and light - by - light scattering effects ) and this interaction can no longer be interpreted as a potential .",
    "specifically , as the momentum transfer increases , the virtual fermion pair can go on shell and the number of constituents has changed . increasing the momentum transfer further creates highly virtual @xmath6 pairs , and the potential interpretation of the interaction is regained .",
    "the generic situation is shown in fig .",
    "it is typical to focus attention on the lowest adiabatic surface , which has suffered obvious modification .",
    "however , higher surfaces remain and , as the dashed line in the figure indicates , the concept of a @xmath7 potential is still possibly useful .",
    "this will be demonstrated in the next section .",
    "it is convenient to define a simple field theoretical model which plays the role of full qcd .",
    "the tractability of the model is greatly enhanced by employing nonrelativistic kinematics .",
    "this choice has no bearing on the qualitative conclusions presented here .",
    "the model hamiltonian is    @xmath8    where the field is defined in terms of particle operators as    @xmath9    and the @xmath10 are pauli matrices acting on the quark ",
    "antiquark doublet .",
    "the flavour index @xmath11 takes on two values representing a heavy quark species of mass @xmath3 and a light quark species of mass @xmath12 ( denoted @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the following ) .",
    "the theory is truncated by projecting onto the lowest two fock space sectors via the ansatz    @xmath15    here the wavefunctions @xmath16 represent mesons , @xmath17 are center - of - mass wavefunctions which will be irrelevant in the following , and @xmath18 is the relative two - meson wavefunction .",
    "the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 are quark mass ratios defined as @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the ansatz has been specialised to the case representing a @xmath23 meson and the @xmath24 continuum .",
    "we shall restrict attention to the light quark loop modifications of heavy mesons ( loop effects on the heavy - light mesons and light - light mesons do not change the qualitative conclusions presented here ) . computing @xmath25 under these restrictions and varying with respect to @xmath16 and @xmath18 yields the coupled equations    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the distance between the quarks in the meson and @xmath28 is the intermeson coordinate ; these are related by @xmath29 . additionally ,    @xmath30    @xmath31    and    @xmath32 \\psi(\\rho ) + \\nonumber \\\\ & &   \\int d^3r\\ , v_e(r,\\rho)\\psi(r ) - \\nonumber \\\\ & &   e \\int d^3r\\ , n(r,\\rho ) \\psi(r ) .",
    "\\label{rgm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the dependence on @xmath19 emerges because quark pair creation at a point forces @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( see the argument of @xmath18 in eq .",
    "[ psi ] ) .",
    "the factor @xmath35 is due to the integral @xmath36 which occurs upon taking the functional derivative of @xmath37 with respect to @xmath38 .",
    "its presence can be confirmed by checking hermiticity of eq .",
    "[ fulleq ] .",
    "[ rgm ] describes the interactions of the heavy - light mesons and is in the form of a resonating group equation@xcite .",
    "the kernels @xmath39 and @xmath40 are nonlocal exchange and normalisation kernels whereas @xmath41 is the direct interaction obtained by convoluting the quark potential with mesonic wavefunctions .",
    "the equations are simplified further by neglecting final state interactions in the meson - meson channel .",
    "self energy diagrams are assumed to be entirely renormalised away and a single continuum channel is used .",
    "again , none of these simplifications qualitatively change the conclusions .",
    "the model specification is complete upon assuming an sho interaction    @xmath42    with spring constant @xmath43 gev@xmath44 and hence @xmath45 mev .",
    "this fixes the heavy - light meson wavefunction yielding a transition operator of    @xmath46    with @xmath47 .",
    "finally quark masses shall be taken to be @xmath48 gev and @xmath49 gev . the sho strength and the quark masses",
    "were chosen so that the model is a facsimile of the upsilon system . as is typical in constituent quark models , a flavour - dependent constant",
    "is added to the hamiltonian . in this case",
    "@xmath50 gev , yielding a ` b ' meson mass of @xmath51 gev .    in the following the @xmath7 interaction",
    "shall be called the ` bare ' interaction .",
    "it is denoted by the solid line in fig .",
    "the screened interaction is obtained from eq .",
    "[ fulleq ] by diagonalisation in the static quark limit .",
    "the results are the dashed lines in fig .",
    "2 . of course the screened potentials have the expected adiabatic surface crossing at @xmath52 gev@xmath53 .",
    "it is also significant that the screened potentials exhibit a modified short range behaviour .",
    "according to lore the adiabatic screened potential is only modified near the continuum threshold , but , as shown here , the @xmath27-dependence of the transition amplitude can affect the screened potential at short range .",
    "this can have important phenomenological effects on hadron properties and can , for example , substantially modify the assumed short range behaviour of the constituent quark model .",
    "it is convenient to solve the coupled channel problem by integrating out the bound state channel .",
    "the effective potential which describes the bound state physics is    @xmath54    where @xmath55 are the eigenenergies of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the bethe - heitler equation is solved with the addition of a weakly coupled probe channel to locate the poles in the t - matrix .",
    "a typical computation is shown in fig .",
    "heavy meson poles below threshold are quite narrow and easily seen by the probe channel .",
    "identifying resonance locations above threshold is more difficult and hence argand diagrams were often employed .",
    "this was essential in the case of the unquenched light meson spectrum because of the strong scattering which takes place in the @xmath58 channel .",
    "in the tables below , the real part of the poles are referred to as the ` full ' spectrum .",
    "the mass spectra for four possible solutions to the full problem of eq .",
    "[ fulleq ] are presented here :    \\(i ) the bare spectrum obtained by solving @xmath59 ;    \\(ii ) the screened spectrum obtained by employing the screened potential , @xmath60 in the bare hamiltonian ;    \\(iii ) the renormalised spectrum ; ( iv ) the full spectrum obtained by solving the full hamiltonian , eq .",
    "[ fulleq ] .",
    "the renormalised hamiltonian is obtained by fitting the oscillator frequency @xmath61 and quark mass @xmath62 to the full ( ` experimental ' ) low lying spectrum .",
    "this mimics the procedure followed with the quark model and serves as a point of comparison with the full model and the two alternate truncations .",
    "as mentioned above , the use of the screened potential is frequently adopted in hadronic physics in an attempt to model the effects of coupled channels .",
    "the efficacy of this idea will be tested by comparing with the full spectrum below .",
    "model parameters were chosen to mimic the upsilon system : @xmath63 gev , @xmath49 gev and @xmath64 gev .",
    "the lightest heavy - heavy meson has a mass of 9.96 gev , the lightest heavy - light meson is 5.4 gev , and the ` upsilon ' decay threshold lies between the second and third heavy - heavy states at 10.8 gev",
    ".    .heavy meson spectra ( gev ) [ g=100 mev ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      the lessons of the previous section can be profitably applied to lattice gauge computations of adiabatic potentials and their mixing .",
    "the canonical application is to the wilson loop potential .",
    "in particular , extensive effort has been devoted to finding ` string breaking ' in the wilson loop potential in unquenched qcd@xcite ; yet the expected surface crossing to the meson - meson continuum has been surprisingly difficult to observe .",
    "the common explanation is that better operators are required to see string breaking .",
    "but there is a simpler explanation : the confinement potential and the meson - meson continuum are connected via a fock sector transition operator which happens to be small .",
    "indeed , the mixed adiabatic surfaces are estimated to be split by only 50 mev@xcite .",
    "thus surface mixing can not be observed on the lattice unless large temporal separations are achieved@xcite .",
    "a recent lattice computation which finally observes string breaking confirms these assertions : large temporal extensions in wilson loops were required and the calculated adiabatic potential gap is roughly @xmath65 mev@xcite .",
    "a second example from the lattice illustrates the importance and the subtlety of surface mixing in modelling .",
    "we consider the static energy of the first excited state of the flux tube in the quenched approximation , denoted as the @xmath66 adiabatic potential .",
    "this potential describes the quark dynamics of a heavy hybrid meson state . as seen in fig .",
    "[ vcross ] , the @xmath66 potential increases at short distance , in keeping with the expected perturbative colour octet interaction of @xmath67 .",
    "however , it becomes energetically favourable for the system to emit a gluon once the interquark separation becomes sufficiently small .",
    "this gluon combines with the ` valence ' gluon of the hybrid to form a scalar glueball , thereby changing the quark colour configuration to that of a singlet , and hence the adiabatic potential to the attractive @xmath68 form . in short ,",
    "it is energetically favourable for the hybrid to convert to a ground state meson and a glueball at short distances .",
    "the point at which this should happen is indicated by the arrow in fig .",
    "[ vcross ] .",
    "it is thus somewhat perplexing that the lattice data passes through this point with no transition seen .",
    "it is possible that the expected surface mixing does not occur because the minimal relative momentum permitted on the lattices employed in the study were too coarse to permit the required hybrid decay .",
    "however , a physical reason for the suppression of this coupling is also possible .",
    "for example , if one considers the hybrid to be dominated by a fock space component consisting of a constituent quark , antiquark , and gluon , then the postulated transition occurs through gluon emission from either the valence gluon or a valence quark . in the former case",
    "the coupling to a glueball is zero due to the colour overlap while in the latter case the coupling is suppressed by the large ( infinite ) quark mass .",
    "thus one expects the coupling between the surfaces to be very small , which implies that the surface mixing will not be seen unless lattices with exceptionally large temporal extents are employed .    while this is a plausible explanation for the observed short range behaviour of the @xmath66 potential it begs the question : which surface should one use when modelling heavy hybrids ?",
    "the observations of the previous section dictate that one should use the unmixed lattice potential  mixing is a non - potential effect and should not be considered in valence hybrid models ( in the same way that screened potentials are not useful for modelling excited canonical mesons and baryons)@xcite .",
    "the lessons gleaned from the simple mixing model presented here are directly applicable to the constituent quark model .",
    "one sees , for example , that mixing with the continuum can induce an effective short range interaction .",
    "this interaction is in general spin - dependent and can have a substantial effect on phenomenology .",
    "sorting out spin - dependence due to gluon exchange , instantons , relativistic dynamics , and continuum mixing remains a serious challenge for model builders@xcite .",
    "another lesson concerns the lore that passing the lowest continuum threshold in a given channel is associated with a deterioration of the quality of potential models of hadrons .",
    "but we have seen that hadron masses are shifted throughout the spectrum ( including below threshold ) due to a given channel . rather , it is the proximity of a continuum channel which can cause local distortions of the spectrum .",
    "of course , the problem in hadronic physics is that continuum channels tend to get dense above threshold .",
    "a number of additional issues complicate the application of these ideas to hadronic physics .",
    "for example , the qcd transition operator is determined by nonperturbative gluodynamics and is certainly not as simple as that of eq .",
    "in addition , as stated above , many continuum channels are present .",
    "summing over these is nontrivial  indeed the sum may not converge ( see for example , ref .",
    "furthermore , one expects that when the continuum virtuality is much greater than @xmath69 quark - hadron duality will be applicable and the sum over hadronic channels should evolve into perturbative quark loop corrections to the wilson loop / quark model potential .",
    "correctly incorporating this into constituent quark models requires marrying qcd renormalisation with effective models and is not a simple task .",
    "finally , pion and multipion loops can be expected to dominate the virtual continuum component of hadronic states ( where allowed ) due to the light pion mass .",
    "this raises the issue of correctly incorporating chiral dynamics into unquenched quark models .",
    "the relationship of chiral symmetry breaking to the constituent quark model has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and a variety of hadronic models which incorporate chiral symmetry breaking exist@xcite but much remains to be achieved .",
    "the results presented here imply that , in analogy with the renormalised model , constituent quark models must become progressively less accurate high in the spectrum .",
    "however , this effect is likely to be overwhelmed by more serious problems : the nonrelativistic constituent quark model must eventually fail as gluonic degrees of freedom are activated and because chiral symmetry breaking ( which is the pedestal upon which the constituent quark model rests ) becomes irrelevant for highly excited states@xcite .",
    "it is clear that an exploration of the excited hadron spectrum is required to understand the interesting physics behind the unquenched quark model , gluonic degrees of freedom , and chiral symmetry breaking .",
