    "chiral symmetry and its dynamical breakdown is crucial to the nature of the strong interaction spectrum and the study of this in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , and models thereof , is of great current interest .",
    "the most striking signals of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) are found in the kinematic and dynamical properties of the pion and one tool that has been used extensively to study these properties is chiral perturbation theory ( chpt)@xcite .",
    "chiral perturbation theory can be understood as the study of the necessary consequences of the chiral ward identities via the construction of an effective action , using field variables with pionic quantum numbers , in such a way as to ensure that these identities are realised .",
    "it should be noted that in this approach the pionic field has no physical significance - it is merely an auxiliary field - and should not be identified with the physical pion@xcite .    at first nonleading order in chpt , o(e@xmath2 ) ,",
    "the effective action is only completely determined once the effect of one - pion loops , generated by the o(e@xmath3 ) part of the action , is included .",
    "the regularisation of the divergence of each of these loops introduces ten arbitrary parameters at this level .",
    "the theory is not renormalisable but the approach is nevertheless useful because higher order loops do not contribute to the o(e@xmath2 ) action@xcite ; i.e. , the action at o(e@xmath2 ) is completely specified once the effect of the o(e@xmath3 ) loops is taken into account and the 10 parameters fixed by comparison with experimental data .",
    "the pion ( or , more generally , pseudoscalar ) loops in chpt are characteristic of the approach and , indeed , are sometimes regarded as being the dominant feature .",
    "the expression for every physical observable receives a contribution from such loops which depends on the mass of the particle in the loop and which diverges in the chiral limit . for example , in the case of the electromagnetic pion charge radius the loop introduces a logarithmic dependence and hence a logarithmic divergence in the chiral limit .",
    "herein we are interested in estimating the importance of these loop contributions , evaluated at real pseudoscalar masses , relative to what one might call the `` quark core '' contribution and our exemplary case will be the electromagnetic charge radius of the pion .",
    "the pseudoscalar mesons are the simplest bound states to study within the coupled dyson - schwinger  bethe - salpeter equation approach to qcd , recent reviews of which can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in vector exchange theories with dcsb , such as qcd , the goldstone - boson character of the pseudoscalar excitations can be understood through the existence of an identity between the fermion dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) and the pseudoscalar bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) .",
    "if , in the limit , this bse reduces to the dse then dcsb necessarily entails the existence of massless pseudoscalar excitations .",
    "this result was established for the rainbow - dse  ladder - bse pair in ref .",
    "( the rainbow approximation in the dse is equivalent to the ladder approximation in the bse . ) in this approach , the `` quark core '' of a meson is described by the bethe - salpeter amplitude obtained as a solution of the pesudoscalar bse ; the kernel of which , in practice , is often constructed as a generalised ladder kernel : generalised in the sense that the quark propagators are obtained as solutions of the rainbow dse with a gluon propagator whose large spacelike-@xmath4 behaviour is that given by the renormalisation group in qcd and whose small spacelike-@xmath4 behaviour is modelled so as to ensure confinement@xcite .",

    ", the parameters in the gcm describe the quark - quark interaction at small spacelike-@xmath4 .",
    "the model represents qcd as an effective two - point theory , coloured quark currents interact via dressed gluon exchange , and has the `` disadvantage '' that there is some model dependence in the results : for example , it predicts values for the parameters that appear in the effective lagrangian of chpt@xcite .",
    "however , since these parameters have been fitted to low energy phenomena in qcd , this provides a means of checking the model assumptions in the gcm . thus the model dependence is also an advantage : the assumptions on which the model is founded can be tested and this enables the development of an understanding of hadronic phenomena in terms of quark and gluon interactions .",
    "herein , in the context of the gcm , we calculate the electromagnetic charge radius of the pion taking into account both the `` quark core '' and the pion - loop rescattering correction .",
    "the `` quark core '' contribution , obtained in a generalised impulse approximation@xcite , is regular in the chiral limit whereas , as noted above , the pion - loop contribution is not .",

    "the meson cloud associated with a given hadron is a small correction in this framework and is obtained through a systematic expansion based on the effective action of the gcm .    in this approach the charge radius of the pion receives a contribution from its quark core and from pion loops .",
    "we showed that the quark core contribution is finite in the chiral limit and that , at the physical value of the pion mass , it is the dominant determining characteristic of the pion with the pion loop contribution being a small , finite , additive correction of less than 15% . the fact that the loop contribution is finite is a general property of this formalism ; it is due to the internal quark core structure which provides a natural cutoff in all integrals that arise .",
    "our result is consistent with a recent reanalysis of the pion charge radius obtained in lattice simulations@xcite .",
    "we explicitly identified the origin of the chiral divergence in the charge radius of the pion as arising from the pion loop ; this feature is not absent in the general dse - bse approach but is simply an higher order correction , as are all meson loop effects .",
