    "we discuss the origin of the emission in the context of profiles of other emission lines from tw hya and suggest that the line is formed in a disk , although formation in a heated photosphere can not be ruled out .",
    "if the [ ] emission is formed in a disk , the line width could result from keplerian rotation at a distance of 0.1 au from the star , tran - sonic turbulence , or detecting the front and back of a photoevaporative flow .",

    "the counts in each column of the off - source images are scaled to and then subtracted from the counts in the same column of the on - source sky background .",
    "this scaling is necessary because the second derivative of the sky brightness versus time was non - zero .",
    "we correct for fringing in the cross - dispersion direction by fitting a high - order polynomial to the residual background in each column .",
    "we extract the spectrum from a 7-pixel window centered on the source , and then subtract background sky spectra obtained from 20-pixel windows on both sides of the source .",
    "fringing in the spectral direction is not detected or corrected for because of the low s / n in the continuum ( table 1 ) .",
    "we estimate the telluric correction for each observation by interpolating the standard spectra of iris and @xmath3 cma at intermediate airmasses . the atmospheric correction is applied to each nod prior to combining the images .",
    "several o@xmath15 , co@xmath2 , and h@xmath2o lines are present in the wavelength range of our spectra . we calibrate wavelengths to an accuracy of @xmath16  per pixel using a 2nd - order fit to sky emission lines identified with atran @xcite .",

    "we estimate a radial velocity of @xmath24  by averaging the radial velocities of the t tauri stars go tau and v955 tau @xcite , which are both about 10@xmath25 from dp tau .",
    "figure 1 shows our michelle spectra of tw hya , bp tau , and dp tau . the continuum is detected from each target .",

    "the upper limits are calculated by assuming the same line profile as that of tw hya , and would be larger if the hypothetical lines from these objects were broader .",

    "two components ( a broad component at the stellocentric velocity with a flux enhancement on the blue side of the line ) are visually apparent in the line profile . however , based on the s / n detected in the continuum ( table 1 ) the profile shape is not a significant deviation from a single gaussian profile",
    ". the telluric co@xmath2 line did not divide out sufficiently for some of the tw hya observations and results in increased uncertainty on the blue side of the line profile .",

    "lines commonly attributed to accretion , including @xmath51 and the @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 doublets @xcite , have much broader line widths than the [ ] emission from tw hya and are redshifted from the stellocentric velocity .",
    "second , we rule out fast outflows because the [ ] line is centered at or near the stellocentric velocity and is limited to low velocities .",
    "formation in a very slow outflow may be possible if both the front and back sides of the flow are visible .",
    "third , we rule out a chromospheric origin .",
    "some lines from table 2 are attributed to chromospheric emission and seen from main - sequence dwarfs and weak - line t tauri stars @xcite , but these lines are narrower than the [ ] line .",

    "however , these lines have larger energy upper levels than the fine - structure [ ] line and are unlikely to trace the same gas .",
    "more likely is the possibility that the [ ] line forms either in the inner disk or in a photoevaporative flow from the optically thin region of the disk , as suggested by the excitation energy ( 0.10 ev ) , width ( 21 ) , and velocity centroid ( @xmath39 ) of the line .",

    "irradiated disks are believed to produce the molecular line emission detected from tw hya in the fuv h@xmath2 , near - ir h@xmath2 , and fundamental co transitions @xcite .",
    "the emission arises from warm ( @xmath61 k ) gas , and the fuv h@xmath2 lines in particular require irradiation by strong fuv emission from the central star .",

    "2003 ) , @xmath66k ( as observed for tw hya ; herczeg et al .",

    "2007 ; hollenbach et al .",
    "2000 ) , respectively .",
    "this trend might indicate a common origin for the lines in a disk with an outwardly decreasing temperature gradient ( e.g. , carr et al .",
    "if the [ ] line width results from keplerian disk rotation , then the emission arises at an average distance of @xmath67 au of the star , assuming a @xmath68 inclination of the disk around tw hya @xcite .",
    "the trend might also indicate a common origin for the lines in a turbulent disk atmosphere with a vertically increasing temperature gradient,- i.e. , increasing ( transonic ) turbulent broadening higher in the disk atmosphere .",
    "for example , the line width of the [ ] emission could be explained entirely by turbulent broadening in 10,000 k gas . with a combination of keplerian rotation and turbulence",
    ", the line could form at disk radii larger than @xmath67 au and in gas cooler than @xmath69 k. alternatively , the width of the [ ] line could also be explained if the emission arises from a photoevaporative flow from the optically thin region of the disk ( at @xmath70 au ) .",
    "we explore these possibilities using simple scaling arguments to point out the challenges associated with these interpretations .",
    "the [ ] flux is converted to a mass from the einstein a - value of @xmath71 s@xmath37 @xcite , a solar ne / h abundance ratio of @xmath72 @xcite , a ne ionization fraction of @xmath73 , and an average atomic mass per atom of 1.4 . in lte",

    "based on the _ chandra _ x - ray spectrum of tw hya @xcite , 23% of photons with energies @xmath5 kev penetrate to depths of @xmath83()=@xmath84 @xmath36 , but only the hardest 3% of those photons can penetrate to @xmath83()=@xmath85 @xmath36",
    ". however , almost all euv photons longward of 100 and 500   are attenuated for @xmath83()@xmath86 and @xmath87 @xmath36 , respectively .",

    "the scale height of gas in hydrostatic equilibrium at @xmath90 au from tw hya can be estimated as @xmath91 au .",
    "@xcite calculated that the dust temperature is @xmath92 k at the inner dust truncation radius ( @xmath93 au ) . however , since only a small amount of micron - sized dust is present within the 4 au dust clearing radius @xcite , the gas temperature at these radii may be significantly hotter than the dust temperature .",
    "models of optically - thick disks with viscosity parameter @xmath94 suggest a gas surface density of 2590 g @xmath36 at 0.1 au from tw hya @xcite",
    ". the mass of the [ ] emitting region would be about @xmath95% of the total disk mass within 0.2 au of the star .",
    "the [ ] emission in this scenario traces a thin surface layer of the disk higher than one scale height above the disk midplane .",
    "this interpretation of [ ] emission is challenging if @xmath96 because the larger total mass traced by the [ ] emission would require an even larger geometrical disk height .",
    "this situation can be ameliorated if turbulent broadening contributes to or dominates the [ ] line width .",
    "if the disk atmosphere is turbulent and the turbulent velocity is close to the sound speed , then the fwhm of a line would be @xmath97  at @xmath69 k , consistent with the observed line width . at this temperature",
    "the [ ] emission could arise from a wide range of radii , perhaps extending out to 10 - 20 au .",
    "@xcite suggest that at 110 au , the gas within @xmath98 @xmath36 of the disk surface will be heated to 4000 k. at this temperature the average radii for formation of [ ] emission would be @xmath99 au from the star .",
    "approximately transonic turbulence in disk atmospheres is inferred from the intrinsic line broadening of co overtone emission from accretion disks ( carr et al .",
    "2004 ; najita et al .",
    "the dissipation of turbulence in disk atmospheres could also produce the extra heating that is needed to explain the strength of co fundamental emission from t tauri disks @xcite .",
    "while these observations refer to emission from cool , molecular disk gas that is located deeper in the disk atmosphere , similar transonic turbulence may characterize warmer , atomic gas higher up in the disk atmosphere where the [ ] emission may arise .",
    "indeed , simulations of weakly magnetized disks find that mhd turbulence generates a warm ( @xmath100 k ) disk corona with a transonic velocity dispersion above several disk scale heights @xcite .      on the other hand , in the disk dissipation models of alexander et al .",
    "( 2006ab ) euv irradation of the disk produces a @xmath69 k flow with a velocity of @xmath101  from the disk surface , near the gravitational radius @xmath102 ( see also hollenbach & gorti 2007 ) .",

    "any additional frontal illumination of the inner edge of the optically - thick disk at 4 au by fuv and x - ray photons may provide an additional heating source that could help puff up the disk or help launch the photoevaporative flow .",
    "if the [ ] emission is formed in a photoevaporative flow within 4 au of the star , the apparent line broadening could result from detecting [ ] emission from both the front and back sides of the disk .",
