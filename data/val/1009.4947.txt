    "gamma - ray binaries are a class of high energy and very - high energy emitting sources that consist of a massive star and compact companion ( mirabel 2007 ; dubus et al .  2010 ; mcswain 2010 ) .",
    "six such objects are known sources of tev emission : ls  5039 , cygnus  x-1 , cygnus x-3 , ls  i  + 61  303 , psr  b1259@xmath163 , and hess  j0632 + 057 .",
    "the massive star component is a luminous o - star in the first two , a probable wr star in the third , and a be star in the last three cases .",
    "all these massive stars have winds and the be stars also eject mass into an outflowing circumstellar disk .",
    "the interaction of this mass loss with a degenerate companion can lead to gamma - ray emission in several ways ( parades 2008 ) .",
    "first , if the companion is a pulsar , then a high speed wind from the mass donor can collide with the pulsar wind in a shock region , and inverse compton scattering of stellar photons with relativistic electrons in the shock can create gamma - rays ( dubus et al .",
    "second , if the companion is a black hole , then gas accretion can lead to the formation of relativistic jets , and gamma - ray emission may occur by inverse compton scattering from jet electrons and/or by the decay of neutral pions that originate in inelastic proton - proton collisions ( romero et al .  2007 ) .    recently , lucarelli et al .",
    "( 2010 ) announced the detection with the agile satellite ( tavani et al .",
    "2009 ) of gamma - ray emission above 100  mev from a new unidentified source , agl  j2241 + 4454 .",
    "the source has galactic coordinates of @xmath2 with an error circle radius of approximately @xmath3 .",
    "the source has not yet been detected by the nasa fermi gamma - ray observatory .",
    "the agile point sources found to date include pulsars , blazars , supernova remnants , and high mass x - ray binaries ( pittori et al .",
    "2009 ) , but there are no cataloged examples of any of these in the region close to agl  j2241 + 4454 ( lucarelli et al .",
    "we point out two possibilities that deserve further attention .",
    "first , brinkmann et al .  ( 1997 ) found an x - ray source and probable quasar in this region , rxj@xmath4 , that may be a possible source of gamma - ray flaring ( vercellone et al .",
    "2008 ) . however , there is no known optical counterpart ( radio designation b@xmath5 ) , which would probably appear at @xmath6 ( based upon the observed x - ray flux and an assumed frequency power law with @xmath7 ) .",
    "further multiwavelength observations are required to say anything more about the candidacy of this object .",
    "second , the area contains the galactic be star hd  215227 ( bd  + 43@xmath84279 , hip  112148 , mwc  656 ) , which is located at @xmath9 .",
    "this object was discovered as an emission - line star by merrill & burwell ( 1943 ) who estimated a spectral type of b0e , and the star was subsequently assigned types b5:ne ( harris 1955 ) , b3ne@xmath10 ( petrie & lee 1965 ) , and back to b0 ( hernndez et al .",
    "the classification is difficult because the spectral lines are very broad and weak ( the projected rotational velocity is @xmath11 km  s@xmath12 ; yudin 2001 ) and often blended with emission features . here",
    "we present new blue spectra of the target , and we argue that hd  215227 is a potential optical counterpart of agl  j2241 + 4454 based upon its probable runaway and binary character .",
    "we obtained blue spectra of hd  215227 with the hia dominion astrophysical observatory 1.8  m telescope on 2010 july 28 and 29 .",
    "these observations were made with the cassegrain spectrograph with grating 1200b ( 1200 grooves",
    "mm@xmath12 ) in first order , and the spectra cover the range 4260  4669  .",
    "the detector was the site-2 ccd ( a @xmath13 pixel array with @xmath14 @xmath15 m pixels ) , and the resulting spectra have a resolving power of @xmath16 as measured from the fe  ar comparison lines .",
    "exposures were 300  s in duration , leading to spectra with a s / n = 100 per pixel in the continuum .",
    "the spectra were extracted and calibrated using standard routines in iraf , and then each continuum - rectified spectrum was transformed to a common heliocentric wavelength grid in @xmath17 increments .",
    "the two spectra are illustrated in figure  1 .",
    "there is clear evidence of double - peaked emission from the circumstellar disk that is seen in the core of h@xmath10 and in numerous emission lines .",
    "the only clear photospheric lines are those of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we searched through the be star spectral survey of grundstrom ( 2007 ) , and the closest matching spectrum we found is that of hr  2142 = hd  41335 , which is shown for comparison in the top section of figure  1 .",
    "hr  2142 is a well known be binary system that shows deep , narrow , `` shell '' absorption features at certain phases in its 81  d orbit ( peters 1983 ) .",
    "the most prominent shell feature appearing in figure  1 is the sharp absorption core of h@xmath10 @xmath20 .",
    "such absorptions form in cooler , dense disk gas seen in projection against the stellar photosphere ( hanuschik 1995 ) , and their strength may be modulated by azimuthal asymmetries in disk density that can occur in be binaries ( oktariani & okazaki 2009 ) .",
    "we estimated a number of stellar parameters for the star by comparing the observed spectra with b - star model spectra from the tlusty / synspec grid of lanz & hubeny ( 2007 ) .",
    "the best fit model parameters from an iterative visual match of the synthetic and two observed spectra are listed in table  1 .",
    "the errors given in table  1 are based on our judgment of the boundary between reasonable and unsuitable solutions , and these are intentionally conservative given our incomplete understanding of emission contamination in the spectrum .",
    "we focused first on measurements based upon relative spectral intensity since we found clear evidence of a systematic line weakening due the presence of disk continuum flux .",
    "the projected rotational velocity @xmath21 was estimated from the shape of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 blend .",
    "the effective temperature @xmath24 derivation was based primarily on the @xmath22 to @xmath23 ratio .",
    "this ratio increases monotonically with increasing @xmath24 , although the ratio is almost independent of @xmath24 near @xmath25  kk , which corresponds to the peak of the strength .",
    "however , we can estimate @xmath24 even in this vicinity by the relative strength of the @xmath26 blend , which is stronger at higher @xmath24 .",
    "the gravity @xmath27 was determined by fitting the emission - free parts of the stark broadened , h@xmath10 line wings .",
    "we found that the model photospheric spectrum had line depths that were consistently deeper than the observed ones , and this is probably due to disk continuum flux in this spectral region .",
    "consequently , we renormalized the model spectrum by adding a pure continuum component with a disk - to - star , monochromatic flux ratio @xmath28 .",
    "this renormalized model spectrum is shown as the lower plot in figure  1 . finally , we estimated the radial velocity @xmath29 for both spectra by cross - correlating the observed and model spectra over the wavelength range including the emission - free h@xmath10 wings and @xmath30 .",
    "all these measurements are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the derived stellar parameters suggest a spectral classification of b3  ivne+sh , where the temperature  spectral type relation is taken from bhm - vitense ( 1981 ) , the gravity ",
    "luminosity class relation for like stars is adopted from the results of huang & gies ( 2008 ) , and `` n '' and `` e '' indicate broad lines and balmer emission , respectively .",
    "the final suffix `` sh '' is often used to denote the presence of shell lines , which is indicated here by the sharp , central absorption in h@xmath10 .",
    "note that a similar shell feature may be present in @xmath22 in the spectrum from the first night .",
    "wolff et al .  ( 2007 ) determined a surprisingly low value of projected rotational velocity , @xmath31 km  s@xmath12 , compared to our result .",
    "we suspect that their spectrum was obtained at a time when the shell lines dominated and that their measurement corresponds to the shell line width .",
    "the spectral properties of hd  215227 bear some resemblance to those of the gamma - ray binary ls  i  + 61  303 , which is a be star in a 26.4960  d orbit ( aragona et al .",
    "2009 ) . the h@xmath32 profile in ls",
    "i  + 61  303 displays systematic variations in the ratio of the violet - to - red ( @xmath33 ) peak emission around the time of periastron in this eccentric orbit ( @xmath34 ) binary ( grundstrom et al .  2007 ;",
    "mcswain et al .",
    "we find that the @xmath33 ratio of the h@xmath10 emission changed significantly in just one day ( fig .  1 ) , which is unusually fast for most be stars ( grundstrom 2007 ) .",
    "we suggest that such rapid variability might be associated with the changing tidal effects of a companion on the disk ( especially strong near periastron ) .",
    "if the disk in hd  215227 is modulated with a binary orbit , then the continuum flux from the disk may also show an orbital modulation .",
    "we found that the disk contributes @xmath35 of the total flux in the optical , so we might expect to find some evidence of the orbital modulation in broad - band photometry .",
    "in fact , koen & eyer ( 2002 ) found evidence of a 61  d periodicity in the _ hipparcos _ light curve ( 258 measurements ) .",
    "there are two other sets of photometric measurements from all sky survey experiments .",
    "the first set of 101 cousins @xmath36 measurements were made between 2003 and 2007 by the amateur sky survey ( tass ; @xcite ) .",
    "the second set of 52 points were made from 1999 to 2000 with the northern sky variability survey ( nsvs ; @xcite ) .",
    "since these three sets were made with different broad - band filters , we assumed that color variations are minimal and then simply subtracted the mean magnitude of each set to form a combined photometric time series .",
    "these residual magnitudes are based upon differences from the average values of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 for the _ hipparcos _ , tass , and nsvs photometry sets , respectively . a discrete fourier transform period search revealed one significant signal with a period of @xmath0  d , an epoch of maximum brightness at hjd  2,453,243.3 @xmath40 , and a semiamplitude of @xmath41 mag . the resulting light curve ( fig .",
    "2 ) displays a low - amplitude , quasi - sinusoidal variation that probably corresponds to the binary orbital period .",
    "note that the small radial velocity changes we observed over a one day interval are consistent with the small variations that are expected for an orbital period this long .",
    "we note that the galactic latitude of hd  215227 , @xmath42 , suggests that the star is quite far from the galactic plane , and hence it may be a runaway star formed by a supernova ( sn ) explosion in a binary system ( gies & bolton 1986 ; hoogerwerf et al .",
    "2000 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the sn explosion removes most of the mass of the progenitor star , and the stellar companion moves away from the explosion site with a speed comparable to its orbital speed at the time of the explosion . if the sn progenitor was the less massive component at the time of the explosion and if asymmetries in the sn outflow were modest , then the system remains bound as a runaway star with a degenerate companion .",
    "the runaway velocities may be large enough to move the system hundreds of parsecs away from the location of the sn over the lifetime of the stellar companion .",
    "the distance to the star is quite uncertain , but we can make an estimate by comparing the expected stellar radius from evolutionary tracks with the angular diameter derived by fitting the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "we interpolated in the single star evolutionary tracks of schaller et al .",
    "( 1992 ) to derive mass and radius estimates from the derived @xmath24 and @xmath27 parameters ( table  1 ) .",
    "we constructed the sed using uv fluxes from the td1 satellite ( thompson et al .",
    "1978 ) , johnson magnitudes from mermilliod ( 1991 ; transformed to flux using the calibration of colina et al .  1996 ) , 2mass magnitudes ( skrutskie et al .  2006 ; transformed to flux according to the calibration of cohen et al .",
    "2003 ) , and an akari 9  @xmath15 m measurement ( ishihara et al .",
    "the sed ( fig .",
    "3 ) indicates that there is a strong ir - excess from the be star s disk that extends into the optical range . in order to fit the photosphere of the star alone ,",
    "we restricted the range to the uv fluxes and @xmath43-band revised flux without the disk contribution ( the lower point plotted at 4443   in fig .",
    "we adopted a theoretical flux spectrum from the models of r.  l.   kurucz for solar metallicity , @xmath24 and @xmath27 from table  1 , and a microturbulent velocity of 2 km  s@xmath12 .",
    "this flux spectrum was fit to the restricted set of observations with two parameters : the limb - darkened , angular diameter @xmath44 and the reddening @xmath45 ( assuming a ratio of total - to - selective extinction @xmath46 and the reddening law from fitzpatrick 1999 ) .",
    "the observed and model emitted fluxes are related by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the wavelength dependent extinction ( fitzpatrick 1999 ) .",
    "the first parameter @xmath44 acts as a normalizing factor while @xmath45 defines how the shape of the sed is altered by the extinction @xmath48 .",
    "the results for these two fitting parameters are given in table  1 , and the derived @xmath49 spectrum is plotted as a solid line in figure  3 .",
    "we find a very low reddening along this line of sight , @xmath50 mag .",
    "earlier estimates consistently arrive at a higher reddening of @xmath51 mag ( snow et al .  1977 ; neckel & klare 1980 ; hernndez et al .  2005 ; zhang et al .",
    "2005 ) , but all of these estimates are based upon the @xmath52 color and ignore the disk contribution in the optical that makes the star appear too red ( fig .  3 ) .    combining the sed - derived angular size @xmath44 with the evolutionary radius @xmath53 yields a large distance , @xmath54  kpc , which places the star far beyond the nearby lac  ob1 association ( harris 1955 )",
    "at this distance , hd  215227 resides well below the galactic plane at @xmath55  kpc .",
    "this is an extreme distance for a normal ob star .",
    "for example , in the be star kinematical survey by berger & gies ( 2001 ) , the mean distance is @xmath56  pc and only one other star ( hd  20340 at @xmath57  kpc ) out of a sample of 344 has a distance from the plane as large as that of hd  215227 .",
    "this suggests that hd  215227 is a runaway star that probably obtained its initial high velocity and current position by a supernova explosion in a binary .",
    "we adopted the proper motions from van leeuwen ( 2007 ) and the average radial velocity and distance from table  1 to estimate the star s current peculiar values of tangential @xmath58 , radial @xmath59 , and space velocity @xmath60 using the method described by berger & gies ( 2001 ) .",
    "these peculiar velocities are measured relative to the star s local standard of rest by accounting for the sun s motion in the galaxy and differential galactic rotation .",
    "our estimates of the peculiar velocities ( table 1 ) are not unusually large , but the errors are significant and the star may have decelerated in the gravitational potential of the galaxy .",
    "the similarity of this be binary to other gamma - ray binaries , its probable runaway status , and its close proximity to the gamma - ray source location all indicate that hd  215227 may be the optical counterpart of agl  j2241 + 4454 .",
    "we encourage additional spectroscopic observations to search for orbital motion and to document the emission line variability around the orbit .",
    "new x - ray and radio observations with good angular resolution will be essential to secure the identification of the target ( see the case of hess  j0632 + 057 ; hinton et al .",
    "2009 ; skilton et al .",
    "furthermore , a search for periodic gamma - ray brightening on the 60  d cycle would offer conclusive evidence of the connection with the be star . if the orbital eccentricity is high , the gamma - ray emission may be restricted to a limited part of the orbit .",
    "we thank dr .",
    "dmitry monin and the other staff of the dominion astrophysical observatory , herzberg institute of astrophysics , national research council of canada , for their assistance in making these observations possible .",
