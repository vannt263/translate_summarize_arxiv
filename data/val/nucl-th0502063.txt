    "in contrast to the well - understood behavior near the valley of stability , there are many open questions as we move towards the neutron dripline . in this exotic region of the nuclear chart ,",
    "one expects to see several new phenomena @xcite : the neutron - matter distribution is very diffuse giving rise to the `` neutron skins '' and the `` neutron halos '' .",
    "one also expects new collective modes associated with the neutron skin , e.g. the `` scissors '' vibrational mode .    in current experiments ,",
    "the neutron dripline has only been reached for relatively light nuclei .",
    "the second - generation radioactive ion beam ( rib ) facilities currently under construction will allow us to explore nuclear structure and astrophysics at the driplines of heavier nuclei .",
    "it is generally acknowledged that an accurate theoretical treatment of the pairing interaction is essential for a description of the exotic nuclei @xcite . besides large pairing correlations",
    ", the hfb calculations have to face the problem of an accurate description of the continuum states with a large spatial extent .",
    "all of these features represent major challenges for the numerical solution .",
    "there are various mean - field methods of solving the non - relativistic hfb equations .",
    "generally , they can be divided into two categories : lattice methods and basis expansion methods . in the lattice approach no region of the spatial lattice",
    "is favored over any other region : the well bound , weakly bound and ( discretized ) continuum states can be represented with the same accuracy .",
    "currently , there are only two codes which solve the hfb problem on a lattice in coordinate space without any approximations using the quasiparticles : a 1-d ( spherical ) hfb code @xcite and the present 2-d ( axially symmetric ) code @xcite . in the basis expansion method a wave function is expanded into the chosen basis functions : the harmonic oscillator basis ( ho ) @xcite , the transformed harmonic oscillator basis ( tho ) @xcite , the hf orbitals @xcite .",
    "there is also an alternative method that is under development where the hfb equations are solved in the 3-d cartesian mesh using the canonical - basis approach @xcite .",
    "we solve the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) equations for deformed , axially symmetric nuclei in coordinate space on a 2-d lattice @xcite .",
    "our computational technique ( the basis - spline collocation and galerkin method ) is particularly well suited to study the ground state properties of nuclei near the driplines .",
    "it allows us to take into account high - energy continuum states up to an equivalent single - particle energy of 60 mev or more .    in this paper",
    "we study the ground state properties of neutron - rich zirconium nuclei ( @xmath2 ) up to the two - neutron dripline .",
    "the isotope chain calculations start from the @xmath3zr isotope up to the dripline nucleus , which turns out to be @xmath4zr . for a long time",
    ", the @xmath5 region has been of interest to nuclear structure physicists as an area of competition between various coexisting nuclear shapes ( well - deformed prolate , oblate , or spherical ) @xcite .",
    "the zirconium isotopes are known to possess a rapidly changing nuclear shape when the neutron number changes from 56 to 60 @xcite .",
    "we find that a spherical ground state shape is preferred over a prolate shape starting from the @xmath6zr isotope up to the dripline nucleus @xmath4zr . in this paper , we compare basis - spline lattice results with the hfb-2d - tho code @xcite , which uses a transformed harmonic oscillator basis ( tho ) , as well as with currently available experimental data .",
    "a detailed description of the basis - spline lattice method has been published in references @xcite ; we give here only a brief summary .",
    "in coordinate space representation , the hfb hamiltonian and the quasiparticle wavefunctions depend on the distance vector @xmath7 , spin projection @xmath8 , and isospin projection @xmath9 ( corresponding to protons and neutrons , respectively ) . in the hfb formalism , there are two types of quasiparticle ( bi - spinor ) wavefunctions , @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in the present work ,",
    "we utilize a skyrme effective n - n interaction in the particle - hole channel while the @xmath12 and @xmath13 channels are described by a zero - range delta pairing force . for these types of effective interactions , the particle mean field hamiltonian @xmath14 and the pairing field",
    "hamiltonian @xmath15 are diagonal in isospin space and local in position space , and the hfb equations have the following structure @xcite : @xmath16 where the lagrange parameter @xmath17 is introduced to yield the correct particle - number on average since the hfb wavefunction does not have a well defined particle - number .",
    "the quasiparticle energy spectrum is discrete for @xmath18 and continuous for @xmath19 @xcite . for even - even nuclei",
    "it is customary to solve the hfb equations for positive quasiparticle energies and consider all negative energy states as occupied in the hfb ground state .",
    "the quasiparticle wavefunctions determine the normal density @xmath20 and the pairing density @xmath21 as follows @xmath22    restricting ourselves to axially symmetric nuclei , we use cylindrical coordinates @xmath23 . in the hfb lattice method , we introduce a 2-d grid @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in radial direction ,",
    "the grid spans the region from @xmath27 to @xmath28 . because we want to be able to treat octupole shapes , we do not assume left - right symmetry in @xmath29-direction .",
    "consequently , the grid extends from @xmath30 to @xmath31 .",
    "typically , @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 .",
    "the hfb wavefunctions and operators are represented on the 2-d lattice by basis - spline expansion techniques . in practice ,",
    "b - splines of order m=9 are being used .",
    "details about the b - spline collocation and galerkin methods are given in the appendix .",
    "this section describes the numerical results for the even - even members of the zirconium ( @xmath2 ) isotope chain up to the two - neutron dripline .",
    "two theoretical approaches are presented and compared : a ) a 2-d lattice method using b - spline technology ( hereafter referred to as hfb-2d - lattice ) , and b ) an expansion in a 2-d harmonic oscillator ( hfb-2d - ho ) and transformed harmonic oscillator basis ( hfb-2d - tho ) .",
    "we also compare theoretical results with experimental data whenever possible .    in all calculations we utilize the sly4 skyrme force @xcite and a zero - range pairing force with a strength parameter @xmath36 ( hfb-2d - lattice code ) and an equivalent single particle energy cutoff parameter of @xmath37 mev .",
    "the pairing strength v@xmath38 has been adjusted in both codes to reproduce the measured average neutron paring gap of @xmath39 mev in @xmath40sn @xcite , as can be seen from table [ table : sn120 ] .",

    "all observables agree very well .",
    "the apparent `` disagreement '' in the proton fermi level @xmath47 is really an artifact : the pairing gap vanishes at the magic proton number @xmath48 resulting in an ill - defined fermi energy .",
    "the two codes use different prescriptions for calculating @xmath47 in the trivial case of no pairing .",
    "hfb+tho accepts the last occupied equivalent single - particle energy as @xmath47 in this no pairing case , whereas the basis - spline code takes the average of the last occupied and first unoccupied equivalent single - particle energy levels .",
    "recently , triple - gamma coincidence experiments have been carried out with gammasphere at lbnl @xcite which have determined half - lives and quadrupole deformations of the neutron - rich @xmath49 isotopes .",
    "the isotopes from that region are produced in the process of fission of transuranic elements and have been studied via @xmath50-ray spectroscopy techniques .",
    "these medium - mass nuclei are among the most neutron - rich isotopes ( @xmath51 ) for which spectroscopic data are available .",
    "very large prolate quadrupole deformations ( @xmath52 ) are found for the @xmath53zr isotopes .",
    "furthermore , the laser spectroscopy measurements @xcite for the zirconium isotopes have yielded precise rms - radii in this region .",
    "recently , an experiment has been carried out to measure the mass of the @xmath54zr isotope @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of a great interest to compare these data with the predictions of the self - consistent hfb mean field theory .    in radial ( @xmath55 ) direction ,",

    "the deformations ( for neutrons ) in terms of the deformation parameter @xmath64 for those nuclei , namely for the @xmath65zr isotopes range from @xmath64=0.42 to @xmath66 .",
    "both the basis - spline lattice code and the hfb-2d - tho code predict the @xmath67zr isotope to have the largest ground state deformation . for mass numbers larger than 112 , we observe spherical ground state shapes .",
    "experimental deformations for protons are available for two isotopes , @xmath3zr and @xmath54zr @xcite .",

    "only one experimental data point is available , the proton rms radius of @xmath3zr @xcite .",
    "the experiment yields a proton rms radius of 4.54  fm while the hfb codes predict a value of 4.45  fm ( hfb-2d - lattice ) and 4.46  fm ( hfb-2d - tho ) .",
    "the difference between theory and experiment is quite small , of order 2@xmath70 .",
    "we can clearly observe the presence of the neutron - skin manifested by the large differences between the neutron and proton rms radii for all of the isotopes in the chain .",
    "as expected the neutron - skin becomes `` thicker '' as we approach the dripline .",

    ", we find an enhancement in the neutron density with a shape that resembles the figure `` eight '' . in comparing the neutron to the proton density ,",

    "this quantity describes the probability of correlated nucleon pair formation with opposite spin projection , and it determines the pair transfer formfactor .",
    "we can see that most correlated pair formation takes place in the four closed shaped structured areas near the z - axis .",
    "we may conclude that neutrons dominate the pairing properties in the interior of this nucleus .",
    "the same applies to normal densities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] ) , yet the difference between neutrons and protons is more pronounced in case of the pairing densities .",
