    "the presence of a pseudo - magnetic field is observed via broad landau levels ( lls ) in strained graphene nanobubbles on a metal substrate @xcite .",
    "in addition to the pseudo - magnetic vector potential @xmath0 , strain also induces a scalar deformation potential @xmath1 @xcite that affects the electron dynamics in complex ways .",
    "the theoretical formalism has been laid out within the context of first - order continuum elasticity @xcite .",
    "it is possible to improve the theory from a mechanical perspective .",
    "such a development , provided on the present manuscript , improves our physical understanding of the inter - relation between mechanics and the electrons in graphene .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is twofold : first we motivate , build , and validate a novel framework to lay out a theory valid beyond first - order continuum mechanics .",
    "this novel formulation brings to the spotlight some of the inherent assumptions of the prevailing theoretical framework ; assumptions that have remained to some extent hidden within the continuum formalism .",
    "we disclose upfront that the formalism does not take into account the effects of curvature within the framework of refs .  ; we will address such shortcoming in the near future .",
    "nevertheless , the reader will realize that the inherent formulation of the theory on the present paper remains novel , bringing a deeper understanding of the formalism for studying the effects of mechanical strain on the electronic properties of graphene .",
    "following recent experimental developments in which graphene membranes are studied with local scanning tunneling microscopy probes @xcite , our second goal is to demonstrate this novel formalism on freestanding graphene membranes under load by a sharp tip .",
    "the input for this formalism is direct ` raw ' atomic displacements upon strain , as opposed to the always present continuum deformation field @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the presentation is given in modular and self - contained form .",
    "hence , discussion of the formalism is given first , then the pure mechanics of freestanding membranes is presented , and predictions from the formalism as pertains to freestanding membranes follows .",
    "this helps in focusing either on the basic formulation , or on the predictions from this theory on a experimentally - relevant system .",
    "conclusions are given at the end of the manuscript .",
    "in order to motivate the developments presented here , we express in an explicit form the underlying assumptions of the theory , which can be found as opening statements in ref .  : `` _ if _ a mechanical strain varies smoothly on the scale of interatomic distances , it does not break sublattice symmetry but rather deforms the brillouin zone in such a way that the dirac cones located in graphene at points @xmath3 and @xmath4 are shifted in opposite directions . ''",
    "( see also ref .  .",
    ")    previous statement tells us that provided strain preserves sublattice symmetry one can understand the effects of mechanical strain on the electronic structure in terms of a semiclassical approach , as follows : the local strain - induced fields @xmath5 and @xmath6 are incorporated into a spatially - varying pseudospin hamiltonian @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the low - energy expansion of the hamiltonian in reciprocal space in the absence of strain .",
    "we will mention a number of times that the semiclassical approximation is justified _ if _ the strain is slowly varying , that is , when it extends over many unit cells @xcite and preserves sublattice symmetry @xcite .",
    "evidently , it is also possible to determine the electronic properties directly from a tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath9 in real space , without resorting to the semiclassical approximation and without imposing an a priori lattice symmetry .",
    "that is , while the semiclassical @xmath7 is defined in reciprocal space ( thus assuming some reasonable preservation of crystalline order ) , the tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath9 in real space is more general and can be used for membranes with arbitrary spatial distribution and magnitude of the strain .",
    "constituting one of the main arguments of the present paper , we show how to determine if mechanical distortions preserve the fundamental sublattice symmetry .",
    "we do this by computing , at each unit cell , angular @xmath10 and length changes @xmath11 from the adequate nearest - neighbor vectors .",
    "such measures will become relevant for the strongly inhomogeneous strain created by local probes @xcite , and will give a quantitative meaning for the first time to statements such as `` long - range mechanical distortion@xcite '' and `` mechanical distortions preserving sublattice symmetry @xcite . ''",
    "the program comes down to re - expressing the theory beyond continuum elasticity and explicitly on the atomic lattice , such that matters of spatial scale can be analyzed . for clarity",
    "we say that as a matter of definition there is no explicit information of interatomic distances on a continuum media , so sublattice symmetry can not be determined on this formulation of the theory .    indeed , in the only known formulation of the theory ( commonly referred to as the _ lattice _ , or",
    "_ tight - binding _ approach ) , both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are expressed in terms of a _ continuous _ displacement field @xmath2 obtained within first - order continuum elasticity ( ce ) @xcite .",
    "it is not possible to assess sublattice symmetry on a continuum media , and therefore proper phase conjugation of pseudospin hamiltonians becomes an implicit assumption of the theory .",
    "continuum elasticity is based on the fundamental assumption , known as cauchy - born rule ( cbr ) , that deformations around any material point are homogeneous .",
    "but cbr does not hold exactly on the honeycomb lattice , nor under central load or rippling @xcite .    as an additional contribution on the present paper that adds physical value to our formulation , we mention that an argument was made in the recent past for the inclusion of additional k - point dependent terms to pseudo - magnetic fields @xcite . working directly on the atomic lattice ,",
    "it is easy to show that such terms vanish to first order .",
    "we will also show how the formalism based on ce @xcite becomes a limiting case of the one presented here , when the distortion at all unit cells is small in comparison to the lattice constant @xmath12 .",

    "this finite number of pseudospinor hamiltonians that can be defined on a membrane with @xmath24 atoms represents the first departure of our formulation of the theory when compared with the formalism developed on a continuum media : in the continuum approach @xcite , the two degrees of freedom of a given local pseudospin hamiltonian @xmath7 should correspond to those of an underlying unit cell with two atoms . however , the pseudospin hamiltonian is defined as a continuous function of coordinates @xmath25 and is hence detached from the actual spatial structure of the lattice .",
