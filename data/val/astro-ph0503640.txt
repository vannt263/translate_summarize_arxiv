    "the near - infrared cluster luminosity function is an important diagnostic tool for understanding the evolution of cluster galaxies . using ground - based k - band data and a sample of 38 clusters , de propris et al .",

    "( 2004 ) showed that the faint end slope of the lf was shallower at higher redshifts .",
    "our 3.6@xmath0 lfs confirm both of these results .",
    "we constructed lfs for our sample by stacking clusters in redshift intervals of @xmath5 .",
    "we measure number counts from the full 4 degree@xmath1 of the fls and use them to statistically subtract the background . in order to stack clusters",
    "we artificially redshift each cluster to the median redshift of the bin .",
    "this involves computing the offset distance modulus as well as a small k - correction .",
    "we use all galaxies within a radius of 750 mpc to construct the lfs , and apply a small completeness correction calculated from lacy et al .",
    "the result is 10 lfs which span the redshift range 0.15 @xmath6 1.22 , and contain 7 - 21 clusters per bin .",
    "figure 1 shows the _ z _ = 0.15 , 0.56 , 0.83 , & 1.00 lfs .",
    "the fls data is fairly shallow ( @xmath4 m@xmath2 + 1.5 at _ z _ = 1.0 ) , and it does not allow a robust fit of the faint - end slope ( @xmath7 ) of the lfs .",
    "therefore , we chose to hold @xmath7 constant ( adopting @xmath8 , the value assumed by de propris et al .",
    "we fit only the normalization ( @xmath9 ) and characteristic magnitude ( m@xmath2 ) . at _ z _ @xmath10 0.5 , the lfs are well fit ( reduced @xmath11 @xmath4 1 ) .",
    "however at _ z _ @xmath3 0.5 the fits become much poorer . in an attempt to improve the fit we allowed @xmath7 to vary in value from -0.2 to -1.5 , in increments of 0.1 .",
    "we found that @xmath7 = -0.5 at @xmath12 , provided the best fit ( mean reduced @xmath11 of 0.83 compared to 1.1 for @xmath7 = -0.9 ) .",
    "this faint - end slope is consistent with the value of @xmath7 = -0.64 found by toft et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and indicates that the number of low - mass galaxies in clusters decreases with redshift .",
    "furthermore , our fitted values of m@xmath2 are consistent with models of passively evolving galaxies that form the bulk of their stars in a single - burst at _ z _ @xmath3 2 .",
    "our interpretation of these results is that the most massive galaxies in clusters form synchronously with the cluster at _ z _ @xmath3 2 , whereas many of the low - mass systems are accreted from the field at lower redshift ( _ z _ @xmath10 0.5 ) ."
