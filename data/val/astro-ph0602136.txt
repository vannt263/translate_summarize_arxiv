    "in addition , in november 2005 , we used the tophat telescope of the hat network at the fred lawrence whipple observatory ( flwo ) , to obtain i - band images .",
    "we also acquired 8 short exposure i - band frames in december 2005 with keplercam on the 1.2 m telescope at flwo .",
    "we used our home - grown  software environment ( pl et al .",
    "2006 , in preparation ) to find sources on all the above images ( @xmath1350 isolated , non - saturated stars ) , cross - match them by rejecting outliers , determine the astrometric mapping between the images , and transform them to the same reference system . visual inspection of the registered frames show i ) the prominent southward proper motion of  ( in harmony with the hipparcos values ) , ii ) a much fainter co - moving companion that we identify as  ( for details , see fig .",

    "the companion is clearly separated from  on the 2mass j , h and k scans ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hd189mon ] , right panel ) , and is listed in the 2mass point source catalogue as . although not illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : hd189mon ] , the co - movement is also demonstrated by the tophat and flwo 1.2 m i - band frames .",
    "no other co - moving companion is detected on these frames .    to quantify the proper motion of , we have carried out astrometry on the quickv , poss - ii , 2mass , tophat and flwo1.2 m observations .",
    "we used the 2mass catalogue as astrometric reference , where the quoted position uncertainty of bright , isolated sources is 120mas .",
    "we used the previously established pixel centers of @xmath14 un - saturated stars that we found by fitting gaussian profiles . by running our /  star - finder algorithm on artificially generated frames , we found typical errors of the centroid positions to be on the order of 0.05pix ( corresponding to 0.08  on quickv , 0.05  on poss - ii and 2mass , and 0.1  on tophat and 0.07  on flwo1.2 m ) .",
    "we then derived the second order astrometric mappings between the x , y coordinates and the 2mass astrometric reference ( ( b ) were omitted from the fit ) , and used this to transform the pixel coordinates of the frames to the icrs ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ; * ? ? ?",

    "therefore , it is clear that , within uncertainties ,  and  share a common proper motion and so are likely to comprise a bound system .      a common radial velocity is a further indication that the two stars are physically associated . in order to test this possibility",
    ", we obtained spectroscopic observations of both the primary star and the suspected companion , using the center for astrophysics ( cfa ) digital speedometer ( ds ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at the 1.5 m tillinghast telescope of flwo , arizona .",
    "seven ds observations have been made of the star dating back to 1995 , with the two most recent being 2005 dec 10 and dec 17 .",
    "for each of these a radial velocity was obtained on the cfa native system velocity reference @xcite .",
    "the mean and standard deviation of these measurements is @xmath25 = @xmath26 @xmath27 , with no significant evidence for a long - term velocity variation over the past 10 years . for",
    ", two ds observations were made , on 2005 dec 10 and 17 , yielding a mean radial velocity @xmath28 @xmath27 .",
    "thus , within observational uncertainties the difference in measured velocities is consistent with the two stars being physical companions .",
    "there is still a remote chance that the apparent companion could be a distant giant star with high tangential velocity or a very close - by low luminosity and velocity sub - dwarf , that happens to have the same sky position , radial velocity , and proper motion .",
    "while the ds has the primary goal of radial - velocity measurements , correlation of the spectrum with template spectra based on the @xcite models also yields information on @xmath29 , @xmath30  and stellar rotation @xmath31 .",
    "we obtained @xmath32  a value appropriate to a main sequence m dwarf .",
    "correlation with observed spectra of m dwarfs with spectral type ranging from m0.0 to m5.5 gives best correlation near m3.5 .",
    "we also observed  with the fast spectrograph on the flwo 1.5 m telescope .",
    "visual comparison of the resulting spectra to known m dwarf spectra suggests a spectral type of m4v . based on its spectral type , plus",
    "apparent magnitude , we then infer a distance to  consistent with the 19.3 pc distance to  .",
    "we independently estimated the spectral type of  from 2mass photometry . because of the slightly overlapping profile of the close - by , bright we performed aperture photometry of  on the 1999 2mass scans after subtracting off the gaussian profile of , and using @xmath14 isolated stars with original 2mass photometry as reference .",
    "this analysis yields @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "these values are within @xmath36mag of the 2mass point source catalogue values , but we find smaller errors , and slightly redder @xmath37 color index .",
    "we transformed our measured @xmath38 value ( namely @xmath39 ) , to @xmath37 on the bessell and brett ( bb ) system following @xcite , to obtain @xmath40 .",
    "then we derived the absolute magnitude @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) from our measured h magnitude and an assumed distance equal to that of and plotted these values on the color - magnitude diagram of @xcite , which also plots a 5-gyr isochrone from @xcite .",
    "the position on the color magnitude diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : iso ] ) corresponds to a stellar mass of 0.175 to 0.2@xmath43 , which according to @xcite corresponds to an m dwarf with spectral type of about m5 .",
    "the good fit to the isochrone supports our assumption that the distance to  is similar to that to .    from the above analyses we conclude that  is an m dwarf with spectral type in the range m3.5 to m5 , with common proper motion , radial velocity , and distance to .",
    "the relative positions ( from astrometry , and assuming equidistance ) , and relative velocities of the two stars ( from proper motion and radial velocity data ) , along with the 1@xmath43  total system mass , are consistent within 2@xmath44 with the system being gravitationally bound .",
    "although it would formally be possible for an interloper m dwarf star to be passing very close to  at the current epoch , with a relative speed so small as to make it almost gravitationally bound , this possibility is so remote that we conclude that the two stars do indeed form a bound system with projected separation about 216 au .",
    "if the true separation of  and  is close to the projected separation , and the orbit is circular , and the total system mass is @xmath131@xmath43  ( 0.82@xmath43  for  from and 0.2@xmath43  for  from  [ sec : char ] ) then the orbital period is @xmath133200 years , corresponding to @xmath132@xmath27  orbital motion . for a face on orbit",
    "this would yield an observable @xmath45 @xmath11   differential proper motion in addition to the co - movement .    in an attempt to detect this , we used two pairs of 2mass images in the h and k bands obtained in 1999 and 2000 ( one of these is the right - hand image in fig .  [",
    "fig : hd189mon ] ) , with mean epoch 2000.073 , and compared them with the 8 high resolution i - band frames of the field taken with the flwo 1.2 m telescope at epoch 2005.970 .",
    "we note that although the other data were useful in confirmation of the common proper motion ( as shown in ",
    "[ sec : comprop ] ) , because of the saturated  image ( poss , quick - v ) and low s / n ( tophat ) they were not used in this precise astrometry aimed at refining the differential proper motion .",
    "the astrometry of  over the 5.897 year baseline yields a proper motion of @xmath46 @xmath11  and @xmath47 @xmath11 . because this agrees with the more precise hipparcos value within uncertainties (  [ sec : comprop ] )",
    ", we adopt that value for the proper motion of . for",
    "we find @xmath48 @xmath11  and @xmath49 @xmath11 , which imply a differential proper motion relative to  of @xmath50 @xmath11  and @xmath51 @xmath11(fig .",
    "[ fig : diffppm ] ) .",
    "formally , the data indicate a detection of relative proper motion at the 4@xmath44 level . the position of the companion , and its direction and magnitude of relative motion , are consistent with orbital motion in a clockwise orbit roughly in the plane of the sky .    however , there could be underlying systematic effects due to the different instruments and bandpasses used for the earlier - epoch 2mass data and the later - epoch flwo1.2 data .",
    "we estimated one of these , namely the effect of stellar profile merging of  with  that is different on the 2mass and flwo1.2 m frames . by subtracting off the gaussian profile of the primary , we found that the derived proper motion of  changed by only 2@xmath11 . nevertheless , while the detection of orbital motion roughly in the plane of the sky seems secure , it is premature to derive specific orbital parameters for the system",
    "several studies have been done on the characteristics of close - in planets orbiting the primary star of a multiple star system .",
    "thus ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) found a tendency for massive planets ( @xmath2  greater than 2@xmath52 ) to occur preferentially in multiple - star systems .",
    "however ,  is a low - mass planet ( 1.15@xmath52without @xmath53 ambiguity ) , and yet it is in a multiple stellar system , thus weakening the distinction between single and multiple stars .",
    "exceeds all other known extrasolar planets in binary systems in its proximity to its parent star ( @xmath54=0.031 au ) .",
    "however , a number of planets in multiple - star systems are nearly as close ( e.g.  tau boo b , @xmath54=0.05 au ; hd 75289b , @xmath54=0.046 au ) .",
    "the data suggest ( see  [ sec : orb ] ) that the binary orbit is likely to be nearly face on , i.e.  the orbital plane would be nearly orthogonal to the orbital plane of the planet , which by virtue of its transit we know to have an inclination of nearly @xmath55 .",
    "a detailed calculation based on the relative velocities and positions of the two stars shows that the orbit of  and  can not be coplanar at the 4-@xmath44 level ( pl et al , in preparation ) .",
    "when additional transiting planets are discovered in multiple star systems , it should be possible to study the relation of the system architecture ( e.g.  mass , semi - major axis of the stellar secondary ) to planet properties in better detail .",
    "because the  system is so close - by , it should be possible to do excellent astrometry over the next few years with modern high precision astrometric techniques from ground or space . the changing radial velocity signal of either or both of  and  might also be detectable after a few years of monitoring with current high - precision radial velocity devices .",
    "high precision proper motion and radial velocity measurements should lead to a good characterization of the orbital characteristics of the binary system and their relation to the orbit of the transiting planet .    finally , we note that because this system is only 19 pc from earth and hence both stellar components are unusually bright for their spectral types , many additional follow - on observations requiring high resolution spectroscopy or high precision photometry will be feasible . this should permit a full characterization of the system including the possible detection of additional low mass components .",
