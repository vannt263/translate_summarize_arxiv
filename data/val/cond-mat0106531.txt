    "the famous effect predicted by aharonov and bohm ( * ab * ) in 1959 @xcite concerns the essential influence of a vector potential on the interference pattern of two beams of electrons confined in multiply connected paths , over which the magnetic field is zero .",
    "it is manifested by the periodic oscillation of the conductance of a ring or a cylinder as a function of the enclosed magnetic flux @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the * ab * effect also exists in some singly connected geometry such as a point contact or a disk shape in a two - dimensional electron gas , in which circulating edge states enclose a well - defined magnetic flux @xcite .",
    "a significant hallmark in mesoscopic experiments is the phase measurements of the transmission amplitude through a quantum dot embedded in an * ab * ring in the coulomb blockade regime @xcite .",
    "it revived interest on the * ab * effect in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "quantum dots are highly tunable artificial mesoscopic structures @xcite , usually called artificial atoms or artificial molecules . some novel physical properties , such as the coulomb blockade and the turnstile effect ,",
    "have been demonstrated in some elegant experiments @xcite . at low temperatures , transport through a single quantum dot",
    "is dominated by resonant tunneling and coulomb blockade .",
    "when the condition for resonant tunneling is not accessible , co - tunneling events involving the simultaneous tunneling of two or more electrons through a virtual intermediate level can be dominant @xcite . when quantum dots are connected in series with tunneling barrier(s ) , it is expected that the coupling between dots plays a crucial role in the transport properties of the coupled structure . on the other hand",
    ", electron tunneling through the coupled dot system is very sensitive to the incoherent scattering , which has trivial effects on the transport properties of a single dot @xcite . in the past decade , transport through coupled quantum dot systems has received considerable amount of attention @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate coherent electronic transport through four coupled quantum dots located at the four corners of a square enclosing a magnetic flux .",
    "this kind of coupled dot structure is the basic unit of two - dimensional quantum dot arrays .",
    "our goal is to find out how the conductance of such a structure depends on the coupling strength between dots , the arrangement of dot levels and the magnetic flux . in the present work",
    ", we do not take into consideration the interdot and intradot electron - electron interactions .",
    "we also assume that just one level is relevant on each dot .",
    "this allows us , on the one hand , to obtain some exact analytical results .",
    "on the other hand , we can gain much more clear physical insight into the dependence of the conductance of the system on the structure parameters ( interdot couplings and dot levels ) and the magnetic flux . though the model we consider is simple ,",
    "some novel and interesting results are obtained arising from the interplay of the specific configuration of dot levels and interdot couplings , and the magnetic flux .",

    "it is well known that the two - terminal conductance of an @xmath76 ring is a periodic even function of the enclosed magnetic flux @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the oscillation of the conductance , with periodicity @xmath77 , results from the quantum interference between the paths located in the upper and lower arms of the ring . for electron tunneling through a single dot , the conductance peak reaches its maximum when @xmath78 . in the coupled double quantum dot structure with aligned energy levels ,",
    "the conductance peak reach a maximum value and splits into a double peak with peak separation @xmath79 when the interdot coupling @xmath80 becomes larger than the width of the peak @xmath81 in the symmetric dot - lead coupling case@xcite . for the three coupled dot string , the situation is more complicated , though the condition for maximum conductance peak is the simple eq .",
    "( 23 ) since the levels of the dots are aligned .",
    "we expect that the conductance peak will split into three maxima when the interdot coupling becomes larger than the width of the peak , as in the double dot case .    for further comparison ,",
    "we first calculate the linear conductance of the quantum dot array in the absence of the magnetic flux @xmath1 and in the symmetric dot - lead coupling case ( @xmath78 ) . throughout this paper , energy and coupling strengths",

    "the results for aligned levels and various kinds of interdot coupling configurations are shown in fig .",
    "2 ( a ) , while fig .",
    "2 ( b , c ) are for different arrangements of the dot levels . when the four dot levels are aligned , three conductance peaks appear if @xmath83 and @xmath84",
    ". then the conductance possesses the same three resonant peak structure as the three dot string .",
    "one can also find that the criteria for complete resonant transmission for the three - dot systems manifests itself in our four dot structure .",
    "this is not strange since the conductance in our case is simply the superposition of the contributions from the upper and lower three - dot arms .",
    "when @xmath85 , the situation becomes different . in this case , one can consider the dot structure as a system of two coupled quantum dot dimers .",
    "one observes in the conductance spectra four peaks , arranged in two groups separated by a conductance gap .",
    "the separation between the two group centers is mainly determined by the larger interdot coupling , and the peak separation of each group by the smaller one .",
    "the peak and group center separations have trivial dependence on the dot - lead couplings @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the coupled quantum dimers case .",
    "the conductance gap is introduced by the larger coupling strength between the two dimers and can not be lifted by a magnetic flux , contrary to the case of the fano conductance dip discussed below .",
    "the gap can be broadened by increasing the coupling strength(s ) @xmath86 ( and/or @xmath87 ) between the two dimers .",
    "figures 2 ( b , c ) , displaying cases of mismatched levels , show more interesting conductance spectra .",

    "when @xmath91 the conductance dip is pinned at the energy level of the quantum dot with small couplings to the system ( solid line in fig .",
    "2 ( b ) ) . the middle peak appears split into two asymmetric peaks .",
    "the asymmetry between the two split peaks depends on the mismatch between the energy levels of dots 2 and 3 , as well as the arrangement of the levels of other dots 1 and 4 .",
    "novel five spikes ( the dashed line in fig .",
    "2 ( b ) ) in the conductance can be seen if the mismatch between the levels of dot 2 and 3 is large enough .",
    "the dip results from a fano interference@xcite between two distinct current paths , one being direct nonresonant and the other nondirect resonant@xcite .",
    "the conductance can be generally written@xcite as @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the nonresonant conductance , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 is the fano parameter assessing the asymmetry of the lineshape .",
    "two limiting cases exist [ ref .",
    "17(b ) ] : ( a ) @xmath96 , with a dominating resonant transmission resulting in breit - wigner resonances and , ( b ) @xmath97 , with a dominating nonresonant transmission leading to asymmetric dips .",
    "since here @xmath88 , one can consider either the arm consisting of dot 2 or 3 as the resonant ( nonresonant ) path .",

    "it is evident that two resonance peaks exist when @xmath99 and @xmath100 , while @xmath101=0 when @xmath102 , which is just the position of the fano conductance dip . for large mismatch between energy levels of dots 2 and 3 , fano interference between the two paths develops both a conductance dip and a peak halfway between these levels @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "one can then observe a five peak structure in the conductance .",
    "when the levels of dots 2 and 3 are matched , the resonant peak structure of the dot systems behaves to a large extent the same way as the coupled three - dot system @xcite .",
    "now we turn to study the effect of the magnetic flux @xmath1 on the conductance spectra of our square dot system .",
    "figure 3 exhibits clearly the * ab * oscillations of the conductance as a function of the magnetic flux @xmath105 within a period at @xmath106 .",
    "when the two arms of the dot ring are symmetric , i.e. , the dot levels and interdot couplings are arranged to be the same , the conductance @xmath101 vanishes at @xmath107 ( fig .",
    "3(a ) and the solid line in fig .",
    "3(c ) ) . in the case of asymmetric arms ,",
    "the conductance is nonzero within the whole period .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath101 at @xmath107 results from the complete destructive interference between the two symmetric arms , which will be analyzed in more detail below .",
    "if the two arms are not symmetric , complete destructive interference is never achievable , and the conductance is always nonzero . the more asymmetry between the two arms , the larger the conductance near @xmath107 . to get a clearer insight into the influence of a magnetic flux on @xmath101 , we give in figs . 4 and 5 the conductance of the structure as a function of the fermi energy for different values of magnetic flux within half a period ( @xmath108 ) , and different configurations of interdot couplings and dot levels .",
    "the dependence of the conductance on the magnetic flux @xmath1 is apparent .",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath37 oscillation strongly depends on the matching condition of the dot levels and the configuration of the interdot couplings .",
    "it also differs for different pinning positions of the fermi energy at the leads .",
    "the presence of a magnetic flux can lead to the splitting ( fig .",
    "5(b ) ) and combination ( fig .",
    "4(c ) and figs .",
    "5 ( a , c , d ) ) of conductance peak(s ) since it changes the interference between the two current paths , as determined by term @xmath109 in eq .",
    "another striking effect induced by the magnetic flux is that the central conductance peak , if present ( fig .",
    "4 ) , becomes a conductance dip when the levels of dots @xmath66 and @xmath90 are aligned , while the fano - type dip appearing in the case of mismatched levels is lifted ( fig .",
    "5 ) , contrary to the usual conductance gap which survives in the presence of a magnetic flux ( fig .",
    "4 ( c ) ) .",
    "this feature is typically a result of the modified fano phase interference by the magnetic flux .",
    "when @xmath107 , the conductance is depressed everywhere if @xmath110 and @xmath111 , as shown in fig . 4 and fig . 5 ( b ) .",
    "the overall depression of the conductance results from the complete destructive interference between the upper - arm and lower - arm current paths .",
    "when @xmath112 and @xmath111 , one finds @xmath113 , which implies zero conductance for any value of the fermi energy if @xmath107 .",
    "we can also analyze it from the interference pattern of the two current paths containing either dot 2 or 3 .",
    "the respective transmission amplitudes @xmath114 and @xmath115 equal @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively , when @xmath118 and @xmath112 .",
    "then the total transmission probability @xmath119 for electron tunneling through the dot structure is proportional to @xmath120 , which is zero when @xmath107 .      in the preceding subsection",
    "we have reported in detail the linear conductance spectra in the absence and presence of a magnetic flux , in the limit of symmetric dot - lead couplings .",
    "there we saw symmetrically - located conductance peaks if the dot levels are aligned , which is a consequence of the particle - hole symmetry . in this subsection",
    ", we want to study how the conductance is modified if the dot - lead couplings are asymmetric .",
    "we model the asymmetry between the dot - lead coupling @xmath61 and @xmath121 by setting @xmath122 .",
    "figures 6 and 7 present the comparison of conductance spectra in the cases of symmetric ( thin lines ) and asymmetric ( thick lines ) dot - lead couplings , with structure parameters the same as in fig . 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "a surprising feature in these figures is that the asymmetry between dot - lead couplings can remove the symmetry of the conductance spectra around some energy when the energy levels of dots are not aligned ( figs .",
    "7 ( c , d ) ) , while it can not if they are aligned ( fig . 6 ) . also depending on the value of the magnetic flux @xmath105 , the conductance in the case of asymmetric dot - lead couplings is lifted ( figs .",
    "6 ( a , c ) , @xmath123 ) or suppressed ( figs . 6 ( a , c ) , @xmath124 and fig . 7 ( a ) @xmath125 ) , as compared to the symmetric case .",
    "we also observe another interesting phenomenon .",
    "the conductance changes in a nonuniform way when the dot - lead couplings become asymmetric .",
    "this is reflected in the observation that some conductance peaks are lifted while the others are suppressed ( fig .",
    "6 ( b ) and figs .",
    "7 ( c , d ) ) . in addition",
    ", we find that the asymmetric dot - lead couplings would introduce a splitting of the conductance peak ( fig . 6 ( b ) , figs . 7 ( c , d ) ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the position of the conductance peaks remain nearly unshifted when the dot - lead couplings become asymmetric .",
    "these features can be understood for linear conductance from the analysis of the generalized spectral function @xmath56 in equation ( 17 ) , which depends on the dot - lead couplings @xmath61 and @xmath62 . in the case of a single quantum dot",
    ", a difference in the value of the dot - lead couplings @xmath61 and @xmath62 does not change the position of the resonant transmission or conductance peak , but does alter its height . in our case , the dependence on @xmath61 and @xmath62 of the spectral function or conductance is much more complicated .",
    "however , it appears that a difference between @xmath61 and @xmath62 does also modify the weight of the peaks in the generalized spectral function @xmath56 in a complicated way dependent on the applied magnetic flux .",
    "the position of the conductance peaks is kept intact by the difference between @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "to sum up , we have investigated the transport properties in the linear regime , of a two - terminal quantum dot square enclosing a magnetic flux .",
    "although our results are not directly applicable to more complex arrays involving more conducting paths and dots , we believe that our study will provide insight into the physics of interference that such arrays will exhibit .",
    "our main results may be summarized as follows : ( 1 ) the @xmath37 oscillations of the conductance strongly depends on the configurations of dot levels and interdot and dot - lead couplings , along with the position of the fermi energy of the leads ; ( 2 ) a striking conductance dip is developed due to the fano interference when the levels of the intermediate dots are mismatched , and a novel five peak structure is observed for large mismatch ; ( 3 ) the magnetic flux and an asymmetric dot - lead coupling can induce the splitting and combination of the conductance peak(s ) ; ( 4 ) the interplay of a magnetic flux and asymmetry between dot - lead coupling can lead to interesting @xmath37 oscillations of the linear conductance .",
    "if the electron - electron interactions are taken into consideration , further structure in the conductance may be expected due to the presence of an additional energy scale .",
    "results in the regime in which such energy scale is relevant will be reported elsewhere .",
