    "in the last five years , more than a dozen ultra - faint milky way satellites have been discovered with one millionth of the milky way s luminosity or less .",
    "these objects have stars with [ fe / h ] at least as low as -3.0 , [ fe / h ] spreads of up to 1 dex @xcite , and velocity dispersions of @xmath3 km sec@xmath4 @xcite , and scale sizes of 30 - 200 pc @xcite .",
    "a common explanation for these observed properties thus far is that we are observing dwarf galaxy member stars moving on bound orbits within highly dark matter dominated potential wells . within this scenario ,",
    "the velocity dispersions of these objects have been interpreted to possibly imply mass - to - light ratios of @xmath5 within their central 300 pc @xcite and that galaxies can have total luminosities of only @xmath6 - far less than the luminosities of some individual stars .",
    "these remarkable conclusions should require a high burden of proof : are there any other plausible explanations for the ultra - faint milky way satellites as a population ?",
    "one possibility is that the ultra - faints could have intrinsic near - zero velocity dispersions ( and thus no dark matter ) , but that binary stars have inflated their observed dispersions . while this scenario could be conceivable for a small number of objects",
    ", it can not explain away the entire ultra - faint galaxy population @xcite .",
    "moreover , the low amount of and large spread in their iron abundances show that these objects can not have formed in the same way as globular clusters , ruling out ( disrupting ) globular cluster scenarios .",
    "the possible inflated ellipticities of ultra - faint dwarfs relative to their more luminous neighbors @xcite combined with claims of irregular isophotes tempts a conclusion that these are tidal remnants .",
    "however , claims of isophote irregularity have been inconclusive for the majority of ultra - faint satellites .",
    "recently , @xcite have found that the shape of the hercules dwarf might be explained by tidal disruption .",
    "a fourth possibility is that ( a subset of ) the kinematically cold , spatial overdensities that have been identified as ultra - faint galaxies are instead cusp caustics of cold stellar debris .",
    "cold substructures are both observed ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) and predicted to be abundant in the milky way s halo .",
    "shell - like structures can form during the disruption of a low mass satellite , as the satellite interacts with a massive galaxy , and have been seen in both simulations @xcite and observations @xcite of early - type galaxies .",
    "after an interaction creates such a sheet of stars , the sheet can evolve and fold in ways that produce visible fold caustics ( `` catastrophes '' ) , cusp caustics , and higher - order caustics in the observed two - dimensional distribution of stars @xcite .",
    "a cusp caustic in a two - dimensional observable space appears as a highly elliptical centroid of stars where two fold caustics meet , creating an asymmetrical flare - like feature . in this scenario ,",
    "some of the ultra - faint dwarfs may actually be cusps and some of the cold streams could be folds .    in this paper , we develop a technique for testing the hypothesis that ultra - faint dwarf galaxies are the 2-d projections of such folded stellar sheets .",
    "we apply this technique to the hercules milky way satellite , which has d @xmath0 113 kpc , @xmath7 -6.2 , and @xmath8 0.67 @xcite .",
    "we choose this object because it has the highest ellipticity of any of the milky way s dwarfs and is thus a good candidate for the cusp model .",
    "* hereafter c07 ) obtained large binocular telescope imaging of the hercules dwarf galaxy in the gunn @xmath9 band ( 25 minutes ) , @xmath10 band ( 20 minutes ) , and @xmath11 band ( 30 minutes ) to derive its structural parameters .",
    "the large binocular camera spans a 23@xmath12 x 23@xmath12 field of view .",
    "c07 applied color - color - magnitude filtering in colors @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( combinations of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ) to their point source catalog to select objects most consistent with belonging to hercules rather than to the field . in this paper",
    "we utilize the @xmath010,000 stars from the c07 cmd selected subset of their lbt / lbc hercules catalog .",
    "this catalog is identical to what they used to derive the structure of hercules .",
    "please see c07 for further details on this data set .",
    "we aim to determine whether a cusp model is a better explanation of the spatial distribution of the elongated hercules dwarf than a flattened exponential model . to perform this model comparison ,",
    "we specify each model explicitly , compute the poisson likelihood of the data given the models , and use the maximum likelihood of each model to determine which best fits the data .",
    "both of the exponential and cusp models tested here have six free parameters .",
    "the cusp model s free parameters are : central ra and dec , rotation angle and scale , a smoothing scale , and a constant background level .",
    "the exponential model s free parameters are : central ra and dec , a rotation angle , ellipticity , half - light radius , and a constant background level . for each model",
    "we step through the six parameters ( @xmath15 ) and evaluate the likelihood of the data given each model . the full likelihood , which is a product of the individual star likelihoods , is :    @xmath16    @xmath17    where @xmath15 is the list of parameters for the cusp or exponential model",
    ", @xmath18 is the surface density of the model given the parameters , and @xmath19 is a normalization constant , estimated using a spatially randomized stellar catalog over the observed sky region .",
    "@xmath20 is the total number of stars , and @xmath21 is the two - dimensional position ( on the sky ) of star @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is the total number of random points , set to equal @xmath20 , and @xmath24 is the position of random point @xmath25 .",
    "the cusp surface density model is computed following the work of @xcite .",
    "first , a background - free @xmath26 is computed on a grid in the natural coordinate system @xmath27 : @xmath28^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 in three dimensions , coordinates @xmath30 and @xmath31 make up the 2-d observable space , while coordinate y is the third , and hidden , dimension . as a third degree polynomial , equation ( 4 )",
    "has either one or three solutions , depending on the position in @xmath27 .",
    "equation ( 3 ) is to be summed over all the possible roots of variable y , obtained by solving equation ( 4 ) . in regions where there is no cusp",
    ", there will only be one solution to equation ( 4 ) , and hence no summation in the calculation of the surface density is necessary .",
    "on the other hand , in regions of @xmath27 where there is a cusp , the variable y will be triple valued , and equation ( 3 ) must be summed over all three roots .",
    "because this function has a large dynamic range , we compute it on a fine grid of @xmath32 pixels . even with such fine pixels , however , the value of the cusp function can vary significantly within a pixel in regions of the image where the cusp is present . at such pixels ,",
    "we evaluate the function ( equation 3 ) at multiple random locations within the pixel .",
    "this adaptive sampling sets the number of samples per pixel to a constant multiple ( 10 ) of the value of the function .",
    "this essentially ensures that we are sampling more in the most interesting regions of the image , where the cusp is present .",
    "@xmath26 has no free parameters in the natural coordinate system .",
    "after the cusp image has been computed on a grid , it is smoothed with a symmetric two - dimensional gaussian kernel with variance @xmath33 .",
    "we have computed seven cusp models , each with a different smoothing scale , with values of @xmath34 $ ] pixels .",
    "the two dimensional positions @xmath35 ( ra , dec ) of each star @xmath22 on the sky is converted to a position @xmath36 in the natural coordinate system of the cusp model by a shift , scale and rotation:@xmath37,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is a @xmath39 matrix encoding the two free parameters of scale and rotation , and @xmath40 represents the two free parameters that shift the position of the center of the model on the sky .",
    "finally the surface density @xmath41 computed at point @xmath36 is the sum of the background free @xmath26 , and a constant background level @xmath42 : @xmath43      we follow the same procedure for the exponential model as for the cusp model .",
    "the exponential model , in its natural units , is : @xmath44 and the model is not smoothed at all .",
    "the @xmath39 matrix @xmath38 used in this case is a symmetric tensor of scale and shear with three free parameters , used to calculate the position angle ( @xmath45 ) , ellipticity ( @xmath46 ) , and scale radius ( @xmath47 ) of the model .",
    "all models have been defined on grids of @xmath48 pixels , on the interval @xmath27=[-5,5 ] , and have six degrees of freedom .",

    "mcmc simulates the likelihood for a set of parameters by sampling from the posterior distribution through a series of random draws .",
    "we specifically use the metropolis - hastings algorithm , which generates a random walk and steps through each parameter in such a way that more probable values of parameter space are more often stepped to . for both the cusp and exponential models",
    "we choose a separable prior that is flat in center position ( @xmath40 ) , flat in the components of the @xmath38 matrix , and flat in the background level ( @xmath42 ) , with a lower limit of zero .",
    "there were no derivatives in our prior at the peaks in the likelihood , so the choice of prior does not affect any of our results .",
    "the acceptance ratios for all parameters are @xmath57 .",
    "though less computationally efficient , this method is similar to the maximum likelihood technique used by @xcite to determine the structural parameters of dwarf galaxies , and is better at escaping local minima .",
    "we find that a flattened exponential model is a far better fit to the hercules data than any of the seven cusp models tested in this work .",
    "of the seven cusp models tested , the cusp with a smoothing scale of @xmath58 pixels ( @xmath59 arcmin ) was found to be the most probable .",
    "the difference between the maximum likelihood of the exponential and best fit cusp model is @xmath60 nominally this rules out the best cusp model in favor of the exponential at a confidence level of @xmath61 .",
    "table 1 lists the parameters at maximum likelihood for the exponential and best cusp models . the structural parameters for",
    "the exponential model yield a position angle for hercules at @xmath62 , and an ellipticity of 0.65 ( defined as @xmath63 ) , both in good agreement with the findings of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the parameters that maximize the likelihood of the cusp model are such that the model is slightly smoothed , and highly scaled .",
    "this is not surprising since the cusp model is a poor fit to the data , and at its optimal configuration it will be smoothed and scaled in such a way to resemble an flattened exponential - like distribution near the center . if hercules were a 2-d projection of a cusp , the spatial distribution of its stars would show a highly elongated center of stars , along with two `` tails '' indicative of the two fold catastrophes .",
    "figure 2 shows the predicted spatial distribution of stars for the best fit exponential and cusp models .",
    "while the cusp model is strongly ruled out in favor of a flattened exponential , we make no claims that the exponential profile is the best available model for hercules .",
    "it has been suggested that some of the ultra - faint dwarf satellites of the milky way may be the 2-d projection of cusp caustics , and not gravitationally bound galaxies .",
    "the highly elliptical hercules dwarf is a good candidate for testing the cusp model , which predicts a highly elongated centroid of stars .",
    "we have established a hypothesis test in order to determine whether the hercules overdensity is better modeled with a cusp or an exponential , and rule out at very high confidence the possibility that hercules is a cusp catastrophe . while other surface brightness models have been fit to hercules data , such as the king @xcite and plummer @xcite profiles , we have chosen to not test such models here , and so have not evaluated how they compare to the flattened exponential model .",
    "this work also has not evaluated if the properties of the hercules galaxy are better explained by the exponential equilibrium model than by models of tidal disruption ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "our intention in this work is not to advocate that an exponential profile is the best explanation of the observed ellipticity of hercules , but rather to definitively remove from consideration the possibility that hercules is a cusp caustic .",
    "the work outlined in this paper can be used to test any of the milky way dwarfs suspected of being cusps .",
    "the highly elliptical dwarfs ursa major i and ii are interesting candidates for such a test , though both lack obvious evidence of the double spatial tail indicative of the fold caustics that meet at the cusp .",
    "furthermore , the cusp caustic predicts triple - valued velocities for stellar members of the cusp .",
    "spectroscopic data of the ultra - faint dwarfs suspected of being cusps can thus be used to further rule out or confirm such hypotheses .",
    "for example , spectroscopic data in the vicinity of the ultra - faint galaxy segue i @xcite show a lot of interesting structure , and could be used to test if segue i is a cusp .",
    "the techniques introduced in this paper can be further extended to implement a search for cusp and fold caustics on the entire sky , using data from a large survey like the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , _ gaia _ , or the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) .",
    "stellar streams and dwarf galaxies , which can be thought of , respectively , as one and ( blurry ) zero dimensional objects in phase phase , have been found with multi - band two - dimensional angular maps in photometric surveys , such as sdss .",
    "such data sets are two - dimensional , though some distance information can be determined at low signal - to - noise using colors , and are well suited for finding low dimensional structures . given the number of streams already known in the milky way s stellar halo , it is likely that higher dimensional structures in six - dimensional phase space exist , but have not yet been found in current data @xcite",
    ". future surveys that return full ( or nearly full ) phase - space information , such as the _ gaia _ mission @xcite , will be much better suited than current surveys for finding systems with higher dimensionality",
    ". meanwhile , such structures may only be easily identifiable in photometric data if their projection into 2-d observable space creates regions of enhanced density , like the cusp and fold caustics .",
