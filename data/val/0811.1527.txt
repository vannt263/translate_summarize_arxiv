    "functional soft materials composed of many nano - particles often appear in complex structure both as 2-dimensional films @xcite and 3-dimensional super - crystal structures @xcite .",
    "these structures emerge in various _ processes of self - assembly _ , most of which utilize liquid degrees of freedom and nonequilibrium methods @xcite .",
    "the gold nanoparticles are often used due to the property that their surfaces can be _",
    "functionalized _ in an appropriate manner .",
    "the functionalization of the nanoparticle surfaces has effects on their interactions @xcite . in the case of nanoaprticle films on substrate assembled by the liquid evaporation @xcite the thiol - passivated nanoparticles where used , where the attached chains determine the minimum distance between two neighbouring nanoparticles .",
    "another way to induce desired interaction between two nanoparticles was designed recently with attaching the pieces of biologically compatible strands of dna molecules to different nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "the dna - mediated interaction then utilizes the _ biological recognition _ and binding energy of the compatible dna base pairs . depending on the number of other factors , which we will also discuss later",
    ", this programmable self - assembly may lead to random as well as regular super - crystal structures , as shown in recent experiments in refs .",
    "@xcite . somewhat similar ( but in a different potential range ) , is the bio - recognition assembly which utilizes biologically compatible protein molecules , for instance the antigen ",
    "antibody recognition @xcite , which can be used in biosensors .",
    "the nanoparticle assemblies exhibit a wide range of physical properties which are not found in the bulk materials and at the level of a single nanoparticle @xcite .",
    "moreover , the emergent physical properties of the nanoparticle assemblies can often be related to their spatial structure @xcite .",
    "for instance , new optical and magnetic properties have been found in super - lattices made of nanocrystal @xcite . by speciffic functionalization of their surfaces",
    "gold nanoparticles develop directionally dependent exchange interaction @xcite . assuming that such nanoparticles can be arranged on nodes of a sparse scale - free graph",
    ", numerical simulations predict new features of the magnetic response of such a structure @xcite , compared to the classical memory materials @xcite . similarly , the films of gold nanoparticles under voltage bias conduct current via _ single - electron tunneling",
    "_ processes @xcite due to their small capacitances and the coulomb blocade effects @xcite .",
    "in contrast to classical conduction , the single - electron conduction processes have numerous advantages , e.g. , the absense of dissipation due to heathing , and the nonlinear current - voltage characteristics , which are important in the nanoelectronics . experimentally a large nonlinearity of the current  voltage curve has been found in self - assembled nanoparticle films on substrates , which appears to be fairly correlated with the film structure @xcite .",
    "the random structure of nanoparticle films on substrates can be adequately modelled by planar graphs ( _ nano - networks _ ) @xcite . for the charge transport via single - electron processes , which we study here , the topological elements of these nano - networks are suitably selected as follows : the _ nodes _ represent nanoparticles , whereas _ edges _ ( links ) are the tunneling junctions between two nanoparticles .",
    "for the junction ( link ) to occur between two nanoparticles , the distance between them must be smaller than the _ tunneling radius _ of the electrons for that kind of nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "the charge transport through the film under applied voltage can be described within the model of the capacitively - coupled nanoparticles on substrate @xcite . in our previous work @xcite we generalized the model of capacitively - coupled nanoparticle assemblies for an arbitrary topology of the nano - networks @xcite and implemented a numerical model of single - electron tunnelings driven by the external voltage through such networks .",
    "theoretical background and the details of the numerical implementation is reviewed in ref .",
    "the simulation results revealed the topology - induced nonlinearity in the @xmath0 curve , in a good agreement with the experiments @xcite .    in the present work we study the collective dynamic behavior which makes the physical basis for the observed @xmath0 nonlinearity , in particular , the long - range correlations in charge fluctuations monitored at each nanoparticle and inhomogeneous charge flow along the conducting paths through the sample and at the electrode .",
    "we determine the probability distributions of various quantities related to the conduction process and demonstrate how the topological and charge disorder affect the quantitative statistical properties and the @xmath0 dependences .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section  2 we present the model of the particle self - assembly with bio - recognition bonding and show some of the typical emergent structures . in section  3",
    "we summarize the theoretical background of the conduction with single - electron processes and its numerical implementation for an arbitrary network topology .",
    "the visualization of the conduction paths through two network types , the regular and inhomogeneous nanoparticle aggregates , as well as the statistical properties of the topological and charge flow are shown in section  4 . in section  5",
    "we analyse the simulated time series of charge and current fluctuations and the related @xmath0 curves .",
    "section  6 gives a short summary of the results .",
    "different assembly processes make use of the liquid phase , that provides the nanoparticle diffusion and affects the interaction .",
    "the assembly with fast evaporation of the liquid @xcite induces additional constraints to the particle motion and interaction .",
    "the interaction itself between pairs of the nanoparticles moving in a liquid is taking part at short distances and depends on the type of functionalization of their surfaces , as mentioned above . in the case of bio - recognition binding , which we will discuss shortly here ,",
    "the attached dna induce the differences between two types of nanoparticles , i.e. , type a and type b nanoparticles , each of which carry the biologically compatible strand of the same dna molecule .",
    "thus , the interaction between a  b type is attractive within some bonding distance @xmath1 .",
    "the bonding distance depends on the lengths of the attached molecules and on the number of the compatible base - pairs on them @xcite .",
    "therefore , it exceeds the sum of the particle radii @xmath2 . the effective interaction between a ",
    "b particles can be then modeled by the lennard - jones potential @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the actual distance between particles and the potential minimum corresponds to the optimal bonding distance . in the present case ,",
    "the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 depend , roughly speaking , on the lengths of the attached dna chains and the strength of binding ( number of the compatible base pairs)@xcite . on the contrary , the particles which carry biologically incompatible dna strands have no attractive interaction of this type . the repulsive part alone of the potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq - ljpotential ] ) can describe the interaction of the equal - type particles a  a and b  b , occurring at short distances .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the correlations in the current fluctuations at the electrode , i.e. , at the last layer of the nanoparticles connected to the electrode , are caused by the tunneling processes deeper in the sample .",
    "the time - series of the number of tunnelings \\{@xmath7 } at all nanoparticles in in the whole network and their power spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - nt ] .",
    "the power spectrum of the number of tunnelings exhibits long - range correlations for high frequencies , according to @xmath8 the exponent @xmath9 ( within numerical error bars ) for the topologically disordered nano - network nnet1 , suggesting strong cooperation between the conducting paths .",
    "whereas , the correlations are much weaker in the triangular array , leading to @xmath10 for high frequencies , and the absence of correlations at low frequencies .",
    "in our numerical study of the conducting nanoparticle films on substrates , we pointed out several steps that play an important role in designing the conduction properties of the films . specifically , we study in quantitative details the emergent properties of such nanoparticle assemblies along the line from the self - assembly processes , the topology of structures , and conduction through such structures .    *   _ self - assembly _ processes are leading to different types of structures of the film .",
    "we have shown that both regular and highly inhomogeneous nanoparticle films , which are typically fabricated in entirely different techniques@xcite , can be assembled within the same process with the bio - recognition binding and varying a single control parameter .",
    "*   _ conducting paths _ through the film have been identified and their topological centrality and the dynamical flow computed for for @xmath11 .",
    "coalescence of flow along different paths contributes to the nonlinear @xmath0 dependences in a range of voltages above the transition @xmath12 . in our simulations ,",
    "the nonlinearity exponent @xmath13 depends strongly on the structure , in agreement with measured @xmath14 curves in different nanoparticle films @xcite . *   _ collective dynamical effects _ in the tunneling processes deep inside the sample lead to the non - gaussian current fluctuations at the electrode .",
    "we have determined various statistical measures of these collective effects .",
    "in particular , we find the long - range correlations in charge fluctuations at all nanoparticles , broad distribution of flow on junctions through the nano - network , and non - gaussian distribution of the current increments on the electrode . a non - gaussian distribution have been found in the experiments with nanowires @xcite .",
    "our numerical results suggest that @xmath15-gaussian distribution with different parameters could be measured in the nanoparticle films .",
    "the occurrence of the @xmath15gaussian in a larger class of complex dynamical systems with long - range interactions has been discussed recently @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate how different types of disorder affect the conduction in our comparative study of the regular nanoparticle array in the presence of local charge disorder , on one side , and the topologically inhomogeneous nano - network without charge disorder , on the other .",
    "we hope that our detailed numerical study of the processes leading to different structures and the structure - dependent function of the nanoparticle assemblies sheds a new light on the problem of engineering of the functional materials with desired characteristics .",
