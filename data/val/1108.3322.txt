    "systems involving particles with 2-body interactions at or close to the unitary limit have become of specific interest in the physics community during the last several years for reasons that have repeatedly been pointed out in numerous publications related to both atomic and sub - atomic problems .",
    "the unitary limit is here defined as being that for which the scattering length @xmath0 and the effective range @xmath1 is infinite and zero respectively .    in this regard",
    "the bound system of three bosons is of special interest .",
    "this was first brought to the attention by the works of thomas @xcite and of vitali efimov@xcite .",
    "bosons interacting with a resonance in the 2-body state ( i.e. @xmath14 ) result in a strongly bound three - body system _ and with a spectrum of loosely bound excited states .",
    "_    the literature has brought to the attention several systems in nature for which these findings are relevant .    on the theoretical side",
    "the application of effective field theory ( eft ) methods have been proven very powerful@xcite for a theoretical interpretation .",
    "the main focus has been on short - ranged potentials at or near the unitary limit for which @xmath15 , but more recent eft publications include effective range corrections.@xcite    a rather different approach is used here .",
    "the inverse scattering formalism for separable potentials is used to construct potentials as functions of the scattering parameters as well as 2-body binding energy , and renormalised by a cut - off in momentum - space .",
    "the potential in the unitary limit , a renormalised @xmath16-function ( in coordinate ) space , is of specific interest .",
    "the results presented below agree with previous efimov physics calculations for @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath6 results do in general show some qualitative differences .",
    "the present investigation focuses on efimov energies and the efimov function , dependence on scattering length and in particular on the effective range .",
    "some preliminary results were given in ref.@xcite    scaling properties are a main thread in this work .",
    "in section 2 is found a presentation of the necessary tools which are the faddeev equation and the inverse scattering method .",
    "section 3 show results of numerical calculations in 4 subsections with 8 figures .",
    "section 4 is a summary and some discussion of the results .",
    "some relations regarding off - shell scattering and three - body forces are shown in appendix a , while appendix b shows an important relation pertaining to scattering and the separable interaction in the unitary limit .",
    "the input for the calculations in this report are scattering phase - shifts @xmath18 related to the scattering length @xmath0 and an effective range @xmath1 by @xmath19 a momentum cut - off @xmath3 will also be defined so that @xmath20 .    with the scattering parameters chosen so that the phase - shifts do not change sign ,",
    "as will be the case here , they can be reproduced by a rank-1 separable potential    @xmath21    that is obtained by inverse scattering from@xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 \\label{d}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 denotes the principal value .",
    "the interaction is fully defined by the phase - shifts and the two - body binding energy @xmath25 .",
    "note that the two fits , to scattering and to binding energy are independent .",
    "the equation @xmath26 relates @xmath25 to [ @xmath27 but only for @xmath15 and it is not useful for the calculations below . in the limit @xmath5",
    "it reduces to @xmath28 which will be used also when @xmath29 together with @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "this simplifies the comparison with the @xmath5 calculations in these preliminary calculations .",
    "the major importance is that the 2-body system _ has a bound state . ) . ] _    when dealing with some specific physical system one ( in general ) knows or assumes some binding - energy , but this is not the case here .",
    "the expression ( [ eb ] ) for the binding energy does not introduce another parameter in the theory , being a function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 only , but if in some specific case one would tune the binding enrgy say by some shape - parameter there would be another parameter to consider .      a well - known reason for _ assuming a separable interaction in 3- and other many - body works is that it in general simplifies the formalism as well as the numerical calculations .",
    "there is however a particular case where the interaction is separable .",
    "namely that when the 2-body system has a bound state at or close to zero@xcite , which is the case in the unitary limit . _    the principal value integration in eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) can be done analytically for @xmath18=constant .",
    "the unitary limit is a special case with @xmath32 , for which the rank-1 separable potential @xmath33 is given by @xcite    @xmath34    if @xmath35 one finds @xmath36 in this limit , _ but only in this limit , the unitary interaction is independent of momentum and a @xmath16-function in coordinate space with the strength inversely proportional to the cut - off .",
    "but for the finite values of @xmath3 needed for computations , renormalisation is required resulting in @xmath37 as given by eq .",
    "( [ vpi2 ] ) .",
    "note that there is then an abrupt increase in strength and a singularity as @xmath38 .",
    "this is required to preserve the condition @xmath39 for all @xmath40 , as required for the unitary limit .",
    "( see appendix b. ) _    the singularity can cause numerical problems that however can be largely overcome by proper computational methods .",
    "the substitution @xmath41 with @xmath42 the new variable , can for example be helpful yielding @xmath43 which is used successfully in the computations .. which can eliminate the @xmath44 in the denominator of ( [ vtheta ] ) ] fig .",
    "[ efvsep ] shows the unitary interaction ( lowest curve ) and for comparison two other potentials with @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively .      a rank-1 potential is often sufficient to fit the on - shell data at low energy as is done in this report . the off - shell and off - diagonal parts of the t - matrix",
    "is then fixed by default",
    ".    on - shell relates to the asymptotic form of the two - body scattering wave - function , while off - shell relates to the interior wave - function , i.e. to correlations in the two - body system .",
    "one may however like to change the off - shell behaviour .",
    "this can be done by extending to a rank-2 ( or higher ) potential ( which implies introducing another parameter ) , while preserving the on - shell fit .",
    "this provides a practical tool for exploring off - shell effects on many - body properties .",
    "the 3-boson system collapses in the unitary limit ( the energy diverges ) with @xmath3 .",
    "this is well - known . in ref.@xcite this collapse",
    "was remedied by adding a 3-body force .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that the same could be accomplished by a change in off - shell scattering with a rank-2 potential as described above .    in each of these methods",
    "the high energy ( ultraviolet ) region of the interaction was modified ; in one case by a three - body force in the other by a change in off - shell scattering .",
    "although the two methods have a similar end - result it is important to understand that in each case there is a different physics involved .",
    "( appendix a. )    findings below show that the effective range also has the effect of preventing a collapse .",
    "this is not completely un - expected as it explicitly introduces a finite range parameter into the system .",
    "the faddeev three - boson equation for a spin - independent rank-1 separable potential is given by @xmath47 with @xmath48 with the phase - shifts defined , as announced above , in terms of two scattering parameters and the cut - off @xmath3 one will have @xmath49 . in the present investigation the scattering parameters @xmath50 $ ] are considered _ internal parameters defining the 3-body system , while @xmath51 $ ] is considered an _",
    "external parameter if possible chosen larger than the maximum momenta of the bound particles .",
    "this means in general that one has to choose @xmath52 with @xmath53 being the physical size of the system .",
    "this size is a functional of the interaction ( the internal parameters ) and so is therefore @xmath3 .",
    "as an example , the three - body system collapses in the unitary limit , with @xmath54 , a well - known divergence . _ _    three separate cases will be considered here with results presented in three separate sections .",
    "the first will be the unitary limit i.e. both @xmath1 and @xmath8 .",
    "the second is @xmath55 while @xmath5 and the third the more general case , both @xmath1 and @xmath56 .",

    "( @xmath75 would be the correct value . )      in this second scenario with @xmath5 while @xmath76 one will have @xmath77 .",
    "this case has been the focus of numerous investigations since the early works of thomas and efimov ; in particular as relates to experimental studies of cold atoms and the ability to tune the scattering length with the aid of feshbach resonances .",
