    "the baryon asymmetry of the universe can be generated by the sphaleron decay during the electroweak phase transition .",
    "for calculating the sphaleron decay rate in the early universe a new method in finite temperature field theory has been developed @xcite .",
    "after a brief introduction to some basic concepts of thermal field theory , three examples of its application to astrophysical problems are discussed : neutrino interactions in a supernova plasma , strange quark matter in neutron stars and as a dark matter candidate , and the interaction of light with the cosmic microwave background .",
    "perturbative field theory at finite temperature or density is based either on the so - called imaginary ( itf ) or real time formalism ( rtf ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) . as a simple example for illustrating these methods we will discuss the @xmath7-theory at finite temperature briefly .",
    "the most important quantity in perturbative field theory is the feynman propagator . at zero temperature",
    "it is defined as the vacuum expectation value of the time - ordered product of two field operators . at finite temperature",
    "the vacuum expectation value has to be replaced by a thermal expectation value containing a sum over all thermally excited states .",

    "here we use the notation @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "this expression has a simple physical interpretation . at @xmath13",
    "the propagator describes the creation of a scalar particle at the space - time point @xmath14 ( for @xmath15 ) and its propagation to @xmath16 , where it is destroyed . at finite temperature",
    "there is besides spontaneous creation at @xmath14 , given by the term 1 in the square brackets , also induced emission and absorption proportional to @xmath17 due to the presence of the heat bath .    in the itf",
    "the propagator given above can be expressed as a sum over discrete , imaginary energies ( matsubara frequencies ) , @xmath18 , i _",
    "f^t>0 ( x - y)=it _ k_0 e^-ik(x - y ) .",
    "[ itf ] the itf will be exemplified by calculating the simplest self energy in the scalar theory , namely the tadpole diagram shown in figure  [ fig : tadpole ] .",

    "we can construct an effective , in - medium propagator by using the dyson - schwinger equation , @xmath24 , yielding ^*=. [ effprop ] this propagator agrees with the bare one if the bare mass , @xmath25 , is replaced by the effective mass @xmath26 .",
    "the dispersion relation of the scalar field in the medium follows from the poles of the effective propagator : @xmath27 .",
    "an alternative method to the itf is the rtf , where the thermal propagator in momentum space is given by i ( k ) = + 2 n_b(|k_0| ) ( k^2-m^2 ) . [ rtf ] in order to avoid unphysical singularities from products of @xmath28-functions , which can appear in diagrams with two propagators , the propagator has been extended to a @xmath29-matrix @xcite .",
    "an important advantage of the rtf compared with the itf is the possible generalization to non - equilibrium by replacing the equilibrium distribution in ( [ rtf ] ) by a non - equilibrium .",
    "now we will turn to gauge theories ( qed , qcd , electroweak theory ) at finite temperature and density , which are relevant for astrophysical situations . as an important example we consider the one - loop qed polarization tensor in an electron - positron plasma shown in figure  [ fig : polarization ] .",
    "in contrast to the tadpole diagram the polarization tensor is energy and momentum dependent .",
    "it can be calculated exactly only in the high - temperature limit which is equivalent to the hard - thermal - loop ( htl ) limit , in which the loop momentum is assumed to be much larger than the external momentum .",
    "the high - temperature limit corresponds to an ultrarelativistic electron - positron plasma as it exists in supernovae . due to the breaking of lorentz invariance by choosing the frame of the heat bath ,",
    "the polarization tensor has two independent components , for which we take the longitudinal and the transverse . in the htl limit they read _",
    "l(p_0,p)&=&-3 m_^2(1- ) , + _ t(p_0,p)&= & m_^2 , [ htlpolar ] where @xmath30 can be regarded as a thermal photon `` mass '' . however , it should be noted that this mass does not break gauge invariance .    by resumming the polarization tensor using the dyson - schwinger equation",
    "we construct an effective photon propagator which describes the propagation of collective photon modes ( plasmons ) in a qed plasma .",
    "the corresponding dispersion relations for the longitudinal and the transverse plasma waves are shown in figure  [ fig : dispersion ] .",
    "finally , let me mention that in the case of two - loop self energies , from which e.g. damping rates follow , infrared singularities and gauge dependent results ( `` plasmon puzzle '' ) are encountered .",
    "braaten and pisarski @xcite developed a method , the htl resummation technique , for avoiding these problems , which allows a consistent treatment of gauge theories at finite temperature .",
    "neutrinos are copiously emitted from the core of a supernova .",
    "they interact with the surrounding plasma , providing an effective mechanism for energy deposition , which pushes the shock wave outwards and finally triggers the explosion @xcite .",
    "important neutrino interaction processes in the plasma are @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .    the differential rate for instance for @xmath34-annihilation is given by = m^ \\{_(q_1+q_2 ) } , [ diffrate ] where m^=8(q_2^q_1^+ q_1^q_2 ^ - ( q_1 q_2 ) g^ + i q_1",

    "to lowest order in the fermi theory the latter is given by figure  [ fig : fermi ] .",
    "the total rate follows from the differential rate by convolution with the neutrino distributions : r_|= & & [ f_(q_1)f_|(q_2 ) + & & - ( 1-f_(q_1))(1-f_|(q_2 ) ) ] e^-e / t_e ] .",
    "[ totrate ] similar expressions for the differential and total rate can be derived for @xmath36-scattering .",
    "alternatively the rates can be calculated from the scattering amplitude , & & = [ 1-n_e^+(e_1 ) ] + & & [ 1-n_e^-(e_2 ) ] ( 2)^4 ^ 4(q_1+q_2-p_1-p_2 ) _",

    "in addition to medium effects at finite temperature and density we consider a strong magnetic field , which plays an important role in supernovae and neutron stars .",
    "recently magnetic field strengths above @xmath38 g have been observed in so - called magnetars @xcite . in a magnetic field",
    "the electrons and positrons are in landau levels , which leads to a modified electron propagator in the polarization tensor .",
    "the magnetic field can absorb momentum , allowing for new processes such as the gyromagnetic absorption @xmath39 .",
    "the advantage of starting from the polarization tensor instead of the scattering amplitude is the automatic inclusion of all possible processes ( annihilation , scattering , gyromagnetic absorption ) .",
    "using the approach described above , we found a strong modification of the rates of the various processes in fields at @xmath40 g. in particular there are pronounced peaks in the rates coming from the landau levels , new processes like the gyromagnetic absorption become important , and the processes show a strong anisotropy , which could play a role in gamma - ray bursts @xcite . in the figures  [ fig : bdepend ] to [ fig : aniso ] these features are illustrated .",
    "quark matter consisting of up , down and strange quarks may exist in the interior of neutron stars or even in form of strangelets , if quark matter is stable , i.e. , if it has a higher binding energy than iron @xcite .",
    "strangelets have also been discussed as a possible dark matter candidate @xcite .",
    "so far calculations of the equation of state ( eos ) of strange matter are based on an ideal fermi gas , where sometimes also one - gluon exchange effects are included @xcite .    here",
    "we want to consider medium effects at finite density and vanishing temperature , which lead to effective quark masses . using the one - loop quark self energy in the high - density limit",
    ", an effectice in - medium quark propagator is constructed .",
    "the dispersion relation at zero momentum following from this propagator defines the effective , density dependent quark mass @xcite ( p=0)=m_q^*=+ ( + ) ^1/2 , [ qmass ] where @xmath41 is the quark chemical potential of the order of 300 mev .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath42 , typically of the order 2 - 4 , can be regarded as a parameter describing the medium effect of the effective quark mass , which arises naturally due to the interactions as known from mean - field theories in many - particle physics .",
    "consequently we replace the ideal fermi gas by a quasiparticle gas , where e.g. the particle density is now given by ( ) = [ ^2-m_q^*^2()]^3/2 , [ density ] where @xmath43 is the degree of freedom , e.g. @xmath44 for strange quarks .",
    "similar expressions for the energy density and the pressure determining the eos can be found .",
    "the introduction of an effective quark mass , typically of the order of 100 mev , reduces the binding energy of strange quark matter and renders the existence of stable strangelets as a dark matter candidate unlikely @xcite .",
    "furthermore we studied the influence of the quark medium effects on strange stars and hybrid stars , i.e. neutron stars containing a quark matter core , by solving the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation using the eos for quark matter derived above .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : mass_radius ] the effective quark mass has a negligible effect on the mass - radius relation of strange stars . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of a quark matter core , reduces the radius of a neutron star by typically 20 - 30 % , which might have observable consequences @xcite .",
    "this reduction is caused by a softening of the eos due to the presence of a mixed phase .",
    "it also reduces the maximum mass of the star to about 1.5 @xmath45 .",
    "recently it has been speculated that quark matter at high density should be in a color superconducting phase @xcite .",
    "while this could have some consequences for the cooling behavior of neutron stars @xcite , it probably does not affect bulk properties , such as the mass - radius relation , since the pairing takes place only close to the fermi surface .",
    "although the cross section for photon - photon interaction is very small , light propagating through the universe interacts continuously with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . as discussed in section  [ sec : thermal ] photons may acquire an effective mass in a thermal medium . on the other hand ,",
    "there are very small upper limits for the photon mass deduced from laboratory experiments ( @xmath46 ev ) and from the galactic magnetic field ( @xmath47 ev ) @xcite .",
    "therefore it is of interest to consider medium effects of light in the cmb .",
    "the photon - photon interaction of low energy photons ( @xmath48 ) can be described by an effective lagrangian @xcite _ i=- ( f _ f^)^2 + f _ f^ f _ f^ , [ euler ] where @xmath49 is the electron mass , @xmath50 the fine structure constant , and @xmath51 the field strength tensor .",
    "the lowest order photon self energy following from this lagrangian is shown in figure  [ fig : photon ] .",
    "a gauge invariant definition of the debye mass of the photon relates it to the photon self energy in the following way @xcite : @xmath53 . using ( [ photself ] )",
    "one finds that the debye mass vanishes , @xmath54 .",
    "also the effective photon `` mass '' or plasma frequency , defined as the zero momentum limit of the dispersion relation , @xmath55 , vanishes , @xmath56 .",
    "hence there is no conflict with the measured upper limits of the photon mass .",
    "the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability are also related to the photon self energy : & = & 1-=1 + , + & = & 1+=1- .",
    "[ perm ] from these quantities the phase velocity @xmath57 and the index of refraction @xmath58 follow as v_p===1- . [ phase_velocity ] since the temperature of the universe drops with time , the phase velocity increases continuously to its vacuum value .",
    "whereas it was given by @xmath59 , when radiation and matter decoupled at about @xmath60 k , it increased today at @xmath61 k to @xmath62 .",
    "although this is probably not a measurable effect , it is amusing to note that the speed of light is not a constant in our universe ."
