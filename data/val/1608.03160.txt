    "a three - dimensional weyl semimetal has topological features that are lacking in its two - dimensional counterpart , graphene @xcite .",
    "one striking feature is the appearance of surface states , in fermi arcs connecting weyl cones of opposite topological charge ( helicity or berry curvature ) @xcite . unlike the surface states of a topological insulator , which are the only source of metallic conduction , the fermi arcs at the surface compete with the weyl cones in the bulk when it comes to transport properties .",
    "quantum oscillations in the magnetoresistance are one example of an effect where the fermi arcs play a prominent role @xcite , the chiral magnetic effect without landau levels is another example @xcite .",
    "an interesting way to differentiate surface from bulk is to bring the weyl semimetal into contact with a superconductor .",
