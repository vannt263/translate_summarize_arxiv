    "both disorder and thermal fluctuations strongly affect the properties of the vortex array induced in type ii superconductors by an external magnetic field.@xcite .",
    "one of the most striking consequences of thermal fluctuations , particularly pronounced in the high-@xmath0 materials , is the resistive vortex liquid state,@xcite located between the @xmath1 line and the vortex solid in the magnetic field ( h)-temperature ( t ) phase diagram.@xcite upon field cooling , a vortex liquid freezes into an abrikosov vortex solid .",
    "the nature of the freezing transition and of the resulting vortex solid phase depends on the amount of disorder present in the material . in dirty samples",
    "the vortex solid has been described as a `` vortex glass'',@xcite and its translational correlation length is limited by disorder to a _",
    "value.@xcite in three dimensions , the low temperature vortex glass solid is expected to be a true superconductor with a vanishing _",
    "linear _ resistivity . for weak disorder",
    ", the vortex solid state is expected to be a topologically ordered `` bragg '' glass state in three dimensions , with logarithmically growing vortex displacements , but bound dislocation loops.@xcite the freezing transition of the vortex array has been observed to be first order@xcite in ultra clean samples and continuous in dirty superconductors.@xcite    in very clean samples , where the disorder - limited translational correlation length is thousands of intervortex lattice constants , the low temperature phase can be well approximated by a vortex _ lattice_. within an elastic description , the primary low temperature excitations of the vortex lattice are phonons , characterizing two - dimensional displacements of vortex lines from their preferred lattice positions . as the temperature ( or field )",
    "is raised towards the melting transition , other excitations become important . by definition ,",
    "these are _ defects _ in the vortex lattice , i.e. they are not describable in terms of single - valued vortex displacements .",
    "these line defects are dislocations , disclinations , vacancies and interstitials and must be included in the model for a complete description of the melting of the vortex solid and of the properties of the resulting vortex liquid state .    at low temperatures , in a well - ordered abrikosov lattice state,@xcite these defects",
    "are bound , as the energy of an isolated _ line _ defect diverges with system size . at higher temperatures entropy",
    "can , however , drive a proliferation of these line defects , in analogy with the melting of two - dimensional solids.@xcite two melting scenarios are possible:@xcite ( i ) a one - stage first order transition from a solid to an _ isotropic _ vortex liquid where _ both _ dislocations and disclinations unbind simultaneously ( as it occurs in the melting of ordinary 3d solids ) , ( ii ) a two - stage , possibly continuous transition@xcite , where dislocations unbind first , leading to a hexatic flux - line liquid with residual bond - orientational order , vanishing shear modulus , but finite hexatic stiffness .",
    "this first transition would then be followed by a proliferation of disclination loops , thereby completing the transition into an _",
    "isotropic _ vortex liquid .",
    "the first stage of this second scenario for the melting of the abrikosov lattice was first suggested by marchetti and nelson.@xcite while avoiding the subtle question of the melting transition itself , they adapted the method developed long ago by nelson and toner@xcite to describe the vortex line - liquid state .",
    "marchetti and nelson described the hexatic vortex liquid as a vortex lattice with an equilibrium concentration of dislocation loops , treating the latter in the debye - huckle approximation . through detailed calculations",
    ", they demonstrated that dislocations drive the long wavelength shear modulus of the system to zero and computed the effective hexatic stiffness of the resulting orientationally ordered vortex liquid.@xcite    vacancies and interstitials constitute another class of defects that play an important role in solids . in ordinary crystals and in 2d",
    "vortex lattices , these _ point _ defects cost finite energy and are therefore present in finite density , at _ any finite _ temperature .",
    "while their static effects in these systems are minimal , their density represents an important hydrodynamic mode which must be included in the correct description of crystal hydrodynamics.@xcite    in strong contrast , in vortex lattices , vacancies and interstitials are _ line _ defects with energy proportional to their length and thereby diverging in bulk samples .",
    "hence one expects that at low temperatures their average density vanishes . at higher temperatures , this positive energetic contribution to the free energy",
    "can , however , be compensated by a negative entropic contribution associated with line wandering , which also scales with the defect length , in analogy with the kosterlitz - thouless picture.@xcite these considerations allow two thermodynamically distinct crystalline phases , with a sharp phase transition between them . while in both phases dislocations and disclinations are bound , and as a consequence there is long - range translational order ( true bragg spots in an x - ray scattering experiment ) and a finite shear modulus , line vacancies and interstitials are bound in the low temperature crystal , but have proliferated in the high temperature crystal phase . a thermodynamically sharp distinction between these two crystal phases in three - dimensional vortex systems was first emphasized by m.p.a .",
    "fisher and lee@xcite based on the mathematical correspondence between vortex lines and world - lines of two - dimensional quantum bosons . in this mapping the low temperature vortex crystal maps onto a 2d wigner crystal and the high temperature vortex",
    "solid corresponds to the quantum supersolid phase of 2d bosons , with vacancies and interstitials in its ground state .",
    "the quantum supersolid is quite exotic , in that it is both crystalline and superfluid .",
    "correspondingly , due to the finite density of vacancies and interstitials in the vortex supersolid , vortex lines can move arbitrarily far and entangle , as in a vortex liquid , and therefore this phase exhibits finite linear resistivity .    while experiments seem to rule out the existence of an equilibrated vortex supersolid phase in bulk 2d _ quantum _ crystals , based on detailed calculations , frey , nelson and d.s .",
    "fisher,@xcite have argued that such a phase is more likely to exist in flux - line arrays at high fields because of the layered structure of high temperature superconductors .",
    "these authors conclude that a vortex supersolid phase will certainly exist in anisotropic superconductors for magnetic fields above a decoupling field @xmath2 where vortices in different cuo@xmath3 layers are essentially decoupled by thermal fluctuations.@xcite furthermore , even if an equilibrium supersolid phase was absent , an appreciable nonequilibrium density of vacancies and interstitials may still be present in a flux - line lattice , when the vortex array undergoes a first order freezing transition upon cooling in a constant field .",
    "in this paper we study the effects of vacancies and interstitials within the vortex supersolid and liquid phases . as discussed above , in the supersolid phase , aside from being responsible for its existence",
    ", these defects provide a mechanism for vortex line wandering and consequently for its finite resistivity .",
    "they also are important degrees of freedom , in addition to phonons , that must be incorporated in the correct description of the supersolid . in sec.[supersolid ] we construct a model of a vortex supersolid , as an elastic lattice with an equilibrium concentration of unbound vacancies and interstitials .",
    "we compute the flux - line density correlation functions , that characterize the static equilibrium properties of this phase , and extract from these the effective elastic moduli of the supersolid phase .",
    "we find that the long - wavelength shear modulus is unaffected by the _ fluctuations _ in the density of vacancies and interstitials .",
    "this result is consistent with the vacancy - interstitials inability to relax shear , and confirms the finiteness of the supersolid shear rigidity which distinguishes it from a vortex liquid .",
    "we also compute a finite , downward renormalization of the compressional and tilt moduli by vacancy and interstitial density fluctuations .",
    "we demonstrate that as a consequence of the reduction of the effective tilt modulus , the flux - line _ wandering _ is enhanced and , analogously to a vortex liquid , a bulk vortex supersolid is always entangled , i.e. , it does not exhibit longitudinal superconductivity .",
    "the existence of a vortex supersolid allows for two scenarios for the melting transition into the vortex liquid state . at low magnetic fields , we expect@xcite this transition to be directly from the low temperature , non - supersolid crystal into a vortex liquid phase . as discussed above , the vortex liquid state itself can be either a fully disordered isotropic liquid or a bond - orientationally ordered liquid that can further disorder into an isotropic liquid via disclination unbinding .

    "alternatively , the non - supersolid crystal can first undergo a transition into a vortex supersolid by a proliferation of vacancies and interstitials,@xcite and subsequently melt into a vortex liquid.@xcite these two scenarios have been dubbed as type i and type ii melting , respectively,@xcite and are illustrated in fig.1 .",
    "very recent experiments investigating vortex penetration through surface barriers in the presence of a transport current in clean bscco samples have indeed indicated that the nature of the melting line may change at high field , even in the absence of point disorder.@xcite in fact these experiments suggest the existence of an intermediate phase between the solid and the liquid at high fields . this observed regime lies above the first order melting line determined by equilibrium magnetization measurements , but apparently exhibits a certain amount of sixfold periodicity , as indicated by neutron scattering.@xcite it is therefore a candidate for either the supersolid or the hexatic liquid phases studied here .",
    "although the nature of the type i and type ii melting transitions should be quite different,@xcite in either case vacancies and interstitials should proliferate in the resulting vortex liquid state.@xcite hence , in addition to dislocations , vacancy and interstitial defects _ must _ be taken into account for the proper description of a vortex liquid .",
    "they were not , however , explicitly included in the calculations of ref .. when vacancies and interstitials are absent , dislocation loops in the vortex line - lattice are restricted to lie in the plane defined by the magnetic field axis and their burger s vector , and can only glide ( see fig.5 ) , but not climb .",
    "one of the consequences of this is that the effective tilt modulus of the vortex liquid is not renormalized by dislocations and in the model of ref .",
    "is therefore identical to that of the vortex lattice .",
    "the results presented in sec.[liquid ] remedy the limitations of ref .",
    ", by explicitly including vacancies and interstitials in the description of a vortex liquid .",
    "vacancies and interstitials renormalize the tilt and compressional moduli and allow dislocation loops to climb out of their glide plane by absorbing and emitting these defects . at long wavelengths ,",
    "however , the coupling of dislocations to vacancies and interstitials does not yield any _ additional independent _ renormalization of the tilt and compressional moduli . whether this is a general property of the vortex lattice , or an artifact of the quadratic model and the debye - huckel approximation used here ,",
    "remains an open question .",
    "our work yields a complete description of a bond - orientationally ordered hexatic vortex liquid , whose tilt and bulk moduli are renormalized by dislocations , vacancies and interstitials , and whose shear modulus is driven to zero by the proliferation of these defects .",
    "our results characterizing the properties of the various phases shown in fig.1 are summarized in the two tables below .",
    "we stress that hexatic i and hexatic ii are not two distinct hexatic phases , but rather two different regimes within the same hexatic phase , distinguished by a high and low concentration of vacancy / interstitial defects , respectively .",
    "the crossover between these two regimes is indicated in fig.1 by a dotted line .",
    "the results quoted in table 1 for the hexatic i phase are those obtained by marchetti and nelson in ref . assuming that no vacancy / interstitial defects are present in the system .",
    "these results , however , only apply well below the dotted line in fig.1 , very close to the solid - hexatic phase boundary . as the transition to the isotropic liquid",
    "is approached , the large number of interacting dislocation loops present in the hexatic will invitably generate vacancy / interstitial defects as well , leading to the breakdown of the model of ref .. the type of long - range order present or absent in each of these phases is summarized qualitatively in table 2 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table 2 .",
    "this table displays the presence or absence of translational and orientational long - range order ( lro ) as well as longitudinal superconductivity in each phase .",
    "the asterisk serves to emphasize that although the supersolid does not exhibit longitudinal superconductivity , the degree of screening of longitudinal currents in this phase is substantially different from that of the vortex liquid phase ( see table 1 ) .    2",
    "we begin by recalling the properties of an ordered , _ defect - free _ vortex lattice , which we expect to be stable at low temperature and field in a clean superconductor.@xcite as discussed in the introduction , long - scale degrees of freedom of this system are uniquely characterized by a single - valued vortex displacement field , @xmath5 . with the convection in which the external magnetic field @xmath6 ( aligned with the @xmath7 axis of the superconductor ) points along the @xmath8 axis ,",

    "since the screening currents involved in the shear perturbation run parallel to the applied field @xmath69 , a perfect meissner response to a shear perturbation has also been termed longitudinal superconductivity .",

    "we will return to this point again in sec.[liquid ] .",
    "finally , we note that in the latter @xmath66 limit , the transverse part of the tilt correlation function corresponds to the world - lines winding number @xmath71 studied by pollock and ceperley@xcite in their path integral approach to the superfluid transition in quantum boson systems . in such an approach , dating back to feynman , the superfluid phase is identified with an entangled state of boson world - line trajectories , @xmath72 and @xmath73 the boson superfluid density .",

    "once vacancy and interstitial line defects proliferate in the supersolid , their positions and orientations represent new and important low - energy degrees of freedom , independent of the lattice displacements characterized by the field @xmath87 . at finite temperature , these defects will lead to fluctuations in the local induction , independent , but energetically coupled to , local elastic strains . to incorporate such defect fluctuations ,",
    "we adapt the hydrodynamic methods developed for vortex lines,@xcite to the hydrodynamics of the vacancy and interstitial line - liquid .    at finite density ,",

    "in contrast , these defect fluctuations yield a finite downward renormalization of both the compressional and tilt moduli .",
    "the renormalization of the tilt modulus stems from the fact that the liquid of vacancy and interstitial defects promotes flux - line wandering .",
    "we explicitly demonstrate that this defect - based vortex line delocalization mechanism spoils the meissner response to a shear tilt perturbation , characteristic of the defect - free vortex lattice .",
    "in other words , the vortex supersolid does not exhibit longitudinal superconductivity and , in this respect , similarly to the vortex liquid , is always entangled .",
    "it is clear that the vortex liquid phase , where unbound dislocation loops have proliferated , is also characterized by a finite density of vacancy and interstitials , which _ must _ , therefore , be included for a consistent description of such a resistive phase . a model of the vortex - line liquid as a solid with an equilibrium concentration of unbound dislocation loops , but no vacancies and interstitials ,",
    "was previously studied by marchetti and nelson @xcite . as a consequence of no - vacancy / interstitial constraint implicit in their model , only planar loops , that can not climb out of their glide plane ,",

    "we have generalized this model by allowing for a gas of vacancy and interstitial line defects , coupled to the dislocation loop gas and the elastic ( phonon ) degrees of freedom , to be present in the orientationally ordered vortex liquid .",
    "we explicitly demonstrated that a finite concentration of these vacancy and interstitial defects allows the dislocation loops to climb out of their glide plane by emitting and absorbing vacancies and interstitials , and allows for new types of edge dislocations ( otherwise forbidden ) , thereby significantly increasing the entropy of topological defects characterizing the vortex liquid .",
    "this physical result is mathematically summarized by eq.[contdv ] , in which non - planar dislocation loops and horizontal edge dislocations , with burger s vector in the xy - plane , act as sources for vacancy and interstitial line defects .",
    "this resulting climb - like motion provides a mechanism for the relaxation of an externally applied tilt , not present in the model of ref .. we find , however , that at long wavelengths there is _ no independent _ renormalization of the tilt and compressional moduli by dislocations , other than that already induced in the supersolid by fluctuations in the density and orientation of vacancy and interstitial defects .",
    "this result is somewhat puzzling and may be a consequence of the debye - huckel approximation used to here .",
    "we are currently investigating the extension of the model presented here beyond the ( quadratic ) debye - huckel treatment of defects in order to answer this question .",
    "the coupling of dislocations to vacancy and interstitial defects does , however , affect the response to a shear tilt perturbation that probes longitudinal superconductivity . while both , the vortex supersolid and the vortex liquid fail to exhibit longitudinal superconductivity , and are therefore always entangled , in the supersolid it is only the response of the vacancy and interstitial defects ( which form only a small fraction of the total vortex - flux density ) that spoils the meissner effect , as @xmath360 where @xmath101 is the tilt modulus of the vacancy - interstitial defect gas . the transverse susceptibility @xmath361 , while larger than @xmath362 the value required for a perfect meissner response  remains negative ( diamagnetic ) and finite .",
    "we expect therefore still an appreciable screening of longitudinal currents , running along the applied field direction .",

    "at all , but very low vortex densities @xmath364 and the diamagnetic susceptibility is therefore vanishingly small .",
    "hence , as expected , the fully entangled vortex liquid has essentially normal response to a shear tilt perturbation and exhibits no longitudinal superconductivity .",
    "we hope that the results for the properties of the supersolid and hexatic phases , and as well as for the transitions scenarios from and into them , presented here , will serve as a useful guide for identifying these exotic phases in experiments@xcite and simulations@xcite of vortex systems .",
