    "the use of these functionals implies that optimal controls can be identically @xmath20 on subsets of positive measure .",
    "this is referred to as sparsity .",
    "intuitively , the controls are switched off completely in intervals where , in the case smooth cost functionals were used , they would be small but nonzero . finite - dimensional , finite horizon , optimal control problems with nonsmooth penalizations in the control variable",
    "were originally studied in the context of the so - called _ minimum fuel optimal control problem _ , @xcite . in the linear case ,",

    "applications to sparse optimal control for multi - agent systems were addressed in @xcite .    for infinite - dimensional dynamics ,",
    "one of the areas of application for sparsity functionals is optimal actuator timing and placement @xcite .",
    "vanishing of the control in temporal or spatial regions indicates that it is not worthwhile to assert control force on the system there .",
    "such a type of information is not available from quadratic control penalties .",
    "open loop , finite horizon , optimal control problems with sparsity enhancing functionals in the context of partial differential equations were addressed in several papers in the recent past . here",
    "we can just mention only a few of them , see @xcite .",
    "the analysis in the present work is focused on the existence of solutions and the sparsity properties of infinite horizon optimal controls invoked by @xmath0 control penalties with @xmath1 .",

    "subsequently , first order optimality conditions are derived and the sparsity structure of optimal controls is investigated for both convex and nonconvex cases in section 5 . in @xcite control constraints of @xmath25 type are used , whereas we allow for @xmath26-constraints with @xmath27 .",

    ", we acknowledge that the numerical approximation of infinite horizon optimal control problems is a challenging task . in the open - loop context",
    ", the infinite horizon problem can be treated either by a sequential approximation of finite horizon control problems or via pseudospectral collocation methods @xcite . in the case of closed - loop optimal controls",
    ", there exists a solid computational framework based on the solution of the algebraic riccati equations for the linear quadratic case . for the more general case with nonlinear dynamics and nonquadratic costs ,",
    "computations can be carried out via dynamic programming .",
    "more precisely , we compute the value function associated to the control problem by solving a hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) equation , and then the optimal control and the associated optimal trajectories are reconstructed through an online feedback mapping which requires the solution of a nonlinear optimization problem . comparing the hjb approach to open - loop methods , it has the advantage of being in feedback form , yielding robust controllers in the presence of perturbations . in the hjb approach",
    "we are , of course , confronted with the so - called _ curse of dimensionality_. however , for low - dimensional dynamics , the design of numerical schemes is well - established ( we refer to ( * ? ? ? * chapter 8) for an updated introduction to this topic ) . in section 7 ,",
