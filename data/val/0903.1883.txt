    "the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , the sound oscillations of the primeval baryon - photon fluid prior to the recombination epoch , left their signature in the matter power spectrum @xcite .",
    "the bao signature in the galaxy clustering has recently attracted remarkable attention as a powerful probe for exploring the nature of the dark energy component commonly believed to be responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "the usefulness of the bao to constrain the dark energy has been demonstrated @xcite , and a lot of the bao survey projects are in progress or planned @xcite .",
    "the bao signature in the matter clustering plays a role of the standard ruler , because the characteristic scale of the bao is well understood within the cosmological linear perturbation theory as long as the adiabatic initial density perturbation is assumed .",
    "however , the comparison of the bao signature with observation is rather complicated .",
    "the observed galaxy power spectrum is contaminated by the nonlinear evolution of the density perturbations , the redshift - space distortions and the clustering bias .",
    "this enables us to use the galaxy power spectrum for other supplementary tests , in addition to the test of the expansion history of the universe for the equation of state of the dark energy .",
    "for example , the redshift - space distortions probe the linear growth rate of the density fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the growth rate is now recognized to be very important as the test of gravity on the cosmological scales .    in the paper @xcite ,",
    "some of the authors of the present paper investigated how the quasinonlinear density perturbations affect the bao signature .",
    "especially , we focused on the damping of the bao signature .",
    "the semianalytic investigation on the basis of the third - order perturbation theory demonstrated that the bao damping is sensitive to the growth factor @xmath0 and the amplitude of the matter power spectrum @xmath1 . here @xmath2 is the redshift and the growth factor is normalized as @xmath3 at @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the scale factor normalized as @xmath6 at the present epoch . as a result",
    ", a measurement of the bao damping might be useful as an additional consistency test by enabling one to probe the growth factor multiplied by the amplitude of the matter perturbation @xmath7 . in the present paper",
    ", we extend the previous work to include the redshift - space distortions , and confront the bao damping with the observed sdss lrg galaxy power spectrum . throughout this paper",
    ", we use units in which the velocity of light equals 1 , and adopt the hubble parameter @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "we start with reviewing the theoretical modeling of the bao damping .",
    "the bao signature is extracted from the matter power spectrum @xmath10 at redshift @xmath2 in the following manner , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the cosine of the angle between the line of sight direction and the wave number vector , and @xmath13 is the corresponding smooth spectrum without the bao . as will be explained in detail below , we adopt the formalism developed by matsubara @xcite for theoretical modeling of @xmath10 . the corresponding smooth spectrum @xmath13 is computed in the same manner as @xmath10 but with the no - wiggle transfer function in ref .",
