    "the theory of quantum measurement has been mired in controversy for the majority of its history . in a large part",
    "this is due to the philosophical difficulties , usually referred to as the `` quantum measurement problem , '' with which it is associated  @xcite .",
    "however , in most areas of physics it has been generally possible to ignore quantum measurement theory , because it was largely irrelevant to real measurements that were being made by experimentalists  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "if needed at all , an ensemble picture in which quantum measurement theory merely predicted average statistics provided a sufficient description .",
    "however , experimental technology has now advanced to the point where repeated measurements may be made on a _ single _ quantum system as it evolves  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "not only does quantum measurement theory become directly relevant to experimental physics , but we can consider testing the predictions of this theory regarding the effects of measurement on the single system itself .",
    "while the theory of quantum measurement is now widely accepted , some still remain unconvinced that the conditioned state describes what is really happening to an _ individual _ system when it is measured .",
    "how might we verify these predictions , and bring at least this part of the controversy to an end ?",
    "one way to do this is to attempt to perform feedback control on an individual quantum system @xcite .",
    "such an experiment involves taking into account the changes in the system due to the measurement results , and using this knowledge to alter inputs to the system in order to control its dynamics .",
    "this would therefore provide a direct verification of quantum measurement theory : if the feedback algorithm works , then the theory is correctly predicting the behavior of the system ; conversely , if the theory is not giving accurate predictions , the feedback algorithm will be ineffective .",
    "cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) is one area in which the motion of a single quantum system , an individual atom in an optical cavity , can be monitored experimentally in real time  @xcite .",
    "not only does the light emitted from the optical cavity provide a means to track the atomic motion , but the laser driving the cavity provides a means to apply forces to the atom .",
    "this system is therefore an excellent candidate for implementing real - time quantum feedback control .",
    "it is our purpose here to examine the implementation of such a process in this system , and to show that by using approximate estimation techniques , which will be essential in such experiments for the foreseeable future , a measurable degree of control over the atomic motion can be realized .",
    "in particular , we will simulate a control algorithm designed to cool the atomic motion .",
    "this might be referred to as `` active '' cooling ( control ) @xcite , as opposed to passive cooling schemes which have also been the focus of recent theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite work .    in general , feedback control of the atomic motional state",
    "requires the real - time estimation of the quantum state from the continuous measurement , thus providing the information needed to decide how the system should be perturbed to bring it to the target state .",
    "the theoretical tools required for obtaining this continuous estimate are those of continuous quantum measurement  @xcite .",
    "an estimate of the state of the quantum system ( in our case the motional state of the atom ) , conditioned continuously upon the results of measurement , is given by a stochastic master equation ( sme ) .",
    "the concept of an sme was first developed by belavkin in  @xcite ( as the quantum equivalent of the classical kushner - stratonovich equation ) , and a derivation of an sme in the language of quantum optics may be found in  @xcite . in principle",
    "the observer may calculate this state estimate by integrating the relevant sme using the measurement results , and from this determine the values of the inputs to the system to effect control .",
    "however , in practice the complexity of the sme will prevent the observer from calculating the state estimate in real time for systems where the dynamics are sufficiently fast , such as the atomic dynamics we consider here . as a result ,",
    "a simplified state - estimation procedure is essential .",
    "the theory of feedback control for classically observed linear systems is well developed  @xcite .",
    "this theory considers the optimality and robustness of feedback algorithms for given resources , and in some special cases may be applied directly to the control of quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "discussions of the application of classical feedback control techniques to quantum systems may be found in refs .",
    "however , for nonlinear control problems @xcite , such as that of the atomic motion we consider , no general results regarding the optimality of control algorithms exist as of yet . here",
    "we will be concerned with presenting simple control algorithms for cooling the atoms , and demonstrating that along with an approximate estimation algorithm , a substantial intervention into the dynamics of the atom using real - time feedback control should be achievable experimentally in the near future . in doing so",
    ", we build upon previous results @xcite by providing a detailed analysis of the cooling performance in this system , including its robustness to parameter variations and real - world limitations on computational speed and detection efficiency .",
    "furthermore , we are able to anticipate several difficulties in an experimental implementation and suggest solutions to overcome them",
    ".    owing to the computationally expensive nature of simulating an atom in an optical cavity , including the atomic motion in one dimension , supercomputers are invaluable for the task of evaluating the performance of the control algorithm over many realizations .",
    "this is the first time that full quantum simulations of such a cqed system , including the quantized , one - dimensional motion of the atom , have been performed .",
    "we are thus able to confirm the results of various approximations which have been used previously to provide a simplified analysis of this system  @xcite .",
    "the system we consider here is that of a two - level atom in a driven , single - mode optical cavity , where the output from the cavity is monitored using homodyne detection  @xcite . due to the continuous observation ,",
    "the evolution of the system is described by a stochastic master equation ( sme ) for the density operator , which can be written in it form as  @xcite @xmath0dt                 + \\gamma dt \\int_{-\\hbar k}^{\\hbar k } n(u )                      \\mathcal{d}[\\sigma e^{-iux/\\hbar}]\\rho \\ , du \\\\          & & \\displaystyle + \\kappa \\mathcal{d}[a]\\rho\\ , dt              + \\sqrt{\\eta\\kappa } \\mathcal{h}[a]\\rho\\ , dw ,    \\end{array }    \\label{sme}\\ ] ] where the hamiltonian is  @xcite @xmath1 and we have defined the superoperators @xmath2 $ ] and @xmath3 $ ] by @xmath4\\rho & { } : = { } & c\\rho c^\\dagger - \\frac{1}{2}(c^\\dagger c \\rho        + \\rho c^\\dagger c)\\\\      \\mathcal{h}[c]\\rho & { } : = { } & c\\rho + \\rho c^\\dagger - \\expct{c+c^\\dagger}\\rho     \\end{array}\\ ] ] for an arbitrary operator @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , the measured homodyne signal , given by @xmath6 continuously provides information about the optical phase shift due to the atom - cavity system and hence , as we will see below , information about the atomic position . in the above equations",
    ", @xmath7 is an operator representing the atomic position along the length of the cavity , @xmath8 is the conjugate momentum operator , @xmath9 is the annihilation operator for the cavity mode , and @xmath10 is the lowering operator for the atomic internal states .",
    "the energy loss rate of the cavity ( or equivalently , the full - width - at - half - maximum cavity transmission ) is @xmath11 , and @xmath12 gives the strength of the driving laser , and is related to the laser power @xmath13 by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the angular frequency of the laser light .",
    "we take the laser frequency to be resonant with the cavity mode .",
    "the laser angular wave number is given by @xmath16 , the decay rate of the atomic excited state is denoted by @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the cqed coupling constant between the atomic internal states and the cavity mode , and @xmath19 is the detuning between the atom and the cavity mode , given by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the atomic transition frequency .",
    "we will assume a positive ( red ) detuning , corresponding to a trapping optical potential . also , @xmath22 is the probability that the atomic momentum recoil along the @xmath7-direction is @xmath23 due to a spontaneous emission event , and @xmath24 is the differential of a stochastic wiener process . note that we have written the stochastic master equation in the interaction picture where the free oscillation of the light and the dipole rotation of the atom are implicit .",
    "the density operator @xmath25 obtained as a solution to the sme condenses our knowledge of the initial condition and the measurement record , allowing a prediction of the statistics of any future measurement on the system . as we show numerically in section  [ sec : estimation - cooling - dynamics ] , the solution to the equation is , generically , insensitive to the initial conditions except at very early times .",
    "we therefore refer to the solution of the sme as the observer s _ best estimate _ or _ state of knowledge _ of the quantum system .    in order to perform numerical calculations , it is sensible to choose units for position , momentum and time that are relevant for the corresponding scales of the system . when the detuning of the atom from the cavity is large compared to the cavity decay rate and the cqed coupling constant , both the internal atomic states and the cavity mode may be adiabatically eliminated , and in this case the atom sees an effective potential , given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "since this regime is the one in which we will be primarily interested , convenient units for @xmath7 and @xmath8 are given respectively by the width in position and momentum of the ground - state wave function in the harmonic approximation to one of the cosine wells . a convenient unit for time",
    "is set by the frequency of oscillation in the same harmonic potential .",
    "thus , given the three scales of the problem , @xmath28 we will use the scaled variables @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and we will measure time in units of @xmath31 .",
    "the sme for the density matrix may now be written as @xmath32dt + \\tilde{\\gamma } \\,dt                    \\int_{-\\tilde{k}}^{\\tilde{k } } n(\\tilde{u } )           \\mathcal{d}(\\sigma e^{-i\\tilde{u}x})\\rho \\ , d\\tilde{u } \\\\          & & + \\tilde{\\kappa } \\mathcal{d}[a]\\rho\\ , dt +               \\sqrt{\\eta\\tilde{\\kappa } } \\mathcal{h}[a]\\ , dw ,    \\label{scsme }    \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "the scaled rate constants @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are obtained from their absolute counterparts by dividing by @xmath38 .",
    "the scaled wave number is naturally @xmath39 .",
    "note that in these scaled units we have scaled @xmath40 out of the problem , so that @xmath41=i$ ] .",
    "while we will solve this equation numerically , it is nevertheless useful to examine the solutions obtained by adiabatically eliminating both the atomic internal states and the cavity mode , which is possible when the detuning @xmath42 is much larger than the coupling constant @xmath43 so that the excited atomic state is nearly unpopulated during the evolution @xcite . in this case",
    "the hamiltonian part of the evolution is governed by the effective hamiltonian @xmath44 thus , the atom moves in a sinusoidal potential , with period @xmath45 .",
    "the average height of the potential wells is essentially proportional to @xmath46 .",
    "it is therefore instructive to consider the cavity - mode dynamics , which determine the magnitude of the effective potential . under the effective hamiltonian ,",
    "the heisenberg equations of motion for the relevant cavity mode operators are @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the input quantum noise operator coming from the electromagnetic field outside the cavity , and satisfies @xmath49=\\delta(\\tau)$ ] .",
    "we can now identify a regime in which @xmath50 is large compared to @xmath51 . in this case",
    "the cavity mode damps quickly to a steady state , and we can approximate the solution by @xmath52^{-1 } ,   \\\\         & { } \\approx { } & \\displaystyle i\\alpha   - \\alpha \\left (                 \\frac{2\\tilde{g}^2}{\\tilde{\\delta}\\tilde{\\kappa } }                 \\right ) \\cos^2(\\tilde{k}x ) , \\\\",

    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] there will be fluctuations about these values due to the noise with a spectrum with a width of the order of @xmath50 .",
    "when @xmath11 ( or @xmath50 ) is sufficiently large , then @xmath53 , and the height of the potential will therefore be determined by the strength of the driving . as a consequence",
    ", one can manipulate the potential that the atom sees by changing the strength @xmath54 of the driving .",
    "the measured homodyne signal is given in the adiabatic approximation by @xmath55 where @xmath56 ; the position - information content of this signal is more clear in this form .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , in implementing feedback control , two considerations are paramount .",
    "the first is the ability to effectively track the evolution of the system in real time ( state estimation ) .",
    "the second is to provide an algorithm which determines how this information about the system should be used to alter the inputs to the system to effect control .",
    "we now consider these two questions in turn .",
    "the sme given in eq .",
    "( [ sme ] ) continuously provides the observer s best estimate of the state of the system from the information provided by the measurement record @xmath57 [ eq .  ( [ mr ] ) ] .",
    "therefore , it is possible , in principle , to use the measurement record to integrate the full sme to obtain a continuous state estimate .",
    "however , the resources required to do this in real time are prohibitive in practice .",
    "this is because the sme , being a partial stochastic differential equation , contains a large effective number of variables , and is almost impossible to integrate in real time , given that the time scale of the atomic motion is typically a few @xmath58s . as a result",
    ", we must obtain an estimation equation which contains only a small number of variables , but is nevertheless a good approximation to the full sme .    to obtain a compact system of estimation equations",
    ", we first note that initially gaussian states remain close to gaussian for a fairly large number of oscillations in a sufficiently strong sinusoidal potential .",
    "we thus make a gaussian approximation for the density matrix , which amounts to ignoring all cumulants higher than second order . in the present system , which effectively measures @xmath59",
    ", we expect this approximation to remain valid as long as the wave packet is much narrower than a single well ( @xmath60 ) , and the wave - packet momentum width is much larger than two photon recoils ( @xmath61 ) . to further simplify the estimation equations , we consider the sme after adiabatic elimination of the cavity and internal atomic degrees of freedom , given by @xmath62\\ , dt        + 2 \\gamma\\mathcal{d}[\\cos^2(\\kt x)]\\rho\\ , dt \\\\        & & \\displaystyle -\\sqrt{2\\eta\\gamma}\\mathcal{h}[\\cos^2(\\kt x)]\\rho\\ , dw ,    \\end{array }    \\label{adiabaticsme}\\ ] ] which gives a three - parameter model ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 ) . here",
    ", we have defined the effective hamiltonian @xmath66 where the maximum light shift @xmath67 is not an independent parameter in this static problem , but we will treat it as such when considering feedback via a time - dependent potential .",
    "we have also defined the effective measurement strength @xmath68 we further simplify the estimation model by making a gaussian ansatz for the density operator .",
    "the resulting estimation equations contain merely 5 variables : the estimated mean position and momentum ,   and , the estimated variances ,  and , and the estimated symmetrized covariance @xmath69 .",

    "the reconstructed `` wiener increment ''  arises by making the gaussian approximation to the photocurrent equation ( [ mradiab ] ) : @xmath75dt .\\ ] ] these estimation equations resemble stochastic differential equations , but it is important to recognize that  does not have the same statistics as the usual wiener increment @xmath24 .",
    "in particular , the reconstructed increment is the usual wiener increment with an extra deterministic component , @xmath76 dt ,    \\end{array }    \\label{dwefromdw}\\ ] ] which reflects the difference between the actual and estimated quantum states .",
    "this is the route by which the measurement information is incorporated into the estimator evolution .",
    "thus , these equations can not be treated by the usual high - order numerical methods for stochastic differential equations , which assume that the deterministic and stochastic parts of the differential equation can be explicitly separated .",
    "another important issue to note is that because the estimator only has information about @xmath77 , it can not tell us in which well the atom is located , and therefore , while feedback will allow us to cool an atom within a well , we can not know within _ which _ well the atom is confined .",
    "moreover , the estimator can not tell us on what side of a well the atom is located .",
    "note that this degeneracy is not a consequence of the gaussian approximation , but also applies to an observer using the full sme for estimation . as a consequence ,",
    "the estimator will show us the motion of the atom up to a phase factor of @xmath78 : the estimated state will either be in phase with the true motion , or completely out of phase , since these two motions are mirror images of one another .",
    "thus , for the feedback algorithm to be effective for every run , it is important that it works for both cases without change .",
    "the algorithms that we describe in the next section have this property .",
    "it is worth noting that the insensitivity of the feedback algorithm to the side of the well the atom is on has a potential advantage . in simulating the dynamics of the atom",
    ", we find that if the initial energy of the atom is large enough for it to move from one well to another , then as it does so the wave function tends to split across the interwell barrier , with part going back down into the original well , and part going down into an adjacent well . in this case",
    "the wave function is no longer gaussian , but consists of two or more  humps .",
    "\" however , even though the two humps are on opposite sides of their respective wells , they have approximately the same downward motion .",
    "thus , even though the estimator is gaussian , the fact that the humps are in different wells is immaterial to the measurement of @xmath79 , and the estimator effectively tracks the evolution of an `` equivalent '' quantum state localized within a single well in the sense of generating the same measurement record as the fragmented state . as a result , we can expect the gaussian estimator to continue to work even though the atom is distributed across more than one well .",
    "in order to perform the continuous estimation ( whether using the full sme or the above gaussian approximate estimator ) one chooses an initial state for the estimator that reflects the initial ignorance of the true quantum state and integrates the estimator equations using the measurement record as this record is obtained . in our case , when the atom is dropped into the cavity we have very little idea of where it is . it is therefore sensible to choose as the initial state for the estimator a gaussian broad enough to cover one side of a well , and centered somewhere on that side ( it is not important where precisely ) .",
    "we only need to include one side of the well in our initial uncertainty , since as mentioned above , both sides are equivalent from the point of view of the estimator . in practice , though , it is sufficient to pick a state with a much smaller uncertainty product , centered on one side of a potential well . even if this estimator state does not substantially overlap the actual quantum state , as we will see below",
    ", it will converge to the `` true '' state in a time of order @xmath80 as the measurement information is incorporated .      as discussed in section  [ thesys ] , it is possible to raise and lower the height of the potential by changing the input laser power .",
    "thinking of the atom as a classical particle , one would expect to be able to cool the atom using the following simple algorithm : when the atom is moving toward the center of the well , it is being accelerated by the potential , and so we can lower the laser power to reduce this acceleration . on the other hand",
    ", when the atom is moving away from the center of the well , then the potential decelerates the atom , and in this case we can increase the laser power so as to increase the deceleration . writing the optical field amplitude in the absence of feedback as @xmath12 , we will denote the value of the field during times when it is `` switched high '' as @xmath81 and the value when it is `` switched low '' as @xmath82 .",
    "thus the potential height will have the respective values @xmath83 and @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the unmodulated potential depth . in this way",
    ", we repeatedly switch the potential between a high value and a low value , which both slows the atom and moves it in towards center of the well , reducing the total energy and hence cooling the atom .",
    "this algorithm also has the nice property that all the information it requires is whether the atom is climbing or descending the well .",
    "therefore , the question of whether the estimated state is in phase or completely out of phase with the true motion is immaterial , since in both cases the relevant information is known .",
    "however , it turns out that this algorithm is not very effective at cooling the atomic motion , because while it does cool the centroid , it simultaneously feeds energy into the motion by squeezing the atomic wave function .",
    "a detailed discussion of this effect is given in appendix a. the result is that this simple centroid - only cooling algorithm is not adequate to cool the atom to the ground state .",
    "to do so we must develop a more sophisticated algorithm which can reduce the motional energy associated with the variances of the wave function .    to proceed , we consider the change in the motional energy due to time dependence of the optical - potential amplitude : @xmath86 it is clear from this expression that the `` bang - bang '' feedback strategy from the simple cooling algorithm , where the potential amplitude is switched cyclically and suddenly between two values , maximizes the energy extraction rate if we consider only algorithms with a cyclic modulation of the potential within that range .",
    "in fact , we should switch the potential low when the value of @xmath87 is maximized ( i.e. , the modulus is minimized ) , thus maximizing the energy extracted from the atom .",
    "then we should switch the potential high when @xmath87 is minimized , thus minimizing the energy transferred to the atom when completing the modulation cycle .",
    "when we must rely on the gaussian estimator to determine when to switch the potential , we switch the potential low or high when the estimated quantity @xmath88 is maximized or minimized , respectively .",
    "doing so involves an additional technical complication , however , since at any given instant , we must predict whether or not @xmath89 is an extremal value . to do this",
    "we dynamically fit a quadratic curve to a history of these values ( typically the last several hundred ) , and then trigger the feedback transitions on the slope of the fitted curve .",
    "this procedure is a convenient method for predicting the times when @xmath89 is maximized or minimized , and helps to reject the residual noise in the time evolution of this quantity .",
    "more formally , given a set of estimates @xmath90 corresponding to times @xmath91 , we implement the curve fit of the function @xmath92 to the last @xmath93 values of @xmath94 .",
    "we will defer the discussion of the computational efficiency of this algorithm until section [ section : speed ] .",
    "it may seem strange that this algorithm makes use of past state information , when all the necessary information should in principle be contained in the current estimate of the state .",
    "indeed , it is clear from the quantum bellman equation @xcite that the optimal control algorithm is given by only looking forward in time given the current state . in practice , such an algorithm is difficult to realize , and the present algorithm is likely suboptimal but robust and effective .",
    "we also note that since we are triggering in this algorithm on the estimated value of @xmath87 , it seems that it could be much simpler to simply trigger on the detector photocurrent @xmath95 , which from eq .",
    "( [ mradiab ] ) we know is a direct measure of this quantity plus noise .",
    "in fact , we can use the same curve - fitting procedure on @xmath95 to reject the noise on the signal .",
    "however , as we will see , this procedure does not work nearly as well as with the gaussian estimator , because the signal @xmath95 is noise - dominated , and the gaussian estimator acts as a nearly optimal filter for the useful information from this signal , in the same sense as a kalman filter @xcite .",
    "at this point , we can work out a simple theory of cooling for the improved cooling algorithm developed in the previous section .",
    "when we switch the optical potential low , the change in energy from eq .",
    "( [ coolingenergy ] ) is given by @xmath96 where we have taken @xmath97 , so that the potential amplitude is switched from @xmath98 to @xmath99 .",
    "when we switch high , the expression for the energy change is the same except for an overall minus sign .",
    "now we consider these expectation values for a particle very close to the ground state , and we will first consider the case where all the excess motional energy is associated with the motion of the wave - packet centroid .",
    "for the ground state itself , an equal part @xmath100 of the ground - state energy @xmath101 is associated with each of the kinetic and potential parts of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "if we define @xmath102 as the small , additional motional energy above the ground state , then as the displaced wave packet ( coherent state ) evolves in the nearly harmonic potential , the value @xmath103\\rangle$ ] of the potential part of the atomic energy oscillates between @xmath100 and @xmath104",
    ". then the best cooling that can be achieved for this state corresponds to two up and two down transitions per oscillation period ( which is unity in our scaled units ) . inserting these extremal values of @xmath105 into eq .",
    "( [ downtrans ] ) and the corresponding expression for upward transitions gives the cooling rate of @xmath106 per unit time .    in practice , the cooling algorithm switches more often than in this estimate due to noise on the signal",
    "however , in such cases we might still expect that eq .",
    "( [ coolingrate ] ) is a reasonable estimate for the cooling rate .",
    "even though the potential is switched more often , the switches are caused by noise and thus do not occur at optimal moments in time .",
    "thus the amount of cooling per switching cycle is reduced , and we observe that the net cooling effect per unit time is near the optimal rate of eq .",
    "( [ coolingrate ] ) , presumably because the cooling algorithm is not too sensitive to the noise .",
    "if we then assume that heating due to spontaneous emission is negligible compared to measurement heating , then the steady - state motional energy is obtained when the cooling rate in eq .",
    "( [ coolingrate ] ) balances the heating rate which we derive in appendix  [ heating ] ( eq .",
    "( [ measurementheating ] ) ) .",
    "this gives the steady - state energy @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",
    "the other extreme case we will consider is where the motional energy in excess of the ground - state energy is associated purely with squeezing of the wave packet and not with the centroid . in this case ,",
    "@xmath109 oscillates between the values @xmath110 , giving the cooling rate of @xmath111 per unit time .",
    "then the condition that this cooling rate balances the heating rate in eq .",
    "( [ measurementheating ] ) implies @xmath112 for the steady - state energy .",
    "but in the regime where these theories are valid ( i.e. , @xmath113 or @xmath114 ) , the centroid result of eq .",
    "( [ e0ss ] ) is always larger than the squeezing result of eq .",
    "( [ e0ssvar ] ) .",
    "thus , we expect that the centroid limit [ eq .",
    "( [ e0ss ] ) ] is the more appropriate cooling limit .",
    "( [ e0ss ] ) predicts that the atomic motion will cool essentially to the ground state so long as @xmath115 .",
    "thus , as various parameters are changed , there are `` border '' values that divide the parameter space according to whether or not the atomic motion is cooled to the ground state .",
    "for example , the atom will cool to nearly the ground state so long as the `` bang amplitude '' @xmath116 is larger than the border value @xmath117 otherwise , the steady - state energy should be substantially higher , and the atomic motion may not even cool at all . however ,",

    "for a typical cooling simulation with the canonical parameters , the estimator must be reset in about 95% of the trajectories , with trajectories on average requiring 3 resets due to the area condition ( the other conditions producing negligible numbers of resets in comparison ) .",

    "here we analyze the effect of the simple centroid - only feedback cooling algorithm described in section  [ section : alg ] .",
    "this involves switching the optical potential to a high value when the atom is climbing a potential well , and switching it to a low value when it is falling .",
    "recall that the value of the `` switched high '' field is @xmath81 and the `` switched low '' field is @xmath82 , so that the potential height has the corresponding values @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( @xmath12 and @xmath85 are the respective unmodulated values ) .    since the feedback algorithm involves more than simply driving the system with an external force , to understand the action of the algorithm one must analyze its effect both on the means ( the centroid ) and the variances of the atomic position and momentum .",
    "the effect on the centroid is to damp the motion . in one cooling cycle ,",
    "the energy of the centroid is multiplied by a `` cooling factor , '' @xmath246 which is valid in the harmonic approximation .",
    "the effect on the variances is , however , to squeeze the atomic wave function . to understand why this is the case ,",

    "this changes the frequency of the effective harmonic oscillator governing the atomic motion , and as a consequence , a wave function that was not squeezed in the phase space of the old harmonic oscillator , is squeezed in the space of the new one .",
    "in particular , raising the height of the potential scales phase space so that momentum is squeezed , and conversely lowering the potential squeezes position . to determine the rate of squeezing , it is useful to consider what happens in one `` cooling cycle . '' for example , we may define the cooling cycle to start when the atom crosses the bottom of the well , and end when the atom again crosses the bottom of the well traveling in the original direction ( essentially one period of oscillation ) .",
    "examining the effect of each of the changes in the potential during a cooling cycle , we find that the result of a single cycle is to multiply the momentum variance of the atomic wave function by a `` magnification factor , '' @xmath247 in the harmonic approximation .",
    "this factor is precisely the inverse of the cooling factor @xmath248 .",
    "this situation is analogous to an attempt to cool a classical ensemble of particles using a control algorithm designed for a single particle ; although the algorithm will cool a single particle , it will almost certainly heat the other members of the ensemble .",
    "this will be an important consideration in designing an improved feedback algorithm .",
    "a simulation of this simple feedback algorithm is given in figure  [ fig : basiccooling ] .",
    "this shows that after a few cooling cycles in which the total energy is initially reduced , the resulting squeezing overtakes the cooling of the centroid , and the algorithm actually heats the atomic motion .",
    "_ * spontaneous emission . * _ spontaneous emission events kick the atom in both directions , and therefore cause momentum diffusion . the effect of this is to increase the energy , on average , linearly with time .",
    "this rate depends both upon the spontaneous - emission rate as well as the magnitude of the associated kicks .",
    "one point to note is that the magnitude of each kick is not merely determined by the momentum of the emitted photon , but also by the difference between the momentum of the excited and ground state wave functions .",
    "more precisely , we can factor the atomic state vector   just before a spontaneous - emission event into a product of internal and motional states , @xmath249 where @xmath250  are states in the center - of - mass space of the atom , and `` e '' and `` g '' denote excited and ground atomic energy levels , respectively . then in an unraveling of the master equation ( [ sme ] ) where the spontaneously emitted photons are detected but do not give position information about the atom , the one - dimensional atomic state just after a spontaneous - emission event is just the previous state with the internal state lowered and a momentum - recoil factor , @xmath251 where the random variable @xmath252 is chosen from the projected angular distribution of the resonance fluorescence @xmath253 referred to in the sme ( [ scsme ] ) .",
    "thus , in addition to the emission momentum recoil , the spontaneous emission effectively converts the atomic state from the ground state wave function to the excited state wave function . in the regime where the adiabatic approximation is valid",
    ", we have the relation @xmath254 and thus we can interpret this extra process as being simply another momentum kick due to the absorption of a cavity photon ( i.e. , a superposition of a photon - recoil kick in either direction along the cavity axis ) .",
    "the actual rate of spontaneous emissions may be estimated by multiplying the spontaneous emission rate by the average excited state population , giving @xmath255 for an atom localized at a field antinode . calculating this for the conditions that we use in the numerical simulations in the body of the text",

    "note that although we attribute this heating to measurement back - action , an equivalent , measurement - independent picture for this heating process is the cavity decay process .",
