    "the increase of the lep centre - of - mass energy well above the w boson pair - production threshold opens the possibility of studying the triple boson production process @xmath0 .",
    "we report on the cross section measurement of this inclusive process where the photon lies inside a defined phase space region .",
    "the three boson final state gives access to quartic gauge boson couplings represented by four - boson interaction vertices as shown in figure  [ fey]a . at the lep centre - of - mass energies the contribution of four - boson vertex diagrams , predicted by the standard model of electroweak interactions  @xcite , are negligible with respect to the other competing diagrams , mainly initial - state radiation .",
    "the study of the process is thus sensitive to anomalous quartic gauge couplings ( aqgc ) in both the @xmath6 and @xmath7 vertices .",
    "the presence of aqgc would increase the cross section and modify the photon energy spectrum of the process .",
    "this search is performed within the theoretical framework of references   and  .",
    "the existence of aqgc would also affect the @xmath8 process via the @xmath9 fusion diagram , shown in figure  [ fey]b , containing the @xmath7 vertex  @xcite .",
    "the reaction @xmath10 is dominated by initial - state radiation whereas the quartic standard model contribution from the @xmath9 fusion is negligible at lep .",
    "also in this case the presence of aqgc would enhance the production rate , especially for the hard tail of the photon energy distribution and for photons produced at large angles with respect to the beam direction .",
    "the results are based on the high energy data sample collected with the l3 detector  @xcite .",
    "data at the centre - of - mass energy of @xmath11 , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 176.8  pb@xmath1 , were already analysed  @xcite and are used in the aqgc analysis . in the following , particular emphasis is given to the additional luminosity of 427.4  pb@xmath1 recorded at centre - of - mass energies ranging from @xmath12 up to @xmath3 .",
    "the results derived on aqgc from the and channels are eventually combined .",
    "studies of triple gauge bosons production and aqgc were recently reported for both the @xmath4  @xcite and @xmath13  @xcite final states .",
    "the dominant contributions to the @xmath4 final state come from the radiative graphs with photons emitted by the incoming particles ( isr ) , by the decay products of the w bosons ( fsr ) or by the w s themselves ( wsr ) .    in this study ,",
    "the signal is defined as the phase space region of the @xmath0 process where the photon fulfills the following criteria :    * @xmath14 5 gev , where @xmath15 is the energy of the photon , * @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the angle between the photon and the beam axis , * @xmath18 20@xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the angle between the direction of the photon and that of the closest charged fermion .",
    "these requirements , used to enhance the effect of possible aqgc , largely contribute to avoid infrared and collinear singularities in the calculation of the signal cross section .    in order to study efficiencies , background contaminations and aqgc effects ,",
    "several monte carlo programs are used .    the @xcite generator , which does not include either the quartic coupling diagrams or the wsr , performs initial state multi - photon radiation in the full photon phase space . fsr from charged leptons in the event up to double bremsstrahlung",
    "is included using the photos  @xcite package .",
    "the jetset  @xcite monte carlo program , which includes photons in the parton shower , is used to model the fragmentation and hadronization process .",
    "the  program is used in the analysis for the determination of efficiencies .",
    "pythia  @xcite is used to simulate the background processes : @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the  @xcite program is used to simulate the effect of aqgc .",
    "it includes @xmath24 calculations for visible photons but is lacking the simulation of photons collinear to the beam pipe and of fsr .",
    "the net effect of collinear photons , included by implementing the @xcite collinear radiator function , is to move the effective centre - of - mass energy towards lower values , reducing the expected signal cross section by about 18% .",
    "other monte carlo programs which include wsr or full @xmath25 corrections , such as  @xcite and  @xcite , are used to cross check the calculations .    for the simulation of the @xmath10 process in the framework of the standard model the koralz  @xcite monte carlo generator is used .",
    "nunugpv @xcite is also used to cross check the results , and found to be in agreement with koralz .",
    "the effects of aqgc are simulated using the eenunuggano program  @xcite .",
    "the missing higher order corrections due to isr in eenunuggano are also estimated by implementing the excalibur collinear radiator function .",
    "the response of the l3 detector is modelled with the geant  @xcite detector simulation program which includes the effects of energy loss , multiple scattering and showering in the detector materials and in the beam pipe .",
    "time dependent detector inefficiencies are taken into account in the simulation .",
    "the selection of @xmath4 events follows two steps : first semileptonic @xmath26 or qq@xmath27 , and fully hadronic @xmath28 events are selected  @xcite , then a search for isolated photons is performed .",
    "the photon identification in @xmath9 events is optimized for each four - fermion final state .",
    "photons are identified from energy clusters in the electromagnetic calorimeter not associated with any track in the central detector and with low activity in the nearby region of the hadron calorimeter .",
    "the profile of the shower must be consistent with that of an electromagnetic particle .",
    "experimental cuts on photon energy and angles are applied , reflecting the phase space definition of the signal .",
    "figure  [ spec189 ] shows the distributions of @xmath15 , @xmath17 , and @xmath20 for the full data set , including the data at @xmath11 . here",
    ", @xmath20 is defined as the angle of the photon with respect to the closest identified lepton or hadronic jet .",
    "good agreement between data and standard model expectations is observed .",

    "table  [ tab : wwg ] summarizes the selection yield . in total 86 @xmath4 candidate events",
    "are selected at @xmath31 .",
    "the standard model expectation , inside the specified phase space region , is of @xmath32 events .    the quantity @xmath33 , representing the selection efficiencies for the @xmath34  qql@xmath35 and qqqq decay modes , ranges from 70% to 87% .",
    "the quantity @xmath36 is the photon identification efficiency inside the selected phase space region .",
    "this efficiency takes into account small effects of events migrating from outside the signal region into the selected sample due to the finite detector resolution .",
    "its value ranges from 52% to 80% , the lowest efficiencies being obtained in the fully hadronic sample where the high multiplicity makes the photon identification more difficult .",
    "the overall selection efficiency @xmath37 is around 45% for all final states .",
    "the @xmath4 cross sections are evaluated channel by channel and then combined according to the standard model w boson branching fractions .",
    "the data samples at @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are respectively merged .",
    "they correspond to the luminosity averaged centre - of - mass energies and to the integrated luminosities listed in table  [ tab : wwg ] .",
    "the results , including the published value at @xmath41  @xcite , are : @xmath42 where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic .",
    "the measurements are in good agreement with the standard model expectations , @xmath43 , calculated using  and reported with a theoretical uncertainty of 5%  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : xsec ] shows these results together with the predicted total @xmath4 cross sections as a function of the centre - of - mass energy .",
    "the ratio between the measured cross section @xmath44 and the theoretical expectations is derived at each centre - of - mass energy .",
    "these values are then combined as : @xmath45 where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic .",
    "the systematic uncertainties arising in the inclusive w - pair event selections  @xcite are propagated to the final measurement and correspond to an uncertainty of 0.008 pb for all the energy points .",
    "additional systematic uncertainties due to the electromagnetic calorimeter resolution and energy scale are found to be negligible .",
    "the total systematic uncertainty is dominated by the jetset modelling of photons from meson decays ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "its effect has been directly studied on data  @xcite comparing the photon rate in @xmath47 events with monte carlo simulations .",
    "a correction factor of @xmath48 is applied to the rate of photons in the monte carlo simulation and its uncertainty is propagated .",
    "this uncertainty , fully correlated among the data taking periods , amounts to 6  % of the measured cross section .",
    "in the framework of references   and  , the standard model lagrangian of electroweak interactions is extended to include dimension-6 operators proportional to the three aqgc : @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where @xmath52 represents the energy scale for new physics .    the two parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which are separately c and p conserving , generate anomalous @xmath7 and @xmath53 vertices .",
    "the term @xmath51 , which is cp violating , gives rise to an anomalous contribution to the @xmath6 vertex .",
    "indirect limits on @xmath49 and @xmath50 were derived  @xcite , but only the study of @xmath4 events allows for a direct measurement of the anomalous coupling @xmath51 .",
    "these couplings would manifest themselves by modifying the energy spectrum of the photons and the total cross section as shown in figures  [ fig : sele ] and  [ fig : xsec ] , respectively .",
    "the effect increases with increasing centre - of - mass energy .",
    "these predictions are obtained by reweighting the  monte carlo events by the ratio of the differential distributions as calculated by the  and  programs  @xcite .",
    "the derivation of aqgc is performed by fitting both the shape and the normalization of the photon energy spectrum in the range from 5  to 35 .",
    "each of the aqgc is varied in turn fixing the other two to zero .",
    "the combination of all data , including the results at @xmath54  @xcite , gives : a_0/^2 & = & 0.0000.010 ^-2 + a_c/^2 & = & - 0.0130.023 ^-2 + a_n/^2 & = & -0.0020.076 ^-2 where systematic uncertainties are included .    at the 95% confidence level",
    ", the aqgc are constrained to : @xmath55 all these results are in agreement with the standard model expectation .",
    "the sign of the @xmath56 and @xmath57 aqgc , obtained with the  reweighting , is reversed according to the discussions in references   and .",
    "the sensitivity of the @xmath10 process to the @xmath49 and @xmath58 aqgc , through the diagrams shown in figure  [ fey]b , is also exploited .",
    "events with an acoplanar multi - photon signature are selected  @xcite . in this letter",
    "we report on results from data at @xmath59 .",
    "figure  [ fig : recmass ] shows the two - photon recoil mass , @xmath60 , distribution , with the predicted aqgc signal for a non - zero anomalous coupling @xmath49 .",
    "the number of selected events in the z peak region , defined as @xmath61 , is 43 in agreement with the standard model expectation of @xmath62 .",
    "the aqgc signal prediction is reliable only for recoil masses lower than the mass of the z boson as the interference with the standard model processes is not included in the calculation . requiring @xmath63 ,",
    "no event is retained by the selection in agreement with the standard model expectation of @xmath64 events .",
