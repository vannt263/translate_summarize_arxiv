    "extended emission - line regions are a characteristic feature of the brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) in many galaxy clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these nebulae often have filamentary structures and may reach to tens of kiloparsecs from the galaxy center .",
    "their spectra feature strong low - ionization emission lines , similar to those from the low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liners ) that are observed in many galaxy nuclei @xcite .    bcgs are giant elliptical galaxies , and commonly cd galaxies with extended stellar envelopes .",
    "they are the most luminous and most massive of the cluster galaxies and are located at , or close to , the gravitational center of the host cluster .",
    "this position contributes to a rich history of accretion and mergers , and also means they are permeated by the densest , x - ray - emitting gas of the icm and may be the destination of any material cooling from this medium .    in cooling - flow , or cool - core ,",
    "clusters the x - ray surface brightness profile has a strong central peak , indicating a core of high density and reduced temperature .",
    "the cooling time in this core is short relative to the lifetime of the cluster , so there is the potential for massive cooling flows to have formed @xcite .",
    "however , x - ray spectroscopy has shown that most of the gas cooling is being offset by some source of heating in the core .",
    "this source is not certainly associated with the activity of the central galaxy , but episodic outbursts of radiative and mechanical energy from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in the bcgs are currently the favored heating mechanism ( e.g. , see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the line - emitting filaments that surround many bcgs may be symptoms of the interactions between the cooling cluster gas and the sources of mass and energy feedback in the central galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "as such , cluster cores are effective places to study feedback in nearby galaxies , through the excitation , kinematics , and origins of the nebulae .",
    "observations reveal clear links between the extended emission - line regions and their environment .",
    "bcgs are more likely to host extended emission - line nebulae when they are situated close to the x - ray center of a strongly cooling cluster core @xcite . in addition ,",
    "bcgs that host more luminous emission - line systems tend to be found in more luminous x - ray cluster cores with higher central cooling rates @xcite , are generally associated with larger masses of cold gas @xcite , and have higher rates of star formation @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the presence , or excitation , of the extended nebulae in cooling - flow bcgs is directly related to the cooling gas in the cluster core .",
    "observational results also highlight a connection between agn output , star formation , and gas cooling in bcg environments .",
    "for example , there appears to be a minimum threshold in central x - ray cooling rate that is required for the onset of both nuclear activity and star formation in bcgs @xcite .",
    "models of episodic agn heating and feedback provide at least a qualitative explanation for how the heating and regulation of cooling flows may occur ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paradigm",
    "the bcg and its environment experiences cyclic episodes of cooling and inflow that feed nuclear activity , and heating and outflow powered by the agn . in the cold feedback model described by @xcite ,",
    "feedback occurs throughout the cool inner region of a cluster core ( over radii of @xmath3kpc ) .",
    "an outburst from the agn in the central galaxy ejects a large amount of energy into the surrounding medium .",
    "bipolar jets form and drive expanding plumes of hot , radio - emitting plasma that rise buoyantly in the cluster atmosphere .",
    "these interact with the surrounding galaxy and environment , and displace and heat the cooling cluster gas ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review of agn heating mechanisms ) .",
    "this heating slows fuel supply to the agn and as outflow activity decreases , material in the cluster core begins to cool .",
    "clumps that become sufficiently dense fall inwards and , with some initial angular momentum , may form an accretion disk .",
    "this produces a reservoir of cold gas in the galaxy ; some of the cooling material contributes to star formation , and some is accreted into the black hole .",
    "a large mass of accreting material will trigger another burst of nuclear activity and continue the feedback cycle .",
    "@xcite suggest that the diversity of properties of the multi - wavelength emission from cluster cores might be explained , at least in part , because they are observed at different phases of such feedback cycles .",
    "they discuss several bcg systems and propose that one is in an early cooling phase : having gas motions in the filaments consistent with free - fall into the galaxy , weak radio emission and a strong x - ray cooling rate .",
    "they place two others , hosting stronger and more extensive radio sources , in post - agn outburst phases . such studies of the multi - phase gas surrounding bcgs , particularly including integral - field spectroscopic data that provide kinematic information about the emission - line regions , will help us to understand which , if any , properties of the extended emission systems are evidence of feedback activity .",
    "further , this may allow us to definitively place individual bcg systems within the sequence of a heating / cooling cycle , and potentially to constrain the physics of feedback models in clusters .",
    "we have previously presented a deep , integral - field spectroscopic study of ngc  4696 , the central galaxy of the centaurus cluster , that provided a detailed picture of the kinematics of the central emission - line filaments @xcite .",
    "this system may be in a period of accretion , following the infall of a small cluster galaxy .",
    "we found that models of @xmath4200  kms@xmath2 shocks , propagating through pre - ionized , dense clouds , can reproduce the optical emission - line spectrum .",
    "the results also emphasize that mergers and galaxy interactions are an important component of the activity in cooling - flow bcg nebulae .    here , we study a small sample of other low- and intermediate - luminosity cooling - flow bcg filament systems .",
    "these are the first optical integral - field spectroscopy of the nebulae surrounding the bcg of a3581 and sersic159 - 03 , and the first to cover the full extent of the emission - line regions in that of 2a0335 + 096 .",
    "we investigate the kinematic and excitation properties of the optical emission surrounding the galaxies and combine our results with those of studies at x - ray and radio frequencies to make inferences about the state of feedback activity in these systems .    throughout this study",
    "we adopt the cosmological parameters @xmath5kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , based on the five - year _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( _ wmap _ ) results @xcite .",

    "they also proposed that the filamentary nebula has been uplifted from the central galaxy by the radio lobes , but that gas in the filaments is now largely removed from the impact of the radio jet and is cooling and forming stars .",
    "the galaxies were observed with the wide - field spectrograph ( wifes ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and the australian national university ( anu ) 2.3 m telescope at siding spring observatory .",

    "table  [ tab : obs ] shows the total integration times obtained for each galaxy and other details of the observations .",
    "each set of four galaxy frames and one sky frame was preceded and followed by an observation of a spectrophotometric standard star and these were used to calibrate the absolute flux scale of the observations .",
    "dwarf stars with spectra that resemble a featureless blackbody were also measured during the night and used to remove atmospheric absorption features from the flux standard star and galaxy spectra .",
    "cu - ar and ne - ar arc calibration lamp frames , for wavelength calibration , were observed regularly during each night , and quartz - iodine lamp flat - field frames were observed at the beginning of each night .",
    "twilight sky flat - field frames were obtained on most nights , so that those used in processing an image were never obtained more than two nights from that observation .",
    "the data were reduced using iraf data - reduction scripts for wifes @xcite that are based on and directly employ scripts from the gemini iraf package .",
    "the process of data reduction applied to these data is similar to that described in @xcite , to which we refer the reader for a more detailed description , but differs in several points that are outlined below .",
    "a slightly different method was employed to remove the detector bias level from the images .",
    "subtracting the bias signal is complicated both by detectors that are read out through four separate amplifiers , producing a different bias level in the four quadrants of each image , and by a residual shape that is present in the bias level across the detectors .",
    "these were removed using polynomial fits to the bias signal across unexposed rows on each amplifier in addition to the overscan columns .    a second - order correction for extinction in the earth s atmosphere",
    "is also included in the flux calibration for these data .",
    "we estimate that the resulting absolute flux scale is accurate to approximately 11% .    also , for these data a correction for differential atmospheric refraction was made in software after constructing the data cubes , using routines from the starlink positional astronomy library slalib in iraf .    the average rms error in the wavelength calibration is @xmath38 for the red cubes and @xmath39 for the blue cubes .",
    "line - of - sight velocities are presented relative to the local standard of rest , as the corrections for the relative velocities of the sources during the observations were smaller than the spectral resolution of the data .    after forming the individual data cubes for each exposure ,",
    "the pixels were binned by two in the spatial direction along the slitlets , to form square 1@xmath361 pixels .",
    "this improves the signal - to - noise ratio and provides a spatial pixel scale that is better suited to the typical seeing during the observations ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "several exposures of a3581 and 2a0335 + 096 were obtained with the field oriented at a different position angle ( pa ) to the majority of the observations .",
    "the binned cubes were rotated to the intended position angle using the iraf rotate task , interpolating the pixels linearly .",
    "the position angles for the combined data cubes are provided in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the individually - reduced science cubes were median - combined after applying spatial offsets to align the dithered observations .",
    "these offsets were derived from the continuum centroid of the galaxy nucleus , measured in an image close to the center of the spectrum in a region that is free of line emission .",
    "cosmic rays and bad pixels were also removed by combining the data cubes in this way .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : intspec ] , there is a strong contribution to the bcg spectra from the stellar component of the elliptical galaxies . in the central regions of the galaxies ,",
    "the spectrum of each is dominated by this emission , which must be removed to accurately measure the nebular emission lines .    for a3581 ,",
    "this was done using a spectrum extracted from within the data cube itself , since line emission is not observed in all regions spatially across the galaxy .",
    "we extracted an integrated continuum template spectrum from a position 8 north and 5 west of the continuum peak , within a 4-diameter aperture .",
    "we could not extract a template galaxy continuum spectrum from within the sersic159 - 03 and 2a0335 + 096 data cubes that was free of line emission and had sufficient continuum signal to be useful in removing the galaxy continuum . in these cases , we formed a galaxy continuum template spectrum from previous wifes observations of the giant elliptical galaxy ngc  4696 .",
    "an integrated spectrum was extracted from a region of high galaxy signal and the line emission was removed using the gaussian line - profile fits to the emission in the continuum - subtracted ngc  4696 cubes as described in @xcite .",
    "this spectrum was then interpolated onto a redshifted wavelength scale for each of the galaxies to form a continuum template spectrum .    for each of the emission lines of interest , in each spatial pixel",
    "the template spectrum was scaled to match the flux level of a continuum region close to the line and then subtracted .",

    "the spectra are extracted from a @xmath41-diameter aperture located at the galaxy nucleus , as defined by the peak of the continuum emission .    employing continuum template spectra from the wifes data",
    "was the most straightforward option for removing the stellar continuum , and provides satisfactory results since the continuum shape is similar in each of these galaxies .",

    "the line - profile models consist of one or more gaussian functions plus a linear continuum baseline to remove any residual continuum level and slope .",

    "this is estimated by measuring the integrated h@xmath8 and h@xmath44 emission - line fluxes over a region of the inner , bright filaments in each galaxy ( excluding the nuclear region ) where the signal - to - noise ratio of both hydrogen lines is greater than five , and obtaining a mean extinction value from the integrated flux ratio .",

    "there is insufficient signal in the h@xmath44 emission to fit the multiple kinematic components that are seen in the strong h@xmath8 and [ ] emission lines . in particular , in the galaxy core , a low - amplitude but very broad emission - line component provides a good fit to the wings of the strong line profiles , and contains a significant amount of flux .",
    "we were unable to fit this component in the fainter h@xmath44 line profiles , and as a result would overestimate the values of the hydrogen flux ratio in the core . for this reason , we apply the mean extinction level from the filaments ( @xmath50 ) , as explained above , to the fluxes in pixels within a radius of 3 in the a3581 data cubes .",
    "uncertainties in the relative line - flux measurements were estimated using the noise properties of the spectra after continuum subtraction . for a given emission line , the 1@xmath51 error in the flux density per pixel was taken to be the standard deviation in a line - free region adjacent to the feature .",

    "the kinematics and the morphologies of the ionized gas and the radio emission suggest that the two components are interacting .",
    "the shape of the optical emission regions , forming bipolar structures that surround the radio lobes , suggests a component of outflow in the nebula that is generated by the expanding lobes .",
    "given the coincidence between several clumps of line - emitting gas and bends in the orientation of the radio lobes , we conclude that there is significant interaction between the structures .",
    "the gas with low line - of - sight velocities that surrounds the outer sides and edges of the radio bubbles has oppositely - directed velocities at the east and west ends of the nebula , and so is probably gas that is being displaced and pushed outwards from the galaxy by the expansion of the lobes .",
    "the distortion of the radio lobes implies that the radio structures are also perturbed by the presence of cold , dense gas in their path .",
    "we suggest it is most likely that the radio lobes and cooling optical nebula mutually affect one another as the lobes expand , since there is evidence for both possible inflow and outflow motions in the nebula ; the radio lobes are driving out gas in the outer filaments , while there may be gas infalling along the inner , bright spiral filament .",
    "the structure of the radio source , the x - ray cavities , and the morphology and kinematics that we have observed in the optical nebula reveal the system to be in a well - developed stage of agn outflow and heating .",
    "the radio source is not overly luminous , but there is significant interaction between the radio outflows and the surrounding environment .",
    "there is evidence for infall and accretion occurring from the line - emitting nebulae , which may be remnant flows that are feeding the current nuclear activity .",
    "it appears that we are observing a phase of feedback activity in which agn heating balances and possibly dominates the cooling of gas from the icm .    in 2a0335 + 096 , there is no indication of a strong interaction between the optical and radio - emitting structures .",
    "the filaments to the east and west have some spatial association with the radio bubbles : the lobes are coincident with low surface - brightness regions of the nebula , and there are faint filaments that outline the edges of these cavities .",
    "it is possible that some of this emitting gas has been entrained by the expansion of the lobes to their current positions .",
    "however , most of the emission - line gas in the system appears to be unrelated to the weak radio lobes in this galaxy . in particular ,",
    "the large - scale bar of ionized gas that dominates the structure is not associated with any detected radio emission .",
    "@xcite estimate that the total enthalpy associated with the five x - ray cavities that they detect in 2a0335 + 096 is approximately @xmath107 erg .",
    "the cooling luminosity from within the 120kpc cooling radius of the cluster is approximately @xmath108  ergs@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "therefore , they note that if the average cooling rate is uniform over time , the estimated enthalpy of the cavities would be sufficient to balance the icm cooling for only @xmath109yr .",
    "the current radio source is estimated to have an age similar to this timescale @xcite , and estimates of the average time between outbursts in cooling - flow clusters are closer to @xmath110yr @xcite .",
    "given the evidence for a number of episodes of agn activity that have produced the observed cavities , the heating has clearly occurred intermittently over a significantly longer timescale than @xmath111 yr : at least the length of several agn outburst cycles .",
    "thus , for a significant fraction of the time the core must have been dominated by cooling , and it currently appears to be in such a phase of strong cooling and accretion activity .",
    "the structure and kinematics of the optical emission also provide evidence for material forming a rotating disk - like configuration in the outer nebula , possibly being accreted from the cooling gas of the icm .",
    "there is a large mass of cool material associated with the extended filaments .",
    "co emission - line measurements imply that there is @xmath61@xmath15 of molecular material within 30kpc of the bcg @xcite .",
    "it appears that cooling activity dominates in the core of 2a0335 + 096 and the energy output from the radio source is insufficient to balance the icm cooling at the current time .",
    "the radio outflows appear to have relatively little influence on the emission - line nebula , and we suggest that we are observing a system in a strongly cooling phase of feedback .    the data for sersic159 - 03 are more difficult to interpret .",
    "we can not discount an interaction between the optical filaments and radio outflows , but do not see clear evidence for it in our data .",
    "@xcite argue that there has been a strong interaction between the agn outflows and optical - line - emitting filaments .",
    "they propose that the material in the north and west filaments has been uplifted from the central galaxy by an expanding radio outflow , and assisted in reaching the current position relative to the galaxy by the southward motion of the bcg through the cluster atmosphere .",
    "the bcg is located approximately 8(8.6kpc ) south of the cluster x - ray emission peak @xcite and has a redshift of @xmath112  kms@xmath2 relative to the cluster center .",
    "this interpretation is supported by metallicities and temperatures measured in the clumpy x - ray emission aligned with the optical filament that are lower than in the surrounding icm . in addition , they find that the core of the cluster is largely devoid of the densest x - ray emitting icm within @xmath113kpc , which has presumably been evacuated by the agn outflows .    however , there is not a strong relationship between the distribution of the optical line emission and the radio lobe structures that are observed .",
    "the western filament , in particular , is quite separate from the radio emission and seems unlikely to have been affected by the radio outflow activity .",
    "our data indicate that the kinematics of the northern filament are equally consistent with inflowing velocities along the structure as with outflow , and we suggest that the material in the filament could be part of an accretion flow into the central galaxy .",
    "the kinematics of the material in the filament are consistent with a flow that smoothly joins the rotation seen in gas close to the core .",
    "the filament material may have been uplifted by outflows associated with an earlier episode of agn activity , have since had time to cool , and is now falling into the central galaxy , potentially fueling renewed agn activity represented by the high - frequency inner radio lobes .",
    "it is clear that the central agn has had a significant effect on the surrounding icm .",
    "so although the kinematics of the optical emission - line regions do not assist in a definitive interpretation of the behavior of the material in the nebula , it is likely that we are observing this system in an agn - dominated phase of feedback .    to summarise , in a3581 the structure of the nebula",
    "is closely related to the radio outflows and it seems clear that agn feedback at least offsets most of the core cluster cooling in the observed phase of activity . in 2a0335 + 096",
    "there is evidence for minor interactions between the emission - line gas and radio lobes , but predominantly the nebula is not affected by the agn output , and accretion and cooling activity dominates .",
    "sersic159 - 03 shows evidence for agn activity that has had a strong influence on the cluster core , and may have affected the cooling material in the nebula , particularly the northern filaments , in the past .",
    "the optical spectroscopic data provide information about the state of the warm gas in the cluster core that can reinforce inferences drawn from the x - ray and radio data , but do not necessarily provide an indication of the state of feedback in the absence of information about the hot cluster gas and/or radio activity .      in all three bcgs",
    "there is evidence for rotation in the emission - line gas close to the core of the galaxies .",
    "such motion could represent accretion flows in the nuclear regions that provide a channel for feeding material to the central black hole .",
    "furthermore , the axis of rotation within a few kiloparsecs of the nucleus is , in all three cases , approximately aligned with the outflow axes of the radio lobes associated with the galaxies .    in a3581",
    "there is a gradient in the line centroid velocities derived from fits to the narrow emission lines in the galaxy core .",
    "this resembles a velocity field of rotation about an axis oriented at @xmath114 and may be evidence for an accretion disk in the core . from the 1.4ghz radio map ,",
    "the orientation of the radio lobes in the inner part of the jets is approximately @xmath115 on the sky .",
    "if the bright spiral filament in the nebula of a3581 does consist of material that is currently falling into the central galaxy , as suggested in section  [ sec : res : abell ] , it may represent a remaining component of the accretion flows in the galaxy core that contribute to the current nuclear activity .",
    "the orientation of the filament is not well resolved close to the center of the galaxy , but the structure bends towards the north in the inner regions and the data are consistent with a trajectory that is close to perpendicular to the radio axis as it approaches the nucleus .    in 2a0335",
    "+ 096 , @xcite have mapped the velocities of the h@xmath116 emission that forms a dumbbell - shaped structure within the central 2kpc .",
    "there is a velocity shear across this emission region that could represent rotation of gas in an edge - on torus or disk .",
    "the axis of rotation has a position angle on the sky of @xmath117 , which again is close to the orientation of the radio lobes ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "material from this structure could feed the galaxy nucleus and the orientation of the radio outflow axis may have been established by the equatorial accretion flows from this disk of gas in the galaxy core .",
    "if the bar - shaped structure and rotational motion of the outer nebula represent gas settling into a large - scale disk , it is likely to be a manifestation of cooling and accretion activity on large - scales over the cooling region of the cluster core , occurring during a cooling - dominated phase of the feedback cycle .",
    "the opposite sense of the rotation in the outer part of the nebula compared to the motion of gas in the nucleus may indicate that this activity is decoupled from the phase of accretion occurring in the core .",
    "this decoupling represents a break in the accretion of material into the inner part of the nebula that likely results in an interruption of agn fueling and a therefore a lapse in the feedback process .",
    "this may be what allows the cluster core to be largely cooling - dominated at the observed period .    in sersic159 - 03",
    "there is a continuous gradient in line - of - sight velocity across the nucleus that resembles rotation about an axis with @xmath119 .",
    "this axis is close to the axis of the extended radio lobes at @xmath120 .",
    "@xcite also note that there is evidence from their near - infrared , integral - field spectroscopy that the and h@xmath121-emitting gas within several kiloparsecs of the nucleus rotates about an axis parallel to the radio jet .",
    "these relationships between the radio axes and the accretion flows in the cores suggest that the inflows and outflows are closely connected , as expected in the agn feedback model .",
    "the timescales of the implied accretion processes provide a measure of the feasibility of these links .",
    "we can make estimates about the rate of gas accretion into the galaxy cores if we assume that the observed motions represent material in accretion flows that feed cooling material from the nebula into the nucleus , and that the bright filaments in sersic159 - 03 and a3581 trace infalling gas feeding these flows .",
    "the approximate accretion time through the filaments may be estimated from the average velocity @xmath122 of material along the filament and the distance @xmath123 along the structure into the core : @xmath124 .",
    "the mass inflow rate in the filament is then @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the total mass of material in the filament .    this total filament mass is uncertain , since the detailed structure and composition of the nebulae are not known .",
    "our optical line flux measurements indicate that the total mass of ionised gas in the filaments of each in these bcgs is less than @xmath127@xmath15 ( see table  [ tab : totalflux ] ) .",
    "however , this probably represents only a fraction of the total mass , since most of the material is likely to exist in cool , dense phases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from @xcite ,",
    "the approximate mass of warm h@xmath116 in the filaments of sersic159 - 03 is on the order of @xmath128 @xmath15 .",
    "co detections imply a mass of @xmath97@xmath15 of cold molecular gas associated with bcgs of similar luminosity ( including 2a0335 + 096 ; * ? ? ?",
    "assuming that the majority of the material is located in the cool , dense molecular cloud cores in the filaments , the mass in the inner nebula may be @xmath129@xmath15 .",
    "a significant fraction of this could be located in the bright spiral filaments that dominate the nebulae in a3581 and sersic159 - 03 .",
    "we adopt a mass of @xmath130@xmath15 in these filaments , and an average infall velocity of @xmath131  kms@xmath2 .",
    "the distances along the filaments are @xmath132kpc for a3581 and @xmath133kpc for sersic159 - 03 , since the degree of projection is uncertain .",
    "then the minimum mass - inflow rates in the filaments are on the order of several @xmath134@xmath15yr@xmath2 , with infall timescales of @xmath135 to @xmath136yr .    to consider how these inflows might relate to accretion in the nucleus , we compare the infall rates with estimates of the black hole accretion rates required to fuel the observed radio activity .",
    "the 1.4ghz radio power of the radio lobes is @xmath137 whz@xmath2 in a3581 @xcite , and @xmath138 whz@xmath2 for sersic159 - 03 @xcite . using the radio scaling relation derived by @xcite for the radio luminosity at 1.4ghz , @xmath139 : @xmath140 the power required to inflate the lobes @xmath141 in these systems is on the order of @xmath142  ergs@xmath2 , though there is significant scatter in this relation .",
    "the accretion rate @xmath143 required for this output is obtained from @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the efficiency of the conversion of the gravitational binding energy of the accreting material into jet energy .",
    "this is the result of largely unknown physics of agn jet formation , however a value of @xmath146 is commonly adopted ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the required nuclear accretion rate is then approximately @xmath147@xmath15yr@xmath2 for both of these galaxies .",
    "@xcite also estimate accretion rates from energy needed to create the physical volumes of the observed x - ray cavities in these clusters .",
    "they obtain black hole accretion rates of @xmath148 and @xmath39@xmath15yr@xmath2 for a3581 and sersic159 - 03 , respectively .    that the filament mass infall rates exceed the average black hole accretion rates ,",
    "particularly given the uncertainty in the parameters , emphasises that these structures could provide sufficient gas flows to power the agn in these galaxies .",
    "however , this is dependent on the efficiency of mass transfer through the inner accretion flows or disks and onto the black hole .",
    "the results suggest that the filament in a3581 , at least , could fuel the central agn at the current activity level for @xmath149yr .",
    "given the similarity of the rates derived for sersic159 - 03 , however , mass flow through the filaments could , at some times , limit the fuel for nuclear activity if they are the principal source of material feeding accretion , in this system .",
    "the timescales for infall are similar to the estimated frequency of agn outbursts , @xmath150 to @xmath151 years , which also emphasises that the filaments may be conduits for material inflow during cooling episodes that trigger episodes of activity .",
    "in addition , it implies that we might expect to simultaneously observe symptoms of inflow and accretion with those of outflow and heating in some systems , as we do in these galaxies .    in summary",
    ", there is evidence in each bcg for an equatorial component of gas rotation in the galaxy nuclei , where the bipolar radio lobes , or outflows , are oriented approximately along the corresponding polar direction .",
    "this is consistent with gas accretion in the cores of all three galaxies that may be fuelling nuclear activity and the agn outflows .",
    "it corroborates the model of agn - powered heating and feedback in the cluster cores , though observations with higher spatial resolution will be required to better constrain the geometry and properties of the flows .",
    "we have presented optical integral - field spectroscopic observations of the line - emission regions surrounding the bcgs in a3581 , 2a0335 + 096 , and sersic159 - 03 .",
    "galaxies such as these are theorized to be participating in a cycle of negative feedback ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this takes the form of energy and mass exchange between the central black hole , host galaxy , and intra - cluster medium , in which the heating that results from the nuclear activity in the galaxy can offset the energy lost to cooling of the thermal gas in the cluster core .",
    "the cycle is self - regulating because the agn output is governed by the amount of mass that cools and is eventually accreted by the black hole .",
    "we have investigated the kinematics and distribution of optical line emission in the extended filamentary nebulae , and compared these properties with the extent and development of the radio emission in the bcg , and with the properties of the icm .",
    "these data provide evidence of the stage of feedback activity that is occurring in these systems , in the framework of the cold feedback scenario .",
    "the data suggest that a3581 may be in an advanced heating phase of the feedback cycle .",
    "the radio lobes are well - formed and appear to have some impact on the surrounding gas , and also to have themselves been influenced by interactions with the surrounding medium .",
    "there is evidence that the expanding radio lobes are evacuating material from the vicinity of the galaxy .",
    "cooling and inflow still appear to be occurring in the nebula , though , with gas possibly on infalling orbital trajectories along the prominent spiral filament in the central nebula .",
    "the kinematics of the gas in the galaxy core are consistent with rotation in accretion structures in the nucleus .",
    "2a0335 + 096 is likely to be at the opposite end of the feedback cycle , in a phase of strong cooling and accretion , following an episode of agn activity . a large mass of gas is cooling within a wide region surrounding the galaxy . in this system",
    "most of the cooling material appears to be forming a large - scale disk of gas and dust around the central galaxy .",
    "there is evidence for rotation and accretion flows on kiloparsec scales in the galaxy core .",
    "the observations of the optical line emission in sersic159 - 03 show complex structures and kinematics , but do not provide a conclusive picture of the influences on the filaments . as observed in radio and x - ray data , the cluster core has been strongly affected by energy feedback from the central agn in the galaxy , and likely is experiencing significant heating and only moderate cooling and accretion .",
    "there is evidence for gas rotation on scales of several kiloparsecs that may represent accretion flows into the nucleus .",
    "the data for these galaxies appear to be at least qualitatively consistent with a model of cyclic feedback in the cluster cores , so that , as discussed , we can begin to place these systems within the sequence of the feedback cycles that are thought to occur in the cores of galaxy clusters .",
