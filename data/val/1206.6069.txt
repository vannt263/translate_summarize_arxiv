    "recent progress in experimental techniques that allow for dealing with systems involving single atoms or molecules has opened a path for a new generation of electronic and spintronic devices .",
    "@xcite functionality of such systems is usually based on their magnetic properties .",
    "@xcite in particular , the combination of a large spin and uniaxial magnetic anisotropy makes magnetic adatoms  @xcite and single - molecule magnets ( smms )  @xcite promising candidates as information - storage media .",
    "@xcite    the understanding of transport properties of atomic and/or molecular systems exhibiting magnetic anisotropy in the whole range of the coupling to electrodes lies at the bottom of their potential applications .",
    "especially interesting in this context seems to be the limit of _ strong _ coupling , in which some nontrivial many - body effects stemming from the interplay of magnetic anisotropy and the kondo effect are expected .",
    "@xcite in particular , it turned out that the cooperation of quantum tunneling and spin - exchange processes may lead to the pseudo - spin-1/2 kondo effect .",
    "@xcite moreover , as long as a moderate external magnetic field is involved , there are no qualitative differences between the mechanisms of the kondo effect in systems with half- and full - integer spins .",
    "@xcite it has also been suggested that the formation of the kondo resonance should depend on how the system s total spin is modified , i.e. reduced or augmented , upon accepting a surplus electron .",
    "@xcite actually , the kondo effect can occur only in the former case , which corresponds to the antiferromagnetic coupling in the effective spin-1/2 anisotropic kondo hamiltonian .",
    "interestingly enough , by changing the magnitude of transverse magnetic field one can induce the oscillations of the kondo effect , which stem from the berry - phase periodical modulation of the tunnel splitting .",
    "@xcite finally , when the attached electrodes are ferromagnetic , behavior of the tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr ) in the kondo regime for systems under discussion is expected to be significantly different  @xcite from that for typical magnetically isotropic quantum dots .",
    "@xcite    although the observation of the kondo - related features in systems displaying magnetic anisotropy is experimentally challenging as it requires cooling the system down to very low temperatures , several successful measurements have been recently reported .",
    "@xcite generally , variation of temperature in a nanoscopic system revealing the kondo correlations results in a dramatic change of its transport properties . in quantum dots , lowering the temperature @xmath1 below a characteristic energy scale  the _ kondo temperature _ @xmath5  is accompanied by an increase of the conductance to its maximum value , which , on the other hand , becomes gradually suppressed with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite in the kondo regime , the dependence of the linear conductance on temperature is then a universal function of @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite moreover , it was shown very recently that the conductance of quantum dots coupled to ferromagnetic leads or subject to an external magnetic field also exhibits universal features with respect to the ( effective ) magnetic field .",
    "@xcite    the temperature dependence of the kondo effect becomes more complex when the system consists of more impurity spins , and the competition between the spin - exchange processes due to tunneling of electrons and the interaction between the constituent spins is possible . even in the conceptually simplest case involving two exchange coupled spin-1/2 impurities , e.g. as in quantum dots containing an even number of electrons ,  @xcite there are several different scenarios regarding the inter - impurity exchange interaction @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite in the low temperature limit , the impurities form a singlet ( @xmath7 ) for large _",
    "antiferromagnetic _ @xmath2 and",
    "the effect of conduction electrons on the system is weak , while the high - spin triplet ( @xmath8 ) ground state develops for the _ ferromagnetic _ coupling , which then can be screened .",
    "a similar scenario is also relevant for side - coupled double quantum dots in single spin regime , with only one dot coupled directly to conduction electrons .",
    "in such a setup , depending on the strength and sign of the spin exchange interaction between the two dots , a two - stage kondo effect and kosterlitz - thouless quantum phase transition can occur .",
    "@xcite    as the magnitude of the impurity spin becomes larger than 1/2 , a new energy scale related to magnetic anisotropy enters the problem . in the case of a single _ anisotropic _",
    "kondo impurity with spin @xmath9 coupled to a single conduction - electron channel , which accurately represents the situation of a magnetic adatom deposited on a nonmagnetic surface ,  @xcite it has been shown that at low temperatures the spin is ultimately always subject to complete compensation .",
    "@xcite in this paper we consider more complex systems exhibiting an uniaxial magnetic anisotropy , e.g. adatoms , quantum dots side - coupled to a large spin @xmath10 , as well as molecular magnets , where additionally the charge state of the system can be changed owing to electron tunneling processes .",
    "the central aim is then to study the finite - temperature transport properties of such systems , focusing on the kondo regime . understanding the behavior of system at different temperatures is of great importance , as many experiments are actually carried out in the cross - over regime , @xmath11 , when neither fermi liquid ( @xmath12 ) nor perturbative ( @xmath13 ) descriptions are applicable .",
    "our analysis is based on the full density - matrix numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) method ,  @xcite which allows for calculating transport at any temperature in an essentially exact way .",
    "the key features of systems under consideration  such as magnetic adatoms , quantum dots coupled to localized magnetic impurities , and smms  can be reproduced by a model consisting of a single conducting orbital level ( ol ) exchange - coupled with strength @xmath2 to a magnetic core ( spin @xmath10 ) subject to uniaxial magnetic anisotropy @xmath0 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] . this system will be referred to as _ magnetic quantum dot _ ( mqd ) and its hamiltonian has the form  @xcite @xmath14 the orbital level is described by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the occupation operator , with @xmath17 creating ( annihilating ) a spin-@xmath18 electron of energy @xmath19 in the orbital level , while @xmath20 accounts for the coulomb energy of two electrons of opposite spins residing in the orbital .",
    "furthermore , the second term of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq:1 ] ) characterizes the magnetic anisotropy of the core , where @xmath0 denotes the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy constant , and @xmath21 is the @xmath22th component of the mqd s internal spin operator @xmath23 .",
    "the present discussion is limited only to the case of systems exhibiting magnetic bistability ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "finally , the exchange interaction between the magnetic core of a mqd and the spin of an electron occupying the orbital level , given by @xmath25 , with @xmath26 standing for the pauli spin operator , is expressed by the last term of @xmath27 . in general",
    ", the @xmath2-coupling can be either of _ ferromagnetic _ ( fm for @xmath28 ) or _",

    "the magnetic quantum dot is assumed to be tunnel - coupled to two identical electrodes only _ via _ the orbital level , see fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] , and electrons in the @xmath32th electrode [ @xmath33(_l_)eft , ( _ r_)ight ] are modelled by , @xmath34 , with @xmath35 being the relevant creation operator , and @xmath36 the band half - width .",
    "the electron tunneling processes between the mqd and electrodes are described by @xmath37,\\ ] ] where @xmath38 represents the strength of coupling of the orbital level to the @xmath32th lead .    conceptually , the model considered is equivalent to a single - level quantum dot which  if occupied by a single electron  is exchanged coupled to a large - spin magnetic impurity subject to magnetic anisotropy .",
    "@xcite moreover , to some extent it can be regarded as an alternative to a two - impurity kondo model where only one impurity couples directly to conduction band , or to a double quantum dot system in a t - shape geometry .",
    "@xcite from this point of view our model will also exhibit a two - stage kondo effect and a quantum phase transition , as shall be discussed in next section .",
    "generally , the physics of the kondo effect is essentially determined by the number of conduction - electron channels to which the system is coupled , as in order to completely screen a spin @xmath10 one needs @xmath39 channels .",
    "@xcite in this context , high - spin molecular devices are unique as they commonly operate in the regime where effectively only one channel plays a role .",
    "@xcite more precisely , even if the device is coupled to multiple leads , each of such junction usually supports only a single conduction channel , and additionally the couplings are typically characterized by a strong asymmetry . as a result , the relevant kondo energy scale is determined by the strongest coupling , since the kondo temperatures associated with weaker couplings are exponentially small ,  @xcite and hence negligible under typical experimental conditions . in the model considered here",
    "the situation is even simpler , since the orbital level of magnetic quantum dot couples only to an even linear combination of the electron operators in the left and right leads , with a new coupling strength @xmath40 , while the odd combination is completely decoupled .",
    "this basically means that we can limit our discussion to the case of a _ single _ conduction - electron channel .    in the following",
    ", we will study the linear - response transport properties of magnetic quantum dots on various parameters of the system .",
    "the main quantity we are interested in is the temperature - dependent _ linear conductance _",
    "@xmath41 , which we calculate from the landauer - wingreen - meir formula ,  @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the fermi - dirac distribution function , while @xmath44 is the spin - dependent _ spectral function _ of the orbital level , and @xmath45 in the present situation .",
    "the problem of determining the mqd s transport features corresponds then essentially to finding the spin - resolved spectral function @xmath44 , which in the present work is obtained by means of the wilson s numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) method .",
    "@xcite in particular , we employ the recent idea of a full density matrix ,  @xcite which allows for reliable calculation of static and dynamic properties of the system at arbitrary temperatures .",
    "@xcite for the present problem , to obtain decent results , the @xmath46 symmetry was exploited , the discretization parameter @xmath47 was used and we kept @xmath48 states during calculations .",
    "in this paper we consider the transport features of a prototypical magnetic quantum dot characterized by the spin @xmath49 .",

    "[ fig:2 ] . in order to discuss the influence of finite temperature on the kondo effect",

    "the kondo temperature is defined here as the half - width at the half - maximum of the normalized linear conductance @xmath50 as a function of @xmath1 , where @xmath51 is the conductance for @xmath52 , which yields @xmath53 .",

    "parts ( c)-(d ) present the relevant cross - sections of the density plots at the electron - hole symmetry point ( @xmath57 ) for different values of the @xmath2-coupling , as indicated .",
    "the parameters of the system are as follows : @xmath58 mev , @xmath59 and @xmath53 . ]    before the influence of the magnetic anisotropy on the temperature dependence of the kondo effect is analyzed , it is instructive to consider the situation with vanishing magnetic anisotropy , @xmath54 .",
    "the corresponding results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , which presents the dependence of the linear conductance on orbital level position and temperature for different exchange couplings @xmath2 .",
    "it can be seen that when the orbital level is occupied by even number of electrons , which corresponds to an empty or fully occupied level , the conductance is generally suppressed and determined only by elastic cotunneling processes , see figs .",
    "[ fig:2](a , b ) .",
    "on the other hand , for an odd occupation of the orbital level ( single spin regime ) , the kondo effect should in general develop at low temperatures .",
    "now , however , the exchange interaction with the core spin @xmath10 comes into play . in principle",
    ", two distinctive cases with respect to the @xmath2-coupling sign can be recognized .",
    "for the _ ferromagnetic _ exchange coupling , the low temperature behavior of the system is governed by the competition between the coupling @xmath2 and hybridization with electrodes @xmath60 .",
    "the former interaction tends to stabilize the high - spin state , whereas the later one leads to the screening of the orbital level s spin .",
    "it has been shown for a system including two spin-1/2 impurities , that the kondo effect dominates even if the exchange coupling is significantly larger than the hybridization .",
    "@xcite this can be also seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](c ) , where irrespective of the magnitude of @xmath2 , @xmath41 tends to its maximum value in the zero temperature limit .",
    "nevertheless , the exchange interaction still plays a prominent role , because it is responsible for the reduction of the kondo temperature , as compared to a simple spin-1/2 magnetic impurity system .",
    "the situation is qualitatively different for _ antiferromagnetic _ @xmath2-coupling .",

    "more precisely , in the absence of magnetic anisotropy @xmath0 , the ground state of the mqd is the spin multiplet @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) for ferromagnetic ( antiferromagnetic ) exchange interaction @xmath2 . in the case of finite magnetic anisotropy ( @xmath24 ) ,",
    "the ground state becomes two - fold degenerate and consists of the lowest - weight and highest - weight components of the above multiplets , respectively .",
    "@xcite    figure  [ fig:3 ] presents the dependence of the system s linear conductance @xmath41 on the exchange coupling @xmath2 and temperature @xmath1 , for the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic types of the @xmath2-coupling .",

    "the conductance also does not depend on the sign of the parameter @xmath2 , compare the solid lines ( for @xmath75 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](c)-(d ) .",
    "in such a limit , electrons tunneling through the orbital level are hardly affected by the presence of the mqd s magnetic core . however , as @xmath76 , the screening of the orbital level s spin by conduction electrons is suppressed due to the strong exchange interaction of the orbital level s spin with the magnetic core .",
    "one can then observe that while for @xmath77 the conductance @xmath41 just decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath70 , some additional features of @xmath41 emerge for @xmath78 , see figs .",
    "[ fig:3](c)-(d ) .",
    "this stems from the fact that for large @xmath70 the influence of the magnetic core on the orbital level can not be neglected , as the tunneling processes actually take place _ via _ the molecular spin states formed due to the @xmath2-coupling .",
    "since transport properties of the magnetic quantum dot in the linear response regime depend basically on the system s ground state , thus for @xmath76 , it is the sign of the exchange parameter @xmath2 that determines the system s spin multiplets that plays the dominant role , i.e. @xmath79 for ferromagnetic @xmath2 and @xmath80 for antiferromagnetic @xmath2 .",
    "specifically , at low temperatures the mqd with ferromagnetic @xmath2 is found to occupy the doublet state @xmath81 of the spin multiplet @xmath82 , whereas under the same conditions the system with antiferromagnetic @xmath2 prefers the state @xmath83 belonging to the spin multiplet @xmath84 . noting this , the characteristic behavior of the linear conductance for temperatures around @xmath5 in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] can be explained straightforwardly . in general , the conductance displays additional features ( peaks ) whenever the number of mqd s states participating in electronic transport changes due to increased temperature .",
    "for this reason , as soon as @xmath4 , the neighboring states of the same spin multiplet become accessible for electron tunneling processes , and when @xmath1 reaches the value of @xmath70 , @xmath85 , also the states of the other spin multiplet enter into consideration . at these temperatures",
    "the linear conductance displays additional peaks , see figs .  [ fig:3 ] ( c)-(d ) .",
    "nevertheless , it should be emphasized that energies of the mqd s states with the orbital level occupied by a single electron generally depend both on @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite    additional feature visible in fig .",

    "note , however , that the value of @xmath71 , to which the conductance in figs .  [ fig:3 ] ( c)-(d ) is normalized , is different in both cases , and the difference is visible only if @xmath86 , otherwise the thermal fluctuations smear the difference between the cases of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange coupling , figs .",

    ",  @xcite this constant can be as large as @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , we study the effects resulting from magnetic anisotropy and finite temperature for a broad range of anisotropy constant .",
    "figure  [ fig:4 ] shows the linear conductance _ vs. _ temperature and anisotropy constant for both positive and negative exchange coupling @xmath2 .",
    "it can be seen that significant differences between the case of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic @xmath2-coupling occur for @xmath92 . when the anisotropy is weak , the behavior of linear conductance is the same as discussed previously in the case of @xmath54 , i.e. at low temperatures the system is in the underscreened kondo regime for ferromagnetic @xmath2-coupling , while for the antiferromagnetic @xmath2-coupling one observes a two - stage kondo effect .",
    "when the anisotropy increases , see e.g. the case of @xmath93 , both the underscreened and two - stage kondo effects become generally suppressed .",
    "moreover , the temperature dependence of the normalized linear conductance displays a qualitatively different behavior for the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic type of the @xmath2-coupling .",
    "while in the case of ferromagnetic @xmath2 the increase of @xmath1 generates a drop of the conductance , see figs .",
    "[ fig:4](a , c ) , the opposite trend appears for antiferromagnetic @xmath2 , see figs .",
    "[ fig:4](b , d ) .",

    "for this temperature , the molecular states of another multiplet corresponding to the singly occupied orbital level become available for transport .",
