    "the question remains of course ( which we will address in this paper ) what portion of this large fluctuation resides in super - hubble modes , in particular those relevant to structure formation .",
    "recent progress in the theory of reheating came after recognition that in many inflationary models the early stages of reheating can be studied rather completely .",
    "these are models where reheating starts by a parametric resonance @xcite .",
    "parametrically amplified fluctuations are almost classical , and nonlinear effects can be explored numerically in the classical approximation @xcite .",
    "it was found that in many cases the resonant stage is followed by a stage ( called semiclassical thermalization ) , during which nonlinear interactions of fluctuations become increasingly important , and power spectra of the fields eventually become smooth @xcite .",

    "in the subsequent sections we analyze these effects in turn . we find that unless the decay products themselves have infrared - singular spectra the `` erosion '' is not infrared singular and thus can not be important on scales relevant to structure formation . on the other hand ,",

    "for such a species , a spherically - symmetric field will be relatively stable with respect to fragmentation into higher partial waves .",
    "this means that the restriction to spherical symmetry , when it is desired or unavoidable , can be imposed directly on the fields ( and the metric ) , rather than on compound quantities , such as the stress tensor . in this sense",
    ", our calculations will be quite different from those with spherically - symmetric _ fluids _ : in the latter case particles move in all directions ; it is only the large - scale motion of the fluid that is radial . in our case , because of the large mean - free paths , the fluid approximation is not readily available .",

    "@xcite , in preparation of the initial state , we in effect assumed that the volume averages of @xmath116 and of the variances of the metric functions , e.g. the left - hand side of ( [ chivar ] ) , equaled the full 3d variances . as we now see , that was an overestimate of the size of initial fluctuations . however , as typical in problems where amplification of fluctuations is cut off by nonlinear effects , the initial size is relatively unimportant : repeating the run of ref .",
    "@xcite with initial data of the correct size , we find that the strong gravitational effects , which we interpreted as formation of a black hole , are merely postponed from @xmath117 to @xmath118 ( in the units of ref .",
    "we are now in position to estimate metric perturbations caused by the anisotropic stress .",
    "consider eq .",
    "( [ quasin ] ) of the quasilinear approximation . as we have seen in the previous section ,",
    "the initial profile of @xmath0 is a superposition of spherical waves and has a @xmath119 envelope .",
    "this form is preserved during the quasilinear stage for as long as eq .",
    "( [ quasichi ] ) applies .",
    "however , the correlation length of @xmath0 is now determined not by the ultraviolet cutoff , but rather by the typical resonant momentum , @xmath120 : = / k _ * .",

    "( [ quasin ] ) .",
    "( [ aver ] ) is easily integrated .",
    "using the boundary conditions @xmath124 , @xmath125 , we obtain , the condition of vanishing volume average of @xmath126 , as in sect . [ sect : quasi ] , will only change ( [ phi - psi ] ) by an unimportant constant . ] - = 12 c ^2 ^2 _ full \\ { + 12 } .",
    "[ phi - psi ] thus , the average gravitational potentials are more long - ranged than the average of @xmath26 itself , eq .",
    "( [ est1 ] ) .    combining eq .",
    "( [ phi - psi ] ) with the momentum constraint ( [ quasimc ] ) , we can obtain estimates for @xmath127 and @xmath128 separately , at least for @xmath129 .",
    "we will need to integrate eq .",
    "( [ quasimc ] ) so as to remove the spatial derivative .",
    "the second term on the right hand side can only lead to a short - range , i.e. @xmath111 , contribution , while the first term leads to a contribution that is either short - range or suppressed by several powers of @xmath50 .",
    "so , for our present purposes we can take + 0 . [ mc1 ] if , as a result of parametric resonance , the field @xmath0 grows with a characteristic exponent @xmath130 , the potentials @xmath24 and @xmath25 , as ( [ phi - psi ] ) and ( [ mc1 ] ) show , grow with characteristic exponent @xmath131 .",
    "then , from ( [ mc1 ] ) we see that ~ , [ psillphi ] where @xmath132 is the frequency ( in conformal time ) of the inflaton s oscillations . therefore , ~ , [ phi ] and then ( [ psillphi ] ) is an estimate for @xmath128 .",
    "we see that , up to a weak logarithmic factor , the average potentials are independent of @xmath109 .",
    "we stress , however , that these estimates apply only in quasilinear theory .",
    "the approximate volume independence of @xmath127 and @xmath128 during the resonant growth of @xmath0 is confirmed by numerical integrations .",
    "integrations were done using the algorithm described in ref .",
    "@xcite and are fully nonlinear . for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : psi ] shows @xmath133 for @xmath134 and @xmath135 . here",
    "@xmath136 is the conformal factor at the outer end of the grid , and @xmath137 is defined by ( _",
    "h)^2 = 4_k_^ dk k^2 p_(k ) , [ svar ] where @xmath138 is the power spectrum of @xmath139 , and @xmath98 is the minimal lattice momentum .",
    "fourier components of @xmath139 , required for calculation of the power spectrum , are determined via a sine transform . during the resonant growth of @xmath0 , the metric functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 rapidly become smooth and can therefore be regarded as self - averaging . for this reason , the quantity plotted in fig . [ fig : psi ] should give a good idea of the typical values of @xmath128 .",
    "numerical values of @xmath127 and @xmath128 predicted by the estimates ( [ phi ] ) and ( [ psillphi ] ) are quite small .",
    "the usual estimate @xcite for the maximum value of @xmath87 is ^2 _ full ~ ~ , [ maxchi2 ] so for @xmath140 and @xmath141 we obtain ~10 ^ -7 ( r/ ) .",
    "[ phiandpsi ] from fig .",
    "[ fig : psi ] , we see that the lattice result by far exceeds the estimate ( [ phiandpsi ] ) , even during the stage of exponential growth , which one might want to identify with the quasilinear stage .",
    "the reason is that , because of the @xmath111 form of @xmath116 , the quasilinear approximation , strictly speaking , breaks down quite early on  when @xmath116 becomes of order ( [ maxchi2 ] ) at @xmath142 .",
    "the growth of various quantities can still continue , however , because in most of the space @xmath116 is still much smaller than that .",
    "( we discuss this point further in the next section . )    during the entire exponential growth , the two curves corresponding to different box sizes coincide with excellent precision , in agreement with the approximate volume independence of @xmath128 derived analytically .",
    "the time when the curves part corresponds to breakdown of the quasilinear theory in most of the space . at that time , volume dependence of the results is not surprising : nonlinear gravitational phenomena , such as gravitational collapse , depend on the total amount of matter available and will be more pronounced in a larger volume .",
    "the driving force due to local scattering in eq .",
    "( [ quasiphi ] ) can be estimated as g^2 ^2 ~g^2 ^2 ^2 _ full / r^2 .",
    "[ local ] fluctuation of @xmath1 caused by this driving force at @xmath142 is ~ .",
    "this becomes of order @xmath1 when @xmath116 reaches the value ( [ maxchi2 ] ) .",
    "after that @xmath116 does not grow any further at @xmath142 but continues to grow at @xmath143 .    from our lattice data , it appears that this later growth is a combination of the usual resonant growth and rescattering of fluctuations from smaller @xmath10 , where they are already large .. as a result , the region where @xmath116 is large propagates to larger @xmath10 , so that the quasilinear form ( [ est1 ] ) no longer applies . from eq .",
    "( [ quasin ] ) , we see that the growth of this region leads to a further growth of metric perturbations . if the total volume is large enough , these can eventually become sufficiently large to cause a gravitational instability .",
    "the time when the resonant growth of @xmath0 has ended in most of the space corresponds to a short plateau around @xmath144 in fig .",
    "[ fig : psi ] .",
    "the subsequent growth of @xmath137 has a different origin : we interpret it is a result of an additional production of @xmath30 by another , weaker resonance , due to the @xmath145 interaction . during this further growth ,",
    "we observe formation of a black hole  the lapse @xmath20 , as a function of @xmath10 , crosses zero . ) , a sphere on which @xmath146 can not be crossed by a classical particle , and is therefore a horizon .",
    "on the other hand , quantum particles , or classical waves , can transport energy across the horizon ( similarly to hawking radiation ) ; we suppose this transport is the cause of growth or evaporation of black holes in our simulations . ]",
    "the presence of the second stage of growth in fig .",
    "[ fig : psi ] leads to an important conclusion .",
    "if some decay channel becomes blocked while the inflaton s homogeneous component still has not decayed completely , the inflaton will `` wait '' until a new channel opens up .",
    "at least in our spherically - symmetric geometry , and in the model considered here , its decay via the new channel still causes significant metric perturbations .",
    "this conclusion holds also in the case when the decay of the inflaton into @xmath0 is blocked by a @xmath147 self - interaction ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : we show the result for @xmath148 ( a stronger resonance ) and @xmath149 by short dashes in fig .",
    "[ fig : psi ] . in this case",
    ", the decay into @xmath0 is cut off at much smaller values of metric perturbations , and the interpretation of the second stage of growth as the @xmath150 resonance is unambiguous .",
    "in this paper we have studied the influence of nonlinear effects , arising during decay of the inflaton , on metric perturbations .",
    "although we restricted our attention to a quartic potential for the inflaton , results for other models of chaotic inflation can be obtained by similar methods , and we believe they will be similar in nature .",
    "early stages of the inflaton decay can be studied analytically , using the quasilinear approximation , at least under the restriction to spherical symmetry ( a similar approximation may exist also in the full 3d case ) .",
    "the quasilinear approximation retains quadratic terms in the decay products ; these are the leading terms affecting metric perturbations after inflation in the case when fields interacting with the inflaton do not have sizeable homogeneous components .    using the quasilinear approximation , we have identified two effects that could potentially produce large - scale metric perturbations after the end of inflation .",
    "we have found that the first of these effects  scattering of the second field @xmath0 off the inflaton s homogeneous component  does not cause significant super - hubble perturbations in the quasilinear regime .",
    "however , the second type of effect  metric perturbations caused by the anisotropic stress  has been found to be important .",
    "it is interesting to contemplate how this latter effect is able to avoid the restriction on super - hubble physics imposed by causality . to this end , note that a spherical wave has a large degree of _ angular _ coherence : even for a wave with momentum much larger than the hubble parameter , angular coherence extends over scales that are not in causal contact .",
    "parametric amplification of such fluctuations is not restricted by causality ( just as it is not restricted during inflation ) .",
    "persistence of angular coherence of fluctuations in the full three dimensions corresponds to a large mean - free path . as we have discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect : sphe ] , this is indeed likely to be the case at the early stages of reheating in weakly - coupled models .",
    "however , because restriction to spherical symmetry explicitly breaks translational invariance , it is not immediately obvious how our results can be transplanted to the full 3d case .",
    "indeed , the @xmath10 dependence of the ensemble averages @xmath127 and @xmath128 ( cf .",
    "( [ phi - psi ] ) ) is a direct consequence of the translational non - invariance and is not expected to persist in three dimensions .",
    "instead , the 3d picture that we have in mind is a sort of `` metric turbulence '' , in which a ( nearly ) spherically - symmetric fluctuation in a sphere of radius @xmath151 sits on top of a fluctuation in a sphere of a larger radius @xmath152 .",
    "then , instead of @xmath127 and @xmath128 we should consider the total perturbation from all scales shorter than some @xmath109 , e.g. _",
    "r = ^2 ^1/2 , [ deltar ] so for example the quasilinear result ( [ phi ] ) will correspond to _",
    "r ~ [ deltaphi ] ( with an approximately scale - invariant 3d spectrum @xmath153 ) .",
    "perturbation ( [ deltaphi ] ) is by itself quite small .",
    "we have seen , however , that in spherical symmetry a much larger perturbation is possible , due to spreading out of the region where fluctuations of @xmath0 are large . in sect .",
    "[ sect : nonl ] , we have argued that this is indeed the mechanism of gravitational instability and formation of black holes observed in our lattice studies . because this mechanism involves already large field fluctuations , we can not exclude the possibility that in the full three dimensions scattering of these large fluctuations destroys angular coherence , by breaking the @xmath105-wave into higher partial waves , and the formation of black holes is prevented .",
    "however , if black holes do form in the full 3d by the mechanism identified here , the question remains what is the spectrum of metric perturbations after these black holes evaporate .",
