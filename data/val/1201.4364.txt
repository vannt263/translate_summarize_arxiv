    "neutrinos play an important role in the evolution of the universe and in many astrophysical processes .",
    "their properties are under intense study and some rigorous restrictions have been obtained on their anomalous properties from controlled experiments and astrophysical observations . the large hadron collider ( lhc )",
    "offer the opportunity of a very rich physics program .",
    "it is remarkable to examine the potential of lhc for probing anomalous neutrino properties .    in the minimal extension of the standard model ( sm ) with massive neutrinos ,",
    "radiative corrections induce tiny couplings of @xmath9 and @xmath4 @xcite . despite the fact that minimal extension of the sm induces very small couplings , there are several models beyond the sm predicting relatively large @xmath10 and @xmath4 couplings .",
    "therefore it is meaningful to search for electromagnetic properties of the neutrinos in a model independent way .",
    "electromagnetic properties of the neutrinos have important implications on particle physics , astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "probing electromagnetic structure of the neutrinos is important for understanding the physics beyond the sm and contributes to the studies in astrophysics and cosmology .    atlas and cms collaborations have a program of forward physics with extra detectors located at distances of 220 m and 420 m from the interaction point @xcite .",
    "physics program of this new instrumentation covers soft and hard diffraction , high energy photon - induced interactions , low - x dynamics with forward jet studies , large rapidity gaps between forward jets , and luminosity monitoring @xcite .",
    "these forward detector equipment allows to detect intact scattered protons with some momentum fraction loss @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 is the momentum of incoming proton and @xmath13 is the momentum of intact scattered proton .",
    "complementary to proton - proton interactions , forward detector equipment at the lhc allows to study photon - photon and photon - proton interactions at energies higher than at any existing collider .",
    "photon induced reactions in a hadron - hadron collision were observed in the measurements of cdf collaboration @xcite .",
    "the reactions such as @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath15 @xcite , @xmath16 @xcite were verified experimentally .",
    "these results raise interest on the potential of lhc as a photon - photon and photon - proton collider .    in this paper",
    "we have investigated anomalous @xmath0 and @xmath4 couplings via @xmath2 production in a @xmath3 collision at the lhc .",
    "a quasi - real photon emitted from one proton beam can interact with the other proton and produce @xmath2 pair through deep inelastic scattering .",
    "emitted quasi - real photons are described by equivalent photon approximation ( epa ) @xcite .",
    "their virtuality is very low and it is a good approximation to assume that they are on - mass - shell . in fig.[fig1 ] we show a schematic diagram for our main reaction @xmath17 .",
    "intact scattered protons after the collision can be detected by the forward detectors . in correlation with central detectors",
    "a distinctive signal for the @xmath3 collision can be identified .",
    "in particular , two experimental signatures arise for any reaction in a @xmath3 collision @xcite : in the framework of epa , emitted quasi - real photons from the protons have a low virtuality and scattered with small angles from the beam pipe .",
    "therefore when a proton emits a quasi - real photon it should also be scattered with a small angle .",
    "hence , intact scattered protons exit the central detector without being detected .",
    "this causes a decrease in the energy deposit in the corresponding forward region compare to the case which the proton remnants are detected by the calorimeters .",
    "consequently , for a @xmath3 collision , one of the forward regions of the central detector has a significant lack of energy .",
    "the region which is lack of particles defines a forward large rapidity gap .",
    "usual @xmath18 deep inelastic processes can be rejected by applying a selection cut on this quantity .",
    "another experimental signature is provided by the forward detectors . when an intact proton is scattered with a large pseudorapidity it escape detection from the central detectors .",
    "but since its energy is lower than the beam energy , its trajectory decouples from the beam path into the very forward region .",
    "forward detectors can detect particles with a large pseudorapidity .",
    "the detection of intact protons by the forward detectors provides a characteristic signature .",
    "the detection of the @xmath17 reaction involves in addition to the above signatures , a missing energy signature due to @xmath2 production .",
    "missing energy signature due to neutrinos has a different characteristic compare to the case of missing protons .",
    "first , a missing energy signature due to neutrinos is not only observed in the forward regions of the central detector but also central regions of it .",
    "second , in the case of missing protons there should be a missing charge equivalent to the charge of proton .",
    "third and the most important difference is that protons scattered with small angles are not genuinely missing .",
    "forward detectors can detect them . on the other hand , this is not the case for neutrinos .",
    "forward detectors have a capability to detect intact scattered protons with momentum fraction loss in the interval @xmath19 .",
    "the interval @xmath20 is called the acceptance of the forward detectors .",
    "the acceptance of @xmath21 is proposed by the atlas forward physics ( afp ) collaboration @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "cms - totem forward detector scenario propose an acceptance of @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "since the forward detectors can detect protons in a continuous range of @xmath23 one can impose some cuts and choose to work in a subinterval of the whole acceptance region . in this paper",
    "we consider three different forward detector acceptances ; @xmath21 , @xmath6 and @xmath24 .",
    "new physics probes in photon - induced reactions at the lhc have been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that @xmath25 collision at the lhc has a great potential to probe @xmath4 couplings .",
    "it provides more than seven orders of magnitude improvement in @xmath4 couplings compared to lep limits @xcite .",
    "we employ the following effective lagrangian for non - standard @xmath26 coupling @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the magnetic moment of @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xmath31 is the transition magnetic moment . in the above effective lagrangian new physics energy scale @xmath32",
    "is absorbed in the definition of @xmath30 .",
    "non - standard @xmath33 coupling can be described by the following dimension 7 effective lagrangian@xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are dimensionless coupling constants .",
    "we will consider dirac neutrino case and obtain model independent bounds on couplings in the effective lagrangians ( [ nunuphoton ] ) and ( [ nunuphotonphoton ] ) .",
    "we have rigorous experimental bounds on neutrino magnetic moment obtained from neutrino - electron scattering experiments with reactor neutrinos .",
    "these are at the order of @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "bounds derived from solar neutrinos are at the same order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "on the other hand we have more restrictive bounds obtained from astrophysical observations .",
    "for instance , bounds derived from energy loss of astrophysical objects give about an order of magnitude more restrictive bounds than reactor and solar neutrino probes @xcite .",
    "although there is a great amount of work on @xmath0 coupling , @xmath4 coupling has been much less studied in the literature .",
    "current experimental bounds on this coupling are obtained from rare decay @xmath40 @xcite and the analysis of @xmath41 conversion @xcite .",
    "the following upper bound has been obtained from the lep data on @xmath42 decay @xcite @xmath43 ^ 6 \\sum_{i , j , k}\\left(|\\alpha^{ij}_{rk}|^2+|\\alpha^{ij}_{lk}|^2\\right)\\leq2.85\\times10^{-9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the analysis of the process @xmath44 conversion via primakoff effect in the external coulomb field of the nucleus @xmath45 yields about two orders of magnitude more restrictive bound than @xmath42 decay @xcite .",
    "we consider the following subprocesses of our main reaction @xmath46 @xmath47 in the presence of the effective interaction ( [ nunuphoton ] ) each of the subprocesses is described by eight tree - level diagrams ( fig.[fig2 ] ) . as we see from fig.[fig2 ] , six diagram contains non - standard @xmath48 interaction .",
    "the analytical expression for the polarization summed amplitude square is quite lengthy so we do not present it here .",
    "but it can be written in the following form : @xmath49 where @xmath50 here , @xmath51 are the `` flavor independent '' amplitudes of the diagrams shown in fig.[fig2 ] . by using a phrase `` flavor independent '' we mean the part of the amplitude which does not contain the coupling constants @xmath30 or equivalently amplitude with @xmath30=1 . since the structure of the effective lagrangian ( [ nunuphoton ] ) is same for each neutrino flavor and we omit the mass of neutrinos , @xmath52 amplitudes are independent of the neutrino flavor . in the definitions of @xmath53 functions ,",
    "average over initial spins and sum over final spins is implied . since it is impossible to discern final neutrino flavor , in eqn.([amplitude1 ] )",
    "we perform a sum over flavor indices @xmath54 and @xmath55 .    in the case of effective interaction ( [ nunuphotonphoton ] ) we have three tree - level diagrams ( fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "the polarization summed amplitude square can be written in the form : @xmath56 where @xmath57 , \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\alpha_2",
    "^ 2=\\sum_{i , j}\\left[|\\alpha^{ij}_{r2}|^2+|\\alpha^{ij}_{l2}|^2\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath58 are some functions of the momenta . again a sum over indices @xmath54 and @xmath55 has been performed .",
    "analytical expressions for @xmath59 and @xmath60 are given in the appendix .",
    "in the framework of epa , equivalent photon spectrum of virtuality @xmath61 and energy @xmath62 is given by the following formula @xcite @xmath63\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 here e is the energy of the incoming proton beam and @xmath65 is the mass of the proton .",
    "the magnetic moment of the proton is @xmath66 . @xmath67 and @xmath68 are functions of the electric and magnetic form factors . in the above epa formula , electromagnetic form factors of the proton have been taken into consideration .",
    "after integration over @xmath61 in the interval @xmath69 , equivalent photon spectrum can be written as @xcite @xmath70\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the function @xmath71 is defined by @xmath72+\\frac{y(1-b)}{4x(1+x)^3}\\nonumber\\\\ + c\\left(1+\\frac{y}{4}\\right)\\left[ln\\left(\\frac{1-b+x}{1+x}\\right)+\\sum_{k=1}^3\\frac{b^k}{k(1+x)^k}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 the contribution to the integral above @xmath74 is negligible . therefore during calculations we set @xmath75 .",
    "the cross section for the complete process @xmath76 can be obtained by integrating the cross section for the subprocess @xmath77 over the photon and quark spectra : @xmath78 here , @xmath79 and @xmath80 is the momentum fraction of the proton s momentum carried by the quark . at high energies greater than proton mass",
    "it is a good approximation to write @xmath81",
    ". therefore upper and lower limits of the @xmath82 integral are @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath85 is the quark distribution function of the proton .",
    "the virtuality of the quark is taken to be @xmath86 during calculations . in our calculations",
    "parton distribution functions of martin , stirling , thorne and watt @xcite have been used .",
    "we always sum all the contributions from subprocesses given in eq.([subprocesses ] ) .    assuming only one of the matrix element @xmath30 is different from zero , say @xmath87 , we plot the integrated total cross section of the process @xmath17 as a function of anomalous coupling @xmath87 in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "we see from fig.[fig4 ] that cross sections for the acceptances @xmath88 and @xmath6 are close to each other . on the other hand , cross section for @xmath24 is considerably smaller than others . in fig.[fig5 ] we plot the integrated total cross section of the process @xmath89 as a function of anomalous coupling @xmath90 for the acceptances @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "cross sections in fig.[fig5 ] reflect similar behavior to fig.[fig4 ] . in all results presented in this paper",
    "we assume that center of mass energy of the proton - proton system is @xmath91 tev .",
    "we have estimated 95% confidence level ( c.l . )",
    "bounds using one - parameter @xmath92 test without a systematic error . the @xmath92 function is given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the cross section containing new physics effects and @xmath95 is the statistical error .",
    "the number of events is given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the integrated luminosity .",
    "atlas and cms have central detectors with a pseudorapidity coverage @xmath98 .",
    "therefore we place a cut of @xmath98 for final quarks from subprocess @xmath99 .",
    "we observe from eq.([amplitude1 ] ) that cross section including @xmath0 coupling depends on the couplings of the form ; @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "it receives contributions from all of the matrix elements @xmath103 .",
    "as we have mentioned in the previous section , some of the matrix elements are strictly constrained by the experiments .",
    "as far as we know the least constrained element is @xmath104 .",
    "the bound on this element is @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "this bound is at least 3 orders of magnitude weaker than the bounds on other matrix elements @xcite .",
    "therefore in the numerical calculations we can neglect these strictly constrained elements and assume that only @xmath104 is nonvanishing . in tables [ tab1 ] , [ tab2 ] and [ tab3 ] we show 95% c.l .",
    "upper bounds of the couplings @xmath104 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 for three different forward detector acceptances .",
    "we see from these tables that our limits on @xmath104 are worse than the current experimental limit .",
    "our most sensitive limit is approximately 5 times weaker than the donut bound @xcite . on the other hand",
    "we see from the tables that our bounds on @xmath106 and @xmath107 are approximately at the order of @xmath108 . it is more than 8 orders of magnitude more restrictive than the lep bound .",
    "forward detector acceptance of @xmath24 provides more restrictive bounds on both @xmath104 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 couplings with respect to the @xmath5 and @xmath109 cases .",
    "this originates from the fact that although the cross sections in @xmath24 case are small , deviations of the anomalous cross sections from the standard model value are considerably large compare to @xmath5 and @xmath109 cases .",
    "forward physics program of atlas and cms collaborations provides an enhancement of the physics studied at the lhc . it allows to study photon - photon and photon - proton interactions at energies higher than at any existing collider .",
    "lhc as a photon - photon or photon - proton collider presents an ideal venue to probe neutrino electromagnetic properties at a high energy .",

    "we show that this reaction has a great potential to probe neutrino - two photon couplings .",
    "it improves the sensitivity limits by up to a factor of @xmath111 with respect to lep limits .",
    "our limits are also better than the limits obtained in reactions @xmath112 and @xmath113 at the lhc @xcite .",
