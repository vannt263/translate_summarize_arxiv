    "about 30.000 stars with b , a and early f type classification were extracted from the michigan catalogue of two dimensional spectral types for the hd stars ( nancy houk et al . , 1975 - 1988 ; hereafter mc ) . in the southern sky region from @xmath3 to @xmath1 , 1500 objects are classified as cp2 stars . the limiting magnitude of this survey is 11 , the maximum of the distribution of magnitudes is between 8.5 and 10 for both subgroups .",
    "74% of all extracted cp2 stars are members of the si - subgroup .",
    "they are more concentrated towards the galactical plane than the cooler stars . in the galactic area from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , there are 84% of all hotter silicon stars and 58% of all srcreu stars . as expected , this result is in accordance with the galactic distribution of main sequence stars . a tendency to clustering for the investigated stars was not found .",
    "bidelman & macconnell ( 1973 ; hereafter bc ) list 781 cp2 objects .",
    "their classification is based on the same objective - prism plates as the sample of the michigan catalogue .",
    "most of the compared stars have the same or a similar spectral classification in mc and bc .",
    "photometric values are given for 981 stars in the geneva system ( rufener 1988 ) as well as in the 3-filter @xmath2 system ( maitzen & vogt 1983 ) .",
    "430 out of 645 bc stars with known geneva photometric indices , have a significant peculiarity .",
    "75% of 339 bc - stars are peculiar in @xmath2 .",
    "three quarters of this sample are members of the si subgroup .",
    "hd 134185 was classified as f0/2 v in mc ( f2 v in the geneva catalogue ) , but as si in bc .",
    "si may be a typographical error meaning sr , but the photometric @xmath2 value confirms non - peculiarity .    the spectral class of hd 91756 is given as fm @xmath6 del in mc , ( a0 ) in the geneva catalogue and ap(srcr ) in bc .",
    "the geneva peculiarity index @xmath7 shows no significant value for this star .",
    "hd 110072 is identified as ap(srcr ) in mc and bc but as k0 in the geneva catalogue and the simbad database .",
    "the photometric values in the geneva catalogue point to a late a - type star .",
    "a total of 78 stars are identified as non - cp2 stars in mc but as si , sr or srcreu in bc .",
    "the spectral classification and photometric values in the geneva catalogue are also different for these objects .",
    "therefore , we started an observing run with @xmath2 photometry for a sample of them .",
    "only 29 of the discrepant stars are peculiar in the geneva photometric system .",
    "21 objects with known geneva indices were measured with a ccd in the @xmath2 system by h.m .",
    "maitzen and e.  paunzen ( maitzen et al . 1997 ) .",
    "observations were performed with the 61-cm bochum telescope at eso - la silla on three nights from 29 to 31 may 1995 .",
    "the three filters g@xmath8 , g@xmath9 and y were used ; their characteristics are listed in the following table .",
    "we regard a star as photometrically peculiar if @xmath12 or @xmath13mag . to check",
    "the peculiarity found this way , the geneva criterion @xmath14mag ( north & cramer 1981 ) may be applied .",
    "we were unable to find here a significant influence of interstellar reddening on the @xmath15-values , which might be expected from the relatively blue wavelength of @xmath16 compared to those of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "obviously the rather low amount of reddening did not succeed in producing sensible differential effects on the a - values .      comparing the classification performances of both sources ( mc and bc ) with the help of the new available photometric evidence ,",
    "one notes that for eleven b - type stars with a giant luminosity class according to mc , the bc - peculiarity assignments are in better agreement with our results then the mc types . only in three cases",
    "are the geneva - based @xmath19 values ( north & kroll 1989 ) typical of giants while the @xmath2 index shows no peculiarity .",
