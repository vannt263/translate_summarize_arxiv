    "we further compare our results with the models of @xcite where masses and radii are given for a range of planetary masses , orbital separations and stellar ages . for wasp-14b , these models predict a planetary radius @xmath50 for a host star of age 1 gyr , while for an age of 300 myr",

    "our observations do not place strong constraints on the core mass of wasp-14b .",
    "one of the interesting features of wasp-14b is its high orbital eccentricity , @xmath56 , for its small orbital distance of 0.036 au . at this distance",
    ", any orbital eccentricity should induce strong tidal energy dissipation within the planet leading to circularisation of the orbit .",
    "@xcite determined a median eccentricity of 0.013 for close - in planets with semi - major axis @xmath57 au .",
    "the nearly - circular orbits of most close - orbiting exoplanets indicate tidal circularisation timescales significantly shorter than the system age .",
    "the high eccentricity of wasp-14b may thus indicate either a system age comparable to the tidal circularisation timescale , or the presence of an additional perturbing body in the system .    in the tidal evolution scenario originally developed by @xcite and more recently discussed by @xcite and others , the circularisation timescale ( @xmath58 ) and spiral - in timescale ( @xmath59 ) for a single planet are given by the logarithmic time derivatives of the orbital eccentricity and semi - major axis : @xmath60 using the equations given in @xcite for close - in extrasolar planets , and the planetary and stellar parameters for the wasp-14 system , we obtain @xmath61 $ ] gyr and @xmath62 $ ] gyr . here the tidal dissipation parameters @xmath63 for the planet and @xmath64 for the star are assigned fiducial values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively in accordance with the best - fitting values derived from the study of @xcite . it should be mentioned here that there could be considerable uncertainties in both these parameters ; moreover , the timescales are inversely proportional to the fifth powers of the planetary and stellar radii , both of which contain significant uncertainties in their determinations .",
    "from the expression for @xmath58 above , the circularisation timescale of the planet s orbit will be less than 1 gyr if either @xmath67 or @xmath68 .",
    "the timescale for decay of the orbital semi - major axis of the planet via torques arising from the tidal bulge raised on the star could also be less than 1 gyr if @xmath69 .",
    "these same torques might be expected to spin the star up on a timescale of the order of 1 gyr , since the angular momentum loss in the wind of a f star like wasp-14 is quite weak .",
    "a dissipation factor @xmath70 could increase the life expectancy of the planet to a value similar to the main - sequence lifetime of the f - type host .",
    "if @xmath63 is low and the circularisation timescale is short , the most plausible alternative mechanism for maintaining the high eccentricity of wasp-14b is secular interaction with an additional planet in the system ( see , e.g. , adams & laughlin  2006 ) . from the arguments above ,",
    "however , it is not clear whether an additional planet is needed to maintain the observed eccentricity over the @xmath16 1 gyr lifetime of the star .",
    "this is only needed if the rate at which tidal energy is dissipated in the planet is high , with @xmath71 .",
    "the slow stellar spin suggests that magnetic braking is dominating over torques arising from the tidal bulge raised on the star .",
    "this in turn suggests a low rate of dissipation in the star , with @xmath72 or so .",

    "2008 ) also have apparently significant orbital eccentricity .",
    "while @xcite noted that sparsely sampled radial velocity curves are often interpreted as having significant orbital eccentricity , in the case of the wasp planets the spectroscopic data is usually obtained over a small number of cycles and with good precision .",
    "consequently , we expect the eccentricities derived for these systems to be free from bias or selection effects .",
    "we have discovered a new massive exoplanet wasp-14b orbiting with a period of about 2.244 days around its host main - sequence star gsc 0148200882 .",

    "high precision photometric and spectroscopic follow - up observations reveal that the planet has a mass of 7.3@xmath20.5 m@xmath0 , radius of 1.28@xmath20.08 r@xmath0 suggesting a mean density of 3.5@xmath20.6 @xmath73 ( @xmath16 4.6 g@xmath3 ) , and an eccentricity of 0.091@xmath20.003 .",
    "the mean density of wasp-14b is high in comparison with a typical hot jupiter density of 0.34 - 1.34 g@xmath3 @xcite , and similar to that of rocky planets and makes it densest transiting exoplanets so far discovered with @xmath54 3 d orbital period .",

    "this is consistent with its stellar temperature ( @xmath35 = 6475@xmath2100 k ) and age of about 0.51.0 gyr which is further supported by the fitting of stellar evolutionary models of the @xcite .",
    "high orbital eccentricities in close - in planets are often explained by perturbations from a third body ( jackson et al .",
    "2008 and references therein ) or internal structures that result in their tidal dissipation factor being significantly larger that that commonly assumed @xmath74 ( matsumura et al .",
    "2008 , hebb et al .",
    "although we do not see any systematic variation in rv residuals during our two months of spectroscopic observations of wasp-14 , we expect that long term radial velocity monitoring will help constrain the nature of the third body in this systems hence make it an important target both for future transit - timing variation studies and for longer - term rv monitoring to establish the mass and period of the putative outer planet .",
    "wasp-14b is one of the most massive transiting planets known along with hat - p-2b @xcite and xo-3b @xcite and its physical characteristics closely resemble with those of hat - p-2 except the latter has a much longer orbital period and smaller radius . however , there is still no firm explanation about the formation of such highly massive planets ( e.g. , hbrard et .",
    "al  2008 ) .",
    "a quite interesting feature is that all these three massive exoplanets has unusually large eccentric orbit for their short orbital period .",
    "matsumura et al . ( 2008 ) argues that the new class of eccentric , short period transiting planets are still in the process of circularization and speculates that @xmath63 could be as large as 10@xmath75 for these planets .",
    "the success of theoretical models of planetary structure depends heavily on our precise knowledge of the basic physical parameters of the planetary systems .",
    "transit surveys in recent times have produced a large sample of transiting planets that show a remarkable diversity in their mass , radius and internal structure . while most of the jupiter - mass transiting planets are well explained by existing models , planets which show excessive mass for their small radius or relatively low mass for their large radius are yet to be explained satisfactorily by any available model .",
    "wasp-14b is one of the few massive exoplanets , some of which are even in closer orbits than most other hot jupiters .",

    "<S> spectral analysis of the host star reveals a temperature of @xmath5 k , log g = 4.07 cms@xmath6 and @xmath7 kms@xmath8 , and also a high lithium abundance , @xmath9 = 2.84@xmath20.05 . </S>",
