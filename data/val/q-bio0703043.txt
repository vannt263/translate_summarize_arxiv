    "recently , driven diffusive systems have attracted the interests of physicists because the systems show surprisingly rich and complex behavior.@xcite as a simple model of driven diffusive systems , asymmetric simple exclusion processes ( aseps ) have been widely studied in chemistry and physics.@xcite moreover , aseps have been applied successfully in biology such as gel electrophoresis,@xcite protein synthesis,@xcite mrna translation phenomena,@xcite motion of molecular motors along the cytoskeletal filaments,@xcite and the depolymerization of microtubules by special enzymes@xcite as well as vehicular traffic.@xcite    a totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) is regarded as the minimal model of aseps , in which particles move along one direction .",
    "tasep has received much attention in modeling intra - cellular molecular transport and related traffic problems@xcite in recent years .",
    "macdonald et al.@xcite initially used a tasep to simulate the dynamics of ribosomes moving along messenger rna chains .",
    "kruse and sekimoto@xcite proposed a two - headed tasep model to describe molecular motor traffic . in their model , each motor consists of two heads and each head is attached to a filament .",
    "each filament is assumed to be moveable .",
    "the investigation indicates that the average relative velocity of filaments is a non - monotonic function of the concentration of motors . the density and current profiles of motors with different types of microtubule tracks ( e.g. , cylindrical geometry and radial geometry ) have been investigated by lipowsky et al.@xcite    an extension of single - lane tasep , incorporating langmuir kinetics ( lk , the attachment and detachment of particles ) , has been presented by parmeggiani et al.@xcite their model is also referred to as the pff model .",
    "numerical results of the pff model show that there are unexpected stationary regimes for large but finite systems .",
    "such regimes are represented by phase coexistence in both low and high density regions , which are separated by a domain wall .",
    "a model , incorporating a tasep , langmuir kinetics and brownian ratchet mechanism,@xcite is proposed by nishinari et al.@xcite to mimic the movement of the single - headed kinesin motor , kif1a .",
    "a novel feature in their model is that there are _ three _ states ( strong binding , weak binding and no binding ) of a kif1a , compared to _ two _ states ( binding or unbinding ) in previous models .",
    "their model can capture explicitly the effects of adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) hydrolysis as well as the ratchet mechanism which drives individual motors .",
    "the experimentally observed single molecular properties in the low - density limit are reproduced and a phase diagram is presented .    most previous work on modeling molecular motor traffic deals with single - lane systems where particles can move forward or backward , or attach and detach to a bulk ( a collection of sites in a lane except boundaries ) . obviously , the description of the traffic of motors would be more realistic if multi - lane asymmetric exclusion processes can be considered .",
    "experimental observations@xcite have found that motor protein kinesins can move along parallel protofilaments of microtubules and they can jump between these protofilaments without restraint .",
    "recently , pronina and kolomeisky@xcite proposed a two - lane traffic model to simulate a tasep with symmetric lane - changing rules between two lanes , but without langmuir kinetics .",
    "the computational results suggest that lane - changing rates have a strong effect on the steady - state properties of the system .",
    "in particular , the particle current of each lane will decrease and particle densities will increase with the increase of particle coupling .",
    "pronina and kolomeisky then extended their model to a more general case where asymmetric coupling is applied.@xcite it is found that asymmetric coupling between lanes leads to a very complex phase diagram , quite different from symmetric coupling .",
    "there are seven phases in the tasep with asymmetric lane - changing rates , in contrast to three phases found in the system with symmetric coupling .",
    "in addition , a new maximal - current phase with a domain wall in the intermediate coupling is reported in ref.@xcite    effects of synchronization of kinks ( i.e. , domain walls ) in a two - lane tasep without langmuir kinetics is investigated by mitsudo and hayakawa.@xcite the asymmetric lane - changing rate between lanes is used . moreover ,",
    "different injection and ejection rates of particles at the boundaries of two lanes are also considered .",
    "the positions of kinks are reported to be synchronized , though the number of particles may be different on these two lanes .",
    "more recently , jiang et al.@xcite introduced langmuir kinetics into one lane of a two - lane system .",
    "this has shown that synchronization of shocks on both lanes occurs when the lane - changing rate exceeds a threshold .",
    "a boundary layer is also observed at the left boundary as a finite - size effect . in their model ,",
    "attachment and detachment of particles are assumed to occur only on one of two lanes , not both , which is unable to realistically describe real two - lane or multi - lane molecular motor traffic .",
    "this paper will investigate the collective effect of attaching and detaching particles on both lanes of a two - lane system with symmetric inter - lane coupling .",
    "in particular , we will focus on the finite - size effects of the system .",
    "the model described in this paper is directly motivated by the dynamics of molecular motors , for instance , unidirectional motion of molecular motors along filaments,@xcite random motor ( e.g. , kinesin ) attachments and detachments to filaments,@xcite and molecular motors freely changing to adjacent filaments.@xcite it is expected that the incorporated process of a tasep , langmuir kinetics and lane - changing can shed light on the study of the traffic of molecular motors and other particle traffic in biology as well as in other areas such as vehicular traffic .    we investigate the effects of the following parameters on density and current profiles : ( i ) different lane - changing rates @xmath1 .",
    "we denote @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is used to represent the number of lane - changing particles and @xmath4 is the length of each lane ( i.e. , the number of cells in each lane ) ; ( ii ) different combinations of attachment ( @xmath5 ) and detachment ( @xmath6 ) rates ( for simplicity , we assume that attachment rate @xmath7 is fixed but detachment rate @xmath8 varies ) ; and ( iii ) different system size @xmath4 , i.e. , the length of each lane . note that as we only consider symmetric lane changing , these two lanes are equivalent .",
    "we compare results obtained from our model when @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( where the two - lane system becomes two separated taseps coupled with langmuir kinetics ) . in this way",
    ", we can more clearly distinguish the effect of different values of @xmath3 on a two - lane system .",
    "finally , mean - field approximation ( mfa ) is presented and used to verify our monte carlo simulations ( mcs ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we give a description of our two - lane tasep model , considering attachment and detachment of particles in both lanes . in section iii",
    ", we present and discuss the results of our monte carlo simulations . in section iv ,",
    "mean - field approximation is presented and the quantitative agreement between the monte carlo simulations and the mean - field theory is confirmed . finally , we give our conclusions in section v.",
    "our model is defined in a two - lane lattice of @xmath11 sites , where @xmath4 is the length of a lane .",
    "we assume that all particles move from the left to the right , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . sites @xmath12 = 1 and @xmath12 = @xmath4 define the left and right boundaries respectively , while a set of sites @xmath12 = 2 , ... ,",
    "@xmath13 is referred to as a bulk .",
    "particles in the system are involved in the following processes : lane selection , particle injection into the first site of a lane , particle detachment from a bulk , particle movement along a bulk , particle lane - changing between bulks , particle attachment to a bulk , and particle ejection from the last site of a lane .",
    "thus , we assume that a particle that is injected to a lane and moves along the lane may be involved in the following processes :    * lane selection : a lane is randomly chosen .",
    "* particle injection : if the first site of the selected lane is unoccupied , a particle will be injected to the site with probability @xmath14 . *",
    "particle detachment : a particle can leave the system with probability @xmath15 .",
    "* particle movement : if a particle can not leave the system , it can move forward to the next site in the same lane provided that the next site is empty . if the next site is not empty , the particle can not advance . in this case , the particle will check if it can change to the other lane . *",
    "particle lane - changing : the particle may change to the corresponding site on the other lane with probability @xmath1 if the corresponding site on the other lane is unoccupied . *",
    "particle attachment : if a site in a bulk is empty , a particle can attach to the site with probability @xmath16 . *",
    "particle ejection : if a particle reaches the last site of a lane , it will be ejected from the system with probability @xmath17 .",
    "the above processes can be described using the following updating rules .",
    "as the two lanes are equivalent , they have the same updating rules .",
    "we only list the updating rules for lane 2 . an occupation variable ( @xmath18 )",
    "denotes the state of the @xmath12th site in the @xmath19th lane , where @xmath20 ( or @xmath21 ) corresponds to whether the site is occupied ( or empty ) .",
    "thus , @xmath22 refers to the state of site @xmath12 on lane 2 .",
    "the rules are :    * case @xmath23 .",
    "( i ) if @xmath24 , a particle enters the system with probability @xmath14 ; ( ii ) if @xmath25 and @xmath26 , then the particle in the site of @xmath27 moves into site @xmath28 ; ( iii ) if @xmath25 and @xmath29 , then the particle in the site of @xmath27 stays there .",
    "no lane change occurs . *",
    "case @xmath30 .",
    "if @xmath31 , the particle leaves the system with probability @xmath17 . no lane change occurs .",
    "* case @xmath32 .",
    "( i ) if @xmath33 , the particle may leave the system with probability @xmath15 ; if it can not leave the system , it moves into site @xmath34 provided @xmath35 .",
    "if the particle can not advance , it may change to lane 1 with probability @xmath1 if @xmath36 ; ( ii ) if @xmath37 , a particle enters the system with probability @xmath16 .",
    "these updating rules for both lanes are illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . for simplicity",
    ", we use a symmetric lane - changing rule .",
    "it will be the next step of our work to investigate the effects of asymmetric lane - changing rates on the dynamics of interacting particles .    normally , there are three types of updating schemes:@xcite ( i ) in parallel .",
    "updating rules are synchronously applied to all sites .",
    "a typical application is in vehicular traffic flow ; ( ii ) in ordered sequence .",
    "positions of particles are updated in an ordered sequential manner , e.g. , from one end to the other end of a one - dimensional system ; ( iii ) in random .",
    "a site is randomly chosen and it is updated according to updating rules .",
    "here we use a randomly sequential updating scheme , i.e. , the third scheme , which has been widely used in the simulations of molecular motor traffic.@xcite",
    "in this section , the results of monte carlo simulations are presented .",
    "the average current ( @xmath38 ) is given by : @xmath38 = @xmath39(1 - @xmath40 .",
    "the parameters are set to @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath7=@xmath46*@xmath8 . in simulations ,",
    "stationary profiles are obtained by averaging @xmath47 samples at each site .",
    "the sampling time interval is @xmath48 .",
    "the first @xmath49 time steps are discarded to let the transient time out .",
    "for the special case when @xmath50 , the two - lane process is reduced to two separated processes : two one - lane tasep with langmuir kinetics .",
    "features of a one - lane tasep with langmuir kinetics have been well studied in ref.@xcite    fig .",
    "2 shows average density @xmath51 and current @xmath52 of one lane of a two - lane system for different values of @xmath3 . for the special case @xmath10",
    ", the two - lane system reduces to two separated single - lane systems .",
    "when @xmath3 increases from 0 to 1 , we may expect the domain wall always moves in one direction ( either to the left or right ) . however , an unexpected phenomenon has been observed in our simulations : the domain wall first moves to the left slightly , and then moves towards the right with the increase of @xmath3 ( see figs .",
    "2(a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "this process is more clearly captured in figs .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) , where the domain walls for @xmath53 are shown .",
    "one can see that the domain wall moves to the left first when @xmath3 increases from 0 to 0.2 , and then moves towards the right when @xmath54 .",
    "we refer to this feature as the _ jumping effect _ to describe the domain wall ( as well as current curve ) jump to the left and then to the right caused by the particles jumping between the two lanes .",
    "we also find that there is a critical value , @xmath55 , to distinguish the movement direction of the domain wall under certain conditions .",
    "a similar effect occurs in ref.@xcite    when @xmath7 and @xmath8 increase proportionally , the jumping effect becomes weaker ( comparing figs .",
    "2(a ) and ( b)with figs .",
    "4(a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "this implies that the jumping effect is also influenced by attachment and detachment rates .",
    "the jumping effect is also observed in a larger system , e.g. , @xmath56 , ( see fig .",
    "5 ) when @xmath3 is small .",
    "it can be seen that the domain wall moves left when @xmath57 .",
    "when @xmath58 , the domain wall moves right .",
    "for instance , there is an obvious movement towards right when @xmath59 ( see fig .",
    "the critical value @xmath60 of @xmath3 varies with a system size , i.e. , @xmath60 changes from 0.2 to 0.3 when the system size increases from 1,000 to 10,000 .",
    "we have also confirmed that the jumping effect in a two - lane homogeneous tasep coupled with langmuir kinetics is a kind of finite - size effect .",
    "when the system size is very large , e.g. , @xmath61 , in our simulations , the jumping effect almost disappears .",
    "we argue that we need to study and examine finite - size effects , like the jumping effect because the size of a real system is normally not very large .",
    "for example , kinesin protein motors are responsible for long - distance transport in a cell .",
    "the length that a kinesin protein motor travels from its origin to its destination is normally about 100 successive steps on microtubules and the step size of kinesins is about 8nm.@xcite this indicates that a system size below 1,000 is enough to realistically describe the movements of molecular motors . even for a large system , a size @xmath62 is normally adequate for simulation .",
    "thus , a conclusion obtained based on the assumption of an infinite size may not be applicable to any real system .    comparing figs .",
    "2(a ) and ( b ) with figs .",
    "4(a ) and ( b ) , it can be seen that the slopes of domain walls increase with the increase of @xmath7 and @xmath8 proportionally .",
    "this is because when the difference between @xmath7 and @xmath8 enlarges , more particles will attach to these two lanes rather than detach from them .",
    "increasing the value of @xmath3 means more particles have chances to change to the other lane if they can not move forward along the current lane . upon further increasing @xmath3 , it is found that the density decreases , and the locations of shocks shift right slightly ( see figs .",
    "2(a ) and 3(a ) ) .",
    "when @xmath63 ( @xmath64 denotes the position where the density reaches maximum ) , the differences between density profiles are not obvious ( see figs . 2 and 4 )",
    "this suggests that lane - changing rate @xmath3 does not have any obvious effect on the system properties ( e.g. , average density and current profiles ) after the maximum density is reached .    in figs .",
    "2(c ) and ( d ) , and 4(c ) and ( d ) , current profiles are illustrated .",
    "it is found that ( i ) the current decreases with the increase of @xmath3 until it approaches the maximum current ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "when @xmath66 is approximately equal to @xmath39 , the current @xmath67 @xmath39(1 - @xmath68 .",
    "thus , the maximum current @xmath69 0.25 .",
    "we denote by @xmath70 the position where the current reaches the maximum ; ( ii ) when @xmath71 , the current increases when lane - changing rate @xmath3 increases ; ( iii ) when @xmath72 , the current profiles are almost the same for different @xmath3 .",
    "we next investigate the effect of the values of @xmath46 ( @xmath73/@xmath8 ) on average density and current profiles .",
    "we consider the situation in which @xmath7 is fixed but @xmath8 varies .",
    "note that the increase of @xmath46 means the decrease of @xmath8 .",
    "it can be seen that average density increases with the increase of the value of @xmath46 ( see fig .",
    "moreover , the shock moves left and the amplitude increases .",
    "in other words , the width of the transition region decreases .",
    "this may be explained as follows : when the value of @xmath46 increases , the value of @xmath8 decreases proportionally , so that the opportunities for particles to detach from the bulk become smaller .",
    "in this case , more particles will remain in the bulk .",
    "this leads to an increase of average density .    in fig .",
    "6(b ) , the current first increases with the increase of the value of @xmath46 till it reaches the maximum value , and then the current decreases with the increase of the value of @xmath46 . in other words ,",
    "the position with the maximum current moves left and the amplitude increases ( see fig .",
    "6(b ) ) upon increasing @xmath46 .",
    "the current curves can be obtained from equation @xmath38 = @xmath39(1 - @xmath40 , it thus can be seen that the maximum current @xmath65 = 0.25 when densities of two adjacent sites are equal to 0.5 .",
    "when density is higher or lower than 0.5 , the corresponding current is lower than 0.25 .",
    "fig . 7 shows the density and current profiles for different system sizes .",
    "it is found that the width of the transition region decreases as the number of sites is increased ( see fig .",
    "our simulation suggests the boundary layer shows a finite - size effect and will disappear in the limit of an infinite system . the finite - size effect shown in fig .",
    "7(a ) is consistent with that in refs.@xcite in fig .",
    "7(b ) one observes the amplitude in the left boundary enhances when the system size increases .",
    "in this section , a mean - field theory is developed .",
    "the occupation variable ( @xmath18 ) defined in section ii is also used .",
    "the corresponding equation for the evolution of particle densities @xmath74 in a bulk ( i.e. , @xmath75 can be written as    @xmath76    @xmath77    where @xmath78 denotes a statistical average .",
    "the term @xmath79 is the average current from site @xmath12 in lane 1 to site @xmath12 in lane 2 , while @xmath80 is the average current from site @xmath12 in lane 2 to site @xmath12 in lane 1 .",
    "the first two terms in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) correspond to particle movement ; the middle two terms correspond to particle lane changing , and the last two terms correspond to attachment and detachment of particles . at the boundaries , the densities evolve as @xmath81 @xmath82 where @xmath19 can be 1 or 2 .",
    "it can be seen that eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are equivalent when we use the same lane - changing rate between two lanes .",
    "therefore , we only focus on the mean - field approximation in lane 2 ( i.e. , eq .",
    "when @xmath4 is large , i.e. , @xmath83 , we can transfer the coarse - grained stationary - state eq .",
    "( 2 ) to continuum mean - field approximation .",
    "first , we factorize correlation functions by replacing @xmath84 and @xmath85 with @xmath86 and @xmath87 , then we set @xmath88    substituting ( [ m5 ] ) into eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we obtain @xmath89 where @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 . the term @xmath94 is replaced by @xmath95 , and @xmath96 is approximated as @xmath97 ; similarly , the term @xmath98 is replaced by @xmath99 , and @xmath100 is approximated as @xmath101 .",
    "the boundary conditions become @xmath102 and @xmath103 . as",
    "lane - changing is symmetric and two lanes are homogeneous , we have @xmath104 ( our monte carlo simulations show that densities in lanes 1 and 2 are the same ) . thus , eq . ( 6 )",
    "reduces to @xmath105    in the limit of @xmath106 , the system reaches a stationary state with @xmath107 = 0 , eq .",
    "( 7 ) simplifies into    @xmath108    eq .",
    "( [ m8 ] ) is a first order differential equation and has been solved in ref.@xcite the low - density profiles in the bulk can be obtained by integrating the equation from the left boundary @xmath109 to a density @xmath110 : @xmath111.\\ ] ] similarly , we can also integrate the equation from the right boundary @xmath112 to a density @xmath113 : @xmath114,\\ ] ] where @xmath115 .",
    "the overall density profile across the system can be described by determining a shock position in these two profiles . in fig .",
    "8 , we compare the results of mean - field approximation ( mfa ) with the results of monte carlo simulations ( mcs ) .",
    "we find that the results of monte carlo simulations are in agreement with that of mean - field approximation .",
    "we note that numerical results of mcs in figs .",
    "8(a ) and ( b ) are almost the same as figs . 2 and 5 in ref.,@xcite which also suggests that lane - changing rate @xmath3 has no effect on density profiles of a two - lane tasep coupled with langmuir kinetics at a large attachment / detachment rate and/or a large system size .",
    "in this paper , two - lane totally asymmetric exclusion processes coupled with langmuir kinetics on both lanes are studied using monte carlo simulations ( mcs ) and mean - field approximation ( mfa ) .",
    "the results of monte carlo simulations agree with the results of mean - field approximation . the model is directly inspired by the experimentally observed movement of molecular motors which include motor advancing along filaments , random attachment and detachment , and free jumping between filaments .    the system has mainly demonstrated the following complex behavior on two lanes .",
    "* the _ jumping _ effect is observed , that is , the domain wall first moves left slightly , and then move towards the right with the increase of the lane - changing rate .",
    "this effect is a finite - size effect as it is not observed when the system is large , e.g. , @xmath61 .",
    "on the other hand , increasing attachment and detachment rates proportionally will lead to the _ jumping _ effect becoming weaker . *",
    "after densities reach maximum , the increase of the lane - changing rate has little effect on the system properties such as average density and current . *",
    "when @xmath7 ( attachment rate ) is fixed , it is found that average density and current increase and then the current lowers upon decreasing the value of @xmath8 ( detachment rate ) .",
    "* when system size @xmath4 is increased , the amplitude of the shock increases and average density increases .",
