    "apparent superluminal motion is one of the key results to emerge from very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) . since its initial detection in 1971 @xcite ,",
    "the number of compact radio sources where components appear to move apart at a transverse velocity that exceeds the speed of light has been increasing rapidly @xcite .",
    "insofar as they confirm relativistic jet speeds , measurements of superluminal motion are integral to our current explanations of the high energies inferred for quasars .",
    "the most widely accepted explanation of superluminal motion @xcite postulates a collimated pair of jets of plasma expanding from the nuclear region of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) . if one of these jets is pointed close to our line of sight , contraction of the apparent time scale creates the illusion of superluminal transverse motions . for a jet oriented at an angle @xmath5 relative to the observer ,",
    "a pattern moving at @xmath6 down the jet will appear to be moving at a speed @xmath7 , which can greatly exceed unity , reaching a maximal value of @xmath8 when @xmath9 . `` doppler favoritism , '' the boost in the flux from such a closely aligned jet , makes superluminal sources some of the brightest in the radio sky .",
    "even as the number of known superluminal sources has been rising , many of the basic questions about them remain open .",
    "this is in large part due to a number of difficulties in measuring proper motions with precision .",
    "experiments with _ ad hoc _ arrays can be difficult to set up and are difficult to repeat at regular and frequent intervals . they are usually made at only one frequency with no polarization information .",
    "they often have sparse ( u , v)-coverage and use different sets of dissimilar antennas over different epochs . with the exception of a few , well observed sources , most of the known proper motions are subject to at least some of these problems .",
    "all the issues listed above impact on the fundamental problem in proper motion study - the identification of components ( i.e. , coherent source structure ) between epochs .",
    "frequent monitoring plays a key role , for example in preventing multiple , quickly moving components from being mis - identified as a single slowly moving component ( sometimes called strobing ) . by providing independent observations , multiple frequencies are very helpful in resolving confusing behavior and adding confidence to component identifications .",
    "polarization information provides additional identifying characteristics to components and can be vital when the source behavior is particularly complex ( see oj287 below , for example ) .",
    "finally , having consistent ( u , v)-coverage from epoch to epoch is important to the consistent calibration and modeling of source structure .",
    "here we present proper motion results from six epochs of vlbi observation of 12 blazars .",
    "these sources were selected from among the most variable sources being monitored by the university of michigan radio astronomy observatory ( umrao ) .",
    "they were chosen to study the rapid evolution of parsec - scale total intensity and polarization structure in the most active blazars .",
    "the observations were made at two month intervals with nrao s ( national radio astronomy observatory ) very long baseline array ( vlba ) at 15 and 22 ghz with full polarization information .",
    "the vlba @xcite is a group of 10 identical telescopes , with identical back - ends , that are located across the united states so as to optimize ( u , v)-coverage .",
    "results from other aspects of this monitoring program have been presented elsewhere ( e.g. @xcite ) and others are in preparation . in particular , the entire dataset in the form of images and tabular data will be presented in ojha et al .",
    "( in prep . )",
    ". we will also explore the total intensity and polarization structure and variability of these sources in a third paper ( ojha et al .",
    ", in prep . ) . a fourth paper ( aller et al .",
    ", in prep . ) will examine the relationship between flux and polarization outbursts and component origin and evolution .",
    "key questions we investigate here include : ( 1 ) how do our observed proper motions compare to those obtained from quasi - annual observations , often made at lower frequencies ( e.g. , @xmath10 ghz ) ? ( 2 ) are there significant non - radial motions of jet components ?",
    "( 3 ) how do the speeds of different components in the same jet compare ? is there a systematic dependence of velocity on position in the jet ? ( 4 ) are there accelerations in the motions of individual jet components , either along the direction of motion or perpendicular to it ?",

    "proper motion results on individual sources are presented in ",

    "we used the vlba to conduct a series of 6 experiments , each of 24 hour duration , at ( close to ) two month intervals during the year 1996 .",
    "the observations were made at 15 ghz ( @xmath112 cm , u - band ) and 22 ghz ( @xmath111.3 cm , k - band ) .",
    "we observed 11 target sources for six epochs and one ( j1224 + 21 ) for only the last five epochs .",

    "they were selected according to the following criteria .",
    "( 1 ) high total intensity : the weakest sources are about 1 jy , the most powerful as much as 22 jy . ( 2 )",
    "high polarized flux : typically over 50 mjy .",
    "( 3 ) violently variable : in both total and polarized intensity .",
    "such sources are likely to be under - sampled by annual vlbi .",
    "( 4 ) well distributed in right ascension : this allowed us to make a optimal observing schedule .",
    "about 112 of the umrao sources meet the first three of the above criterion .",
    "the 12 actually selected were the strongest , most violently variable sources , subject to the fourth criteria .",
    "clearly these sources do not comprise a `` complete sample '' in any sense .",
    "the frequency agility and high slew speeds of the vlba antennas were used to schedule our observations to generate maximal ( u , v)-coverage .",
    "scan lengths were kept short ( 13 minutes for the first two epochs and 5.5 minutes for the last four or five ) , with a switch in frequency at the end of each scan .",
    "in addition , scans of neighboring sources were heavily interleaved at the cost of some additional slew time .",
    "each source was observed for approximately 45 minutes per frequency at each epoch .",
    "the data were correlated on the vlba correlator in socorro , nm . after correlation , the data were distributed on dat tape to brandeis university where they were loaded into nrao s astronomical imaging processing system ( aips ) @xcite and calibrated using standard techniques for vlbi polarization observations , e.g. , @xcite . for a detailed description of our calibration steps",
    "see ojha et al .",
    "( in prep . ) .",
    "the final clean images of our sources present a wealth of information . in many ways , the images contain too much information to be simply parameterized for quantitative analysis .",
    "to study proper motions , we used the model fitting capabilities of the difmap software package @xcite to fit the sources with a number of discrete gaussian components .",
    "the fitting was done directly on the final , self - calibrated visibility data ( i.e. , in the ( u , v)-plane ) . obtaining a discrete list of component properties allows for robust mathematical analysis of proper motions , one of the key goals of our observing program .",
    "operationally , components are simply two dimensional gaussian fits to some or all of the visibility data from a source .",
    "we are agnostic about the physical significance of components .",
    "components which correspond to compact , enhanced regions of brightness in the jet are the easiest to follow for proper motion analysis",
    ". they could be shock induced dense regions traveling along the jet , they could result from variation in the doppler factor as the jet bends , or slight variations in speeds could lead to faster plasma catching up with slower plasma , increasing brightness .",
    "our approach to model fitting was empirical and conservative .",
    "we chose to fit the visibilities instead of modeling in the image plane which was one step removed from the data .",
    "we fit the visibility data with elliptical gaussians ( though point sources were used occasionally ) as this made the fewest assumptions about the nature of the components .",
    "we sought to obtain the simplest possible model , i.e. , the model with the least number of components that gave a good fit to the data as judged by a relative chi - squared statistic .",
    "in addition , for a fit to a source to be considered acceptable we required the components to contain @xmath16 95% of the total flux and a convolution of the model components with the beam to be similar to the clean image of the source . in some cases it was possible to fit an additional component ,",
    "but we have not done so unless its presence led to a significant improvement in the quality of the fit .",
    "several techniques were used to ensure that a fit was not merely a local minimum ; these included trying different starting points and deliberately perturbing the final model .",
    "no attempt was made to `` drive '' the fit towards previous models where such models exist in the literature .",
    "indeed , we intentionally remained ignorant of such models to keep our work unbiased during this part of the analysis .",
    "we did try to maintain consistency between the model - fits , across both epoch and frequency of our observations ; however , the primary goal was always to obtain the best representation of the data in that epoch and at that frequency .",
    "modeling a jet with gaussian components will work best with sources that are dominated by discrete , well separated structures .",
    "we had the most difficulty in fitting sources that have complex morphology with a large fraction of flux in diffuse , extended structures ( e.g. , 3c120 , described below ) .",
    "the relative flux densities , positions , and dimensions of the gaussian components that make up a fit can be strongly correlated , particularly when jet features are closely spaced or poorly defined .",
    "the chief problems that such `` cross - talk '' between components lead to are ( 1 ) poor modeling of weak structures , e.g. , the northern bar in j0738 + 17 , and ( 2 ) poor modeling of structures that are close to each other .",
    "if one of these is very bright , a dimmer companion may have its position seriously skewed , e.g. , component u2 ( k2 ) in 3c279 .",
    "given these issues , it is clear that obtaining a good fit to a source is only the first step ; deciding which components are reliable tracers of the motion of jet structures is critical .",
    "we consider a component to be kinematically useful if it meets the following criteria :    * it is consistent at our two frequencies : the difference in resolution , sensitivity and , occasionally , ( u , v)-coverage ( due to failure of a receiver at one frequency ) often give useful perspectives on the `` reality '' of jet features . occasionally we follow a feature well at one frequency and not the other ; these cases are described in the text and marked in the tables .",
    "* it is consistent over many epochs , either steady in shape and flux or changing smoothly .",
    "we often fit components in a particular part of a jet at only a few of our epochs .",
    "while such transitory components represent real flux in the jet , in this paper we generally do not use such components to derive kinematic information .",
    "* the position of the component can not be strongly biased by a close neighbor .",
    "we have found that position and flux can often be exchanged in the model - fitting of two closely spaced components .",
    "a weak neighbor may have its properties distorted by a strong component , particularly if the one ( or both ) components has a large angular extent ( e.g. , the relationship of u2 ( k2 ) and u1 ( k1 ) in 3c279 ) .",
    "here we use 3c120 to illustrate the above issues in a particularly difficult case . in our sample , this was the most difficult source to model - fit robustly because its structure did not lend itself to simple representation as a collection of well - separated , discrete components .",
    "the intensity near the core declines in a smooth manner , and there is appreciable underlying emission all along the jet .",
    "while there are edges and lumps superimposed on this smooth background , we were able to fit such structures reliably only when they were very prominent .",
    "figure [ f:3c120-model ] displays images at two epochs of 3c120 at both of our frequencies .",
    "images created by clean are compared to those produced by adding the model - fit components to the transform of the model - fit residuals .",
    "the first thing to note is that , even with these difficulties , the two sets of images ( traditional clean and restored gaussian components ) are remarkably similar .",
    "this demonstrates that the model - fit components are , even in this worst case example , an adequate description of the data . the key question is then , to what extent ( if any ) can the components that we have fit be used to trace motions in the jet ? using the criteria stated above , we find that there are three kinds of components in our fit to 3c120 .",
    "first consider the two components lying in the region between @xmath17 and @xmath18  mas from the core , which we have labeled u1a ( k1a ) and u1b ( k1b ) in figure [ f:3c120i ] .",
    "they represent easily identifiable discrete structures , and vary smoothly in position , size , flux , and polarization from epoch to epoch , and between our two observing frequencies .",
    "neither is very close to another bright feature .",
    "thus we use these two components to trace motion in the jet of 3c120 .",
    "next consider the single component that we fit to the region within @xmath17  mas from the core , which at every epoch is a narrow gaussian elongated in the direction of the jet .",
    "while such a component does represent quite well the flux in this region at each epoch , its parameters are not well determined , and it does not vary smoothly in size , flux , position , or polarization from epoch to epoch , or between frequencies .",
    "therefore we do not attempt to extract any kinematic information from this component .    finally , there are the several components that we fit beyond @xmath18  mas from the core .",
    "they represent the flux distribution in this part of the jet quite well , but we were unable to extract any kinematic information from them because ( i ) we can not reliably identify them between our two frequencies and ( ii ) there are so many components in one small region that we can not match them up from epoch to epoch .",
    "hence there are three types of components that we fit to our sources .",
    "the first are well defined , compact , isolated from each other , and clearly identifiable across epoch and frequency .",
    "the second are also fit across epochs and frequencies , but do not represent compact structure in the jet .",
    "such components may be marked on our images and discussed in ",
    "[ s : results ] , but we do not present formal proper motions for them .",
    "the third kind are transitory ( present in a few epochs and often at only one frequency ) , or they are erratic in position , size , flux , and/or polarization ( i.e. , they `` flicker '' ) , or they are simply crowded too close together . while such components surely represent real flux in the jet , we generally do not label them in the images presented in  [ s : results ] , and they are not included in our ( very conservative ) analysis of jet proper motions .",
    "the proper motions presented in  [ s : results ] were calculated using the angular component positions in @xmath19 and @xmath20 relative to the core component , d. the jets are assumed to be one - sided , and d is taken to be the bright component at the end of the jet . by fitting the motions in @xmath19 and @xmath20 independently , we are sensitive to non - radial velocities and accelerations .",
    "we use a parameterized model for the motions in ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) that allows us to simultaneously determine three quantities :    * the angular velocity of the component at our middle epoch , @xmath21 .",
    "this mean velocity should correspond well to the velocity of the component if no acceleration was fit to the data . * the epoch of origin , @xmath22 , assuming this mean velocity is constant with no acceleration . *",
    "any acceleration of the component motion during our observations .    to measure these quantities",
    "we developed the following parameterization for motions in ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) : @xmath23 @xmath24    thus @xmath25 and @xmath26 give the angular accelerations .",
    "the mean angular velocities , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , are given directly , as are the epochs of origin , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "these models were fit to our position versus time data using a @xmath31 minimization routine @xcite . in this procedure , the positions measured at the two frequencies were treated independently , giving us @xmath32 data points for each component .",
    "our computed proper motions are presented in table [ t : motions ] as vector proper motions .",
    "the reported epochs of origin are an average of @xmath33 and @xmath34 weighted by their uncertainties .    in reporting our measured accelerations in table [ t :",
    "motions ] , we resolve the angular accelerations into two components . one component , @xmath35 , is along the nominal velocity direction , @xmath36 , and represents changes in speed of the component during our observations .",
    "the second component , @xmath37 , is taken along , @xmath38 , and represents changes in direction of motion during our observations .",
    "the reader will note that the proper motion plots in ",
    "[ s : results ] contain no error bars on the positions of components .",
    "we found that no simple rule for estimating positional uncertainties applied well to all components or even to a majority of components . applying a more detailed procedure , such as manually varying positional parameters for each component while monitoring relative changes in the @xmath31 statistic , the visual fit with the ( u , v)-data , and the flux distribution in the residual image , is a viable solution when a small number of components are involved .",
    "however , such a procedure still does not address uncertainties due to fundamental changes in the model ( e.g. , changes in the number of components fit in a given epoch ) , possible errors created during the iterative self - calibration and imaging procedure , or jitter in the observed core location . given these issues and the large number of data points for each component",
    ", we decided to use the variance about the best fit to estimate the uncertainties in the fitted parameters . to do this",
    ", we initially set the uncertainty for each data point equal to unity .",
    "a first pass through fitting our parameterized proper motion model gave a preliminary @xmath31 value . taking this preliminary @xmath31 value , we then uniformly re - scaled the uncertainties on the data points so that @xmath39 . a second pass through our fitting procedure then gave us good uncertainty estimates for the velocity , epoch of origin , and acceleration in our models .    as a check on these procedures , we also fit a simpler linear least squares model assuming equally weighted data ( no uncertainties on individual points were necessary ) and no acceleration .",
    "the velocities and epochs of origin ( as well their estimated uncertainties ) for most components were nearly the same as the values obtained by our more detailed procedure .",
    "in a few components , the difference in component velocity and epochs of origin between the two procedures was larger , but was still within the estimated uncertainties .",
    "an interesting statistic is the root mean square variation in position about our fit component trajectories .",
    "we computed this statistic with the accelerations set to zero , so the rms variation is a good upper bound estimate of component position uncertainty _ and _ any jitter in the core position ( relative to which the component positions are determined ) .",
    "we find the rms variation in position to be typically @xmath40 milli - arcseconds with a number of smaller values ( @xmath41 mas ) and a few larger values ( @xmath42 mas ) .      throughout this paper",
    "the structural position angle is denoted by @xmath43 , while @xmath36 is the proper motion position angle .",
    "angular separation from the core is denoted by @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath44 .",
    "angular proper motion is given by @xmath45 and angular acceleration by @xmath46 ( for definition of @xmath35 and @xmath37 see  [ s : compute ] ) .",
    "the components are labeled u1 ( k1 ) , u2 ( k2 ) @xmath47 on the 15 ghz ( 22 ghz ) images , in order of emergence , with the earliest labeled u1 ( k1 ) .",
    "the core is labeled d. sometimes a component that is picked up beyond u1 ( k1 ) at a later epoch is labeled u0 ( k0 ) . in all calculations",

    "this systematic position shift is also apparent in figure [ f : j1927 + 73pl ] for component k3 ( u3 ) .",
    "both pieces of evidence suggests a core shift between @xmath355 and @xmath346 ghz of @xmath356 mas .",
    "this source is unique as the only source in our sample whose components show no discernible proper motions .",
    "the process of modeling and understanding this source was also a reminder of the pitfalls of modeling single frequency observations  our 22 ghz modeling by itself leads to an interpretation that is plausible but probably incorrect .",
    "j2005 + 778 is a bl lacertae object at a redshift of 0.342 where a proper motion of 1 mas / yr corresponds to an apparent speed of @xmath357c .",
    "vlbi images by @xcite and @xcite show a jet at @xmath358 .",
    "they identify a component that has a proper motion of @xmath359 mas / yr , corresponding to @xmath360 .",
    "@xcite see a similar structure and fit their image with six components . by identifying one of their components with that of @xcite and @xcite , they calculate a proper motion of @xmath361 mas / yr , corresponding to @xmath362 over @xmath363 years .",
    "our images ( see figure [ f : j2005 + 77i ] ) show a jet extending @xmath364 mas at @xmath365 . at 22 ghz the data appear to be well fit with three components , the core , k1 , and k2 .",
    "if we confine our analysis to 22 ghz , we find that k1 and k2 are moving with jerky but distinctly superluminal apparent speeds comparable to those found by @xcite ( see figure [ f : j2005 + 77pl ] ) .    at 15 ghz ,",
    "the core region is fit with two components , d and u3 .",
    "all the jet components , u1 , u2 , and u3 are stationary in the radial direction ( motions are listed in table [ t : motions ] ) . for reasons we do not understand",
    ", no k3 corresponding to u3 could be fit at 22 ghz , although u3 seems to be robustly fit at 15 ghz .",
    "the radial proper motions observed at 22 ghz correspond very nearly to confusing the core at 22 ghz with u3 in the early epochs and with the 15 ghz core during the later epochs ( see figure [ f : j2005 + 77xy ] ) !",
    "thus we conclude that there is no radial motion in any component . the only observed proper motion is for u1 ( and k1 after we remove the false radial motion ) .",
    "it appears to be moving due south at @xmath366 .",
    "this southward motion is unlikely to be actual motion of the component .",
    "it is probably a shift in the centroid of brightness in a large , low surface - brightness component .",
    "out of our sample of 12 blazars , we found proper motions in 11 sources , 10 of which are superluminal .",
    "three sources ( total of five components ) display transverse speeds larger than @xmath367c , and four other sources ( seven components ) display speeds larger than @xmath368c .",
    "this strongly supports the agn paradigm that requires highly relativistic motion near the base of a blazar jet .",
    "the only source where we did not detect superluminal motion is j2005 + 77 , where none of its three components appear to propagate .",
    "one goal of our program was to compare our range of observed motions to those published in the literature .",
    "the range of previously published motions is summarized in the individual source sections . in figure",
    "[ f : oldmotions ] we compare this range of speeds with our range of speeds for each source .",
    "we find the best agreement for 3c273 , which has been frequently observed in the past and to which we are able to fit and follow a large number of components .",
    "it is interesting to note that we get this agreement without following any of the same components previously reported on in the literature . in general",
    ", we observe a much narrower range of motions than exist in the literature .",
    "this may simply result from our short time baseline and the fact that we follow a small number of components .",
    "there are four sources with obvious disagreement in range of motions : oj287 , j1224 + 21 , j1927 + 73 , and j2005 + 77 .",
    "we find oj287 to have a larger speed than previously observed , even though the well sampled observations of @xcite include our epochs .",
    "while their observations were at @xmath342 ghz , the transatlantic baselines in their array gave them a resolution approaching ours at @xmath355 ghz with the vlba .",
    "they may have found only slower speeds because they did not have polarization observations to resolve confusion and help identify the fast moving component we observe .",
    "our observations suggest that oj287 also has slower speeds in the jet , but we do not follow those components well enough to calculate robust motions . for j1224 + 21 ,",
    "our motions are much faster than those in the literature ; however , the only previously published result is tentative and based on only two epochs . in j1927 + 73 , our upper limits of motions agree with the lower limits from well sampled previous observations .",
    "the previous observations are prior to 1990 , and the source may simply exhibit a wide range of motions . in the case of j2005 + 77 , we also find slower proper motions ( no motion ! ) than previously published .",
    "again , variability may be an issue , as the earlier observations were all prior to 1990 ; however it is also important to note that the previous observations were at @xmath10 ghz which probes different physical scales than do ours .",
    "although our source sample is small and not complete , it is interesting to examine the connection of apparent speed to optical identification",
    ". @xcite find that vlbi component speeds are systematically slower in bl lacs than in quasars ; however , @xcite do not find strong evidence of such a dichotomy .",
    "figure [ f : hist1 ] is a histogram of all the components for which we have measured proper motion .",
    "a straight kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test shows no significant difference between the distributions of quasar and bl lac component speeds , with a probability of @xmath369 that they are drawn from the same distribution .",
    "if we consider only the highest speed component in each source , the sample sizes are simply too small ( @xmath18 bl lacs and @xmath370 quasars ) for a valid k - s test .",
    "non - radial motion is the motion of a component along a position angle that differs significantly from its structural position angle relative to the core .",
    "apparent non - radial motions may result from bent jet trajectories and/or centroid shifts due to flux or morphological changes in a component .",
    "figure [ f : nonrad_hist ] is a histogram of the non - radial motions in our observations .",
    "most component motion is not significantly non - radial ( 12 components are @xmath371 ) .",
    "there are two cases of borderline significance ( @xmath372 ) , and seven significant ( @xmath373 ) non - radial motions .",
    "four of the significant non - radial motions have @xmath374 ( 3c120 has a component at @xmath375 which falls in the bin just under @xmath236 in figure [ f : nonrad_hist ] . ) .",
    "two of these large , non - radial motions are in 3c279 , one is in 3c120 , and the largest ( nearly @xmath376 ) is in j0530 + 13 .",
    "examining table [ t : motions ] , it appears that the outer - most component in j2005 + 77 has a non - radial motion of nearly @xmath377 ; however , as explained in section [ s : j2005 ] , this motion is almost surely due to a centroid shift in this large , low surface brightness component between epochs 1996.23 and 1996.41 .    related to the issue of non - radial motion is the existence of radial motion of two or more jet components along distinctly different structural position angles in a given source .",
    "the clearest case of this phenomenon is j1927 + 73 , though the inner four components of 3c273 also appear to be moving radially at slightly different ( but significantly so ) structural position angles .",
    "j1224 + 21 also appears to have motion along slightly different position angles in its jet ; some of those motions are also slightly non - radial . in j1224 + 21",
    ", the proper motion position angles of the components increase from @xmath281 to @xmath282 with increasing radius .",
    "interestingly , we detected a significant , perpendicular acceleration ( see below ) in one of the components that is consistent with this change in proper motion position angle with radius .",
    "there is also a significant acceleration which changes the trajectory of a component in j1927 + 73 ( see below ) .    in examining the pattern of structural position angles down the jet , only j1224 + 21 , 3c273",
    ", j1927 + 73 , and j2005 + 77 have three or more jet components that we follow well . in j2005",
    "+ 77 , the outer two jet components lie along the same position angle , while the inner - most component differs from them by @xmath378 . in both j1224 + 21 and j1927 + 73 , all three jet components lie in a steady progression of position angle with radius spanning @xmath379 . in 3c273 ,",
    "the outer four jet components lie in a steady progression of position angle with radius spanning @xmath380 ; however , this trend is reversed by the inner - most jet component . taken together",
    ", these cases might suggest a slow oscillation in component ejection angle ; however , with such small statistics , components may simply be located at random position angles within a cone of broader emission .",
    "accelerations in the motions of individual jet components have been reported in the literature e.g. , @xcite , and here we consider both accelerations along a component s velocity , @xmath35 ( speeding up or slowing down ) , and perpendicular to it , @xmath37 , i.e. , `` bending '' accelerations that change a component s trajectory .",
    "section [ s : compute ] contains the details of our component motion fitting including acceleration .",
    "we were unable to detect significant accelerations in most components ( see table [ t : motions ] ) .",
    "there were four components with borderline significant ( @xmath381 ) accelerations and three components with significant ( @xmath373 ) accelerations . in table",
    "[ t : motions ] we have marked the borderline and significant accelerations by underlining or boxing , respectively .",
    "one difficulty we have with measuring reliable accelerations is our short total time baseline ( 1 year ) .",
    "it is no surprise , therefore , that two of our three significant accelerations were found on sources for which we had an extra epoch of observation ( 1997.94 ) .",
    "we have no clear cases of individual components speeding up in their motions , although there are hints of such an accelerated motion in the inner - most components of both j1224 + 21 and 3c279 ( see  [ s : j1224 ] and  [ s:3c279 ] ) . for both sources",
    ", we have the difficulty of confusion with the strong core which may bias the position of the innermost jet component in some epochs .    in 3c279 component k1",
    "appears to be slightly ( but significantly ) decelerating in its outward motion . combined with the @xmath382 non - radial motion of this component",
    ", it appears that k1 ( u1 ) is either interacting with the external medium or its `` tail '' component , k2 ( u2 ) , is catching up as described in  [ s:3c279 ] .",
    "there are two components that appear to have significant bending accelerations .",
    "one of these is component k2 ( u2 ) in the source j1224 + 21 , and the acceleration is in the right direction to align its motion with larger scale jet structure .",
    "the other component with a significant bending acceleration is component k2 ( u2 ) of j1927 + 73 which appears to have a bending acceleration directed toward the structural position angle of the nearby component , k1 ( u1 ) , suggesting collimation .      related to the idea of accelerations in the motions of individual components are different component speeds for different components down the jet .",
    "figure [ f : mu_r ] is a plot of component velocity versus projected radial distance from the core for our sample . of six sources for which we report significant proper motions in more than one jet component ,",
    "five show significantly different velocities between at least some components . in all five of these sources ,",
    "the inner - most component is the slowest component in the source .",
    "this may be evidence for systematic acceleration along the jet , perhaps from a change in jet velocity ( e.g. , @xcite ) or a change in jet trajectory which may bend towards the optimum angle for superluminal motion . from figure",
    "[ f : mu_r ] any such acceleration appears to happen very close in , within the first few parsecs as viewed in projection .",
    "while there is the possibility of acceleration in the inner - most components of j1224 + 21 and 3c279 , we do not robustly observe the rapid acceleration of a single component near the core in any source .",
    "we have presented proper motions for 11 highly active blazars from a six epoch bi - monthly monitoring program with the vlba at 15 and 22 ghz .",
    "only one source ( j2005 + 77 ) in our sample has no clearly observed superluminal components . of the remaining 10 sources ,",
    "three ( five components ) have @xmath383 requiring @xmath384 of at least @xmath1 in these sources .",
    "four other sources ( seven components ) have @xmath385 . for eight sources",
    ", we were able to compare our ranges of observed motions to those found in the literature .",
    "our best agreement in range was in 3c273 , for which we were able to follow five superluminal components . for four sources ,",
    "we find motions well outside the range of those previously observed ; some of our speeds or higher , others are lower .    in five of six sources",
    "for which we measure significant proper motions in multiple components , we see distinctly different speeds along the jet .",
    "the innermost component is always the slowest , suggesting that acceleration takes place along the jet .",
    "we have no clear cases of individual components speeding up in their motions , although there are hints of such an accelerated motion in the inner - most components of both j1224 + 21 and 3c279 .",
    "we do observe at least one decelerating motion and two bending accelerations which tend to align their motions with larger scale structure .",
    "we have also investigated trajectories of the moving components in our sample .",
    "we find most proper motion to be radial , with components in j0530 + 13 , 3c120 , and 3c279 being the most significant examples of non - radial motion . in at least two sources",
    "there are components moving radially at significantly different structural position angles .",
    "finally , we demonstrate the benefit of high frequency observations at closely spaced intervals to accurately measure large proper motions .",
