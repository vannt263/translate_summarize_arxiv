    "one of the most remarkable theoretical discoveries of recent decades was that of black hole evaporation by hawking @xcite in 1974 .",
    "this discovery demonstrated that a black hole emits a ( filtered ) thermal spectrum of radiation , and will eventually cease to exist as a classical black hole .",
    "however , hawking s derivation of this effect and most of the subsequent papers on the topic have dealt only with the mean flux of radiation emitted by the black hole .",
    "there should in addition be fluctuations of the flux , which will be the topic of this paper .    in order to discuss the fluctuations in the components of the stress tensor ,",
    "it is necessary to be able to define the expectation value of the square of a stress tensor component . as will be discussed in the following section ,",
    "this is a more difficult problem than the definition of the expectation value of the stress tensor operator itself . in flat spacetime ,",
    "one possibility is to normal order the product of stress tensor operators .",
    "this gives a meaning to quantities such as the square of the energy density or pressure at a spacetime point and hence to a local measure of the fluctuations in these quantites .",
    "it will be shown in sect .",
    "[ sec : no ] that normal ordering here involves dropping both a divergent vacuum term and a divergent , state - dependent , cross term .",
    "the normal ordering approach was adopted in refs .",
    "@xcite , and was generalized to static curved spacetimes by phillips and hu @xcite .",
    "it leads to the correct classical limit in that the expectation value of a squared stress tensor component is the square of its expectation value in the limit that the quantum state is a coherent state .",
    "furthermore , it leads to the prediction that quantum states which exhibit negative energy densities have large energy density fluctuations @xcite .",
    "black hole evaporation necessarily involves negative energy density in that a flux of negative energy going down the horizon is needed to account for the mass loss by the black hole .",
    "thus the results of ref .",
    "@xcite lead us to suspect that there must be large instantaneous fluctuations in the hawking flux .",
    "such large fluctuations can also be inferred on statistical physics grounds , as will be discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : thermalfluct ] . in the present paper",
    ", we will restrict our attention to the hawking flux in the asymptotic region far from the event horizon where spacetime is approximately flat . in sect .",
    "[ sec : ffno ] , this will be done using the normal ordering prescription . in sect .",
    "[ sec:2dmirror ] , a formula will be derived for the squared flux radiated by a moving mirror in two dimensional spacetime . this can be used to discuss the fluctuations in the flux enitted by a black hole in two dimensions . in sect .",
    "[ sec:4dbh ] , the corresponding analysis will be carried out for a schwarzschild black hole in four dimensional spacetime . in both cases",
    "it will be shown that there are fractional flux fluctuations of order unity on time scales of the order of the mass of the black hole .    however , there are alternatives to the normal ordering method which involve space or time averages of the stress tensor .",
    "one such alternative was used by barton @xcite to study the fluctuations of the casimir force . in sect .",
    "[ sec : cross ] the possibility of averaging the flux over time in a two dimensional model will be examined . using an integration by parts procedure",
    ", it is possible to define time integrals of the state - dependent cross term .",
    "it will be shown that the mean squared mass of the black hole undergoes a random walk in that its deviation from the square of the mean mass grows linearly in time .",
    "this is true regardless of whether or not the cross term is retained , but the rate of growth due to the cross term is three times that obtained in the normal ordering prescription .",
    "the results of the paper will be summarized and discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : final ] .",
    "in minkowski spacetime we renormalize the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor by subtracting out the minkowski divergence , @xmath0 here @xmath1 denotes the expectation value in the minkowski vacuum state . for quadratic operators ,",
    "this subtraction is just normal ordering .",
    "however , this is not true for the squared energy - momentum tensor . in this paper",
    "we will study the massless , minimally coupled scalar field , for which the energy - momentum tensor is @xmath2 the flux operator @xmath3 has finite expectation values .",
    "the product of a pair of normal ordered quadratic operators , @xmath4 can be expressed using wick s theorem as @xmath5 the first term is fully normal - ordered , the next four are cross terms and the final two are pure vacuum terms .",
    "the flux two - point function for an arbitrary state can written as @xmath6 where the vacuum term @xmath7 is the expectation value in the minkowski vacuum state and @xmath8 is a state - dependent cross term . in the coincidence limit , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are divergent .",
    "we can see that although the off - diagonal components of energy - momentum tensor are finite , their square is divergent and remains so even if @xmath12 is subtracted .",
    "we have cross terms which contain state - dependent divergences .",
    "if we wish to give meaning to the notion of the squared flux as a local quantity , it is necessary to remove this divergence .",
    "one possibility is simply to remove both the vacuum and cross term and define @xmath13 . in the following section , we will consider the normal ordered term alone , and in sect .",
    "[ sec : cross ] , we will return to the issue of whether there is a nontrivial physical content to the cross term .",

    "this correlation function was used by muller and schmid @xcite to discuss cosmological perturbations due to quantum fields and by carlitz and willey @xcite in the context of black hole evaporation . however , for the questions which we wish to pose , it seems more natural to examine the various terms in eq .",

    "we have seen that the flux of radiation from an evaporating black hole undergoes large fluctuations on short times scales .",
    "one approach to the subject of flux flucuations involves the use of normal ordered products of stress tensor operators . in this approach",
    "the squared flux is a finite , local quantity and the hawking flux undergoes fluctuations of order one on times scales of order @xmath242 , the black hole s mass .",
    "these fluctuations can be viewed as esentially statistical fluctuations due to the small mean number of particle emitted by the black hole on this time scale .",
    "however , the subject of stress tensor fluctuations can be a subtle one , and there is another approach in which one retains the state dependent cross term in the product of stress tensor operators .",
    "this term is divergent in the limit that both operators are evaluated at the same point .",
    "consequently , if it is present one can not give a meaning to the local squared flux .",
    "it is , however , still possible to define time integrals of a product of fluxes .",
    "these time integrals may be used to show that , at least in a two dimensional model , the mean square mass of a black hole differs from the square of the mean mass by an amount which grows linearly in time .",
    "furthermore , the rate of growth is four times larger when the cross term is retained as compared to the normal ordering approach .",

    "similarly , they give different predictions for the velocity fluctuations of a material body , such as the mirror discussed in sect .",

    ", we are dealing with thermal radiation ( or filtered radiation ) in the asymptotic region far from the black hole .",
