    "dewetting of fluid films and the ensuing formation of sessile droplets are both part of everyday experience .",
    "moreover these mechanisms are important for the functioning of biological systems as well as for numerous technological processes .",
    "dewetting on homogeneous substrates and the subsequent formation of droplets have been studied both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite in great detail .",
    "both mechanisms can be understood quantitatively within the well established theory of wetting phenomena @xcite .",
    "more recently , wetting and dewetting on structured surfaces receives increasing attention , in particular with a view on controlling the dewetting process on patterned surfaces @xcite as well as in the context of microfluidics @xcite .",
    "chemical patterns consisting of lyophilic and lyophobic patches as well as topographic patterns such as pits and grooves effectively lead to a lateral confinement of wetting films and droplets .",
    "it is well known that confinement modifies the structural and thermodynamic properties of condensed matter . in small scale systems",
    "these finite size effects can either stabilize or destabilize certain structures .",
    "for example , systems exhibiting a long - wavelength instability are characterized by a critical wavelength such that fluctuations with larger wavelengths grow exponentially in time .",
    "this type of instability is suppressed in systems smaller than this critical wavelength . on the other hand",
    ", certain structures can only exist if they are larger than a certain critical size , such as droplets which , at least within classical nucleation theory , have to be larger than the critical nucleus .",
    "this means that certain structures are suppressed by finite size effects , or , to put it differently , the availability of large space can stabilize them .",
    "spinodally unstable flat films show a long - wavelength instability such that the dependence of their stability on the substrate size is obvious .",
    "droplets of nonvolatile fluids , however , are usually considered to be stable .",
    "but they are in chemical equilibrium with an adsorbate or a wetting film connected to them @xcite which , on very large substrates , acts like a reservoir : a spherical droplet of @xmath0  nm radius has the same volume as an adsorbate layer with an effective thickness of 1    on a substrate of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , an isolated droplet of a _ nonvolatile _ fluid placed on a macroscopically large substrate is expected to be unstable with respect to the formation of a film . if a droplet is _ volatile _ ,",
    "i.e. , in chemical equilibrium with its vapor , it is expected to be unstable , too , but with respect to evaporation or condensation and the formation of an equilibrium wetting layer .    the laplace pressure in droplets decreases upon increasing their diameter while the pressure in wetting films is determined by the disjoining pressure . in the case of stable films",
    "it increases with their thickness . in a stationary situation",
    "the pressure in the droplet is balanced by the pressure in the connected film . moving a small amount of fluid from a droplet into its attached film increases the pressure in the drop and , as the thickness of the film increases , also the pressure in the film .",
    "however , due to volume conservation , the larger the substrate the smaller is the increase of the ensuing film thickness and therefore the smaller is the increase of pressure in the film .",
    "this implies , that beyond a certain substrate size the pressure increase in the drop is larger than the pressure increase in the film and the drop will dissipate into the large film @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", a substrate of limited size can only support droplets with a base radius smaller than half the substrate diameter .",
    "this means , that one can expect that there is a window of droplet sizes for stable droplets as shown for two - dimensional droplets with small slopes ( i.e. , liquid ridges with a small contact angle ) in ref .",
    "since droplet volumes scale with the third power of the droplet radius while the volume of the wetting or adsorbate film scales with the second power of the substrate diameter , the influence of the wetting or adsorbate film on droplet stability is most important on the nanoscale because in this case the volumes of the liquid in the droplet and in the film are comparable . in addition , due to the non - vanishing width of the three - phase - contact line there is a minimal size for well defined droplets @xcite , which gives rise to an additional contribution to the finite size effects .    in this spirit , here we study the influence of substrate size on the stability of flat films and of droplets using the framework of density functional theory within the sharp kink approximation , i.e. , by minimizing the corresponding effective interface hamiltonian @xcite in the presence of an effective interface potential @xcite .",
    "within the capillary model for nonvolatile fluids @xcite interfaces and contact lines are geometrical objects of zero volume and area , respectively , and the free energy of a fluid in contact with a substrate is given by bulk , interface , and line contributions which are proportional to the volume , interface areas , and contact line lengths , respectively . within this macroscopic model ,",
    "finite size effects occur only if the three - phase - contact line of a droplet reaches the lateral boundary of the substrate .",
    "wetting transitions and the dependence on temperature and pressure of the thickness of wetting layers can not be described within this macroscopic model .",
    "for this reason , in order to access mesoscopic scales , we resort to the effective interface model as the simplest non - trivial model to describe a fluid in contact with a substrate .",
    "it can be derived from a classical density functional theory using the so - called sharp - kink approximation @xcite . as in the capillary model ,",
    "also in this approach interfaces are only two - dimensional manifolds but contact lines , such as the three - phase - contact line between fluid , vapor , and substrate have a nonzero width as a result of explicitly taking into account the finite range of intermolecular interactions ( for reviews see refs .",

    "we have studied the stability of nonvolatile flat films and droplets on smooth and chemically homogeneous substrates with finite surface area @xmath4 . the analysis is based on density functional theory within the so - called sharp kink approximation , i.e. , by minimizing the effective local interface hamiltonian with the effective interface potential shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_eip_model ] .",
    "the stability of flat films and of nano - droplets is strongly affected by finite size effects .",
    "we have shown that in these systems ( i ) spinodal dewetting can occur only if the substrate area @xmath4 is large enough to support the shortest unstable wavelength , ( ii ) there is a minimal size for droplets connected to a surrounding wetting layer , ( iii ) droplets are unstable with respect to drainage into a connected wetting films if the substrate area is too large , and ( iv ) that fluctuations of the droplet shape under the constraint of a fixed volume are more likely than volume fluctuations .",
    "our findings are manifestations of the general rule that long - wavelength instabilities are suppressed by finite size effects .",
    "the shortest instability wavelength @xmath96 of spinodal dewetting depends on the material properties , i.e. , on the surface tension @xmath7 and on the effective interface potential @xmath8 , as well as on the average film thickness @xmath306 , whereas @xmath24 is the conserved total liquid volume .",
    "in particular for film thicknesses close to inflection points of @xmath8 and for thick films this wavelength becomes very large .",
    "for differentiable effective interface potentials the second derivative has a maximum ( typically at a thickness of a few @xmath103 where @xmath341 ) .",
    "therefore the spinodal wavelength @xmath342 of films with the corresponding thickness has a minimum .",
    "experimentally spinodal wavelengths of the order of microns have been reported @xcite .",
    "this means that spinodal dewetting can be suppressed by structuring the surface , e.g. , by a periodic pattern of hydrophilic and hydrophobic stripes , the latter ones with a width smaller than @xmath342 .",
    "the width of the hydrophilic stripes which is necessary to stabilize the film has to be determined separately .",
    "we have calculated the shape of nano - droplets numerically as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_nanodrops ] and we have determined the thickness @xmath134 of the wetting film on which the nano - droplet resides ( see table  [ table ] ) . using a subset of trial function for the droplet shape which are parameterized by the contact angle of the droplet and by the wetting film thickness @xmath134 ( see fig .  [ fig_profiles ] ) we have mapped the free energy landscape of the system ( see figs .",
    "[ fig_fmacro ] and [ fig_fvex0.10][fig_as100 ] ) .",
    "in contrast to macroscopic drops ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_fmacro ] ) , for nano - droplets the influence of the wetting film to which they are connected can not be neglected .",
    "if the excess volume @xmath343 is fixed , there is a minimal substrate size below which no droplet solutions exist ( see fig .  [ fig_dhf - laplace ] ) .",
    "conversely , for a fixed substrate size @xmath4 one can find droplet solutions only above a critical ( excess ) volume ( see figs .",
    "[ fig_fvex0.06 ] and [ fig_as100-laplace ] ) .",
    "this is reminiscent of classical nucleation theory which also leads to the notion of a critical nucleus size .",
    "however , in the latter case one usually considers unbounded systems such that one can not obtain stable droplet solutions at all . in the present case",
    ", the conserved total volume of fluid is distributed between a finite sized wetting film and a droplet ; this allows for stable droplet solutions .    as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ maxwellfig ] the volume @xmath24 ( or excess volume @xmath344 ) at which the free energy of the flat film solution ( a film of homogeneous thickness @xmath306 ) equals the free energy of the stable droplet ( indicated by a thin vertical line in fig .  [ fig_as100-laplace ] ) can be determined by a maxwell construction .",
    "this construction is based on the observation that the lagrange multiplier @xmath25 ( i.e. , the pressure difference between the liquid and the vapor phase ) is given by @xmath345 , i.e. , by the partial derivative with respect to the chosen total volume @xmath24 ( see eq .  ) .",
    "the size of the smallest possible droplet increases ( see fig .  [ fig_vd ] ) and the thickness of the wetting film surrounding the droplet decreases upon increasing the substrate area ( see fig .",
    "[ lowercrit ] ) . within a suitable approximation of the free energy we have found that the volume @xmath253 of the smallest possible droplet diverges upon increasing the substrate size @xmath4 as @xmath346 .",
    "the proportionality factor depends on the equilibrium contact angle @xmath110 and for nonzero contact angles it is of the order of unity with @xmath347 as a lower bound ( realized at @xmath348 ) . for @xmath349",
    "this means that the minimal droplet volume on substrates of size @xmath350 , @xmath351 , and @xmath352 equals that of a cube of edge length @xmath353 , @xmath354 , and @xmath355 , respectively . on the same substrate",
    "the volumes of the connected wetting films of thickness @xmath356   fit into cubes of an edge length of @xmath357 , @xmath358 , and @xmath354 , respectively , i.e. , they are much larger .",
    "our results show that nonetheless the finite extent of the substrate surface plays a significant role for the droplet formation and the associated morphological phase transition ."
