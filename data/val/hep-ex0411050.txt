    "measuring purely leptonic decays of heavy mesons allows the determination of meson decay constants , which connect measured quantities , such as the @xmath5 mixing ratio , to ckm matrix elements .",
    "currently , it is not possible to determine @xmath6 experimentally from leptonic @xmath7 decays , so theoretical calculations of @xmath6 must be used .",
    "the most promising of these calculations involves lattice qcd @xcite , though there are other methods @xcite .",
    "measurements of pseudoscalar decay constants such as @xmath8 provide checks on these calculations and help discriminate among different models .",
    "= 3.0 in    the decay diagram for @xmath9 is shown in fig .",
    "[ dptomunu ] .",
    "the decay rate is given by @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the @xmath12 mass , @xmath13 is the mass of the final state lepton , @xmath14 is a ckm matrix element equal to 0.224 @xcite , and @xmath15 is the fermi coupling constant . various theoretical predictions of @xmath8 range from 190 mev to 350 mev @xcite . because of helicity suppression , the electron mode @xmath16 has a very small rate in the standard model @xcite . the relative widths are @xmath17 for the @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 final states , respectively .",
    "unfortunately the mode with the largest branching fraction , @xmath21 , has at least two neutrinos in the final state and is difficult to detect .",
    "the cleo - c detector is equipped to measure the momenta and direction of charged particles , identify charged hadrons , detect photons , and determine with good precision their directions and energies .",
    "muons above 1.1 gev can also be identified .",
    "the detector is almost cylindrically symmetric with everything but the muon detector inside a superconducting magnet coil run at a current that produces an almost uniform 1.0 t field .",
    "the detector consists of a six - layer wire drift chamber at small radius that is low mass , suitable for these relatively low energies .",
    "it is followed by a 47-layer drift chamber ; both chambers use a gas mixture of 60% helium and 40% propane .",
    "these two devices measure charged track three - momenta with excellent accuracy .",
    "the drift chamber also measures energy loss , de / dx , that is used to identify charged tracks below about 0.7 gev @xcite .",
    "after the drift chamber there is a ring imaging cherenkov detector ( rich ) @xcite , that identifies charged particles over most of their momentum range .",
    "the rich is surrounded by a thallium doped csi crystal array consisting of about 8000 tapered crystals , 30 cm long and about 5x5 @xmath22 at the front @xcite .",
    "in this study we use 60 pb@xmath0 of cleo - c data produced in @xmath23 collisions and recorded at the @xmath24 resonance ( 3.770 gev ) . at this energy ,",
    "the events consist of a mixture of pure @xmath25 , @xmath26 and three - flavor continuum events , resulting from the production of @xmath27 , @xmath28 or @xmath29 quark pairs .",
    "there also may be small amounts of @xmath30 pairs and two - photon events .",
    "we examine all the recorded events and retain those containing at least one charged @xmath31 candidate in the modes listed in table  [ tab : drecon ] .",
    "the selection criteria are described in detail in what follows .",
    "we then use this sample to look for cases where we have only a single muon candidate whose four - momentum is consistent with a two - body @xmath31 decay into a muon and a neutrino and no other charged tracks or excess neutral energy are present .",
    "all acceptable track candidates must have a helical trajectory that approaches the event origin within a distance of 5 mm in the azimuthal projection and 5 cm in the polar view , where the azimuthal projection is in the bend view of the solenoidal magnet .",
    "each track must possess at least 50% of the hits expected to be on a track , and it must be within the fiducial volume of the drift chambers , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the polar angle with respect to the beam direction .",
    "we use both charged particle ionization loss in the drift chamber ( de / dx ) and rich information to identify kaons and pions used to fully reconstruct @xmath31 mesons .",
    "the rich is used for momenta larger than 0.55 gev .",
    "information on the angle of detected cherenkov photons is translated into a likelihood of a given photon being due to a particular particle .",
    "contributions from all photons associated with a particular track are then summed to form an overall likelihood denoted as @xmath34 for each particle hypothesis . to differentiate between pion and kaon candidates , we use the difference : @xmath35 ) .",
    "usually this cut is set at zero except for muon candidates where the difference @xmath36 ) is required to be less than 10 , to ensure a high , well understood efficiency . to utilize the de / dx information",
    "we calculate @xmath37 as the difference between the expected ionization loss for a pion and the measured loss divided by the measurement error .",
    "similarly , @xmath38 is defined in the same manner using the expected ionization for a kaon .",
    "we use both the rich and de / dx information for @xmath39 meson tag candidate tracks in the following manner : ( a ) if neither the rich nor de / dx information is available , then the track is accepted as both a pion and a kaon candidate .",
    "( b ) if de / dx is available and rich is not then we insist that pion candidates have @xmath40 , and kaon candidates have @xmath41 ( c ) if rich information is available and de / dx is not available , then we require that @xmath42 for pions and @xmath43 for kaons .",
    "( d ) if both de / dx and rich information are available , we require that @xmath44 for pions and @xmath45 for kaons .",
    "we reconstruct @xmath46 s by first selecting photon candidates from energy deposits in the crystals not matched to charged tracks that have deposition patterns consistent with that expected for electromagnetic showers .",
    "pairs of photon candidates are kinematically fit to the known @xmath46 mass .",
    "we require the pull , the difference between the raw and fit mass normalized by its uncertainty , to be less than three for acceptable @xmath46 candidates .",
    "@xmath47 candidates are formed from a pair of charged pions which are constrained to come from a single vertex .",
    "we also require that the invariant mass of the two pions be within 4.5 times the width of the @xmath47 mass peak , which has an r.m.s .",
    "width of 4 mev .",
    "tagging modes are fully reconstructed by first evaluating the difference in the energy , @xmath49 , of the decay products with the beam energy .",
    "we then require the absolute value of this difference to be within 20 mev of zero , approximately twice the r.m.s .",
    "width , and then look at the reconstructed @xmath39 beam - constrained mass defined as @xmath50 where @xmath51 runs over all the final state particles .",
    "the beam - constrained mass has better resolution then merely calculating the invariant mass of the decay products since the beam has a small energy spread . besides using @xmath39 tags and searching for @xmath52",
    ", we also use the charge - conjugate @xmath12 tags and search for @xmath53 ; in the rest of this paper we will not mention the charge - conjugate modes explicitly , but they are always used .",
    "the @xmath54 distributions for all @xmath39 tagging modes considered in this data sample are shown in fig .",
    "[ drecon ] and listed in table  [ tab : drecon ] along with the numbers of signal events and background events within @xmath553 r.m.s .",
    "widths of the peak .",
    "the event numbers are determined from fits of the @xmath54 distributions to gaussian signal functions plus a background shape .",
    "we fit with two different background parametrizations : ( a ) a @xmath56 order polynomial , ( b ) a shape function analogous to one first used by the argus collaboration @xcite which has approximately the correct threshold behavior at large @xmath54 ; to use this function , we first fit it to the data selected by using @xmath49 sidebands , mode by mode , defined as 40 mev @xmath57 60 mev to fix the shape parameters in each mode allowing the normalization to float . for the @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 modes we use a single gaussian to describe the signal",
    "whose mass and width are allowed to float .",
    "for the @xmath61 and @xmath62 modes , where we see a small tail on the higher mass side , we use the sum of two gaussian s for a signal function @xcite ; in this case both the means and widths of both gaussians are allowed to float .",
