    "recent reviews on the presence of temperature variations in pne have been presented by esteban ( 2002 ) , liu ( 2003 , 2006 ) , and torres - peimbert & peimbert ( 2003 ) . of",
    "the well observed pne about one third can be fitted reasonably well by 1d static chemically homogeneous photoionization models , but two thirds show temperature variations that are substantially larger than those predicted by simple photoionization models . in this paper",
    "we review further evidence in favor of the presence of large temperature variations in pne .",
    "we discuss possible causes for these variations and their effect on the determination of chemical abundances of pne .",
    "we discuss the proper procedure to obtain accurate abundances for chemically homogeneous and for chemically inhomogeneous pne .",
    "peimbert ( 1967 , 1971 ) found that the determinations of @xmath1([o  iii ] ) , the temperatures based on the @xmath2 ratio , are considerably larger than the determinations of @xmath1(balmer ) , the temperatures based on the intensity ratio of the balmer continuum to a balmer recombination line ; he interpreted this result as being due to the presence of temperature variations over the observed volume . to study this problem , peimbert defined the mean square temperature variation , @xmath0 ; typical simple photoionization models yield @xmath0 values in the 0.003 - 0.015 range .",
    "peimbert and collaborators , also developed equations to derive the abundances for chemically homogeneous nebulae with @xmath3 ( peimbert 1967 ; peimbert & costero 1969 , ruiz et al .",
    "2003 , peimbert et al .",
    "the large differences between @xmath1([o  iii ] ) and @xmath1(balmer ) have been confirmed by several authors for a large number of pne ( e.g. liu & danziger 1993 ; zhang , liu , & wesson 2004 ) .",
    "peimbert , storey , & torres - peimbert ( 1993 ) based on the computations by storey ( 1994 ) were the first to obtain larger o@xmath4/h@xmath5 values from oxygen recombination lines than from collisionally excited lines under the assumptions of @xmath0 = 0.000 and of chemical homogeneity .",
    "most pne show this difference which has been usually called the abundance discrepancy factor defined by : adf(o@xmath4/h@xmath5 ) = ( o@xmath4/h@xmath5)@xmath6 / ( o@xmath4/h@xmath5)@xmath7 , ( e. g. liu 2006 , and references therein ) .",
    "the adf(o@xmath4/h@xmath5 ) value is larger than predicted by simple photoionization models for about two thirds of the well observed pne .",
    "a similar abundance difference for c@xmath4/h@xmath5 has been obtained by peimbert , torres - peimbert , & luridiana ( 1995a ) based manly on the line intensities compilation by rola & stasiska ( 1994 ) .",
    "peimbert et al .",
    "( 1995a ) compared the c@xmath4/h@xmath5 abundances derived from the c  ii @xmath8 4267 recombination line with those derived from the c@xmath4 @xmath9 1906 , 1909 collisionally excited lines . again",
    "about one third of the adf(c@xmath4/h@xmath5 ) of the well observed pne might be explained by simple photoionization models but two thirds present values too large to be reproduced by these models .",
    "zhang et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have obtained large @xmath1([o  iii ] ) @xmath10 @xmath1(he  i ) differences for 48 pne that con not be explained by simple photoionization models . in section 4.2 we discuss their results .",
    "torres - peimbert & peimbert ( 2003 ) presented seven mechanisms as possible sources of temperature variations , in what follows we will mention additional results in favor of some of these mechanisms .    _",
    "deposition of mechanical energy : _ the central stars of pne inject mechanical energy into the expanding shells by means of stellar winds , bipolar flows , multipolar flows , and asymmetrical ejections , these processes produce shocks , turbulence , and an increase of the expansion velocity of the shell with time .",
    "these processes are more important for some objects than for others and might be responsible for the spread in the observed @xmath0 values .",
    "guerrero et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and guerrero , chu , & gruendl ( 2006 ) found that the following pne are strong x - ray emitters : bd+30@xmath11  3639 , ngc  40 , ngc  2392 , ngc  3242 , ngc  6543 , ngc  7009 , and ngc  7027 , they also argue that this emission is due to shocks produced by fast winds or bipolar flows .",
    "rowlands , houck , & herter ( 1994 ) derived @xmath1([ne v ] ) @xmath12 50,000 k for ngc  6302 and ngc  6537 , they also computed photoionization models and were not able to produce temperatures higher than 20,000  k and reached the conclusion that these temperatures were indicative of shock heating .",
    "peimbert et al .",
    "( 1995a ) found that the following pne with large velocity dispersions also show large temperature variations : ngc  2392 , ngc  2371 - 2 , ngc  2818 , ngc  6302 , and hu  1 - 2 , the last four are bipolar type  i pne .",
    "medina , pea , & stasiska ( 2006 ) found , from a sample of 47 pne , that the velocity of expansion of the shell increases with age indicators , for example @xmath13 is larger for low density nebulae and it is also larger for nebulae with higher temperature stars .",
    "furthermore by studing the line profiles medina et al .",
    "( 2006 ) find that a substancial fraction of the material shows turbulent motions .",
    "_ chemical inhomogeneities : _ see section 4.2 and the review by liu ( 2006 ) .",
    "_ time dependent ionization : _ when a photoionization front passes through a nebula it heats the gas above the steady state value and some time is needed to reach thermal equilibrium . in the presence of localized density variations or a density gradient this process produces large temperature variations and might explain the presence of hot external halos in pne ( e.g. tylenda 2003 , sandin et al .",
    "when the stellar ionizing flux decreases , or the density distribution along the line of sight changes , the outer regions of a nebula might become isolated from the stellar radiation field and will cool down before fully recombining , creating cold partially ionized outer regions , this might explain the low @xmath1(balmer ) values derived by luo & liu ( 2003 ) in the outer regions of ngc  7009 .",
    "_ density variations : _ extreme density variations are present in most pne , as can be seen from optical images . for steady state photoionization models density variations",
    "are not very important , but for time dependent processes the regions of higher density will reach equilibrium sooner than those of lower density .",
    "_ deposition of magnetic energy : _ no specific models have been proposed yet for this mechanism .    _ dust heating : _ stasiska & szczerba ( 2001 ) have analyzed the effects of photoelectric heating by dust grains in photoionization models of pne .",
    "this effect might be important in nebulae with large density variations .",
    "this suggestion has not been tested yet for a specific model on any given pn .",
    "_ shadowed regions : _ due to the presence of molecular globules inside ngc 7293 and ngc 6720 , two nearby pne , their presence is expected in many pne . according to huggins & frank ( 2006 ) , the covering factor of the globules in ngc 7293 amounts to about 5% .",
    "the ionization of the gas shadowed by the globules will be produced by diffuse radiation , and consequently , the temperature of the shadowed gas will be a few thousand degrees lower than that of the material that is directly ionized by the central star ( mathis 1976 ) .",
    "this mechanism alone might produce @xmath0 values around 0.01 in pne of the type of ngc 7293 and ngc 6720 .    to discriminate among the different possibilities ,",
    "it is important to understand the signature of each process on the temperature and density distributions .",
    "mechanical energy deposition , an increase in the local ionizing flux , and magnetic energy deposition will produce localized high - temperature regions relative to simple photoionization predictions ; while shadowed regions , the decrease of the local ionizing flux , and the presence of metal - rich inclusions will produce localized low - temperatures regions relative to simple photoionization predictions .",
    "abundances correspond to those derived from recombination lines , if forbidden lines are used a @xmath0 different from 0.000 has to be adopted . in what follows we present evidence in favor of chemical homogeneity for most pne .    from chemical evolution models of the galaxy",
    "it has been found that in the solar vicinity about half of the c enrichment of the ism is due to low and intermediate mass stars that end their lives as white dwarfs , and the rest is due to sn of type  ii ( e. g. carigi et al .",
    "moreover according to other models most of the c enrichment is due to low and intermediate mass stars ( e. g. matteucci 2006 ) .",
    "carigi ( 2003 ) has shown that the c / h values derived from c  ii recombination lines are in agreement with these models , while the c / h values derived from the 1906 and 1909 collisionally excited lines , under the assumption of @xmath1([o  iii ] ) and @xmath14 , imply lower c yields than those needed by the galactic chemical evolution models .",

    "we consider that our knowledge on the density and temperature distributions and on the chemical composition of pne will increase considerably from the study of the four following problems .",
    "the @xmath17(o  ii ) values derived from the o  ii lines of multiplet 1 , like those presented in table 3 , need to be determined again based on the atomic physics computations by bastin & storey ( 2006 ) .",
    "objects with small he@xmath18 and he@xmath4 fractions and with most of their o in the o@xmath4 ionization stage will be particularly useful , those objects of this group with @xmath17(o  ii ) @xmath19(balmer ) will be chemically homogeneous , while those with @xmath17(o  ii ) @xmath20 @xmath17(balmer ) will be chemically inhomogeneous .",
    "the idea that there are high density he@xmath5 regions embedded in low density h rich material might be tested by deriving @xmath1(he  i ) , @xmath17(he  i ) , and @xmath21(3889 ) based on accurate measurements of at least 10 different he  i lines in relatively low density pne without substantial he@xmath18 and he@xmath4 regions . those objects with @xmath17(he  i ) @xmath19(balmer ) will be chemically homogeneous , while those with @xmath17(he  i ) @xmath22(balmer ) will be chemically inhomogeneous .",
    "there are at least seven possible mechanisms as sources of temperature variations . from the theoretical side , it is important to model the signature of each process on the temperature and density distributions . while , from the observational side , the combination of 3d kinematical models with high spectral resolution data , like those presented by barlow et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , might permit to derive temperature and density distributions and consequently to single out the main mechanism responsible for the temperature variations in a given object .",
    "finally accurate h , he , c , and o abundances of h - rich central stars , like those obtained by georgiev et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for ngc  6543 , are needed to compare them with those nebular abundances derived from permitted and forbidden lines ."
