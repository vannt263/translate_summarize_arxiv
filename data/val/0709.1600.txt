    "in simulations of the hydrodynamic behavior of complex fluids , one is faced with the challenge of bridging the gap between the mesoscopic length and time scales of the solute and the atomic scales of the solvent . as these length scales typically differ by orders of magnitude , a full treatment on a microscopic level is prohibited by the huge number of involved particles and the large necessary time range . moreover ,",
    "one is often only interested in the dynamics of the colloidal particles , while the microscopic details of the solvent that mediates the hydrodynamic interactions are rather unimportant .",
    "thus , a coarse - grained mesoscopic fluid model is required that is sufficiently simple to be tractable but still captures the correct hydrodynamic behavior .",
    "various mesoscopic approaches have been proposed in the last decades .",
    "a large number of physical solvent molecules is represented by one model fluid particle at a time , reducing the number of degrees of freedoms considerably .",
    "lattice methods , such as lattice gas automata ( lga )  @xcite and lattice - boltzmann methods ( lb )  @xcite , generally suffer from the lack of galilean invariance .",
    "moreover , it is difficult to incorporate complex and deformable boundaries that play important roles in the phase separation of two fluids  @xcite and the dynamics of vesicles and cells  @xcite . in particle - based techniques such as dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd )  @xcite or multi - particle collision dynamics ( mpc )  @xcite , particle positions and velocities are continuous variables that are updated at discrete times . coupling to solute particles as well as moving boundaries can be easily treated .",
    "mpc needs less computational time compared to other particle based methods such as dpd , thus allowing simulations of larger systems .    in this article",
    ", we will focus on mpc , which has been applied to various systems such as colloids  @xcite , polymers  @xcite , membranes  @xcite , ternary amphiphilic fluids  @xcite , and chemical reaction systems  @xcite .",
    "the mpc method naturally contains thermal fluctuations .",
    "hybrid simulations combining a mpc fluid with molecular dynamics ( md ) of solute particles are easily possible .",
    "the algorithm is constructed in such way that mass , energy and translational momentum are locally conserved , which is essential for correct hydrodynamic behavior .",
    "however , the _ angular _ momentum is not conserved in the most widespread version of mpc , which is often called stochastic - rotation dynamics ( srd ) . here",
    "we denote it as mpc - sr .",
    "the consequences of this fact have not yet been investigated and are the subject of this paper . in order to clarify the effects of angular - momentum conservation",
    ", we mainly use the andersen - thermostat version of mpc , denoted mpc - at , where angular momentum conserving and non - conserving algorithms are available  @xcite .",
    "we also checked that the same quantitative dependence appears in the original mpc - sr method .",
    "the main conclusion is , that simulations that do not conserve angular momentum can lead to quantitatively and even qualitatively incorrect results , when the boundary conditions on walls are given by forces , fluids with different viscosities are in contact , or finite - sized objects rotate in fluids .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : fluid_dyn ] , we briefly discuss the effect of the non - conservation of angular momentum on the stress tensor .",
    "note , that while in the mpc fluid the non - conservation of angular momentum is an artifact of the simulation method , there are also real fluids , where angular momentum is not conserved . for example , in ferrofluids asymmetric stress arises  @xcite when the rotation of the suspended particles is impeded by external fields . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sim_met ] , the algorithms for the angular - momentum conserving and non - conserving versions of mpc - at are described .",
    "a simple geometry to study rotating fluids is the flow between rotating coaxial cylinders , also called circular couette flow .",

    "in conventional viscous fluids that do conserve angular momentum , the viscous stress tensor has to be symmetric ,  @xmath0 .",
    "this symmetry is required by the fact that there is no stress expected in a uniformly rotating fluid ( rigid body rotation )  @xcite , or alternatively , by the conservation of angular momentum  @xcite . on the other hand , for a fluid without conservation of angular momentum ,",
    "the above argument is no longer valid and we have to consider in general an asymmetric tensor .    here , we consider newtonian fluids ,  the stress is proportional to the strain rate , so that the @xmath1 are linear functions of the derivatives @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "we decompose the stress tensor in its symmetric and asymmetric parts .",
    "then , the viscous stress is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 .",
    "here , @xmath5 is the second viscosity coefficient , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the symmetric and asymmetric components of the viscosity , respectively . the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : strs ] ) is linear in the vorticity @xmath8 , and does not conserve angular momentum .",
    "thus , the last term vanishes (  @xmath9 ) in angular - momentum - conserving systems .",
    "the equation of velocity evolution is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is lagrange s derivative and @xmath12 is the pressure . when a fluid is incompressible , this is the normal navier - stokes equation with viscosity @xmath13",
    "this is consistent with the usual definition of the shear viscosity @xmath14 in simple shear flow with the velocity field @xmath15 .",
    "since the equations of continuity and velocity evolution are of the same form , the negligence of angular - momentum conservation does not modify the velocity field of fluids when the boundary conditions are given by velocities .",
    "however , it generates an additional torque , so that the velocity field can be changed when the boundary condition is given by forces . in cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath16 ) , the azimuthal stress is given by @xmath17 the first term is the stress of the angular - momentum - conserving fluid , which depends on the derivative of the angular velocity @xmath18 .",
    "the second term is the additional stress from the negligence of angular - momentum conservation and is proportional to @xmath19 .",
    "when a fluid is compressible and the fluid density is not constant , the bulk viscosity is not negligible .",
    "the bulk viscosity without angular momentum conservation is given by @xmath20 instead of @xmath21 .",
    "in angular - momentum - conserving fluids , these two values coincide because @xmath22 .",

    "[ eccentric_force_distribution ] , we present the measured force distribution on the surface of the inner cylinder , where the force due to the isotropic hydrostatic pressure has been subtracted .",
    "the force exerted by the fluid on the cylinder is composed of two contributions : first of all , the shear stress is hindering the counter - clockwise rotation .",
    "this force tangential to the surface is more pronounced in the small - gap region ( top of fig .",
    "[ eccentric_geometry ] and [ eccentric_force_distribution ] ) than in the large - gap region , thus the net force due to viscous stress points in the positive @xmath66 direction ,  to the right in fig .",

    "this in turn induces a force pointing in the negative @xmath66 direction , counteracting the force due to viscous stress and exceeding the latter in strength , hence the total force points to the left .",
    "since the mpc fluid is compressible , density inhomogeneities emerge , but they are sufficiently small that the corresponding local variation of the viscosity is negligible . the density distribution , which is proportional to the pressure distribution , is shown in fig .",

    "[ eccentric_force_distribution].,width=302 ]    .,width=264 ]    next , we study how the results are affected by the lack of angular - momentum conservation .",
    "clearly , for a given external torque , in the mpc - at@xmath28 method the inner cylinder would rotate with an incorrect angular velocity . as this effect",
    "has already been discussed in the preceding section , we fix the velocity on the boundary instead of imposing a constant torque .",
    "we choose the results for the angular velocity obtained from the mpc - at@xmath27 simulations as an input parameter for the mpc - at@xmath28 simulations in order to investigate the influence of the angular - momentum conservation on the resulting velocity field . for comparability , we chose the parameters in such a way that the viscosity @xmath13 is the same for both simulation methods .",
    "we find practically identical velocity fields . in order to quantify the difference",
    ", we calculate the ratio @xmath178 , where @xmath179 and @xmath180 denote the velocity fields obtained by the two different simulation methods , and the average is taken over the simulation box .",
    "although the density distributions for both simulation methods are qualitatively very similar , the density inhomogeneity is slightly less pronounced for mpc - at@xmath28 , giving rise to a smaller pressure gradient .",
    "this is also reflected in the smaller total force acting on the rotating inner cylinder in the mpc - at@xmath28 simulation : for the mpc - at@xmath28 method we find @xmath181 compared to @xmath182 in the mpc - at@xmath27 simulation .",
    "we have investigated the relevance of angular - momentum conservation in mesoscale hydrodynamics simulations .",
    "we have focused on mpc methods , but similar results are also expected in other hydrodynamic methods without angular - momentum conservation , such as dpd@xmath28  @xcite . focusing on fluids confined between rotating cylinders , we compare two simulation variants that only differ in the conservation of angular momentum .    in the bulk , both simulation methods show physically correct flow behavior . here , the negligence of angular - momentum conservation simply leads to a modified viscosity .",
    "however , we find that in situations where torques are acting on surfaces , often quantitative or even qualitative incorrect results are obtained without angular - momentum conservation .",
    "in particular , there are non - physical torques occurring even in the rigid body rotation where no torque is expected .",
    "this can be well understood from basic continuum fluid mechanics as the non - conservation of angular momentum gives rise to an asymmetric stress tensor .",
    "the angular - momentum conservation is essential to be taken into account in the following cases to avoid non - physical torques .",
    "( i ) the boundary condition on walls is given by forces including torques , such as in circular couette flow .",
    "( ii ) finite - sized objects with angular degrees of freedom , or densely distributed point - like objects , rotate in fluids by the hydrodynamic stress , such as in colloidal and polymer suspensions .",
    "( iii ) fluids with different viscosities are in contact .",
    "when the boundary conditions are given by velocities , @xmath28 methods give the correct velocity field .",
    "for example , mpc - sr reproduces the frequency of von karman vortex shedding observed in experiments and other numerical methods ( see the strouhal number in fig . 5 of ref .",
    "thus , the @xmath27 version of mesoscale hydrodynamics methods have to be employed whenever torques play a role in the flow of ( complex ) fluids .",

    ", we use the following simplification : instead of explicitly taking into account all quadratic cells that are intersected by @xmath108 , due to the cylindrical symmetry of the problem it is favorable to consider an annular arc with radial width @xmath26 and area @xmath183 as an adapted collision cell , where @xmath184 is the angular width and the inner or outer radius is @xmath185 or @xmath186 , respectively .",
