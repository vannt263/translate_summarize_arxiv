    "the stability of four - dimensional black holes is a well known , and fundamental result of relativity theory  @xcite .",
    "the picture in higher dimensional spacetimes was shown to be quite different by gregory and laflamme  @xcite , who demonstrated the existence of unstable long wavelength modes of the black string in perturbation theory .",
    "this finding , coupled to arguments based on entropy considerations , led to their conjecture that black strings might bifurcate into higher dimensional analogues of spherical black holes .",
    "cosmic censorship would be violated were this the case , since a singularity must be encountered by a bifurcating black hole horizon , essentially as a consequence of the principle of equivalence  @xcite .",
    "the existence of the gregory - laflamme instability has been assumed in many subsequent studies of higher dimensional gravity theory , including the classical limit of string theory ( see , for example , @xcite ) , some of which have also assumed the validity of the bifurcation conjecture .",
    "however , a linearized analysis can say little , if anything , concerning the nature of the full non - linear evolution of an unstable string , and the final end - state of such a configuration remained to be established .",
    "recently , horowitz and maeda were able to prove , under some assumptions , that black strings can not bifurcate in finite time  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they conjectured that the system is likely to approach a new stationary solution which is not translationally invariant along the string direction . however , even if the assumptions involved in the proof are sufficiently generic , their analysis can not identify the final end - state of evolution .",
    "partial answers can be sought via perturbation analysis as done by gubser  @xcite . by assuming the horowitz - maeda conjecture and linearizing the solution _ at the critical length _ to first order ( and a partial extension to second order )",
    ", gubser argued that the transition to the final solution must be of second order type ( i.e. discontinuous ) . despite these developments",
    ", it seems clear that a convincing answer to the question at hand can only be obtained by solving the full equations governing the problem .",
    "a step in this direction would be to search for special solutions , such as stationary ones , and compare the physical content of the obtained configurations with the black string solutions .",
    "this has recently been carried out by wiseman  @xcite , who numerically solves the equations resulting from a static ansatz .",
    "interestingly , he finds non - uniform solutions with mass larger than that of the black string for a given compactification radius .",
    "thus , he concludes that the solutions he finds can not be the end - states conjectured by horowitz and maeda ( also see related work by kol  @xcite )",
    ".    additional work by unruh and wald  @xcite studies the dynamics of a uniform cylindrical configuration of matter in newtonian gravity .",
    "they observe that a perturbation of the density gives raise to a jeans instability responsible for the collapse of the system along the cylinder s length .",
    "they then argue that if the main features of this model are robust in the passage to the general relativistic system , one possible end - state for the perturbed black string would be collapse in the string direction , resulting in singularity formation .",
    "note that this collapse need not lead to violations of cosmic censorship , as the final singularity could still be hidden by an event horizon  @xcite .",
    "clearly there are several distinct viable possibilities for the final end - state of a perturbed black string , with remarkably different consequences associated with the range of options .",
    "current conjectures range from `` nothing interesting happens '' , to violations of cosmic censorship , to the arguably more extreme case of a complete collapse of the spacetime . in order to completely settle the issue , the full dynamics of the perturbed black string needs to be addressed . at least in principle , this will allow us to identify which of the above possibilities ( if any ! ) is actually realized . in this paper",
    "we report on preliminary work in this direction  a program to simulate the dynamics of the black string through numerical solution of the einstein equations . at this stage of the project",
    ", we can not yet provide an answer to the question of the end - state ; however , we have tantalizing results that show the spacetime going through a configuration resembling 5-dimensional spherical black holes connected by thin black strings that expand along the string dimension",
    ". our simulations eventually crash while the spacetime is still fairly dynamical , and so we can not determine whether what we see is near the end - state , or merely an intermediate configuration in a more complicated evolution .",
    "underlying the current failure of our simulations is the fact that the coordinate system employed is not well adapted to the solution that unfolds at late times , wherein fatally steep gradients develop in metric functions  .",
    "the outline of the remainder of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : setup ] , we begin by describing the equations of motion , our coordinate choices , generation of initial data , as well as our numerical solution scheme . additionally , we also briefly mention the tools we employ to monitor the solution , deferring details to the appendices . in sec . [",
    "sec : results ] we discuss the results obtained with this code , and conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] by mentioning directions for future work that may allow us to more definitively answer questions regarding the end - state of the gregory - laflamme instability .",
    "we wish to solve the vacuum einstein equations in higher dimensional settings . for simplicity , and without loss of generality in studying the gregory - laflamme instability",
    ", we only consider the 5-dimensional case , and restrict attention to spherical symmetry within the 4-dimensional subspace tangent to the `` extra '' dimension .",
    "we also use the natural generalization of the adm decomposition to derive the system of equations that we then solve numerically .",
    "choosing units in which @xmath0 , and adopting mtw  @xcite conventions , our starting point is thus a metric element given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is the 2-spherical line element with coordinates chosen orthogonal to the @xmath4 constant congruences ( hence there is no shift corresponding to angular directions ) .",
    "all metric components defined via ( [ metric ] ) depend upon @xmath5 : @xmath6 is a time - like coordinate , @xmath7 is a radial coordinate , and @xmath8 is the coordinate along the length of the string . to further expedite the numerical implementation , we make @xmath8 a periodic coordinate by identifying @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "then , following the results of gregory and laflamme , we expect black strings to be unstable only for @xmath11 greater than some critical length @xmath12 .",
    "the vacuum einstein equations , written in adm form @xcite , are 1 ) the hamiltonian constraint @xmath13 2 ) the momentum constraints @xmath14 3 ) the evolution equations for the @xmath15 @xmath16 that follow from the definition of the extrinsic curvature @xmath17 associated with @xmath18 slices , and 4 ) the evolution equations for the extrinsic curvature @xmath19 in the above , @xmath20 are four - dimensional ( spatial ) indices , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are , respectively , the ricci tensor and ricci scalar intrinsic to the four - dimensional spatial hypersurfaces , @xmath23 is the lapse function , @xmath24 is the shift vector , the vertical bar @xmath25 denotes covariant differentiation in the spatial hypersurfaces ( compatible with @xmath15 ) , and @xmath26 .",
    "we note that the term proportional to @xmath27 in  ( [ kdot ] ) has been added as a result of stability considerations ; see for instance , the discussions in  @xcite . to simplify the final set of equations solved numerically , as well as to regularize certain terms that otherwise diverge at spatial infinity ( see the discussion of our coordinate system in the next sub - section ) , we define the following variables @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 and use them as the fundamental dynamical quantities in our numerical code . as discussed in the following sub - sections , to complete the prescription of the evolution problem we need to choose a suitable lapse and shift , specify initial and boundary conditions , and then implement these choices and specifications consistently .",
    "a particular concern here is that `` standard '' outer boundary conditions  @xcite , often imposed during numerical evolution of einstein s equations , might not be well suited for studying the string instability . in particular",
    ", we must be able to evolve for very long times while absolutely minimizing spurious influences from the outer boundary of the computational domain .",
    "in addition , in the present case we can not assume , _ a priori _ , that any given initial configuration will settle down to some stationary solution ; thus , boundary conditions predicated on such assumptions ( such as a @xmath32 fall - off condition in a metric component ) , when imposed at a finite proper distance from the black string , could very well adversely affect the numerical results  .",
    "to ensure minimal boundary influence we therefore extend the domain of integration to @xmath33 by radially compactifying the spacelike hypersurfaces via the introduction of a new coordinate , @xmath34 , defined by @xmath35 as might be expected , this transformation causes computational problems of its own  most notably decreased spatial resolution at large distances  but , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ numerics ] , we can deal with these difficulties using numerical dissipation .",
    "having introduced the new compactifying coordinate , we can directly impose boundary conditions derived from the demand of asymptotic flatness at spatial infinity , which lies at @xmath36 .",
    "we employ singularity excision techniques  @xcite to allow us to evolve the entire perturbed black string spacetime exterior to the apparent horizon ( plus a certain `` buffer zone '' that lies within the horizon ) .",
    "hence , we do not need to impose inner boundary conditions as long as the @xmath37 hypersurfaces penetrate the horizon , and that all characteristics of the evolution equations are in - going on the boundary . ensuring that this is the case involves choosing `` good",
    "'' coordinate conditions ( choice of lapse and shift ) , which , for generic string evolutions , remains an open problem .",
    "as a preliminary step , we have based our coordinate choices on those that yield the ingoing eddington - finkelstein form of the unperturbed black string metric @xmath38 comparison with the general 5-dimensional adm form provides the identifications @xmath39 for reference we also list the two non - trivial components of the extrinsic curvature of a @xmath18 slice defined by ( [ bs_metric ] ) : @xmath40 in generalizing  ( [ bs_lapse ] ) and ( [ bs_shift ] ) to the dynamical case , we have chosen @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "in a preliminary version of our code , we also required that @xmath43 .",
    "this , however , caused a coordinate pathology to develop at late times during the evolution of unstable strings  specifically , some regions of the horizons approached a zero coordinate - radius , while maintaining _ finite _ proper radius . in our current efforts , we choose @xmath44 such that @xmath45 remains constant during evolution @xcite , by requiring that @xmath46 this shift condition performs reasonably well , as will be seen in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "however , our current simulations still suffer from `` grid - stretching '' problems in the @xmath8 direction at late times , suggesting that a more dynamical gauge condition for @xmath47 ( and possibly for @xmath23 and @xmath44 ) could be useful .",
    "this issue is discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "as anticipated , we observe that even numerical truncation errors , if non - uniform in the @xmath8 direction , are enough to trigger the gregory - laflamme instability in our simulations . however , to reduce the computational effort required to reach the `` interesting '' ( i.e. non - perturbative ) stages of evolution , we adopt initial configurations whose departure from the black string solution can be arbitrarily tuned . in order to find such data",
    ", we must solve the hamiltonian constraint , and the @xmath7 and @xmath8 components of the momentum constraint ( the other components of the momentum constraint are trivially satisfied because our coordinate system is adapted to spherical symmetry ) . the deviation ",
    "not necessarily small  from the black string solution , is introduced via @xmath45 , and takes the following form : @xmath48 here , @xmath49 is used to control the overall strength of the `` perturbation '' , while @xmath50 is an integer that controls the spatial frequency in the @xmath8 direction . for the results presented below , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and we perturb about a unit mass ( @xmath55 ) black string solution . as described in more detail in appendix [ app : initialdata ] , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58",
    "are then calculated by solving the constraint equations , with the remainder of the metric and extrinsic curvature variables set to the values they would take for an unperturbed black string ( see ( [ bs_metric ] ) and ( [ bs_k ] ) ) .      to numerically evolve the initial data sets described above , we discretize the evolution equations  ( [ gdot])-([kdot ] ) using second - order accurate finite difference techniques that include crank - nicholson treatment of the temporal and spatial derivatives .",
    "we use a uniform distribution of grid points in @xmath8 and @xmath34 ( recall that @xmath59 ) .",
    "the resulting implicit system of algebraic equations is solved iteratively .",
    "we initially implemented a serial version of the algorithm , and later coded a parallel version using the cactus computational toolkit  @xcite , wherein the equations of motion , monitoring tools and i / o were handled by our own routines , suitably interfaced to cactus .",
    "black hole excision is handled as follows .",
    "we periodically find the apparent horizon , as discussed in the following sub - section and appendix [ app : ah ] .",
    "we then define the surface along which we excise to be a certain number of `` buffer '' points _ inside _ the apparent horizon ( typically @xmath60@xmath61 buffer points are used )   value of the apparent horizon and compared the results with those obtained when the excision region was defined by the apparent horizon .",
    "the agreement obtained gives extra indication that the excision implementation is consistent . ] . during each crank - nicholson iteration ,",
    "all the evolution difference equations are applied up to the excision surface , and any function values referenced by finite difference stencils interior to this surface are defined via fourth order extrapolation . when the apparent horizon location , and hence excision surface changes during evolution , function values at all repopulated points ( i.e. those that moved from inside to outside the excision surface during the time step ) are computed via the same fourth order extrapolation routine .",
    "the one exception to this procedure is for the grid values of @xmath62 , which we specify _ a priori _ on the entire computational domain , and that remain fixed due to our gauge choice ( [ br_gauge ] ) .",
    "moreover , we have found it useful to choose a functional form for @xmath62 that tends to zero at some positive value of @xmath7 ( though inside the original apparent horizon location and outside of the limits of integration of the initial data ) .",
    "this causes the `` pinching - off '' of the unstable black string to be less severe in coordinate space , i.e. we approach zero areal radius at a finite coordinate @xmath7 . in turn , this slightly reduces the virulence of the coordinate problems we observe at late times , and also provides better load - balancing of the parallel code , given the method cactus uses to distribute grids among processors .    for the evolution",
    ", we choose a time step @xmath63 , where the constant @xmath64 must be set less than @xmath65 in order to satisfy the courant - friedrichs - lewy ( cfl ) stability condition that results from our iterative solution of the crank - nicholson scheme ( typically we use @xmath66 ) .",
    "note that this restriction on @xmath64 is based upon flat - space light speeds within our coordinate system ( ( [ bs_metric ] ) with @xmath67 ) , which , for the solutions presented here , are always greater than or equal to the actual coordinate light speeds .",
    "the function @xmath68 is calculated by only considering mesh spacings within the non - excised portion of the coordinate domain .",
    "thus , as the excision surface moves , @xmath69 changes with time since our grid is uniform in @xmath34 , and hence non - uniform in @xmath7 .",
    "crucially , we add kreiss - oliger - style @xcite numerical dissipation to the evolution equations to control unphysical high - frequency solution components ( `` noise '' ) that would otherwise arise during the simulations .",
    "this is particularly helpful at the excision surface , and near @xmath70 , where the radial compactification of points causes all outgoing wave - like components of variables to eventually become poorly resolved .",
    "smoothing of the high frequency components via the kreiss - oliger dissipation  which only targets wavelengths of size on the order of the mesh spacing  prevents them from inducing numerical instabilities near the outer boundary .      to elucidate the nature of our computed spacetimes",
    ", we monitor the following quantities : 1 ) the location of the apparent horizon ( which is also used for excision as explained earlier ) , 2 ) the trajectories of null geodesics that , to a certain extent , should trace the event horizon , and 3 ) the kretschmann invariant @xmath71 ( the square of the riemann tensor ) : @xmath72    if cosmic censorship holds  and results from our current simulations provide no evidence to the contrary  then any apparent horizon found will always be inside an event horizon . as is well known , although the apparent horizon can often be used as a reasonable approximation to the event horizon , the two do _ not _ , in general , coincide  . clearly , the event horizon is the quantity of interest in studying the gregory - laflamme instability , and therefore we would like to locate it , or at least a reasonably good approximation to it , in our simulation results .",
    "such an approximation can be obtained by looking for the boundary of the causal past of some @xmath73 surface that is sufficiently far outside the apparent horizon that it is certain not to be inside the event horizon , yet close enough to the apparent horizon that its causal past , tracing backwards from the end - time of the simulation , probes the region of interest of the spacetime .",
    "we use a method to find the approximate event horizon discussed by libson et al .",
    "the approach is based on radial outgoing null geodesics ; as explained in @xcite , the stable direction for the integration of null rays that emanate from the vicinity of an event horizon is backwards in time @xmath6 .",
    "thus , once we have the complete data from the entire evolution , we start with data from the latest time step available , and trace the null rays backwards in time .",
    "monitoring curvature scalars is useful in obtaining coordinate independent information about a numerical solution of the einstein equations .",
    "in particular , @xmath71 , as defined by  ( [ i ] ) evaluates to @xmath74 for the unperturbed black string solution , and as @xmath75 is an invariant in spherical symmetry ( i.e. it is proportional to the area of an @xmath73 2-sphere ) , we can compare @xmath76 to the values of @xmath71 computed from a numerical solution to get some indication of how close the computed solution is to a black string spacetime .",
    "furthermore , we can examine @xmath71 to see whether curvature singularities ( other than the central @xmath77 singularity ) may be forming prior to the demise of the simulation that invariably occurs when sufficiently steep metric gradients develop .",
    "we note , however , that if @xmath71 does _ not _ diverge , it does not necessarily follow that the geometry is remaining non - singular ; we would need to examine a larger set of curvature scalars to be certain that the solutions are remaining free of physical singularities .",
    "appendix [ app : ah ] contains an explanation of the method we used to find apparent horizons , while details of the integration techniques aimed at approximately locating event horizons can be found in appendix [ app : null ] .",
    "in this section we present results from our preliminary study of the black string instability .",
    "after briefly showing that we recover some of the key gregory - laflamme results in the next sub - section , we present a detailed analysis of a typical unstable case in sec . [",
    "sec : unstable ] . in the following",
    ", we will use the value of @xmath78 ( with @xmath55 ) found by gubser @xcite , which is more accurate than the value we can estimate from the zero - crossing of the ( positive mode ) interpolating curve presented in  @xcite .",
    "we ran a variety of simulations of black strings that were perturbed according to the prescription discussed in section [ i d ] .",
    "we concentrated on cases with @xmath11 ranging from @xmath79 to @xmath80 and defined @xmath62 via equation ( [ gtt ] ) .",
    "in general , we observed the expected instability for @xmath81 , though for the maximum resolution at which we performed this survey ( @xmath82 grid points in @xmath7 and @xmath83 points in @xmath8 ) , we could only confirm @xmath12 to within about @xmath84 of the expected value . in",
    "this regard we note that as @xmath11 approaches @xmath12 from above , the growth rate of the instability goes to @xmath85 , requiring longer time integrations to identify the instability , which , in turn , demands ever increasing resolution to counter the effects of accumulating numerical errors .",
    "furthermore , the initial configurations we have adopted contain energy in the form of gravitational waves , and some of this energy falls into the string early on during the evolution .",
    "the increase in the mass of the string ( based upon the increase in area of the apparent horizon ) is typically around @xmath86 , and we would have to take this into account were we to attempt to determine @xmath12 from our simulations to a higher degree of accuracy .    as a demonstration of the ability of our code to `` bracket '' the instability , and following the notation of  @xcite , fig .",

    "nevertheless , the dynamical behavior observed is sufficiently robust for some comments to be made .",
    "for instance , the results are not inconsistent with gregory and laflamme s conjecture that the solution bifurcates into a sequence of black holes  indeed , we can suggest at least two mechanisms by which this could occur :    1 .   via a thinning neck that eventually vanishes , if the trend seen in the simulation continues . note that this would require a ) that the proper length of the string continue to grow , in order not to violate area theorems , and b ) that the thin string be non - uniform , for otherwise _ it _ would be subject to a further gregory - laflamme - like instability .",
    "2 .   via a sequence of gregory - laflamme instabilities , if the thin neck stays `` close '' to a uniform black string , since the neck s length is beyond the critical one for a string with an effective mass computed from the radius of the apparent horizon . in this case , one could envision a `` cascade '' of instabilities leading to the bifurcation .",
    "we note that either scenario would not necessarily be inconsistent with horowitz and maeda s results , should the vanishing of the neck take infinite affine time as measured by local null generators of the horizon . at the same time , a continuation of the observed trend would argue against achieving a stationary solution with a mild dependence on the string dimension ( i.e. a small value of @xmath87 ) , as found in perturbative calculations @xcite . for then , the rather extreme thinning / bulging that we see must be transient behavior that is `` further '' from the end - state than the perturbed black string was .",
    "a more complete exposition of the nature of unstable black string evolution would appear to require coordinate conditions able to adapt to solution features that develop at late times  that is , in a manner that does not introduce severe metric gradients that are not correlated with large gradients in physical quantities .",
    "for example , it may help to replace the fixed - lapse slicing with maximal slicing , which enforces that the divergence of the local , spatial volume element be zero .",
    "another , perhaps even more crucial option , would be to introduce a @xmath8 component to the shift vector that keeps @xmath120 close to ( or exactly ) unity throughout the evolution .",
    "these options are currently under investigation .",
    "additionally , it would be interesting to explore a wider range of initial conditions describing `` perturbed '' black strings than that considered here .",
    "for example , the imposed @xmath8-periodicity implies that the equivalent , uncompactified space time consists of identical spherical - black - hole / black - string segments at late ( intermediate ) times",
    ". it would be instructive to see what happens should we break this symmetry , by making @xmath134 , and then introducing some higher - wavelength perturbation similar to @xmath135 in ( [ gtt ] ) , but with more asymmetry in the initial data ( note that this would be more computationally demanding ) .",
    "finally , it would be very interesting to study the evolution of the solutions recently found by wiseman  @xcite , and mentioned in the introduction .",
    "these configurations actually correspond to stationary solutions , and their perturbative stability , or otherwise , is currently not known .",
    "since wiseman shows that his solutions can not be the end - states conjectured by horowitz and maeda , it is important to understand their behavior , since if they are stable they may well represent physically meaningful states , while if unstable , they may be difficult to attain via dynamical evolution .",
    "an interesting observation from our simulations , to the length so far achieved , is that they do not display a conical `` waist '' like those presented in  @xcite and further analyzed in  @xcite .",

    "we solve the set of coupled constraint equations ( [ hc])-([mc ] ) via an iterative procedure , where at each sub - step of the iteration we solve a single equation for one of @xmath56 , @xmath136 or @xmath57 , assuming that the values of the other variables are known .",
    "we iterate this process until the residuals of all the equations are simultaneously below a certain tolerance ",
    "a typical value is @xmath137 .",
    "the overall iteration is initialized using values corresponding to an unperturbed black string solution .",
    "we now provide a few more details concerning the solution of each of the constraint equations .",
    "the equations are discretized on a uniform grid of points ( @xmath138 ) with @xmath139 , and @xmath140 ( recall that , from  ( [ defx ] ) , the radial coordinate , @xmath7 , is related to @xmath34 by @xmath141 ) .",
    "we first consider the hamiltonian constraint ( [ hc ] ) which , in the coordinate system we have adopted , has the following form : @xmath142 here , the @xmath143 , are functions that generally depend on all the metric coefficient and their derivatives _ except _",
    "@xmath56 ( and its derivatives ) .",

    "we now direct attention to the @xmath7 momentum constraint , which , viewed as an equation for @xmath58 , has the form : @xmath150 where the @xmath151 do not depend on @xmath58 or its derivatives .",
    "we note that there is complete decoupling in the @xmath8-direction in this case ; in effect , we have to solve an ode along each @xmath152 line .",

    "finally , the @xmath8 component of the momentum constraint , which fixes @xmath57 , has the form : @xmath155 where the @xmath156 are independent of @xmath57 and its derivatives .",
    "this equation is solved analogously to the @xmath7 momentum constraint , but now using a discretization that is centered at points ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "`` boundary values '' , @xmath158_{i,1 } , \\ , i = 1,\\ldots n_x$ ] , are specified along the line @xmath159 , again using corresponding values from the black string solution , and the integration proceeds for @xmath160 .",
    "we use a _ flow _ , or _",
    "level - set _ method to search for apparent horizons within @xmath18 spatial slices of the spacetime .",
    "we restrict our search to simply connected apparent horizons that are periodic in z. such an apparent horizon can be described by a curve in the @xmath161 plane , which we define to be the level surface @xmath162 of the function @xmath163 in other words , the apparent horizon will be given by the curve @xmath164 .",
    "the apparent horizon is the outermost , marginally trapped surface ; hence , we want to find an equation for @xmath165 such that the outward null expansion , normal to the corresponding surface @xmath162 , is zero .",
    "to this end , we first construct the unit spatial vector @xmath166 , normal to @xmath167 : @xmath168 then , using @xmath166 and the @xmath18 hypersurface normal vector @xmath169 , we can construct future - pointing outgoing(@xmath170 ) and ingoing(@xmath171 ) null vectors @xmath172 the normalization of the null vectors is ( arbitrarily ) @xmath173 .",
    "the outward null expansion @xmath174 is then the divergence of @xmath175 projected onto an @xmath167 surface : @xmath176 substituting expressions ( [ fs2 ] ) and ( [ sadef ] ) into equation ( [ exp1 ] ) , with @xmath177 , provides us with an ordinary differential equation for @xmath165 .",
    "initially we solved equation ( [ exp1 ] ) via a `` shooting '' method  given a guess for @xmath178 , and assuming that @xmath179 ( where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath8 ) , we integrate the equation to @xmath180 , and repeat the process until we find a solution where @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "an efficient sequence of guesses can be generated using a bisection search , as the qualitative behavior of the solution is different depending upon whether the initial guess for @xmath178 is inside or outside the apparent horizon .",
    "since the shooting method is difficult to extend to a parallel implementation in an efficient way , we opted to use the following point - wise relaxation method ( or flow method ) to determine @xmath165 .",
    "we supply an initial guess , @xmath183 , for the entire function @xmath165 , and then iterate the following equation until the norm of the expansion @xmath184 of @xmath185 is below some desired threshold ( in our runs we have typically set it to @xmath186 , where @xmath101 is the basic scale of discretization ) : @xmath187 here , @xmath188 is the solution after the @xmath189 iteration .",
    "equation  ( [ flow_eqn ] ) can be viewed as an _ explicit _ discretization of a parabolic evolution equation for @xmath190 , where @xmath191 is `` time '' and @xmath192 is the time - step for the evolution ( the parabolic nature of the equation is evident when @xmath174 is expanded in terms of @xmath165 via ( [ exp1])for brevity we do not give the explicit form of the equation here ) .",
    "thus , for stability @xmath192 must be chosen to be less than @xmath193 .",
    "given a `` reasonable '' initial guess @xmath183 , one can see how iteration of equation ( [ flow_eqn ] ) will cause @xmath194 to `` flow '' to the apparent horizon : if @xmath194 is outside of the apparent horizon , then typically the expansion @xmath184 will be positive there , causing @xmath195 to decrease towards the apparent horizon , and vice - versa if @xmath194 is inside the apparent horizon .",
    "we use @xmath196 as the initial guess at @xmath197 ; after @xmath197 we search for the apparent horizon every @xmath198 time steps ( where @xmath198 is typically in the range @xmath199 ) , and use the shape found at the previous search as the initial guess for the next search . usually , on the order of tens to thousands of iterations of ( [ flow_eqn ] )",
    "are required to solve for @xmath165 to within a level of accuracy such that the approximate solution is roughly within a mesh spacing of the exact solution ( as estimated in a few specific calculations by solving ( [ flow_eqn ] ) close to machine precision ) .",
    "a single iteration of ( [ flow_eqn ] ) can be computed very rapidly relative to the time taken to compute a metric - evolution step ; however in a parallel environment , if thousands of iterations are needed on a regular basis ( which _ is _ so at late times during the evolution of an unstable black string ) , the apparent horizon finder becomes a slight speed bottleneck in the code , due to the time it takes to communicate the results of each iteration amongst the processors involved .",
    "here we describe one method we use , following  @xcite , to locate approximations to event horizons .",
    "this method involves locating the boundary of the causal past of some @xmath73 surface of the spacetime by following radial null geodesics .",
    "we write the geodesic equation in lagrangian form : @xmath200 where @xmath87 is the affine parameter along the geodesic , and a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath87 . since we are interested in null trajectories , we set @xmath201 . for radial , ingoing geodesics , we have @xmath202 , and thus the geodesic equations reduce to the set : @xmath203 where the dot denotes a derivative with respect to coordinate time , and @xmath204 . then , starting at a certain value of @xmath205 , and for each grid point along the @xmath8 direction , equations ( [ eq : geod ] ) are integrated backwards in time using a second order runge - kutta scheme .    following null geodesics along @xmath152 lines does not guarantee that we are tracing the causal past of @xmath205 , though for the spacetimes studied here , and the coordinate system used , this should offer a good approximation . furthermore , although radial geodesics might not be the best choice , since the event horizon is an attractor , they will trace it accurately .
