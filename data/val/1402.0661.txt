    "the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; @xcite ) was built to survey the sky simultaneously in four bands with central wavelengths of 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22 @xmath3 m ( hereafter referred to as w1 , w2 , w3 , and w4 , respectively ) .",
    "the four - band cryogenic mission covered the sky 1.2 times between the dates 2010 jan 07 and 2010 aug 06 .",
    "after the solid hydrogen cryogen was depleted in the outer tank , data covering 30% of the sky continued to be acquired in the three - band ( w1 , w2 , and w3 ) cryogenic mission until 2010 sep 29 , when cryogen in the inner tank was exhausted .",
    "wise surveyed 70% of the sky in the two - band ( w1 and w2 ) post - cryogenic neowise mission ( @xcite ) until the satellite was placed into hibernation on 2011 feb 01 . in total , wise surveyed the full sky twice in at least two bands and 20% of the sky a third time , with each coverage epoch separated by approximately six months .",
    "data were processed and released separately for the cryogenic and post - cryogenic missions .",
    "the aim of the allwise program was to combine all of the data from the wise mission to leverage the full depth and time history of the w1 and w2 data .",
    "specifically , one of these goals was to use the full wise data to perform the first all - sky proper motion survey at these wavelengths .",
    "in addition to the exciting prospects created by doing a kinematic survey in a new wavelength regime , allwise processing  because of the short , six - month time baseline between epochs  enables us to search for very high motion objects that may have been overlooked by the longer time baselines of earlier all - sky motion surveys . in these surveys ,",
    "an object could be `` lost '' between consecutive views . a case in point",
    "is the first motion discovery from allwise , the usdm3 star wisea j070720.50 + 170532.7 ( @xcite ) , which is moving at @xmath4 yr@xmath5 and was missed by all previous motion surveys despite being in the more heavily studied northern hemisphere , being easily detected at optical wavelengths , and falling in an uncomplicated region free of source confusion .    in this paper , we describe how motions are measured in allwise ( section 2 ) , characterize the resulting motions and present caveats to users of the allwise data products ( section 3 ) , present a catalog of new motion discoveries ( section 4 ) , compare that to the recent list of wise motion discoveries published by @xcite ( section 5 ) , discuss our spectroscopic follow - up of some of the discoveries ( section 6 ) , and highlight a couple of specific science cases  the hunt for rare , l - type subdwarfs ( section 7 ) and the search for missing members of the immediate solar neighborhood ( section 8)  that we have already explored using the discovery list . in section 9",
    "we provide a summary of our allwise results thus far .",
    "allwise combines all previous wise single - exposure images ( called level 1b frames ) that satisfy a minimum quality standard .",
    "these individual frames are match - filtered and co - added on pre - defined @xmath6 atlas tile footprints on the sky .",
    "pixel outlier rejection is used to suppress transient features and objects of extremely high motion ( e.g. , asteroids and satellite streaks ) .    in processing of the earlier wise data sets ,",
    "the following procedure was used for source detection and astrometric / photometric measurement .",
    "a list of detections from a multiband signal - to - noise ratio map of the coadded images was first generated for each atlas tile .",
    "at the position of each detection in the list , a point response function ( psf ) fit was then performed to measure the source position and flux via a @xmath7 minimization procedure on the stack of individual frames that generated the coadd . because the wise beam size is large ( the full - width at half - maximum , fwhm , is 12@xmath8 at w4 )",
    ", the deblending of overlapping detections  and the further deconvolution of those detections into possible multiple components  is handled through a @xmath7 minimization procedure explained in more detail in the wise all - sky release explanatory supplement .    during allwise processing ,",
    "the source position measurement model was augmented with linear motion terms in ra and dec ( the `` motion fit '' ) . in allwise processing , the fit excluding these new motion terms ( the `` stationary fit '' ) is performed first , and the full set of photometric parameters is computed .",
    "the motion fit begins with the stationary position as the initial position estimate at a fiducial time that is the flux - weighted mean observational epoch of each source . because of the effects of noise on the non - linear @xmath7 minimization algorithm , it is sensitive to the initial estimates used to start the minimization search . of the several ways to weigh the epoch averaging , flux weighting based on the stationary - fit single - frame flux solutions",
    "was found to be the most effective in reproducing motions of known moving objects .",
    "readers are encouraged to consult the allwise release explanatory supplement for additional details .    as a result of this addition to the allwise processing",
    ", motions are now measured for all coadd - detected wise sources , giving researchers a powerful new tool with which to study and/or identify nearby stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "this paper characterizes these new motion measurements , discusses the caveats , and showcases two research areas  the search for low - metallicity stars and brown dwarfs and the hunt for missing members of the solar neighborhood  that are particularly well suited for this data set .",
    "the allwise time baseline is typically between six months and a year for any point on the sky . except for ecliptic polar regions ,",
    "the time sampling will be confined to discrete epochs separated by roughly six months .",
    "multiple measurements , spanning the range of a few days , are taken at each epoch .",
    "most of the sky has two epochs covering six months , and @xmath220% of the sky has three epochs spanning a time range of one year .",
    "it is important to understand what this time sampling means for motion measurements . in general , it is the closest objects to the sun that exhibit the largest proper motions . being close , these objects will also exhibit substantial parallax . because data are taken near @xmath9 solar elongation , wise observed these objects at their maximum parallax factors .",
    "as an example , an object seen at two wise epochs will have motion that is a combination of half its yearly proper motion ( because the two epochs are only separated by six months ) and twice its parallax ( because the vantage point between epochs has shifted by 2 au ) .",
    "having only two epochs , allwise can not disentangle the effects of parallax and proper motion and thus measures only _ apparent motion _ on the sky as opposed to _",
    "proper motion_.    figure  [ individual_epoch_positions ] ( top panel ) shows the individual level 1b frame measurements of the position of the nearby l+t dwarf binary wise j104915.57 - 531906.1 .",
    "this source has three epochs of coverage in allwise .",
    "the motion is not linear because this binary s parallax ( @xmath10 ) and proper motion ( @xmath11 yr@xmath5 ) are comparable in size ( @xcite ) .",
    "it would be possible to measure the proper motion by using only the epoch-1 and epoch-3 points , since these clusters of points were taken at the same parallax factor ; however , allwise uses data from all three epochs and thus will measure a motion that is not the actual `` proper '' motion .",
    "the extreme m subdwarf lhs 161 in figure  [ individual_epoch_positions ] ( bottom panel ) demonstrates a case at the opposite extreme , where the parallax is swamped by a much larger proper motion ( @xmath12 = 0@xmath13025 and @xmath14 yr@xmath5 ; @xcite ) .",
    "as expected for this case , the three separate epochs of data more closely follow a linear progression in time .    ]    this can be further demonstrated with a couple of examples drawn from areas with two - epoch coverage , which represents the majority of wise data .",
    "figure  [ lhs239_predicted_track ] shows the predicted path of the white dwarf lhs 239 on the sky , and figure  [ gl570d_predicted_track ] shows the path for the t dwarf gliese 570 d. in each of these plots , the grey track shows the predicted path of the object from the date of the first wise epoch to a date one year later .",
    "the date of the second ( i.e. , final ) wise epoch , approximately six months after the first , is also noted .",
    "the motion that allwise measures is the positional difference between the start of the track and the point six months later , whereas the true proper motion would be that measured between the start of the track and the point twelve months later .",
    "the true proper motion and parallax , the predicted motion from allwise , and the actual allwise values are given in the legend of both figures . note that the actual allwise measurements are , within their errors , identical to the predicted values , although not necessarily close to the true proper motion measures .",
    "as stated earlier , these allwise measurements should be regarded as _",
    "apparent motion _ values ( parallax + proper motion ) and not as pure _ proper motion _ values .    ]    ]    figure  [ gl554_predicted_track ] illustrates the predicted sky path for the k dwarf gliese 554 , located in an area with three epochs of coverage . in this case , the wise data fall almost perfectly along the proper motion vector . it would be expected that the allwise motion measure would be very close to the true proper motion value , which is indeed the case .",
    "it should be noted that a measurement using only epoch 1 + 2 data would have a larger motion than a measurement using only epoch 2 + 3 data , although both would have the correct position angle .    ]",
    "because the allwise - measured motions do not decouple proper motion and parallax , these motions can not be used to predict source positions at other epochs .",
    "rather , their utility is in identifying potentially interesting , nearby objects for further follow - up .",
    "allwise is able to identify objects with very high motion .",
    "table  [ highest_motion_stars ] lists the eleven highest proper motion systems known ( @xmath15 yr@xmath5 ) and compares their published proper motions to the motions derived by allwise .",
    "most of these sources are extremely bright and heavily saturated on the wise detectors . agreement between published values and those in allwise",
    "is not expected due both to saturation effects and parallax .",
    "nonetheless , the comparison shows that the highest motion stars can be identified as such in allwise data .",

    "there are sources in the combination of the allwise source catalog and reject table that have single - axis motions as large as 670@xmath8 yr@xmath5 ( 670,000 mas yr@xmath5 ) ; spot checks of these sources show them to be artifacts associated with extended structures like diffraction spikes and optical ghosts .",

    "as shown in figure  [ truth_vs_parallax ] , which illustrates the motion differences in ra and dec plotted as a function of parallax , the ra differences have a striking dependence on parallax ( i.e. , objects with the largest differences tend to have the largest parallax values ) while the dec differences show only a modest increase at the largest parallaxes . because the ecliptic and equatorial systems are tilted with respect to each other by only @xmath223 degrees , parallactic motion , which is primarily manifested in ecliptic longitude , affects equatorial longitude ( ra ) more severely than equatorial latitude ( dec ) .",

    "astrometric precision is degraded at brighter magnitudes ( w2 @xmath19 7 mag ) because such objects have saturated image cores , and it quickly degrades at fainter magnitudes ( w2 @xmath24 12 mag ) due to poorer photon counting statistics .",

    "a spurious or pure - noise solution that has not converged after the maximum number of steps will lead to a motion at the `` pile - up '' value of 6875 mas yr@xmath5 .",
    "as part of allwise pipeline processing at ipac , the quality assurance code filtered the list of detections from each atlas tile to identify objects believed to be moving significantly .",
    "these criteria were used to select only the choicest motion objects from the source lists and to keep the number of candidates manageable on the tight schedule allotted for allwise quality assurance checks .",
    "the criteria used are as follows :    \\(1 ) to ensure that the object is not flagged as an artifact , the @xmath38 parameter was required not to have a capital - letter value at any position in its four - character code , in which the four characters refer to the four wise bands .",
    "capital letters are used when the software has determined in that band that the object was a spurious detection of either a diffraction ( ` d ' ) spike , a scattered light halo ( ` h ' ) surrounding a bright star , an optical ( ` o ' ) ghost image , or persistence ( ` p ' ) ",
    "i.e. , a short - term latent image  left behind by a bright source on the detector . values of @xmath38 having only lower - case versions of these same letters ( indicating that the object is likely real and only contaminated by an artifact ) or zero ( indicating that the source is unaffected by known artifacts ) were allowed .",
    "\\(2 ) to ensure that the object is point - like , a value of @xmath66 ( no blends ) was required .",
    "also , the motion - fit , reduced @xmath7 values in all bands , @xmath67 , were required to be less than two to eliminate sources that are obviously extended .",
    "\\(3 ) to eliminate more poorly measured sources from consideration , the signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath68 , was required to be greater than seven in at least one band .",
    "\\(4 ) to ensure that the code selected only those objects with robust and statistically significant motions , the following criteria were applied : ( a ) the ratio of the reduced @xmath7 value between the stationary and motion fit , @xmath69 , was required to be greater than 1.03 .",
    "this ensures that the motion - fit solution significantly improves the overall reduced @xmath7 value compared to the stationary fit .",
    "( b ) as explained in section  [ motions_real_false ] above , the @xmath37 criterion was required to be greater than 27.63 to select only those objects with statistically significant motions .",
    "( c ) the second and third characters of @xmath70 were required to be ` n ' and ` 0 ' , respectively .",
    "a value of ` n ' means that no blend - swapping has occurred and a value of ` 0 ' means that the offset between the stationary - fit and the motion - fit position at the mean epoch is less than one arcsecond .",
    "these values were chosen because blended sources often have blend swapping , and spurious sources often have unphysically large positional differences at the mean epoch between the non - motion and motion solutions .",
    "\\(5 ) to ensure that the motion measurement has a solid foundation of w1- and w2-band data underlying it , we experimented with various values of @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "the first two parameters specify the number of frames in w1 and w2 , and the third parameter specifies the time difference between the earliest and latest frames in w1 . in the end , these parameters were all set to be greater than zero because regions of very sparse coverage were found not to contribute a large number of spurious motion sources , mainly because the vast majority of the sky is well covered across two or more epochs .",
    "these criteria were written to eliminate blended / extended sources , spurious objects , and pure noise .",
    "other contaminants listed in section  [ false_sources ]  the ssst sources , flux transients , w3- and w4-dominated sources , and cosmic rays and streaked frames in low coverage areas  were discovered as a result of these quality assurance checks .",
    "these contaminants were generally easy to recognize via a visual inspection step , which displayed images of the field in the allwise w1 , w2 , w3 , and w4 coadds along with 2mass images at @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 . for",
    "wise objects that were also visible in 2mass , which represents the vast majority of sources identified , any motion should be obvious in the 10 + years between the 2mass and wise image sets yr@xmath5 ( section  [ smallest_motion_section ] ) , this means that objects will have moved @xmath77 in the 10 + years between the 2mass and wise imaging sets , which is a sufficiently large motion to be obvious by eye . ] .",
    "the quality assurance scientists checked these images for all candidate motion objects and retained only those objects having no 2mass source at the allwise position .",

    "this list was then run ( by jdk ) through simbad using a two - arcminute search radius around the allwise position to search for previously known objects .",

    "when known proper motion sources were found outside of 10@xmath8 , the allwise- and simbad - reported motions were checked to see if the object was a very high - motion source , generally @xmath79 yr@xmath5 .",
    "this further check eliminated many known , small - numbered lhs ( luyten half second ) objects .",
    "the remaining list of objects was then checked ( by jdk ) against the fourth us naval observatory ccd astrograph catalog ( ucac4 ; @xcite ) using a one - arminute search radius . objects with significant ucac4-reported motions were considered to be possible matches to the allwise source .",
    "the match was considered confirmed if the ucac4 source appeared to have a motion of the right magnitude and in the correct direction , as inferred from visual inspection of the motion source across the dss2 , 2mass , and wise images , to be the allwise - selected object .",
    "those objects matching a source with reliable motions in ucac4 were flagged as such but kept in the object list because they have no simbad entries .",
    "after these checks , the list was run again through simbad and further checked against dwarfarchives.org , against a list of published papers ( on low - mass objects ) likely not to have been ingested into simbad by 2013 december , and against catalogs housed by vizier .",
    "these checks ( by gnm and as ) enabled us to eliminate other objects .",
    "objects were kept in the list only when simbad had no reported proper motion information and no links to published papers citing a proper motion value .",
    "thus , a few objects with published spectral types are included in the list because this will be the first refereed publication in simbad giving their motion information .",
    "objects listed only in ucac4 and other catalogs found in vizier are noted as such in the final list .    of the 26,850 motion candidates selected by our quality assurance criteria",

    "the first ( table 3 ) contains 3,525 objects whose motions could be confirmed using non - wise data , and the second ( table 4 ) contains 58 unconfirmed objects lacking counterparts in earlier surveys . for the list of confirmed objects , one of us ( as ) consulted the 2mass images to find the wise source at the 2mass epoch and",
    "then tabulated the 2mass position and magnitudes from the 2mass all - sky point source catalog .",
    "these 2mass associations were then double checked ( by jdk ) by creating finder charts of dss , 2mass and wise images centered at the position of the 2mass source .",
    "using these associations , a proper motion was measured for each source using the 2mass position as the first epoch and the mean wise all - sky source catalog position as the second epoch .    because the identification of motion candidates during quality assurance took place before selection of objects for the allwise source catalog ( and before the ssst phenomenon was fully recognized ) , we had to retroactively replace a small number of our motion candidates that appeared only in the allwise reject table with their more appropriate entry from the allwise source catalog . in some cases , the entry in the allwise source catalog does not have a motion significant enough to have been selected by the quality assurance criteria .",
    "we retain such cases if our independent checks using the 2mass - to - wise time baseline confirm that the objects are truly moving .",
    "an example of this is wisea j000205.60@xmath0322545.9 , which has allwise motions of @xmath80 and @xmath81 mas yr@xmath5 in ra and dec , respectively , but whose comparison with the earlier 2mass position confirms a motion of @xmath82 and @xmath83 mas yr@xmath5 in ra and dec .",

    "the clumpiness of these discoveries in the southern hemisphere ( e.g. , at @xmath85 ra @xmath86 and dec @xmath87 ) is largely a consequence of the wise three - epoch coverage ( middle panel of figure 14 ) overlapping areas poorly covered by the nltt .    ]",

    "figure  [ w1w2_vs_jw2 ] ( which can be compared to figure 9 in @xcite ) breaks the degeneracy between the l and t dwarf populations .",

    "there are two reasons .",
    "first , the apparent magnitudes of the nearest t and y dwarfs are sufficiently faint that allwise would only have been able to measure significant motions for the very fastest movers ( see figure  [ smallest_motions ] ) .",
    "second , several bright , very high motion t and y dwarfs _ were _ picked up by our criteria , but these are not included in table 3 because they were previously known .",
    "in fact , it is hard to imagine a bright , nearby t or y dwarf that would not have been picked up via color selection because , after all , wise was designed to be highly sensitive to the methane absorption that defines these spectral types . with longer time baselines , wise - like data would be able to probe deeper magnitude limits and smaller motions , enabling the discovery of fainter and/or colder objects than color selection itself can provide .",
    "although it is possible that allwise has identified a moving w2-only source with a w1 @xmath0 w2 color limit sufficiently marginal that color - based criteria would not have selected it , our current motion - based criteria did not extract it .",

    "the reduced proper motion can be thought of as a poor man s substitute for an absolute magnitude measurement when a parallax is lacking . in the distance modulus equation ,",
    "the total proper motion is used in place of the parallax ( this is done because , to first order , the higher an object s proper motion , the larger its parallax is likely to be ) and the `` absolute magnitude '' that results is called the reduced proper motion . at @xmath74-band",
    "this would be written as @xmath96 , where @xmath3 is expressed in arcsec yr@xmath5 and the reduced proper motion is in magnitudes .",
    "objects with abnormally high space velocities confound this logic , however  they have high motions not because they are close but because they are old . as a result",
    ", these objects have reduced motion values that are significantly fainter than objects of average kinematics .",
    "see @xcite for a more extensive discussion .",
    "fortunately , this enables such objects ( which tend to be low - metallicity because they are very old ) to be easily selected from the bulk of objects ( of near solar metallicity ) in the galactic disk .",
    "several objects with reduced proper motion at @xmath74-band @xmath24 19 mag and @xmath97 w2 @xmath98 mag can be seen in figure  [ reducedpmj_vs_jw2 ] and are prime low - metallicity candidates .",

    "the locus at lower left near ( 0.3 , 0.3 ) corresponds roughly to late - f or early - g spectral types ( @xcite ) and marks the earliest spectral types for which we have new motions .",
    "the bulk of objects clustered near ( 1.1 , 0.8 ) are mid - m dwarfs , which by far dominate the solar neighborhood ( figure 11 of @xcite ) .",
    "the trail of objects into the upper right corner of the figure is the @xmath230 l and t dwarfs .",
    "this diagram also shows a collection of objects that fall below the standard main sequence .",
    "qualitatively , if we take the long - baseline color , @xmath74 @xmath0 w2 , to be indicative of temperature or spectral type , and the short - baseline color , @xmath100 to sample more specific atmospheric physics , we would expect objects at the same @xmath74 @xmath0 w2 value as a standard main sequence star but with a bluer @xmath101 value to be low - metallicity because of the increased contribution of collision - induced absorption by h@xmath102 at @xmath103 band .",
