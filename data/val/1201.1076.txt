    "the statistical and probabilistic problems considered in this work are motivated by questions arising from data traffic analysis in modern communication networks such as the internet . over these networks",
    ", information is sent in the form of packets , and packets are grouped into flows .",
    "( a flow corresponds to a group of packets sharing common characteristics .",
    "ideally , a flow can be thought of as a set of packets that arises in the network through a remote terminal session or a web page download . )",
    "each packet carries information about the flow it belongs to and also whether it is the first or the last packet in the flow . examining each packet",
    "then allows all flows to be reconstructed . knowing the structure of flows ( flow level characteristics ) helps network operators and networking researchers to understand and discover characteristics of data traffic .",
    "a key difficulty with capturing each packet is that this rapidly leads to a huge amount of data to store and analyze .",
    "for instance , capturing all traffic for a few hours on a gigabit / sec .",
    "link at a  medium load level yields several hundred gigabytes of data . a way to reduce",
    "the volume of data is by sampling packets .",
    "one of the simplest approaches is probabilistic sampling , where each packet , independently of the others , is captured and analyzed with a fixed probability @xmath0 .",
    "the basic problem , known as the _ inversion problem _ in the network traffic literature , is then to deduce the structure of the original flows from sampled packets .",
    "this problem has recently attracted much attention in the networking community , with the focus almost exclusively on inference of the original distribution of flow sizes ( total number of packets ) ; see @xcite . in this work , we take a closer look at statistical properties of the previously considered estimator of the original distribution of flow sizes and are also interested in inference of interarrival times between packets from sampled data . this distribution allows traffic burstiness to be characterized and leads to other major characteristics such as the duration of a flow .      from a mathematical standpoint ,",
    "flows and their probabilistic sampling can be described as follows .",
    "as suggested by data traffic measurements ( e.g. , @xcite ) , a flow can be modeled as a finite renewal process , where the total number of renewals @xmath1 is random and the interrenewal times @xmath2 , @xmath3 , are positive i.i.d .",
    "random variables , independent of @xmath1 .",
    "suppose that the finite renewal process is sampled probabilistically with a fixed probability @xmath0 to obtain a sampled finite point process .",
    "( as shown below , the resulting sampled point process is generally not a finite renewal process . )",
    "the sampled number of renewals ( which could be zero ) and sampled interrenewal times ( which are available only when the number of sampled renewals is greater than @xmath4 ) will be denoted by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "we illustrate this notation in figure [ frp - ssp ] , where all circles ( both empty and full ) correspond to the finite renewal process , and full circles correspond to the sampled finite point process .",
    "given @xmath8 i.i.d .",
    "copies of a sampled finite point process ( some of which are empty when the number of sampled renewals is zero ) , one of our main goals is to infer the original distribution @xmath9 of interrenewal times @xmath2 .",
    "the focus is on nonparametric inference of @xmath9 , statistical properties of the resulting estimator and its performance in simulations .",
    "the estimator of @xmath9 involves a  nonparametric estimator of the original distribution @xmath10 of the total number of renewals @xmath1 , which has previously been considered in the network traffic context @xcite .",
    "statistical properties of the estimator of @xmath10 will also be studied here for the first time .      to be able to make inference about @xmath9",
    ", we first need to relate it to @xmath11 , where the latter indicates the conditional distribution function of @xmath6 given @xmath12 ( with @xmath13 ) . as part of this work ( see theorem [ t : lt_sit ] in section [ s : renewal - to - sampled ] ) , we show that @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the @xmath16th convolution . in particular , the right - hand side of ( [ e : dq - d - wknown ] ) , and hence @xmath11 , does not depend @xmath17 .",
    "we also note for later reference that the definition of the sequence @xmath18 involves the distribution @xmath10 . somewhat independently of the main objectives above , we examine ( [ e : dq - d - wknown ] ) for several underlying distributions @xmath10 , such as geometric and heavy - tailed , that arise in network traffic studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , in the geometric case , the distribution @xmath11 does not depend on @xmath19 , although this seems to be an exception to the general rule .",
    "we also provide a result similar to ( [ e : dq - d - wknown ] ) for a multidimensional vector @xmath20 .",
    "this allows ( conditional ) dependencies to be examined among sampled interrenewal times .",
    "for example , when the distribution @xmath10 is geometric , the sampled interrenewal times turn out to be independent , in which case the sampled finite point process is a finite renewal process .",
    "we should also note that forms of conditioning other than on @xmath12 are possible , such as @xmath21 ; these will be discussed briefly .",
    "having the relation ( [ e : dq - d - wknown ] ) , we would naturally expect that it can be inverted , in the sense that @xmath22 where @xmath23 is obtained by reversion of @xmath24 , that is , their respective @xmath25-transformations ( or formal power series ) @xmath26 and @xmath27 satisfy @xmath28 .",
    "the relation ( [ e : d - dq - wknown ] ) suggests a natural estimator of @xmath9 , defined as ( see section [ s : times - sampled - to - renewals ] ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the empirical distribution function of @xmath6 given @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the reversion of the sequence @xmath33 , where the latter is defined as @xmath34 by replacing @xmath10 in its definition by the empirical distribution @xmath35 .",
    "note that the estimator @xmath36 is defined for fixed @xmath19 and @xmath17 .      under technical assumptions , we will show that @xmath36 is an asymptotically normal estimator of @xmath9 , namely , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a limiting gaussian process and the convergence in distribution @xmath39 holds in a suitable space of functions ( theorem [ t : an - f_d - sampled ] ) .",
    "the approach and some techniques behind this result are closely related to the works in the so - called decompounding framework by buchmann and grbel @xcite , bgsted and pitts @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these authors consider analogous estimators , but where the sequence @xmath34 in ( [ e : dq - d - wknown ] ) is known and hence so is its reversion sequence @xmath40 .",
    "we thus deviate from these earlier works by assuming that @xmath40 also needs to be estimated , which makes the analysis substantially more complex .",
    "more specifically , the limit @xmath38 in ( [ e : hat - f_d - normal ] ) can be written as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a gaussian process , @xmath43 is a composition operation , @xmath44 is the `` derivative '' of @xmath40 and @xmath45 is the convolution .",
    "the second term in ( [ e : hat - f_d - normal - limit ] ) is the term found in the decompounding literature when @xmath34 and @xmath40 are supposed to be known .",
    "the first term in ( [ e : hat - f_d - normal - limit ] ) is new and accounts for the variations in @xmath32 here .",
    "since @xmath32 involves the estimator @xmath35 via @xmath33 , we also need the asymptotic normality result for @xmath35 .",
    "although @xmath35 already appears in the network traffic literature @xcite , its statistical properties have not been studied before to the best of our knowledge , and the asymptotic normality result is also derived here .",
    "we show that , under suitable assumptions , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a gaussian process ( theorem [ t : an - estim - f - w ] and proposition [ p : an - estim - f - w - function ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the result ( [ e : hat - f_w - normal ] ) is shown under technical assumptions which do not cover distributions with heavier tails ( such as heavy - tailed distributions ) .",
    "it is proved , however , that the assumptions can be thought of as sharp ( in the sense of proposition [ p : necerssary ] of section [ s : number - sampled - to - renewals ] ) .",
    "what the asymptotics of @xmath35 are beyond these assumptions remains an interesting open question .",
    "we would like to make several other related comments .",
    "first , it is well known from estimation of flow sizes in the network traffic context that the performance of the estimator @xmath35 degrades rapidly as the sampling probability @xmath0 decreases .",
    "for example , for @xmath48 , the inference becomes impractical for reasonable sample sizes @xmath8 .",
    "we shall discuss this fact in light of the derived asymptotic normality result for @xmath35 ( sections [ s : number - sampled - to - renewals ] and [ s : simulations - number ] ) by indicating two different regimes for the estimator performance in terms of the limiting asymptotic variance .",
    "the regimes are defined as : @xmath49\\\\ [ -8pt ]      & \\bullet & \\mbox { explosive , if }   \\sup_{w\\in{\\mathbb{n}}}es(\\xi)_w^2 = \\infty,\\nonumber    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the limiting gaussian process in ( [ e : hat - f_w - normal ] ) and @xmath51 is expressed in terms of @xmath0 , and @xmath10 or @xmath52 .",
    "the performance of the estimator @xmath53 is satisfactory in the stable regime , but poor in the explosive regime . for small @xmath0",
    ", @xmath10 typically belongs to the explosive regime and hence to the case of poor performance .",
    "analogous difficulties for smaller @xmath0 remain when using the estimator  @xmath36 .",
    "because of these practical considerations , in the network traffic context , alternative sampling schemes have been sought and considered , such as the sample - and - hold method @xcite , and the dual sampling technique @xcite .",
    "we plan to study inference of interrenewal times in one of these frameworks and postpone any real data application to future work .",
    "this work will therefore be limited to a simulation study ( section [ s : simulation ] ) .    in another direction ,",
    "the results on characterizing the sampled number of renewals and sampled interrenewal times , such as the relation ( [ e : dq - d - wknown ] ) , contribute to a substantial literature on sampling of point processes . sampling ( also known as _ thinning _ )",
    "is discussed in several manuscripts such as @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "sampling ( thinning ) of finite renewal processes has been largely unexplored .",
    "the results of our work ( section [ s : renewal - to - sampled ] ) show that sampling of finite renewal processes does not generally lead to finite renewal processes ( in that , conditionally on the number of sampled renewals , sampled interrenewal times are generally dependent ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ s : preliminaries ] we collect the notation used throughout the work and include other preliminaries .",
    "section [ s : renewal - to - sampled ] concerns properties of the finite point process obtained from sampling the finite renewal process .",
    "inference of the original distributions of the total number of renewals and interrenewal times is studied in section [ s : sampled - to - renewal ] .",
    "a simulation study can be found in section [ s : simulation ] . for better readability ,",
    "most of the proofs are deferred to appendix [ s : proofs ] .",
    "the main body of the article contains the proofs of only those results which we consider key in individual sections .",
    "finally , appendix [ s : appendix - bounds - taylor ] contains a technical result used in section [ s : times - sampled - to - renewals ] , with bounds on remainder terms in taylor expansions of compositions of formal power series .",
    "here , we introduce notation and make a number of assumptions that will be used throughout the paper . as in section [",
    "s : intro ] , we consider a finite renewal process consisting of a finite but random number @xmath1 ( with @xmath54 ) of renewals and positive i.i.d .",
    "interrenewal times @xmath2 , @xmath3 , independent of @xmath1 .",
    "the terminology of finite renewal processes here follows that of @xcite , example  5.3(b ) , page 125 .",
    "we denote by @xmath55 the variable with a common distribution of @xmath2 .",
    "we also let @xmath56 denote the total duration of the finite renewal process defined by @xmath57 ( if @xmath58 , then @xmath59 ) .",
    "suppose now that each renewal , independently of the others , is sampled with a fixed probability @xmath60 to form a sampled finite point process .",
    "we let @xmath5 denote the total number of sampled renewals , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , the sampled interrenewal times and @xmath61 the total duration of the sampled finite point process .",
    "the following notation will be used many times throughout the paper . for a discrete random variable @xmath38 , its distribution or probability mass function ( p.m.f . )",
    "will be denoted by @xmath62 .",
    "for example , we shall write @xmath63 , @xmath64 , etc . for a continuous random variable  @xmath65 , its distribution function will be denoted by @xmath66 and its laplace transform ( lt ) will be denoted by @xmath67 , @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "we shall also use the conditional distribution functions @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",

    "conversely , any such formal power series is associated with a sequence .",
    "when @xmath77 stands for a  p.m.f .",
    "@xmath78 , we shall also write @xmath79 in place of @xmath80 .",
    "since a sequence @xmath77 will not necessarily be nonnegative , we shall also use the notation @xmath81 , defined as @xmath82 , and @xmath83 . in several instances",
    ", we shall use a multidimensional power series @xmath84 associated with @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "we shall also use the following common operations on sequences ( or their formal power series ) @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the composition of @xmath77 and @xmath89 will be denoted @xmath90 and is defined by its formal power series as @xmath91 .",
    "the @xmath92th derivative of @xmath87 will be denoted by @xmath93 and is defined by @xmath94 .",
    "the reversion of a sequence @xmath95 will be defined as a sequence @xmath96 with its formal power series satisfying @xmath97 .",

    "@xmath45 will stand for convolution in either the discrete or continuous setting .",
    "with all these notions for sequences and their formal power series , we follow the nice monograph of  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we study several characteristics of the sampled finite point process in terms of the original finite renewal process .",
