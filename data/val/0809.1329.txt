    "the most important event in neutrino physics of the last decades was the solving of the solar neutrino problem .",
    "the sun appeared in this case as a natural laboratory for investigations of neutrino properties .",
    "there exists a number of natural laboratories , the supernova explosions , where gigantic neutrino fluxes define in fact the process energetics .",
    "it means that microscopic neutrino characteristics , such as the neutrino magnetic moment , etc . , would have a crucial impact on macroscopic properties of these astrophysical events .",
    "one of the processes caused by the photon interaction with the neutrino magnetic moment , which could play an important role in astrophysics , is the radiative neutrino spin flip transition @xmath1 .",
    "the process can be kinematically allowed in medium due to its influence on the photon dispersion , @xmath2 ( here @xmath3 is the refractive index ) , when the medium provides the condition @xmath4 . in this case",
    "the effective photon mass squared is negative , @xmath5 .",
    "this corresponds to the well - known effect of the neutrino cherenkov radiation  @xcite .",
    "there exists also such a well - known subtle effect as the additional energy @xmath6 acquired by a left - handed neutrino in plasma .",
    "this additional energy was considered in the series of papers by studenikin et al .",
    "@xcite as a new kinematical possibility to allow the radiative neutrino transition @xmath1 .",
    "the effect was called the `` spin light of neutrino '' ( @xmath7 ) , and later the similar effect `` spin light of electron '' ( @xmath8 ) was discovered . for unknown reasons , the photon dispersion in medium providing in part the photon effective mass , was ignored in these papers .",
    "however , it is evident that a kinematical analysis based on the additional neutrino or electron energy in matter ( caused by the weak forces ) when the matter influence on the photon dispersion ( caused by electromagnetic forces ) is ignored , can not be considered as a physical approach .",
    "similarly , in the @xmath8 effect the authors  @xcite considered the matter influence on electron by the weak forces and ignored the electromagnetic interaction , taking the unphysical case of a pure neutron medium .",
    "it should be noted that even in the conditions of a cold neutron star , the fraction of electrons and protons can not be exacly zero , @xmath9  @xcite . moreover , even if this unphysical case of a pure neutron medium is considered , one should take into account the electromagnetic interaction of electrons with the magnetic moments of neutrons , which can be much more intensive than the weak interaction effects .",
    "a consistent analysis of the radiative neutrino spin flip transition in medium was performed in our papers  @xcite , where the medium influence both on the photon and neutrino dispersion was taken into account .",
    "it was shown that the threshold arose in the process , caused by the photon ( plasmon ) effective mass .",
    "this threshold left no room for the so - called `` spin light of neutrino '' and `` spin light of electron '' in the real astrophysical situations .",
    "in the series of papers  @xcite the authors declare that they have developed a powerful method of exact solutions of the modified dirac equations including the effective matter potentials .    in this paper , we remind the basic points of our criticism upon the @xmath7 effect , and give some comments on the method of exact solutions  @xcite .",
    "as it was already mentioned , the effect of the `` spin light of neutrino '' proposed in  @xcite was based on the additional left - handed neutrino energy @xmath6 induced by the medium influence .",
    "just this additional energy provides an effective mass squared @xmath10 to the left - handed neutrino , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the neutrino four - momentum in medium , while @xmath13 would form the neutrino four - momentum in vacuum , @xmath14 .",
    "it will be further seen that the neutrino vacuum mass @xmath15 , a great attention was paid to in the @xmath7 analysis  @xcite , may safely be neglected .",
    "given a @xmath16 interaction , caused by the neutrino magnetic moment , the left - handed neutrino effective mass @xmath17  ( [ eq : effective_mass ] ) would open a kinematical possibility for the process @xmath18 , if the photon effective mass is less than @xmath17 .    basing the consideration of the `` spin light of neutrino '' on the additional left - handed neutrino energy , the authors  @xcite , nevertheless , did not analyse this value in detail .",
    "the expression for this additional energy of a left - handed neutrino with the flavor @xmath19 was obtained in the local limit of the weak interaction  @xcite , see also ref .",
    "@xcite , and can be presented in the following form @xmath20 ,   \\label{eq : enulgen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the functions @xmath21 are the number densities of background electrons , protons , neutrons , and neutrinos , and @xmath22 are the densities of the corresponding antiparticles . to find the additional energy for antineutrinos , one should change the total sign in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : enulgen ] ) .    as is seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : enulgen ] ) , this value becomes zero in the charge - symmetric plasma .",
    "this means that the local limit of the weak interaction does not describe comprehensively the additional neutrino energy in plasma , and the non - local weak contribution must be taken into account .",
    "the analysis of this contribution was first performed for the conditions of the early universe  @xcite .    the non - local weak contribution into the additional neutrino energy in plasma , which is identical for both neutrinos and antineutrinos ,",
    "can be presented in the form @xmath23 ,   \\label{eq : w_nloc}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the energy of a neutrino propagating through plasma , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the averaged energies of plasma neutrinos and electrons correspondingly . in a particular case of a charge",
    "symmetric hot plasma , this expressions reproduces the result of refs .",
    "@xcite : @xmath27 the minus sign in  ( [ eq : w_early ] ) unambiguously shows that in the early universe the process of the radiative spin - flip transition is forbidden both for neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "the absolute value of the non - local weak contribution  ( [ eq : w_nloc ] ) grows with the neutrino energy .",
    "it means that this contribution can be essential at ultra - high neutrino energies .",
    "to show manifestly that the case considered in the papers by studenikin et al .",
    "@xcite , with taking the additional left - handed neutrino energy @xmath6 in plasma and ignoring the photon dispersion , was really unphysical , let us consider the region of integration for the @xmath28 conversion width . in fig .",
    "[ fig : disp ] , the photon vacuum dispersion line @xmath29 is inside the allowed kinematical region ( left plot ) , but the plasma influenced photon dispersion curve appears to be outside , if the neutrino energy is not large enough ( right plot ) .",
    "conversion width with the fixed initial neutrino energy @xmath24 is inside the slanted rectangle shown by dashed line .",
    "the vacuum photon dispersion ( if the medium influence is ignored ) is shown by bold line in the left plot .",
    "the photon dispersion curve in plasma is shown by bold line in the right plot .",
    ", scaledwidth=95.0% ]    for the fixed plasma parameters , the threshold neutrino energy @xmath30 exists for coming of the dispersion curve into the allowed kinematical region . even for the interior of a neutron star this threshold",
    "neutrino energy is rather large : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the plasmon frequency .",
    "one could hope that the `` spin light of neutrino '' may be possible at ultra - high neutrino energies .",
    "however , in this case the local limit of the weak interaction is incomplete , and the non - local weak contribution into additional neutrino energy @xmath6 must be taken into account .",
    "this contribution has always a negative sign , and its absolute value grows with the neutrino energy .",
    "one could only hope that the window arises in the neutrino energies for the process to be kinematically opened , @xmath33 .",
    "for example , in the solar interior there is no window for the process with electron neutrinos at all .",
    "a more detailed analysis of this subject was performed in our papers  @xcite .",
    "to construct the amplitudes of the fermion spin - flip conversion processes @xmath0 , it is necessary to know the solutions of the dirac equation including the matter effects . in the series of papers",
    "@xcite the authors declare that they have developed a powerful method of exact solutions of the modified dirac equations in matter .",
    "first of all , there is some progress in the last papers  @xcite with respect to the @xmath7 effect .",
    "namely , the five completely unphysical regions of parameters , which were discussed in details in the previous papers , are removed from the analysis , and only one case of an ultra - high neutrino energy is considered .",
    "however , an essential threshold effect is still not mentioned at all .",
    "an incorrect statement is repeated in  @xcite that our results  @xcite for the case of an ultra - high neutrino energy exactly reproduce the results of the authors  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the width for the process @xmath18 obtained in our papers  @xcite had much more general form being valid for arbitrary neutrino energies above the threshold , while the process width presented in  @xcite could be valid for the neutrino energies much greater than the threshold .    as in the previous papers , the non - local weak contribution into the additional neutrino energy in plasma is not taken into account in  @xcite , while it is essential at ultra - high neutrino energies . without this non - local weak contribution , the dirac equation in medium for a neutrino is approximate by definition , and the term of an `` exact solution '' becomes dubious .    making an attempt of constructing a new approach to the description of the neutrino and electron processes in matter , the authors  @xcite refer to the method of exact solutions developed for the processes in a strong external electromagnetic field .",
    "however , it is not a good justification . the strong field influence on the properties of charged particles is the essential non - perturbative effect where the analysis of the quantum processes , based just on exact solutions , is required . on the other hand , the matter influence on the neutrino and electron processes due to",
    "the weak interaction is essentially perturbative in any conceivable astrophysical conditions .",
    "moreover , the explicit form of the modified dirac equation is rather simple in the low - energy approximation only , when the modification is caused by the additional left - handed neutrino energy in the form  ( [ eq : enulgen ] ) calculated in the local limit of the weak interaction . as it was mentioned above , for high neutrino energies the non - local weak contribution  ( [ eq : w_nloc ] ) growing linearly with the neutrino energy ,",
    "appears to be essential . and",
    "even this non - local term  ( [ eq : w_nloc ] ) is nothing but the result of the expansion of the @xmath6-boson propagator over the parameter @xmath34 .",
    "it is obvious that such an expansion has a physical sence for the neutrino energies @xmath35 tev .",
    "so , if one pretends to describe the additional left - handed neutrino energy in matter for the neutrino energies much higher the threshold energy  ( [ eq : threshold ] ) , an exact calculation is required without expanding the @xmath6-boson propagator . in this case",
    "the modified dirac equation should take the form of the integro - differential equation .",
    "without such an analysis , speculations on exact solutions of the modified dirac equation in matter have no ground .",
    "* we have shown that an approach based on a subtle effect of the medium influence on the neutrino dispersion , when the much more significant influence of the same medium on the photon dispersion is ignored , has no physical sense . * with the photon dispersion taken into account , the threshold neutrino energy exists for the process @xmath18 , which is very large .",
    "* at ultra - high neutrino energies , the non - local weak contribution into the additional neutrino energy in plasma must be taken into account .",
    "there arises the window ( if exists ) in the neutrino energies for the process to be kinematically opened , @xmath36 .",
    "* without the non - local weak contribution into the additional neutrino energy in plasma , the dirac equation in medium for a neutrino is approximate by definition , and the term of an `` exact solution '' becomes dubious .",
