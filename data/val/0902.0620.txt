    "fair allocation of goods or resources among various agents is a central task in multiagent systems and other fields .",
    "the specific setting where just one divisible resource is to be divided fairly is commonly referred to as cake - cutting , and agents are called players in this setting .",
    "research in the area of cake - cutting started off in the 1940s with the pioneering work of steinhaus  @xcite who , to the best of our knowledge , was the first to introduce the problem of fair division . dividing a good ( or a resource ) fairly among several players such that each of them is satisfied with",
    "the portion received is of central importance in many fields . in the last 60 years",
    "this research area has developed vividly , spreading out into various directions and with applications in areas as diverse as economics , mathematics , computer science , and psychology .",
    "while some lines of this research seek to find reasonable interpretations of what `` fairness '' really stands for and how to measure it  @xcite , others are concerned more with proofs of existence or impossibility theorems regarding fair division @xcite , or with the development of new cake - cutting procedures  @xcite and , relatedly , with the analysis of their complexity relative to both upper and lower bounds @xcite .",
    "since cake - cutting procedures involve several parties ( namely , the players ) , they are also referred to as `` protocols . ''",
    "cake - cutting protocols aim at achieving a _ fair _ division of an infinitely divisible resource among @xmath2 players , who each may have different preferences for ( and thus different valuations of ) different parts of the resource . in this paper",
    ", we focus on ( a notion of ) fairness in finite bounded cake - cutting protocols .",
    "many cake - cutting protocols are known today , both finite and continuous ones . while a _ finite _ protocol always provides a solution after only a finite number of decisions",
    "have been made , a _",
    "protocol could potentially run forever . among finite protocols",
    ", one can further distinguish between bounded and unbounded ones .",
    "a finite _ bounded _ cake - cutting protocol is present if we know in advance that a certain number of steps ( that may depend on the number of players ) will suffice to divide the resource fairly  independently of how the players may value distinct parts of the resource in a particular case and independently of the strategies chosen by the players .",
    "in contrast , in finite _ unbounded _ cake - cutting protocols , we can not predict an upper bound on how many steps will be required to achieve the same goal . aiming to apply cake - cutting procedures to real - world scenarios , it is important to develop fair _ finite bounded _ cake - cutting protocols . in this context ,",
    "`` fairness '' is often interpreted as meaning `` envy - freeness . ''",
    "a division is _ envy - free _ if no player has an incentive to switch his or her portion with the portion any other player received .",
    "steinhaus  @xcite proved that for any number of players an envy - free division of a single divisible good always exists .",
    "however , the current state of the art  after six decades of intense research  is that for arbitrary @xmath2 , and even for @xmath3 , the development of _ finite bounded _ envy - free cake - cutting protocols still appears to be out of reach , and a big challenge for future research . for @xmath4 players , hardly any envy - free cake - cutting protocol is known , and the ones that are known are either finite unbounded or continuous ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "though , from an implementation perspective , finite bounded protocols are the ones that are most desirable .",
    "recently , stromquist  @xcite has shown that for more than two players there is no finite cake - cutting protocol that provides an envy - free division when all portions are required to consist of contiguous pieces .",
    "our goal in this paper is to look for compromises that can be made with respect to envy - freeness while keeping the protocol finite bounded : we propose an approach to evaluate finite bounded ( yet possibly non - envy - free ) cake - cutting protocols with respect to their `` degree of guaranteed envy - freeness '' ( dgef ) .",
    "informally put , this notion provides a measure of how good such a protocol can approximate the ( possibly for this particular protocol unreachable ) ideal of envy - freeness in terms of the number of envy - free - relations that are guaranteed to exist even in the worst case .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . after defining some basic notions in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] ,",
    "we introduce the notion of degree of guaranteed envy - freeness , and specify the dgef for some well - known finite bounded proportional cake - cutting protocols in section  [ sec : guaranteed - envy - freeness ] . in section  [ sec : improved - algorithm - guaranteed - envy - freeness ] we present a new finite bounded proportional cake - cutting protocol with an enhanced degree of guaranteed envy - freeness , compared with the proportional protocols mentioned in section  [ sec : guaranteed - envy - freeness ] .",
    "this new cake - cutting protocol makes use of parallelization in order to include as many matching valuations ( in terms of not raising envy ) as possible .",
    "section  [ sec : survey ] briefly describes those protocols mentioned in section  [ sec : guaranteed - envy - freeness ] , and determines their degree of guaranteed envy - freeness via a detailed analysis . in section  [ sec : discussion ] , we compare the dgef approach with related work , and show that even small steps toward the development of cake - cutting protocols with an enhanced dgef are of significance .",
    "finally , we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] that our approach extends the scope for the development of new finite bounded cake - cutting protocols by `` approximating '' envy - freeness instead of insisting on it .",
    "cake - cutting is about dividing a cake into portions that are assigned to the players such that each of them feels , according to his or her individual valuation of the portions , to have received a fair amount of the cake .",
    "the cake is assumed to be infinitely divisible , and can be divided into arbitrary pieces without losing any of its value .",
    "moreover , we assume the cake to be heterogeneous . this assumption can be made without loss of generality , as any cake - cutting protocol providing a `` fair '' division of a heterogeneous resource can be applied in the same way to a homogeneous one @xcite .",
    "given @xmath2 players , cake @xmath5 is to be divided into @xmath2 portions that are to be distributed among the players so as to satisfy each of them .",
    "a portion is not necessarily a single piece of cake but rather can be a collection of disjoint , possibly noncontiguous pieces of  @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , all players may have different individual valuations of the single pieces of the cake .",
    "for example , one player may prefer the pieces with the chocolate topping , whereas another player may prefer the pieces with the cherry topping .",
    "more formally , cake @xmath5 is represented by the unit interval @xmath6 $ ] of real numbers . by performing cuts",
    ", @xmath5 is divided into @xmath7 pieces @xmath8 , @xmath9 : each player  @xmath10 , @xmath11 , assigns value @xmath12 to piece @xmath13 , where @xmath8 is represented by the subinterval @xmath14 \\subseteq [ 0,1]$ ] and @xmath10 s valuation function @xmath15 maps subintervals of @xmath6 $ ] to real numbers in @xmath6 $ ] .",

    "for example , robertson and webb  @xcite and woeginger and sgall  @xcite require nonnegative values for nonempty pieces of cake , whereas positive values for such pieces are required by brams and taylor  @xcite , brams , jones , and klamler  @xcite , and weller  @xcite .",

    "the assumption that @xmath5 is heterogeneous formally means that subintervals of @xmath6 $ ] having equal size can be valued differently by the same player .",
    "moreover , distinct players may value one and the same piece of the cake differently , i.e. , their individual valuation functions will in general be distinct .",

    "a cake - cutting protocol describes an interactive procedure for obtaining a division of a given cake , without having any information on the valuation functions of the players involved .",
    "each protocol is characterized by a set of rules and a set of strategies ( see , e.g. , brams and taylor  @xcite ) .",
    "the rules just determine the course of action , such as a request to cut the cake , whereas the strategies define how to achieve a certain degree of fairness , e.g. , by advising the players where to cut the cake .",
    "if all players obey the protocol , it is guaranteed that every player receives a `` fair '' portion of the cake .",
    "cake - cutting protocols are characterized according to the degree of fairness of the divisions obtained :    [ def : proportional - strongfair - envyfree - protocol ] a cake - cutting protocol is said to be _ simple fair _ ( or _ proportional _ ) , _ strong fair _ , and _ envy - free _ , respectively , if every division obtained ( i.e. , regardless of which valuation functions the players have ) is simple fair ( or proportional ) , strong fair , and envy - free , respectively , provided that all players follow the rules and strategies of the protocol .    apparently , every division obtained by either a strong fair cake - cutting protocol or by an envy - free cake - cutting protocol is simple fair as well ( i.e. , every strong fair or envy - free cake - cutting protocol can be classified as being simple fair , too ) .",
    "moreover , every simple fair cake - cutting protocol can easily be applied to the case when there are unequal shares to be assigned , though with respect to rational ratios only . informally speaking ,",
    "this can be done by cloning players and their valuation functions so as to have in total as many players as the smallest common denominator specifies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the design of envy - free cake - cutting protocols for any number @xmath2 of players seems to be quite a challenge . for @xmath48  players ,",
    "a number of protocols that always provide envy - free divisions have been published , both finite ( bounded and unbounded ) and continuous ones  @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge , up to date no finite bounded cake - cutting protocol for @xmath4  players is known to always provide an envy - free division . for practical purposes , it would be most desirable to have _ finite bounded _ cake - cutting protocols that always provide divisions as fair as possible . in this regard , it is questionable whether the advantage of always having an envy - free rather than just a proportional division would be big enough to justify the lack of finite boundedness",
    ". it may be worthwhile to be content with a certain lower degree of envy - freeness , rather than insisting on complete envy - freeness , for the benefit of having a finite bounded protocol in exchange .    in this paper",

    "the higher the degree of guaranteed envy - freeness the fairer the protocol .",
    "we now give an upper and a lower bound on the degree of guaranteed envy - freeness for proportional cake - cutting protocols . for comparison ,",
    "note that feldman and kirman  @xcite observed that , for _ any _ division , the number of envy - relations is always between zero and @xmath50 ; zero if everyone is happy with his or her share of the cake , and @xmath50 if everyone is envious of everyone else .",

    "`` appropriate rules '' are those that involve the players evaluations of other players portions and of pieces that still are to be assigned .",

    "thus , in each round , for each player involved in this round , one envy - free - relation is guaranteed to exist .",
    "note that , for each subprocedure in any round except the final one , the numbers of players to be continued with in the resulting two subprocedures of the following round depend on whether the total number of players involved in the given subprocedure is even or odd .    from these remarks",
    "it follows that the divide and conquer protocol s degree of guaranteed envy - freeness , call it @xmath79 for @xmath2 players , can be described by the following recurrence : @xmath174 apparently , this recurrence relation can be simplified to : @xmath175    the recurrence in  ( [ eq : rec - solution - divide - conquer ] ) and similar versions are well known to occur also in other contexts .",
    "it is a matter of routine ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) to solve it ( i.e. , to bring it into closed form ) : @xmath176    how does equation  ( [ eq : solution - divide - conquer ] ) reflect the guaranteed number of envy - free - relations of the divide and conquer protocol ? as mentioned before , this protocol can be considered as a collection of several subprocedures that altogether yield a proportional division of the given cake .",
    "this collection of subprocedures can be represented as a balanced binary tree ( called the `` recursion tree '' ) , because in every subprocedure the given subpart of the cake is cut into two pieces for which the procedure is applied recursively again and again until just one player remains in each resulting subprocedure .",
    "since the depth of a balanced binary tree is logarithmic in the number of leaves , @xmath177 rounds are performed in total . if the number @xmath2  of players is not a power of two , every round except for the last one ( i.e. , @xmath178 rounds ) is represented by a completely filled level of the binary tree in terms of the number of players , since all @xmath2  players are participating in these rounds  in different subprocedures though .",
    "note that @xmath2 is a power of two if and only if it holds that @xmath179 ( i.e. , the final round is numbered @xmath180 ) , and only in this case , all @xmath2  players are involved in each of the rounds , even in the final round .",
    "recall that , in each round , every participating player will not envy at least one of the players continuing with the particular other piece , since he or she considers this piece to be of no more value than the one he or she is continuing with , i.e. , in each round one guaranteed envy - free - relation is created on behalf of each of the participating players .",
    "for this reason , @xmath2  envy - free - relations are guaranteed to be created in each of the first @xmath178 rounds .",
    "this is because in subsequent rounds the particular subparts to be divided will never get bigger again , and once two players have ended up in different subprocedures , they will never meet again in the same subprocedure of any of the following rounds .",
    "moreover , once a player has ended up in some group , he or she will not make future evaluations of pieces of the cake to be divided among the players in the other group .",
    "thus , those envy - free - relations that result from any of the first @xmath178 rounds are guaranteed to persist until all the cake has been allocated .",
    "however , it can not be determined which of the players continuing with the other piece of the particular subpart is not envied , since no evaluations of the pieces created in other subprocedures are made . in accordance with the proof of lemma  [ lem : dgef - no - evaluations ] ,",
    "the latter also justifies why no more envy - free - relations can be guaranteed .",
    "hence , it can just be guaranteed that each player does not envy at least one of the players continuing with the other piece .",
    "summing up , as exactly @xmath2 guaranteed envy - free - relations are created in each of the first @xmath178 rounds , @xmath181 guaranteed envy - free - relations are created over all rounds , except for the final round if @xmath2 is not a power of two . note that if @xmath2 is a power of two , the @xmath182th round is the final round and equation  ( [ eq : solution - divide - conquer ] ) simplifies to @xmath183 , so in this case we are done .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath2 is not a power of two then less than @xmath2  players will be involved in the final round ( i.e. , in the round numbered @xmath184 ) , since in that case there is at least one subprocedure that involves an odd number of players .",
    "more specifically , in this case the number of players involved in the final round can be expressed by the term @xmath185 , where @xmath186 specifies the number of players that would be involved in the final round if the binary recursion tree would be a full binary tree , i.e. , if all @xmath2  players would be involved in the final round . in order to analyze the final round for @xmath2 not being a power of two in detail , let @xmath41-subprocedure denote a subprocedure involving exactly @xmath41 players . a @xmath187-subprocedure can occur only in the second - to - last round , and if it occurs then one of its three players can not be participating in the final round , i.e. , only two out of three players are proceeding to the final round . since in a balanced binary tree",
    "the depth of all leaves differs by at most one , the second - to - last round can have only either @xmath188-subprocedures and/or @xmath187-subprocedures , or @xmath189-subprocedures and/or @xmath187-subprocedures . regarding a second - to -",
    "last round with at least one @xmath187-subprocedure and any number of @xmath188-subprocedures ( which can happen only if @xmath2 is not a power of two ) , the number of players involved in the final round will be twice the number of @xmath187-subprocedures occurring in the second - to - last round . regarding a second - to -",
    "last round with at least one @xmath187-subprocedure and any number of @xmath189-subprocedures ( which again can happen only if @xmath2 is not a power of two ) , the number of players involved in the final round will be twice the number of @xmath187-subprocedures plus four times the number of @xmath189-subprocedures . consequently ,",
    "the number of @xmath187-subprocedures and the number of @xmath189-subprocedures in the second - to - last round determine how many players are participating in the final round , and thus also determine the number of guaranteed envy - free - relations to be created in the final round .",
    "if @xmath2 is not a power of two , analogously to the argument for the first @xmath178 rounds , also in the final round one guaranteed envy - free - relation is created with respect to each participating player .",
    "thus , for any number @xmath76 of players , at least @xmath185 guaranteed envy - free - relations are created in the @xmath190th round .",
    "is a power of two if and only if @xmath191 , and that in this case there is no @xmath190th round . ]",
    "according to the proof of lemma  [ lem : dgef - no - evaluations ] , no more than that many envy - free - relations can be guaranteed .",
    "altogether , this sums up to @xmath192 guaranteed envy - free - relations in total , which is the number stated in equation  ( [ eq : solution - divide - conquer ] ) .",
    "the degree of guaranteed envy - freeness of the minimal - envy divide and conquer protocol can be shown just as for the original divide and conquer protocol .",
    "the difference in the way of splitting the particular piece of the cake into two subpieces does not affect the number of guaranteed envy - free - relations .",
    "consequently , although the minimal - envy divide and conquer protocol does decrease envy according to the definition of brams , jones , and klamler  @xcite ( see section  [ sec : discussion ] for more discussion of this point ) , its dgef is @xmath192 , just as for the original divide and conquer protocol .",
    "this protocol has been presented by tasndi  @xcite and describes a recursive procedure for how to always achieve a proportional division .",
    "it works as follows : in the case of @xmath82 , this is just the simple cut - and - choose protocol . in the case of @xmath137 , one of the players , the `` divider",
    ", '' divides the cake into three equal pieces according to his or her measure , and each of the two other players , the `` choosers , '' marks two pieces he or she considers to be worth the most , where ties may be broken arbitrarily .",
    "if both choosers marked the same two pieces , they divide these by applying the simple cut - and - choose protocol , and the divider receives the remaining piece .",
    "if the choosers marked different pieces , they divide the piece they both have marked via the simple cut - and - choose protocol , and each of the choosers divides the piece marked by just him- or herself with the divider , again via applying the simple cut - and - choose protocol .    in the case of @xmath4 players , this procedure",
    "is repeated recursively until all comes down to the simple cut - and - choose protocol involving two players only . in more detail , in the first round the divider cuts the cake into @xmath2 equal pieces according to his or her measure , and each of the @xmath49 choosers marks @xmath49  pieces he or she considers to be worth the most , where ties may be broken arbitrarily .",
    "afterwards , a new round is started and each of the @xmath2  pieces is divided among those @xmath49 choosers that identified this piece as being acceptable .",
    "concerning pieces that have been marked by less than @xmath49  choosers , the divider fills out these empty slots by an appropriate number of clones . in other words ,",
    "each of the @xmath2  pieces enters the next round of the protocol and induces a new subprocedure in the scope of which the particular piece is being divided among @xmath49 players .",
    "all @xmath2  subprocedures are executed simultaneously but independently of each other .",
    "note that if in the very first round all @xmath49  choosers marked the same @xmath49  pieces as being acceptable than there is exactly one piece that has not been marked by any of the choosers . in this case , this piece is directly assigned to the divider and the divider drops out , whereas all choosers enter the next round for dividing the @xmath49  remaining pieces among them .",
    "analogously , in the @xmath113th round , @xmath114 , there are @xmath193  subprocedures , i.e. , @xmath193  pieces are to be divided simultaneously but independently among @xmath194  players each . in every subprocedure",
    "any one player is determined to be the divider and cuts the particular piece of this subprocedure into @xmath194  equal subpieces according to his or her measure .",
    "afterwards , each of the @xmath115  choosers of this particular subprocedure marks @xmath115  pieces he or she considers to be worth the most , where ties may be broken arbitrarily .",
    "each of the @xmath194  pieces will induce a new subprocedure in the next round and will be divided among those @xmath115  players that marked this piece as being acceptable  where the divider fills out all empty slots regarding pieces that have been marked by less than @xmath115  choosers .",
    "again , if in some round @xmath113 , @xmath114 , in any of the subprocedures , all @xmath115  choosers agree on the same @xmath115  pieces , then there will be exactly one piece that has not been marked by any of the choosers . in this case",
    ", the unmarked piece is directly assigned to the divider of this particular subprocedure , and in the following rounds , the divider will not be involved in any of the subprocedures that results from this one , i.e. , only @xmath115  pieces enter the next round , in which these are to be divided among the @xmath115  choosers of the previous round .",
    "nevertheless , this divider will enter the next round and will participate in all those subprocedures that result from procedures he has not dropped out from yet .    applying this procedure recursively until only two players remain in each subprocedure ( i.e. , running  @xmath49 rounds ) , and dividing the corresponding piece of the cake between these two via the simple cut - and - choose protocol , the recursive divide and choose protocol provides a proportional division of the cake .",
    "[ lem : divide - and - choose ] the recursive divide and choose protocol has a degree of guaranteed envy - freeness of  @xmath2 .    for @xmath0  players , no evaluations of entire portions are made  except for the one special case when the first - round divider drops out in the very first round ( which , for the sake of self - containment , will be considered separately below)and thus the scenario from the proof of lemma  [ lem : dgef - no - evaluations ] is applicable .",
    "simply put , only @xmath2  envy - free - relations can be guaranteed in every case due to the argument in the proof of proposition  [ prop : dgef - minimum - maximum ] , as the missing evaluations of entire portions allow for any valuation functions , for example , those described in the proof of lemma  [ lem : dgef - no - evaluations ] .",
    "if in the very first round all @xmath49  choosers agree on the very same @xmath49  pieces then the first - round divider will drop out with a portion that he or she values exactly @xmath87 and that all other players value at most @xmath87 .",
    "this results in @xmath2 guaranteed envy - free - relations , since none of the @xmath49  choosers will envy the first - round divider and the first - round divider will not envy at least one of the other players by the argument in the proof of proposition  [ prop : dgef - minimum - maximum ] . however , in this case no more envy - free - relations can be guaranteed in the following rounds due to the argument given above . consequently , the dgef of the recursive divide and choose protocol is  @xmath2 .",
    "the analysis of envy - relations dates back at least to feldman and kirman  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to our approach , they consider the number of envy - pairs in already existing divisions with the intention of maximizing fairness afterwards via trading .",
    "in particular , they do not consider the _ design _ of cake - cutting protocols that maximize fairness . in the majority of cases ,",
    "research in the area of cake - cutting from an economic perspective is concerned more with the existence of certain divisions and their properties than with how to achieve these divisions .",
    "a different approach measures the intensity of envy in terms of the distance between envied portions  @xcite .",
    "more recently , brams , jones , and klamler  @xcite proposed to minimize envy in terms of the maximum number of players that a player may envy .",
    "their notion of measuring envy differs from our notion of dgef in various ways , the most fundamental of which is that their notion takes an `` egalitarian '' approach to reducing the number of envy - relations ( namely , via minimizing the most - envious player s envy , in terms of decreasing the number of this single player s envy - relations ) .",
    "in contrast , the dgef aims at a `` utilitarian '' approach ( namely , via minimizing overall envy , in terms of increasing the total number of guaranteed envy - free - relations among all players ) . that is to say that , although these notions may seem to be very similar at first glance , the approach presented in  @xcite is not sensitive to a reduction in the number of envy - relations on the part of any other than the most - envious player , whereas the dgef does take each single improvement into account and adapts accordingly .",
    "the dgef , thus , is a more specific , more fine - tuned measure .",
    "note also that brams , jones , and klamler  @xcite focus primarily on presenting a new protocol and less so on introducing a new notion for measuring envy .",
    "another approach is due to chevaleyre et al .",
    "@xcite , who define various metrics for the evaluation of envy in order to classify `` the degree of envy in a society , '' and they use the term `` degree of envy '' in the quite different setting of multiagent allocation of _ indivisible _ resources .    besides , we stress that our approach of approximating envy - freeness differs from other lines of research that also deal with approximating fairness . for example , lipton et al .",
    "@xcite propose to seek for minimum - envy allocations of _ indivisible _ goods in terms of the value difference of the utility functions of envied players , and edmonds and pruhs  @xcite approximate fairness in cake - cutting protocols by allowing merely approximately fair pieces ( in terms of their value to the players ) and by using only approximate cut queries ( in terms of exactness ) .",
    "it may be tempting to seek to decrease envy ( and thus to increase the dgef ) via trading , aiming to get rid of potential circular envy - relations .",
    "although we do not consider trading to be an integral part of a cake - cutting protocol , let us for a moment digress to briefly discuss how trading may potentially affect the number of guaranteed envy - free - relations .",
    "indeed , if the dgef is _ lower than  @xmath195 _ , the number of guaranteed envy - free - relations can be improved to this lower bound , or to an even higher number , by resolving circular envy - relations ( of which two - way envy - relations are a special case ) by means of circular trades after the execution of the protocol .",
    "thus , in this case , involving subsequent trading actions adds on the number of guaranteed envy - free - relations .",
    "furthermore , having exactly @xmath195 guaranteed envy - free - relations after all circular envy - relations have been resolved , three more guaranteed envy - free - relations can be gained by applying an envy - free protocol ( e.g. , the selfridge",
    " conway protocol ) to the three most envied players , which yields to an overall lower bound of  @xmath196 guaranteed envy - free - relations . to give an example for an even higher impact of trading , when circular trades indeed are involved after executing either the divide and conquer protocol or the minimal - envy divide and conquer protocol ,",
    "their numbers of guaranteed envy - free relations can be improved to  @xmath197 , which follows from  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if the dgef of a proportional cake - cutting protocol is _",
    "@xmath195 or higher _",
    "( such as the dgef of the protocol presented in figure  [ algo : n ] ) then  depending on the protocol ",
    "circular envy - relations may not be _ guaranteed _ to exist , and if such cycles are not guaranteed to exist , trading has no impact on the number of guaranteed envy - free - relations .",
    "however , as mentioned above , we consider trading not to be part of a cake - cutting protocol , though it might be useful in certain cases ( for example , brams and taylor  @xcite mention that trading might be used `` to obtain better allocations ; however , this is not a procedure but an informal adjustment mechanism '' ) . in particular",
    ", the notion of dgef refers to ( proportional ) cake - cutting protocols without additional trading , i.e. , the dgef is defined to make a statement on the performance of a particular protocol and not about all sorts of actions to be undertaken afterwards .",
    "although the well - known protocols listed in table  [ tab : dgef - survey ] have not been developed with a focus on maximizing the dgef , mentioned above . ] linking their degrees of guaranteed envy - freeness to the lower bound provided by involving , e.g. , the selfridge ",
    "conway protocol and guaranteed trading opportunities indicates that the development of cake - cutting protocols with a considerably higher dgef or even with a dgef close to the maximum of  @xmath50 poses a true challenge .",
    "that is why we feel that the enhanced dgef of the protocol presented in figure  [ algo : n ] constitutes a significant improvement .",
    "although different disciplines are engaged in the development of fair cake - cutting protocols for decades now , finite bounded protocols that guarantee an envy - free division for @xmath138 players are still a mystery . however , finite bounded protocols are the ones we are looking for in terms of practical implementations .",
    "that is why we in this paper have proposed to weaken the requirement of envy - freeness ( as much as needed and as little as possible ) , while insisting on finite boundedness . to this end",
    ", we introduced the notion of degree of guaranteed envy - freeness for proportional cake - cutting protocols .",
    "based on this definition , we gave a survey of the dgef in existing finite bounded proportional cake - cutting protocols , which shows that when one is trying to approximate the ideal of envy - freeness via the dgef , there is quite a bit room for improvements .",
    "in particular , we expect that the concept of dgef is suitable to extend the scope for the development of new finite bounded cake - cutting protocols by allowing to approximate envy - freeness step by step . in this context , we proposed a new finite bounded proportional cake - cutting protocol , explicitly demonstrated for @xmath3 and for arbitrary  @xmath0 , which provides a significantly enhanced degree of guaranteed envy - freeness , compared with the status quo given by the survey in table  [ tab : dgef - survey ] ( see also section  [ sec : survey ] ) .",
    "in particular , our protocol has @xmath198 more guaranteed envy - free - relations than the last diminisher protocol , which previously was the best finite bounded proportional cake - cutting protocol with respect to the dgef . to achieve this significantly enhanced dgef , our protocol makes use of parallelization with respect to the leftmost and the rightmost pieces . in this regard , adjusting the values of the pieces to be marked from @xmath87 to @xmath199 ( with @xmath158 players still in the game ) and applying an appropriate inner - loop procedure is crucial to make the parallelization work .",
    "in addition to an enhanced dgef , our protocol still has the other useful properties the last diminisher protocol is known to possess , such as strategy - proofness .    in general , we suggest to target improvements on the `` level of envy - freeness '' already in the design of cake - cutting protocols rather than trying to improve on the number of envy - free - relations afterwards for the division obtained ( e.g. , via trading  @xcite ) . in terms of future research , this approach encourages to develop new protocols with even higher degrees of guaranteed envy - freeness  one may even think of modifications that focus on the development of protocols with `` balanced envy - freeness '' while keeping the dgef high .",
