    "still , even in that case thickness of the heating region is much smaller than the region of spin - flipping , and fraction of the molecules in the metastable state is close to unity at the isothermal discontinuity , @xmath151 .",
    "thus , as an intermediate conclusion , thermal conduction influences only the temperature profile in magnetic detonation , with a minor effect on density and pressure , and with negligible modifications of the total front thickness .",
    "much more dramatic modifications of the magnetic detonation structure are expected because of volume viscosity as shown in the next section .",

    "while shear viscosity is not typical for solid state processes such as magnetic detonation in crystals of nanomagnets , volume viscosity has to be considered .",

    "for very small viscosity , @xmath162 , the transition line ( blue ) , although continuous , goes pretty close to the hugoniot curve for the shock and then to the tangent line for the spin - flipping process . in a similar way , in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile_visc_p ] the plot for @xmath162 demonstrates quite abrupt initial pressure increase  almost jump , which resembles strongly a discontinuous shock wave ; this pressure increase is followed by pressure relaxation to a smaller value in the process of spin - flipping with zeeman energy release . as we take larger values of volume viscosity",

    "in the present paper we have investigated the internal structure of magnetic detonation in crystals of nanomagnets .",
    "magnetic detonation is weak and propagates with speed only slightly exceeding the sound speed in the crystals .",
    "for that reason , in stark contrast to usual combustion detonations , transport processes  thermal conduction and volume viscosity  play an important role in forming the magnetic detonation structure .",
    "we show that , in the case of negligible volume viscosity , thermal conduction produces isothermal discontinuity instead of the leading shock in magnetic detonation . in the isothermal discontinuity temperature of the crystal is continuous , while density and pressure experience jump .",
    "volume viscosity leads to much more dramatic changes of the magnetic detonation structure as compared to the model of ref .",
    "[ ] with neglected transport processes . in that case",
    "all important thermodynamic parameters of the crystals acquire smooth profiles all over the magnetic detonation front including the leading shock .",
    "in addition , the very concept of the leading shock requires unambiguous definition  here we suggest to specify the back side of the shock as the position of the pressure maximum .",
    "as the relative role of volume viscosity increases , the leading shock becomes wider and may exceed considerably the zone of spin - flipping by size . still , total size of a magnetic detonation front does not change much with variations of volume viscosity since decrease of the spin - flipping region is compensated by increase of the shock width ."
