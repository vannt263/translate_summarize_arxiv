    "in particular , it accounts for the induced energy gap that depends on the contact resistance .",
    "however , it can not describe spatially - dependent problems in 2d systems nor can it be easily extended to time - dependent or non - equilibrium phenomena .    in the present paper",
    "we develop an approach which is suitable for spatially inhomogeneous and/or time - dependent problems associated with the induced superconductivity in 2d systems placed in a contact with a bulk superconductor .",
