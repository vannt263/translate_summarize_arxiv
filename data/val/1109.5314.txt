    "the composition of relativistic jets or outflows in different astrophysical sources , and in particular their degree of magnetization , is highly uncertain and of great interest .",
    "pulsar winds are almost certainly poynting flux dominated near the central source , and the same most likely also holds for active galatic nuclei ( agn ) and tidal disruption events ( tdes ) of a star by a super - massive black hole . in agn and tdes , since the central accreting black hole is super - massive , then even close to it the thompson optical depth @xmath1 may not be high enough for thermal acceleration by radiation pressure  the main competition to magnetic acceleration  to work efficiently ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in grbs or micro - quasars , however , thermal acceleration could also work ( @xmath2 is possible , or even likely ) , and the dominant acceleration mechanism is less clear .",
    "one of the most important open questions about outflows that start out highly magnetized near the central source is how they convert most of their initial electromagnetic energy to other forms , namely bulk kinetic energy or the energy in the random motions of the particles , which also produce the radiation we observe from these sources .",
    "observations of relevant sources , such as agn , grbs or pulsar wind nebulae suggest that the outflow magnetization is rather low at large distances from the source .",
    "this is known as the @xmath3 problem , namely how to transform from @xmath4 near the source to @xmath5 very far from the source , where the magnetization parameter @xmath3 is the poynting - to - matter energy flux ratio .",
    "different approaches to this problem have been considered so far .",
    "outflows that are poynting flux dominated near the source are usually treated under ideal mhd , axi - symmetry and steady - state ( minaly for simplicity ) . under these conditions , however , it is hard to achieve @xmath6 ( or @xmath5 ) far from the source that would enable efficient energy dissipation in internal shocks  @xcite .",
    "one possible solution to this problem is that the magnetization remains high ( @xmath4 ) also at large distances from the source and the observed emission is powered by magnetic reconnection rather than by internal shocks  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the non - axi - symmetric kink instability could randomize the direction of the magnetic field , causing it to behave more like a fluid and enhancing magnetic reconnection , which both increase the acceleration and help lower the magnetization  @xcite .",
    "another option that may be relevant for agn and grbs  @xcite , is that if the poynting flux dominated outflow has alternating fields ( e.g. a striped wind ) then the kruskal - schwarzschild instability ( i.e. the magnetic version of the rayleigh - taylor instability ) of the current sheets could lead to significant magnetic reconnection , which in turn increases the initial acceleration resulting in a positive feedback and self - sustained acceleration that leads to a low @xmath3 .",
    "while most previous works have assumed a steady state ( i.e. no time dependence ) , here the focus is on the effects of strong time dependence ",
    "impulsive outflows that are initially highly magnetized , under ideal mhd .",
    "* hereafter paper i ) have recently found a new impulsive magnetic acceleration mechanism for relativistic outflows , which is qualitatively different from its newtonian analog  @xcite , and can lead to kinetic energy dominance and low magnetizations that allow for efficient dissipation in internal shocks .",
    "paper i focused mainly on the acceleration of an initially highly magnetized shell of plasma into vacuum , and only briefly discussed the effects of its interaction with the external medium . here",
    "i analyze in detail the effects of its interaction with an unmagnetized external medium whose density varies as a power - law with the distance from the central source .",
    "most astrophysical relativistic outflow sources , such as agn , micro - quasars or pulsar wind nebulae ( pwn ) , operate more or less steadily over long periods of time . therefore , the deceleration of their outflow due to its interaction with external medium becomes important only at very large distances from the source ( at the `` hot spots '' near the leading edge of agn or micro - quasar jets and at the wind termination shock in pwn ) .",
    "agn or micro - quasar jets occasionally produce bright flares , which likely correspond to a sudden and short lived large increase in their jet power ( or energy output rate ) .",
    "if the resulting ejected shell ( or blob ) of plasma is highly magnetized then it can accelerate by the impulsive mechanism found in paper i. since it would be propagating in the evacuated channel cleared by the preceding long lived steady outflow from the same source , the deceleration by the external medium would become important only well after the acceleration is over .",
    "there are , however , also sources that are both impulsive and short - lived , such as grbs , tdes or potentially also relativistic outflows from giant flares in soft gamma - repeaters .",
    "in such sources the deceleration because of the interaction with the external medium can become important already during the acceleration stage , and this may have important implications for our understanding of these sources and the interpretation of their observations .    the deceleration of an unmagnetized uniform relativistic shell through its interaction with the external medium has been studied in the context of grbs @xcite .",
    "the main results are summarized and extended to a general power - law ( with the distance from the central source ) external density profile in    [ sec : low - sigma ] .",
    "the deceleration of a uniform magnetized relativistic shell by an unmagnetized external medium has also been studied  @xcite .",
    "however , most of the treatments so far have assumed arbitrary initial conditions just before the deceleration radius where most of the energy is transfered to the shocked external medium , which can result in some unrealistic outcomes  ( notable exceptions are paper i and * ? ? ?",
    "this work self - consistently considers the combined impulsive magnetic acceleration and deceleration by a unmagnetized external medium of an initially highly magnetized shell .",
    "the main results for the acceleration into vacuum of such a highly magnetized shell ( paper i ) are described in    [ sec : high - sigma - acc ] .",
    "the test case that was studied in detail in paper i features a magnetized shell initially at rest whose back end leans against a conducting wall with vacuum in front of it , with initial width @xmath7 , magnetic field @xmath8 , rest mass density @xmath9 and magnetization @xmath10 the shell is crossed by a strong , self - similar rarefaction wave essentially on its light crossing time so that at a radius @xmath11 it reaches a typical magnetization @xmath12 and lorentz factor @xmath13 .",
    "it then becomes super - fast - magnetosonic and looses causal contact with the wall , resulting in a much slower subsequent impulsive acceleration phase in which @xmath14 .",
    "eventually it becomes kinetically dominated at the coasting radius @xmath15 , and at larger radii it starts coasting at a constant lorentz factor ( @xmath16 ) and spreading radially while its magnetization rapidly drops with radius ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the combined acceleration and deceleration for an expansion into an unmagnetized external medium with a power - law density profile is addressed in detail in    [ sec : high - sigma - acc - dec ] . the test case from paper",
    "i is generalized by replacing the vacuum with an appropriate external medium .",
    "five distinct dynamical regimes are identified , and their main properties are derived and discussed . in regime",
    "i the external density is sufficiently low that early on it hardly affects the shell , which accelerates essentially as if into vacuum ( as described above ) until well after its coasting radius @xmath18 . by the time the effects of the external medium become important the magnetization is already low , so that regime i effectively reverts to the unmagnetized thin shell case ( where both the reverse shock emission and afterglow emission peak on a timescale longer than that of the prompt grb emission ) . in regime",
    "ii the external density is sufficiently large that it starts to strongly affect the shell during its impulsive acceleration phase , while it is still highly magnetized .",
    "the shell then starts to decelerate or accelerate more slowly until it transfers most of its energy to the shocked external medium . in regime",
    "ii the shell is highly magnetized all the way to its deceleration radius , and therefore this strongly suppresses the reverse shock ( which is either non - existent or very weak ) and its associated emission .",
    "thus , regime ii can be thought of as a highly magnetized thick shell case , in which no bright reverse shock emission is expected , and the afterglow emission peaks on a timescale comparable to that of the prompt grb . in regime iii the external density is high enough that from the very start it inhibits the acceleration so that there is no impulsive acceleration phase , and the dynamics become essentially independent of the flow composition ( i.e. of @xmath19 , while @xmath3 scales linearly with @xmath19 but affects only the small fraction of the total energy that is in kinetic form , @xmath20 ) .",
    "the observational signatures of regime iii are very similar to those of regime ii . in regime iv the external density is so high that the flow remains newtonian all along . this regime might be relevant for a highly magnetized jet trying to bore its way out of a massive star progenitor in long duration grbs . finally , regime ii@xmath21 occurs only for a highly stratified external medium for which it replaces regime ii , and where also regimes i and iii all show interesting and qualitatively different behavior compared to smaller stratifications .",
    "table  [ tab : notation ] summarizes the main notations and definitions that are used in this work in order to help the reader follow the text .",
    "the new results found in this work are compared to previous works in   [ sec : comp ] , and their implications are discussed in   [ sec : dis ] .",
    "before generalizing the dynamics to the case of a highly magnetized outflow , i begin with a detailed description of the deceleration of an unmagnetized shell ( corresponding to @xmath22 where @xmath3 is defined in the next section ) , that initially coasts and propagates relativistically into an unmagnetized external medium with a power law density profile .    for simplicity",
    "i assume spherical symmetry , and that the original ejecta from the grb form a uniform shell of initial lorentz factor @xmath23 and initial width @xmath24 , were a subscript ` 0 ' is used to denote the initial value of a quantity .",
    "bulk lorentz factors ( denoted by @xmath25 ) , as well as the radius @xmath26 and width @xmath27 of the shell are measured in the rest frame of the central source ( which is also the rest frame of the external medium , and thus serves as the lab frame ) , while thermodynamic quantities like the rest - mass density @xmath28 , the number density @xmath29 , the pressure @xmath30 , and the internal energy density @xmath31 are measured in the local rest frame of the fluid .",
    "a reasonable variation in @xmath23 of @xmath32 will result in a significant radial spreading of the shell from the spreading radius , @xmath33 , so that its ( lab - frame ) width evolves as @xmath34 .",
    "the ambient medium is assumed to have a power law mass density profile , @xmath35 , where for simplicity i consider only @xmath36 , which is also the parameter range of most physical interest .",
    "of particular interest are the cases @xmath37 , which corresponds to a constant density medium like the ism , and @xmath38 , which is expected for the stellar wind of a massive star progenitor .",
    "as the shell interacts with the external medium and sweeps it up , two shocks are formed : a forward shock that propagates into the ambient medium and a reverse shock that goes back into the shell and slows it down .",
    "the shocked shell material and the shocked external medium are separated by a contact discontinuity .",
    "there are thus four different regions :",
    "( 1 ) unperturbed external medium , ( 2 ) shocked external medium , ( 3 ) shocked shell material , and ( 4 ) unperturbed shell material .",
    "quantities at each region are denoted by the appropriate subscript @xmath39 .",
    "we have @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and since regions 2 and 3 are separated by a contact discontinuity , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . together with the shock jump conditions between regions 3 and 4 ( for the reverse shock ) and between regions 2 and 1 ( for the forward shock ) , the resulting set of equations ( together with the equations of state in the different regions ) can be solved to obtain @xmath25 , @xmath31 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( as well as the lorentz factors of the reverse and forward shock fronts ) as a function of @xmath23 and the density ratio @xmath46 of the unperturbed shell material and external medium .",
    "there are two limits for which there is a simple analytic solution @xcite : for @xmath47 the reverse shock is newtonian , and and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 @xmath50 , while for @xmath51 the reverse shock is relativistic , @xmath52 and the relative lorentz factor between the fluid in regions 4 and 3 is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 @xmath55erg is the ( isotropic equivalent ) kinetic energy of the ejecta shell , and @xmath56^{1/(3-k ) } = \\left\\{\\matrix{2.5\\times 10^{18}e_{53}^{1/3}n_0^{-1/3}\\;{\\rm cm }   & ( k=0)\\ , \\cr & \\cr 1.8\\times 10^{19}e_{53 } a_*^{-1}\\;{\\rm cm }   & ( k=2)\\ , } \\right.\\ ] ] is the sedov radius where the ( isotropic equivalent ) swept up mass equals @xmath57 .",

    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) that @xmath38 is a critical value below which @xmath63 decreases with radius and above which @xmath63 increases with radius , before the shell starts spreading ( i.e. while @xmath64 and is independent of radius ) .",

    "this happens since the shell pushes against itself and significantly expands in its own rest frame , under its own magnetic pressure ( while its width in the lab frame remains constant , @xmath201 , since its comoving width @xmath202 increases linearly with its lorentz factor @xmath25 as it accelerates ) .",
    "while in the comoving frame the expansion is roughly symmetric between the back and front parts of the shell , in the lab frame most of the energy remains in the front part of the the shell , resulting in a constant effective width ( @xmath203 , where most of the energy resides ) .",
    "the radial expansion of the shell in its own rest frame as its accelerates results in a dispersion @xmath204 in its lorentz factor .",
    "this causes the shell width in the lab frame to increase as @xmath205 .",
    "ideal mhd implies that the shell s electromagnetic energy scales as @xmath206 .",

    "@xcite has argued , however , that multiple sub - shells with an initial separation comparable to their initial width would collide and merge while still highly magnetized , which is incorrect and in contradiction with paper i. an accompanying paper  @xcite focuses on the possible role of multiple sub - shells , which can alleviate some of the requirements on the lorentz factor of the outflow and may help accommodate grb observations much better .",
    "this work has presented a detailed and unified treatment of the magnetic acceleration of an impulsive , initially highly magnetized ( @xmath182 ) shell and its deceleration by an unmagnetized external medium ( with a power - law density profile ) .",
    "the dynamics divide into three main regimes ( i , ii , and iii ) and two more `` exotic '' regimes ( relevant for an external density that either sharply drops with radius [ ii@xmath21 ] , or is very large [ iv ] , leading to a newtonian flow ) .",
    "in regime i the external density is low enough that the shell accelerates almost as if into vacuum . at the coasting radius , @xmath772 , it reaches its maximal lorentz factor of @xmath773 ( where @xmath353 is given in eq .",
    "[ [ eta_cr ] ] ) and becomes kinetic energy dominated . at @xmath689",
    "this regime reverts back to the well - studied unmagnetized `` thin shell '' case  @xcite , where the shell coasts and spreads radially , @xmath774 , as its magnetization rapidly decreases well below unity , @xmath775 . in this regime",
    "the reverse shock is initially newtonian , starts dominating the pressure behind the cd at @xmath776 , and becomes mildly relativistic when it finishes crossing the shell , at @xmath777 . the deceleration radius , @xmath360 , which corresponds to an observed deceleration time @xmath778 , is where most of the energy dissipation in the shell takes place and most of the energy is transfered to the shocked external medium .",
    "thus , both the reverse shock emission and the afterglow emission are expected to peak on the timescale of @xmath779 . at @xmath418 ( or @xmath780 ) the flow",
    "quickly approaches the bm76 self - similar solution , which for grbs signals the start of the usual long - lived decaying afterglow emission .",
    "the magnetization at the deceleration radius is low , @xmath781 .",
    "if it is very low then magnetic field amplification in the mildly relativistic collisionless ( reverse ) shock that develops could bring the downstream magnetic field to within a few percent of equipartition , thus allowing a good radiative efficiency for synchrotron emission , resulting in a bright reverse shock emission .",
    "in this regime the reverse shock emission and the afterglow emission both peak on a timescale @xmath782 that is larger than the duration @xmath783 of the prompt grb emission , @xmath784 . moreover , the degree of magnetization behind the reverse shock , @xmath785 , can be directly inferred from the ratio of these two observable times .    in regimes",
    "ii or iii the shell remains highly magnetized near the deceleration radius , @xmath786 , which strongly suppresses the reverse shock ( which either becomes very weak or non - existent ) and its associated emission .",
    "the energy in the flow is transfered to the shocked external medium ( mostly near @xmath787 ) with very little dissipation within the original shell as long as ideal mhd holds .",
    "this is a highly magnetized `` thick shell '' case , and the afterglow onset time is similar to the initial shell light crossing time , @xmath788 . for a single shell ejected from the source the prompt emission in this case might either arise from the onset of the forward shock emission ( for an external shock origin , which makes it difficult to account for significant variability , and in which case @xmath789 ) or alternatively due to magnetic reconnection events within the highly magnetized shell .",
    "the latter might be induced by the deceleration of the shell due to the external medium , in which case they might peak near @xmath568 , since the angular size of causally connected regions ( @xmath790 ) grows as the shell decelerates ( @xmath791 decreases with radius for @xmath66 ) and at @xmath792 most of the energy is still in the original magnetized shell ( this would again lead to @xmath793 ) .    for the single shell case that was analyzed in this work",
    "there is either the low magnetization `` thin shell '' ( regime i ) or the high magnetization `` thick shell '' ( regimes ii or iii ) .",
    "there is no low magnetization `` thick shell '' case where a strong highly relativistic reverse shock develops , which can result in a bright reverse shock emission on a timescale comparable to that of the prompt gamma - ray emission in grbs ( @xmath794 ) .",
    "similarly , there is no high magnetization `` thin shell '' case where the reverse shock is severely suppressed by a high magnetization in the shell near the deceleration radius and the afterglow onset occurs well after the prompt grb emission ( @xmath795 ) .",
    "therefore , a bright reverse shock emission is possible only in the low magnetization `` thin shell '' case ",
    "regime i , in which case this reverse shock emission ( as well as the afterglow emission ) would peak on a timescale larger than the duration of the prompt grb emission , @xmath796 .",
    "an accompanying paper  @xcite , however , shows that if the flow consists of many distinct sub - shells instead of a single shell , then this may also allow a low magnetization `` thick shell '' regime .",
    "the lorentz factor of the emitting region in grbs must be high enough to overcome the compactness problem and avoid excessive pair production within the source  @xcite .",
    "it had been recently argued  @xcite that the interaction with the external medium might not enable an impulsive highly magnetized outflow in grbs to accelerate up to sufficiently high lorentz factors , and that its maximal achievable lorentz factor is largely limited to @xmath797 .",
    "this would pose a particularly severe problem for a stellar wind - like external medium ( @xmath38 ) for which typically @xmath798 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eta_cr ] ] ) .",
    "recent high - energy observations by the fermi large area telescope ( lat ) have set a lower limit of @xmath799 for the emitting region in a number of grbs with a bright high - energy emission  @xcite using a simplified one - zone model .",
    "however , a more detailed and realistic treatment shows that the limit is lower by a factor of @xmath800  @xcite , which would correspond to @xmath801 for the brightest fermi lat grbs .",
    "nevertheless , this might still pose a problem for a single highly magnetized shell in a stellar - wind environment .",
    "regime i implies a maximal lorentz factor of the flow , @xmath802 ( where @xmath353 is given in eq .",
    "[ [ eta_cr ] ] ) .",
    "in regime ii , a higher maximal lorentz factor is possible for @xmath66 , and @xmath499 peaks at @xmath552 where it exceeds @xmath353 by a factor of @xmath803 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : gamma_u ] ] ) , while @xmath249 can reach values as high as @xmath804 at @xmath805 ( however , the material with such a lorentz factor would carry only a small fraction of the total energy , @xmath806 at @xmath807 ) . in regime",
    "iii the typical lorentz factor is close to that of the cd , @xmath808 , and for @xmath66 they both peak at @xmath440 where they exceed @xmath353 by a factor of @xmath809 , while @xmath810 at @xmath811 .",
    "all this could help increase @xmath210 above @xmath353 for @xmath66 .",
    "however , for a stellar wind - like ( or steeper ) external medium , @xmath61 ( or @xmath105 ) , we have @xmath812 , which makes it very difficult to satisfy the observational constraints on @xmath25 from pair opacity ( mentioned above ) , and to a lesser extent also those from the onset time of the afterglow emission  ( usually around a few hundred ; * ? ? ?",
