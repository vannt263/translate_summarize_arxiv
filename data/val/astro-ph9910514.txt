    "the rosat all - sky survey ( _ rass _ ) was the first all - sky survey in the soft x - ray range ( 0.07 kev to 2.4 kev ) with an imaging telescope ( aschenbach @xcite ) .",
    "it started on july 30 , 1990 , two months after the launch of the rosat x - ray satellite ( trmper @xcite ) on june 1 , 1990 . using the position sensitive proportional counter ( _ pspc _ ) rosat scanned the sky during the all - sky survey in great circles perpendicular to the direction of the sun , and thus covered the whole sky in half a year .",
    "the rass allowed for the first time to study unbiased , _ spatially complete _ samples of x - ray sources .",

    "it is usually not possible to determine the physical nature of the x - ray source . in order to do so , optical follow - up observations have to be carried out . since during the rass",
    "about 60000 sources were detected ( voges et al .",

    "( @xcite ) , hereafter paperii . as described in paperii , in order to reduce the sample to a manageable but still statistically significant size , we chose minimum count rates of 0.03 cts s@xmath10 for five of our areas and 0.01 cts s@xmath10 for one area .",

    "this obviously reflects the fact that emission lines in the optical spectrum indicate strong stellar activity which tends to give rise to x - ray emission .",
    "the frequency of ke stars may have been underestimated , since at our low spectral resolution weak emission lines could not always be detected .    in order to check whether some of our stellar identifications could be due to a random positional coincidence with field stars , we calculated the number of stars @xmath11 expected for the total area of our 674 error circles ( 0.147 deg@xmath12 ) . for our calculations we used the luminosity function by spectral type presented in table 4 - 7 by mihalas & binney ( @xcite ) . for the scale heights in @xmath13 direction we used the numbers given in table 4 - 16 by mihalas and binney .",
    "the numbers for @xmath11 were calculated for galactic latitude @xmath14 of 45 degrees .",
    "interstellar extinction was not taken into account .",
    "for both f and m stars random positional coincidences do not play any significant role . for f stars",
    "brighter than our detection limit of @xmath15 14 mag we expect 0.8 stars in the total area of our error circles , for m stars brighter than the limit of @xmath16 = 15 mag we expect 0.3 stars , respectively .",
    "the situation is different , however , for g and k stars . here",
    "we expect for stars down to a brightness limit of @xmath16 = 15 mag some 7.6 and 6.6 stars , respectively , in the total area of our error circles . for a brightness limit of 13",
    "we expect for the g stars still 3.4 stars in the error circles , whereas for the k star the expectation value of 0.8 stars drops below one .",
    "the expectation value of one star per error circle area is reached for g stars at @xmath15 12 mag .",
    "these results show that the number of dwarf stars randomly present in the total area of our error circles should be of the order of @xmath1715 sources .",
    "however , the actual number of g stars fainter than 12th magnitude and k stars fainter than 13th magnitude incorrectly identified as x - ray sources due to a random positional coincidence , should be much lower .",
    "firstly , as all g and k stars emit x - rays at some level , it is unlikely that all the stars in the error circles are unrelated to the observed x - ray flux .",
    "secondly , as most error circles contain another plausible optical counterpart ( such as an agn ) , the majority of the randomly present dwarf stars are expected to appear as the less probable component in multiple sources .",
    "( there are nine multiple sources , where we considered a faint g or k star to be the less likely counterpart ) .",
    "thirdly , a source with , for instance , a bright agn and a faint dwarf star normally has not been classified as multiple source . therefore , even with most pessimistic assumptions a random positional coincidence should not have resulted in more than about two to three g and the same number of k stars incorrectly identified as optical counterparts of the observed x - ray sources .",
    "these numbers are significantly smaller than the @xmath18 statistical uncertainties of our results for these stars and , therefore , do not affect our statistical conclusions .",
    "our resolution was , unfortunately , not sufficient , to detect the lithium @xmath196707 absorption line which would be an indicator for a relatively young age of the star . in a follow - up study of the present identification project , zickgraf et al .",
    "@xcite found among 35 k and m stars of field i nine stars which display significant li @xmath196707 absorption .",
    "first results of a detailed study of field vi by zickgraf et al .",
    "( in preparation ) indicate that here the fraction of li stars among the k stars is lower than in field i.    we note that three a stars ( two a2 , one a5 ) were found in our sample .",
    "this is unexpected , since , according to theoretical predictions , early to mid a stars should not show any x - ray emission because of the missing convection zone ( e.g. haisch & schmitt @xcite ) . in most cases , where x - ray emission seemed to be present in a stars , it was found to originate from a cool companion .      as can be seen from table 3 , there are in part distinct differences between the individual fields . while in field i the stellar counterparts outnumber the agn by a factor of 3.5 , there are 5 times more agn than stars in field iv .",
    "these differences are of high statistical significance . the main reason for this differing ratios are different mean hydrogen column densities @xmath2 . in field",
    "i @xmath20@xmath21 is more than seven times higher than in field iv ( 1.6@xmath22@xmath23 ) .",
    "the main reason for this strongly differing hydrogen column density is the location at different galactic latitudes @xmath24 . while field i is at an intermediate galactic latitude @xmath25 , field iv is close to the north galactic pole ( mean latitude @xmath26 .    in fields",
    "ii , iii , v , and vi the ratios n@xmath27/n@xmath28 are between 0.79 ( field v ) and 1.33 ( field ii ) . in fields iii and vi about the same numbers of stars and agn have been identified .",
    "these four fields have - with @xmath29 values between 3.9@xmath22 and 5.5@xmath22@xmath23 - intermediate mean hydrogen column densities . for these fields",
    "no correlation between the ratio of stars and agn with @xmath29 could be found .      with our complete sample",
    "it is possible to derive final values for the positional uncertainty of rass x - ray sources , i.e. , the mean distance of the identified optical sources from the x - ray positions .",
    "we follow the same procedure as outlined in section 5.2 of paperii .",
    "figure [ jk8432.f1 ] shows the positional uncertainties in right ascension ( solid line ) and in declination ( dashed line ) of our sources .",
    "1@xmath30 , ( i.e. the 67% error circle ) corresponds to 13.5  for right ascension and 12.8  for declination , i.e. about the same for each coordinate .",
    "the sytematic offset towards the east due to the motion of the satellite during read - out of the data is 1.5 .",
    "the standard deviation found here is about 4  larger than in the preliminary data presented in paperii .    for the total distance between the optical source and the x - ray position",
    "we derive a 1@xmath30 standard deviation of 17  and a 90% error circle of 30 .",
    "these numbers are significantly smaller than those calculated by the sass ( standard analysis software system ) where a 90% error circle of 40 - 45  was derived ( voges et al .",
    ", in preparation ) and also smaller than the 50  90% confidence radii from the emss ( stocke et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "because of the smaller area of the error circle of the rass as compared to the emss , confusion of x - ray sources should be lower in the rass than in the emss .",
    "stocke et al .",
    "( @xcite ) found for their emss a source confusion level of the order of 2.5% ( 21 out of 835 sources ) . since the sensitivity levels of the rass and the emss are not too different , we conclude that source confusion in our flux limited rass sample should be well below 1% .",
    "tables 4 and 5 show mean hardness ratios of our samples .",
    "( for the definition of the hardness ratios see e.g. paperii ) . for the calculation of the mean values only hardness ratios with internal errors @xmath31 have been used .",
    "in addition , all hardness ratios below -1.0 and above + 1.0 were set to -1.0 and + 1.0 , respectively . values of @xmath32 are purely artificial without physical meaning .",
    "they arise from the fact that for very soft or and for very hard sources the x - ray flux in the hard or soft range , respectively , is below the detection limit .",
    "so fluctuations in the background subtraction can give ( physically meaningless ) negative values in these bands .",
    "for the individual study areas mean hardness ratios have been calculated for stars and agn only .",
    "for the three other groups , galaxies , cluster of galaxies , and sources with no optical identification ( which are included for completeness reasons ) the number of objects in the individual fields is too low to get any significant results .    as tables 4 and 5 show , for the mean values of hr2 , which subdivides the hard range , there are only marginal differences between the individual classes of objects .",
    "this applies to both the total sample and to the individual fields . even in the case of strongly differing @xmath33hr1@xmath34 values",
    "are found ( like for the agn in fields i and iv , + 0.83 vs. -0.12 ) , the @xmath33hr2@xmath34 values are essentially the same .",
    "there is a trend that galaxies and clusters of galaxies seem to have somewhat higher @xmath33hr2@xmath34 values than stars .    for @xmath33hr1@xmath34",
    "more pronounced differences are found between the individual classes of objects .",
    "stars have on the average the lowest hr1 , i.e. , they have the softest spectral energy distributions ( sed ) .",
    "this holds even , if one removes the white dwarfs and the emission line stars ( cf .",
    "paperiii ) from the sample , since @xmath33hr1@xmath34 changes from + 0.11 to + 0.12 only .",
    "agn display on the average ( @xmath33hr1@xmath34=+0.35 ) a somewhat harder sed than stars .",
    "a significantly harder sed is found for clusters of galaxies with @xmath33hr1@xmath34=+0.65@xmath350.26 .",
    "this is indeed what is expected for this class of objects which exhibit a rather hard intrinsic spectrum caused by thermal bremsstrahlung from a hot ( 10@xmath36 - 10@xmath37 k ) plasma ( cf .",

    "likewise , both radio - loud and x - ray - bright agn are well separated in the upper left corner of the diagram .",
    "the results of a complete optical identification of a spatially complete , count rate limited of rosat all - sky survey x - ray sources show that the rass is dominated by stellar sources and agn .",
    "while nearly the same fraction of stars and agn ( 40.7% and 42.1% , respectively ) are found in our total sample which comprises six individual fields outside the galactic plane , distinct variations are found between the individual fields .",
