    "finding clues for the nature of dark matter in the universe is one of the most pressing issues in the interface between particle physics and cosmology . in this talk",
    "we briefly review some work we have done [ @xcite ] in the direction of finding a suitable , particle physics motivated , candidate that could solve some of the recent problems with the usual cold dark matter scenario .    the cold dark matter model ( cdm ) supplemented by a cosmological constant sucessfully explains , in the context of inflationary models , the observed structure of the universe on large scales , the cosmic microwave background anisotropies and type ia supernovae observations [ @xcite ] for a given set of density parameters , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "according to this scenario , initial gaussian density fluctuations , mostly in non - relativistic collisionless particles , the so - called cold dark matter , are generated in an inflationary period of the universe .",
    "these fluctuations grow gravitationally forming dark halos into which luminous matter is eventually condensed and cooled .",
    "however , despite its successes , there is a growing wealth of recent observational data that raise problems in the cdm scenarios .",
    "n - body simulations predict a number of halos which is a factor @xmath3 10 larger than the observed number at the level of local group [ @xcite ] .",
    "furthermore , cdm models yield dispersion velocities in the hubble flow within a sphere of @xmath4mpc between @xmath5kms@xmath6 for @xmath7 and between @xmath8kms@xmath6 for @xmath0 .",
    "the observed value is about @xmath9kms@xmath6 .",
    "neither model can produce a single local group candidate with the observed velocity dispersion in a simulation box of comoving volume @xmath10 [ @xcite ] .",
    "a related issue is that astrophysical systems which are dm dominated like dwarf galaxies [ @xcite ] , low surface brightness galaxies [ @xcite ] and galaxy clusters without a central cd galaxy [ @xcite ] show shallow matter",
    " density profiles which can be modeled by isothermal spheres with finite central densities .",
    "this is in contrast with galactic and galaxy cluster halos in high resolution n - body simulations [ @xcite ] which have singular cores , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the range between 1 and 2 . indeed",
    ", cold collisionless dm particles do not have any associated length scale leading , due to hierarchical gravitational collapse , to dense dark matter halos with negligible core radius [ @xcite ] .    a possible solution , coming from particle physics",
    ", would be to allow dm particles to self - interact so that they have a large scattering cross section and negligible annihilation or dissipation .",
    "self - interaction induces a characteristic length scale via the mean free path of the particle in the halo .",
    "this idea has been originally proposed to suppress small scale power in the standard cdm model [ @xcite ] and has been recently revived in order to address the issues discussed above [ @xcite ] .",
    "the main feature of self - interacting dark matter ( sidm ) is that large self - interacting cross sections lead to a short mean free path , so that dark matter particles with mean free path of the order of the scale length of halos allows for the transfer of conductive heat to the halo cores , a quite desirable feature [ @xcite ] .",
    "recently performed numerical simulations indicate that strongly self - interacting dark matter does indeed lead to better predictions concerning satellite galaxies [ @xcite ] . however , only in presence of weak self - interaction [ @xcite ] the core problem might be solved .",
    "the two - body cross section is estimated to be in the range of @xmath13 @xmath14/gev , from a variety of arguments , such as the requirement of a mean free path between 1 and 1000 kpc [ @xcite ] , the core expansion time scale to be smaller than the halo age [ @xcite ] and analysis of cluster ellipticity [ @xcite ] .",
    "larger value of @xmath15 @xmath14/gev corresponds to the best fit to the rotation curve of a low surface brightness in simulations [ @xcite ] . in our work , we assume for definiteness that the the cross section is fixed via the requirement that the mean free path of the particle in the halo is in the range @xmath16 kpc .",
    "many models of physics beyond the standard model suggest the existence of new scalar gauge singlets , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the so - called next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model [ @xcite ] . in this section ,",
    "we provide a simple example for the realization of the idea proposed in [ @xcite ] of a self - interacting , non - dissipative cold dark matter candidate that is based on an extra gauge singlet , @xmath17 , coupled to the standard model higgs boson , @xmath18 , with a lagrangian density given by :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the field @xmath17 self - coupling constant , @xmath21 is its mass , @xmath22 gev is the higgs vacuum expectation value and @xmath23 is the coupling between the singlet @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we assume that the @xmath17 mass does not arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking since tight constraints from non - newtonian forces eliminates this possibility due to the fact that , in this case , there is a relation among coupling constant , mass and vacuum expectation value that leads to a tiny scalar self - coupling constant . in its essential",
    "features our self - interacting dark matter model can be regarded as a concrete realization of the generic massive scalar field with quartic potential discussed in [ @xcite ] .",
    "we mention that a model with features similar to ours has been discussed long ago in [ @xcite ] .",
    "we shall assume that @xmath17 interacts only with @xmath18 and with itself .",
    "it is completely decoupled for @xmath24 . for reasonable values of @xmath23 , this new scalar would introduce a new , invisible decay mode for the higgs boson .",
    "this could be an important loophole in the current attemps to find the higgs boson at accelerators [ @xcite ] . this coupling could , in principle , be relevant for @xmath25 scattering but we shall be conservative and assume that it is small and neglect its contribution .",
    "these particles are non - relativistic , with typical velocities of @xmath26 km @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , there is no dissipation of energy by , for instance , creating more particles in reactions like @xmath28 .",
    "only the elastic channel is kinetically accessible and the scattering matrix element near threshold ( @xmath29 ) is given by : @xmath30 near threshold the cross section is given roughly by : @xmath31    we shall derive limits on @xmath21 and @xmath20 by demanding that the mean free path of the particle @xmath17 , @xmath32 , should be in the interval @xmath33mpc .",
    "this comes about because , if the mean free path were much greater than about @xmath34mpc , dark matter particles would not experience any interaction as they fly through a halo . on the other hand ,",
    "if the dark matter mean free path were much smaller than @xmath34kpc , dark matter particles would behave as a collisional gas altering substantially the halo structure and evolution .",
    "hence , we have : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the number and mass density in the halo of the @xmath17 particle , respectively . using @xmath38 gev/@xmath39 ,",
    "corresponding to the halo density , one finds : @xmath40 equating eqs .",
    "( [ cross1 ] ) and ( [ cross2 ] ) we obtain : @xmath41    demanding the mean free path of the @xmath17 particle to be of order of 1 mpc implies in the _ model independent _ result : @xmath42    recently , it has been argued , on the basis of gravitational lensing analysis , that the shape of the ms2137 - 23 system is elliptical while self - interacting non - dissipative cdm implies that halos are spherical [ @xcite ] . furthermore , the limit    @xmath43    arises from that analysis , which is about an order of magnitude smaller than ( [ sstein ] ) .",
    "indeed , gravitational lensing arguments are acknowledged to be crucial in validating sidm ; however , estimates made in [ @xcite ] were criticized as they rely on a single system and because their intrinsic uncertainties actually allow for consistency with sidm [ @xcite ] .    in order to estimate the amount of @xmath17 particles that were produced in the early universe and survived until present , we assume that @xmath17 particles were mainly produced during reheating after the end of inflation . a natural setting to consider this issue is within the framework of @xmath44 supergravity inspired inflationary models , where the inflaton sector couples with the gauge sector only through the gravitational interaction . hence , the number of @xmath17 particles expressed in terms of the ratio @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the photonic entropy density , is related with the inflaton ( @xmath47 ) abundance after its decay by    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the number of degrees of freedom . notice that @xmath50 is a conserved quantity since @xmath17 does not couple to fermions . in the context of @xmath44 supergravity inflationary models , the upper bound on the reheating temperature in order to avoid the gravitino problem ( see [ @xcite ] and references therein ) , @xmath51 is given by the ratio of the reheating temperature and the inflaton mass and , for typical models    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is an order one constant .",
    "this estimate allows us to compute the energy density contribution of @xmath17 particles in terms of the baryonic density parameter :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the baryon asymmetry of the universe .    using eq .",
    "( [ mass ] ) and taking @xmath56 , we obtain :    @xmath57    which allows identifying @xmath17 as the cosmological dark matter candidate , i.e. @xmath58 [ @xcite ] , for @xmath59 , @xmath20 of order one and @xmath60 of about @xmath34mpc .",
    "we have also found that the @xmath17 particle do not generate dangerous non - newtonian forces [ @xcite ] .",
    "in this work [ @xcite ] , we suggest that a scalar gauge singlet coupled with the higgs field in such a way as to give origin to an invisible higgs is a suitable candidate for self - interacting dark matter .",
    "this proposal has some quite distinct features .",
    "firstly , since gauge invariance prevents the scalar singlet to couple to fermions , hence strategies for directly searching this dark matter candidate must necessarily concentrate on the hunt of the higgs field itself in accelerators .",
    "furthermore , in what concerns its astrophysical and cosmological implications , the main aspects of our proposal are quite unambiguously expressed by eqs .",
    "( [ cross2 ] ) , ( [ mass ] ) and ( [ finaldensity ] ) .",
    "confronting the result of simulations with our candidate for different values of the relevant parameters with observations may turn out to be crucial for validating our proposal .",
    "we would like to add that a recent detailed study of our simple model [ @xcite ] has shown that our abundance computation is valid only if the higgs field is very weakly coupled to the scalar gauge singlet ( @xmath61 ) , since otherwise the scalar field will reach thermal equilibrium [ @xcite ] .",
    "the study of phion annihilation processes via exchange of virtual higgs particles indicates that in order to achieve @xmath62 requires @xmath63 [ @xcite ] which leads to a higgs decay width that is distinctly different than the standard model one .",
