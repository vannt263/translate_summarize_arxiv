    "the periodic multilayer is regarded as an anisotropic homogeneous medium with effective relative permittivity tensor @xmath15 , where the relative effective _ transverse _",
    "permittivity @xmath16 is found by averaging the transverse _ effective _ displacement current over the associated electric field in a unit cell ( here , the effective displacement current is defined as a quantity that includes both displacement current in the dielectric slab and conduction current in the infinitesimally - thin graphene sheet ) .",
    "then the relative effective permittivity parameter for transversely polarized field is    @xmath17    graphene - dielectric multilayer hm topology , modeled by a periodically - loaded transmission line .",
    "the unit cell is indicated on the right and the graphene sheet is represented as a shunt admittad mid - infrared frequencies , tm@xmath18 waves exhibit hyperbolic isofrequency wavevector dispersion . ]    since an individual graphene sheet is infinitesimally - thin , the conduction current is always along the sheet , hence the permittivity experienced by @xmath19directed electric field is not affected by graphene , leading to @xmath20 the relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq__1 ] ) implies that when the graphene sheet is adequately inductive , in particular when @xmath21 , we obtain @xmath22 and in turn the isofrequency wavevector dispersion is hyperbolic @xcite , as demonstrated next .",
    "let us consider plane waves propagating inside the metamaterial with the spatial dependence @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the wavevector .",
    "a plane wave analysis is particularly useful in understanding the multilayer s response to sources because the radiation of a dipole inside or close to the metamaterial can be represented as a spatial spectral sum of plane waves . due to the symmetry of the multilayer metamaterial with respect to the @xmath25 axis , we will use @xmath26 for denoting the transverse wavenumber component and in the following @xmath27 is taken real representing the spatial spectrum of te@xmath18 ( electric field transverse to @xmath25 ) and tm@xmath18 ( magnetic field transverse to @xmath25 ) waves .",
    "the @xmath25-directed wavenumber @xmath28 can assume complex values modeling propagation and attenuation , accounting also for natural losses in the material constituents .",
    "accordingly , the wavevector dispersion of te@xmath18 and tm@xmath18 waves inside the effective medium is given as    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the wavenumber in free space . when the losses are neglected ( i.e. , if @xmath31 ) one would obtain purely real @xmath16 , hence @xmath32 ( obtained via eq.([eq3_tekz ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq4_tmkz ] ) ) assumes either purely real values , denoting the propagating spectrum , or purely imaginary values , denoting the evanescent spectrum . in this lossless case ,",
    "hyperbolic dispersion occurs when @xmath33 , and the hm uniaxial medium allows for propagation ( i.e. , @xmath32 is purely real ) of extraordinary waves ( tm@xmath18 ) with a large transverse wavenumber @xmath34 ; these waves with @xmath34 would be otherwise evanescent ( i.e. , @xmath32 is purely imaginary ) either in a isotropic dielectric with permittivity @xmath14 , or in a generic uniaxial anisotropic media with @xmath35 .",
    "this unusual phenomenon implies that high @xmath36 spectrum emanating from sources , which would be evanescent in free space , can be converted to propagating waves at hm interfaces .",
    "ordinary waves ( te@xmath18 ) are , however , evanescent for any @xmath36 when @xmath33 . on the other hand , when @xmath35 we have real @xmath32 only for limited spectrum of tm@xmath18 waves with @xmath37 , which leads to the elliptic isofrequency wavevector dispersion .",
    "therefore the transition between hyperbolic to elliptic regimes is associated to the condition @xmath38 .    instead , for realistic lossy cases",
    ", @xmath32 is complex and the wavevector isofrequency dispersion becomes elliptic - like and hyperbolic - like ( for @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively ) , as shown in the examples in next section .",
    "however , the interpretations regarding propagation of power are still valid provided that losses are relatively small , and we will show that moderate propagation losses is a major advantage of graphene - based hms at far- and mid - infrared frequencies . when applying ema , the dispersion relation @xmath41 is hyperbolic - like for @xmath34 when @xmath22 , and it converges to the asymptote @xmath42 for large spatial wavenumber @xmath27 , i.e. , the @xmath41 dispersion becomes linear , with a slope of @xmath43 .",
    "to validate our ema hypothesis , we obtain a more accurate representation of the wavevector dispersion relation by employing bloch theory @xcite for a periodically loaded transmission line whose unit cell is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig__1 ] .",
    "when each graphene sheet is modeled with a complex admittance @xmath44 , the dispersion relation for tm@xmath18 or te@xmath18 waves in the periodic structure is cast in the form    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the @xmath25-directed wavenumber of a wave inside the dielectric spacer , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the characteristic wave impedances for tm@xmath18 and te@xmath18 waves , respectively .",
    "this relation in ( [ eq_3_bloch-1 ] ) is yet accurate for arbitrary @xmath13 and @xmath27 , i.e. , accounts for transverse wavenumber dispersion . for the spectrum",
    "in which the dielectric layer s thickness is much smaller than the bloch wavelength and the wavelength inside the dielectric itself ( @xmath49 ) , we can apply the following small argument approximations @xmath50 and @xmath51 , the dispersion relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq_3_bloch-1 ] ) simplifies to the one obtained via ema in eq .",
    "( [ eq3_tekz ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq4_tmkz ] ) using the same definitions for @xmath16 and @xmath52 @xcite . as we will discuss thoroughly in sec . 3",
    ", bloch theory proves that the propagating spectrum of tm@xmath18 waves is limited due to the periodicity , manifested by the brillouin zone edge at which @xmath53=@xmath54 , and therefore the propagating spectrum in realistic hms has an upper bound even in lossless cases .",
    "nevertheless , the brillouin zone edge ( i.e. , @xmath53=@xmath54 ) is reached in general at higher values of @xmath55 provided that the period @xmath13 is extremely subwavelength .    in the following",
    "we report some aspects that demonstrate the merits of graphene - based hm : graphene conductivity @xmath2 is tunable with chemical potential variation via electrostatic biasing , hence @xmath56 is also tunable through negative or positive values , at a fixed frequency .",
    "this implies a possible transition between hyperbolic to elliptic wavevector dispersion .",
    "the realization of hms using graphene is also prone to graphene s frequency response .",
    "for instance , graphene sheets are mainly capacitive in mid- and near - infrared frequencies , because intraband contributions in graphene are dominant , and the @xmath57 surface modes on a single graphene sheet become on the improper riemann sheet @xcite . on the other hand , at very low frequencies ( ghz regime ) , the interband conductivity dominates leading to high losses . hence a proper frequency range for realizing hyperbolic dispersion extends from far - infrared up to low mid - infrared frequencies",
    "furthermore , the dielectric thickness also plays role on the frequency range of hm design . as the dielectric thickness",
    "is increased , the frequency range of negative @xmath56 shifts to lower frequencies which are undesirable due to significant losses in graphene . moreover , thicker spacers require a larger biasing electrostatic potential between layers to achieve a moderate chemical potential level in graphene sheets . on the other hand , when considering smaller periods ( in the range of several nanometers ) , it is expected that graphene sheets are no longer electronically isolated for such quantum - scale interspacing , and a tight binding model for graphene layers must be taken into account in order to evaluate the conductivity of graphene sheets @xcite .",
    "therefore , for very small thicknesses , both ema relation , reported in ( [ eq4_tmkz ] ) , and transfer matrix analysis must be modified to account for quantum tunneling between graphene sheets . in the next section",
    "we will explore and provide illustrative examples for graphene - based hm designs in terms of frequency response , losses and tunability and we will assess the validity of the ema in predicting hyperbolic or elliptic dispersion regimes .",
