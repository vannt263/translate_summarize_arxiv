    "the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation methods are nonperturbative tools of the statistical physics developed hand in hand with increasing power of nowadays computers .",
    "the benchmark for testing of mc algorithms represents the exactly solvable ising spin model @xcite . between algorithms",
    "applied to different variants of this model , the using of the single - spin - flip metropolis algorithm @xcite prevails due to its simplicity .",
    "nevertheless the principal problems have emerged as a consequence of the accuracy and efficiency demands especially for the critical region .    as a consequence of this several methods enhancing mc efficiency",
    "have been considered .",
    "the procedures of great significance are : finite - size - scaling relations and renormalization group based algorithms @xcite - @xcite , cluster algorithms @xcite lowering the critical slowing down , histogram and reweighting techniques @xcite interpolating the stochastic data , and multicanonical ensemble methods @xcite overcoming the tunneling between coexisting phases at 1st order transitions . even with the mentioned modifications and related mc versions , a laborious and human assisted work is needed until a satisfactory accuracy of results is achieved .",
    "this is trivial reason why utilization of the self - organization principles have attracted recent attention of mc community .    in the present paper we deal with the combining of the self - organization principles and mc dynamics",
    "of course , this effort has a computational rather than physical impact .",
    "our former aim was to design the temperature scan seeking for the position of the critical points of the lattice spin systems .",
    "but this original aim has been later affected by the general empirical idea of the self - organized criticality ( soc )  @xcite , originally proposed as a unifying theoretical framework describing a vast class of systems evolving spontaneously to the critical state .",
    "the soc examples are sand pile , forest - fire @xcite and game - of - life @xcite models .",
    "the soc property can be defined through the scale - invariance of the steady state asymptotics reached by the _ probability density functions _",
    "( pdf s ) constructed for spatial and temporal measures of dissipation events called _ avalanches_. the dynamics of standard soc systems is governed by the specific nonequilibrium critical exponents linked by the scaling relations @xcite in analogy to standard phase transitions .",
    "notice that dynamical rules of standard soc systems are functions of the microscopic parameters uncoupled to the global control parameters . on the contrary , in the spin systems governed by the single - spin - flip metropolis dynamics",
    ", the spins are flipped according to prescriptions depending on their neighbors , but also on the global or external control parameters , like temperature or selected parameters of the hamiltonian .",
    "the modification , by which the mc spin dynamics should be affected to mimic the soc properties , is discussed in @xcite . in agreement with @xcite ,",
    "any such modification needs the support of nonlinear feedback mechanism ensuring the critical steady stochastic state .",
    "it is clear that the feedback should be defined in terms of mc instant estimates of the statistical averages admitting the definition of critical state .",
    "the real feedback model called _ probability - changing cluster algorithm _ @xcite was appeared without any reference to the general soc paradigm .",
    "the alternative model was presented in @xcite , where temperature of the ferromagnet ising spin system was driven according to recursive formula corresponding to general statistical theory @xcite .",
    "this example was based on the mean magnetization leading to series of the temperature moves approaching the magnetic transition . despite the success in the optimized localization of critical temperature of the ising ferromagnet ,",
    "the using of term soc seems to be not adequate for this case .",
    "the reason is the absence of the analysis of spatio - temporal aspects of mc dynamics , which can be considered as a _ noncanonical equilibrium _",
    "@xcite , due to residual autocorrelation of the sequential mc sweeps .    regarding the above mentioned approaches , the principal question arises , if the mc supplemented by feedback , resembles or really pertains to branch of the standard soc models which are well - known from the bak s original paper @xcite and related works .",
    "the plan of our paper is the following .",
    "sec.2 is intended to generalization of the averaging relevant for the implementation of the self - organization principles .",
    "the details of feedback construction based on the temperature gradient of specific heat are discussed in sec.3 .",
    "these proposals are supplemented by the simulation results carried out for 2d ising ferromagnet .",
    "the details of the multi - lattice self - organized mc simulations , stabilizing true critical temperature via fourth - order magnetization cumulants , are presented in sec.4 .",
    "the oversimplified mean - field model of self - organized mc algorithm is discussed in sec.5 .",
    "several universal aspects of the self - organized mc dynamics are outlined by replica simulations in sec.6 .",
    "finally , the conclusions are presented .",
    "as we already mentioned in introduction , the mechanism by which many body system is attracted to the critical ( or pseudocritical ) point should be mediated by the feedback depending on the instantaneous estimates of the statistical averages . in this section",
    "we introduce the running averages important to construct the proper feedback rules .",
    "consider the mc simulation generating the sequence of configurations @xmath0 according to importance sampling update prescription of metropolis @xcite producing the canonical equilibrium boltzmann distribution as a function of the constant temperature @xmath1 .",
    "the estimate of the canonical average @xmath2 of some quantity @xmath3 @xmath4 can simply calculated from the series of @xmath5 sampled real values @xmath6 reweighted by @xmath7 ensuring the trivial normalization @xmath8 the summation given by eq.([eqeta ] ) is equivalent to recurrence @xmath9 showing how the average changes due to terminal contribution @xmath10 .",
    "consider the generalized averaging , where @xmath7 is replaced by the constant parameter @xmath11 which is independent of @xmath5 : @xmath12 the consequence of setting @xmath13 is the convolution @xmath14 defined by the modified weights @xmath15 which undergo to normalization @xmath16 for finite initial choice @xmath17 it yields @xmath18 where @xmath19 if the time of averaging is sufficiently large @xmath20 .",
    "it should be remarked that the generalized averages labeled by @xmath21 are equivalent to gamma filtered @xcite fluctuating inputs @xmath10 .",
    "note that the term _ gamma _ originated from the analytic form of the weight @xmath22 .",
    "the filtering represents the application of the selection principle suppressing the information older than the memory depth @xmath23 .",
    "to attain the critical region self - adaptively we construct the temperature dependent feedback changing the temperature in a way enhancing extremal fluctuations .",
    "the running estimates of averages are necessary to predict ( with share of the uncertainty ) the actual system position and the course in the phase diagram leading to critical point .",
    "the pseudocritical temperature @xmath24 of some finite system consisting of @xmath25 degrees of freedom is defined by the maximum @xmath26 of the specific heat @xmath27 . to form an attractor nearly @xmath24",
    ", we propose the following dynamics of the temperature random walker @xmath28 biased by the gradient @xmath29 where @xmath30 is mc estimate of the specific heat . from that",
    "follows that the energy fluctuations are controlled by the temperature representing the additional slowly varying degree of freedom .",
    "it is assumed here and in further that @xmath31 remains constant during @xmath25 random microscopic moves ( @xmath32mc step per @xmath25 ) .",
    "the sign function occurring in eq.([eqfc ] ) is used to suppress the extremal fluctuations of @xmath33 causing the unstable boundless behavior of @xmath31 . from several preliminary simulations",
    "it can be concluded that the replacement of sign function by some smooth differentiable function ( e.g. tangent hyperbolic or arcus tangent ) seems to be irrelevant for keeping of smaller dispersion of @xmath31 .",
    "the non - constant temperature steps are constrained by @xmath34 due to action of the pseudorandom numbers @xmath35 drawn from the uniform distribution within the interval @xmath36 .    very important for further purposes is the quasi - equilibrium approximation @xmath37 justified under the restrictions @xmath38 , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the equilibration time of @xmath3 .",
    "with help of this approximation , the running averages from eq.([eq31 ] ) can be generalized using @xmath41 which allow the averaging under the slowly varying temperature . here",
    "@xmath31 is the temperature for which the last sample @xmath42 is calculated .    for later purposes we also introduce the zero _ passage time _",
    "@xmath43 pertaining to @xmath3 . the time is defined as a measure of the stage during which the @xmath44 is invariant . more formal definition of @xmath45 requires the introducing of two auxiliary times @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "the first time @xmath46 defines the instant , where @xmath48 whereas @xmath47 counts the events for which @xmath49 the counting is finished for @xmath50 if @xmath51 to be thorough , the conditions @xmath52 , @xmath53 should be assumed for definition of @xmath54 .",
    "thus , using eqs.([signftc1])-([signftc3 ] ) the original sequence @xmath55 can be transformed to the sequence of passage times @xmath56 .    from the above definition",
    "it follows that random walk in temperature is unidirectional ( the sign of @xmath57 is ensured ) for @xmath58 .",
    "the arithmetic average of @xmath59 is related to temperature dispersion @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is calculated from @xmath62 .",
    "the standard formula providing @xmath63 is the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( in @xmath64 units ) @xmath65 here the specific heat is expressed in terms of the energy @xmath66 cumulants @xmath67 , @xmath68 . in the frame of the quasi - static approximation it is assumed : @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "subsequently , using properties of energy cumulants with equilibrium boltzmann weights , the temperature derivative of @xmath30 can be approximated by @xmath72    the ising ferromagnet is simulated in further to study the effect of feedback defined by eqs.([eqfc ] ) , ( [ gradc1 ] ) and ( [ dcdt1 ] ) .",
    "however , it is worthwhile to note that many of the presented results are of general relevance . given the spin system @xmath73 , @xmath74 placed at @xmath75 sites of the square @xmath76 lattice with the periodic boundary conditions , the ising hamiltonian can be defined in exchange coupling units @xmath77 where nn means that summation running over the spin nearest neighbors .    in general , the dynamics of soc systems exhibits two distinct regimes . during the _ transient _ regime the proximity of critical or pseudocritical point is reached .",
    "the second steady regime is called here the noncanonical equilibrium in analogy with @xcite . in this regime",
    "the attraction to critical point is affected by the critical noise .",
    "this general classification is confirmed by our results shown in figs.[fig1]-[fig3 ] . in fig.[fig1 ] we see the stochastic paths of @xmath31 pertaining to different initial values of energy cumulants and spin configurations .",
    "the paths are attracted by @xmath24 with some uncertainty in noncanonical equilibrium . for the sufficiently narrow steady pdf s",
    ", @xmath24 can be approximated by @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the number of inputs .",
    "the stationary pdf of @xmath31 walk is shown in fig.[fig2]a and pdf of @xmath33 with non - gaussian flat tails is depicted in fig.[fig2]b .",
    "the alternative quantity capable for the characterization of the noncanonical equilibrium is the autocorrelation @xmath80 the simulations results depicted in fig.[fig3]a evidenced that minimum time for which the anticorrelation ( @xmath81 ) occur is of the order @xmath82 .",
    "as we see from fig.[fig3]b , the power - law dependence can be identified within the region of vanishing @xmath83 . more profound discussion of this fact is presented in sec.6 .",
    "in this section we try to avoid the problem of finite - size - scaling related to true equilibrium critical temperature @xmath84 and critical exponents .",
    "the problem is solved by the multi - lattice self - organized simulations based on the dynamical rules treating the information from running averages of magnetization .",
    "the considerations are addressed to models , where 2nd order phase transitions take place .",
    "the proposal is again applied to 2d  ising ferromagnet on the square lattice .",
    "the quantity indicating deviations of magnetization order parameter @xmath85 from the gaussianity is the fourth - order cumulant @xmath86    the standard way leading to true @xmath87 is the construction of the temperature dependences @xmath88 , @xmath89 for two lattices @xmath90 .",
    "then @xmath84 follows from the condition of the scale - invariance @xmath91 according it the self - organized multi - lattice mc simulation method consists of the following three main points repeated in the canonical order for the counter @xmath92 :    1 .",

    "the parametric tuning recovers that stabilization of the noncanonical equilibrium via feedback @xmath108 requires smaller @xmath109 and @xmath110 than single - lattice simulations based on action of @xmath111 .",

    "the sand pile is stabilized if the rest state occurring for @xmath240 is reached .",
    "the main idea of replica approach is that the relative motion of @xmath223 with respect to @xmath219 enhances the nonlinearity responsible for a wide range of @xmath241 responses to @xmath238 .",
