    "to conclude , we have presented a realistic theoretical analysis of an original all - optical setup designed for bose - einstein condensation .",
    "this setup is based on crossed laguerre - gaussian laser beams .",
    "our analysis is made in realistic experimental conditions : the results presented here require for instance 5w@760.4 nm , with a laser detuning @xmath130thz and with laser ring sizes @xmath161 m , corresponding to laser waist radius @xmath162 m . in these trapping potentials ,",
    "the photon scattering rate can be reduced down to extremely low values , of the order of a few 10@xmath163s@xmath134 , thus providing long coherence times for the trapped atoms .",
    "we have shown that high laguerre - gauss azimuthal orders @xmath0 provide increased condensation temperatures ( + 50% ) when compared to the usual harmonic trapping situation . in this case , the condensate formed for different values of @xmath0 has the same typical size but has a different shape .",
    "furthermore , a substantial speed - up ( up to one order of magnitude ) for the time of formation of the condensate is also predicted . these improvements , whose physical origin lies in the density of states associated with these traps , along with the long coherence times expected in dark optical traps , could be influential in domains where large condensate occupation numbers are necessary , or where higher experimental repetition rates are desired .",
    "in addition , this all - optical trapping configuration should allow for the experimental exploration of the crossover between a quasi - homogeneous bose gas and an inhomogeneous one formed for instance in a harmonic trap .",
    "for @xmath164 , one is left with an almost perfect homogeneous bose gas , and the influence of long - wavelength non - perturbative critical fluctuations on @xmath92 should become measurable .    finally , compared to recent experimental realizations of bose - einstein condensates in a box realized with hermite - gaussian tem@xmath165 laser beams@xcite , our proposal should lead to a much greater steepness of the repulsive walls , and therefore to a better experimental modeling of a homogeneous trap .",

    "<S> we investigate theoretically an original route to achieve bose - einstein condensation using dark power - law laser traps . </S>",
    "<S> we propose to create such traps with two crossing blue - detuned laguerre - gaussian optical beams . </S>",
    "<S> controlling their azimuthal order @xmath0 allows for the exploration of a multitude of power - law trapping situations in one , two and three dimensions , ranging from the usual harmonic trap to an almost square - well potential , in which a quasi - homogeneous bose gas can be formed . </S>",
    "<S> the usual cigar - shaped and disk - shaped bose - einstein condensates obtained in a 1d or 2d harmonic trap take the generic form of a `` finger '' or of a `` hockey puck '' in such laguerre - gaussian traps . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , for a fixed atom number , higher transition temperatures are obtained in such configurations when compared with a harmonic trap of same volume . </S>",
    "<S> this effect , which results in a substantial acceleration of the condensation dynamics , requires a better but still reasonable focusing of the laguerre - gaussian beams . </S>"
