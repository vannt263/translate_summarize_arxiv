    "lattice qcd studies indicate that the hadronic matter undergoes a phase transition to the deconfined quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase , at a sufficiently high temperature ( @xmath4 200 mev ) @xcite .",
    "the energy density at which this transition is expected to occur is about 2 gev/@xmath5 .",
    "such a phase of deconfined partons did exist in the very early universe and is expected to be created in the laboratory , in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions ( urhic ) .",
    "the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) at bnl ( au - au collisions at @xmath6 200 gev ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern ( pb - pb collisions at @xmath7 5.5 tev ) will provide the best opportunity to study the formation of qgp .",
    "the main signatures of formation of qgp are sought in ( 1 ) @xmath8 suppression , ( 2 ) strangeness enhancement and ( 3 ) dilepton and photon productions @xcite .",
    "different stages through which the evolution of deconfined quark - gluon matter proceeds are ( 1 ) pre - equilibrium ( 2 ) equilibrium and ( 3 ) hadronization .",
    "while the equilibrium stage is described by the well known hydrodynamic equations @xcite , it is a difficult problem to study the formation and pre - equilibrium evolution of qgp in urhic .",
    "nevertheless , the initial conditions which one assumes for the hydrodynamic expansion , can only be determined by a careful study of the pre - equilibrium stage .",
    "so it is necessary and important to study the pre - equilibrium stage , which would provide information on the equilibration time , and the bulk properties such as the temperature , the energy density and the number density of qgp .",
    "for example , the importance of the correct determination of the equilibration time , in connection with the @xmath8 suppression , is stressed by many people @xcite and it is a challenging task to determine this quantity accurately .    in this paper",
    ", we study the pre - equilibrium evolution of qgp within the color flux - tube model . in this model ,",
    "when two lorentz - contracted nuclei collide head - on and pass through each other , they acquire a nonzero color charge ( @xmath9 ) , by a random exchange of soft gluons . the two receding nuclei act as color capacitor plates and produce a chromoelectric field between them @xcite .",
    "this chromoelectric field causes instability of the qcd vacuum and creates @xmath10 and gluon pairs via the schwinger - like mechanism @xcite .",
    "the partons so produced , collide with each other and also get accelerated due to the background field .",
    "these color charges also rotate in the color space according to wong s equation @xcite .",
    "we consider relativistic non - abelian transport equations for quarks , antiquarks and gluons .",
    "these equations simultaneously include the convective flow terms , the background field acceleration terms , the @xmath10 and gluon production source terms , the collision terms and the terms which take into account rotations of these color charges due to the background chromoelectric field .",
    "we solve these transport equations together with the yang - mills equations .    as mentioned above",
    ", the initial chromoelectric field owes its existence to nonperturbative processes , viz . , the soft - gluon exchanges that take place between the two nuclei during the collision .",
    "this model describes mostly the production of soft partons @xcite . as pointed out in @xcite and also in @xcite , the ( semi)hard processes ( via perturbative qcd ) take place before the soft - gluon exchanges . by adding these hard processes to the color flux - tube model , _ we attempt to cover the full range of particle production mechanisms , thereby including both soft and hard partons in the evolution of the deconfined parton matter .",
    "_ it has been shown by several authors that minijet production is dominant in the very early stages of the collision of two nuclei at the rhic and lhc energies @xcite .",
    "earlier studies @xcite of the pre - equilibrium domain ignored the minijets . in this paper",
    ", we have calculated the minijet production at rhic and lhc and have combined it with the color flux - tube model to study the production and evolution of qgp .",
    "a similar attempt was made by eskola and gyulassy @xcite within the hydrodynamics framework which is applicable only _ after _ local equilibrium is attained . here",
    "we study the _ pre - equilibrium _",
    "evolution by solving relativistic non - abelian transport equations with both the hard and soft partons taken into account .",
    "_ we address ourselves to the important question whether qgp , if formed , would attain substantially higher temperatures at lhc than at rhic .",
    "_ we also investigate relative importance of the hard and soft production mechanisms .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe our model with a detailed discussion of minijet production and of transport equations with their analytic solutions . here",
    "we also present our computational procedure . in section iii",

    "we then compare our model with some other models of the early evolution of the matter in urhic . finally in section iv",
    ", we present our conclusions .",
    "in our model , all hard and semihard partons ( i.e. , minijets ) are formed before the chromoelectric field is created due to the exchange of soft gluons . in all earlier studies of pre - equilibrium evolution of qgp within the color flux - tube model @xcite , there was only the background field and no particles , at the initial time .",
    "in other words , the initial particle distribution functions were taken to be zero in all these calculations . in the present work ,",
    "we obtain the initial particle distributions from minijets . with this initial condition",

    "we take @xmath104 and @xmath105 fm . for the initial field energy density @xmath106",
    ", we take either @xmath107 or 300 gev/@xmath5 .",
    "this allows us to discuss the following three scenarios : ( a ) vanishing field , ( b ) @xmath106 comparable to the initial minijet energy density @xmath64 , and ( c ) @xmath108 .",
    "thus we can study the effect of the variation of the initial field on the calculated results .",
    "in all the figures , @xmath71 corresponds to the instant when the two colliding nuclei have just passed through each other , and @xmath109 gev/@xmath5 unless stated otherwise .    in fig . 1 ,",
    "we have presented the parton energy densities for rhic and lhc .",
    "it can be seen that the evolution of the parton energy density with minijet inputs at rhic , is almost the same as that without the minijet inputs ( dashed curve ) .",
    "this is because , at rhic , the initial minijet energy density @xmath64 ( @xmath110 gev/@xmath5 ) is negligible compared to @xmath106 ; see table i. at lhc , the two results are different because @xmath64 ( @xmath111 gev/@xmath5 ) is comparable to @xmath106 .",
    "_ thus the inclusion of the minijet input substantially alters the evolution of the parton energy density unless the chromoelectric field is too strong . _",
    "we now discuss qualitatively the shapes of the curves in fig .",
    "it is easy to see from eq .",
    "( [ dist ] ) that the parton energy density evolves as @xmath112 here , @xmath113 is the energy density if there is no minijet production , i.e. , if the particle production is only from the field .",
    "the decrease in the energy density at earlier times ( see the curve labelled lhc in fig .",
    "1 ) is due to the multiplicative factor @xmath114 occurring in eq .",
    "( [ ept ] ) .",
    "the further increase in the energy density is due to the fact that the particle production from the field starts dominating by this time ( this is @xmath113 in eq .",
    "( [ ept ] ) )",
    ". we shall show below that the fall in the energy density after it reaches the maximum value is close to what is expected if the system has attained a local equilibrium and is expanding according to the hydrodynamic equations .",
    "then it is clear from fig . 1 that",
    "_ the equilibration of plasma is expected to occur earlier and the temperature at equilibration is expected to be somewhat higher at lhc .",
    "_ this will have a significant effect on all the predictions of qgp signatures .    in fig .",
    "2 , we compare the evolution of the parton energy density , at lhc , with and without the background field . this is necessary because the initial strength of the field can not be calculated easily and as the incident energy increases the possibility of soft - gluon exchanges may become small .",
    "so we have presented our results for the two extreme cases ( 1 ) vanishing field energy density and ( 2 ) a very high initial field energy density ( 300 gev/@xmath5 ) .",
    "the actual results are expected to fall within these two limits",
    ". qualitatively similar results are expected at the rhic energy too .",
    "thus the background field representing the collective long - range effects plays an important role in the evolution of the system .",
    "if the minijet initial conditions based on pqcd are to play an important role at rhic , then the field will have to be about two orders of magnitude weaker than what we have assumed .",
    "in other words , if at rhic , the initial field energy density @xmath106 was not 300 gev/@xmath5 , but only 3 gev/@xmath5 , then @xmath106 would be comparable to the initial minijet energy density @xmath64(rhic ) @xmath110 gev/@xmath5 , and results qualitatively similar to those shown in fig .",
    "2 would be obtained at the rhic energy too . in the hijing @xcite and parton cascade models @xcite ,",
    "the background field was completely neglected .",
    "comparison of the two curves labelled ` field ' and ` field+minijets ' , in fig ( 2 ) , shows the effect of the minijets on @xmath95 .",
    "the memory of the minijet input is nearly wiped out at large @xmath70 because of the exponential decay factor in eq .",
    "( [ ept ] ) .",
    "_ as a result , the large kinetic energy of the two colliding nuclei at lhc may not necessarily translate into large temperature of the equilibrated deconfined matter . _",
    "actual calculation shows that the temperature when the equilibrium is reached is @xmath3 mev at lhc and @xmath2 mev at rhic , _ not very different from each other_. comparison of the two curves labelled ` minijets ' and ` field+minijets ' shows the effect of the field on @xmath95 ; this effect survives till relatively larger @xmath70 .",
    "note also that _ if there is no background field , the @xmath95 decreases monotonically .",
    "_    the decay of the chromoelectric field is shown in fig .",
    "the decay is much faster at lhc than at rhic , again suggesting an early equilibration at lhc .",
    "the evolution of the field strength has a significant impact on the acceleration of partons .",
    "if the chromoelectric field survives even after local equilibrium is reached , then the subsequent evolution of the system is governed by the chromoviscous hydrodynamic equations @xcite , instead of bjorken s hydrodynamic equations @xcite .",
    "so it is very important to study the evolution of the chromoelectric field in the pre - equilibrium stage .",
    "we find that the equilibration time of the deconfined matter and the life - time of the field are nearly the same .",
    "_    in fig .",
    "4 , we have presented the parton number densities of the system , for both the rhic and lhc energies .",
    "the behavior of the results is the same as that of the parton energy densities in fig . 1 ,",
    "because an equation similar to eq .",
    "( [ ept ] ) holds for the number density too .",
    "the maximum number density at lhc is @xmath115 @xmath116 , whereas at rhic it is @xmath117 @xmath116 .",
    "_ however , at large @xmath70 , when the systems have equilibrated , the two number densities are nearly the same . _",
    "these partons produce / affect all the signatures of qgp and hence their evolution plays a crucial role in qgp detection .",
    "we have fitted @xmath118 and @xmath94 , for @xmath119 fm , at the lhc energy , with a functional form @xmath120 , where @xmath121 and @xmath122 are constants .",
    "we find that @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively .",
    "according to bjorken s hydrodynamics , these values are @xmath125 and @xmath126 , respectively . comparing these two sets of values with each other ,",
    "we conclude that the system has nearly equilibrated at @xmath127 fm , at lhc .",
    "similarly , at rhic , the equilibration time is found to be @xmath128 fm . recall that these time intervals are measured from the instant when the two colliding nuclei have just passed through each other .    in figs . 5 and 6 ,",
    "we have presented our results for the number densities of quarks plus antiquarks and gluons , respectively .",
    "consider the curves labelled lhc in these two figures . the initial number density in fig .",
    "5 is much less than that in fig .",
    "6 , because the minijet gluon production is much larger ; see eqs .",
    "( 3)-(10 ) . in fig .",
    "5 , initially , the number density increases with time because of the large production of @xmath40 and @xmath129 from the field ; see eq .",
    "( [ ntau ] ) which receives a separate contribution from each of the 3 flavors of quarks and antiquarks .",
    "although the gluon production is 1.5 times more likely than that of quarks via the schwinger - like mechanism @xcite , the counting in eq .",
    "( [ ntau ] ) eventually builds up a larger quark plus antiquark density than the gluon density . in fig .",
    "6 , the lhc number density decreases with time because of the dominance of the exponential factor @xmath130 in eq .",
    "( [ dist ] ) , over the gluon production by the field .",
    "the energy densities for quarks plus antiquarks and gluons are plotted in figs . 7 and 8 , respectively .",
    "the behavior remains the same as in figs .",
    "5 and 6 .",
    "we now compare our model with some well known models of the early stages of the ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions , namely the parton cascade model ( pcm ) @xcite , the hijing model @xcite , the mclerran - venugopalan model ( mvm ) @xcite , etc .    as is well known , pcm is a pqcd - based model .",
    "it neglects the long - range collective effects which we have attempted to incorporate here by means of a background field .",
    "the pcm starts by defining a classical phase - space distribution function for the two incoming nuclei , which is then evolved by means of the boltzmann equation retaining only the convective - flow term and the collision term in eq .",
    "now it is known that there are wee partons in each of the two nuclei and each wee parton spreads over the entire width of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to define a classical distribution function for such a system of particles . indeed",
    "the incoming nuclei are in pure quantum mechanical states . hence solving the classical transport equation right from the instant",
    "the two incoming nuclei start touching each other , is a questionable procedure .",
    "a classical distribution function can be more justifiably defined when the spatial extent and the time intervals are larger than the average de broglie wave length of the partons . in our model , we have started the classical evolution at a time when the two nuclei have completely crossed each other . at that instant , in our model , there are only hard partons ( @xmath131 gev / c ) ; the soft partons are created later when the system has grown even bigger . the initial condition for the hard part",
    "is obtained via the minijet calculation where no approximation is involved .",
    "the initial condition for the soft part is taken through the creation of a coherent chromoelectric field .",
    "the hijing model too is a pqcd - based model .",
    "it combines pqcd processes with string phenomenology for non - perturbative soft processes .",
    "it _ assumes _ that the parton distributions can be approximated by thermal phase - space distributions with non - equilibrium fugacities .",
    "thus the issue of thermalization of the deconfined matter in the framework of the kinetic theory is not addressed .",
    "thus we have presented a model which is different from pcm and the hijing model .",
    "we believe that this model has some desirable features . for simplicity , we have neglected the interactions among the minijets before @xmath71 .",
    "our main aim has been to see how the minijet input modifies our earlier analysis @xcite .",
    "it will be interesting to consider these interactions .",
    "although pqcd provides a general framework for this purpose , including these interactions is quite nontrivial .",
    "our approach has some similarities with the mclerran - venugopalan model .",
    "the mvm is a classical effective field theory description of the small-@xmath132 modes in very large nuclei at very high energies .",
    "this effective theory contains a scale @xmath133 which is proportional to the large gluon density at small @xmath132 .",
    "the large gluon density ensures that even if the coupling is weak , the fields may be highly nonperturbative .",
    "they argued that the classical fields corresponding to the saddle point solutions of the effective theory are the non - abelian analogue of the weizscker - williams fields in classical electrodynamics .",
    "now in a collision of such weizscker - williams fields , the production of incoherent partons with transverse momenta @xmath134 can be handled by means of pqcd and their propagation in the coherent field can be studied with the help of a classical transport equation @xcite . in our model too both incoherent hard partons and coherent field ( soft part ) are taken into account .",
    "so in this sense our approach is similar to mvm .",
    "real - time simulation of the full , nonperturbative evolution of the classical non - abelian weizscker - williams fields on lattice , for the gauge group @xmath135 , has recently been studied by krasnitz and venugopalan @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "the calculation in @xcite incorporates coherence effects which become important at small @xmath132 and small @xmath20 , while reproducing simultaneously the standard minijet results at large @xmath20 .",
    "however , the important issue of equilibration of gluons was not addressed .",
    "it will also be interesting to see both the coherent field and incoherent partons simultaneously taken into account in such a simulation .",
    "we have studied the production and equilibration of the quark - gluon plasma expected to be formed in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions , at rhic and lhc , within the color flux - tube model .",
    "the distribution functions of quarks , antiquarks and gluons are defined in the extended phase space of dimension 14 in su(3 ) .",
    "we have solved the non - abelian relativistic transport equations for these distribution functions .",
    "the quarks , antiquarks and gluons are produced from the background field which is formed due to soft - gluon exchanges , via the schwinger - like mechanism .",
    "the initial distribution functions of partons are calculated from the minijet production at rhic and lhc .",
    "( _ iii _ ) surprisingly , in spite of the large difference between the lhc and rhic colliding beam energies , the differences between the temperatures and equilibrium energy and number densities attained at the two machines , may not be very large .",
    "this is because the memory of the minijet input decays exponentially with time .",
    "estimated numerical values for these physical quantities are given .          in summary ,",
    "we have combined the non - perturbative aspects of qgp ( background chromoelectric field formation ) with the perturbative aspects ( minijet production ) and have studied the evolution of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "we have used in this work the schwinger - like source terms @xcite for parton production from a chromoelectric field .",
    "this mechanism is strictly applicable only for a constant , uniform field .",
    "however , in a heavy - ion collision , as the system evolves , the field acquires space - time dependence .",
    "particle production in such a field has been studied and an appropriate source term has been derived in @xcite , which will be incorporated in the pre - equilibrium evolution of the qgp and results will be reported elsewhere .",
    "recently bloch et al . have studied the thermodynamics of strong - field plasmas @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we used a classical transport equation while they have used a quantum equation .",
    "our equation is non - abelian , theirs is abelian .",
    "our initial conditions are different from theirs .",
    "our source term is also different from theirs .",
    "but still the time dependence of the various quantities ( their figs . 1 - 3 ) is qualitatively similar to that obtained by us .",
    "this shows the robustness of our findings .",
