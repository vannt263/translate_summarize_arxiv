    "the annual data traffic generated by mobile devices is expected to surpass @xmath1 exabits by 2020 @xcite .",
    "this deluge of traffic will significantly exacerbate the spectrum crunch that cellular providers are already experiencing . to address this issue ,",
    "it is envisioned that in @xmath0 g cellular systems certain portions of the mmwave band will be used , spanning the spectrum between @xmath2 ghz to @xmath3 ghz with the corresponding wavelengths between @xmath4-@xmath5 mm @xcite .",
    "this will substantially increase the spectrum available to cellular providers , which is currently between @xmath6 mhz and @xmath7 ghz with only @xmath8 mhz of bandwidth allocation for all current cellular technologies .",
    "however , before mmwave communications can become a reality , there are significant challenges that need to be overcome .",
    "firstly , compared with the rf bands ( i.e. , sub-6 ghz ) , the propagation loss in the mmwave band is much higher due to atmospheric absorption and low penetration .",
    "while small wavelengths allow deployment of large antenna arrays in relatively small chip areas , it causes several other issues such as high energy consumption by components ( e.g. , analog - to - digital ( a / d ) converters ) .",
    "for instance , at a sampling rate of @xmath9 gsamples / sec , an @xmath10bit quantizer consumes @xmath11mw of power . during active transmissions",
    ", this would constitute up to @xmath12 of the overall power consumed for a typical smart phone .",
    "moreover , in order to fully utilize the directional antenna arrays , continuous beamforming and signal training at the receiver is needed @xcite .",
    "digital beamforming is highly efficient in delay , but there is a need for a separate a / d converter for each antenna , which may not be feasible for even a small to mid - sized antenna array due to high energy consumption .",
    "in contrast , analog beamforming requires only one a / d , but it can focus on one direction at a time , making the angular search costly in delay .",
    "there are also proposals on hybrid digital / analog beamforming , which strikes a balance between analog and digital beamforming , using a few a / d converters rather than one per antenna @xcite .",
    "secondly , a given mmwave channel can be highly variable with intermittent connectivity since most objects lead to blocking and reflections as opposed to scattering and diffraction in typical rf frequencies .",
    "when the users and/or surrounding objects are mobile , different propagation paths become highly variable with intermittent on - off periods , which can potentially result in long outages and poor mmwave delay performance . on the other hand , ultimately , the very - high bandwidth available in the mmwave band should translate into performance guarantees , required by next generation real - time applications that are expected to dominate the traffic in the next generation networks . in order to address the high energy consumption by components and beamforming overhead in mmwave",
    ", we consider a hybrid rf / mmwave beamforming scheme .",
    "due to high cost and energy consumption by a / d converters in fully - digital beamforming as well as the delay in fully - analog beamforming , we investigate the feasibility of conducting a coarse angle of arrival ( aoa ) estimation on the rf channel and then utilizing the fully - analog beamforming for fine tuning and transmissions . in this case , our a / d follows the beamformer at the receiver , eliminating the need for a separate a / d per antenna in the mmwave antenna array . to this end , we first experimentally verify the correlation between the rf and mmwave aoa , especially in the presence of line - of - sight ( los ) .",
    "our measurements taken jointly at different bands and for both _ indoor and outdoor settings _ show that under los conditions and in @xmath13 of all measurements , the identified aoa of signal in the rf band is within @xmath14 accuracy for the aoa of the mmwave signal .",
    "based on the estimated rf aoa , the angular range over which we scan for the mmwave transmitter reduces to no more than @xmath15 on average , from @xmath16 in stand - alone mmwave systems .",
    "the authors in @xcite have also proposed a beamforming method based on out - of - band measurements for @xmath17 ghz wifi and under _",
    "static indoor _ conditions .    to mitigate the issue of highly intermittent mmwave connectivity",
    ", we consider a hybrid rf / mmwave transceiver model , in which , in addition to beamforming , the rf interface is used for data transfer .",
    "the link speed of the mmwave interface ( multi - gbps ) is comparable to the speed at which a typical processor in a smart device operates .",
    "this is different from classical wireless interfaces in which data rates are much smaller than the clock speeds of the processors .",
    "thus , the mmwave interface can not be assumed to operate at smaller time - scales and the algorithms run at the processor may not be able to respond to variations in real time and execute control decisions .",
    "_ this necessitates the use of proactive queue - control solutions along with a reasonably large buffer at the mmwave interface .",
    "_ for instance , if the queue size at the mmwave interface gets small , the risk of wasting the abundant capacity from mmwave increases .",
    "conversely , if we keep the queue at the mmwave interface large , if the channel goes down , we incur a high delay .    to understand the tradeoff between full exploitation of the mmwave capacity and the delay for mmwave channel access , _ we model the hybrid rf / mmwave transceiver as a communication network , and investigate an optimal scheduling policy using network optimization tools .",
    "_ in the equivalent network model , the rf and mmwave interfaces are represented by individual network nodes with dedicated queues .",
    "hence , the optimal transmission policy across the rf and mmwave interfaces is transformed into an optimal scheduling policy across the rf and mmwave nodes .",
    "we formulate an optimal scheduling problem where the objective is to achieve maximum mmwave channel utilization with bounded delay performance subsequently , in order to determine `` when '' a data packet should be added to the rf or mmwave queues , we prove that the optimal policy is of the _ threshold - type _ such that the scheduler routes the arrival traffic to the mmwave queue if and only if its queue length is smaller than a threshold .",
    "we show that the threshold - based scheduling policy efficiently captures the dynamics of the mmwave channel , and indeed maximizes the channel utilization .    in summary ,",
    "our main contributions are as follows :    * we have conducted a wide variety of experiments to evaluate the correlation between the measured channel gains for the @xmath2 ghz mmwave and @xmath18 ghz rf interfaces under various indoor and outdoor situations involving existence of los between the transmitter and receiver .",
    "* we propose a hybrid rf / mmwave system that exploits the cross - interface correlations for beamforming as well as data transfer .",
    "our a / d follows the beamformer at the receiver , and eliminates the need for a separate a / d for each element in the mmwave antenna - array .",
    "* we propose a framework to model the hybrid rf / mmwave transceiver as a network and jointly manage the transmission across the rf and mmwave interfaces .",
    "our queue management formulation explicitly takes into account the mmwave channel dynamics , and our approach enables full utilization of the available mmwave channel capacity , despite the highly variable nature of the channel .",
    "we prove using subadditivity analysis that the optimal scheduling policy is a simple threshold based one , which can be easily adopted despite the high link variations .",
    "we should emphasize that the rf / mmwave correlation was studied in @xcite , and applied only for beamforming in @xcite .",
    "however , a coherent design that fully integrates the rf and mmwave interfaces and optimally design the rf / mmwave transceivers is missing .",
    "hence , we aim to develop a hybrid architecture for which the rf interface is utilized for both beamforming and data transfer .",
    "we use the following notation throughout the paper .",
    "bold uppercase and lowercase letters are used for matrices and vectors , respectively , while non - bold letters are used for scalers .",
    "in addition , @xmath19 denotes the conjugate transpose , @xmath20 denotes the matrix trace operator , and @xmath21 $ ] denotes the expectation operator .",
    "the rf and mmwave variables are denoted by @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "we classify existing and related work across the following thrusts :      wireless channel fading is primarily studied under two disparate categories based on the impact and the time - scale of the associated variations : large - scale ( due to shadowing , path loss , etc . ) and small - scale ( due to mobility combined with multipath ) . there",
    "exist numerous measurement and experimentation efforts in order to understand mmwave propagation and the effect of slow scale and large scale fading in the mmwave band ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the main objective has been to extend the existing far - field ray - tracing models to accurately represent various phenomena observed in mmwave .",
    "for example , in  @xcite , a model based on isolated clusters is argued to be more appropriate to capture the observed reflections in mmwave , as opposed to the uniform distribution across the delay taps .",
    "extensive evaluations of mmwave propagation taken from hundreds of different locations and settings also exist , by the same group  @xcite as well as others  @xcite .",
    "our goal is to neither replicate nor expand these observations .",
    "instead , we are interested in the channel / propagation environment correlation across different interfaces under various conditions , including indoor and outdoor situations , with mobility , and existence of los .      there has been extensive amount of work on digital and analog beamforming methods ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there are also proposals on hybrid beamforming methods @xcite in which the term `` hybrid '' refers to the mixture of analog / digital ( different from our hybrid rf / mmwave system ) .",
    "the whole operation there is in sole mmwave domain .",
    "recently , there have been proposals on leveraging out - of - band information in order to enhance the mmwave performance .",
    "the authors in @xcite propose a transform method to translate the spatial correlation matrix at the rf band into the correlation matrix of the mmwave channel .",
    "the authors in @xcite consider the @xmath17 ghz indoor wifi network , and investigate the correlation between the estimated aoa at the rf band with the mmwave aoa in order to reduce the beam - steering overhead .",
    "the authors in @xcite propose a compressed beam selection method which is based on out - of - band spatial information obtained at sub-6 ghz band . in the context of hybrid communications and data transfer ,",
    "the authors in @xcite studied a dual interface system to offload cellular data over wifi network . in another line of research , there are proposals to integrate 3 g , wifi and wimax @xcite .",
    "there have also been some recent studies @xcite of potential approaches for higher layer design in mmwave networks .",
    "these approaches mainly focus on multiple access schemes , given the unique propagation characteristics of the medium .",
    "our work is distinguished from the previous work as ( i ) we experimentally investigate the rf / mmwave correlation under practical scenarios , and demonstrate that how mobility affects the channel conditions and cross - interface correlation , and ( ii ) we propose a holistic rf / mmwave architecture wherein the rf interface is exploited for beamforming as well as data transfer in order to reduce the energy consumption and prevent high delay caused by mmwave outages .",
    "figure [ fig : system ] illustrates the basic components of our proposed hybrid architecture that exploits the correlation between the mmwave and rf channels as it pertains to large - scale effects and aoa in the presence of los path @xcite . by utilizing this architecture",
    ", we address the energy and delay issues as follows .    *",
    "the energy issue : * the proposed hybrid architecture addresses the energy issue by :    * exploiting the cross - interface correlation to achieve the beamforming fully in the analog domain .",
    "thus , our a / d follows the beamformer at the receiver , eliminating the need for a separate one , for all elements in the mmwave antenna - array . * moving all mmwave control signaling and channel state information ( csi ) feedback to the rf interface , and thus avoiding the two - way beamforming and reverse channel transmission costs in mmwave .",
    "[ fig : system ]    * the delay issue : * the mmwave channel is highly sensitive and outages can be long , which in turn , leads to unacceptably high delays for delay - sensitive applications .",
    "however , a conservative use of the mmwave link is not desirable either , since the upside of the mmwave channel can be enormous , especially in the presence of los , which occurs intermittently .",
    "more importantly , the high data rate of the mmwave link necessitates the use of a reasonably large buffer at the mmwave interface along with proactive queue - control solutions . in this context ,",
    "our hybrid architecture exploits the cross - interface correlation to select which interface(s ) to use and control the queue sizes of interfaces to guarantee a constrained mmwave delay while the mmwave bandwidth is fully utilized .",
    "we investigate the optimal interface scheduling in section [ rf - assisted - communication ] .",
    "the rf system model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mmwave - model ] where we use digital beamforming . as a result",
    ", the received signal at the receiver can be written as : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the rf - channel matrix and @xmath26 is the transmitted signal vector in rf .",
    "entries of circularly symmetric white gaussian noise are denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "the rf receiver uses the steering vector @xmath28 to align the received signals where the optimal steering direction @xmath29 can be obtained based on maximizing the snr , i.e. , : @xmath30 in which @xmath31 is the covariance matrix , and @xmath32 is the noise power .      the mmwave system model is shown in fig . [ fig : mmwave - model ] . unlike rf , we use analog combining for mmwave via a single a / d to avoid high a / d overhead .",
    "consequently , the signal at the input of the decoder is a scalar , identical to a weighted combination of signal @xmath33 across all antennas .",
    "thus , the received signal at the mmwave receiver can be written as : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the analog - receive and digital - transmit beamforming vectors , and the white gaussian noise component is denoted by @xmath37 .",
    "consequently , the signal at the input of the decoder is a scalar , identical to a weighted combination of signal @xmath33 across all antennas . _",
    "note that , our formulation can readily be extended to the case with digital combining at mmwave , in case a / d conversion is made at the output of each antenna_.    in the mmwave domain , the channel matrix @xmath38 has a singular value decomposition @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are rotation unitary matrices and @xmath42 is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are nonnegative real numbers @xmath43 , where @xmath44 .",
    "the mmwave - channel matrix @xmath38 is low rank @xcite , and since the rank of @xmath38 is equal to the number of non - zero singular values , we restrict our attention to only the largest eigenvalue @xmath45 and assume that @xmath46 , and that @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
    "in fact , our experimental results show that under the los conditions , there is about @xmath49 db gain improvement due to the strongest eigenmode , and thus we assume that the state of link can be characterized based on the value of @xmath45 . given the assumed channel models , next we experimentally investigate the correlation between the rf and mmwave channels under various conditions .      *",
    "experimental setup : * we simultaneously observe the rf and mmwave channels via a dual transmitter - receiver pair in the same location . in the rf platform , we use an omni - directional antenna operating at @xmath18 ghz as a transmitter and @xmath50 omni - directional antennas as a receiver in order to observe the aoa for the incoming rf signal .",
    "our experimental setup is shown in fig .",

    "we use @xmath2 ghz directional antennas to be able to align the beams .",
    "we measure the channel across the @xmath16 space with @xmath51 step size .",
    "based on a large set of measurements , we conclude that the propagation situations can be classified into three types as it pertains to summarizing the connection between the large - scale effects in rf and mmwave : line - of - sight ( los ) , blocker , and non line - of - sight ( nlos ) .",
    "los implies that there is a strong line of sight path between the transmitter and the receiver ; blocker indicates that , the los path for the mmwave interface is being blocked by a non - stationary obstacle ; and nlos indicates the presence of a stationary obstacle , unlikely to change in time .",
    "[ fig : indoor_outdoor_measurements ]    * experimental observations : * figure [ fig : indoor_outdoor_measurements ] provides our _ indoor and outdoor _ measurement results , taken simultaneously for rf and mmwave .",
    "the output of the music algorithm is given on the top plots , and the important thing to focus on is the correct aoa in each situation .",
    "note that the aoa is different across different observations plotted .",
    "once that aoa is identified , we compare it with the signal strength ( bottom plots ) we measured along that direction for the mmwave signal generated at the transmitter location as the rf signal . for the los situation , for both indoor and outdoor",
    ", there is a strong correlation in the angular composition and the strength of signal coming across all angles in rf and mmwave .",
    "this observation is in agreement with @xcite .",
    "indeed , in @xmath13 of all measurements , we have identified the aoa predicted by music within a @xmath14 accuracy for the aoa of the mmwave signal . as a result , based on rf measurements , the correct mmwave transmitter location can be almost perfectly identified under los . from fig .",
    "[ fig : indoor_outdoor_measurements ] , it is evident that as we lose the los , the rf / mmwave correlation is lost and the signal strength in mmwave starts to drop rapidly .",
    "however , depending on the size and the location of the blocker , aoa estimation accuracy varies .",
    "for instance , for a small / mid - size blocker in the middle , in @xmath52 of the observations do the rf and mmwave signals have their strongest paths within @xmath14 of each other . in this context ,",
    "[ hb_effect ] demonstrates the effect of human blocker located in the middle compared with when the blocker moves very close to the receiver . from the results",
    ", we note that as the blocker moves towards the receiver , the correlation decreases .",
    "[ hb_effect ]    from the presented experimental results , our major observation is that in los situations , there is a high correlation between the observed rf and mmwave signals , both in signal strength and aoa .",
    "therefore , los instances should be exploited in mmwave as much as possible , since there is an associated @xmath53 db channel gain improvement as well . in order to detect los situations , fig .",
    "[ fig : mobility ] illustrates the spatial variations of the mmwave channel gain in los and reflection situations .",
    "we observe that the los situation is quite robust with respect to slight movements , i.e. , the large - scale effects lead to minor variations in the channel gain , if the presence of los is preserved . on the other hand ,",
    "if the los is blocked and the connection depends on a strong reflector , channel gain becomes relatively unstable and slight movements can result in drastic changes in the channel . as a result",
    ", we use the sensitivity of channel gain to slight movements in order to predict the loss of los and take the necessary precautions for a smoother transition in order to mitigate the negative effects of connection losses on the user experience . in order to detect los situations , the authors in @xcite use the ratio of the highest signal strength component to the average received signal energy ( i.e. , peak to average power ratio ( papr ) ) as an indicator for los inference . as a result , under mobility",
    ", the papr can be paired with our indicator to boost the los detection accuracy .          in order to overcome the harsh nature of mmwave channels and compensate for large propagation losses , highly directional antenna arrays",
    "along with beamforming techniques are needed . however , deploying directional antenna arrays makes the cell discovery and access methods costly in terms of delay .",
    "this effect is more pronounced when mobility of users are taken into account where rapid handovers within small - scale cells are needed .",
    "digital beamforming is highly efficient in delay where with the observations from all receive antennas , beamforming can be done by one - shot processing of the observed beacons .",
    "however , digital beamforming requires high energy consumption . on the other hand , the analog beamforming is more energy efficient , but it can focus on one direction at a time , making the search process costly in delay . pertaining to the mmwave beamforming efficiency ,",
    "the mmwave channel is often sparse in the angular domain , with a few scattering clusters , each with several rays , in addition to a dominant los path @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to find the optimal mmwave steering direction @xmath54 , our proposed architecture exploits the correlation between the rf and mmwave aoa , and uses a coarse aoa estimation on the rf channel , followed by analog beamforming for fine tuning around the estimated aoa .",
    "the rf / mmwave aoa correlation reduces the angular search space and addresses the delay issue of fully - analog beamforming .",
    "the algorithm is specified below , and is graphically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ hybrid - beamform ] .        1 .",
    "start the system in the * rf - only * mode .",

    "use analog beamforming to fine tune the mmwave beam in the range of @xmath56 : 1 .",

    "2 .   otherwise , continue operation of the system in the * rf - only * mode .",
    "4 .   go to step ( 2 ) after every @xmath57 seconds wherein @xmath57 is a recalibration system parameter .",
    "* remark 1 : * as our experimental results show , the rf / mmwave correlation decreases as the los condition is lost . however , the rf - assisted beamforming relies on the cross - interface correlation , and once the correlation is lost , it falls back to the traditional beamforming scheme .",
    "* remark 2 : * the parameter of searching @xmath14 around the estimated aoa is set based on our experimental setup . in general , it will be configured based on dynamics of the scenario and antenna beamwidth .",
    "in the proposed hybrid architecture , once the dual rf / mmwave mode is activated , the load division component ( in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] ) schedules the arrival traffic over the rf and mmwave interfaces .",
    "the objective is to achieve maximum mmwave throughput with bounded delay performance . to this end",
    ", we model our hybrid rf / mmwave transceiver as a _ diamond network _ ( see fig .  [ network - model ] ) in which each of the rf and mmwave interfaces are represented by a separate node .",
    "moreover , a virtual destination ( i.e. , receiver ) node @xmath58 has been added , and since all data packets are destined for node @xmath58 , its queue length , @xmath59 , is set to be @xmath60 for all @xmath61 .",
    "the scheduler node @xmath62 queries the state information of its neighbor nodes , and assigns packets accordingly .",
    "however , due to the high data rate of the mmwave interface , real time tracking of the channel state may not be feasible , and thus , it is desirable to obtain a scheduling policy that is not directly expressed in terms of the csi .",
    "this is in contrast with the classical maxweight scheduling policies ( e.g. , backpressure ) that require csi information .",
    "we assume that the equivalent network model for the hybrid rf / mmwave transceiver evolves in discrete ( slotted ) time @xmath63 , and there is an exogenous packet arrival process with rate @xmath64 . to quantify the behavior of the mmwave link using the strongest eigenmode ( i.e. , corresponding to @xmath45 ) , a two - state model ( outage and non - outage )",
    "can be used .",
    "the probability of being in each state is a function of distance , and statistical models can be fit @xcite .",

    "[ fig : channel - mobile ] ) , @xmath68 corresponds to los situations , while @xmath69 can be mapped to the nlos situations like human blockers or when there are no strong reflectors .",
