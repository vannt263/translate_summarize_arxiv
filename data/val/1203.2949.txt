    "the broad - line region ( blr ) of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is thought to consist of a roughly spherical mist of cloudlets with characteristic densities in the range 10@xmath4 - 10@xmath5 @xmath6 and column densities of @xmath710@xmath8 @xmath9 , surrouding a central source emitting ionizing radiation roughly isotropically @xcite . despite the success of this traditional picture , in order to explain the strengths of the blr lines , the need for a high covering factor and the lack of lyman continuum absorption , a blr having a flattened distribution at least for the low - ionization gas has been proposed @xcite .",
    "the blr has been extensively studied from the x - rays to the nir regime during the last two decades ( see the reviews of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one of the most puzzling aspects of the line spectra emitted by the blr is the feii emission , whose numerous multiplets form a pseudo - continuum which extends from the uv to the optical region due to the blending of approximately 10@xmath10 lines .",
    "this emission constitutes one of the most important contributors to the cooling of the blr .",
    "indeed , the blending of several blr emission lines , including the large number of feii emission multiplets , prevents a reliable study of individual line profiles and the identification and measurement of weaker lines . as blending",
    "is minimized in the class of objects known as narrow - line seyfert  1 galaxies ( nls1s ) , their study can lead to a significantly more accurate study of the properties of the emission line region that is closer to the central source .",
    "@xcite , for instance , derived an optical template for the feii multiplets from izw1 , which has served since then to adjust the feii strength of several other objects , after a proper scaling and convolution to match the blr velocity dispersions ( estimated from strong emission lines ) .",
    "the advent of hst uv quasar spectral data allowed @xcite to extend the template method into the uv regime .",
    "they presented the first high s / n , high - resolution , quasar empirical uv iron template spectrum ranging from rest frame 1250    to 3090   , which is applicable to quasar data .",
    "the template was based on hst ( archival ) data of izw1 .",
    "the iron emission templates have importance not only for our ability to measure and subtract the iron emission in quasar spectra , but also as a tool through which we can study the iron emission strength itself .",
    "iron is a key coolant emitting @xmath725% of the total energy output from the blr @xcite , emphasizing the importance of including the iron emission in studies of the blr .",
    "however , despite the wide use of such templates , most of the physical mechanisms that produce such lines remain under debate .",
    "there have been a number of pioneering theoretical investigations about the feii emission spectra in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "for example , phillips ( 1978a , 1978b ) discussed continuum pumping as one of the excitation mechanisms that are responsible for that emission . @xcite and",
    "@xcite calculated the strengths of 3407 feii emission lines assuming collisional excitation and continuum fluorescence of feii , with radiative transfer in the spectral lines treated in the first - order escape probability approximation .",
    "they found a good fit to the overall shape of feii features in the agn uv and optical spectra but recognized that the total strength of the feii emission is larger than the one predicted by the models by a factor of @xmath74 .",
    "other attemps made by @xcite to solve the apparent weakness of the feii emission using multi - component photoionization models were also unsuccessful .",
    "these failures point out that not all the excitation mechanisms have been taken into account or even that non - radiatively heated material with possibly even greater density exists within the blr .    in order to solve the feii problem , @xcite suggested ly@xmath3 flourescence as the main physical process involved in the production of feii lines .",
    "it takes advantage of the various near - coincidences between the wavelength of ly@xmath3 and the wavelengths corresponding to transitions between the levels of the @xmath11 term and the @xmath12 odd parity levels in feii , as described by @xcite . the largest calculated transition probabilities from the odd @xmath12 levels are those to @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and cascades from these levels to odd parity levels at 5 ev and then to @xmath15 and @xmath11 would produce the bulk of the feii spectrum located between 2000    and 3000   .",
    "model calculations including ly@xmath3 fluorescence as the excitation mechanism for the feii lines @xcite showed that this process is of fundamental importance in determining the strength of the feii emission .",
    "previously , feii features in the intervals 2400 - 2560    and 2830 - 2900    that originate from high excitation levels ( @xmath710 ev ) had been identified in the spectra of some agns @xcite , favouring the ly@xmath3 fluorescence scenario . the key feature to test this process , as predicted by @xcite , is significant feii emission in the wavelength range 8500 - 9500 , where the primary cascade lines from the upper @xmath12 levels to @xmath13 and @xmath14 are located . up to a few years ago ,",
    "that emission had been elusive to observe in agns although they are common features in the spectra of some galactic sources @xcite .    fortunately , sensitive nir spectroscopy carried out on agn samples during the last decade at moderate spectral resolution ( r@xmath7800 ) revealed a wealth of emission lines from feii in a previously unexplored wavelength region .",
    "for instance , @xcite , hereafter ra02 , identified for the first time in four nls1 galaxies ( ark564 , , and ) the strongest primary cascade lines of ly@xmath3 fluorescence predicted by @xcite . in addition , the secondary uv lines resulting from the decay of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 levels are also present in these objects .",
    "those results provided strong observational support to the hypothesis that ly@xmath3 fluorescence is , indeed , contributing to the emitted feii spectrum .",
    "furthermore , ra02 reports the presence of the so - called 1@xmath16 m feii lines ( feii @xmath179997 , @xmath1710501 , @xmath1710862 and @xmath1711126 ) .",
    "these are the most prominent feii features observed in the rest wavelength interval 0.8 - 2.4 @xmath16 m .",
    "the importance of that finding comes from the fact that nearly @xmath750% of the optical feii emission results from decays of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 levels , which are populated either by the transitions leading to the emission of the 1@xmath16 m lines and the secondary uv lines mentioned above , or by collisions from lower levels and direct photoionization .",
    "@xcite reported similar findings in a sample of 23 well - known broad - emission line agns .",
    "they also confronted , for the first time , @xcite theoretical predictions of the nir iron emission spectrum with observations .",
    "however , the prototypical izw1 was not included in their sample .    the only observation to date of izw1 in the nir",
    "was reported by @xcite , hereafter rmph .",
    "their work clearly reveals feii @xmath179997,@xmath1710501,@xmath1710862,@xmath1711126 .",
    "based on the absence of the crucial cascade lines that feed the common upper state where the 1  @xmath16 m feii lines originate ( assuming ly@xmath3 fluorescence as the dominant mechanism ) as well as the relatively low energy of that state , rmph suggest that the observed lines are collisionally excited . note , however , that no individual identification of the feii lines in the 8500 - 9300    interval has yet been done in izw1 .    for all said above",
    ", izw1 is a particularly good choice as a test target to construct a semi - empirical nir feii template as it is so well studied , especially in terms of its uv - optical iron emission .",
    "the strong and narrow feii emission lines in izw1 = -23.8 for @xmath20 = 50 km  s@xmath21  mpc@xmath21 , @xmath22 = 0 ) actually qualifies it as a low - luminosity quasar @xcite . ] , a conspicuous characteristic of nls1 galaxies , make it an ideal object for the construction of such a template and complements the ones previously published in both the uv @xcite and in the optical region @xcite .",
    "primary cascading lines following ly@xmath3 fluorescence , previously confirmed by ra02 and @xcite in other nls1s , can also be studied and characterized in this source .",
    "the main 1  @xmath16 m diagnostic lines have the advantage of not being heavily blended with other multiplets , as normally happens with the feii optical lines .",
    "the observation of such features in i  zw  1 can serve as a useful benchmark for photoionization models , in particular , for models predicting the complex feii emission spectrum .",
    "moreover , the proposed semi - empirical feii would allow the subtraction of this emission in other agns .",
    "this is important for at least two reasons : to decontaminate other blr features and to evaluate the amount of feii emission present in the nir region , along with its relationship to that of the uv and optical region .    in this paper",
    "we describe the first detailed work to study the feii lines emitted by the blr in izw1 .",
    "the aim is twofold : _",
    "( i ) _ provide tight observational constraints to model the feii emission in this source and _ ( ii ) _ construct the first semi - empirical template in the nir region .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : section 2 describes the observations and data reduction .",
    "section 3 discusses the characteristics of the theoretical models used in this work . in section 4",
    "we perform a template fitting to the observed spectrum of izw1 , using the theoretical models described in the former section .",
    "section 5 describes the construction of the semi - empirical feii template and tests it on the nir spectrum of ark564 . a general discussion and conclusions are given in sections 6 and 7 , respectively .",
    "near - infrared spectra of izw1 were obtained at the nasa 3 m infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) on the night of 23 october 2003 .",
    "the spex spectrograph ( rayner et al . 2003 ) was used in the short cross- dispersed mode ( sxd , 0.8 - 2.4 @xmath16 m ) .",
    "the detector employed consisted of a 1024@xmath231024 aladdin 3 insb array with a spatial scale of 0.15@xmath24/pixel .",
    "a @xmath25 slit oriented at the paralactic angle to minimize differential refraction was used , providing a spectral resolution of 360 kms@xmath21 .",
    "this value was determined both from the arc lamp and the sky line spectra and was found to be constant with wavelength along the observed spectra .    during the observations the seeing was @xmath71@xmath24 in j. observations",
    "were done nodding in an abba pattern with integration time of 120  s per frame and total on - source integration time of 28 minutes .",
    "after the galaxy , the a0v star sao  92128 ( v=7.38 ) was observed as telluric standard and flux calibrator .",
    "the spectral reduction , extraction and wavelength calibration procedures were performed using spextool @xcite , the in - house software developed and provided by the spex team for the irtf community .",
    "an aperture window 3@xmath24 wide was employed to integrate all the signal from the galaxy nucleus along the spatial direction .",
    "extended emission is likely to be present but it is outside the 3@xmath24 region .",
    "indeed , the fwhm of the izw1 light profile matches , within the natural seeing fluctuations during the observations , that of the telluric standard ( 0.91@xmath24 for the former and 0.89@xmath24 for the latter in the @xmath26-band ) .",
    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) of the dispersion solution for the wavelength calibration was 0.17 .",
    "the 1-d izw1 spectrum was then corrected for telluric absorption and flux calibrated using xtellcor @xcite , another in - house software developed by the irtf team .",
    "finally , the different orders of the galaxy spectrum were merged to form a single 1-d frame .",
    "it was later corrected for the redshift of @xmath27=0.061105 , determined from the average @xmath27 measured from the positions of pa@xmath28 , hei  1.083@xmath16 m , pa@xmath29 and br@xmath30 . a galactic extinction correction of e(b - v)=0.065 @xcite was applied .",
    "figure  [ izw1_irtf ] shows the final 1d spectrum of izw1 already calibrated by wavelength and flux .",
    "a visual comparison of our spex data with that of rmph reveals an improvement in the spectral resolution along the 0.8 - 2.2 @xmath16 m , allowing us to better constrain most spectral features , in particular , those that are heavily blended .",
    "moreover , the higher s / n ( @xmath31150 ) of our spectrum eases the identification of new emission features not detected before .",
    "it can also be seen that the continuum flux scale is about 30% lower in the @xmath32 and@xmath33 band and 50% lower in the @xmath26 band than that of rmph .",
    "this discrepancy is very likely due to the differences in apertures between the two observations , as our slit width is about 2.5@xmath23 narrower , and therefore encompassing a much smaller contribution of the host galaxy .",
    "the minimum in the continuum emission , at @xmath713000   is characteristic of agns and is interpreted as due to a shift from a nonthermal continuum to the thermal dust emission that dominates at longer wavelengths ( rmph ; ra02 ; riffel , rodrguez - ardila & pastoriza 2006 ; landt et al .",
    "note , however , that most line fluxes measured in our observation ( see table  [ tab : el ] ) agree within erros to that of rmph .",
    "line identifications for the most conspicuous lines detected in the nir spectrum of izw1 are indicated in figure  [ izw1_irtf ] .",
    "it is easy to see from figure  [ izw1_irtf ] that the nir spectrum of izw1 is rich in feii emission features .",
    "the so - called 1@xmath16 m feii lines , for instance , are particularly strong .",
    "significant feii emission in the 8500 - 9500  wavelength range , very likely produced by ly@xmath3 fluorescence as predicted by @xcite , is also observed .",
    "other prominent lines detected in izw1 include hi , hei , oi and caii . moreover , forbidden lines of [ feii ] , and [ siii ] and molecular h@xmath34 were also detected .    in the following sections we will discuss the method employed for the construction of the first semi - empirical nir feii template published in the literature , suitable to remove this emission in agns after a proper subtraction of the continuum emission and scaling/ line broadening of the template .",
    "theoretical models of feii including the nir region are rare in the literature . up to our knowledge , all works published before the year 1998",
    "( wills , netzer & wills 1985 and references therein ) predicted emission line intensities for the uv and optical regions only .",
    "the main reason for ignoring the nir is likely due to the fact that most model predictions pointed out to very weak feii emission in that region .",
    "moreover , the lack of good s / n observations of agns redwards of 8000    by that time prevented a confrontation between models and observations .",
    "@xcite proposed that the inclusion of ly@xmath3 fluorescence excitation process results in significant nir feii emission in the region 8500 - 9500   . in these calculations ,",
    "a limited , non - lte atomic model with 262 fine structure levels , sufficiently large for ly@xmath3 fluorescent excitation , was included .",
    "they showed that ly@xmath3 excitation can be of fundamental importance in enhancing the uv and optical feii fluxes .",
    "later , @xcite presented improved theoretical non - lte feii emission line strengths for physical conditions typical of active galactic nuclei with broad - line regions . in these new set of models ,",
    "updated to also include the mgii ion ( sigut , 2004 , private communication ) , the feii line strengths were computed with a precise treatment of radiative transfer using extensive and accurate atomic data from the iron projectnahar ] @xcite .",
    "excitation mechanisms for the feii emission included continuum fluorescence , collisional excitation , self - fluorescence among the feii transitions , and fluorescent excitation by ly@xmath3 and ly@xmath29 . a larger feii atomic model consisting of 827 fine structure levels ( including states to e@xmath715 ev ) was used to predict fluxes for approximately 23,000 feii transitions , covering most of the uv , optical , and nir wavelengths of astrophysical interest .",
    "detailed radiative transfer in the lines , including self - fluorescence overlap , was perfomed with an approximate @xmath35 operator scheme - see @xcite for details .    currently , owing to the complexity of the observed iron emission in agns , this emission is typically modeled using empirical templates derived from specific agn spectra @xcite .",
    "a more recent example of application of this method consisted in deriving a feii - iii template from high - quality uv spectra of the nls1 galaxy izw1 @xcite .",
    "such templates play a critical role in extracting a measure of the total iron emission from heavily blended and broadened agn emission line spectra . following this approach , and taking advantage of the availability of the feii templates and the nir spectrum of izw1",
    ", we will construct the first semi - empirical feii template of that galaxy , complementing the ones existing in the uv and optical regions .",
    "the approach that we will employ consists of comparing the nir spectrum of izw1 with a grid of feii+mgii models developed by sigut & pradhan ( 2003 ) , with these latter covering a wide range of ionization parameters ( @xmath36=-1.3 , -2 and -3 dex ) and densities ( @xmath37 = 9.6 , 10.6 , 11.6 and 12.6 dex @xmath6 ) .",
    "the internal cloud turbulent velocity , in all cases , was @xmath38=10  kms@xmath21 .",
    "feii+mgii spectra were computed for blr cloud models with typical conditions thought to exist in the feii emitting clouds .",
    "the calculations have been made for traditional clouds of a single specified density and ionization parameter , as opposed to the more realistic locally optimally emitting cloud models of @xcite , as the main interest is to study the interplay of the various iron emission excitation mechanisms and not the detailed structure of the blr .",
    "figure [ p2v ] shows the peak - to - valley intensity variability among the sigut & pradhan models versus wavelength .",
    "it shows a rather large variation in strength in some emission lines , such as those contained in the 8300 - 8500 and 9000 - 9400    intervals ( including a contribution from the mg emission ) , feii at 8927 , 9997 , 10502 , 10862 and 11126  , as well as mgii at 9218 and 9244  .",
    "indeed , the amplitude of the variation of these lines are about two orders of magnitude or more larger than the median peak - to - valley values .",
    "in order to estimate a nir template for izw1 a comparison of its observed emission line spectrum with that predicted by the available models was made .",
    "the best matching model can also indicate the most probable physical conditions of the blr . as a by - product of the template fitting",
    ", we also determined the emission line positions / intensities of other blr lines in order to minimize the residual rms .",
    "the whole fitting procedure is decribed below .",
    "the flux calibrated spectrum of izw1 was first continuum - subtracted in order to leave us with a pure emission line spectrum . for this purpose",
    ", a spline function was fitted to the continuum , choosing regions free of emission lines .",
    "the @xmath39 task of iraf was used for this purpose , and chosen for simplicity . a more elaborate approach ,",
    "consisting of a simultaneous fitting of the intrinsic agn continuum , stellar population template and dust is out from the scope of this paper .",
    "since the nir spectrum is very rich in emission lines other than feii , it is also necessary to model them and then perform a multi - parametric fit .",
    "the paschen series was modeled using , as a reference , the observed pa@xmath3 ( 1.8751  @xmath16 m ) profile in velocity space . in a first approach , we set the scaling factors of individual lines as free parameters in the fit .",
    "pa@xmath29 is located in a region of strong telluric contamination and , for that reason , was not considered .",
    "preliminary tests produced results without physical significance ( i.e. not justifiable by internal reddening and/or deviations of case b recombination rates ) .",
    "for that reason , we decided to set limits on the relative intensities of such lines consistent with decreasing values as moving towards the bluer part of the spectrum , starting from pa@xmath30 .",
    "this behavior was forced through the adoption of reasonable boundary conditions in the their scaling parameters . moreover ,",
    "pa@xmath40/pa@xmath41 line ratios in the 9000 - 12000    range were allowed to have a 20 - 30% error , given the uncertainties in subtracting the continuum .",
    "the permitted lines of caii@xmath178498,@xmath178542,@xmath178662 , hei@xmath1710830 , heii@xmath1710124 and oi@xmath178446,@xmath1711287 are also generally blended with the iron multiplets . as the bulk of all these lines",
    "is produced by the blr , they were also modeled through the pa@xmath3 profile , allowing some broadening ( by up to 80 kms@xmath21 using gaussian filtering ) to improve the results .",
    "the centroid position of hei and heii were found to be blueshifted by -332 and -622  kms@xmath21 , respectively .",
    "this may indicate that the largest contribution of these two lines is produced in the nlr , in agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "they report two regions emitting broad and blueshifted [ oiii ] lines in the optical region .",
    "one of the systems has v=-500",
    "kms@xmath21 , compatible to the line shift of the helium lines found here .",
    "the other system has v=-1450  kms@xmath21 .",
    "this latter is not detected here , very likely due to the lower spectral resolution of our data and its relative weakness compared to the strength of the other system .",
    "the fact that the iron line profiles do not appear asymmetric nor are significantly blueshifted indicates that this emission does not originate in the outflowing gas itself .",
    "this agrees with the results found by @xcite .",
    "forbidden lines present in this spectral region such as [ cai]@xmath179850 ( @xmath42213 kms@xmath21 ) , the highly excited [ sviii]@xmath179913 ( @xmath42 - 785 kms@xmath21 ) , [ siii]@xmath439069,9532 ( both with @xmath42 - 300 kms@xmath21 ) and [ sii]@xmath1710280,@xmath1710320 have all been assumed to have lorentzian profiles with widths of 600 kms@xmath21 .",
    "the blue shift found in most of these lines are compatible with the shift found by @xcite in the optical spectrum , confirming the presence of a complex nlr in this object .",
    "we have fixed the fwhm .",
    "] of the forbidden lines because we verified that by progressively increasing their fwhm the residual rms improved by clearly fitting through them also features of the feii models , a not desirable effect .",
    "also , the [ siii ] doublet at 9069 and 9532    were assumed to have their peak intensities constrained to the value of 2.4 ( [ siii]@xmath179532/[siii]@xmath179069 ) , as determined by atomic physics .",
    "the list of all modeled emission lines is shown in table [ tab : prof ] .",
    "our 12 available feii+mgii ( or simply the feii , when not considering the mgii lines ) theoretical templates had to be convolved with a line profile representative of the blr .",
    "for that purpose , it is useful to examine figure [ profoi ] , where the feii@xmath1711126 , oi@xmath1711287 and pa@xmath3 emission line profiles are plotted in the velocity space .",
    "it is easy to see that all three profiles can be well represented by a lorentzian function of fwhm = 875  kms@xmath21 ( dashed curve ) . for comparison",
    ", the figure also shows a gaussian profile ( dotted ) with the same fwhm as the lorentzian",
    ". clearly , the gaussian fails at reproducing the extense wings observed in both lines .",
    "because of the strong similarity of the blr profiles with the lorentzian curve , we adopted this theoretical profile to convolve our models . notice",
    "that this system would be equivalent to the relatively broad l1 system of @xcite , associated to the blr .",
    "although it may sound appealing to use the form and width of feii@xmath179997 or  @xmath1710491 + 10502 to broaden the templates , note that the former is heavily blended with pa@xmath28 ( narrow and broad components ) , [ sviii ] and [ ci ] , and the latter is a blend of two lines very close in wavelength",
    ". therefore , the characterization of these profiles are more subject to uncertainties . as shown above , the form and width of either feii@xmath1711126 or oi@xmath1711287 to broaden the feii+mgii template provides a similar result .",
    "this is consistent also with previous works @xcite that presented consistent observational and theoretical evidence , respectively , that both feii and oi are originated in the same parcel of gas .",
    "let each line intensity of a given feii+mgii ( or only feii ) template to be denoted by @xmath44 ( a @xmath28-function at @xmath45 ) and the lorentzian velocity profile to be given by @xmath46 .",
    "the flux @xmath47 at a certain wavelenght @xmath48 of the convolved template is then : @xmath49 with @xmath50\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the speed of light .",
    "the proportionality constant on equation [ eq : conv ] is a parameter of the fit .",
    "once defined all the emission line profiles , we proceeded with the least - squares fit of all scaling parameters ( 19 in total for each model , correponding to the lines listed in table  [ tab : prof ] plus the convolved template scaling factor ) .",
    "this was carried out using the fortran routines of the minuit v. 94.1 software , available at the cern library .",
    "the boundary conditions provided hi line ratios ( pa@xmath30/pa@xmath28 , pa@xmath28/pa8 , pa8/pa9 , pa9/pa10 ) with an average of @xmath71.7 , consistent with the theoretical paschen decrements within 20@xmath5230% error .",
    "note that the reduced-@xmath53 provided by the routine does not take into account possible sources of errors such as residuals from telluric absorption corrections and continuum subtraction .",
    "for this reason , we used the rms of the residuals as a measure for the quality of the fit .",
    "the residual rms obtained from the fit of each of the 12 models , calculated in the the main region of interest ( 8300@xmath5211600   ) , is shown in figure  [ rms ] .",
    "these results are used as a discriminant of the best suitable model .",
    "models with medium / low ionization parameters and large densities such as ( log  @xmath36=-2.0 , log  @xmath37=12.6 ) and ( log  @xmath36=-1.3 , log  @xmath37=12.6 ) are the most successful ones , having residual rms between 15 - 20% smaller with respect to the average ( around 30% smaller considering the worst models ) . for consistency , we decided to check the effect of the mgii emission in the fits .",
    "for this purpose , we performed the same fitting procedure using only the feii multiplets in the models .",
    "this approach is justified by the large uncertainties concerning the mgii strength in the models , specially in the spectral region of 9200   .",
    "the excitation mechanism for these mgii lines is ly@xmath29 fluorescence , and the uncertainties come from the small transition probabilities between the levels 3s @xmath54s @xmath1 5p @xmath54p@xmath55 .",
    "moreover , the pumping source function for ly@xmath29 is more uncertain than for ly@xmath3 due to the fact that photons in ly@xmath29 can also cycle through h@xmath3 , and this `` cross - redistribution '' can be important .    considering that the number of mgii lines included in the feii+mgii models is less than 1% of that of feii ,",
    "the exclusion of mgii does not affect significantly the fit , as expected .",
    "the rms values of the fit residuals considering only the feii multiplets are also shown in figure  [ rms ] as solid symbols .",
    "the results are very similar to those obtained using the composite feii+mgii models , favoring a high - density and moderate / low ionization parameter .",
    "another consistency check in the results was made considering only the 8300 - 11600     region in the fit , where the main feii diagnostic lines are located . in the above interval only pa@xmath30 to pa10 were included in the fit , reducing the number of free parameters to 18 .",
    "it turned out that either by fitting the larger 8300 - 20000    or just the 8300 - 11600    interval one obtains similar results .",
    "for this reason , and also because of the lack of significant feii+mgii emission redwards of 11600  , we will concentrate in the remainder of this paper to this smaller spectral region .",
    "figures [ pfit1 ] and [ pfit2 ] show the best fits for all the models .",
    "table [ tab : el ] lists the emission line intensities derived from such fits .",
    "in the previous section we found that the model with log  @xmath56=-2 and log  @xmath37=12.6 is the one that best represents the observed feii+mgii emission in izw1 . although not crucial at this point , it is important to question if that model is consistent with the physical conditions of a feii emission region believed to exist in agns .    @xcite computed purely collisional models showing that low temperature ( @xmath578000  k ) , high density ( @xmath58@xmath6 ) and high column density ( @xmath59(h)@xmath60  @xmath9 ) clouds provide feii@xmath61/h@xmath29 in good agreement with observations of seyfert  1 galaxies",
    ". detailed modeling of the feii using cloudy and including ly@xmath3 fluorescence as one of the excitation mechanisms made by @xcite points out to similar conditions .",
    "indeed , densities between 9  @xmath62 and log  @xmath36=-1.4 are consistent with observations .",
    "additional observational evidence that strong iron ( feii and feiii ) emission may be connected with high densities was provided by @xcite and @xcite . from",
    "that we can see that the physical conditions of the best matching model for izw1 are , in general terms , representative of the feii emitting region in agns .    in the remainder of this section",
    "we analyze in detail the best feii+mgii template and propose modifications to it , based on the mismatches between the observed spectrum and the convolved model .",
    "we then present a semi - empirical template capable of minimizing the residual rms in the nir window of 8300 - 11600    for izw1 .",
    "the equation [ eq : conv ] for the convolution of a given model can be succinctly rewritten in a matricial form : @xmath63    where @xmath64 denotes a spectrum , the n - length vector of feii+mgii fluxes for a given wavelength range , @xmath65 the n@xmath23 m convolution matrix and @xmath66 the m - length vector with the set of feii and mgii line intensities which contribute to the wavelength range comprised by @xmath64 . neglecting any measurement errors",
    ", we can estimate @xmath64 from the residuals of the observed spectrum after the subtraction of all emission lines ( except feii and mgii ) , which we call hereafter @xmath67 .",
    "the convolution matrix can be easily built from the lorentzian velocity profile ( fwhm=875 km s@xmath68 ) and the @xmath69 differences between each given multiplet line @xmath70 and the wavelength which corresponds to @xmath47 .",
    "adjusting the template line intensities to match as close as possible the observed residuals then constitutes a deconvolution problem , for which several solving approaches exist ( see , for instance , a discussion on deconvolution techniques in thibaut 2005 ) .",
    "the number of feii+mgii lines comprised between 8300 and 11600     are 1529 , out of which only a few contribute significantly to the emission spectrum .",
    "the wiener deconvolution was chosen for our problem for its simplicity .",
    "however , it can lead to an unrealistic overdensity of line contributions , along with some unphysical results , if we consider all of the 1529 line intensities as free parameters . for this reason",
    ", we have decided to build a @xmath71 vector containing only the contribution of multiplets with the @xmath723% largest intensity contributions ( selected from the best fitted model ) , plus some others whose intensities are clearly underestimated in the models ( e.g. the unusual two - peaked bump around 11400  ; see discussion below ) . in practice , this means zeroing the elements in the @xmath66 vector ( to be multiplied by @xmath65 ) which fall outside the selection criteria .",
    "the intensity threshold for building @xmath71 lies at about 4% of the peak intensity in this wavelength range , and it is at least twice higher than the template median intensity .",
    "this criterium produces a @xmath71 with 51 elements .    in order to account for the spectral contribution of the feii+mgii multiplets not present in the @xmath71 vector , which we call hereafter the `` background '' spectrum @xmath73",
    ", we first subtract their emission is obtained by convolving the low intensity lines selected from the best model with the lorentzian profile . ] from the input spectrum .",
    "this allows us to rewrite equation ( [ eq : conv2 ] ) as : @xmath74 note that @xmath73 is scaled accordingly to the fitted parameter of feii+mgii found in the previous section .",
    "the line intensities in the vector @xmath71 found from the deconvolution of @xmath75 plus the `` background '' subset of line intensities provide what we call the semi - empirical feii+mgii template .    a quick test used as @xmath67 a spectrum produced by convolving our best model , which we called @xmath76 .",
    "the deconvolution technique described above was then applied to check whether we could reliably recover the original @xmath71 , and consequently @xmath66 .",
    "convolving this `` deconvolved '' vector then produced @xmath77 .",
    "the difference of this latter with @xmath76 showed a rms of less than 2% ( relative to the intensity at 9997  ) .",
    "the reliability of this result is also shown in figure  [ fig : dec ] , where the initial normalized model intensities ( @xmath78 ) are plotted against the ones found from the deconvolution ( @xmath79 ) . despite of some scattering , specially for the less intense lines , the agreement is very good .    when tackling real data , we decided to make a small tuning to the @xmath71 vector . in order to conserve the physical interpretation given by the best model ( -2.0,12.6 ) with predictions about the intensities of the most prominent feii lines , we decided to discard them from the @xmath71 vector . in practice",
    "this means that feii@xmath179997,@xmath1710501,@xmath1710862 , @xmath1711126 ( and the close neighbors feii@xmath1710491,@xmath1710871 ) had their original values preserved , and have been included in the @xmath73 contribution .",
    "we should also make a brief remark on the relatively strong two - peaked bump of feii observed at @xmath711400   : this feature is underpredicted by any of the models , and because of its strength , we ruled out the possibility of being part of the spectrum noise or a feature introduced by the oi@xmath1711287 profile fitting .",
    "telluric absorption corrections are not critical in this region and , besides that , in the model templates one can notice two small peaks around this region , not exactly coincident in wavelength with the observed ones .",
    "these arguments give us support to believe that these features , located around 11381 and 11402  , are real .",
    "notice that these wavelengths , estimated by visual inspection , are close to 11380.32 and 11403.54 , which refer to features that appear in absorption in the models .",
    "we decided to include these two hypothetical lines in the @xmath71 vector , as well as those around 10686   , clearly underestimated in the models but visible in @xmath75 .",
    "this left us with a final 50-element @xmath71 vector .",
    "we then applied the deconvolution to the observed spectrum ( after the @xmath73 subtraction ) .",
    "the intensities obtained from the deconvolution method applied to the observed feii+mgii izw1 spectrum are shown in table [ tab : dec ] together with those given by the best model .",
    "these values are all normalized with respect to the intensity of the feii@xmath179997 line . for building the semi - empirical feii+mgii spectrum we convolved this newly derived intensity vector with the @xmath65 matrix and added back the background contribution .    the total semi - empirical template ( corresponding to @xmath66 , according to our notation ) in the region of interest ( 0.83 - 1.16 @xmath16 m ) is shown in figure [ fig : template ] , on top .",
    "the bottom panel shows an expanded view ( @xmath2325 ) of the template , in order to highlight the contribution of the less intense lines .",
    "figure [ fig : obs_dec ] shows the resulting semi - empirical spectrum ( bottom ) , as well as the one derived from best model ( top ) , for comparison , superposed on the observed feii+mgii spectrum of izw1 .",
    "the semi - empirical template reduces by @xmath731% the rms of the observed spectrum with respect to the best model .",
    "the bottom figure also indicates the lines whose estimated intensities varied more significantly with respect to those given by the model . notice that negative intensities obtained from the deconvolution process have been zeroed in the computation of the estimated spectrum , but are shown in table [ tab : dec ] for completion .",
    "such negative line intensities are consistent with zero within 2@xmath80 of the spectral residuals .",
    "@xcite [ see their section 5.4.1 . ]",
    "have compared the predicted feii model of @xcite to observations and found a discrepancy in the the feii1.0491 + 1.0502  @xmath16 m and feii1.0174@xmath16 m emission lines , in the sense that the former were overpredicted whereas the latter were underpredicted by theory , and this by a similar factor of @xmath72 .",
    "note that they used the predictions of model a of @xcite with log@xmath36=-2 and log@xmath37=9.6 .",
    "our best matching model has the same ionization parameter but a density that is three orders of magnitude larger ( log@xmath37=12.6 ) .",
    "as can be seen in table  [ tab : el ] and figures  [ pfit1 ] and  [ pfit2 ] , our best model leads to a better fit of the most conspicuous lines including feii1.0491 + 1.0502  @xmath16 m .",
    "indeed , the discrepancy is removed in this pair of emission lines .",
    "feii1.0174@xmath16 m , on the other hand , continues to be underpredicted even in the best model .",
    "actually , this was one of the iron features that needed a fine tuning : its strength increased in the semi - empirical template by a factor of almost 3 ( see figure  [ fig : izw1_final ] , when a comparison between the model and the semi - empirical template is done ) . very likely , atomic parameters for that line would need to be reviewed in future modeling .",
    "ark564 is another well - known nls1 with strong feii emission , suitable to test our semi - empirical template .",
    "the spectrum of this agn was observed and reduced in a similar way to that of of izw1 .",
    "details of the extraction , reduction , wavelength and flux calibration are in @xcite . as previously , we fitted and subtracted the continuum emission through a spline function .",
    "for modeling the line profiles , we adopted pa@xmath3 as representative of the emission line profile to be convolved with the feii+mgii intensity vector derived from izw1 , and also as a template for other permitted emission lines .",
    "forbidden lines were assumed to have gaussian profiles with widths of 500 - 550 km  s@xmath21 .",
    "a quick fit over all the theoretical models also indicates a very high density and low / moderate ionization parameter for the feii emitting region , as shown in table [ tab : akn564 ] with the estimated rms over the 8300 - 11600    region .",
    "the sharpness of the emission lines makes small uncertainties in emission line positioning and scaling to give rise to high amplitude residuals in the fit , what explains the larger observed residual rms .",
    "neverthless , the general trend is similar to that observed for izw1 , favoring similar physical conditions for the feii emitting region .",
    "figure [ fig : akn564 ] is similar to figure [ fig : obs_dec ] , but now showing the suitability of our derived semi - empirical template to the observed feii+mgii emission of ark564 .",
    "a smaller rms in the residuals with respect to those obtained from the theoretical models confirms the usefulness of the semi - empirical template to represent the feii and mgii emission in agns . in general , lines that needed a fine tuning in izw1 , like feii10174  ,",
    "properly reproduce the observations .",
    "note , however , that the bump observed at 11400    in izw1 and that we deliberately introduced in the template seems to be unusually large with respect to the one in ark564 .",
    "clearly , the transitions leading to these particular set of lines should strongly depend on local physical parameters that vary from object to object .",
    "the analysis carried out in the previous sections confirms several pieces of evidence already suggested by other works , which are : _ ( i ) _",
    "ly@xmath3 fluorescence is indeed a process that should be taken into account in any systematic study of the feii emission in agns as it produces a considerable amount of emission lines that otherwise would be absent .",
    "this is particularly evident for the 9200    feature , composed of numerous feii multiples as well as some contribution from mgii lines . _",
    "( ii ) _ similarly to the optical region , the nir feii emission also produces a subtle pseudo - continuum , particularly in the region between 8600 and 10000     ( see figure  [ fig : template ] ) . without a proper modeling and subtraction of this emission",
    ", fluxes of other blr and nlr features can be severely overestimated .",
    "_ ( 3 ) _ unlike in the optical region , individual feii emission lines can be isolated in the nir ( i.e. , the lines at 10501   , 10862    and 11126   ) .",
    "this is particularly useful to characterize , for instance , the line profiles and emission line fluxes , in an already complex emission region .",
    "this individual feii line charaterization can be possible because other feii lines very close in wavelength to the above three are at least 25@xmath23 weaker .",
    "the above thoughts can better be visualized in figure  [ fig : izw1_final ] , which shows the spectrum of izw1 with ( top ) and without ( bottom ) the feii+mgii contribution .",
    "the spectrum `` clean '' of iron and magnesium emission highlights the remaining emission lines , properly identified in the figure .",
    "small spikes , coincident with the position of the strongest feii lines can still be seen as , for example , in the blue part of pa@xmath28 , between hei and pa@xmath30 and at the position of the feii@xmath1711126 line .",
    "we interpret these small residuals as a due to emission from the nlr , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "it might indicate that a more complex modeling of the convolving profile might be required , for example , by including a possible contribution from the nlr .",
    "however , because we are primarily interested in the construction of a semi - empirical template for the feii+mgii emission which originates at the blr , these small residuals are out of concern .",
    "figure [ fig : ark564_final ] shows the same as figure [ fig : izw1_final ] but for ark564 .",
    "it can be seen that the spectrum at the bottom is nicely clean of feii and mgii , as evidenced by the small residuals left in the region between 10200 - 10600   .",
    "it exemplifies the use of our nir izw1 template to remove that emission in other agns .    at this point",
    "we call the attention to an apparent absorption feature blueward of hei@xmath1710818 that appeared after the subtraction of the feii+mgii semi - empirical template in ark564 .",
    "it is possible that this feature is artificial and due to a bad subtraction of the feii blends with peak at 10750 .",
    "yet another possibility is that it could be a real feature , similar to the one reported by @xcite in the quasar , which they attribute to a broad absorption line ( bal ) system in that source .",
    "@xcite discussed the prospects of finding other hei@xmath1710830 balqsos on six additional objects and pointed out that several well - known , bright low - redshift balqsos have no hei@xmath1710830 absorption , a fact that can place upper limits on the column densities in those objects .",
    "observations with higher spectral resolution are needed to confirm if the absorption in ark564 is indeed real .",
    "although it is out of the scope of this paper the study of such a system of absorbers in the blr of ark564 or in other sources , our results strengthen the need of an adequate feii subtraction around hei@xmath1710830 to further constrain the inner physical properties of such agns .",
    "note also that the peak observed around 10740     is due to [ fexiii ] emission .",
    "in addition , the 11400    bump is overestimated in the semi - empirical template , meaning that some particular lines may need a fine tuning for a better match .",
    "it implies also that not all nir feii lines may scale up by the same factor , as would be expected .",
    "however , as in the optical and uv regions , the semi - empirical template suitably reproduces most of the observed feii+mgii emission features in the nir .",
    "clearly , testing the template in a large number of objects is necessary to verify its suitability in more general terms .    at this point",
    "is important to draw our attention to how significant is the nir feii emission in izw1 compared to that of the optical and uv . for this purpose",
    "we measured the integrated flux in the 8300@xmath5211600    region using the feii semi - empirical template derived for that object .",
    "we found that f@xmath81  erg@xmath9s@xmath21 .",
    "note that the mgii was not taken into account in the computed value .",
    "@xcite measured the integrated flux of feii for izw1 using hst and ground - based observations of this galaxy in five different wavelength bands : @xmath561 [ 2200 - 2660   ] , @xmath562 [ 2660 - 3000   ] , @xmath563 [ 3000 - 3500   ] , @xmath821 [ 4400 - 4700   ] and @xmath822 [ 5100 - 5600   ] . the values they found , relative to h@xmath29 , are shown in table  [ tab : fe2flux ] .",
    "it can be seen that nearly half the amount of h@xmath29 flux in izw1 is emitted by feii in the nir .",
    "moreover , the integrated nir iron emission carries a flux that is equivalent to @xmath710% of the feii emission in the optical region ( sum of the fluxes in the @xmath821 and @xmath822 intervals of table  [ tab : fe2flux ] ) , to @xmath710% of the feii in the near - uv region ( 3000 - 3500   ) and to @xmath73% of the feii emission in the uv ( 2200 - 3000   ) .    at first sight",
    "the above numbers may indicate that the role of ly@xmath3 pumping , which is behind most of the feii nir emission , is negligible .",
    "however , we should take into account that after the cascading transitions that result in the nir emission the z  @xmath83d and z  @xmath83f levels are populated .",
    "these latter are responsible for part of the transitions leading to the feii emission in the @xmath821 and @xmath822 optical regions .",
    "therefore , a 10% in flux means that up to 20% of the optical feii photons can be attributed to ly@xmath3 fluorescence .",
    "we have compared theoretical models for the feii+mgii nir emission in active galaxies , which have the same turbulent velocities in the medium , but differ in physical conditions such as density and degree of ionization of the emitting region . for that purpose , we chose to model the nls1 galaxy izw1 , which has traditionally provided the template for the feii emission in the optical and uv .    the best match among all models was obtained by comparing the results of a multi - parametric fit comprising the main emission line features to the observed spectrum in the region 0.83 - 1.16 @xmath16 m .",
    "low / moderate ionization parameters and high gas densities of 10@xmath84  @xmath6 ) are favored , as they reduce the residuals of the fitted spectrum . however , since some feii lines are clearly underestimated even by the best models , we decided to derive a semi - empirical template to improve the fitting , by adjusting the intensities of the most prominent feii and mgii lines , taken from the best fitted model .",
    "the newly derived template reduces the fit residuals by about 31% with respect to what is obtained using the best theoretical model .",
    "we performed a quick check on the spectrum of another nls1 with conspicuous and very narrow emission lines , ark564 . despite some small differences , this test corroborated the reliability of this new semi - empirical template to reproduce agn feii and mgii emission lines in the nir .",
    "we also highlight that the feii bump around 11400   which we introduced to match the observed spectrum of izw1 does not reproduce well the same observed feature of ark564 .",
    "this lead us to the conclusion that this emission is abnormal in izw1 , given that none of the models too could predict such a large emission . also , izw1 might contain a narrow contribution to the feii spectrum , as suggested in an optical study of @xcite .",
    "further tests will be futurely carried out on a larger sample , in order to fine tune our derived template .",

    "<S> the most recent models by @xcite include details of the feii ion microphysics and cover a wide range in ionization parameter @xmath0= ( -3.0  @xmath1  -1.3 ) and density @xmath2 = ( 9.6  @xmath1  12.6 ) . with the aid of such models and a spectral synthesis approach , we study for the first time in detail the nir emission of izw1 . </S>",
    "<S> the main goals are to confirm the role played by ly@xmath3 fluorescence mechanisms in the production of the feii spectrum and to construct the first semi - empirical nir feii template that best represents this emission and can be used to subtract it in other sources . a good overall match between the observed feii+mgii features with those predicted by the best fitted model </S>",
    "<S> is obtained , corroborating the ly@xmath3 fluorescence as a key process to understand the feii spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the best model is then adjusted by applying a deconvolution method on the observed feii+mgii spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the derived semi - empirical template is then fitted to the spectrum of ark564 , suitably reproducing its observed feii+mgii emission . </S>",
    "<S> our approach extends the current set of available feii templates into the nir region . </S>"
