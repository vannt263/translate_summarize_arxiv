    "a very promising and challenging experiment to be performed in the near future using coherent matter waves is the observation of a rotation - induced supercurrent around a closed loop .",
    "this not only will attract a broad interest from the point of view of fundamental physics as a direct manifestation of superfluidity  @xcite , but may also open the way to new kinds of high - precision rotation sensors based on matter - wave  @xcite , rather than light - wave  @xcite interferometry .",
    "the irrotationality constraint of superfluids is in fact softened in the multiply connected geometry of a closed loop waveguide , which then appears as an ideal playground for the study of quantized vorticity and the related quantum interference phenomena .",
    "as it has been originally pointed out by bloch @xcite , and then developed in more detail by ueda and co - workers @xcite , an appropriately tailored rotating potential can be used to transfer vorticity into a bose - einstein condensate trapped in a closed loop geometry .",
    "the 2d numerical simulations reported in  @xcite , which fully include the effect of interactions , have demonstrated a close qualitative analogy between the physics of rotating condensates and the physics of condensates in 1d optical lattices , an analogy that can be made quantitative by correctly taking into account the modifications to the trapping potential due to rotation .",
    "metastability appears for a rotating flux as a consequence of flux quantization : points of vanishing density have in fact to be introduced in the wavefunction if quantized vortices are to penetrate or exit the cloud @xcite .",
    "when the velocity of the superfluid flow exceeds the velocity of sound , the system becomes energetically unstable according to the landau criterion of superfluidity . in this regime ,",
    "the interaction of the flowing fluid with a stationary defect is able to create excitations in the fluid , which can eventually lead to dissipation of the supercurrent by means of phase slippage processes  @xcite .    in order to simplify the theoretical study of the generation and dynamics of supercurrents in realistic loop configurations (",
    "e.g. a toroidal trap ) , it is very convenient to be able to isolate the longitudinal dynamics along the , possibly rotating , waveguide so to reduce the full 3d problem to 1d .",
    "this is one of the central points of the present paper .",
    "once the 3d problem is reduced to a 1d one , the formal connection between annular rotating bose - einstein condensates and bose - einstein condensates in optical lattices becomes apparent , and one can start taking fully advantage of the large amount of literature appeared on the latter subject .",
    "a remarkable example of this connection are the so - called swallow tails ( instable parts of the band structure at the edge and in the centre of the brillouin zone ) shown by the band structure of a bec flowing in an optical lattice @xcite : as it has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , they play an important role in the nucleation of vortices and supercurrents in rotating becs . further very interesting phenomena that have been studied in the context of becs in optical lattices are dynamical instabilities @xcite and gap solitons @xcite , which are expected to have interesting counterparts in the physics of rotating becs .",
    "first observations  @xcite of bose - einstein condensates trapped in toroidal traps have been recently reported in refs .",
    "these experimental setups were based on magnetic potential , which introduces some limitations on the geometries that can be obtained and , more specifically , on the flexibility of the setup with respect to time and space modulations of the confining potential .",
    "the other central point of our paper is in fact to propose a novel realization of toroidal atomic waveguide , that makes use of the attractive optical potential of a red - detuned laser beam as an optical tweezer  @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of our proposal with respect to recent related ones  @xcite is the flexibility of the setup .",
    "a toroidal trapping potential with a strong transverse confinement is obtained by rapidly moving the focus point of the laser . as the trajectory of the focus point",
    "can be arbitrarily chosen , as well as its speed of motion , any shape can in principle be obtained for the 1d waveguide , and any longitudinal potential can be applied onto the atoms in addition to the transverse confinement .",
    "furthermore , the shape of the curve can be changed in time , so to obtain , e.g. , rotating waveguide traps .",

    "the @xmath114-fold modulation of the potential along the waveguide allows only mixing of states at circulation @xmath127 with states at circulation @xmath131 , in correspondence of the sub - band gaps .",
    "hence , following adiabatically a given sub - band by very slowly increasing ( or decreasing ) the rotation frequency , one can transform a state at a given circulation @xmath127 into a state at circulation @xmath131 .",
    "a possible way of achieving experimentally an annular condensate with strong transverse confinement is to use a magnetic toroidal trap , as reported in  @xcite . in this section",
    ", a completely different experimental configuration is proposed , and its advantages pointed out . for the sake of simplicity , we shall concentrate our attention to the most relevant case of a planar waveguide whose axis lays on the horizontal @xmath132 plane .",
    "a strong confinement in the vertical @xmath133 direction can be obtained using a horizontal light sheet which provides a potential @xmath134 , while the curvilinear waveguide profile can be created by rapidly moving the focus point of a red - detuned laser beam ( acting as an optical tweezer  @xcite ) along the curve @xmath0 , at a , possibly time - dependent speed @xmath135 .",
    "this can be obtained e.g. by reflecting the laser light onto vibrating mirrors or using acousto - optic modulators .",

    "the main advantage of this method over the magnetic traps studied e.g. in  @xcite is that any shape of the curve @xmath0 can be obtained without any additional difficulty , and this can also be modified in the course of the experiment in order to obtain e.g. a rotating waveguide .",
    "another important requirement for the study of supercurrent to be possible is that the longitudinal potentials are not strong enough to fragment the condensate . as an example , it is interesting to estimate the effect of a tilting of the light sheet that is used to vertically confine the atoms . for a tilting angle @xmath153 from the horizontal ,",
    "the potential energy difference at the extrema of the waveguide due to gravity is equal to @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the gravity field acceleration and @xmath156 is the horizontal distance between opposite points of the waveguide . within the thomas - fermi approximation",
    ", fragmentation occurs if the gravitational energy difference is larger than the mean - field interaction energy , that is if    @xmath157    for a system of @xmath158 atoms of @xmath159rb with scattering length @xmath160 nm in a waveguide of radius @xmath161 m and @xmath162 m , the system remain connected provided @xmath163 , which is a rather stringent but not unreachable experimental requirement .",
    "note that the gravitational potential does not rotate with the waveguide when this is set into rotation , so that it might possibly act as a defect moving through the one - dimensional fluid  @xcite .    in the case of very tight confinement and frozen transverse dynamics",
    "the issue of phase fluctuations in the 1d condensate comes into play .",
    "we believe that the rotational properties of the condensate should not however be disturbed at least in the meanfield regime at low enough temperature .",
    "another issue of great importance from the experimental point of view is the possibility of measuring the number of vorticity quanta present around the annular condensate .",
    "a measurement after expansion has been recently predicted to be able to provide a clear answer  @xcite , but a non - destructive measurement would be preferable in view of applications as a rotation sensor . in the case of a rotating non - circular ( e.g. , elliptical ) waveguide , the deformation of the periodic density modulation due to the centrifugal potential should in principle provide a way of measuring the supercurrent .",
    "if this signal is too weak to be detected , one could still resort to other techniques , e.g. the analysis of collective modes  @xcite or the measurement of the momentum distribution by means of bragg spectroscopy  @xcite or slow - light imaging  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have developed a formalism which is able to reduce the three - dimensional problem of atomic propagation along an atomic waveguide to one - dimensional equations . under a strong transverse confinement hypothesis ,",
    "the transverse extension of the wavefunction is much smaller than the curvature radius of the waveguide and the wavefunction can be factorized into the product of its longitudinal and transverse parts .",
    "our formalism is then applied to a novel concept of optical waveguide which combines the possibility of having a strong confinement with a great flexibility in the design of the , possibly rotating , waveguide shape .",
    "such a description provides a simple yet accurate starting point for analytical studies and numerical simulations , as well as for the design of experimental setups .",
    "our framework is in fact able to considerably simplify the theoretical analysis while still keeping track of the relevant degrees of freedom in a quantitative way .",
    "possible applications range from the determination of the best experimental sequence to nucleate a supercurrent along a ring - shaped bose - einstein condensate , to the study of the response to a global rotation in a sort of matter - wave gyroscope .    stimulating discussions with c. tozzo and f. dalfovo",

    "<S> we propose a general procedure for reducing the three - dimensional schrdinger equation for atoms moving along a strongly confining atomic waveguide to an effective one - dimensional equation . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure is applied to the case of a rotating closed - loop waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of including mean - field atomic interactions is presented . </S>",
    "<S> application of the general theory to characterize a new concept of atomic waveguide based on optical tweezers is finally discussed . </S>"
