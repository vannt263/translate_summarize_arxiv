    "one of main problems in subnuclear physics concerns the structure and interactions of hadrons in terms of their elementary quark and gluon constituents .",

    "phenomenologically are nuclear forces understood in terms of meson exchanges .",
    "their long range component , for the first time introduced by yukawa @xcite , is generated by a pion exchange .",
    "the intermediate range attraction between two - nucleons can be understood in terms of a correlated two pion exchange , usually simulated by a scalar - isoscalar @xmath3 meson .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the microscopic interpretation of the nn scattering data has mostly rested upon the various nonrelativistic quark models @xcite . to preserve the relativistic invariance of the microscopic interpretation , however , one has another possibility , to use the qcd motivated , quantum field theory based models , see , e.g. , refs .",

    "we investigate a possibility to understand the nn scattering problem starting from a relativistically invariant quark confinement model ( qcm ) developed at dubna by efimov , ivanov and one of us ( v.l . )",
    "constructing an obe model of nuclear forces , we use our predictions of meson - nucleon coupling constants that we obtain within the qcm .",
    "the form factors we treat but as is usual in a conventional interpretation scheme @xcite , i.e. , we choose their cutoffs to fit the nn phase shifts .",
    "this is justified because of the medium renormalization of the meson and nucleon parameters , see , e.g. ref .",

    "it is widely accepted @xcite that conventional one - boson exchange model of the nn forces is capable to describe the scattering observables .",
    "the nn forces are then given as a sum of the contributions of relevant mesons .",

    "as the quark confinement model had been developed at refs .",
    "@xcite , we only briefly review it here . the meson - nucleon ( in general the meson - baryon ) interaction vertex is within the quark model represented by the feynman diagram shown in fig .",

    "will then be redrawn to that one shown in fig .",

    "the chosen set of the reference hadronic processes and the resulting qcm values are shown in table [ reference ] together with the reference empirical data .",
    "these results have been obtained with the qcm parameters , which are shown in table [ qcmpar ] .",
    "the obtained parameter set have been used to predict numerous characteristics of hadrons and hadronic processes as magnetic moments of baryons , weak coupling constants , and various decay widths with rather good results in ref .",
    "@xcite . that work is in fact a reinvestigation of the same physics as has been studied in the paper @xcite using but different  the constant - mass form of the diquark propagator .",
    "the application of such form of the diquark propagator has been motivated by the success of the bottom mesons decay studies , where for a heavy - quark propagator the constant - mass propagator has been used .    as one can see in refs .",
    "@xcite generally good assessments of the strong , electromagnetic , and weak interactions controlled processes have been acquired within the qcm .",
    "it should be said further that after preceding steps we have the effective quark field theory without _",
    "free parameters_. within this frame we can calculate the meson - nucleon coupling constants without additional free parameters too .",
    "despite of the fact that the one - boson exchange model is a simplified representation of the nn forces , the effectiveness of this approach is at least at low energies established , see , e.g. ref .",
    "the strong intermediate range attraction and the strong short range repulsion bring , however , some questions concerning their microscopic understanding . within obe models are these nn force properties described by using the @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons , to describe the attractive and repulsive forces , respectively @xcite .",
    "many studies have been devoted to elaborate understanding of the intermediate range attraction .",
    "the studies performed with dispersion relation techniques conclude @xcite that a major part of this attraction arises from the correlated two - pion exchanges , which are in turn well approximated by the exchange of the @xmath3 meson .",
    "the similar results have been obtained in the field - theoretical approach of ref .",
    "@xcite and by bonn group @xcite within their full meson exchange model .",
    "there are also other papers , which have studied the intermediate range attraction in a more microscopic way .",
    "thus , using the soliton model kaiser and meissner have shown that the inclusion of the pion loops gives the intermediate range attraction with the strength compared to the paris potential @xcite .",
    "the new information arises also from a development by weinberg @xcite and others @xcite , who have recently use a chiral perturbation theory to study the nature of the nn forces . a satisfying qualitative feature , which they have found shows that the uncorrelated two - pion exchange with some of the higher order contact terms provide the intermediate range attraction too . for discussion of the @xmath3 meson itself see also very recent development by the brooklyn group @xcite . other treatments of low - lying scalar mesons",
    "can be find also in @xcite .",
    "it was known for a long time that the short range repulsive force produced by the @xmath4 meson exchange partially simulates forces originating from the quark and gluon exchange processes and from heavier vector and tesor meson exchanges also .",
    "the understanding of these processes advanced recently also .",
    "a qualitative understanding of the short range part of the nn forces has been obtained as produced by the one - gluon exchange in the resonating - group method based quark model @xcite , or as a  van der waals repulsion \" in the chiral bag language @xcite . in a more refined model version @xcite not only gluons but also goldstone pions are exchanged between quarks .",
    "their exchange immediately followed by a quark pair exchange add further short range repulsion revealing thus abundance of structures behind the effective obep s @xmath4 exchange . as have been discussed @xcite such calculations can easily accommodate a repulsive @xmath4 exchange using the @xmath4nn coupling compatible with the su(3 ) value .",
    "one can see from this discussion that within obe models we use at least two - mesons , the exchange of which simulate the more complex exchanges too .",
    "consequently , the couplings of these effective exchange fields differ from the couplings of the elementary processes and also from that ones calculated within the qcd structure level based models . bearing this in mind",
    ", we can go on to discuss our results .",
    "the empirical findings show that to describe the low energy nn scattering the pseudoscalar , vector , and scalar meson fields are necessary to generate the exchange forces @xcite . to be consistent within the quark model framework we should consider the mesons constructed from the @xmath90 quarks .",
    "thus , in the present paper , we take as a set of exchanged mesonic fields the su(3 ) pseudoscalar , vector , and scalar mesons . accordingly , our set of the mesonic fields consists of the @xmath0 pseudoscalars , the @xmath1 vectors , and the @xmath91 scalar meson fields .",
    "furthermore , we consider the scalar - isoscalar @xmath92 meson also .",
    "the @xmath93 meson we do not include in this work because of its coupling constant .",
    "the present parameterization of the qcm predicts it to be very small , of about 0.2 .",
    "the @xmath94 meson we should include to be consistent from the quark model point of view , where @xmath95 and @xmath94 are formed in pseudoscalar octet - singlet mixing @xcite .",
    "the qcm predictions of the meson - nucleon coupling constants , are shown in table [ obep ] .",
    "some of these coupling constants are connected by the su(3 ) symmetry relations .",
    "these are , the vector couplings for the @xmath6 and @xmath4 vector mesons .",
    "further , the ratio of the vector meson pauli to dirac coupling constant are @xmath96 and @xmath97 .      the construction of our obe qrba9 ( quark relativistic bosons version a with 9 exchanged fields ) model we start out from our qcm predictions of the meson - nucleon coupling constants and typical cutoff masses @xcite of the phenomenological form factors ( [ ff ] ) . because of the above specified reasons , which are connected with the effectiveness of @xmath3 and @xmath4 exchanges , we first optimize the @xmath3nn and @xmath4nn coupling constants .",
    "afterward , we include to optimization process also the form factor cutoff masses .",
    "parameters of the resulting qrba9 obe model are also shown in table [ obep ] .    concerning the parameter determination procedure",
    "the following should be said .",
    "as the empirical data we take the phase shift values obtained by arndt and collaborators @xcite .",
    "the fitting we span over up to 450 mev of the nucleon laboratory energy . from a physical viewpoint",
    "this may be done because the imaginary parts of the phase shifts in all partial waves are small , except the @xmath98 and @xmath99 waves , in this energy region @xcite .",
    "our phase shifts are shown in figs .",
    "they are compared there to empirical data and to a phenomenological fit .",
    "the referred empirical data are that ones , which we use in our fitting procedure @xcite .",
    "the results of the mentioned phenomenological fit we calculate from the bonn obep(b ) model @xcite , commonly regarded as a standard one .",
    "note that this obe model is affirmed to 325 mev of the laboratory energy .",
    "as seen , our predictions agree well with the empirical data .",
    "to quantify this statement we can say that the ratio of the @xmath5 criteria , which we obtain with the qrba9 model , to that one , we obtain with the bonn obep(b ) model @xcite , is 1.23 .",
    "note that because of the coupling to the isobar channel , which is , as it has been shown by lomon @xcite , responsible for the resonant behaviour of the @xmath98 and @xmath99 phase shifts , we do not show these phase shifts here ( taking them into account the mentioned @xmath5 ratio will be 1.80 ) .",
    "regarding the phase shifts we would like to comment on the behaviour of the @xmath100 mixing parameter @xmath101 only . in a recent phase shift analysis , in which the basel group has used their newly measured spin correlation parameter in a neutron - proton scattering , they have obtained the value of @xmath102 at 50 mev @xcite .",
    "the another analysis @xcite , which includes also the basel data , reports the value of @xmath103 for the same energy .",
    "our prediction is just below 2.6@xmath104 , which is consistent with both mentioned analyses .    to realize the quality of the present phase shifts description",
    ", it should be articulated that this should be compared rather to other existing ( semi)microscopic results than to the fully phenomenological fit as the bonn model is .",
    "thus , fujiwara and hecht , after their impressive development of the nonrelativistic resonating group method based model , have concluded that they have obtained the semiquantitative fit of the nn phase shifts @xcite .",
    "similar results as that ones have been obtained also in ref . @xcite .",
    "after a development described in refs .",
    "@xcite , a semiquantitative fit of the nn scattering data have been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , using but two different couplings for the isoscalar - scalar meson - nucleon vertex .",
    "now we compare the qcm coupling constant predictions with that ones obtained within the framework of a nonlinear chiral meson theory in which nucleons emerge as topological solitons ( chsm ) .",
    "notice that even though accentuating different aspects , both methods , qcm and chsm , have been deduced from qcd .",
    "the chsm coupling costants have been calculated in two model versions in ref .",
    "@xcite with inclusion of the @xmath105 , @xmath6 , and @xmath4 mesons as explicit degrees of freedom .",
    "the complete model accounts not only for the chiral anomaly of the underlying qcd through the wess - zumino term governing the @xmath4 meson coupling to the topological baryon current , as minimal model does , but has also that part of the wess - zimino action , which incorporates additional @xmath106 couplings .",
    "further , we compare theoretical predictions to the meson - nucleon coupling constants from other nn scattering studies .",
    "the qcm and both chsm predictions are together with empirical coupling constants that have been obtained by two leading groups in the low energy nn scattering phenomenology , namely the bonn and nijmegen groups , shown in table [ compar ] .",
    "the inspection in table [ compar ] reveals that all qcm coupling constants are lower than chsm predictions . as seen from the difference between the minimal and complete chsm models , the mentioned @xmath106 coupling term decrease the @xmath105nn coupling by 10 % , bringing it closer to our prediction . nevertheless , the complete model prediction is still 13 % higher .",
    "note that the much closer result ( 14.44 ) have been obtained by ho@xmath107gaasen and myhrer @xcite within but the cloudy bag model .",
    "a present warm discussion @xcite about the @xmath105nn coupling constant has appeared on account of the analysis of new @xmath105n scattering data by arndt and coworkers @xcite . in that work",
    "the vpi&su group has estimated the charged - pion coupling constant to be 13.31 @xmath1080.27 being thus in the middle between earlier results of the nijmegen group .",
    "the last group has found first @xmath109 = 13.11 @xmath1080.11 in @xcite and later @xmath109 = 13.55 @xmath1080.13 in @xcite .",
    "problems arise because these new values of the @xmath105nn coupling are much lower than the coupling constant value commonly used for more than a decade , namely 14.28 @xmath1080.18 , see , refs .",
    "the primary instruction coming from this development is that the stated errors , being statistical only on the level of 1% , seriously underestimate the real uncertainty @xcite . in the last reference",
    "it has been shown as well that the minimal value of the @xmath110 , which is necessary to describe the deuteron quadrupole moment is 13.65 for the bonn obep @xcite .",
    "the qcm predicts the @xmath105nn coupling constant , which is close to the last value and to the nijmegen value .",
    "the qcm prediction of the @xmath95 meson - nucleon coupling is near to the nijmegen coupling and between the bonn values .",
    "the nijmegen @xmath94nn coupling is close to our prediction too .      comparing the qcm predicted @xmath111nn coupling constant to phenomenological values obtained in the nn scattering fit",
    ", we find that our value is between the bonn@xmath112 model and the nijmegen model values .",
    "all together are but much higher than the bonn@xmath113 value .",
    "since we do not know other predictions of the @xmath114nn coupling constant we do not show this value in table [ compar ] .",
    "note , however , that a decrease of its coupling in comparison with the @xmath3nn coupling shows the mass dependence of the scalar - isoscalar meson - nucleon coupling .",
    "as we mentioned already , the intermediate range attractions have been obtained from the correlated two - pion exchange , which has been evaluated with the minimal model lagrangian of chsm in ref .",
    "@xcite . the resulting two - pion strength between solitons then authors have parameterized by exchange of one - scalar - isoscalar meson with the shown coupling constant .",
    "the range of uncertainty shown there originate in different ad hoc taken pion - loops renormalizing cutoffs .",
    "the authors claim , however , that taking into account the full lagrangian coupling should lead to a higher predicted @xmath3nn coupling and thus perhaps close to the qcm result .    within the obe models we use the effective scalar - isoscalar meson as the intermediate range attraction simulating field .",
    "consequently , the constraint on its coupling constant requires of it to has a reasonable value and to be in a strong correlation with the value of the short range repulsive strength , which is generated by the effective @xmath4 vector meson - nucleon coupling .",
    "thus , as we explain already , these effective fields simulate the more complex exchanges as well and therefore the values of their couplings can not be compared to the qcm nor chsm results .",
    "_ dirac coupling . _",
    "the accepted @xmath6nn vector couplings are about 0.43 @xmath1080.10 @xcite , 0.5 @xcite , which agree with the qcm prediction .",
    "these values are compatible with the minimal model prediction but the @xmath106 coupling term of the complete model increase it by additional 47 % .",
    "so , the chsm predictions are 1.36 and 2 times higher then our result .",
    "our value of the dirac @xmath6nn coupling is close to the bonn@xmath113 value , which is but about a factor of 2 lower than bonn@xmath112 one .",
    "note that the bonn@xmath113 obep is the same for both isospin channels , like the qrba9 one , and unlike the bonn@xmath112 set .",
    "the nijmegen obep @xmath6nn coupling is too far from accepted values also , but together with bonn@xmath112 value agree with the prediction of the complete chsm version .",
    "as qcm is constructed within the su(3 ) frame , the qcm ratio of the @xmath4 to @xmath6 vector meson couplings is also su(3 ) one , namely @xmath115 = 9 .",
    "thus the su(3 ) expected @xmath4nn vector coupling is about 4 .",
    "both chsm predictions dynamically violate this symmetry being 10.8 and 7.4 for the minimal and complete models , respectively",
    ". nevertheless , chsm predictions are 1.64 times higher of our value , which is just in the middle between rates we have found for the @xmath6nn couplings .",
    "_ pauli coupling .",
    "_ it is interesting to observe that the chsm pauli couplings of the vector mesons have been shifted more closely to the qcm predicted values when @xmath106 coupling term is included also .",
    "thus , the complete model pauli to dirac ratio predictions are much close to the empirical findings .",
    "the size of the pauli coupling constant , which is in common use in obe models have relied @xcite on the old analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite . in that paper the value of @xmath116",
    "= 6.1 @xmath1080.6 was obtained for a ratio of the pauli to dirac coupling constants .",
    "it is known but that the @xmath116 has to be consistent with the empirical value following from a vector meson dominance of a low momentum part of the nucleon electromagnetic form factor .",
    "the empirical value of @xmath116 = 3.7 @xcite is consistent with our qcm value @xmath116 = 3.66 and with the nijmegen model value @xmath116 = 4.221 .",
    "a recent study of the deutron properties by machleidt and sammarruca @xcite shown that to use @xmath116 = 3.7 in the bonn@xmath112 obep @xmath110 = 13.65 is needed .",
    "this finding is , however , close to the qcm predictions .",
    "expected form factor cutoff masses for different elementary meson - nucleon vertices would not be very different from the well known value of the electromagnetic cutoff mass . the last value is well described in qcm as in chsm @xcite as well as in lattice qcd calculations @xcite , and quark bag models @xcite .",
    "the only experimentally studied meson - nucleon vertex is the @xmath105nn one . for this vertex",
    ", model calculations as well as empirical analyses favour the @xmath117 value of about 0.9 gev . on the other hand , a more indirect process as the nn scattering is , require a much higher value .",
    "it thus appears that @xmath118 needed in the nn scattering is an effective quantity .    as we have mentioned in sect .",
    "1 , the expected medium vacuum fluctuations change meson and nucleon propagations @xcite and create a variety of different forms of correlations on both structure levels , the qcd as well as the qhd levels .",
    "second , as known , and as it has been recently calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite , the meson - nucleon interaction is density dependent . whether this density dependence of a bare meson - nucleon system is effective enough to modify",
    "the low energy nn scattering is a priori not known .",
    "further , it is known that the couplings depend also on a type of relativistic equation in use ( to observe this one can intercompare obep parameters shown in tables a.1 and a.2 of the ref .",
    "@xcite ) and on a chosen spectrum of exchanged particles ( compare , e.g. , different obe models of the ref .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore , in the present work we do not intend to solve this form factor problem , but we parameterize it , as all others do also .    within the present environment , composed of the blankenbecler - sugar - logunov - tavkheli - dze equation and the qrba9 obe model , most of used cutoffs are not very certainly determined .",
    "the cutoff masses of the @xmath95 , @xmath94 and @xmath111 mesons may be changed in a wide interval of values without a significant deterioration of the fit quality .",
    "the @xmath105nn and @xmath6nn vertex cutoffs are on the other hand determined strictly with their correlation measuring -97@xmath119 .",
    "although , we do not apply the qcm predicted cutoffs here , it is of specific interest to compare them with other findings , especially for the critical @xmath105nn and @xmath6nn vertices . the qcm predicts for the @xmath117 and @xmath120 , the values of 0.88 and 0.60 gev , respectively .",
    "these predictions may be compared to the results of a non - linear chiral meson theory of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the values obtained for @xmath117 and @xmath120 are 0.86 and 0.93 gev , respectively .",
    "although the absolute values of the qcm are very different from the qrba9 model values , table [ obep ] , we find that their ratio is 1.477 comparing to the qrba9 value of 1.494 .",
    "the mentioned density dependence of the form factor cutoffs , estimated in @xcite for @xmath117 and @xmath120 , represents approximately 20 and 10@xmath119 reduction at the nuclear density , respectively . on the other hand",
    ", a comparison of the qrba9 cutoffs with the qcm ones shows that the former values are changed by a factor higher than two .",
    "this indicate that the density dependence of the form factor cutoffs may be neglected here .",
    "the high @xmath118 value seems to be nevertheless understandable as an effect produced by vacuum fluctuations in meson exchange currents studied as a renormalization problem in meson theories @xcite . as recently has been suggested by ueda @xcite accounts for the role of the @xmath121 and @xmath122 loops",
    "explain satisfactorily a difference between the @xmath118 and @xmath123 values . here , the last @xmath123 cutoff , which has a value consistent with our @xmath117 value , is the pion - nucleon cutoff one needs to interpret a nuclear three - body problem .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the low energy part of the nn scattering relying on the empirical findings that the mesonic degrees of freedom represent a proper way to describe hadron scattering at this energy domain @xcite . in this , we have constructed the one boson exchange model using the meson - nucleon couplings predicted by qcm , a model deduced from the qcd .",
    "it is to be mentioned that it was not our intention to find a quantitatively competitive description of the nn scattering observables in the present work .",
    "rather , we intend to find a way to understood the nn scattering ( generally baryon - baryon scattering ) observables having a model parameterized on the quark level only , although it may not be achieved early , and a some guidance should be gathered step by step .    thus the present nn scattering description is composed of the blankenbecler - sugar - logunov - tavkhelidze quasipotential equation and the qrba9 obe model .",
    "constructing the qrba9 obep we take the meson - nucleon copuling constants as we obtain them as parameter - free predictions of the qcm . the intermediate range attraction and the repulsive short range components of the nn forces we describe as usual through the effective @xmath3 and @xmath4 exchanges .",
    "the cutoff masses we subjugate to fit the empirical phase shifts as common in all models constructed up to now . in result we find that our phase shifts well agree with the empirical data .",
    "the ratio of our @xmath5 which we obtain with the qrba9 model to the @xmath5 we calculate for the bonn model @xcite is 1.23 , what is the unexpectedly good result .",
    "the @xmath118 and @xmath124 cutoffs we obtain here are compatible with common obep values , however , they are much higher than that ones predicted by the qcm . this observation indicate that the present @xmath105 and @xmath6 meson exchanges effectively simulate some other processes too .",
    "ueda s explanation of this problem with using vacuum fluctuations in the @xmath105 exchange channel suggests that the same mechanism may be capable to account for cutoff mass differences in @xmath6 meson exchange channel too .",
