    "optomechanical resonators couple optical cavities and mechanical resonators mutually through optomechanical interactions mediated by the radiation - pressure forces . with the exceptional capability of probing and controlling mesoscopic mechanical motion down to single quantum level",
    ", micro / nano - optomechanical resonators have been intensively investigated in recent years , showing great promise for broad applications in sensing , information processing , time / frequency metrology , and quantum physics @xcite . to date , diverse optomechanical structures @xcite have been developed on a variety of material platforms including silica @xcite , silicon nitride @xcite , silicon @xcite , gallium arsenide @xcite , aluminium nitride @xcite , diamond @xcite , phospho - silicate glass @xcite , and gallium phosphide @xcite . in general ,",
    "cavity optomechanics relies critically on the underlying device material , requiring not only high optical transparency and large refractive index to support the high - quality and strong - confined optical modes , but also large acoustic velocity and low material damping to support the high - frequency and high - quality mechanical resonances .",
    "silicon carbide ( sic ) is well known for its outstanding thermal , optical , mechanical and chemical properties @xcite , with broad applications in high - power electronics , micromechanical sensors , biomedical devices , and astronomical telescopes @xcite . in the past few years",
    ", significant efforts have been devoted to develop sic - based micro / nanophotonic devices @xcite , greatly attracted by its nonlinear optical properties @xcite and defect characteristics @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "recent theoretical studies @xcite show that sic exhibits intrinsic mechanical quality significantly superior than other materials , with a theoretical frequency - quality ( @xmath2 ) product @xmath3 at room temperature , due to its exceptionally low phonon - phonon scattering that dominates the intrinsic mechanical loss in the microwave frequency regime .",
    "the high intrinsic mechanical quality , together with the outstanding optical properties , makes sic an excellent material platform for optomechanical applications .",
    "unfortunately , the superior mechanical rigidity and chemical inertness of sic impose significant challenge on fabricating micro-/nano - photonic devices with high optical and mechanical qualities , which seriously hinders the realization of optomechanical functionalities on the sic platform .    in this letter",
    ", we demonstrate the first sic optomechanical microresonators that exhibit significant optomechanical coupling with a coefficient up to @xmath4 , which enables us to efficiently actuate and characterize the mesoscopic mechanical motions by optical means . by optimizing the device structure and the fabrication process",
    ", we are able to achieve high optical quality , large mechanical frequency , and high mechanical quality simultaneously in a single device .",
    "the whispering - gallery modes exhibit high optical qualities around @xmath5 .",
    "the radial - breathing mechanical modes show frequencies up to 1.69  ghz and mechanical qualities around 5500 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath2 product is @xmath6 , which is the highest value for the fundamental bulk acoustic mode in sic demonstrated to date @xcite , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "the high performance of the demonstrated optomechanical microresonators shows that sic devices are now ready for broad optomechanical applications . with the superior thermal and chemical properties of sic material@xcite , sic optomechanical devices are particularly attractive for optomechanical sensing , such as displacement , force , mass , and inertial sensing , especially in harsh environments that are challenging for other device platforms .",
    "on the other hand , the sic optomechanical microresonators , in combination with sic s significant optical nonlinearities @xcite and unique defect characteristics @xcite , are of great promise for realizing hybrid micro / nanophotonic circuits for nano - optomechanics , integrated nonlinear photonics , and quantum photonics .",
    "the devices we employed are cubic - type ( 3c ) silicon carbide ( sic ) microresonators sitting on silicon pedestals . the device fabrication process is described in _",
    "methods_. figure [ sem](a ) shows the fabricated devices of different radii with smooth sidewalls and fine - controlled undercuts .",
    "the fabrication process is optimized to produce smooth sidewalls , which are critical for minimizing the scattering loss of the optical modes .",
    "the device undercuts are optimized to reduce the clamping loss , which improves the mechanical qualities of the radial - breathing modes .",
    "the microresonator exhibits whispering - gallery optical modes ( fig .",
    "[ sem]b ) that produce radiation pressure along the radial direction to actuate the fundamental radial - breathing mechanical modes ( fig .",
    "[ sem]c ) , which in turn changes the cavity length and thus shifts the optical resonance frequency .",
    "the resulting dynamic backaction between the optical field and mechanical motion can be used to excite and probe the coherent mechanical motion , with efficiency dependent on the optomechanical coupling strength . for a microdisk optomechanical resonator with a radius of @xmath7 ,",
    "the optomechanical coupling coefficient scales as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 represents the optical resonance frequency .",
    "the detailed simulations by the finite - element method ( fem ) show that a sic microdisk with a radius of 2  @xmath10 and a thickness of 700  nm exhibits optomechanical coupling coefficients of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , for the fundamental and second - order transverse - electric - like ( te - like ) modes , which correspond to a strong radiation pressure force of @xmath13 and 48  fn produced by each photon , respectively .",
    "the fem simulation indicates that the fundamental radial - breathing mechanical mode of the device exhibits an effective motional mass of @xmath14  picograms . as a result",
    ", the vacuum optomechanical coupling rate , @xmath15 , is as large as @xmath16 for the fundamental te - like modes in the device .",
    "the optical properties of devices are tested by a fiber - device coupling setup shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "a tunable laser is launched into the devices by evanescent coupling through a tapered optical fiber .",
    "the cavity transmission is coupled out by the same tapered fiber and then recorded by fast detectors .",
    "the laser wavelength is calibrated by a mach - zehnder interferometer .",

    "[ transmission](a ) with multiple high - q optical modes .",
    "three optical modes from different mode families all show optical qualities around @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "[ transmission](b ) ) .",
    "the coupling conditions of these modes can be easily tuned from under coupled , critical coupled to over coupled by tuning the fiber - device distance .",
    "for example , the cavity modes located around 1528  nm and 1553  nm are nearly critically coupled in this case .",
    "the high optical quality of the whispering gallery modes , combined with the strong optomechanical coupling , enables efficient excitation and probing of the mechanical motion . to do so",
    ", we launch an optical wave ( the pump wave ) into a cavity resonance , with power sinusoidally modulated at a frequency around the mechanical resonance frequency . the operation principle is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ setup](b ) .",
    "a sinusoidal modulation of the optical power leads to a sinusoidally time varying radiation pressure that actuates the radial - breathing mechanical motion coherently via the strong optomechanical coupling . to probe such optomechanical excitation",
    ", we launch a weak continuous - wave optical wave ( the probe wave ) at a different cavity resonance .",
    "the coherent optomechanical excitation modulates the probe field inside the cavity via the optomechanical coupling , which is in turn transduced to the cavity output .",
    "figure [ setup](a ) shows schematically the experiment testing setup , with more detailed information given in the _ methods_.",
    "the devices are tested at room temperature in the atmospheric environment .",
    "a detailed analysis of the optomechanical dynamics shows that the modulated probe power , @xmath18 , at the modulation frequency @xmath19 , detected at the cavity transmission is given by @xmath20 \\delta u_p ( \\omega ) h_s(\\delta_s ) } , \\label{eq_probe1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 represents the modulated intra - cavity pump energy .",
    "@xmath22 is the cavity transduction function of the probe mode .",
    "the detailed expressions of @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be found in ref .",
    "( [ eq_probe1 ] ) includes both optomechanical effect and optical kerr effect .",
    "the first term describes the optomechanical response , with @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the frequency and damping rate of the mechanical mode , respectively .",

    "@xmath30 is the resonance frequency of the probe mode and @xmath31 represents the effective volume of the optical mode .",
    "our devices fall into the sideband unresolved regime , where the mechanical frequency is much smaller than the optical linewidth @xcite . in this regime , eq .  ( [ eq_probe1 ] ) can be simplified to @xmath32 \\frac{\\delta p_d ( \\omega)}{\\gamma_{\\rm 0p } } \\frac{2 \\gamma_{\\rm es } \\gamma_{\\rm 0s } \\delta_s}{\\left [ \\delta_s^2+(\\gamma_{\\rm ts}/2)^2 \\right]^2 } } ,    \\label{eq_probe2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 stands for the modulated pump power dropped inside the cavity .",
    "@xmath34 is the intrinsic photon decay rate of the pump mode . @xmath35 and @xmath36 represent intrinsic and total photon decay rate of the probe mode , respectively .",
    "@xmath37 represents its external coupling rate .",
    "@xmath38 is the laser - cavity detuning of the probe wave .    in the experiments , the optical mode is typically near critical - coupling conditions , @xmath39 , and the laser detuning for the probe mode is set around the half of total cavity linewidth @xmath40 . as a result , eq .  [ eq_probe2 ] reduces considerably to @xmath41 \\frac{\\delta p_d ( \\omega)}{2 \\gamma_{\\rm 0p } \\gamma_{\\rm 0s}}}.    \\label{eq_probe3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "equation ( [ eq_probe3 ] ) clearly shows the linear dependence of the transduced probe signal on the optical qualities of the pump and probe modes .",
    "moveover , it depends quadratically on the optomechanical coupling coefficient @xmath42 since the optomechanical effect not only drives the mechanical mode by the modulated pump beam , but also transduces the mechanical motion to the probe beam . consequently , significant optomechanical coupling and high optical quality in the devices would lead to efficient optomechanical excitation and transduction by the pump and probe waves .",
    "equations ( [ eq_probe1])-([eq_probe3 ] ) show that , by scanning the modulation frequency , we can obtain the mechanical response of the radial - breathing mode .",
    "figure [ mech](b ) shows three examples of devices with different radii of 2 , 4.25 , and 6 @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the radial - breathing mechanical modes exhibit distinctive mechanical frequencies in these devices but all with a mechanical q above 5000 .",
    "the slight spectral asymmetry on the mechanical spectra is primarily due to the fano - type interference between the narrow - band mechanical response and the broadband background of optical kerr nonlinear response ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq_probe2 ] ) ) .",
    "a comparison of the recorded optomechanical spectra with the theory infers an optomechanical coupling coefficient of @xmath43 for the 2 @xmath10 device .",
    "this value agrees closely with the theoretical expectation obtained from the fem simulations .",
    "moreover , we characterize the devices with different radii to map out the dependence of mechanical frequency . as shown in fig .",
    "[ mech](a ) , the mechanical frequency of the radial - breathing mode scales inversely with the device radius . comparing the experimental data ( blue dots ) with the theoretical prediction ( red curve )",
    ", we infer the young s modulus to be 390  gpa , which is consistent with previous measurements of 3c - sic epitaxial films on silicon substrates @xcite",
    ".    one critical figure of merit for mechanical resonators is the @xmath2 product , which quantifies the degree of decoupling of mechanical motion from the environmental thermal reservoir @xcite .",
    "figure [ fq ] summarizes the @xmath2 product reported to date for sic micro / nanomechanical resonators @xcite .",
    "in general , bridge- and cantilever - type sic micro / nanomechanical resonators exhibit low @xmath2 products , with a mechanical damping dominated by the mechanical clamping loss . to mitigate the clamping loss , high - order overtone - bulk - acoustic - resonator ( obar ) modes",
    "are employed to store mechanical energy over many mechanical wavelengths @xcite , which , however , requires a large device size significantly greater than the mechanical wavelength that seriously limits the device miniaturization and integration .",
    "in contrast , our optomechanical resonators operate in the fundamental radial - breathing acoustic mode , with a small device size comparable to the mechanical wavelength . for example , the device with a radius of 2 @xmath10 exhibits a frequency of 1.69 ghz and a mechanical q of 5589 ( fig .",
    "[ mech](b ) ) , which corresponds to a @xmath0 product of @xmath44 hz .",
    "this product is among the largest values reported up to date of sic devices @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "in fact , our device has the largest @xmath0 product among whispering - gallery - type optomechanical microresonators made from various materials @xcite .",
    "this value is still about an order of magnitude lower than the theoretical @xmath0 product @xcite , implying that the current limitation is not on intrinsic mechanical loss of sic material , but on practical factors such as device etching , pillar clamping , and air damping .",
    "we thus expect improvement of the @xmath0 product in the future after further optimization of the device structure and fabrication process .",
    "we have demonstrated the first sic optomechanical resonators in 3c - sic microdisks that exhibit strong optomechanical coupling and excellent mechanical qualities , with a @xmath2 product as high as @xmath45 . the high performance of the demonstrated devices infers that the sic optomechanical devices are of great potential for metrology and sensing applications , particularly in detecting displacement , force , mass , and acceleration / rotation with high sensitivity . in combination with sic s superior thermal property , chemical inertness , hand high breakdown voltage ,",
    "sic optomechanical devices are of great promise for applications in various harsh environments , such as those with high temperature , reactive chemicals , biological fluid , or high electric field @xcite , that are challenging for other device platforms .",
    "on the other hand , the sic optomechanical microresonators exhibit a mechanical frequency scalable by the device radius .",
    "in particular , the sic microdisk with a radius of 2.5  @xmath10 exhibits a mechanical frequency of 1.33  ghz ( see fig .  [ mech ] ) , which matches the zero - field splitting of spin ground states of the point defects in 3c - sic @xcite",
    ". therefore , the high - q collective mechanical mode is potentially able to coherently interact with the ground states of the defect spin via stress - induced coupling .",
    "this mechanism , in combination with the photon - spin coupling in sic @xcite and photon - photon interaction via sic s significant @xmath46 and @xmath47 nonlinearities @xcite , is of great potential to form a hybrid micro-/nano - photonic circuit that mutually couples photon , defect spin , and acoustic phonon for nonlinear optical , quantum optical , and optomechanical functionalities .",
    "the device structure we employed is cubic - polytype silicon carbide ( 3c - sic ) microdisks sitting on silicon pedestals . a high - definition electron - beam resist ( zep520a )",
    "is used to pattern chromium ( cr ) mask with chlorine - based plasma by reactive - ion etching ( rie ) .",
    "the cr mask is later used as a hard mask to etch sic with fluorine - based plasma by inductively coupled - plasma rie .",
    "the residue of cr is then released by cr-14 , a cr etchant , and the silicon substrate is undercut by potassium hydroxide .",
    "the device is annealed afterwards at @xmath48 for 2 hours .",
