    "x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) is a widely - used technique for investigating the electronic structure of solids .",
    "nevertheless , the relatively high surface sensitivity of conventional laboratory - based xps constitutes an essential disadvantage for this technique .",
    "high surface sensitivity sometimes makes information on the bulk electronic states difficult to obtain , because the results are influenced by large surface contributions such as inherent modifications of the near surface regions and/or surface contaminations .",
    "hard x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( hx - pes ) which makes use of monochromatized undulator hard x - rays , was first reported in 2003 .",
    "it has allowed us to overcome this limitation.@xcite this method uses photoelectrons with large kinetic energy , thereby considerably increasing the probin depth , which minimizes or even eliminates the surface contributions in many cases .",
    "this technique greatly expands the range of applications of photoelectron spectroscopy and offers unique opportunities for investigating advanced functional materials such as nano - scale multilayers and nano clusters . for general users , however ,",
    "hx - pes based on synchrotron radiation is often inconvenient , especially for researchers who conduct most of their research at their own laboratories .",
    "in addition , competition is so high for synchrotron beamtime that not enough proposals are accepted .",
    "this situation can be a serious barrier preventing prompt analysis of exotic , newly synthesized materials .",
    "many of these problems are resolved by laboratory hard x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( hxps ) by using `` the high - energy angle - resolved photoelectron spectrometer for laboratory use ( hearp lab . ) '' developed recently by kobata et al . , which employs monochromatic cr k@xmath0 x - rays ( @xmath1 ev ) .",
    "they demonstrated that the system provides practical throughput and energy resolution and applied it to various materials to exhibit its versatility as a bulk - sensitive probe of the electronic and chemical states of materials.@xcite    we used hxps to investigate the electronic structure of a perovskite - type manganese oxide la@xmath10sr@xmath3mno@xmath4 ( lsmo ) . in spite of a long history since",
    "its first report,@xcite lsmo is still a well - known modern compound because of colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr).@xcite this remarkable phenomenon is based on the unique electronic structure of a mn@xmath11mn@xmath12 mixed - valence system with @xmath13 symmetry , which leads to the double - exchange ( de ) mechanism.@xcite however , de alone can not explain the _ colossal _",
    "mr effects,@xcite so further study of the electronic - structure of these materials is still required . in this paper , we report a comprehensive comparative study of the cmr manganite ( lsmo ) based on the conventional xps ( al k@xmath0 , @xmath8 ev ) , hxps ( cr k@xmath0 , @xmath1 ev ) , and hx - pes ( @xmath9 ev ) .",
    "polycrystalline samples of la@xmath10sr@xmath3mno@xmath4 ( @xmath7 = 0.0 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.33 , 0.4 , 0.5 , 0.55 , 0.67 , 0.8 , 0.9 , 1.0 ) were prepared by solid - state reaction . starting powders of la(oh)@xmath4 ( 99.9% , shin - etsu chemical ) , srco@xmath4 ( 99.8% , sakai chemical industry ) , and mn@xmath14o@xmath4 ( 99.9% , kojundo chemcal laboratory ) were weighed in specific proportions and then mixed by ball milling in ethanol for 15 h with zirconia balls .",
    "the mixtures were dried and heated at @xmath15c for 2 h in air . after cooling ,",
    "the powders were crushed by the ball milling again for 15 h. the powders were again dried , and then pressed into pellet form by applying an isostatic pressure of 0.8 ton/@xmath16 .",
    "finally , they were sintered at @xmath17c for 1 h in air .",
    "hxps spectra were acquired by using `` hearp lab . ''",
    "system consisting of a vg - scienta r4000 electron analyzer and a monochromatic cr k@xmath0 x - ray source ( @xmath1 ev ) .",
    "the energy resolution was about 0.55 ev . for all measurements , the x - ray beam was focused onto the sample at a 100 @xmath18 m @xmath19 spot .",
    "the binding energy was calibrated based on the position of the au @xmath20 peak ( 84.0 ev ) and the fermi level ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "for the measurements , the samples were kept in ultrahigh vacuum below @xmath22 torr .",
    "xps measurements were made with a phi quantera sxm instrument ( base pressure @xmath23 torr ) , which uses a monochromatic al k@xmath0 x - ray source ( @xmath8 ev ) with an energy resolution of about 0.64 ev full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "the analyzer pass energy was set to 55 ev for narrow scans .",
    "the binding energy was corrected by using the value of 84.0 ev from the au @xmath20 core - level spectrum .",
    "the measurement vacuum was better than @xmath24 torr .",

    "this shift is attributed to the recoil effect of oxygen atom in the photoemission process .",

    ", we fit the corelevel spectra with multiple voigt functions .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows that the behavior of @xmath41 for the la @xmath34 , sr @xmath34 , and o @xmath5 core levels are basically identical for @xmath42 regardless of whether the spectra were acquired by xps or by hxps .",
    "this behavior is also in good agreement with that reported for @xmath43.@xcite figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig3 ] show that the increase in @xmath41 with @xmath7 continues up to @xmath27 .",
    "in contrast , an obvious discontinuity in @xmath41 is apparent from the spectra above @xmath27 , where @xmath41 decreases rapidly .",
    "@xmath41 can theoretically be described as @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the chemical - potential shift as a function of @xmath7 , @xmath46 is the change in the number of valence electrons of the relevant ion , @xmath47 is an empirical constant , @xmath48 is the change in the madelung potential at the relevant ion , and @xmath28 is the change in the inter - atomic relaxation energy of the core hole due to screening by metallic conduction electrons .",
    "the @xmath49 term is zero for these three core levels .",
    "no obvious discontinuity occurs across the metal ",
    "insulator transition between @xmath50 and 0.2 , which implies that @xmath28 is negligible .",
    "therefore , we expect @xmath51 theoretical and experimental studies of @xmath41 established that @xmath48 is negligible for typical carrier - doped systems such as la@xmath2sr@xmath3mno@xmath4 or la@xmath52sr@xmath3cuo@xmath53 _ within the same crystal structure_. thus , we conclude that @xmath54 for @xmath55 .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the chemical potential of these hole - doped systems should decrease continuously with @xmath7 ( namely , @xmath45 decreases with @xmath7 ) unless a large gap suddenly opens .",
    "therefore , the observed rapid turn or discontinuity of @xmath41 at @xmath27 is most likely due to a change in @xmath48 caused by a structural phase transition from a ( pseudo ) cubic phase ( @xmath55 ) to a hexagonal phase ( @xmath56).@xcite    noted that @xmath41 for the feature s in the mn @xmath6 peak shows exactly the same behavior as @xmath41 for the other three core levels , particularly the o @xmath5 hxps core level whereas the other components p@xmath35 , p@xmath14 , and p@xmath36 have characteristics different from those of s ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "so far it has been reported that @xmath41 for mn @xmath6 is distinctly different from @xmath41 for the above three core levels.@xcite the result of these reports is attributed to their analysis that did not ( actually could not ) decompose the mn @xmath6 peak into multiple components although the average valence is changing from @xmath57 to @xmath58 ( i.e. , @xmath59 ) . in the present analysis , the high bulk sensitivity and large practical throughput of hxps enables us to extract for the first time a component of @xmath41 proportional to @xmath45 from the mn @xmath6 peak .",
    "the behavior of feature s may be explained rather simply : s is the well - screened mn @xmath6 final state at the mn@xmath11 site and the chemical potential @xmath21 is in the @xmath60 band ( except for @xmath61 ) , which means that @xmath21 is `` located at the mn@xmath11 '' that have @xmath60 electrons .",
    "by using xps , hxps , and hx - pes , we have performed a comparative study of the electronic structure of the cmr manganite la@xmath10sr@xmath3mno@xmath4 for the whole range of @xmath7 .",
    "we observed the recoil effect in the o @xmath5 hxps spectra , which confirms theoretical predictions .",
    "no appreciable surface contribution appears in the o @xmath5 hxps spectra , and an enhanced low - energy shoulder structure appears in the mn @xmath6 hxps spectra . by combining high bulk sensitivity and large practical throughput ,",
    "hxps enables us to track the lowenergy shoulder structure in the mn @xmath6 spectra over a wide range of @xmath7 , which gives new insight into the binding - energy shift of the mn @xmath6 core level .",
    "the throughput and the energy resolution of hxps is thus as good as that of xps , and the bulk sensitivity of hxps is as good as that of hxpes .",
    "together , the results demonstrate that laboratory - based hxps has significant potential for general or systematic analysis of bulk electronic structure .",
