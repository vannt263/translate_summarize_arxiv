    "astrophysical models can explain the origin of most nuclei beyond the iron group in a combination of processes involving neutron captures on long ( _ s _ process ) or short ( _ r _ process ) time scales @xcite .",

    "pre - existing seed nuclei from the _ s _ and _ r _ processes are destroyed by photodisintegration in a high - temperature environment , and proton - rich isotopes are produced by ( @xmath0__,n _ _ ) reactions .",
    "when ( @xmath0__,p _ _ ) and ( @xmath12 ) reactions become comparable or faster than neutron emission within an isotopic chain , the reaction path branches out and feeds nuclei with lower charge number _",
    "z_. the decrease in temperature at later stages of the _ p _ process leads to a freeze - out via neutron captures and mainly @xmath11 decays , resulting in the typical _",
    "p_-process abundance pattern with maxima at @xmath13mo ( _ _ n__=50 ) and @xmath14sm ( _ _ n__=82 ) .",
    "the currently most favored astrophysical site for the _ p _ process is explosive burning in type ii supernovae .",
    "the explosive shock front heats the outer o / ne shell of the progenitor star to temperatures of 2 - 3 gk , sufficient for providing the required photodisintegrations . following the nucleosynthesis in such astrophysical models , good agreement with the required _",
    "production is found , with exception of the low ( _ _ a__@xmath4100 ) and intermediate ( 150@xmath15__a__@xmath15 165 ) mass range , which are underproduced by factors of 3 - 4 @xcite .",
    "because of these persisting problems , alternative scenarios ( such as type ia supernovae and x - ray bursters ) have been suggested , each with their own , inherent difficulties @xcite . currently , however , it is not yet clear whether the observed underproductions are due to a problem with astrophysical models or with the nuclear physics input , i.e. reaction rates .",
    "thus , a necessary requirement towards a consistent understanding of the _ p _ process is the reduction of uncertainties in nuclear data . by far most of the several hundreds of required photodisintegration rates and their inverses",
    "need to be inferred from hauser - feshbach statistical model calculations @xcite , e.g. the codes non - smoker @xcite and most @xcite .",
    "experimental data can improve the situation in two ways , either by directly replacing predictions with measured cross sections in the relevant energy range , or by testing the reliability of predictions at other energies when the relevant energy range is not experimentally accessible .    the role of ( _ n_,@xmath0 ) reactions in the _ p _ process was underestimated for a long time , although it is obvious that they have an influence on the final _ p_-process abundances .",
    "neutron captures compete with ( @xmath0,_n _ ) reactions and thus hinder the photodisintegration flux towards light nuclei , especially at lower-_z _ isotopes and even - even isotopes in the vicinity of branching - points .",
    "the influence of a variation of reaction rates on the final _ p _ abundances has been studied previously @xcite .",
    "it turned out that the _ p _ abundances are very sensitive to changes of the neutron - induced rates in the entire mass range , whereas the proton - induced and @xmath16-induced reaction rates are important at low and high mass numbers , respectively .",

    "their nuclear flow schemes show that branching points occur even at light _",
    "nuclei , and are shifted deeper into the proton - rich unstable region with increasing mass and temperature . in contradiction to woosley and howard @xcite , who claimed for their network calculations that ( _ n_,@xmath0 ) can be neglected except for the lightest nuclei ( _ _ a__@xmath1590 ) , rayet et al . also examined the influence of neutron reactions for temperatures between _ _",

    "this rather high sensitivity indicates the need for reliable ( _ n_,@xmath0 ) rates to be used in _",
    "p_-process networks .",
    "although recent efforts are directed to calculation or measurement of photodisintegration cross sections and rates @xcite , astrophysical photodisintegration rates can easily be inferred from capture rates by detailed balance , even in theoretical work @xcite .",
    "the stellar reaction rate n@xmath18@xmath4@xmath19@xmath6@xmath20@xmath21 for the reaction is related to its inverse rate by @xmath22 with the avogadro number _ n@xmath18 _ , the nuclear spins _",

    "g(t ) _ and the reaction _ q _ value in the exponent .",
    "measuring or calculating a rate in the direction of positive _ q _ value ensures best numerical accuracy and consistency between forward and backward reaction .",
    "this is important when implementing those rates in reaction networks for nucleosynthesis models .    moreover , stellar cross sections and rates have to be employed for the computation of reverse rates . in a stellar environment",
    ", nuclei are fully thermalized with the environment , resulting in a thermal excitation of both the target and the final nucleus .",
