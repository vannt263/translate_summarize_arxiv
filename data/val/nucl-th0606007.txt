    "the above expectations motivated the project of the new accelerator facility fair at gsi @xcite , the heavy - ion program of which is precisely dedicated to studying dense baryonic matter with the emphasis on the onset of deconfinement and the critical end point .",
    "the future sps @xcite and rhic @xcite programs are also devoted to the same problems .    in refs .",
    "@xcite we have introduced 3-fluid dynamical ( 3fd ) model which is suitable for simulating heavy - ion collisions in the range from ags to sps energies , which overlaps the energy range of the future fair .",
    "we have started simulations @xcite with the purely hadronic equation of state ( eos ) @xcite in order to see how good the available data from ags and sps can be understood without involving the concept of deconfinement .",
    "this eos should serve as a reference point for simulations involving more sophisticated eos s including the phase transition .    with this simple hadronic eos we succeeded to reasonably reproduce a great body of experimental data in the incident energy range @xmath0 ( 1160)@xmath1 gev .",
    "the list includes rapidity distributions , transverse - mass spectra , and multiplicities of various hadrons .",
    "however , we also found out certain problems .",
    "in particular , we failed to describe the transverse flow at @xmath2 gev .",
    "one of the main conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite is that in order to conclude on the relevance of a particular eos the whole available set of data should be analyzed in a wide incident energy range with the same fixed parameters of the model .",
    "indeed almost for any particular piece of data the parameters of the model can be tuned in such a way that the model reasonably reproduces the data . at the same time",
    "the reproduction of the whole set of available data _ with the same model parameters _ is far from being always possible . in ref .",
    "@xcite we performed still fragmentary analysis of data due to constraints to frames of a single paper .",
    "therefore , in the present paper we would like to continue our analysis of a particular subset of the data concerning collective flow in nuclear collisions , based on the set of model parameters fixed in @xcite . accordingly",
    "to our preliminary results @xcite , this subset is the most problematic for the purely hadronic eos we use .",
    "the collective transverse flow is formed at the early ( compression ) stage of the collisions and hence reveals the early pressure gradients in the evolving nuclear matter .",
    "the harder eos is , the stronger pressure is developed .",
    "thus , the flow reflects stiffness of the nuclear eos . the collective flow observable",
    "has been extensively exploited to obtain information on the eos . in particular , it was expected that the transition to the quark - gluon phase results in significant reduction of the directed flow @xcite ( so called `` softest point '' effect ) , since the pressure in the quark - gluon phase is lower than that in the hadronic phase .",
    "calculations within conventional ( 1-fluid ) hydrodynamics @xcite indicated almost disappearance of the flow at the onset of the first - order phase transition",
    ". however , the nuclear finite stopping power essentially weakens this effect @xcite . in the present paper we are going to discuss the transverse flow in terms of stiffness of the nuclear eos and the stopping power achieved in the collision .    at present",
    "there are quite systematic collective - flow data , both on directed and elliptic transverse flows , at ags @xcite and sps @xcite energies .",
    "we confine our present discussion to the flow of non - strange probes , i.e. nucleons and pions .",
    "recent analysis of this set of data was done in ref .",
    "@xcite with emphasis on momentum dependence of nuclear forces .",
    "this was done within the jam model @xcite combined with a covariant prescription of mean fields ( rqmd / s ) @xcite with the emphasis on the momentum dependence of nuclear forces .",
    "we would like to analyze the same data but within the hydrodynamic approach .",
    "a direct way to address thermodynamic properties of the matter produced in these reactions consists in application of hydrodynamic simulations to nuclear collisions .",
    "however , finite nuclear stopping power , revealing itself at high incident energies , makes the collision dynamics non - equilibrium and prevents us from application of conventional hydrodynamics especially at the initial stage of the reaction .",
    "since the resulting non - equilibrium is quite strong , introduction of viscosity and thermal conductivity does not help to overcome this difficulty , because by definition they are suitable for weak non - equilibrium .",
    "a possible way out is taking advantage of a multi - fluid approximation to heavy - ion collisions .",
    "unlike the conventional hydrodynamics , where local instantaneous stopping of projectile and target matter is assumed , a specific feature of the dynamic 3-fluid description is a finite stopping power resulting in a counter - streaming regime of leading baryon - rich matter .",
    "experimental rapidity distributions in nucleus  nucleus collisions support this counter - streaming behavior , which can be observed for incident energies between few and 200@xmath1 gev .",
    "the basic idea of a 3-fluid approximation to heavy - ion collisions @xcite is that at each space - time point @xmath3 the generally nonequilibrium distribution function of baryon - rich matter , can be represented as a sum of two distinct contributions , @xmath4 , initially associated with constituent nucleons of the projectile ( p ) and target ( t ) nuclei .",
    "in addition , newly produced particles , populating the mid - rapidity region , are associated with a fireball ( f ) fluid described by the distribution function @xmath5 .",
    "it is assumed that constituents within each distribution are locally equilibrated , both thermodynamically and chemically .",
    "this assumption , justifying the term `` fluids '' , relies on the fact that intra - fluid collisions are much more efficient in driving a system to equilibrium than inter - fluid interactions .",
    "therefore , the 3-fluid approximation is a minimal way to simulate the finite stopping power at high incident energies .",
    "note that both the baryon - rich and fireball fluids may consist of any type of hadrons and/or partons ( quarks and gluons ) , rather than only nucleons and pions .",
    "our 3fd model @xcite is a straightforward extension of the 2-fluid model with radiation of direct pions @xcite and ( 2 + 1)-fluid model @xcite .",
    "we extend the above models in such a way that the created baryon - free fluid ( which we call a `` fireball '' fluid , following the frankfurt group ) is treated on equal footing with the baryon - rich ones .",
    "we allow a certain formation time for the fireball fluid , during which the matter of the fluid propagates without interactions .",
    "we assume that the fireball matter gets quickly thermalized after its formation .",
    "the latter approximation is an enforced one , since we deal with the hydrodynamics rather than with kinetics",

    "in fact , our pion directed flow correlates with proton one even at lower , ags energies , instead of anticorrelating . a probable reason for this poor reproduction of pion @xmath36",
    "consists in disregarding the fact that a part of frozen - out particles is `` shadowed '' by still hydrodynamically evolving matter .",
    "this mechanism of proton - pion anticorrelation was discussed in refs .",

    "apparently , the baryon directed flow is less affected by this shadowing .",

    "@xcite , the `` transition from hadronic to string matter '' practically saturates at the top ags energy .",
    "this also is in agreement with our observation that no extra softening of the eos in required at sps energies , as compared with the top ags energy .",
    "we have also found that it is impossible to simultaneously reproduce the directed and elliptic flow with the same eos .",
    "the directed flow requires a softer eos , while the elliptic flow demands for a harder eos .",
    "this observation is similar to that done in refs .",
    "@xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite it was found that a proper momentum dependence in the nuclear mean field is of prime importance for the simultaneous reproduction of the directed and elliptic flows .",
    "the fact that this momentum dependence is vitally important apparently suggests that the initial stage of nuclear collision ( i.e. the formation of so - called `` initial fireball '' ) is essentially nonequilibrium and that the flow is sensitive to this early nonequilibrium in transverse - momentum distribution .    at sps energies the directed - flow data favor the same extrasoft eos which was the best beginning from the incident energy of 8@xmath1 gev",
    "this eos softening can be associated with either the `` transition from hadronic to string matter '' @xcite , which has been mentioned already , or could be a signal of deconfinement transition . within the 3fd simulations the elliptic flow becomes low sensitive to the stiffness of the eos and even to the stopping power at these energies .",
    "lack of the proper description of the _ nonequilibrium _ transverse - momentum anisotropy at the initial stage of nuclear collision prevents the 3fd from good reproduction of the proton elliptic flow at sps energies .",
    "disagreement of the 3fd with the data is largest at 40@xmath1 gev incident energy , which may indicate that something special happens in the system at this energy .",
    "the above discussion suggests that the flow is an `` early - stage '' observable , i.e. that determined by early - stage evolution of the collision .",
    "our calculations with different freeze - out criteria ( different freeze - out energy densities @xmath45 ) , displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] , confirm this conjecture .",
    "from the point of view of freeze - out , the difference between @xmath46 0.2 and 0.6 gev/@xmath47 is huge  they correspond to completely different patterns of the freeze - out .",
    "nevertheless , the directed flow turns out to be fairly insensitive to this difference .",
    "slight sensitivity is observed only in spectator regions .",
    "the elliptic flow is a more subtle quantity .",
    "it is a measure of difference of the in - plane and out - of - plane flow .",
    "taking into account that our calculated @xmath38 are of the order of 5% and that sensitivity of @xmath36 with respect to above @xmath45 variations is @xmath48 1% , the value of 20% for the variation of @xmath38 under above change of @xmath45 looks quite natural . in fact , this low sensitivity of the flow to the freeze - out stage is not surprising .",
    "the @xmath36 flow is a measure of _ collective momentum _",
    "accumulated by matter during the expansion stage .",
    "the driving force of this collective momentum is the pressure gradient created at the early compression stage of the collision . if the freeze - out occurs not too early ( e.g. , not right after the compression stage ) , this pressure gradient has enough time to accelerate the matter , and hence late - stage evolution does not noticeably change the earlier - accumulated collective momentum .",
    "thus , problems in reproduction of flow data apparently result from not quite accurate description of early - stage transverse - momentum nonequilibrium within the 3fd rather than are caused by our intermediate hadronic eos .",
    "therefore , keeping in mind that with our intermediate hadronic eos we have succeeded to reasonably reproduce a large body of experimental data in the incident energy range @xmath0 ( 1160)@xmath1 gev @xcite , we can still conclude that this eos is certainly good ( however , not perfect ) in this energy range .",
    "however , since the required eos softening can be still associated with a deconfinement transition , other , more sophisticated eos s , including phase transition to the quark - gluon phase , should be tested within 3fd simulations .",
    "the present calculations provide a natural benchmark for the future analysis .",

    "the energy density and pressure are constructed as follows : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the energy density and pressure of relativistic hadronic gas , respectively , which depend on baryon density @xmath52 and temperature @xmath53 .",

    "basically we use the value @xmath6 210 mev ( intermediate eos ) .",

    "<S> collective transverse flow in heavy - ion collisions at incident energies @xmath0 ( 1160)@xmath1 gev is analyzed within the model of 3-fluid dynamics ( 3fd ) . </S>",
    "<S> simulations are performed with purely hadronic equation of state ( eos ) . at the ags energies the flow turns out to be sensitive to the stopping power of nuclear matter rather than only to the stiffness of the eos . </S>",
    "<S> when the stopping power is fixed to reproduce other observables , the flow data favor more and more soft eos with the incident energy rise , which can be associated with `` a transition from hadronic to string matter '' reported in the hadron - string - dynamics ( hsd ) model . </S>",
    "<S> problems , which are met in simultaneous reproduction of directed and elliptic flows within the 3fd , suggest that the transverse flow is very sensitive to the character of the transverse - momentum _ nonequilibrium _ at the initial stage of collision . </S>",
    "<S> arguments in favor of `` early - stage '' nature of the flow observable are put forward . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the flow ( especially the directed one ) is determined by early - stage evolution of the collision rather than freeze - out stage . </S>"
