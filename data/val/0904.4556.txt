    "the important feature of general relativity ( gr ) , the classical field theory describing gravity , is the fact that space - time is not simply a frame of coordinates , on which events take place , but is itself a dynamical entity .",
    "the quantisation of the theory , poses a problem , given that the coordinates of space - time themselves appear `` fuzzy '' .",
    "the fuzziness of space - time is associated with microscopic quantum fluctuations of the metric field , which may be singular .",
    "for instance , one may have planck size ( @xmath1 m ) black holes , emerging from the quantum gravity `` vacuum '' , which may give space - time a `` foamy '' , topologically non - trivial structure .",
    "the semi - classical study of black holes in gr has led to the prediction of hawking radiation . in classical gr simple solutions for black holes exhibit event horizons .",
    "this was interpreted quantum mechanically in terms of lack of communication between hilbert spaces within and outside the horizon .",
    "this is at the basis of the information paradox@xcite .",
    "simple arguments relating to tracing over states then lead to a description in terms of non - pure density matrices .",
    "these observations have led to a vigorous debate concerning the validity of unitary evolution for quantum gravity .",
    "initially s. hawking believed that there was information loss ; he and others have recently claimed  @xcite that information is not lost in the presence of a black hole , but rather it is entangled in a holographic way with the portion of space - time outside the horizon .",
    "there seems currently more and more adherents to this point of view .",
    "however in my opinion the situation is not resolved .",
    "this is primarily because we do not have a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "consequently there are always certain loose ends in the arguments that are proposed . as an example",
    "the original argument of hawking has been criticized  @xcite on the grounds that horizons are mathematical constructs and are not as physically relevant as trapping surfaces .",
    "it is then argued that evaporating black holes can evade the information paradox owing to the presence of an inner and outer trapping surface .",
    "the recent arguments of hawking and other ( string ) theorists are somewhat special in their details and require constructions such as the extremality of black holes , anti - de sitter ( supersymmetric ) space - times and the euclidean formulation for summing over space - time geometries .",
    "such considerations have led to a point of view labelled as holography and black hole complementarity@xcite,@xcite",
    ".the special features in these arguments make it hard to make general statements about unitarity or the lack of it in quantum evolution .",
    "we will take a somewhat different point of view which will put us firmly in the camp of those who believe that there is non - unitary evolution due to quantum gravity .",
    "much of the discussion using string theory is based on critical strings where the demands of world sheet conformal and target space lorentz invariance constrain the allowed values of space - time dimension ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "consequently changes in space - time backgrounds can not be accommodated .",
    "surely a proper theory of quantum gravity needs to be able to handle this .",
    "this is a fundamental problem .",
    "an approach which takes some steps to address these issues is based on the theory of non - critical strings@xcite also referred to as two dimensional gravity coupled to matter .",
    "the restoration of conformal invariance for a number of spatial dimensions different from the critical value is addressed through the introduction of the liouville field .",
    "furthermore by studying the recoil of branes and the induced backreaction on space - time , it possible to consider some situations where the space - time metric and hence geometry is changed . when @xmath2 space dimensional dirichlet ( dp ) branes are considered , it is no longer necessary to concentrate on the properties of microscopic black holes and the inherent issues of trapped surfaces .",
    "in particular dp branes with @xmath3 exist in some string theories such as bosonic , type iia and type i. furthermore even when elementary d particles can not exist consistently there can be effective d - particles formed by the compactification of higher dimensional d branes .",
    "moreover d particles are non - perturbative constructions since their masses are inversely proportional to the the string coupling @xmath4 .",
    "the introduction of the liouville field opens up also an interesting possibility .",
    "it was suggested by shore  @xcite that a renormalization group scale which was local on the world sheet was a useful way of analyzing string theory sigma models ( in the sense of the zamolodchikov c - function ) and subsequently  @xcite this scale was identified with the liouville field .",
    "furthermore the zero mode of the liouville field   can be identified with time on the basis of transformation properties of vertex operators associated with d particles @xcite .",
    "the zamolodchikov c theorem ( for general two dimensional field theories ) requires that the c - function ( a function in the space of all couplings , i.e. theory space ) is a non - negative and non - increasing function on a renormalization group trajectory .",
    "the renormalization group trajectory can be identified with temporal evolution as just intimated and this leads , because of the increase of entropy along the trajectories , to a non - unitary evolution for the density matrix @xmath5 .",
    "it will suffice for us to note that the evolution has the form @xmath6   + \\delta\\not h \\rho\\ , \\label{liouvqm}%\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the hamiltonian and @xmath8 is formally written as @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the so called zamolodchikov metric , @xmath11 is the renormalization group @xmath12 function for the couplings @xmath13 associated with vertex functions @xmath14 spanning theory space .",
    "although the identification of the liouville field with the local renormalization group scale is not rigorous , it is one important feature which influences our joining of the `` non - unitary '' camp .",
    "the other important reason for us is d - particle recoil which will be addressed in a later section .",
    "the second model to be considered by us is concerned with the effect of horizons and the consequent absence of unitarity but the formulation is not supported by a formal theory like string theory .",
    "a different effective theory of space - time foam has been proposed by garay @xcite .",
    "the fuzziness of space - time  at the planck scale is described by a non - fluctuating background which is supplemented by non - local interactions .",
    "the latter reflects the fact that at planck scales space - time points lose their meaning and so these fluctuations present themselves in the non - fluctuating coarse grained background as non - local interactions .",
    "these non - local interactions are then rephrased as a quantum thermal bath with a planckian temperature .",
    "the quantum entanglement of the gravitational bath and the two meson ( entangled ) state is explicit in this model .",
    "consequently issues of _ back reaction _ can be readily examined . since the evolution resulting from the standard lindblad formulation",
    "does not lead to the @xmath0 effect , this manifestation of cptv is not the result of some arbitrary non - unitary evolution .",
    "hence it is interesting to study the above two quite distinct models ( one motivated by string theory and the other by the properties of black holes in general relativity ) for clues concerning the appearance of ( and an estimate for the order of magnitude ) of @xmath0 .",
    "recently these fundamental issues have been brought into sharp focus through a phenomenological analysis involving correlated neutral meson pairs . for equations such as ( [ liouvqm ] )",
    ", it is well known that initial pure states evolve into mixed ones and so the s - matrix @xmath15 relating initial and final density matrices does not factorise , i.e. @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "this is another way  of saying that we have  non - unitary evolution . in these circumstances",
    "wald  @xcite has shown that cpt is violated , at least in its strong form , i.e. there is _ no _ unitary invertible operator @xmath18 such that @xmath19 this result is due to the entanglement of the gravitational fluctuations with the matter system .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite , that if the cpt operator is not well defined then this has implications for the symmetry structure of the initial entangled state of two neutral mesons in meson factories .",
    "indeed , if cpt can be defined as a quantum mechanical operator , then the decay of a ( generic ) meson with quantum numbers @xmath20 @xcite , leads to a pair state of neutral mesons @xmath21 having the form of the entangled state@xmath22 this state has the bose symmetry associated with particle - antiparticle indistinguishability @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the charge conjugation and @xmath25 is the permutation operation . if , however , cpt is not a good symmetry ( i.e. ill - defined due to space - time foam ) , then @xmath26 and @xmath27 may not be identified and the requirement of @xmath28 is relaxed  @xcite . consequently , in a perturbative framework , the state of the meson pair can be parametrised to have the following form : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is a complex cpt violating ( cptv ) parameter .",
    "for definiteness in what follows we shall term this quantum - gravity effect in the initial state as the @xmath0-effect@xcite .",
    "there is actually another dynamical @xmath0-effect  which is generated during the time evolution of the meson pair but this will not be discussed here @xcite .",
    "the structure of the article will be the following : we commence our analysis by discussing the omega effect.we will then proceed to discuss a string based model for the omega effect .",
    "the difficulty of generating the omega effect using other plausible approaches incorporating open systems and non - unitary master equations is illustrated through a class of models which we dub the thermal bath model .",
    "string theory was found , in the so called first revolution , to contain quantum gravity while in the second revolution the proposal of d(irichlet ) brane solitons  @xcite , together with dualities brought about relationships between the different string theories that had been proposed earlier .",
    "in particular zero dimensional d - branes @xcite occur ( in bosonic and some supersymmetric string theories ) and are known as d - particles .",
    "the spectrum of open strings attached to a dp brane ( with @xmath32 ) contains a maxwell field and the ends of the open string carry charge .",
    "the associated maxwell field is confined to the world volume of the d brane .",
    "hence a conventionally charged string can not end on a d - particle .",
    "we will thus restrict our consideration to neutral particles that are captured  by d - particles .",
    "the d - particle solitons are fundamental scalar particles in the dual theories .",
    "interactions in string theory are , as yet , not treated as systematically as in ordinary quantum field theory where a second quantised formalism is defined .",
    "the latter leads in a systematic way to the standard formulations by schwinger and feynman of perturbation series .",
    "when we consider stringy matter interacting with other matter or d - particles , the world lines traced out by point particles are replaced by two - dimensional world sheets .",
    "world sheets are the parameter space of the first quantised operators ( fermionic or bosonic ) representing strings . in this way the first quantised string is represented by actually a two dimensional ( world - sheet ) quantum field theory .",
    "an important symmetry of this first quantised string theory is conformal invariance and the requirement of the latter does determine the space - time dimension and/or structure .",
    "this symmetry leads to a scaling of the metric and permits the representation of interactions through the construction of measures on inequivalent riemann surfaces @xcite . in and out states of stringy matter",
    "are represented by punctures at the boundaries .",
    "the d - particles as solitonic states  @xcite in string theory do fluctuate themselves , and this is described by stringy excitations , corresponding to open strings with their ends attached to the d - particles . in the first quantised ( world - sheet ) language , such fluctuations are also described by riemann surfaces of higher topology with appropriate dirichlet boundary conditions ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : dbranes ] ) .",
    "the plethora of feynman diagrams in higher order quantum field theory is replaced by a small set of world sheet diagrams classified by moduli which need to be summed or integrated over @xcite .        in order to understand possible consequences for cpt due to space - time foam we will have to characterise the latter .",
    "the model we will consider is based on d - particles populating a bulk geometry between parallel d - brane worlds .",
    "the model is termed d - foam  @xcite ( c.f .",
    "figure [ fig : recoil ] ) , since our world is modelled as a three - brane moving in the bulk geometry . as a result ,",
    "d - particles cross the brane world , and thereby appear as foamy flashing on and off structures for an observer on the brane .    , which has a life time within the stringy uncertainty time interval @xmath33 , of the order of the string length , and is described by world - sheet logarithmic conformal field theory , is responsible for the distortion of the surrounding space time during the scattering , and subsequently leads to induced metrics depending on both coordinates and momenta of the string state .",

    "heuristically , when low energy matter given by a closed string propagating in a @xmath38-dimensional space - time collides with a very massive d - particle ( 0-brane ) embedded in this space - time , the d - particle recoils as a result @xcite .",
    "we shall consider the simple case of bosonic stringy matter coupling to d - particles and so we can only discuss matters of principle and ignore issues of stability",
    ". however we should note that an open string model needs to incorporate for completeness , higher dimensional d - branes such as the d3 brane .",
    "this is due to the vectorial charge carried by the string owing to the kalb - ramond field .",
    "higher dimensional d - branes ( unlike d - particles ) can carry the charge from the endpoints of open strings that are attached to them . for a closed bosonic string model",
    "the inclusion of such d - branes is not imperative ( see figure [ fig : recoil ] ) .",
    "the higher dimensional branes are not pertinent to our analysis however .",
    "the current state of phenomenolgical modelling of the interactions of d - particle foam with stringy matter will be briefly summarised now .",
    "since there are no rigid bodies in general relativity the recoil fluctuations of the brane and their effective stochastic back - reaction on space - time can not be neglected .",
    "as we will discuss , d - particle recoil in the  tree approximation ",
    "i.e. in lowest order in the string coupling @xmath39 , corresponds to the punctured disc or riemann sphere approximation in open or closed string theory , induces a non - trivial space - time metric .",
    "for closed strings colliding with a heavy ( non - relativistic ) d - particle the metric has the form @xcite @xmath40 here the suffix @xmath41 denotes temporal ( liouville ) components , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the momentum of the propagating closed - string state before ( after ) the recoil , @xmath45 are the spatial collective coordinates of the d- particle and @xmath46 is identified with the target minkowski time @xmath47 for @xmath48 after the collision ; @xmath49 is the regularised step function represented by @xmath50 and @xmath51 is small , . for our purposes",

    "the stochasticity is due to two contributions .",
    "the d - particle has an initial random recoil velocity due to capture of stringy matter and subsequent release .",
    "furthermore sumperimposed on this randomness are quantum fluctuations due to vacuum string excitations.the process of capture and emission does not have to conserve flavour .",
    "consequently we need to generalise the stochastic structure to allow for this.the fluctuations of each component of the metric tensor @xmath58 will then not be just given by the simple recoil distortion ( [ recoilmetric ] ) , but instead will be taken to have a @xmath59 ( `` flavour '' ) structure @xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath61 , is the identity operator and @xmath62 are  the pauli matrices and the @xmath63 are random variables which obey@xmath64 the above parametrisation has been taken for simplicity and also we will consider motion to be in the @xmath65- direction which is natural since the meson pairs move collinearly .",

    "also does not lead to the @xmath0-effect .",
    "one can not gainsay that other more complicated models of ` thermal ' baths may display the @xmath0-effect but clearly a rather standard model rejects quite emphatically the possibility of such an effect .",
    "this by itself is very interesting .",
    "it shows that the @xmath0-effect is far from a generic possibility for space - time foams . just as it is remarkable that various versions of the paradigmatic ` thermal ' bath can not accommodate the @xmath102-effect , it also remarkable that the d - particle foam model manages to do so very simply .",
    "in this work we have discussed two classes of space - time foam models , which may characterise realistic situations of the ( still elusive ) theory of quantum gravity . in one of the models , inspired by non - critical string theory",
    ", string mattter on a brane world interacts with d particles in the bulk .",
    "recoil of the heavy d particles owing to interactions with the stringy matter produces a gravitational distortion which has a backreaction on the stringy matter .",
    "this distortion , consistent with a logarithmic conformal field theory algebra , depens on the recoil velocity of the d - particle .",
    "it is modelled by a stochastic metric and consequently can affect the different mass eigenstates of neutral mesons.there are two contributions to the stochasticity .",
    "one is due to the stochastic aspects of the recoil velocity found in low order loop amplitudes of open or closed strings ( performed explicitly in the bosonic string theory model ) while the other is the leading behaviour of an infinite resummation of the subleading order infrared divergences in loop perturbation theory .",
    "the former is assumed to fluctuate randomly , with a dispersion which is viewed as a phenomenological parameter .",
    "the latter for long enough capture times of the d - particle with stringy matter gives a calculable dispersion which dominates the phenomenological dispersion for the usual expectations of the quantum gravity scale .",
    "this gives a prediction for the order of magnitude of the cptv @xmath0-like effect in the initial entangled state of two neutral mesons in a meson factory based on stationary ( non degenerate ) perturbation theory for the gravitational dressing of the correlated meson state.the klein - gordon hamiltonian in the induced stochastic gravitiational field was used for the calculation of the dressing.the order of magnitude of @xmath0 may not be far from the sensitivity of immediate future experimental facilities , such as a possible upgrade of the da@xmath230ne detector or a b - meson factory .",
    "this causes a cptv @xmath0-like effect in the initial entangled state of two neutral mesons in a meson factory , of the type conjectured in @xcite . using stationary perturbation theory it was possible to give an order of magnitude estimate of the effect : the latter is momentum dependent , and of an order which may not be far from the sensitivity of immediate future experimental facilities , such as a possible upgrade of the da@xmath230ne detector or a b - meson factory . a similar effect , but with a sinusoidal time dependence , and hence experimentally disentanglable from the initial - state effect , is also generated in this model of foam by the evolution of the system .    a second model of space - time foam , that of a thermal bath of gravitational degrees of freedom",
    ", is also considered in our work , which , however , does not lead to the generation of an @xmath0-effect .",
    "compared to the initial treatment of thermal baths further significant generalisations have been considered here . in the initial treatment ( using a model derived in the rotating wave approximation ) the structure of the hamiltonian matrix was block diagonal ,",
    "the blocks being invariant 4-dimensional subspaces.the real signifcance of the block diagonal structure was unclear for the absence of the omega effect in this model and has remained a matter for debate .",
    "we have analyzed the model ( now without the rotating wave approximation ) and to  our surprise the omega effect is still absent .",
    "furthermore we have also considered @xmath122 oscillators for the heat bath modes since from matrix theory we know that energetic d - particles satisfy @xmath122 statistics . for the model of @xmath122 statistics that we have adopted",
    "there is again no @xmath0-effect in the @xmath122 version of the thermal bath .",
    "it is interesting to continue the search for other ( and more ) realistic models of quantum gravity , either in the context of string theory or in alternative approaches , such as loop quantum gravity , exhibiting intrinsic cpt violating effects in sensitive matter probes .",
    "detailed analyses of global data in relation to cptv , including very sensitive probes such as high energy neutrinos , is a good way forward .",
