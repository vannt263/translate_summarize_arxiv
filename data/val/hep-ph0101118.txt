    "two - body charmless @xmath5 decays are studied as a mean to detect direct cp - violation and to determine the ckm mixing parameters in the standard model @xcite . in these processes",
    "the short - distance contributions can be computed by using the factorization approximation for the local operators in the effective non - leptonic hamiltonian @xmath6 as argued by bjorken on the basis of color - transparency @xcite and recently justified in @xcite .",
    "however non - leading @xmath7 effects which appears in the penguin matrix elements may be numerically important . in some cases where experimental data are available",
    "this approach does meet difficulties ( for a discussion see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "an example is offered by the decay @xmath1 .",
    "the branching ratios for these processes have been measured by the cleo collaboration @xcite : @xmath8 and , more recently , by the babar @xcite and belle @xcite collaborations .",

    "if one now evaluates the amplitudes for these decays by including only tree and penguin operators , without taking into account the charm quark loop , the factorization approximation produces branching ratios too small as compared to the data @xcite .    to get a better agreement one",
    "is forced to include the so - called charming penguin operators , i.e. those operators which , being proportional to the large ckm factor @xmath15 and the large wilson coefficient @xmath16 , are not suppressed like the tree and penguin contributions .",
    "two approaches can be followed to include these effects .",
    "one may define effective wilson coefficients by considering the effect of a charm quark loop treated perturbatively @xcite ; in this way also an absorptive part of the non - leptonic decay amplitude is generated .",
    "this approach , used together with the factorization approximation , seems to produce decay rates in agreement with data , at least qualitatively , as shown in some previous papers @xcite . in these",
    "works the inclusion of the charm quark loop increases the effective wilson coefficients of the strong penguin operators by about @xmath17 , thereby producing @xmath18 decay rates closer to the data .",
    "more recently charm quark effects computed by this method have been included in works dealing with the validity of the factorization @xcite .",
    "a different approach can however be followed .",
    "it assumes that the charm quark contributions are basically long - distance effects that can be taken into account by including rescattering processes such as , e.g. @xmath19 .",
    "these contributions , first discussed to our knowledge in @xcite , have been more recently stressed by @xcite , where they are called charming penguin terms , a nomenclature we shall adopt here .    the aim of this paper is to present an evaluation of the charming penguins in the @xmath1 decays going beyond the parametrizations of @xcite . as a matter of fact ,",
    "instead of considering only @xmath20 intermediate states , we will also consider charmed vector mesons .",
    "is saturated by @xmath21 at zero recoil @xcite .",
    "though we are not in this limit , the approximation can be used as a guideline . ] furthermore , by using phenomenological information from semileptonic decays and chiral effective lagrangean , we shall estimate both the real and the imaginary part of the charming penguins .",
    "this result , being an improved determination of the strong phase , might be of some utility in connections with strategies to determine the angle @xmath22 of the unitarity triangle from future more precise data .",
    "the long - distance absorptive part is essentially due to the rescattering effects of the processes @xmath23 .",
    "the situation is similar to the @xmath24 decay for which the absorptive part obtained in @xcite is comparable to the short - distance contribution . as noted above , the dispersive part of the charming penguins , in the present approximation , was computed previously in @xcite for a number of charmless @xmath5 decays to two pseudo - scalar mesons as well as one pseudo - scalar and one vector meson in the final states . in this paper",
    "we present a new calculation of the long - distance contribution using the same cottingham formula @xcite , and more recent information on the semileptonic decay form factors .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the separation between the short - distance and the long - distance contributions . in section 3 ,",
    "the absorptive part is shown in terms of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 amplitudes obtained by the short - distance non - leptonic hamiltonian and the @xmath27 and @xmath28 semileptonic decay form factors .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the calculation of the dispersive part ( the real part ) of the @xmath29 amplitudes . finally in section 5",
    "we compare our results to the data and draw our conclusions .",
    "the non - leptonic @xmath0 decay amplitude is obtained by considering the matrix element @xmath30 the effective hamiltonian for non - leptonic @xmath5 decays is the sum of 4-quark tree - level and penguin operators and is given by @xmath31 \\label{heff}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 are the wilson coefficients evaluated at the normalization scale @xmath33 @xcite and next - to - leading qcd radiative corrections are included . @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the usual tree - level operators , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) are the penguin operators and @xmath38 is the chromomagnetic gluon operator .",

    "therefore one has to relax some of the hypotheses .",
    "the possibility we explore here is to consider non - factorizable contributions . in this case",
    "also the operators @xmath55 ( @xmath45 ) are effective ; these terms will be treated as long - distance contributions , i.e. we will go beyond vacuum saturation and consider intermediate low energy hadronic states in the product of the weak currents in the operators of ( [ heff ] ) .",
    "also other operators in ( [ heff ] ) have long - distance contributions , but clearly @xmath56 is dominated by @xmath57 due to the enhancement of the ckm factor @xmath15 and the wilson coefficient @xmath58",

    "to this aim we introduce two modifications : * i ) * we keep the full propagator in the pole contributions instead of the expressions in the soft pion limit ( a similar use of the full @xmath94 propagator to go beyond the soft pion result has also been given in @xcite ) ; * ii ) * we introduce a form factor in the strong coupling constant of light and heavy mesons ( a similar approach is used in semileptonic decays @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider the @xmath95 coupling that can be written in general as follows : @xmath96 from ( [ strong-3 ] ) we have @xmath97 where @xmath98 is independent of the heavy flavor and is predicted to have the value ( see @xcite and references therein ) : @xmath99 we shall neglect @xmath100 effects in this case and shall adopt this value .",
    "there is , however , an important point to be discussed here .",
    "the expression ( [ g ] ) is derived from the low momentum chiral effective lagrangean ( [ strong-3 ] ) .",

    "the coupling constant @xmath98 in the soft pion limit is proportional to the overlap of the @xmath94 and @xmath109 wave functions : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is some smooth function whose precise shape depends on the particular model one employs , but it is irrelevant for our purposes . we therefore get , if the pion momentum is @xmath112 @xmath113 where the denominator has been introduced to normalize correctly the form factor .",
    "we employ for the wave function the expression : @xmath114 which corresponds to an average quark momentum @xmath115 inside the meson and we assume a constant value for the smooth function @xmath111 .",

    "we get therefore @xmath119 where the central value corresponds to @xmath120 mev and the higher ( lower ) to @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) mev .",
    "it should be observed that also the lagrangean @xmath123 and the weak current @xmath124 have corrections from terms containing higher order derivatives .",
    "however these terms do not contribute to the imaginary part of @xmath56 ; on the other hand hard pion and kaon effects in the calculation of to the real part can be taken into account by an appropriate cut - off of the cottingham formula .",
    "we will discuss the problem in section 4 .",
    "it can be easily seen that only diagrams [ ff2]c and [ ff2]d contribute to the discontinuity of @xmath56 .",
    "the diagrams [ ff2]a and [ ff2]b have no discontinuity , whereas the diagram [ ff2]e vanishes in the chiral limit and we neglect it altogether . as to the diagram [ ff2]f , both its imaginary and its real part",

    "the real part due to the @xmath136 states is however @xmath137 times bigger and opposite in sign to the contributions from the @xmath20 states .",
    "as shown in table 1 and table 2 , the total contribution for the real part and absorptive part are of the same order of magnitude , at the @xmath138 level .",

    "charged @xmath5 decays into @xmath152 .",
    "let us finally discuss the problem of the scaling of our results with @xmath153 .",
    "assuming , as in @xcite , that @xmath154 scales as @xmath155 , @xmath43 scales as @xmath156 . on the other hand the charming penguin contribution @xmath56",
    "is non leading due to the various form factors which vanish for @xmath157 .",
    "therefore the following conclusion can be drawn .",
    "the charming penguin contributions violate naive factorization and are of leading order in @xmath158 , as they arise from non perturbative calculations ; nevertheless they do not contradict the results of @xcite since they are suppressed in the infinite heavy quark mass limits . in spite of that , as @xmath159 in reality are finite , the charming penguin numerical contribution to the branching ratios in @xmath1 decays is significant , basically due to the enhancement of the ckm matrix elements .    in conclusion",
    ", we believe that the charmed resonance contributions we found seem to be capable of producing the charming - penguin terms suggested in @xcite within theoretical errors .",
    "this method could then be applied also to other two - body nonleptonic @xmath5 decay channels , such as the @xmath160 and the @xmath161 .",
    "we only mention here a result for the charming - penguin contribution in @xmath162 decay .",
    "this contribution can be obtained from the results we obtained for @xmath163 using @xmath164 symmetry for the weak current matrix elements @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "thus , in the @xmath164 limit(by ignoring the @xmath167 mass difference ) @xcite @xmath168 since the @xmath169 decay is dominated by the tree - level operators , this charming - penguin contribution behaves like the penguin terms and reduces the @xmath162 decay rate by a small amount .",
