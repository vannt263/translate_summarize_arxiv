    "one of the focus areas of the unedf scidac collaboration @xcite has been the description of the fission process within a self - consistent framework based on nuclear density functional theory ( dft ) . until now ,",
    "attempts at going beyond the macroscopic - microscopic methods @xcite have been carried in the context of the original self - consistent nuclear mean - field theory @xcite with skyrme ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , gogny ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and relativistic ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) energy density functionals ( edfs ) .",
    "the fundamental assumption of the nuclear dft is that one can describe accurately a broad range of phenomena in nuclei , including excited states and large - amplitude collective motion , by enriching the density dependence of the functional while staying at the single - reference hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) level . in this picture , beyond - mean - field corrections are implicitly built - in .",
    "preliminary studies aimed at re - examining the old problem of restoring broken symmetries in this context are promising @xcite .",
    "a common challenge to both the self - consistent mean field and the dft approach is the need to carefully optimize the edf parameters to the preselected pool of observables @xcite . in particular ,",
    "special attention must be paid to optimize the parameters in the same regime where the theory will later be applied and to choose the fit observables accordingly . in a recent work @xcite , we showed that existing skyrme edfs exhibit a significant spread in bulk deformation properties , and re - emphasized @xcite that the resulting theoretical uncertainties could be greatly reduced by considering data corresponding to large deformation in the optimization process .",
    "let us recall that the early skyrme - type edf skm@xmath1 @xcite was in fact optimized for fission studies in the actinide region by considering the experimental information on the fission barrier of @xmath0pu .",
    "however , the optimization was not performed directly at the deformed hfb level ; instead , a semi - classical approach was used based on the thomas - fermi approximation together with shell - correction techniques .",
    "the d1s parameterization of the finite - range gogny force was also fine - tuned to the first barrier height of @xmath0pu @xcite , considering a rotational correction to the energy of the deformed state . however , this fine - tuning again was not done directly at the hfb level but by a manual readjustment of the surface coefficient of the edf using a phenomenological model .",
    "also , in the bsk14 edf of the hfb-14 mass model @xcite by the bruxelles - montral collaboration , data on fission barriers were utilized to optimize the edf parameters by adding phenomenological collective corrections , including a rotational one .",
    "one may , therefore , conclude that no edf has ever been systematically optimized at the deformed hfb level ( and without phenomenological corrections added ) by explicitly considering constraints on states at large deformations .    in a previous study @xcite",
    ", we applied modern optimization and statistical methods , together with high - performance computing , to carry out edf optimization at the deformed hfb level , namely , the approximation level where the functional is later applied .",
    "the resulting edf parameterization unedf0 yields good agreement with experimental masses , radii , and deformations .",
    "the present work represents an extension of @xcite to the problem of fission .",
    "in particular , it builds on the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , which concluded that the data on strongly deformed nuclear states should be considered in the optimization protocol to constrain the surface properties of the functional .",
    "here we propose the new edf skyrme parameterization , unedf1 , which is obtained by adding to the list of fit observables the experimental excitation energies of fission isomers in the actinides . to ensure that the functional can be used in fission and fusion studies , we have removed the center - of - mass ( c.o.m . )",
    "correction in the spirit of the dft . as in the case of unedf0",
    ", a sensitivity analysis has been performed at the solution in order to identify possible correlations between model parameters and assess the impact of the new class of fit observables on the resulting parameterization .",

    "the coulomb contribution is treated as usual by assuming a point proton charge .",
    "the exchange term was computed at the slater approximation : @xmath28    for the pairing energy density @xmath9 , we use the mixed pairing description of @xcite with @xmath29\\tilde\\rho^2({\\boldsymbol{r } } ) \\ , , \\label{eq : vpair}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the local pairing density .",

    "a cut - off of @xmath35 was used to truncate the quasi - particle space @xcite . to prevent the collapse of pairing",
    ", we used the lipkin - nogami procedure according to @xcite .",
    "the success of the self - consistent mean - field theory is , to a great extent , due to the concept of symmetry breaking .",
    "a classic example is the breaking of the translational invariance by the mean field that is localized in space .",
    "the associated c.o.m .",
    "correction to the binding energy @xcite , @xmath36 , is usually added to the dft binding energy in ( [ edft ] ) .",

    "moreover , it was shown that adopting approximations to this correction during the optimization of the functional could lead to significantly different surface properties @xcite .    since the c.o.m .",
    "correction is not additive in particle number , it causes serious conceptual problems when dealing with fission or heavy - ion fusion , that is , when one considers the split of the nucleus into several fragments , or formation of the compound nucleus through a merger of two lighter ions . in fission studies",
    ", it was shown that the contribution of the c.o.m .",
    "correction between the two prefragments could amount to several mev near scission @xcite .",
    "moreover , properly computing this relative contribution is difficult , as it reflects the degree of entanglement between prefragments @xcite .",
    "time - dependent hartree - fock calculations of low - energy heavy - ion reactions are even more problematic , as there is currently no solution to the discontinuity of the c.o.m .",
    "correction between the target+projectile system and the compound nucleus @xcite : such calculations usually neglect the c.o.m .",
    "term altogether , even though edfs employed in such calculations have been usually fitted with the c.o.m .",
    "correction included .",
    "there are , however , some exceptions , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "note that the same problem occurs with the so - called rotational correction arising from the breaking of rotational invariance by deformed mean fields @xcite .",
    "another undesired property of the c.o.m .",
    "correction is that it slightly breaks the variational nature of hfb when adding or subtracting a particle @xcite , i.e. , it violates the koopmans theorem .",
    "the resulting s.p .",
    "energy shifts are quite significant and they are of the order of the mass polarization effect related to the fact that when adding or subtracting a particle to a closed spherical core , the resulting nucleus becomes deformed . if a spherical symmetry is imposed , the mass polarization effect is a self - consistent rearrangement of all nucleons , when an odd particle is introduced to the system .",
    "this corresponding energy shift is @xmath37 , i.e. , about 0.4  mev in @xmath38ca @xcite .    as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec - introduction ] , the edf is supposed to capture all the physics of interest at the hfb level . in other words ,",
    "the functional is to be built from the full single - reference density matrix .",
    "while the hfb vacuum breaks the translational symmetry , the associated correction term should be absorbed in the density dependence .",
    "in particular , it should be possible to express the c.o.m .",
    "term not as an explicit function of @xmath39 , as currently being done , but through a density functional .",
    "until a simple prescription is proposed , however , it is more consistent to simply drop all corrections that originate from a hamiltonian view of the problem , including the c.o.m .  term . and , since our focus in on fission",
    ", this is precisely what we have done in this work .",
    "since the focus of this study is the construction of an edf optimized for fission , our experimental dataset has been expanded by including the excitation energies ( bandheads ) of four fission isomers ( fis ) listed in table [ table : newdata ] . the ground - state ( g.s . )",
    "binding energies of @xmath40u , @xmath0pu , and @xmath41 cm , not included in the previous unedf0 dataset @xcite , were added for consistency ( the g.s .",
    "energy of @xmath42u was already there ) .",
    ".experimental excitation energies of fission isomers @xcite ( in mev ) considered in the unedf1 dataset . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     figure  [ fig : de ] displays the binding energy residuals ( i.e. , deviations from experiment ) . from this figure and table  [ table : masstablerms ] , we can see a couple of trends .",
    "first , the energy residuals with unedf1 are larger than those for unedf0 .",
    "this result is not surprising , as the new data on fi and the removal of the center - of - mass correction strongly disfavors the lightest nuclei during the optimization process .",
    "second , the characteristic arc - like behavior between the magic numbers is pronounced , although this trend is much weaker than , for example , for the sly4 functional ( see fig . 7 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : ds2n ] we display the residuals of two - neutron and two - proton separation energies .",
    "again , the emphasis of @xmath43 on heavy nuclei is clearly seen , and the corresponding rms deviations in table  [ table : masstablerms ] quantify this feature .",
    "notice that two - proton separation energies are systematically overestimated . the same trend is observed for the unedf0 functional .",
    "we can speculate about sources for this effect : ( i ) following the arguments of @xcite , one may argue that the standard skyrme functionals , such as unedf0 and unedf1 , lack the capability to describe many - body coulomb effects ; ( ii ) the explicit contribution of the coulomb field to the pairing channel @xcite is not taken into account . it is expected that separate pairing strengths for neutrons and protons , as in unedf1 , will partly account for this missing contribution @xcite",
    ". however , the existence of nontrivial correlations between pairing strengths and other parameters of the functional ( see table [ table : correlation ] ) may have consequences for observables such as two - proton separation energies .        to compare unedf0 and unedf1 quantitatively",
    ", we can assess their performance on various observables listed in table  [ table : masstablerms ] .",
    "it is expected that since new constraints on fission isomers have been added when optimizing unedf1 while keeping the same number of parameters optimized , the rms deviations for masses and separation energies must increase .",
    "indeed , the rms deviation for the masses is slightly worse for unedf1 , for both light and heavy nuclei .",
    "interestingly , the quality of @xmath44 values remains roughly the same in both cases , as is true also for odd - even mass differences and proton radii .",
    "the nuclear shell structure has a substantial impact on many nuclear properties .",
    "notably , the single - particle levels close to the fermi surface affect many nuclear properties such as the strength of pairing correlations and deformability . compared with our previous work @xcite , the s.p .",
    "energies that we report here have been obtained from proper blocking calculations at the hfb+ln level @xcite , instead of being the eigenvalues of the hf hamiltonian .",
    "this choice is motivated by the need to stay within a logically consistent framework : both unedf0 and unedf1 have been optimized at the hfb+ln level , and hence should be employed exclusively in this context . moreover , in the nuclear mean - field theory with effective interactions , hf eigenvalues are a poor representation of s.p .",
    "energies ; see @xcite for a recent study . in a dft approach , however , it is assumed that the generalized form of the energy density may effectively account for beyond mean - field effects such as particle - vibration couplings .",
    "in addition to this theoretical argument , let us recall that s.p .",
    "energies are not observables but model - dependent quantities extracted experimentally from binding energies of excited states in odd nuclei .",
    "systematic errors can thus be reduced by working exclusively with binding energies .",
    "pb , calculated with unedf0 and unedf1 edfs compared to the experimental values of ref",
    ".  @xcite . ]    to this end , we computed a number of one - quasi - particle ( q.p . ) configurations for the odd - mass neighbors of @xmath45o , @xmath38ca , @xmath46ca , @xmath47ni , @xmath48sn , and @xmath49pb .",
    "calculations were done at the equal filling approximation , which is an excellent approximation to the full time - reversal , symmetry - breaking blocking scheme @xcite . blocking q.p .",
    "states induces a small shape polarization @xcite , which in turn leads to a fragmentation of spherical s.p .",
    "orbitals of angular momentum @xmath50 into @xmath51 levels @xmath52 . in principle , the `` experimental '' s.p",
    ".  energy should be the average energy over all the @xmath51 blocking configurations .",
    "however , a state with the projection @xmath53 can belong to any spherical orbit @xmath54 , which could potentially complicate the identification for low-@xmath53 values .",
    "we therefore associate a spherical orbit with spin @xmath50 to the blocking configuration with the maximum projection @xmath55 .",
    "we have verified that the amount of splitting in all these nuclei does not exceed 150 kev : for the proton @xmath56 orbit in @xmath49pb , it is 77 kev , and for the neutron 1@xmath57 state in @xmath38ca , it is 124 kev .",
    "this implies that the error induced by cherry - picking a single state out of a @xmath51 nondegenerate candidate instead of the average is only on the order of 60 kev .",
    "figure  [ fig : spe208p ] compares single - proton energies in @xmath49pb computed with unedf0 and unedf1 with the experimental values .",
    "although the differences between these two functionals are small , we note that unedf1 improves slightly the description of several high-@xmath50 levels except for a too low position of the 1@xmath58 proton orbit that reduces the size of the @xmath59=82 proton gap .",
    "the situation is similar for the neutron single - particle energies in @xmath49pb .",
    "for both unedf0 and unedf1 the effective mass is close to one , which probably explains the fairly good reproduction of the level density in @xmath49pb . in the lighter doubly magic nuclei ,",
    "differences between unedf0 and unedf1 s.p .",
    "energies are somewhat larger .",
    "the magic gaps in ca isotopes are now better reproduced , although the @xmath60 gap in @xmath46ca is still too low .",
    "table [ table : sd ] lists the excitation energies of superdeformed ( sd ) fission isomers in the actinide region and sd bandheads in the mass @xmath61 region calculated with the unedf0 and unedf1 parameterizations .",
    "contrary to fission isomers , sd bandheads in neutron - deficient lead and mercury isotopes were not included in the objective function , since the prolate - oblate shape coexistence effects , not captured by current functionals , are well known in these nuclei @xcite .",
    "indeed , calculations with unedf1 predict an oblate ground state at @xmath62=@xmath63 ",
    "@xmath64 in all the hg - pb isotopes considered , coexisting with a slightly higher spherical minimum . by contrast , the ground state of the three lead isotopes is spherical with unedf0 .",

    "there seems to exist an interesting relation between barrier heights and the surface thickness .",
    "we have evaluated the surface thickness in @xmath49pb from the charge form factor @xmath97 as defined , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite and found @xmath98fm for unedf0 and @xmath99fm for unedf1 .",
    "this is to be compared with the measured value of @xmath100fm @xcite .",
    "it is apparent that the edf which does well on fission barriers also performs well for surface thickness .",
    "the functionals sv - min and sv - bas which included @xmath97 in the fit , and yield values around 0.91 fm for this quantity , happen to perform well concerning barrier heights @xcite .",
    "the relation between fission barriers and surface thickness deserves closer inspection in future work .",
    "recently , there has been a considerable interest in studies of inhomogeneous neutron matter by considering finite systems of @xmath101 neutrons ; specifically , neutron drops @xcite .",
    "since neutron drops are not self - bound @xcite , an external potential must be used to confine them . by studying neutron drops",
    ", one can test different ab initio approaches and their correspondence to dft calculations @xcite ; investigate the validity of the density matrix expansion @xcite ; and develop a theoretical link between neutron - rich nuclei and the neutron matter found in the neutron star crust @xcite .",
    "-neutron drops trapped in a ho potential with @xmath102mev and 10mev with the afdmc ab initio results of ref .",
    "@xcite . ]    figure [ fig : ndroplets ] presents the results of unedf0 and unedf1 calculations for neutron drops confined by two external ho traps with @xmath102mev and 10 mev .",
    "the dft results are compared with ab initio afdmc benchmark calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite employing the av8 nucleon - nucleon and urbana ix three - nucleon force .",
    "as can be seen , unedf0 reproduces afdmc results well , especially since the functional has not been constrained to finite neutron matter .",
    "the agreement with unedf1 calculations is also good , especially for a softer trap with @xmath102mev .    in future edf optimizations",
    "we shall include ab initio predictions for neutron drops into the dataset . by providing unique constraints on finite neutron matter",
    ", such pseudo - data are expected to improve the description of very neutron - rich nuclei and diluted neutron matter .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ fig : ndroplets ] indicate that unedf0 and unedf1 functionals represent excellent starting points for such optimizations .",
    "by performing nuclear energy density optimization at the deformed hfb level , we have arrived at the new skyrme parameterization unedf1 .",
    "our main focus was to improve the description of fission properties of the actinide nuclei and to provide a high - quality functional for time - dependent applications involving heavy systems .",
    "the only notable change in the form of the energy density as compared with our previous work @xcite was the removal of the center - of - mass correction . for the @xmath103-minimization",
    ", we used the derivative - free pounders algorithm . compared with unedf0 ,",
    "the dataset was enlarged by adding ground - state masses of three deformed actinide nuclei and excitation energies of fission isomers in @xmath77u , @xmath0pu , and @xmath41 cm . for the optimal parameter set",
    ", we carried out a sensitivity analysis to obtain information about the standard deviations and correlations among the parameters .",
    "we conclude that unedf1 remains as robust under a change of individual data as unedf0 .",
    "overall , unedf1 provides a description of global nuclear properties that is almost as good as that of unedf0 .",
    "not surprising , the quality of data reproduction is slightly degraded : by adding a new type of data ( fission isomers ) , one is likely to worsen the fit for other observables .",
    "the most striking feature of unedf1 is its ability to reproduce the empirical fission barriers in the actinide region .",
    "we find it encouraging that , by including only a handful of fission isomer bandheads , deformation properties of the functional seem well constrained .",
    "another unanticipated property of unedf0 and unedf1 is their ability to reproduce ab initio results for trapped neutron drops .",
    "this is significant because such pseudo - data will be used in future edf optimizations .",
    "in addition to imposing new constraints on neutron drops , in the next step we intend to improve the spectroscopic quality of unedf functionals by considering the experimental data on spin - orbit splittings and shell gaps .",
    "we shall also improve the density dependence of the kinetic term by adding new constraints on giant resonances .",
    "meanwhile , the functional unedf1 developed in this work will be the input of choice for microscopic studies of the nuclear fission process .",
    "we are grateful to a. staszczak and j.  mor for helpful discussions .",
