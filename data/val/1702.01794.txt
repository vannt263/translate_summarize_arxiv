    "with the advent of complex cyber - physical systems ( cps ) and industrial internet - of - thing , the safety of integrated cyber - physical systems has become an important design feature that must be incorporated in all software levels @xcite . in particular",
    ", this feature must also be present in the low - level control systems where both aspects of safety and stability are integrated in the control design for safety - critical systems , such as , biomedical devices , smart infrastructure systems , and smart energy systems .    for the past few years",
    ", a number of control design methods have been proposed in literature on the design of feedback controller that can guarantee both the safety and stability , simultaneously . to name a few ,",
    "we refer interested readers to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in @xcite and @xcite , the authors proposed an optimization problem , in the form of a quadratic programming , where both control lyapunov and control barrier inequalities are formulated in the constraints .",
    "the proposed method generalizes the well - known pointwise min - norm control method for designing a control law using control lyapunov functions via an optimization problem @xcite .",
    "it has been successfully implemented in the cruise control of autonomous vehicle as reported in @xcite .",
    "another direct approach is pursued in @xcite which is based on the direct merging of control lyapunov function and control barrier function .",
    "the merging process results in a control lyapunov - barrier function which can be used to stabilize the system with guaranteed safety by using sontag s universal control law .    despite the appealing idea in the aforementioned works for guaranteeing stability and safety ,",
    "it remains unclear on how to analyze the robustness of the closed - loop system in the presence of external ( disturbance ) input signals .",
    "there are many tools available for analyzing the robustness of systems stability , including , @xmath0 and @xmath1-stability theories @xcite , absolute stability theory @xcite , input - to - state stability ( iss ) theory @xcite and many others .",
    "however , analogous tools for systems safety are still lacking which makes it difficult to carry out robustness analysis to the aforementioned results that deal with the problem of stabilization with guaranteed safety .    the seminal work in @xcite on the characterization of input - to - state stability has been one of the most important tools in the stability analysis of nonlinear systems .",
    "it has allowed us to study stability of interconnected systems , to quantify systems robustness with respect to external disturbances and to provide means for constructing a robustly stabilizing control law .",
    "the use of iss lyapunov function is crucial in all of these applications . in the following decade",
    ", the concept of iss has been used and/or generalized in various directions with a commonality on the robustness analysis of systems stability .",
    "however , safety and constraint aspects have not been considered in this framework . by considering the complement of the set of unsafe state",
    ", one might consider to apply recent generalization of iss to the stability of invariant sets as in @xcite .",
    "but it may not give us an insightful detail on the influence of external disturbance signals to the state of safety of the system .",
    "in this case , the resulting iss inequality will only provide us information on the effect of external input to the systems trajectory with respect to the complement set of unsafe state , but not on how far it is from being unsafe .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new notion of input - to - state safety which is an adaptation of iss inequality to the systems safety case .",
    "in particular , instead of the usual iss inequality where the state trajectory @xmath2 of the system can be bounded from above by a term that depends on initial condition and decays to zero and another term that depends on the @xmath3-norm of the external input signal @xmath4 , we look at the following inequality @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the set of unsafe state , @xmath7 denotes the distance of @xmath8 to @xmath6 , the function @xmath9 is strictly increasing function , @xmath10 is strictly increasing function in both arguments , @xmath11 and @xmath12 as the gain function that is dependent on input @xmath13 , akin to the iss case . as will be discussed later in section 3 , the inequality : will be called input - to - state safety ( issf ) inequality .",
    "roughly speaking , this inequality can be interpreted as follows .",
    "when there is no external input signal @xmath13 , then the state trajectory will never get closer to @xmath6 .",
    "on the other hand , if there is an external input signal then it may jeopardize the systems safety when the input signal @xmath13 is taken sufficiently large .",
    "the above interpretation serves very well with what we can expect in real systems where external disturbance input can potentially bring the system into the unsafe state .",
    "_ in @xcite has presented also a preliminary study on the robustness aspect for systems safety where they provide an indirect relationship between the external input norm to the admissible initial conditions such that the system remains safe .",
    "this relationship is also captured in : where if the bound on the input signal is known then the inequality : will make sense only if the initial conditions are bounded away from @xmath6 by a constant that depends on the input norm .",
    "complementary to the work of xu _ etal .",
    "_ in @xcite , we adapt the iss framework ala sontag to the systems safety case through the use of issf barrier function which implies : .",
    "preliminary work on this concept has been presented in @xcite which is restricted to the case of exponential input - to - state safety . in this paper",
    ", we extend it to general nonlinear case , as well as to the analysis of feedback interconnection .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly recall the notion of stabilization with guaranteed safety , of iss and of barrier certificate . in section 3 , we introduce formally the notion of input - to - state safety and its characterization using issf barrier function . in section 4 , we provide a numerical example of the aforementioned results for a simple mobile robot navigation system .",
    "* notation*. throughout this paper , we consider an affine non - linear system described by @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes a state vector , @xmath16 denotes an ( external ) input or disturbance to the system .",
    "the functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 are @xmath19 where the space",
    "@xmath20 consists of all continuously differentiable functions @xmath21 . without loss of generality and for simplicity of presentation",
    ", we will assume throughout that the solution to : is complete ( i.e. , it exists for all @xmath22 ) for any bounded signal @xmath13 .",
    "this assumption holds when the system has the input - to - state stability property which we will recall shortly .    for a given signal @xmath23 ,",
    "its @xmath24 norm is given by @xmath25 for @xmath26 and its @xmath3 norm is defined by @xmath27 . for a given bounded set @xmath28 , we define the distance of a point @xmath29 with respect to @xmath30 by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a metric norm .",
    "we define an open ball centered at a point @xmath33 with radius @xmath34 by @xmath35 and its closure is denoted by @xmath36 .",
    "we define the class of continuous strictly increasing functions @xmath37 by @xmath38 and denote by @xmath39 all functions @xmath40 which satisfy @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , @xmath42 denotes all functions @xmath43 which satisfy @xmath44 as @xmath45.by @xmath46 we denote all functions @xmath47 such that @xmath48 for a fixed @xmath22 and and @xmath49 is decreasing and converging to zero for a fixed @xmath50.correspondingly , we also denote by @xmath51 all functions @xmath52 such that @xmath53 and @xmath54 is srictly increasing in both arguments .",
    "let @xmath55 be the set of initial conditions and let an open and bounded set @xmath56 be the set of unsafe states , where we assume that @xmath57 .",
    "for a given set @xmath56 , we denote the boundary of @xmath58 by @xmath59 and the closure of @xmath58 by @xmath60 .    following safety definition in @xcite , the ( autonomous ) system : with @xmath61 is called _ safe _ if for all @xmath62 and for all @xmath63 , @xmath64 . additionally , : with @xmath61 is called ( asymptotically ) stable with guaranteed safety if it is both ( asymptotically ) stable and safe . based on these notions ,",
    "the problem of stabilization with guaranteed safety has been investigated in @xcite where the control problem is to design a feedback law @xmath65 such that the closed loop system is safe and asymptotically stable , i.e. for all @xmath66 , we have that @xmath67 for all @xmath68 and @xmath69 . moreover , when @xmath70 the problem is called _ the global stabilization with guaranteed safety_.    as discussed briefly in the introduction , analyzing the robustness of systems stability in the presence of an ( external ) input signal can be done using the input - to - state stability ( iss ) framework @xcite .",
    "let us briefly recall the iss concept from @xcite .",
    "the system : is called _ input - to - state stable _ if there exist a @xmath71 and @xmath72 such that for any @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the following inequality holds for all @xmath68 : @xmath75 in this notion , the functions @xmath76 and @xmath77 in : describe the decaying effect from a non - zero initial condition @xmath78 and the influence of a bounded input signal @xmath13 to the state trajectory @xmath8 , respectively . the lyapunov characterization of iss systems is provided in the following well - known theorem from @xcite .",
    "[ thm1 ] the system : is iss if and only if there exists a smooth @xmath79 , functions @xmath80 and a function @xmath81 such that @xmath82 and @xmath83 hold for all @xmath84 and for all @xmath85 .    the notion of iss and",
    "its lyapunov characterization as above have been seminal in the study of nonlinear systems robustness with respect to the uncertainties in the initial conditions and to the external disturbance signals .",
    "for instance , a well - known nonlinear small - gain theorem in @xcite is based on the use of @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the study of convergence input convergence state property as in @xcite is based on the use of iss lyapunov function . however , as mentioned in the introduction , existing results on robustness have focused on the systems stability and there is not many attention on the robustness analysis on systems safety .",
    "let us recall few main results in literature on safety analysis . in order to verify the safety of system : with respect to a given unsafe set @xmath58 , a lyapunov - like function which is called barrier certificate has been introduced in @xcite where the safety of the system can be verified through the satisfaction of a lyapunov - like inequality without having to explicitly evaluate all possible systems trajectories .",
    "such barrier certificate is a reminiscent of chetaev function for analyzing instability of nonlinear systems .",
    "while the chetaev instability theorem is used to show that the trajectory of an autonomous system always escapes any compact set , the barrier certificate is mainly applied to show that a trajectory does not enter a given compact set .",
    "the barrier certificate theorem is summarized in following theorem .",
    "[ bcthm ] consider the ( autonomous ) system : with @xmath61 , i.e. , @xmath86 where @xmath87 , with a given unsafe set @xmath88 and set of initial conditions @xmath89 .",
    "assume that there exists a barrier certificate @xmath90",
    "satisfying @xmath91 then the system is safe .",
    "the proof of this theorem is based on the fact that the evolution of @xmath92 starting from a non - positive value ( c.f .",
    ":) will never cross the zero level set due to : , i.e. , the state trajectory will always be safe according to : .",
    "although the safety result as in theorem [ bcthm ] is formulated only for autonomous systems , an extension to the non - autonomous case has also been presented in @xcite . for the case where an external input @xmath13 is considered , e.g. , the complete system as in : , the safety condition : becomes @xmath93 where @xmath94 denotes the admissible set of input . however , the condition : is a very restrictive assumption since it must hold for all @xmath95 including the case when the initial condition @xmath96 is very close to @xmath6 .",
    "it means that when we start very close to the unsafe state , the system must always remain safe for whatever type of input signals @xmath13 as long as it has values in @xmath97 . in this case , we can say that such system is very robust with respect to bounded external input signals . in practice",
    ", we should expect a certain degree of fragility in the system , in the sense that , if we start very close to the unsafe state , a small external input signal can already jeopardize the systems safety ; a feature that is not captured in : .    instead of considering the inequality :",
    ", we will consider a more restrictive condition on @xmath92 for our main results later , where the non - increasing assumption of @xmath92 as in : is replaced by a strict inequality as follows @xmath98 where @xmath99 is a @xmath100 function .    in @xcite , the use of such barrier function @xmath92 for control design that guarantees safety has been presented .",
    "it is shown in these works that the standard lyapunov - based control design can directly be extended to solving the safety problem by replacing the lyapunov function with the barrier one .",
    "interested readers are referred to @xcite for control design methods that solve the stabilization with guaranteed safety by merging the control lyapunov function with the control barrier function .",
    "in this section , we will explore a new notion of input - to - state safety as a tool to analyze the robustness of systems safety .",
    "in particular , we focus our study on extending existing results on barrier certificate to the input - to - state safety framework ; akin to the role of lyapunov stability theory in the input - to - state stability results .",
    "[ isfdef ] the system : is called _ input - to - state safe _ ( issf ) locally in @xmath101 and with respect to the set of unsafe state @xmath102 if for all @xmath103 , there exist @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath11 such that @xmath106 holds for almost all @xmath107 and for all admissible , we mean that the tuple is such that the rhs of : is strictly positive for almost all @xmath22 . ] @xmath108 , where the constant @xmath11 can be dependent on boundary of @xmath109 .",
    "if a system is issf , we can infer from : that the system : may be brought to the unsafe state if the @xmath3-norm of @xmath13 is sufficiently large such that the rhs of : is negative .",
    "hence one can quantify the robustness of the system s safety with respect to an external input signal using this notion .",
    "for instance , if the initial condition @xmath78 is in the neighborhood of the boundary of unsafe state @xmath58 then : shows that a small external input signal @xmath13 may steer the state trajectory to enter @xmath6 ; even when the autonomous case is safe .",
    "since the first element on the rhs of : is a @xmath51 function , it implies that the distance between @xmath2 and @xmath6 is lower - bounded by a strictly increasing function until @xmath2 leaves @xmath109 .",
    "as this lower - bound of the distance is non - decreasing with time , : means that the system can eventually withstand larger input signal .",
    "we can also take a different view to the issf inequality above . if @xmath13 is considered to be a disturbance signal with known magnitude , e.g. , @xmath110 with @xmath111 , then : provides us with information on the admissible @xmath78 such that the rhs of : remains positive so that the system under such external disturbance will remain safe .",
    "let us now investigate the iss - lyapunov like condition for input - to - state safety of system : .",
    "[ issf_nl_pro ] consider system : with a given unsafe set @xmath112 .",
    "suppose that there exists an issf barrier function @xmath113 satisfying @xmath114 where @xmath115 , i=1, .. 4 . assume further that the system is iss .",
    "then the system is input - to - state safe locally in @xmath109 and w.r.t .",
    "in particular , for any @xmath116 and for all @xmath117 , the issf inequality : holds for all @xmath22 and for all admissible @xmath108 where @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 with @xmath122 be the solution of the following initial value problem @xmath123 so that @xmath124 for all @xmath50 .",
    "prior to proving this proposition , a few remarks can be made on the relation between the issf barrier function satisfying : - : and the barrier certificate satisfying : - : .",
    "first , it is easy to see that the condition : implies : where @xmath125 in : is @xmath126 .",
    "second , when we consider the autonomous case ( i.e. , @xmath61 ) , then : implies the strict version of : ( c.f . , :) .",
    "let us first evaluate the solution @xmath2 of : with @xmath127 . from : it follows that @xmath128 , thus evaluating the time derivative of @xmath129 gives us @xmath130 with @xmath131 which holds whenever @xmath132 .",
    "thus for almost all @xmath68 such that @xmath133 , inequality : implies that @xmath134 holds whenever @xmath132 . by letting @xmath135 ,",
    "the last inequality becomes @xmath136 note that function @xmath137 belongs to @xmath39 function and the function @xmath138 is positive definite .",
    "hence , the rhs of : is always positive .",
    "now by the comparison lemma , @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the solution @xmath141 of @xmath123 i.e. , @xmath124 for any positive initial condition @xmath142 .    by subtituting : into the lower bound and upper bound of @xmath143 in",
    ": it follows that @xmath144 which holds for almost all @xmath68 s.t . @xmath145 and whenever @xmath132 .",
    "now , let us consider the other case where @xmath146 . in this case",
    ", it follows immediately that @xmath147    we will now combine these two cases as follows .",
    "firstly , from : , it follows that @xmath148 where @xmath149 .",
    "this inequality is obtained by adding both sides of : by @xmath150 and substracting the right - hand side of : by @xmath151 which is non - positive for all @xmath4 . on the other hand , by multiplying both sides of : by @xmath152 and then by adding both sides by @xmath153 , we get @xmath154 thus , : ( which holds for @xmath155 ) and : ( which is true for @xmath146 ) imply that @xmath156 holds for all @xmath22 s.t . @xmath157 .",
    "since the state trajectory starts from the safe region , then for a given initial condition @xmath78 and bounded input @xmath13 , there exists sufficiently small @xmath158 @xmath159 and @xmath160 such that the right hand side of : and each term on the left - hand side are positive for all @xmath161 .",
    "thus , since @xmath162 for @xmath163 , : implies that @xmath164 holds for almost all @xmath161 .",
    "we will prove now that we can extend the time interval , where : is valid , to @xmath165 with finite @xmath166 if @xmath8 leaves the set @xmath109 at time @xmath167 , or @xmath168 when @xmath8 stays in @xmath169 at all time .",
    "in particular , we show that we can choose @xmath170 and @xmath159 such that both terms on the lhs of : are positive for almost all @xmath171 , so that : holds accordingly .",
    "firstly , let us show that for any @xmath172 , there exists @xmath173 such that latexmath:[\\[\\label{condition_1 }    since the system is iss , there exists @xmath71 and @xmath175 such that @xmath176 by triangular inequality and by denoting @xmath177 , it follows that @xmath178 where the last inequality is due to the fact that @xmath179 for all @xmath22 .",

    "hence , the second term on the lhs of : is always positive for all @xmath68 .",
    "it remains now to check whether @xmath181 for all @xmath171 .",
    "we will show this by contradiction .",

    "thus , we have that : holds for almost all @xmath171 .    finally , we will derive the conservative lower bound of : such that it will no longer depend on @xmath170 ( which is currently dependent on @xmath78 and @xmath13 as in :) . by the definition of @xmath170 in : , it is trivial to check that @xmath189 , @xmath190 thus , : implies that @xmath191 for almost all @xmath171 .    on the other hand , by defining @xmath192 , we have that when @xmath193 ( including for the second case when @xmath194 ) , latexmath:[\\[\\label{outsidex_eq }    once @xmath8 leaves @xmath109 and enters again @xmath109 at a later time interval , then we can use again the argument as before where the initial condition is taken in the neighborhood of the boundary of @xmath109 . indeed , suppose that @xmath8 enters again @xmath109 at time @xmath196 . then by following the same argument as before , we get @xmath197 for almost all @xmath198 where @xmath199 is the maximum time where @xmath8 remains in @xmath109 .    since in all of these cases , @xmath200 satisfies either : , : or : in different time intervals , we can combine them by taking the minimum of their lower bounds . thus by defining @xmath201 with @xmath202 as defined before : , @xmath203 holds for almost all @xmath107 .",
    "hence , we have issf with @xmath204 and @xmath205 where @xmath206 and @xmath207 are as in : and : , respectively , and @xmath208 as defined above .",
    "note that the choice of @xmath209 is , in this case , independent of admissible tuple @xmath108 .",
    "the iss assumption in this proposition can be relaxed by weaker conditions that can guarantee the boundedness of @xmath200 so that the inequality : in the proof of proposition [ issf_nl_pro ] holds .",
