    "these observations demonstrated ( see the _",
    "swift_/xrt lightcurve in fig .",
    "[ fig : igr11215 ] ) that short duration and bright flares are actually part of a longer accretion phase at a lower level , lasting days , not only hours .",
    "the main mechanisms proposed to explain the transient outbursts in sfxts are based on the structure of the supergiant wind , and can be divided into models based on ( 1)-spherically symmetric clumpy winds , ( 2)-anisotropic winds , and those which deal with ( 3)-gated mechanisms able to stop the accretion depending on the properties of both the companion wind and of the compact object ( neutron star magnetic field and spin period ) .",
    "one of the first hypotheses proposed to explain the transient x  ray emission from these sources was the _",
    "clumpy wind model _",
    ", where the short flares in sfxts were supposed to be produced by the sporadic accretion of massive clumps which compose the blue supergiant companion wind ( int zand 2005 ) .",
    "indeed , in the last years more attention has been paid to a clumpy wind structure in early type stars ( see , e.g. , lepine & moffat 2008 ; oskinova et al . 2007 and references therein )    in the framework of the wind accretion ( bondi & hoyle 1944 ) which should be at work in this new class of hmxbs , the x  ray luminosity depends on the wind mass loss rate , @xmath7 , and on the relative velocity , @xmath8 , of the neutron star and the wind , and is proportional to @xmath7@xmath8@xmath9 ( waters et al . 1989 ) .",
    "this implies that large density and/or velocity wind contrasts produce large variability in the accretion x  ray luminosity , and thus can result in a very large dynamic range .",
    "walter & zurita heras ( 2007 ) explain integral observations of the bright flares from sfxts as due to the interaction of the compact object orbiting at @xmath010 stellar radii from the supergiant companion , accreting wind clumps with a mass of 10@xmath1010@xmath11  g , and with a density ratio between the clumps and the inter - clump medium of 10010,000 .",
    "recently , negueruela et al . (",
    "2008 ) proposed a revised version of this hypothesis , based on the clumpy wind model by oskinova et al .",
    "these authors proposed two possible configurations for the sfxts : ( a)- a circular orbit just outside the region where the supergiant wind is denser ( within about 2 stellar radii ) or ( b)- a wide eccentric orbit , which allows longer quiescent intervals . in both the proposed geometries , since the neutron star orbits outside the region of the wind where the number density of the clumps is higher",
    ", the probability to accrete a clump is very low .    in this framework",
    ", the difference between sfxts and persistent supergiant hmxbs mainly depends on the orbital separation , which is within 2 stellar radii for persistent sources , where the neutron star orbits inside the dense region of the wind , and much more than 2 stellar radii for sfxts , because of a much lower probability to accrete a single clump .      a second type of explanation involves _ anisotropic winds _",
    ", instead of spherically symmetric winds ( as assumed in the _ clumpy wind model _ ) , and has been proposed to explain the periodic outbursts observed from the sfxt igr  j112155952 ( sidoli et al .",

    "swift_/xrt around the expected time of the new outburst , on 2007 february 9 ( romano et al .",
    "2007a ) , after 329 days from the previously observed outburst ( fig .",
    "[ fig : igr11215 ] ) .",
    "the first periodicity discovered in the outburst recurrence from this source was indeed 329 days ( sidoli et al .",
    "2006 ; smith et al . 2006 ) . for the first time a complete outburst from a sfxt was observed from quasi - quiescence , up to the peak ( lasting less than a day , with several bright and short flares and a high intensity variability ) , and then back to almost quiescence in a few days .",
    "the main important result of this campaign is that the outburst duration is much longer than a few hours , as was thought before on the basis of integral or rxte observations .",
    "the hour duration flares seen by these intruments are indeed part of a much longer accretion phase , lasting a few days .",
    "the periodic recurrence of the outburst suggests in a natural way the interpretation of the recurrence timescale as the orbital period of the binary system , with the outbursts triggered at , or near , the periastron passage .",
    "moreover , the shape of the x  ray lightcurve from the entire outburst can be hardly explained with bondi - hoyle accretion ( bondi & hoyle , 1944 ) from a spherically symmetric wind in a binary system with an orbital period of 329 days ( sidoli et al . , 2007 ) : the observed x ",
    "ray lightcurve is too narrow and steep compared with the expected smoothly variable x ",
    "ray luminosity produced by accretion onto the surface of an approaching neutron star along an eccentric orbit ( even assuming very high eccentricities ) .",
    "we interpreted these observations as a clear evidence of the fact that the clumpy supergiant wind is not spherically symmetric .",
    "the short outburst can be explained with accretion from another wind component , for example an equatorially enhanced wind component ( or any other preferential plane for the outflowing wind ) , denser and slower than the symmetric polar wind from the blue supergiant , inclined with respect to the orbital plane of the system , to explain the shortness of the outburst and the shape of the source lightcurve .",
    "this geometry can also easily explain the periodic occurrence of the outbursts .",
    "based on the 329 days periodicity , we planned a second monitoring campaign with _ swift _ during the expected apastron passage ( around 165 days after the last outburst ) .",
    "this new campaign led to the observation of a new unexpected outburst from this source after a half of the previous period , suggesting that @xmath0165 days is probably the new orbital period ( sidoli et al .",
    "these new observations could be explained by two different geometries for the sfxt igr  j112155952 , depending on the correct orbital period , p@xmath12 : ( a)- if p@xmath12 @xmath0 165 days , the orbit should be eccentric to produce only one outburst per orbit , when the neutron star crosses the equatorial wind ; ( b)- if p@xmath12 @xmath0 329 days , then the outbursts are two per orbit and the orbit should be circular , since the two consecutive outbursts reach similar peak luminosities ( sidoli et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "+    this interpretation could explain also the other sfxts outbursts , although the geometry of this equatorially enhanced wind component could be different from that explaining igr  j112155952 : for example , the equatorial wind could intersect the orbit of the compact object not near the periastron , but at different phases , thus producing two regions on the orbit with enhanced wind density ( where the outbursts are triggered ) , and thus two different periodicities , p@xmath13 and p@xmath14 , in the outburst occurrence , if the orbit is eccentric , such that p@xmath13 + p@xmath14=p@xmath12 .",
    "igr  j112155952 could be probably the only system where the intersection of the equatorial outflow with the neutron star orbit happens at ( or very near to ) the periastron .",
    "this could explain why it is more difficult to discover a periodicity or ( a double periodicity ) in the outburst recurrence in the other sfxts .",
    "moreover , the thickness of this wind component could be different , and the inclination with respect to the orbital plane could vary a lot among sfxts , thus producing very different phenomenologies , for example in the outburst duration and recurrence , and covering a different and variable fraction of the neutron star orbit .",
    "there are indications that preferential planes in the outflowing supergiant winds are probably present , especially from x  ray observations of other types of hmxbs .",
    "in particular , apastron outbursts have been observed in supergiant hmxbs with known orbital periods ( e.g. pravdo & ghosh 2001 ; corbet et al .",
    "2007 ) where the presence of equatorially enhanced winds inclined with respect to the neutron star orbit have been suggested in order to properly explain the observational x  ray data .    in conclusion ,",
    "the observational evidence at the basis of our suggestion for the presence of a preferential plane for the outflowing wind in blue supergiant is provided by the periodicity in the igr  j112155952 outburst recurrence and by the shape of the x  ray lightcurve , which can not be produced by any temporary or transient feature in the stellar wind ( such as wind streams or gas shells or shocks , or macro - structures of clumps ) , but must be due to some permanent and orbital phase - fixed structure in the supergiant wind .",
    "this is naturally provided by a second wind component crossing the neutron star orbit .",
    "we note that periodicities in the outburst recurrence begin to be found also in other sfxts : igr  j184830311 displays a recurrence periodicity of @xmath018.5 days ( sguera et al . , 2007b ) ; this source was at first classified as a be x  ray transient , but very recently rahoui & chaty ( 2008 ) optically identified the companion as a blue supergiant , thus the source is actually a sfxt ; igr  j084084503 displays an x  ray activity ( multiple flare duration and x  ray outburst recurrence ) which is compatible with an orbital period of 35 days ( see romano et al .",
    "2009 for details ) .",
    "other possibilities which have been suggested to explain the sfxts outbursts , and especially their high dynamic ranges , are based on gated mechanisms where the accretion is halted because of the presence of a magnetic or a centrifugal barrier , which depends on the properties of the compact object ( the neutron star ) , in particular its spin period and its surface magnetic field .",
    "bozzo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) applied this idea to sfxts hosting a highly magnetized neutron star [ see also grebenev & sunyaev ( 2007 ) and references therein ; goetz et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ] .",
    "wind accretion in a hmxb containing a magnetized neutron star depends on three different radii : accretion radius [ r@xmath15 ; bondi & hoyle ( 1944 ) ] , corotation radius ( r@xmath16 ) and magnetospheric radius ( r@xmath17 ) . while the corotation radius depends only on the neutron star mass and its spin period , the other two radii ( r@xmath15 and r@xmath17 ) depend on the properties of the supergiant wind , while r@xmath17 also depend on the neutron star magnetic field , b ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ; stella et al . 1986 and references therein ) .",
    "different types of interactions ( accretion or inhibition of the accretion ) between the companion wind and the magnetized neutron star are possible depending on the relative positions of these three radii which , on the other hand , are related to the neutron star magnetic field and spin period , and to the properties of the supergiant wind ( its velocity and density ) .",
    "direct accretion is possible only if r@xmath15@xmath18r@xmath17 and r@xmath16@xmath18r@xmath17 . in all the other cases ,",
    "the accretion is prevented , by a magnetic barrier or by a centrifugal barrier .",
    "large luminosity swings ( @xmath010,000 or more ) can result from transitions across these different regimes , which are produced if the relative positions of the three radii r@xmath15 , r@xmath16 , r@xmath17 change with time , depending on a change in the wind parameters . thus , modest variations in the wind properties ( as , for example , in a clumpy wind environment ) can modify r@xmath15 and r@xmath17 in such a way to produce an outburst .",
    "this only applies if the three radii driving the accretion display very similar values .",
    "bozzo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) show that an abrupt x  ray luminosity jump from the quiescence ( at about 10@xmath1  erg  s@xmath2 ) to the peak of an outburst in a sfxt ( 10@xmath310@xmath4  erg  s@xmath2 ) can be explained only if the the neutron star spins slowly ( @xmath01000  s or larger ) and if it displays a magnetar - like magnetic field ( b@xmath010@xmath19  g ) , in presence of a relatively mild change in the wind density ( one or two orders of magnitude , instead of the at least 4 orders of magnitude requested by the clumpy wind model discussed above ) .",
    "note that this model requires in any case a variability ( although mild ) in the wind parameters ( such as clumps , or any other structure in the wind with higher density than the smooth wind ) .",

    "the low - level flaring activity we observe in sfxts during the out - of - outburst emission can be explained both in the anisotropic wind hypothesis , where it is easily accounted for by the accretion from the faster and less dense polar wind component from the supergiant star , and in the spherically symmetric clumpy wind , for example assuming a distribution of clump sizes or masses ( although the mass spectrum of the wind clumps is unknown ) . in any case , the flares from sfxts can not be explained by the accretion of a single clump , since the duration of the outburst is much longer than only a few hours , but extends for several days .",
    "a spherically symmetric wind ( although clumpy ) can not explain the periodicity of the outburst recurrence in igr  j112155952 .",
    "based on the anisotropic wind hypothesis , the outbursts should occur at preferential orbital phases , and display some sort of periodicity ( or double periodicity or quasi - periodicity ) in the outburst recurrence .",
    "although several observations have already been performed , not only with _ swift _ but also with integral , we emphasize the fact that , if all the other sfxts are indeed similar to igr  j112155952 ( which displays periodic outbursts every @xmath0165  days ) , the likely periodicity ( or double periodicity ) in the outburst recurrence should be of order of months .",
    "this implies that probably they have not been discovered yet because of a lack of observations .",
