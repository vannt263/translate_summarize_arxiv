    "between about 1.5 and 10 m@xmath0 , at spectral types a and b , about 5 % of main sequence ( ms ) stars have magnetic fields with characteristic strengths of about 1 kg . such stars also show important chemical peculiarities and are thus usually called the magnetic chemically peculiar ap / bp stars . the strength of the magnetic fields of these stars can not be explained by an envelope dynamo as in the sun . until now , the most reliable hypothesis has been to assume a fossil origin for these magnetic fields .",
    "this hypothesis implies that the stellar magnetic fields are relics from the field present in the parental interstellar cloud .",
    "its also implies that magnetic fields can ( at least partially ) survive the violent phenomena accompanying the birth of stars , and can also remain throughout their evolution and until at least the end of the ms , without regeneration .    according to the fossil field model",
    ", we should observe magnetic fields in some pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars of intermediate mass , the so - called herbig ae / be stars .",
    "however no magnetic field was observed up to recently in these stars ( except hd  104237 , * ? ? ?",
    "can we obtain some observational evidence of the presence of magnetic fields during the pms phase of evolution , as predicted by the fossil field hypothesis ?",
    "if some herbig ae / be stars are discovered to have magnetic fields , is the fraction of magnetic to non - magnetic herbig stars the same as the fraction for main sequence stars ? is the magnetic field in herbig stars strong enough to explain the strength of that of ap / bp stars ?",
    "chemical peculiarities and magnetism are not the only characteristic properties observed in the ap / bp stars .",
    "most magnetic ms stars have rotation periods ( typically of a few days ) that are several times longer than the rotation periods of non - magnetic ms stars ( a few hours to one day ) .",
    "it is usually believed that magnetic braking , in particular during pms evolution , when the star can exchange angular momentum with its massive accretion disk , is responsible for this low rotation @xcite .",
    "an alternative involves a rapid dissipation of the magnetic field during the early stages of pms evolution for the fastest rotators , due to strong turbulence induced by rotational shear developed under the surface of the stars , as the convection do in the solar - type stars ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this scenario , only slow rotators could retain their initial magnetic fields , and evolve as magnetic stars to the main sequence .",
    "so the question to be addressed is the following : does the magnetic field control the rotation of the star , or else does the rotation of the star control the magnetic field ?",
    "we propose that this question can be answered by studying rotation and magnetic fields in herbig ae / be stars .",
    "the herbig ae / be stars are intermediate - mass pre - main sequence stars , and therefore the evolutionary progenitors of the ms a and b stars .",
    "they are distinguished from the classical be stars by their ir emission and the association with nebulae , characteristics which are due to their young age .",
    "they display many observational phenomena often associated with magnetic activity .",
    "first , high ionised lines are observed in the spectra of some stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and x - ray emission have been detected , coming from some herbig stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in active cool stars , many of these phenomena are produced in hot chromospheres or coronae .",
    "some authors mentioned rotational modulation of resonance lines which they speculate may be due to rotation modulation of winds structured by magnetic field @xcite .    in the literature",
    "we find many clues of the presence of circumstellar disks around these stars , from spectroscopic data showing strong emission , and also from photometric data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , using coronagraphic data and interferometric data , some authors have also found direct evidence of circumstellar disks around these stars @xcite .",
    "a careful study of these disks shows that they have similar properties to the disk of their low mass counterpart @xcite , the t tauri stars , whose the emission lines are explained by magnetospheric accretion models @xcite .",
    "finally @xcite have sucessfully applied their magnetospheric accretion model to herbig stars to explain the emission lines in their spectra .",
    "for all these reasons we suspect that the herbig stars may host large - scale magnetic fields that should be detectable with current instrumentation . however , many authors tried to detect such fields without much success @xcite . but",
    "in 2005 , a new high - resolution spectropolarimeter , espadons , has been installed at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "we therefore decided to proceed to survey many herbig stars in order to investigate rotation and magnetism in the pre - main sequence stars of intermediate mass .",
    "we have selected herbig stars in the catalogues from @xcite and @xcite with a visual magnitude brighter than 12 .",
    "our sample contain 55 stars which have masses ranging from 1.5 m@xmath0 to 15 m@xmath0 with all ages between the birthline and the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] are plotted the stars of our sample in an hr diagram , as well as the evolutionary tracks computed with the cesam code @xcite , and the birthlines computed by @xcite with two mass accretion rates during the protostellar phase : 10@xmath1  m@xmath0.yr@xmath2 and 10@xmath3  m@xmath0.yr@xmath2 .     and",

    "2007 , in preparation ) during many scientific runs .",
    "we used this instrument in polarimetric mode , generating spectra of 65000 resolution .",
    "each exposure was divided in 4 sub - exposures of equal time in order to compute the optimal extraction of the polarisation spectra ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , donati et al",
    ". 2007 , in prep . ) .",
    "we recorded only circular polarisation , as the zeeman signature expected in linear polarisation is about one order of magnitude lower than circular polarisation .",
    "the data were reduced using the `` libre esprit '' package especially developed for espadons , and installed at the cfht ( donati et al .",
    "1997 , donati et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) . after reduction",
    ", we obtained the intensity stokes @xmath5 and the circular polarisation stokes @xmath6 spectra of the stars observed .",
    "we then applied the least squares deconvolution procedure to all spectra @xcite , in order to increase our signal to noise ratio .",
    "this method assumes that all lines of the intensity spectrum have a profile of similar shape .",
    "hence , this supposes that all lines are broadened in the same way .",
    "we can therefore consider that the observed spectrum is a convolution between a profile ( which is the same for all lines ) and a mask including all lines of the spectrum .",
    "we therefore apply a deconvolution to the observed spectrum using the pre - computed mask , in order to obtain the average photospheric profiles of stokes @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in this procedure",
    ", each line is weighted by its signal to noise ratio , its depth in the unbroadened model and its land factor . for each star we used a mask computed using `` extract stellar '' line lists obtained from the vienna atomic line database ( vald)vald/ ] , with effective temperatures and @xmath7 suitable for each star ( wade , alecian et al .",
    "2007 , in prep . ) .",
    "we excluded from this mask hydrogen balmer lines , strong resonance lines , lines whose land factor is unknown and emission lines .",

    "note the amplification factor in @xmath6.,width=257 ]    thanks to the high performance of the instrument espadons and to the lsd method , * we have discovered four new magnetic herbig ae / be stars * @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : compil ] is plotted the stokes @xmath5 and @xmath6 profiles of each new discovered magnetic herbig ae / be star : hd  200775 , hd  72106 , v380  ori and hd  190073 , and of four stars in which a magnetic field has not been detected ( the undetected stars , hereafter ) .",
    "contrary to the undetected stars , the stokes @xmath6 profiles of the magnetic stars are not null and display a strong zeeman signature , of the same width of the photospheric @xmath5 profile , characteristic of the presence of a magnetic field in the stars .",
    "these 4 detections among our sample of 55 stars lead to the conclusion that * 7% of herbig ae / be stars are magnetic*. the projection of the distribution of magnetic and non - magnetic main sequence a and b stars on the pre - main sequence phase , assuming a fossil field hypothesis , predict that between 5 and 10 % of herbig stars should be magnetic , which is consistent with our observations . we therefore bring a new strong argument in favoured of the fossil field hypothesis ( wade , alecian et al . 2007 , in prep . ) .        we determined the topology and the intensity of the magnetic fields of the four magnetic herbig stars in order to compare them to the magnetic ms a and b stars . with this aim",
    ", we used the oblique rotator model described by @xcite .",
    "we consider a dipole placed at a distance @xmath8 on the magnetic axis of a spherical rotating star with a magnetic intensity at the pole @xmath9 .",

    "( 2007 ) , in prep . , 4 : @xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     according to @xcite , in the weak field approximation , the stokes @xmath6 profile is proportional to the magnetic field projected onto the line of sight and integrated over the surface of the star ( @xmath12 , the longitudinal magnetic field , hereafter ) . as the star rotates , the visible magnetic changes , resulting in variation of @xmath13 .",
    "therefore the stokes @xmath6 profile changes with the rotation phase .    in order to determine the geometrical and magnetic parameters",
    "@xmath11 , @xmath9 and @xmath8 , as well as the rotation period @xmath14 of the star , we observed the stars at different rotation phases and fit simultaneously all the stokes @xmath6 profiles observed for each star . with this aim we calculated a grid of @xmath6 profiles , using the oblique rotator model , for each date of observations , varying the five parameters .",
    "then , for each star , we applied a @xmath15 minimisation to find the best model which matches simultaneously all the @xmath6 profiles observed .",
    "[ fig : fitallv ] shows the result of our fitting procedure for one star : hd 200775 .",

    "the values of the geometrical and magnetic parameters are summarized in table [ tab : fp ] for each stars . in the case of hd 190073 ,",
    "the topology and the intensity of its magnetic field are not constrained , because , during 2 years observations , the stokes @xmath6 profile has not been observed to vary .",
    "there are 3 possible explanations for this : the inclination @xmath10 is very small , the obliquity angle @xmath11 is very small , or the rotation period of the star is very long .",
    "more observations will allow us to discard two of these solutions .",
    "however the stability of the magnetic field over more than 2 years and the shape of the stokes @xmath6 profiles lead us to the conclusion that this star hosts a large - scale fossil magnetic field @xcite .",

    ", we can estimate the magnetic intensity at their surface they will have when they will reach the zams ( see table [ tab : fp ] ) .",
    "we found intensities ranging from 300  g to 3.6 kg , which is very close to what is observed in the ap / bp stars .",
    "hence we bring 2 more new strong arguments in favour of the fossil field hypothesis .      in the case of the other 51 stars",
    "no magnetic field was detected .",
    "however , a non - detection does not mean that the star does not host a magnetic field .",
    "the star may host a magnetic field which is too weak to be detected with our method , or we way observed it at a rotation phase where the stokes @xmath6 profile was too weak to be detected .",
    "however , for two of these stars ( hd 139614 , hd 169142 ) , with @xmath16 similar to the magnetic herbig stars , we obtained data during many successive nights , with a 3@xmath17 uncertainty on the measured @xmath12 less than 50  g , which is typical of the uncertainties on @xmath12 obtained in the magnetic herbig stars . therefore ,",
    "if these stars would host a magnetic field similar to the magnetic herbig stars , we would have detect it .",
    "this implies that if these stars host a magnetic field , their magnetic intensities are much lower than those of the magnetic herbig stars .",
    "we will consider only these two well - constrained stars in the following , because more work need to be done to give conclusions on the magnetic intensity of the other stars .",
    "we can use these intensities to test if magnetospheric accretion can occur in these stars . following @xcite we used the models of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , which consider a dipole magnetic field aligned with the rotation axis , and coupled with the star until the corotation radius or a fraction of the corotation radius .",
    "the matter from the disk is therefore funnelled along the magnetic lines until the surface of the star .",
    "we used the equations , given by these authors , of the polar magnetic field in function of the parameters of the stars to calculate the minimum intensity required to trigger magnetospheric accretion in these stars ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we considered a mass accretion rate of 10@xmath18  @xmath4.yr@xmath2 , which is the typical value in herbig stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )    in the case of the magnetic stars we found for the models of @xcite and @xcite , that only one stars on four have a strong enough magnetic intensity to cause magnetospheric accretion , whereas with the model of @xcite , the four stars can have magnetospheric accretion .    in the case of the",
    "two well constrained undetected stars , considering that they could host a magnetic field with intensity lower than few 100 g , the minimum field intensity required is too high to have magnetospheric accretion .",
    "therefore , according to the models that we considered , and taking into account our observations , magnetospheric accretion can not occur in all herbig stars .",
    "we used the new spectropolarimeter espadons installed at the cfht to proceed in a survey of the herbig stars , in order to investigate their rotation and magnetic field .",
    "we discovered four magnetic stars whose field topology is similar to the ms magnetic a - b stars .",
    "we also show that the magnetic intensities of these fields and the proportion of magnetic herbig stars can explain the magnetic intensity and the proportion of magnetic fields among the ms stars , in the context of fossil field model .",
    "we therefore bring fundamental arguments in favour of this hypothesis .",
    "the four magnetic herbig stars are slow rotators ( @xmath19 km.s@xmath2 ) which supports that magnetic herbig ae / be stars are the progenitors of the magnetic ap / bp stars . among these magnetic stars",
    "two have very low @xmath16 ( @xmath20 km.s@xmath2 ) and are very young ( age@xmath21 myr ) . assuming these stars are true slow rotators , this implies that there exists a braking mechanism which acts very early during the pms evolution of the intermediate mass stars",
    ". we could think that this braking mechanism has a magnetic origin , although among the undetected stars we also observe same stars with small @xmath16 ( @xmath22 km.s@xmath2 ) .",
    "the nature of the braking mechanism requires addition study .",
    "finally it has been proposed that all herbig stars should undergo magnetospheric accretion , as the spectra of all stars show similar emission .",
    "however , we calculated the minimum polar magnetic intensity of the magnetic herbig stars and of two well - constrained undetected stars to get magnetospheric accretion , using three different models which have been developed for the t tauri stars @xcite",
    ". considering the intensity of the magnetic stars , as well as the maximum magnetic intensity of the two well - constrained undetected stars , if they host a magnetic field , our first conclusion is that magnetospheric accretion can not occur in all the herbig stars ( a statistic study taking into account all the undetected stars is in progress in order to confirm this result ) .",
    "therefore , either the models that we used are not well adapted to the herbig stars , or the emission lines are not only produced by magnetospheric accretion .",
    "a thorough observational and theoretical study of the emission in the spectra , as well as the surroundings of the herbig ae / be stars is necessary to better understand the interaction of these stars with their surroundings ."
