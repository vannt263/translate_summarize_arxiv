    "national metrology institutes reproduce the unit of resistance , the ohm , by means of quantum hall effect ( qhe ) devices .",
    "present experiments ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) are based on multiterminal ( typically 8 terminals ) semiconductor devices where a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) is created . at low temperature , and under appropriate values of magnetic flux density @xmath0 ,",
    "the 2deg resistance is quantised : @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the von klitzing constant and @xmath3 is the plateau index .",
    "the accurate measurement of @xmath4 has to reject any stray resistance ( in dc ) or impedance ( in ac ) which is added by the device contacts and the external wiring .",
    "even though a simple four - terminal connection can be sufficient for dc measurements on a single device , the series or parallel connection of several devices  @xcite , the realization of single - chip quantum hall arrays  @xcite and measurements in the ac regime  @xcite ask for more complex connection schemes , usually based on the _ double- _ or _",
    "triple - series _ connections introduced by delahaye  @xcite .    in single device double- and triple - series connections ,",
    "only adjacent terminals are short - circuited together , and this yields a resistance value of @xmath4 . however ,",
    "when non - adjacent terminals are short - circuited together , the resulting resistance value can be a multiple or a fraction of @xmath4 .",
    "fang  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( a ) ) experimentally investigated several connections achieving resistances values of @xmath5 with the same 6-terminal device at a single plateau .",
    "dc analytical modelling of double- and triple - series connections of single and twin devices was performed in  @xcite and  @xcite ; in  @xcite the analysis was extended to the ac regime .",
    "the modelling process is based on the ricketts - kemeny model  @xcite of the quantum hall device , or on its derived ones  @xcite .",
    "the above analyses were carried out by applying kirchhoff s laws to the chosen model with constraints given by the external connections .",
    "then , the resulting equations were solved to determine a particular four - terminal resistance ( or impedance ) .",
    "such analytical calculations can be tedious and error - prone , and numerical simulations can have problems of convergence  @xcite .",
    "therefore , only a few connection schemes of known practical relevance have been analysed in full .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a general approach for modelling the electrical behaviour of multiterminal qhe devices with external connections .",
    "this method is based on the use of the so - called indefinite admittance matrix .",
    "four - terminal resistances can then be determined from matrix equations depending on two matrices : one that represents the unconnected device ( or devices ) ; another that represents the external connections and that can be easily written by inspection .",
    "consider the @xmath6-terminal element @xmath7 of figure  [ fig : device_representation ] and let the terminal voltages @xmath8 be measured with respect to an arbitrary reference point @xmath9 ( datum node ) .",
    "we make the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "@xmath7 is linear and time - invariant .",
    "whenever @xmath7 is connected to an external network , the complete circuit is uniquely solvable .",
    "the sum of the terminal currents @xmath10 is identically zero , i.e.  @xmath11 .",
    "the terminal currents are invariant under a change of the reference point , i.e.  under the transformation @xmath12 .    by means of assumptions",
    "* a1 * and * a2 * , when @xmath7 is connected to an external network , we can write the relations between its terminal currents and voltages as @xmath13 where the admittance coefficients @xmath14 are complex quantities defined by the equation @xmath15 the set of equations   can be put in matrix form as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the column vectors @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( t denotes the transpose operation ) , and @xmath21 is the matrix @xmath22 .",
    "this matrix , which has been called by shekel  @xcite the _ indefinite admittance matrix _ , has the following properties  @xcite :    1 .",
    "the sum of the elements of each column is identically zero , i.e.  @xmath23 for any @xmath24 .",
    "this property is a direct consequence of assumption * a3*. 2 .",
    "the sum of the elements of each row is identically zero , i.e.  @xmath25 for any @xmath26 .",
    "this property is a direct consequence of assumption * a4*. indeed , these first two properties imply that @xmath21 is a singular matrix .",
    "if its @xmath27th terminal is grounded , @xmath7 can be regarded as an @xmath28-port with port voltages @xmath29 . in this case , the non - singular @xmath30 _ short - circuit admittance matrix _",
    "@xmath31 of the @xmath28-port can be obtained from @xmath21 by deleting the @xmath27th row and column . moreover , since @xmath32 is non - singular , it can be used to determine the @xmath30 _ open - circuit impedance matrix _",
    "@xmath33 of the @xmath28-port  @xcite .    in the application of qhe devices to resistance and impedance metrology , one",
    "is usually concerned with the determination of four - terminal transfer resistances and impedances . with reference to figure  [ fig : impedances ] , we define the four - terminal impedance @xmath34 as the ratio of the open - circuit voltage @xmath35 to the current @xmath36 flowing into terminal @xmath26 and out of terminal @xmath24 , when all other terminals are open - circuited : @xmath37 throughout this work , impedances of the form @xmath38 ,",
    "i.e. with one terminal in common , are referred to as three - terminal impedances , and that of the form @xmath39 , i.e. with two terminals in common , are referred to as two - terminal impedances .",
    "one way of determining @xmath34 from @xmath21 makes use of property  * p3 * above and is based on the fact that one can `` transform '' the @xmath6-terminal @xmath7 into an @xmath28-port by grounding one terminal , as shown in figure  [ fig : impedances_grounded ] for the @xmath27th terminal . in this case , the terminal pairs @xmath40 and @xmath41 can be considered as input ports , respectively driven by the currents @xmath36 and @xmath42 , while the terminal pairs @xmath43 and @xmath44 can be considered as output ports with port voltages @xmath45 and @xmath46 , so that the ratio @xmath47 can be easily determined from the open - circuit impedance matrix @xmath48 obtained from the application of property  * p3*. this method is described in detail in section  [ sec : ideal_device_connections ] by means of examples .",
    "a more straightforward , albeit more cumbersome , method of determining @xmath34 from @xmath21 is described in  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : device_model_ideal ] shows the portion between terminals @xmath49 and @xmath50 of the ring - array dc equivalent circuit of an _ ideal _ @xmath6-terminal qhe device , as proposed by delahaye  @xcite . the magnetic flux density @xmath0 points out of the page : reversing @xmath0 , reverses the sign of the current - controlled voltage sources .",
    "applying kirchhoff s voltage law ( kvl ) to nodes @xmath49 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath50 yields @xmath53 where @xmath54 and it is assumed that @xmath55 .",
    "the above set of equations directly determines the indefinite admittance matrix @xmath56 of the ideal qhe device : @xmath57 which is an @xmath58 circulant matrix .",
    "as was pointed out by fang  @xcite and delahaye  @xcite , multiterminal qhe devices can be connected in different ways to obtain multiples and fractions of the quantised hall resistance . in this section ,",
    "we describe how to analyse single - device connections by means of the indefinite admittance matrix .",
    "+    ( a )    ( b )    ( c )    consider the simple example of figure  [ fig : single_device_1](a ) , where a 6-terminal device is employed in a typical double - series connection with terminals 1,6 and 3,4 short - circuited .",
    "suppose that the two - terminal impedance @xmath59 is to be determined : this means , as shown in figure  [ fig : single_device_1](b ) , that one has to inject a current @xmath60 between terminals 1 and 4 and to measure the voltage @xmath61 to obtain @xmath62 .",
    "now , in order to determine @xmath59 , proceed as follow ( see  @xcite for details ) .    1 .",
    "ground one terminal . in the above example , for simplicity , we have chosen to ground terminal 4 , as shown in figure  [ fig : single_device_1](c ) .",
    "2 .   choose a set @xmath63 of independent port voltages ( @xmath64 in figure  [ fig : single_device_1](c ) ) .",
    "in general , since short - circuiting terminals constraints the terminal voltages , it is @xmath65 .",
    "3 .   write down the relations between the terminal voltages and the port voltages : since these relations are linear , they can be written in matrix form as @xmath66 where , in general , @xmath67 is an @xmath68 matrix and @xmath69 . for the circuit of figure  [ fig : single_device_1](c ) , @xmath70 and therefore @xmath71 the corresponding port current vector @xmath72",
    "is related to the terminal current vector @xmath17 by the equation @xmath73 so that the power flowing into the device is invariant , i.e.  @xmath74 .",
    "4 .   determine the @xmath75 admittance matrix @xmath76 which relates the port current vector to the port voltage vector , @xmath77 .",
    "since at least one terminal is grounded , by virtue of * p3 * , @xmath32 is a non - singular short - circuit admittance matrix whose inverse is the open - circuit impedance matrix @xmath78 . for the circuit of figure  [ fig : single_device_1](c ) , with @xmath79 , one obtains @xmath80 and @xmath81 5 .",
    "identify the input and the output ports . in the example of figure  [ fig : single_device_1](c )",
    ", there are only one input port and one output port , and both coincide with port 1 .",
    "thus , @xmath82    a second , more significant , example is shown in figure  [ fig : single_device_2](a ) .",
    "this is one of the connections experimentally analysed by fang and stiles  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( a ) ) . in this case",
    ", suppose that the two - terminal impedance @xmath59 and the four - terminal impedance @xmath83 are to be determined .",
    "in particular , for @xmath59 , fang and stiles measured the value @xmath84 ( within few parts in @xmath85 ) .",
    "+    ( a )    ( b )    in figure  [ fig : single_device_2](b ) , following the method described above , we have grounded one of the terminals ( terminal 4 , again , to have one input port only ) and we have defined @xmath64 as port voltages .",
    "thus @xmath86 and @xmath87    the short - circuit admittance matrix and the open - circuit impedance matrix are respectively @xmath88 and @xmath89 then , to determine @xmath59 : i ) inject a current between terminals 1 and 4 , i.e.  _ in _ port 1 , which is considered as an input port ; and ii ) determine the voltage across terminals 3 and 4 , i.e.  _ across _ port 1 , which is also considered as an output port . hence @xmath90 which is in agreement with the value given in  @xcite . moreover , to determine @xmath83 : i ) inject a current between terminals 1 and 4 , i.e.  _ in _ port 1 , which is considered as an input port ; and ii ) determine the voltage across terminals 2 and 3 , i.e.  _ across _ port 2 and 3 , which are considered as output ports . hence @xmath91",
    "in the equivalent circuit of figure  [ fig : device_model_nonideal ] , a contact resistance @xmath92 has been added in series to each terminal . applying kvl to nodes @xmath49 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and",
    "@xmath50 yields @xmath93 in matrix form , the above set of equations can be written as @xmath94 or @xmath95 where @xmath56 is given by   and @xmath96 because of  , the indefinite admittance matrix for the circuit of figure  [ fig : device_model_nonideal ] is @xmath97    actually , in analytical calculations , @xmath98 need not to be evaluated in full .",
    "in fact , since @xmath99 is typically very close to the identity matrix ( cf .",
    "equation  ) , a taylor series expansion of @xmath98 up to the appropriate order in @xmath100 might be sufficient in most cases .",
    "in this section we analyse the effect of contact resistances on several examples of single device connections ( table  [ tab : single_device_connections ] , first column ) .",
    "these examples , which were already analysed using other methods by delahaye  @xcite and by jeffery _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , have been chosen for their practical interest .",
    "for each connection , the second column of table  [ tab : single_device_connections ] shows a suitable choice of port voltages and the third column shows the corresponding matrix @xmath67 .",
    "taking into account equations   and  , for each connection we have determined the short - circuit admittance matrix @xmath101 and the open - circuit impedance matrix @xmath78 . from @xmath48",
    "it is then easy to determine the ideal values of the measured impedances and the relative errors due to the contact resistances .",
    "these results are shown in table  [ tab : single_device_connections ] , and references are given for comparison .",
