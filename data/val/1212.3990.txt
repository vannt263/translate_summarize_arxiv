    "detecting particle dark matter ( dm ) is one of the most important task for the modern physics , although its existence has been revealed through astronomical observations for more than seventy years .",
    "the dm particles could annihilate themselves to produce standard model ( sm ) particles such as electrons / positrons , proton / antiprotons , @xmath0-ray photons and neutrinos , which provides us a chance to detect the dm indirectly in the cosmic radiation .",
    "the fermi large area telescope ( fermi - lat ) is currently the best detector for @xmath0-ray detection in space and could substantially increase the sensitivity for dm search .    the dwarf spheroidal satellites ( dsphs ) in the milky way are generally regarded as ideal candidates when searching for possible dm annihilation signals due to their high dm content and low baryonic contamination .",
    "the search for @xmath0-ray emission from dsphs with fermi - lat data was performed in many works @xcite . without finding any significant `` signal '' from these targets ,",
    "stringent upper limits on dm annihilation cross section can be derived .",
    "it was shown that for @xmath1 gev the canonical thermally produced dm with cross section @xmath2 @xmath3 s@xmath4 was ruled out with two - year fermi - lat observations on 10 dsphs @xcite ( see also @xcite for similar conclusion ) .",
    "there are usually two ways to extract the limits on dm models from the @xmath0-ray observations .",
    "the most conservative and dm - model - independent way is to require the dm - induced signal not to exceed the flux / limit of specific source .",
    "but in this way , the spectral and spatial information of dm is missing and the constraint is usually weak - ray flux was derived through subtracting the photon counts of choosen `` background '' region from the `` signal '' region . ] . another way which could be more realistic is to incorporate the expected @xmath0-ray spectrum and/or the sky map in the analysis .",
    "however , it needs to input the model of dm when analyzing the data and is not convenient for generic purpose .    in this work",
    "we alternatively adopt a more general way to extract the limits on the @xmath0-ray emission of the dsphs from fermi - lat data .",
    "the fermi - lat observational data are binned into a series of energy bins , and the likelihood in each energy bin is calculated assuming a constant value of the flux from dm annihilation in this energy bin . given any shape of the @xmath0-ray spectrum",
    ", we can easily derive the total likelihood with such a likelihood map on `` energy - flux '' plane .",
    "this method is model - independent in the level of extracting the likelihood of @xmath0-ray flux in each energy bin , and it is more flexible and time - saving to subsequently discuss any kind of particle models . the detailed description of the method is given in sec .",
    "ii . in sec .",
    "iii we apply this method to several dm models .",
    "in this section , we will describe the methodology of how to build a particle model - independent likelihood map .",
    "the @xmath0-ray flux from annihilation of dm in a dsph is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the mass of dm particle , @xmath7 is the average velocity - weighted annihilation cross section , @xmath8 is the @xmath0-ray yield spectrum of one annihilation of a dm pair , and @xmath9 is the integral density square of dm .    from fermi - lat 2-year result @xcite , we can see @xmath7 with the @xmath10 channel for @xmath11 gev is lower than the result expected from thermal equilibrium , @xmath12 .",
    "it could be a hint that fermi - lat can rule out dm annihilation to @xmath10 , at least , at the lower mass region , @xmath13 gev .",
    "however , the above information can not be true for realistic dm models . in most of particle models such as supersymmetry ( susy )",
    ", @xmath0-rays can be produced via several annihilation channels .",
    "moreover , @xmath8 can differ from one point to another in the susy parameter space",
    ". therefore it will be more useful to have a likelihood map which does not depend on a pre - determined @xmath8 .",
    "to do so , we bin the photons into small energy bins @xmath14 $ ] , and assume the differential energy spectrum @xmath8 in the small energy interval to be constant @xmath15 . then the likelihood is built based on two new variables , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the index of energy bin and @xmath19 is the index of individual dsph .",
    "we adopt the same 10 dsphs in this study as in @xcite .    to calculate the likelihood from fermi - lat data we employ @xmath20-year fermi - lat data recorded from 4 august 2008 to 2 august 2012 , with the pass 7 photon selection .",
    "the lat scientific tools version v9r27p1 are used for the analysis .",
    "the `` source '' ( evclass=2 ) event class is selected , and the recommended filter cut `` ( data_qual==1 ) & & ( lat_config==1 ) & & abs(rock_angle)@xmath21 '' is applied .",
    "the photon energy range is choosen from @xmath22 mev to @xmath22 gev , and the region - of - interest ( roi ) is adopted to be a @xmath23 box centered around the center of each dsph .",
    "the instrument response function used is `` p7source_v6 '' . for the diffuse background",
    ", we use the galactic diffuse model gal_2yearp7v6_v0.fits and the isotropic diffuse spectrum iso_p7v6source.txt provided by the fermi science support center .",
    "the point sources of the second lat source catalog are also included in the modeling @xcite .",
    "the binned likelihood method is used to calculate the likelihood @xmath24 .",
    "the dm contribution is modelled as a point source located at the central position of each dsph . in the analysis",
    "the free parameters include all the nomalizations of the second lat sources in the roi , and the normalizations of the two diffuse backgrounds .",
    "we follow the method described in @xcite to combine the results of different dsphs .",
    "note that @xmath25 factor is absorbed in @xmath26 when calculating @xmath24 .",
    "to get rid of the effect of @xmath25 , we define @xmath27 and write the joint likelihood function as @xmath28 ^ 2/2\\sigma_{j}^2}\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 represents the binned @xmath0-ray data and @xmath30 are the roi - dependent model parameters . @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the mean and standard deviations of the gaussian distribution of @xmath33 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the @xmath34-factors are weakly dependent on the density profile of the halo .",
    "taking draco as an example , the @xmath34 factor for burkert profile @xcite according to the stellar kinematics @xcite is similar with that for nfw profile as given in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite perform a scan with five halo parameters varied .",
    "interestingly , they found that the highly cuspy nfw profile and a flat isothermal core profile could fit the data equally well and the posterior distribution of @xmath34 was still similar with the value given in @xcite . in this work",

    "for each given ( @xmath16 , @xmath41 ) point , we vary all the nuisance parameters as well as @xmath45 , known as the `` profile likelihood '' technique @xcite , and take the maximum likelihood of eq .",

    "[ fig : like_map ] are totally independent of the theoretical model parameters of dm , such as @xmath48 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "it indicates that any expected @xmath0-ray flux should not exceed the limits in the whole energy range from 0.2 gev to 200 gev .",
    "however , such a requirement is too conservative compared with the combined likelihood of all energy bins ( see the next paragraph ) .",
    "if one wants to discuss the specific models of the @xmath0-ray emission and derive the constraints on the specific model parameters such as @xmath49 of dm annihilation , the spectral information will be required .",

    "also the two - year result given in @xcite is shown .",
    "the results show that the 4-yr constraint is even weaker than that of 2-yr constraint .",
    "similar result was also reported recently @xcite , and it was possibly due to the update to pass 7 of the data and the statistical fluctuations .",

    "three particle models , a toy model , the effective dm model , and the supersymmetry neutralino dm are adopted as examples .      to generalize the upper limit on @xmath54 plane , we design a toy dm model which annihilates to @xmath0-rays only via @xmath10 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 channels .",
    "we only consider these three channels because the differences between them are relatively large compared with other channels .    with the 4-year likelihood map ( fig .",

    "[ fig : data_driven ] , we present 68% ( inner ) and 95% ( outer ) contours on the @xmath65 using the profile likelihood method .",

    ", @xmath67 is the region within the contours . compared with fig .",
    "[ fig : sv_comp ] , we can clearly see that the 95% upper limit of this toy model is significantly higher than that of @xmath10 channel only for @xmath68 gev and slightly higher for lower masses .",
    "this is because of the inclusion of @xmath55 channel in the toy model . according to the results in @xcite , for @xmath69 gev the constraints on @xmath57 and @xmath58 are comparable , while for higher dm",
    "mass the constraint on @xmath58 becomes much weaker than that on @xmath57 .",
    "including @xmath56 channel also makes the total constraint weaker .       the 95% lower limits on @xmath70 for each operator from the 4-year fermi - lat dsph data .",
    "]    before assuming particular dm models , we may adopt an effective interaction approach to describe the interactions of the dm particle with the sm particles @xcite .",
    "in such scenario , the dm particle exists in a hidden sector , which communicates with the sm sector via a heavy degree of freedom in the connector sector . at energy scale well below this heavy mediator",
    "we can introduce a new energy scales @xmath70 to describe the effective couplings between dm and sm fermions . in this study , we consider the interactions between fermionic dm field @xmath71 and sm fermion @xmath72 described by scalar ( @xmath73 ) , vector ( @xmath74 ) or axial ( @xmath75 ) operators @xmath76 where @xmath77 is an effective coupling constant of order @xmath78 that can be absorbed into @xmath79 and @xmath72 runs over all the lepton and quark states . except @xmath73",

    "we follow the calculation in @xcite to obtain @xmath7 and @xmath8 for the effective dm models , and constrain each of the effective operators using the 4-year fermi - lat dsph data .",
    "since we assume a universal coupling for all the fermions and the top quark channel only opens at @xmath81 gev , the upper limits of @xmath7 of these three operators at low mass region @xmath82 gev behave like @xmath10 channel in fig .",

    "<S> observation of @xmath0-rays from dwarf galaxies is an effective way to search for particle dark matter . using 4-year data of fermi - lat observations on a series of milky way satellites , </S>",

    "<S> instead of giving prior information about the energy spectrum of dark matter annihilation , we bin the fermi - lat data into several energy bins and build a likelihood map in the `` energy bin - flux '' plane . </S>",
    "<S> the final likelihood of any spectrum can be easily derived through combining the likelihood of all the energy bins . </S>",
    "<S> it gives consistent result with that directly calculated using the fermi scientific tool . </S>",
    "<S> this method is very efficient for the study of any specific dark matter models with @xmath0-rays . </S>",
    "<S> we use the new likelihood map with fermi - lat 4 year data to fit the parameter space in three representative dark matter models : i ) toy dark matter model , ii ) effective dark matter operators , and iii ) supersymmetric neutralino dark matter . </S>"
