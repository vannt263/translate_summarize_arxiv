    "the majority rule model ( mr ) is a simple description for consensus formation in an interacting population .",
    "the model consists of @xmath0 spins ( opinions ) that are fixed on lattice sites , and each spin can assume the states @xmath1 or @xmath2 , corresponding to two opposite opinions .",
    "spins evolve by the following two steps : first , pick a group of spins of fixed odd size @xmath3 ; second , all the spins in this group adopt the state of the local group majority ( fig .  [ process ] ) .",
    "these two steps are repeated until a final consensus is necessarily reached .",
    "our goal is to understand basic properties of this approach to consensus in finite spatial dimensions .",
    "a general form of this majority rule dynamics was introduced by galam @xcite in which a variable number of groups of arbitrary size are formed simultaneously and then majority rule is simultaneously applied to each group .",
    "our implementation of majority rule , in which only a single small group is updated at each time step , allows for considerable analytical progress in the mean - field limit @xcite and also makes it convenient to simulate the model , especially in high dimensions .    in a previous study of the mr model @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the average time until consensus is reached is proportional to the logarithm of the number of spins @xmath0 in the system in the mean - field limit .",
    "on the other hand , for finite dimensions , numerical simulations suggested that the most probable consensus time grows as a power law in @xmath0 , with an exponent that decreases as the spatial dimension increases .",
    "mean - field behavior was not reproduced even in four dimensions , indicating a still larger value for the upper critical dimension of the mr model .    in this article",
    ", we focus on the mr model in finite spatial dimensions . the questions that we will investigate are :",
    "what is the geometry of single - opinion domains ? how long does it take to reach consensus ?",
    "how do basic system parameters affect the consensus time ?",
    "we find that the probability distribution for the consensus time involves two very different time scales when the spatial dimension is greater than one .",
    "the longer time scale arises from configurations in which opposite - opinion domains organize into coherent geometries  stripes in two dimensions , slabs in three dimension , _",
    "etc_. while the probability for the system to reach such a coherent state decreases as the spatial dimension is increased ",
    "approximately @xmath4 in two dimensions and @xmath5 in three dimensions ",
    "we believe that this probability remains non - zero in all finite spatial dimension .",
    "more importantly , the time needed to reach final consensus from these coherent states is extremely long .",
    "these configurations therefore give the dominant contribution to the mean consensus time .",
    "to put our results in context , it is instructive to compare the mr model with two fundamental kinetic spin models , namely , the voter model ( vm ) @xcite , and the kinetic ising model with zero - temperature glauber kinetics ( ig ) @xcite . the vm describes consensus formation in a population of individuals with zero self confidence . in an update step of the vm ,",
    "a spin is selected at random and it blindly adopts the state of a randomly - selected neighbor .",
    "this step is repeated until consensus is necessarily reached . because of the underlying linearity of the vm spin - flip rate on the number of anti - aligned nearest neighbors , the vm is exactly soluble in all spatial dimensions @xcite . in particular , for an @xmath0-spin system in @xmath6 dimensions with zero initial magnetization , the consensus time scales as @xmath0 for @xmath7 , as @xmath8 in @xmath9 ( the critical dimension of the vm ) , and as @xmath10 in @xmath11 . because the average magnetization is conserved , the probability that the system eventually ends with all @xmath12 spins equals the initial density of @xmath12 spins in all spatial dimensions .    in contrast , the zero - temperature kinetics of the ig model obeys a form of majority rule . in the update step , a flippable spin ( those with zero or positive energy ) is picked at random and it adopts the state of the majority in its interaction neighborhood . in the case of a tie in the neighborhood state ( which can happen on bipartite lattices ) , the selected spin flips with probability 1/2 .",
    "this elemental update step is repeated until no flippable spins are left . at early times , coarsening domains form whose typical length scale grows as @xmath13 due to an underlying diffusive dynamics @xcite .",
    "the primary operational difference between the ig and mr models is that in the latter _ all _ the spins within the neighborhood flip , a feature that also occurs in galam s model @xcite and also in the sznajd model @xcite of social influence , where a small group that is in consensus can influence other spins at the periphery of the group .",
    "this distinction in the update rule has fundamental consequences . in the ig model ,",
    "infinitely long - lived metastable states can occur that consist of perfectly flat interfaces in @xmath9 , or states where all interfaces have zero net curvature for @xmath14 ref .",
    "in contrast , consensus is the only possible final state in the mr model .",
    "nevertheless , both the zero - temperature ig model and the mr model have anomalous kinetics because of the existence of very long - lived transient states .    in sec .",
    "ii , we present simulation results for the anomalous behavior of the consensus time distribution and the two basic controlling time scales . then in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the role of the long - lived coherent states that dominate the asymptotic tail of the consensus time distribution . a qualitative argument for the lifetime of these states",

    "once a stripe state is formed , the evolution to ultimate consensus is controlled by the time required for the two interfaces that define the stripe to meet and annihilate . in one dimension ,",
    "it is easy to see that each isolated interface between @xmath12 and @xmath15 spins moves by free diffusion .",
    "when two interfaces approach to nearest - neighbor separation they necessarily annihilate .",

    "therefore the time for the last two domain walls to annihilate is proportional to @xmath89 , where @xmath73 is the linear dimension of the system .",
    "further , because the system is controlled by the meeting of two random walks on a finite ring , the consensus time distribution has an exponential decay of the form @xmath90 @xcite .    in two and three dimensions ,",
    "the interfaces between stripes are quite smooth ( figs .",
    "[ pics ] & [ slab ] ) and the scaling of the interface width on the transverse dimension of the system appears to be in the edwards - wilkinson universality class @xcite .",

    "the growth of the width is even slower and the saturation value of the width is consistent with a logarithmic dependence on @xmath73 .",
    "thus it is the diffusion of the interface as a whole rather than fluctuations in the interface shape that determines the lifetime of the stripe state .",
    "since the interfaces are typically separated by a distance of order @xmath73 when they are first formed , the lifetime @xmath97 of the stripe state should therefore given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the diffusion coefficient of a single interface with transverse dimension @xmath73 .",

    "we anticipate that analogous coherent states arise in higher spatial dimensions .",

    "first , it would be worthwhile to determine the value of the upper critical dimension of the mr model .",
    "an exact analysis of this model on the complete graph , where all spins are nearest neighbors of each other , showed that the mean consensus time grows as @xmath113 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the simulations presented here and in @xcite suggested that the mean consensus time grows as a power law in @xmath0 for spatial dimensions 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "these two facts suggest that the upper critical dimension of the mr model is greater than 4",
    ". it would be worthwhile to have a theoretical understanding for the apparently large value of the upper critical dimension .",
    "we also believe it will be fruitful to study simple extensions of the mr model with more stringent conditions for achieving consensus .",
    "one example is to have a higher threshold than simple majority before the opinion of a group is swayed . while a higher threshold will obviously slow the dynamics , it should be interesting to investigate whether this modification leads to different scaling properties for the mean consensus time and the distribution of consensus times .",
    "a more intriguing generalization arises when each spin has more than two opinions , where we anticipate new types of dynamical behavior . with more than two states , the possibility of a dynamically - stable steady state that consists of coalescing and coexisting multiple opinion groups was discussed in the framework of the `` stochastic seceder '' model @xcite . in the context of our majority rule model ,",
    "there obviously will be slower dynamics because it may be possible to have a group with no local majority , but only a local plurality .",
    "such a group would not evolve according to the majority rule dynamics .",
    "thus configurations in which there is no majority in each group represent another absorbing state for the dynamics . in the mean - field limit",
    ", we find that such a system never reaches this frustrated state , as the corresponding fixed point of equal concentrations of all species is unstable @xcite .",
    "instead , for a system with more than two opinion states , the time to reach ultimate consensus is merely increased by a multiplicative factor compared to the two - opinion mr model .",
    "however , for finite spatial dimensions , the existence of more than two opinions appears to have a more significant effect on the long - time behavior that depends fundamentally on the interplay between the group size and the number of states . when there are many distinct local majorities in the initial state the group dynamics has a primarily diffusive character .",
    "however , when there is of the order of one local majority , the opinion of this group quickly overtakes the entire system .",
    "we thank pablo hurtado , paul krapivsky , mauro mobilia , and federico vazquez for helpful discussions and advice .",
    "we also thank nsf grant dmr0227670 for financial support of this research ."
