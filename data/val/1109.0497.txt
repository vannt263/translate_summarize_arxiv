    "the study of noise induced transport in anisotropic spatially periodic systems is a relevant subject for many problems in physics @xcite and biology @xcite , and is also acquiring an increasing interest due to possible applications in the development of technological devices @xcite .",
    "in general , the basic models consider a particle in an external spatially periodic potential with broken symmetry ( the _ ratchet - potential _ ) , and subject to an additional signal or source of fluctuations which generates the nonequilibrium condition necessary for the emergence of directional transport @xcite .",
    "thermal noise is also usually considered , although depending on the nature of the nonequilibrium forces it may be not a fundamental ingredient .",
    "ratchet models can be classified in two main classes according to the way in which the non equilibrium forcing affects the particle dynamics .",
    "simple additive nonequilibrium forces lead to the so called _ rocking ratchets _ , while , when the signal enters as a multiplicative modulation of the ratchet potential , we speak of _ flashing ratchets_. systems combining the two kind of forcings can also been considered  @xcite .",
    "recently , two simultaneous papers  @xcite have shown that a minimal setup for producing directional transport is obtained by considering a simple static ratchet potential and an additive white symmetric lvy @xcite noise as the only two ingredients . here",
    "we will refer to such system as the _",
    "static _ or _ non flashing",
    "_ lvy ratchet .",
    "the preferred direction of motion for such system is found to be towards the steepest slope of the potential .",
    "the effect was explained in @xcite as a consequence of the large lvy jumps , which lead the particles to the flatter zones of the potential with larger probability than to the steeper zones . in the limit case in which the stability parameter @xmath0 @xcite defining the lvy noise is set to be equal to @xmath1 ,",
    "the lvy distribution becomes gaussian@xcite and the equilibrium situation with vanishing current is recovered .",
    "after the mentioned pioneering papers on the static lvy ratchet , several works have appeared providing further analysis of the system and studying different generalizations . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that an inversion of current can be obtained by considering a time periodic modulation of the chirality of the lvy noise .",
    "reference @xcite studies inertial effects and propose a way of measuring the rectification efficiency in lvy ratchets . in @xcite , the weak noise limit is analyzed . in @xcite , the related problem of the spatially tempered fractional fokker - planck equation",
    "is studied .",
    "reference @xcite analyzes the competition between lvy forcing and a periodic a.c . driving in a ratchet system , while @xcite studies the coexistence of lvy flights and subdiffusion .",
    "the increasing interest in ratchet systems influenced by lvy noises is due to various facts .",
    "firstly , there is an intrinsic theoretical significance in the generalizations of previous ratchet models to account for cases where fluctuations present long tailed probability distribution , giving rise to anomalously large particle displacements .",
    "moreover , since lvy noises may induce divergencies in the moments of the velocity distributions @xcite , there is an additional challenge in providing the appropriate quantities to measure currents @xcite , particle dispersion @xcite and efficiencies @xcite . from another point of view",
    ", lvy ratchets may be of direct interest for problems in magnetically confined fusion plasmas @xcite .",
    "lvy ratchets might be also of interest for atomic transport in dissipative optical lattices .",
    "cold atom ratchets have been indeed recently studied experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite , whereas anomalous dynamics described by lvy statistics were also reported for the same system  @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we study the dynamics of a ratchet system influenced by two different signals inducing non equilibrium conditions : a dichotomic multiplicative noise and an additive lvy forcing .",
    "we analyze both the langevin and fokker - plank approaches , focusing mainly on the latter . in different limit situations ,",
    "the model generalizes various previous systems found in the literature .",
    "as we will see , for fast , slow and null flashing we recover different versions of the static lvy ratchet , while for @xmath2 we recover a version of the well known flashing ratchet with thermal noise @xcite .",
    "in particular we find that flashing allows both to enhance and diminish in a broad range the static ratchet current depending on the frequencies of flashing .",
    "our results thus extend those for dichotomous flashing ratchets with gaussian noise to the case of broadly distributed noise .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a dichotomous flashing ratchet with lvy noise was shortly analyzed in the past as part of other studies on the influence of supperdiffusion on directional motion @xcite .",
    "however , only heuristic arguments were given by considering an adiabatic approximation which assumes relatively slow flashing .",
    "interestingly , as the study is previous to the findings in @xcite and @xcite , the contribution to directional transport during the `` on '' stage of the flashing was naturally ignored .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec_model ]",
    "we introduce the model . in section [ sec_sol ]",
    "we give the solution of the fokker - planck equation . in section [ sec_limitsituations ]",
    "we analyze some limit situations which connect our results with previous results for other systems studied in the literature . in section [ sec_results ]",
    "we present a detailed numerical analysis of the results considering a particular but standard ratchet potential .",
    "section [ sec_conclusion ] is devoted to our conclusions and some final remarks .",
    "we consider the one - dimensional overdamped motion of a particle at position @xmath3 subject to a randomly fluctuating ratchet potential @xmath4 , and to an additive lvy random force @xmath5 .",
    "this situation is described by the langevin equation @xmath6 we consider @xmath5 as a symmetric @xmath0-stable lvy noise with @xmath7 and intensity @xmath8 , described by the characteristic function @xmath9 \\rangle = \\exp[-\\chi|k|^\\alpha \\delta t]$ ]  @xcite .",
    "we consider a ratchet potential with spatial period @xmath10 and amplitude @xmath11 , and the multiplicative noise @xmath12 as a dichotomous markov process @xcite taking the value of @xmath13 ( mode a ) or @xmath14 ( mode b ) , switching between these modes at rates @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "equation ( [ ec_langevin ] ) , thus , models a particle in a ratchet potential @xmath17 that switches between ` on ' and ` off ' states with transition rates @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively ( see figure [ fig_0a ] ) .",
    "we are interested in the steady - state directional transport that can be generated in this system",
    ". this can be quantified by the long - time limit of the average velocity @xmath18 , where @xmath19 stands for the average over all possible realizations of @xmath5 and @xmath12 .",
    "note that we only consider the domain @xmath20 since it was shown that transport is highly inefficient in lvy ratchets for @xmath21 due to the divergencies of the mean value of lvy distributions @xcite .",
    "moreover , the analysis in such parameter region demands special care for defining the mean velocity and current @xcite .",
    "note that , our parameter region of interest includes the case @xmath22 , for which the lvy noise becomes gaussian white noise and ( [ ec_langevin ] ) describes the dichotomous flashing ratchet studied in @xcite . on the other hand , for @xmath23 , equation ( [ ec_langevin ] ) corresponds to the static or non flashing lvy ratchet mentioned in the introduction and recently analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the langevin equation ( [ ec_langevin ] ) was solved by using a standard algorithm ( see @xcite and references in @xcite and @xcite ) for which the numbers distributed according to lvy laws were obtained by the method explained in @xcite .    as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "most of our analysis will be done using the fokker - planck approach to the problem . in order to present it ,",
    "we first consider a more general situation in which the potential in state b can be non vanishing , and we introduce the probability densities @xmath24 and @xmath25 of finding the particle at position @xmath26 and time @xmath27 in the a and b modes respectively .",
    "for such a system we have the following coupled fokker - planck equations for the probability densities @xmath28 here , latexmath:[$\\partial_x^{\\alpha } \\equiv \\partial^{\\alpha}/\\partial    order @xmath0  @xcite , while @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the external potentials considered in states a and b. for @xmath32 , the system ( [ ec_fokkerplanck ] ) is equivalent to the langevin equation ( [ ec_langevin ] ) .",
    "we will limit to such a case when performing our analysis of transport and presenting our numerical results .",
    "however , the method of solution of the fokker - planck equation will be introduced ( up to some point ) for an arbitrary potential @xmath31 , since this leads to more general and symmetrical expressions .    within the fokker - planck framework",
    ", the probability current @xmath33 is obtained from the continuity equation @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the probability density regardless of the mode . in the long - time limit @xmath36 and",
    "the current reaches the spatially constant value @xmath37 characterizing the average directed motion or ratchet response . since the steady - state solutions we are interested in , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , are periodic with the period @xmath10",
    ", we can direclty solve ( [ ec_fokkerplanck ] ) for @xmath40 in the interval @xmath41 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the steady - state current is then simply related to the average velocity in the langevin description , @xmath42 .",
    "we exploit the fact that the steady - state solution we seek is periodic with the period @xmath10 of the ratchet potential by using discrete fourier transforms , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 with @xmath45 an integer and @xmath46 denotes the correponding fourier amplitude .",
    "in particular , the prescription @xmath47_k}=-|k|^{\\alpha } \\tilde{f}_k$ ] for the fourier transform of the fractional derivative , valid in an infinite or periodic support , greatly simplifies our method as it avoids the complications due to the nonlocal nature of the fractional laplacian operator that can arise for different boundary conditions that break translational invariance in bounded domains @xcite .",
    "fourier transforming ( [ ec_fokkerplanck ] ) gives @xmath48 where we have used ( and use from now on ) indistintevily the wave vector name , eg @xmath49 , to denote both its value , @xmath50 and its associated integer , @xmath51 , to avoid excesive notation . by construction equation ( [ ec_ftfpeqs ] )",
    "only admit periodic initial conditions with period @xmath10 .",
    "this is not important as we will be interested in the steady - state limit @xmath52 , whose solution is unique and thus independent of the initial condition .",
    "equation ( [ ec_ftfpeqs ] ) must be solved with the constraint @xmath53 , arising from the normalization of the entire probability function @xmath54 .",
    "this leads inmediately to the zero - mode steady - state solution @xmath55 which physically simply states that the probability of finding the system in the a and b modes regardless of the particle position , are controlled by the average fraction of time spent on each mode , @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively , where @xmath58 .    using the zero - mode solution of ( [ ec_fpzeromode ] ) the system ( [ ec_ftfpeqs ] )",
    "can be written as an inhomogeneous system for all the components @xmath59 and @xmath60 with @xmath61 , @xmath62 where we have defined the duty ratio or fraction of time spent in the a mode , @xmath63 . in the particular case of a potential that is stochastically switched on and off , we have @xmath64 and @xmath65 and thus @xmath66 . using the second equation in the system of eqs .",
    "( [ ec_ftfpeqs2 ] ) we obtain , @xmath67 and therefore the problem is reduced to solve , @xmath68 with @xmath69 , from ( [ ec_fpzeromode ] ) . in a more compact matrix notation we have @xmath70 where the components of the matrices @xmath71 , @xmath72 and the vector @xmath73 are defined as , for @xmath74 , @xmath75 in this way , @xmath71 and @xmath76 depend only on the fourier components of the ratchet potencial @xmath17 , while the diagonal matrix @xmath71 concentrates , for fixed @xmath77 , all the dependence with the external parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath8 and @xmath0 .    finally , in order to compute the current we consider the fourier - transformed continuity equation @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "adding the two equations ( [ ec_ftfpeqs ] ) together , we can identify : @xmath80 as indicated in the previous section , the current in the stationary regime is a constant .",
    "this can be seen from ( [ contfou ] ) , which for @xmath81 implies @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "thus , assuming @xmath84 , the stationary current is simply @xmath85    note that the solution for the general case @xmath86 demands dealing with the whole system ( [ ec_ftfpeqs2 ] ) .",
    "clearly , although the procedure is a little bit more intricate , the equations can also be written in matrix form and solved for the variables @xmath59 and @xmath60 , enabling the calculation of the current .",
    "considering a potential @xmath87 of amplitude @xmath11 and period @xmath10 , a straight forward dimensional analysis of ( [ ec_unasola ] ) shows that the fokker - planck solutions for the probability distribution and current are of the form @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are dimensionless functions .",
    "thus , there are essentially four relevant parameters .",
    "note that the scaled ` on ' rate @xmath91 can be considered as a relevant parameter instead of @xmath77 or instead of @xmath92 . in",
    "the following we will speak alternatively of the three parameters depending on the feature we want to stress . note that for @xmath93 , ( [ ec_unasola ] ) reduces to the equation for the standard , non flashing , lvy ratchet @xcite .",
    "the relaxation time for a particle in the potential @xmath17 is expected to be a relevant characteristic time of the system . according to the deterministic part of ( [ ec_langevin ] ) , considering a typical length @xmath10 and a velocity @xmath94 , we get @xmath95 as the typical relaxation time .",
    "it is interesting to note thus , that the scaled parameters @xmath96 and @xmath91 are simply measures of the switching rates in the time scale of the inverse of the relaxation time .",
    "equivalently , @xmath97 can be interpreted as a super - diffusion time which in the solution of the fokker - planck equation appears weighted to the relaxation time .",
    "note that in the gaussian limit we get the usual expression for the diffusion time @xmath98 .    by modifying @xmath15 and @xmath16 but keeping constant their ratio ( i.e. keeping @xmath77 constant )",
    ", we can analytically study the limits of infinitely slow and infinitely fast switching without changing the relative residence times . using ( [ ec_unasola ] ) the calculation of these limits is very simple and instructive .      in the infinitely slow switching case we have @xmath99 and @xmath100 , keeping @xmath77 constant .",
    "replacing this in ( [ ec_unasola ] ) and using ( [ ec_fpzeromode ] ) , we can write @xmath101 these equations are identical to the non - flashing lvy ratchet equations for @xmath102 . if we call @xmath103 the real - space static lvy ratchet solution in a potential @xmath104 , we have , in this slow switching limit , @xmath105 where the second equation follows from ( [ ec_current ] ) . intuitively , the idea is that the rates are so large that the system reaches the steady state when the potential is ` on ' and when it is ` off ' , and having the transients between these modes a negligible contribution , the total current is just an average of the two corresponding steady state currents . according to ( [ ec_unasola ] ) the result",
    "is expected to be a very good approximation when the following relations hold between the scaled parameters : @xmath106 and @xmath107 ( i.e. @xmath108 and @xmath109 ) .",
    "we will check this in section [ sec_results ] when analyzing transport for the case of a standard ratchet potential .      in the infinitely fast switching case we have @xmath110 and @xmath111 , keeping @xmath77 constant .",
    "replacing this in ( [ ec_unasola ] ) the bracketed term becomes @xmath112 .",
    "we can thus write , @xmath113 which again correspond to the non - flashing ratchet equations for the variable @xmath114 but in the renormalized potential @xmath115 .",
    "thus , the solution in this fast - switching limit is @xmath116 in this case , the current for the flashing lvy ratchet is the same as for a system where the same potential is always  onbut with an intensity rescaled by @xmath77 .",
    "this is intuitively evident : the potential is being switched so fastly that the particle can only ` feel ' the temporal average of the potential ( i.e. @xmath117 ) . according to ( [ ec_unasola ] ) the limit results in ( [ ec_fastsolution ] )",
    "are expected to be valid for @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "we have verified this using a standard differentiable ratchet potential , as we will show in section [ sec_results ] .",
    "note however that , at variance with what happens in the slow limit , the fast limit is not valid for all the fourier modes .",
    "the denominator of the bracketed term in ( [ ec_unasola ] ) shows that the fast approximation is only valid for fourier modes that satisfy @xmath120 .",
    "nevertheless , if the potential is an analytic function the probability density function , @xmath121 should also be an analytic function , which implies that the coefficients of its fourier expansion decay exponentially with @xmath49 .",
    "therefore we expect that the higher fourier modes that are not well approximated in the fast limit do not change the overall limit of the probability density .      using a simple perturbation analysis in ( [ ec_unasola ] )",
    "we can obtain the lowest order corrections to the infinitely slow and fast switching limits described above , with @xmath15 and @xmath122 the small parameters , respectively , for a fixed value of @xmath77 .    approaching the infinitely slow limit a natural ansatz is to propose , @xmath123 , with @xmath124 given by ( [ ec_slowsolution ] ) . inserting this ansatz in ( [ ec_unasola ] ) we get the following result for the fourier - transformed first order correction for @xmath125 , @xmath126 for various particular potentials",
    "we confirm numerically that ( [ ec_1stslow ] ) has solutions with finite currents . as we will see , this is also consistent with the slow switching behaviour found in the full numerical solution discussed in the next section .",
    "we therefore conclude that in the absence of particular symmetries , the first order correction generically does not vanish .",
    "we thus predict @xmath127 for small enough @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) at fixed @xmath77 , with @xmath128 given by ( [ ec_slowsolution ] ) .",
    "similarly , approaching the infinitely fast switching limit a natural anzats is to propose @xmath129 , with @xmath130 given by ( [ ec_fastsolution ] ) . inserting this ansatz in ( [ ec_unasola ] )",
    "we get the following result for the fourier - transformed first order correction for @xmath125 , @xmath131 for large enough @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) at fixed @xmath77 , with @xmath132 given by ( [ ec_fastsolution ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that the asymptotic behavior of the currents that we have found ( equations ( [ ec_slowcorrection ] ) and ( [ ec_fastcorrection ] ) ) are also valid for the case of gaussian noise ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "however , they do not coincide with the corresponding limits found for a randomly flashed triangular ratchet @xcite and for a periodically pulsated ratchet with a frequency @xmath133 @xcite . in this last case ,",
    "the corrections analytically found in the slow and fast limits are @xmath134 and @xmath135 respectively .",
    "the discrepancy is most likely due simply to the difference between a stochastic and a deterministic switching of the potential .    in the case of @xcite , however , the discrepancy is more significative because the system analyzed is also a ( dichotomous ) stochastically flashed ratchet . using an heuristic argument , astumian and bier",
    "provide an expression for the current as a function of what we have called @xmath15 ( using @xmath136 ) , which in the slow and fast limits behaves as @xmath137 and @xmath138 . one of the possible reasons for this difference could be that that , in the case of a non analytic potential , the fourier coefficients do not decay fast enough for our arguments to be valid .",
    "another possible reason could be that the qualitative argument in @xcite is not correct in the limits of fast and slow switching .",
    "now we consider a standard ratchet potential @xcite @xmath139,\\ ] ] with period @xmath140 and barriers of amplitude @xmath141 . for this choice of the potential",
    ", we analyze the dependence of the current on the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath0 characterizing the lvy noise , and on the transitions rates @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the results of this section correspond , thus , to the system ( [ ec_langevin ] ) considering the potential @xmath17 given in ( [ ec_potencial ] ) or , equivalently , to the fokker - planck equation ( [ ec_fokkerplanck ] ) with @xmath142 and @xmath32 . the results for the current given throughout this section correspond mostly to the fokker - planck formalism . however , in order to show the complete agreement between the two formalisms we also include langevin results for some specific cases .",
    "concerning the solution of the fokker - planck equation , the fourier transform of @xmath17 is simply @xmath143,\\ ] ] where @xmath144 is the kroneker delta .",
    "thus , the matrix @xmath71 given in ( [ ec_matrix ] ) is penta - diagonal . despite this simplification , the system ( [ ec_ftfpeqsmat ] )",
    "can only be solved numerically , for what we typically consider a number of fourier modes ranging from @xmath145 for @xmath146 to @xmath147 for @xmath0 close to @xmath13 .",
    "this guarantees that our solutions closely approximate those of the continum limit if the lvy noise intensity satisfy @xmath148 , with @xmath149 the maximum wave vector .",
    "we first consider the case of equal transitions rates between a and b states .",
    "this means that the potential is ",
    "onand ` off ' the same fraction of time , on average .",
    "we thus have @xmath150 and we define @xmath151 .    in figure [ fig_j_vs_chi ]",
    "we show the current as a function of the noise power @xmath8 for several values of the transition rate @xmath152 and two different values of @xmath0 . as usual in most ratchet systems , in all the cases studied we see that the current attains a maximum at an optimal noise intensity , while it decreases to zero for low and large intensities .",
    "the optimal value of @xmath8 depends only slightly on @xmath152 . as we can see",
    ", it decreases in a factor of order @xmath153 when changing @xmath152 in six orders of magnitude .",
    "we can also see that it decreases with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "in all the cases studied the optimal value of @xmath8 remains in the interval between @xmath154 and @xmath11 .",

    "however , we have not been able to obtain the exact analytical limit law within our fokker - planck approach .",
    "note that , for the two values of @xmath0 analyzed in figure [ fig_j_vs_chi ] , we find that @xmath167 produces the largest value of @xmath37 for almost all values of @xmath8 , while larger and smaller transition rates lead almost always to smaller currents .",

    "figure [ fig_j_vs_g ] also shows the validity of the asymptotic formulas found in section [ sec_limitsituations ] for the limits of small and large @xmath152 , and of the perturbative analysis close to them .",
    "another fact that can be observed in figure [ fig_j_vs_g ] is that , for a fixed flashing mechanism ( fixed @xmath152 ) and a fixed noise intensity , lvy noise leads almost always to larger values of @xmath37 than gaussian noise .",

    "when considering small enough @xmath8 or large enough @xmath0 , the inclusion of an appropriate flashing mechanism improves the performance of the static ratchet .",
    "in contrast , for large @xmath8 or small @xmath0 , the largest value of @xmath37 is obtained considering a slow flashing mechanism close the static ratchet ( i.e. @xmath93 ) .",
    "we thus see that the currents depend separately and richly on both , @xmath15 and @xmath77 , allowing us to both enhance or decrease the static lvy ratchet currents for fixed noise parameters .     and",

    "our results provide a complete generalization of previous studies on ` non - flashed ' lvy ratchets and on standard flashing ratchets with gaussian noises .",
    "we have presented a complete analysis of the two - variable fractional fokker - planck equation associated to the system .",
    "our fourier treatment allowed us to convert analytically the system of partial differential equations in an infinite - matrix linear system that can be easily solved numerically considering an appropriate truncation .",
    "moreover , we were able to provide analytical asymptotic laws for slow and fast flashing that behave respectively as @xmath191 and @xmath192 , where @xmath152 is the flashing frequency .",
    "the solution of the fokker - planck equation was given for an arbitrary periodic potential , and indicated also for the case in which the system switches randomly between two different potentials .",
    "considering a standard ratchet potential we have systematically investigated the behavior of the current as a function of the stability index of the lvy noise , the noise intensity and the ` on ' and ` off ' rates of the flashing mechanisms .",
    "the fokker - planck results for the current were checked by means of langevin calculations . we have found that random dichotomic flashing can produce a rich behaviour of the ratchet current .",
    "it allows both to enhance and diminish appreciably the static lvy ratchet current depending on the magnitude and relative magnitude of the flashing frequencies , and on the lvy noise parameters . a general statement to remark is that for small enough noise intensity or large enough stability index , a flashing mechanism can enhance the current of the static ratchet .",
    "another relevant result indicates that , for a fixed flashing mechanism , the lvy noise gives larger current than the gaussian noise in almost any situation .",
