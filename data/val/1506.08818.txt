    "since its discovery in 1930 @xcite the dwarf planet pluto has provided us with valuable information on the origin of the solar system , its structure , its dynamical evolution and its basic building blocks .",
    "it was the first object to be discovered in the kuiper belt and suggest its existence ; its orbital resonance with neptune and high inclination provided strong evidence for neptune migration @xcite , and thereby provided important clues into the early history of the solar system and its assemblage .",
    "the discovery of its close companion charon @xcite revealed the existence of a new type of planetary systems , binary planetesimals / dwarf - planets , and its close and tidally - locked configuration provided further clues for its collisional origin @xcite .",
    "a series of discoveries in recent years showed the existence of no - less than four additional satellites , including styx , nix , kerberos and hydra orbiting pluto on circular orbits with semi - major axes ranging between @xmath542k-65k km , i.e. residing between @xmath6 of the system hill radius , @xmath7 ; where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the semi - major axis ( sma ) of the orbit of pluto around the sun ; the orbital eccentricity ; and the mass of pluto , respectively ; @xmath11 is the mass of the sun ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these recent findings gave rise to a series of studies on the formation , stability and evolution of this extended system @xcite , that could shed light not only on the origin of the pluto system , but also provide new clues to the understanding of the growth of planetary system in general , as well as on migration and resonant capture processes in planetesimal disks .",
    "better understanding of the properties of the pluto system and its constituents is therefore invaluable for advancing our knowledge of the solar system , its building blocks and and its origins .",
    "the new - horizon mission , launched in 2006 , was designed to explore the pluto - charon system and help accomplish these goals @xcite .",
    "new horizon is now reaching its climax , as it makes its close flyby near the pluto - charon system , aiming to characterize pluto and its satellites at an unprecedented level , and potentially detect additional satellites and/or planetesimal rings in this system .",
    "understanding the dynamical history and the current configuration of the pluto satellite system system are therefore invaluable for realizing new - horizons data collecting and characterization potential , and use them in the interpretation of the data and their implications for the origins of pluto and the solar system history .    here",
    "we show that secular evolutionary processes due to gravitational perturbations by the sun , previously neglected , may have played a major role in the initial formation of the pluto system as well as in the later evolution of its satellite system and its configuration to this day .",
    "as we discuss below , our finding provide direct predictions for the possible orbits of outer moons in the pluto - charon system , if such exist .",
    "in particular we show that co - planar planetesimal rings can not exist beyond a specific critical separation from pluto - charon ( significantly smaller than the hill radius of the system ) , and that any moon residing beyond this critical separation must be an irregular , inclined and/or eccentric moon .",
    "moreover , we constrain the orbital phase space regimes ( semi - major axis , eccentricity , inclination ) in which dust , planetesimal - rings and/or outer moons can exist on dynamically and secularly stable orbits .",
    "charon is pluto s closest and largest moon , with semi - major axis of @xmath12 km ( period of @xmath13 days ) and mass @xmath14 g ( mass ratio of @xmath15 ) .",
    "it revolves around pluto on a tidally - locked ( i.e. in double synchronous state ) circular orbit with an inclination of @xmath16 in respect to the orbit of pluto around the sun ( which in itself is inclined in an angle of @xmath17 in respect to the ecliptic plane ) .",
    "together with the sun , the pluto - charon system comprises a hierarchical triple system , with pluto and charon orbiting each other in an inner binary orbit , and their center of mass orbiting the sun in an outer binary orbit .",
    "the evolution of such hierarchical gravitating triple systems may give rise to secular dynamical processes , in which the outer third body perturbs the orbit of the inner binary , leading to secular precession of the inner binary , typically exciting its eccentrcity . in particular , triples with high mutual inclinations between the inner and outer orbits",
    "( typically @xmath18 , and somewhat lower for eccentric systems ) are subject to quasi - periodic secular evolution , so called lidov - kozai ( lk ) cycles @xcite , which could affect pluto s satellites as well as other solar system binary planetesimals @xcite and satellites of the gas - giants @xcite . such lk evolution leads to the inner orbit precession and in turn gives rise to high amplitude eccentricity and inclination oscillations that occur on the lk precession timescales , which are much longer than the orbital period .    in principle",
    ", the high mutual inclination of the charon - pluto system makes it highly susceptible to such lk secular evolution , and in the absence of other forces it would have lead to a collision between pluto and charon",
    ". however , such processes are highy sensitive to any additional perturbations of the system precession .",
    "in particular , the effects of the tidal forces between pluto and charon at their current separation lead to a significant precession of their orbital periapse , which will be denoted @xmath19 .",
    "this , in turn , quenches any lk secular evolution , and keeps pluto and charon on a stable circular orbit , with no variations of the orbital eccentricity and the mutual inclination in respect to the orbit around the sun .",
    "the strong dependence of the tidal forces on the satellite separation renders the tidal effects on pluto s four other known satellites negligible .",
    "however , periapse precession can still be induced by the non  point - mass gravitational - potential of the inner pluto - charon binary @xcite , similar to the case of circumbinary planets @xcite . in this case , if the inner - binary induced precession timescale , @xmath20 , is shorter than the lk precession timescale , @xmath21 , the orbit will not librate and the lk secular evolution will be quenched . if , on the other hand , lk period is shorter than the precession timescale , the binary - induced precession is slow and the orbit has sufficient time to librate and build - up significant lk oscillations .",
    "the critical sma at which these timescales become comparable is given by ( fig . 1 ; see appendix for full derivation ) @xmath22^{1/5},\\label{eq : a_crit-1}\\ ] ] where parameters with sub - indexes pc correspond to the orbital parameters of the pluto - charon orbit , and the @xmath23 index refers to the orbital parameters of the orbiting moon . the inner orbit semi - major axis ( sma ) for pluto - charon mutual orbit is @xmath24 ; the sma of the moon orbit around pluto - charon is given by @xmath25 ; the eccentricity of the inner orbit , is @xmath26 the eccentricity of the outer orbit is @xmath27 ; the arguments of the pericenter of the inner and outer orbits are @xmath28 , respectively and @xmath29 is the cosine of the inclination between the two orbit planes denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "charon mass is given by @xmath31 and the mass of the sun is denoted by @xmath11 .                        in fig .",
    "[ fig : timescales ] we compare the satellite precession timescales due to the inner - binary induced precession with the precession timescales due to lk secular evolution .",
    "the opposite dependence of these two precession timescales on the orbital separation give rise to a critical separation at which they equalize , as derived in eq .",
    "[ eq : a_crit-1 ] . beyond the critical separation,@xmath3 ,",
    "at which the timescales become comparable , satellites / rings become highly susceptible to lk secular evolution .",
    "the effect of the inner binary can be combined with the full secular equations of motion of the quadruple system ( pluto - charon+outer satellite+the sun ) to derive the full orbital evolution of the outer satellite in time .",
    "we use such derivations to find the maximal inclination and eccentricities attained by an initially co - planar satellite orbiting pluto - charon on a circular orbit , as a function of the satellite initial separation from pluto ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kozai - examples ] ) . as can be seen , the lk precession timescale is longer than the binary - induced precession timescale for satellites at small separations , including the current locations of pluto satellites .",
    "lk - evolution induced eccentricity and inclination oscillations are completely quenched in these regions below @xmath3 , allowing for the stable orbits of the currently known satellites . however , beyond this point , lk oscillations are not ( or only partially ) quenched .",
    "satellites in these regions experience large amplitude eccentricity and inclination oscillations . in principle",
    ", satellites excited to high eccentricities might even cross the orbits of the inner satellites at peri - center approach or extend beyond the hill stable region at apocenter .",
    "the former case leads to strong interactions with the inner satellites ; such satellite will eventually destabilize the satellite system or collide with one of the inner moons .",
    "in the latter case the perturbations by the sun will destabilize the orbit of the moon , likely ejecting it from the system or sending into crossing orbits with the inner moons ( see examples in fig .",
    "[ fig : kozai - examples ] ) .",
    "regions in which such instabilities occur are therefore excluded regions where outer satellites can not survive ( fig .",
    "[ fig : regions ] ) .",
    "we can therefore exclude the existence of moons with some given orbital parameters @xmath32 if they do not follow the stability criteria @xmath33\\,\\,{\\rm { and}}\\,a[1+e_{max}(a , i , e)]<r_{hill}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the maximal eccentricity of the moon during an lk cycle ( which can be analytically or numerically derived from the coupled secular evolution equations of the orbital parameters ; including both binary precession and lk precession terms ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : the - maximal - eccentricity]and appendix ) .",
    "note that not far beyond the critical separation the lk timescale becomes much shorter than the binary - precession timescale , at which point the secular evolution is completely dominated by lk evolution , and the binary precession terms can be neglected , i.e. for such large separations one can use the analytic solution for @xmath35 during lk oscillations , @xmath36^{1/2}$ ] @xcite which is independent of the separation .",
    "this criterion therefore provides a robust map of the excluded and allowed orbital phase regions in which outer moons may exist in the pluto - charon system .",
    "moreover , the current stable configuration of the known inner satellite system can therefore be used to constrain the region where farther satellites can exist .    the maximal eccentricity attained by an outer moon as a function of its semi - major axis ( for satellites on initially co - planar circular orbits ) .",
    "the maximal eccentricity excited during the secular evolution depends on the the coupled effect of the perturbations by the sun ( lk evolution ) and the precession induced by the pluto - charon inner binary . in the inner regions lk evolution is quenched and the satellite keeps its initial eccentricity and inclination , at the outer regions binary precession become negligible and the maximal eccentricity is derived directly from the lk evolution . in the intermediate regimes both process are important and the maximal eccentricity can be derived numerically or be approximated analytically . ]    for initially circular co - planar moons with @xmath37 , @xmath38 and we get @xmath39 , i.e. such moons never evolve to hydra crossing orbits .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : regions ] showing that initially regular moons on co - planar circular orbits beyond @xmath40 evolve through lk cycles and can obtain high inclinations and eccentricities , but their trajectories never cross the orbits of the inner moons .",
    "such moons , even if they were initially formed on co - planar circular orbits ( `` regular '' moons ) can not sustain such orbits ; they secularly evolve , and if observed they are expected to be irregular moons , with non - negligible eccentricity and/or inclination in respect to the pluto - charon orbit .",
    "moreover , initially regular outer moons can exist only in a limited outer region beyond the critical separation , as satellites at even larger separations cross the hill stability radius .",
    "large regions of the orbital phase space are therefore excluded by these criteria for the existence of moons .",
    "our results therefore constrain the maximal extension where regular moons and planetesimal disks can exist around the pluto - charon system .",
    "we can therefore predict that any moons residing beyond the critical separation , if such exist , will be eccentric / inclined irregular moons , and we map the specific orbits allowed for such moons .",
    "these finding also show that secular lk evolution can _ not _ be neglected in studies of the formation and evolution of the pluto - charon system and its satellites , as hitherto ( tacitly ) assumed .",
