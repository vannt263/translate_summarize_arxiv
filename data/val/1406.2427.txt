    "it is well - known that deterministic classical systems with few degrees of freedom can exhibit complicated chaotic behaviour that is similar to behaviour of systems with intrinsic random fluctuations .",

    "each realization of the perturbation creates an unique trajectory of the system , therefore , efficient description of the system s response implies the usage of statistical analysis .",
    "nevertheless , single realizations of the random perturbation can be considered as deterministic functions . as long as the temporal fourier spectrum of the perturbation is broad",
    ", there is no way for survival of impenetrable stable domains in phase space @xcite .",
    "however , statistical analysis of the finite - time lyapunov exponents in randomly - driven systems shows that remarkable fraction of phase space area maintains stability on timescales which exceed significantly the so - called lyapunov time @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the global lyapunov exponent calculated with @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "such trajectories form bundles like branched flows in quantum point contacts @xcite , or coherent ray clusters in ocean acoustics @xcite .",
    "one should nt confuse this kind of coherent phenomena with the domains of particle clusterization in random fields @xcite .",
    "the main difference is the location of initial conditions for particles . in the case of the coherent clusters ,",
    "the initial conditions belong to continuous manifolds in phase space .",
    "location of that manifolds depends on particular realization of the perturbation .",
    "such manifolds can be found out in various ways .",
    "for example , one can calculate the map of finite - time lyapunov exponents in phase space @xcite , or compute eigenfunctions of the transfer operator @xcite .",
    "it turns out that system s behaviour under a single realization can significantly differ from the picture obtained via statistical averaging .",
    "there can occur phenomena which are typical for deterministic systems , for example , intermittency and capturing into dynamical traps @xcite .",
    "thus , one needs some general approach which can be used for both deterministic and noisy cases .",
    "the problem of interrelation between deterministic and statistical approaches also arises in quantum systems whose classical counterparts exhibit chaotic behaviour .",
    "periodic orbit theory @xcite provides classical interpretation of quantum spectra and , in addition , reveals some non - classical features , like scars of wavefunctions @xcite .",
    "one can suggest that some peculiarities of deterministic quantum systems should manifest themselves in quantum systems involving classical noise .",
    "the issue of particular interest is how deterministic phenomena associated with periodic orbits are revealed under stochastic driving , when there is no periodic orbits in the strict sense .    in the present paper , we demonstrate approach that allows one to analyze quantum systems under weak random perturbation in the framework of deterministic theory . in that approach , it is implied that system s behaviour possesses some features which are common for all typical realizations of the perturbation . in this way ,",
    "any realization is treated as a deterministic process with known spectral properties . on the classical level",
    ", our approach is based on the one - step poincar map originally introduced in @xcite .",
    "it serves as a tool for finding out phase space patterns repeating themselves after some time interval .",

    "we use this approach for a purely quantum problem , namely for the quantum nonlinear pendulum subjected to broadband perturbation .",
    "our main goal is to study how domains of finite - time stability influence quantum dynamics .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the condition of invariance under translation over finite time interval is too restrictive , and there can be phase space patterns which do nt satisfy it but correspond to non - chaotic dynamics .",
    "a striking example is the so - called branched flows in quantum point contacts @xcite .",
    "our approach is rather designed for oscillatory motion subjected to external noise . in particular , it can be implemented in the problems of noise - driven dissociation or ionization @xcite , where regular phase space domains prevent transitions into unbounded states , therefore , efficient destruction of these domains is of great importance .",

    "it corresponds to the periodic boundary conditions @xmath7 .",
    "this simplification is quite reasonable if we deal with semiclassical regime when energy bands are flat , and tunneling between neighbouring potential wells is fairly weak .",
    "it demands the planck constant to be small , therefore , we set @xmath8 .",

    "@xcite show that the destruction of invariant curves leads to the onset of directed current",
    ".    nevertheless , traces of eigenfunctions with good persistence to chaos are visible even for @xmath71 .",
    "for instance , there is a small slightly smeared horizontal stripe near @xmath72 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - munu](d ) ) corresponding to infinite motion with relatively high velocities .",
    "that phase space region is characterized by inequality @xmath73 that anticipates weak influence of resonances ( [ rescond ] ) , and , hence , weakness of chaos induced by their overlapping .",
    "as domains of finite - time stability in phase space give rise to fteo eigenfunctions with small @xmath65 , one can estimate their contribution using the cumulative distribution @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the corresponding probability density function .",
    "we refer to the case @xmath76 as the regime of strong localization .",
    "indeed , inequality @xmath76 implies that a fteo eigenfunction is mainly contributed from one or two unperturbed eigenstates .",
    "in addition , let s consider two regimes of moderate localization : @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the sense of the latter two criteria becomes apparent if we take into account that finite motion corresponds to the 25 lowest unperturbed eigenstates .",
    "thus , the inequality @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) picks out fteo eigenfunctions occupying less than 20 percents ( 40 percents ) of the phase space area enclosed by the unperturbed separatrix . as it follows from fig .",
    "[ fig - npc ] , fraction of strongly localized eigenfunctions rapidly decays down to nearly zero .",
    "it indicates the absence of significant long - living regular domains in classical phase space .",
    "it should be mentioned that the opposite situation was observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where slow decay of @xmath79 was linked to the presence of degenerate tori in phase space . in the present case there is no degenerate tori , therefore , there is no such route to the persistence of regular domains .",
    "fractions of moderately localized functions decay much slower , and their impact remains significant even at @xmath71 .",
    "it can be understood as manifestation of dynamical localization , i.  e. partial suppression of chaos - assisted diffusion due to the interference .",
    "in the present paper , we demonstrate approach designed for studying quantum manifestations of classical finite - time stability under weak external random perturbation . the approach is based on construction of the finite - time evolution operator ( fteo ) .",
    "it is emphasized that statistical properties of fteo eigenfunctions are closely linked to classical phase space structure revealed by one - step poincar map that can be regarded as the classical counterpart of the fteo . in particular , the stalagmite - like patterns on distributions of eigenfunctions in the space of parameters @xmath66 and @xmath65 are related to wavefunction concentrations near the periodic orbits of the one - step poincar map .",
    "increasing of time results in emergence of chaos , therefore , periodic orbits loss their stability .",

    "they occur owing to the same mechanism as stable islands in time - periodic systems .",
    "namely , they are remnants of nonlinear resonances of one - step poincare map and arise in somewhat regular and predictable way . to underline the latter circumstance , we present phase space portraits corresponding to different realizations , and one can see that regular domains appear in the same ranges of the action ( or energy ) values .",
