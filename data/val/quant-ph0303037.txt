    "the discovery by p. shor of an efficient algorithm to factorize integer numbers based on the laws of quantum mechanics @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , was a landmark event in quantum computing @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",

    "lenstra and h.w .",
    "lenstra @xcite requires @xmath6 $ ] steps , for some @xmath7 .",
    "this shows how powerful a quantum computer could be .",
    "this discovery fueled the theoretical and experimental search for practical realizations of such a `` machine of wonders '' ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "nonetheless , to build a quantum computer with the required power is a very challenging and still not accomplished task .",
    "this makes shor s algorithm a theoretically important work which , at present , can not be implemented if not for very small numbers @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is then of strong interest to explore _ semiclassical _ limits of shor s algorithm , and to see how much the related approximations affect the algorithm .",
    "some ideas along these lines are already present in the literature @xcite .",
    "there it is shown that the quantum fourier transform ( the core of the algorithm ) , could be simplified if one uses a macroscopic signal to control the quantum gates .",
    "we assume here that semiclassical devices should be easier to handle than quantum devices , a semiclassical device being ( in this context ) a physical system performing the computation , whose dynamics is partially governed by the laws of classical physics and partially by those of quantum mechanics .",
    "a cogent example is the system imagined in @xcite , where the macroscopic signal controlling the quantum gates is a pulse of several volts in a coaxial cable .",
    "it is easy to convince oneself that , on general grounds , it is a lot handier to deal with such a classical pulse than to deal with more `` fragile '' ( decohering ) quantum signals .",
    "the approach we take in this paper is fundamental and general , as we would like to give the mathematical prescriptions for implementing shor s algorithm on generic semiclassical devices .",
    "we shall make use of generalized coherent states , and tackle the difficult problem to find out what a semiclassical approximation is in this framework .",
    "our primary goal is to see if the semiclassical limit of shor s algorithm is still more powerful than the classical factoring algorithm .",
    "if it is , the task of constructing a semiclassical computer would be worth pursuing .",
    "the method we present here ( based on generalized coherent states @xmath8 of su(2 ) for spin @xmath9 ) is made of two parts :    first , we show that in the @xmath8 basis a symplectic structure arises .",
    "hence the physical system making the computation could , in principle , be described by a classical phase - space , and the computation itself as an evolution in this phase - space . in this",
    "setting , the quantum fluctuations are naturally dropped by mapping @xmath10 . a fully classical version of shor s algorithm",
    "would then be the one where all the quantum operators ( gates ) @xmath11 are replaced by their classical counterparts @xmath12 , and the quantum evolution replaced by a classical path over the phase - space .",
    "in particular this philosophy applies to the quantum fourier transform @xmath13 .",
    "a classical version of @xmath13 would be the one with the string of operators @xmath14s , and @xmath15s , entering the expression of @xmath13 , replaced by @xmath16s , and @xmath17s , respectively .",
    "we define to be _ semiclassical _ the approximation that replaces @xmath13 with @xmath18 .",
    "this is the second part of our recipe for semiclassicality in this framework .    in the next section",
    ", we shall introduce the notation and review the key ideas of shor s algorithm . in section iii",
    ", we shall explain the two parts of our coherent state semiclassical approximation : the classical time - evolution for the spin @xmath0 system making the computation ( subsection iii.a ) ; and the coherent state approximation of the quantum fourier transform ( subsection iii.b ) .",
    "eventually , in section iv we shall evaluate the effects of the semiclassical approximations on the success probability of shor s algorithm , and we shall perform some numerical tests and comment on them . the last section is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "given an @xmath2-bit integer number @xmath3 , the fastest way to factor it into relative co - primes @xmath19 is to find @xmath20 and @xmath21 such that @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , thus one can write @xmath24 where neither @xmath25 nor @xmath26 is zero @xmath27 .",
    "it is then matter of finding the greatest common divisors : @xmath28 , and @xmath29 to have two of the factors , and so on .",
    "this approach is used by both the best known classical and best known quantum algorithms for factoring .",
    "the quantum algorithm uses a further result of number theory : if one randomly picks an integer @xmath30 , and @xmath31 ( otherwise we would have been so lucky to have already found a factor of @xmath3 ) , then the period @xmath32 of the function @xmath33 determines the factors of @xmath3 , provided @xmath32 is even and @xmath34 .",
    "this can be easily seen from the fact that @xmath35 implies @xmath36 and , for @xmath32 even , both sides are squares .",
    "thus , since @xmath37 , one can proceed as in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , and compute @xmath38 .",
    "this procedure , on which the shor s method to determine @xmath32 `` quickly '' is based , would take a polynomial time on a computer that makes use of the laws of quantum mechanics .",
    "let us now introduce a mathematical and physical framework to describe a quantum computer , give some of the details of shor s algorithm , and introduce our notation .",
    "as any quantum system , a quantum computer is described by a hilbert space @xcite , and its logic is implemented by operators ( quantum gates ) acting on this hilbert space . in the usual model",
    "one considers the hilbert spaces that are tensor products of two - state systems or quantum bits . in the spin-@xmath0 representation of a quantum bit ,",
    "a spin state with @xmath39 ( spin down ) represents the binary digit zero , and a spin state with @xmath40 ( spin up ) represents the binary digit one .",
    "these states form a basis of the two - level hilbert space @xmath41 , and are usually represented as @xmath42 for spin down , and @xmath43 for spin up , depending on the notation . the notation ( i )",
    "will be used only in section iii.a to make the role of the spin @xmath44 explicit .",
    "the full hilbert space used to represent a @xmath2-bit number is then @xmath45 clearly such two - level systems can be physically realized in many other ways , see for instance @xcite . however , in all cases , the algebraic structure of importance can be represented by such a tensor product space .",
    "the spin states above form a representation of the lie algebra su(2 ) of angular momentum .",
    "as is well known , this lie algebra has three generators @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , and one can introduce the step - up , @xmath49 , and step - down , @xmath50 , generators to write the defining commutation relations of su(2 ) as @xmath51 = 2 \\hbar j_0 \\ ; , \\quad [ j_0 , j_{\\pm } ] = \\pm \\hbar j_{\\pm }    \\;,\\ ] ] also known as the cartan - weyl form of the lie algebra . in the next section",
    "we shall present a semiclassical version of this quantum system .",
    "we now want to briefly summarize shor s quantum factoring algorithm .",
    "we start with the definition of the quantum fourier transform ( qft ) acting on a state @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "this is the quantum representative of the @xmath2-bit number @xmath54 , @xmath55 , hence @xmath56 .",
    "note the order of the entries in eq .",
    "( [ order ] ) .    the qft acts by replacing @xmath57 by @xmath58 where , as for @xmath57 , @xmath59 is the quantum representative of the @xmath2-bit number @xmath60 , @xmath61 @xmath53 .",
    "this is achieved by acting on @xmath57 with the string of @xmath62 operators in the given order @xmath63 where the operators @xmath14 act on the @xmath64 two - states hilbert space @xmath65 , and the operators @xmath15 , @xmath66 , act on tensor products of two - states hilbert spaces @xmath67 .",
    "while the expression for @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) is independent on the notation , the operators @xmath14 can be expressed as @xmath68 \\;,\\ ] ] in notation ( i ) , or @xmath69 in notation ( ii ) , and the operators @xmath15 are given by @xmath70 \\;,\\ ] ] in notation ( i ) , or @xmath71 in notation ( ii ) , where @xmath72 .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the string of operators in @xmath13 generates the required state ( [ 19 ] ) only after the bits representing the output have been reversed . since",
    "this can be done in polynomial time , we omit this step except where the analysis requires more care .",
    "the state one starts from for the implementation of shor s procedure is simply @xmath73 .",
    "thus one first obtains @xmath74 by acting with @xmath13 on the first register .",
    "then the modular exponentiation on the second register gives the state @xmath75 where @xmath3 is the number to be factored .",
    "it is now matter of applying again the qft @xmath13 to the first register in @xmath76 to obtain @xmath77    the probability of observing @xmath78 , and @xmath79 is easily computed as @xmath80 the probability ( [ 24 ] ) is thus a function of the period @xmath32 of @xmath81 which we want to determine . hence measuring @xmath78 , and @xmath79 turns into a way of determining @xmath32",
    "this is seen by noticing that @xmath82 means @xmath83 for some integer @xmath84 , hence @xmath85 }    \\exp \\ { 2 \\pi i f \\frac{\\{l \\hat{c}\\}_q}{q}\\}\\right|^2 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath86 $ ] is the integer part of @xmath87 , and @xmath88 for some integer @xmath89 .",
    "one also would like to maximize this probability by choosing the phases in the sum ( [ prob ] ) to point as close as possible to the same direction in the complex plane .",
    "this is achieved in @xcite by requiring @xmath90 or , equivalently , ( using the definition of @xmath91 ) @xmath92 when this condition is satisfied , for large @xmath93s the sum in ( [ prob ] ) can be approximated to order @xmath94 by the integral @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "this integral is minimized when @xmath97 , giving the lower bound @xmath98 for the probability ( [ prob ] ) : @xmath99 in fig .",
    "1 we plot @xmath100 against @xmath78 for @xmath101 , @xmath102 . by inspection of ( [ 25a ] )",
    "one immediately sees that @xmath32 was found : @xmath78 was measured , @xmath93 is known , and @xmath103 is the best rational representation of the real number @xmath104 , and can be determined by using a continuous fraction expansion .",
    "there are two leading contributions to the complexity of this algorithm :    \\i ) the modular exponentiation .",
    "this part of the algorithm could be implemented classically ( it is not known a quantum way to speed it up ) , and the complexity of this procedure is known to be @xmath105 .",
    "\\ii ) the qft @xmath13 . by counting how many operators enter the expression ( [ 20 ] ) of @xmath13",
    ", we notice that this part of the algorithm involves @xmath106 steps .",
    "one thus conclude that the overall complexity is @xmath107 .",
    "to present our semiclassical approximation , we want now to exploit the semiclassical nature of the coherent states associated with the lie algebra su(2 ) .",
    "first we shall construct the classical phase - space associated with the lie algebra of the angular momentum ( [ 100 ] ) .",
    "then we shall introduce our coherent states approximation of shor s algorithm , with special emphasis on the qft @xmath13 .",
    "mathematically a classical representation of the lie algebra su(2 ) corresponds to determine the associated phase - space , with its symplectic structure , such that _ commutators _ of the lie algebra are realized as _",
    "poisson brackets _ of appropriate functions derived in this phase - space .",
    "the procedure for doing so is well known , and is based on generalized coherent states @xcite .",
    "let us briefly summarize it .",
    "we start by defining an unnormalized coherent state @xmath108 where @xmath109 is a complex number , we use the basis ( i ) in ( [ notation ] ) , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and the angular momentum operators @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 are dimensionless .",
    "this last point is of some importance since we are going to introduce _ dimensionless _ poisson brackets , whereas the standard poisson brackets have dimension @xmath115^{-1}$ ] .",
    "thus we shall eventually end up with a symplectic structure for the dimensionless operators @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 . in the coherent state representation",
    "these operators , suitably normalized , are the complex functions @xmath119 they have the general property that @xmath120 in our case , @xmath121 .",
    "hence the vector @xmath122 has length @xmath9 , and represents a point on the surface of the sphere @xmath123 of radius @xmath0 . on this",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "the first part of our semiclassical description is to represent the su(2 ) algebra of quantum angular momentum in the coherent state functional form ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "this causes : i ) the quantum fluctuations in the angular momentum to be automatically dropped via @xmath10 , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ jj ] ) above ; and ii ) a symplectic structure over the space of the stereographic coordinates on the sphere naturally to arise . to see how point ii )",
    "is achieved we introduce the khler potential @xcite , @xmath124 on the phase - space defined by the complex variables @xmath109 , and @xmath125 @xmath126 where @xmath127 and of course @xmath128 .",
    "the poisson brackets of any two functions on the @xmath109 , @xmath129 phase - space and @xmath129 , from the definition ( [ 5 ] ) it is clear that , if , for instance , we choose @xmath109 as the generalized coordinate , its conjugate momentum is @xmath130 , so that @xmath131 . for the other choice , @xmath125 is the generalized coordinate , and its conjugate momentum is @xmath132 .",
    "] , @xmath133 , @xmath134 can then be defined as @xmath135 leading to the following poisson brackets of @xmath136 @xmath137 this is the lie algebra su(2 ) we started from , but in a dimensionless semiclassical form .",
    "this establishes the fact that the phase - space corresponding to su(2 ) is @xmath123 with stereographic coordinates @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 .",
    "we can move further to define the hamiltonian @xmath141 associated with the symplectic form @xmath142 . to this end",
    ", we introduce a vector field @xmath143 that keeps @xmath142 invariant @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the lie derivative associated with the vector field @xmath146 @xcite . by computing the lie derivative one obtains the following conditions for the vector field @xmath147 , and @xmath148 , with @xmath149 a complex constant .",
    "one can also write the lie derivative as @xmath150 , where the exterior derivative @xmath89 and the internal product ( or contraction ) @xmath151 act on @xmath152-forms @xmath153 as @xmath154 , and @xmath155 , respectively . to be more explicit",
    "let us write a @xmath152-form in local coordinates on a symplectic manifold @xmath156 of even dimension @xmath157 @xmath158 where @xmath159 is a totally antisymmetric tensor field , and @xmath160 are the local coordinates on the @xmath161 dimensional symplectic manifold @xmath156 .",
    "thus @xmath162 while @xmath163 where @xmath164 , and @xmath165 means that @xmath166 is missing .    in our case",
    "@xmath142 is a symplectic two - form , hence it is closed , @xmath167 .",
    "then , @xmath168 implies that @xmath169 . according to the lemma of poincar it follows that locally the one - form @xmath170 is equal to @xmath89 acting on a function ( a zero - form ) which we call @xmath171 @xmath172 if @xmath141 can also be globally defined , then it can be taken as the hamiltonian corresponding to the vector field @xmath146 .    by using the definition ( [ 11 ] ) , and the above given conditions for the vector field to leave @xmath142 invariant ( with @xmath173 ) we obtain @xmath174 which gives @xmath175 as a possible classical hamiltonian .",
    "once @xmath141 is chosen it determines the dynamics in the phase - space , generating the `` time - evolution '' of any function @xmath176 as @xmath177 it is straightforward to check that @xmath178 , where @xmath179 .",
    "hence the dimensionless time parameter of the semiclassical evolution is @xmath180 .    by noticing that @xmath181 , and using ( [ 7 ] ) one has @xmath182 thus , in the semiclassical limit",
    ", the quantum spin system we started out with has been replaced by coordinates on @xmath183 , with the associated symplectic form . a hamiltonian consistent with this symplectic form",
    "can be introduced .",
    "that leads to uniformly precessing coordinates @xmath138 , and @xmath184 , always preserving the length of the vector .",
    "this is a classical spinning vector .",
    "note also that @xmath185 the first step towards our attempt to construct a semiclassical version of shor s algorithm is now complete .",
    "the key observation is that @xmath109 can be interpreted as a variable that describes a classical spinning particle .",
    "we now move to the second stage of the semiclassical approximation .",
    "the steps of the quantum procedure we propose to modify are the ones involving the qft which consists in the following replacement @xmath186 with @xmath187 .",
    "we want to write ( [ 26 ] ) in the basis of _ normalized _ coherent states @xmath188 @xmath189 this can be done as follows @xmath190 where the measure is defined by requiring @xmath191 ^ 2}{(1+\\lambda _ i\\bar{\\lambda}_i)^2 }   = \\prod_{i=0}^{l-1 } \\frac{2}{\\pi } \\int_0^{2 \\pi } d \\phi_i   \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{r_i d r_i}{(1 + r_i^2)^2 } \\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath192 , and @xmath193 here no approximation has been made yet .",
    "this is a simple change of basis that , of course , preserves all the information content of @xmath194 .",
    "the approximation we now make in eq . (",

    "in appendix a it is proved that , for any matrix @xmath197 , @xmath198 preserves all the information .",
    "it is important to stress that , although no _ quantum _ information is lost by considering the @xmath198s , these functions are now described in terms of a set of variables that have a _ classical _ interpretation . using the technique described in detail in appendix a ,",

    "one could go further and approximate @xmath202 with the appropriate product of @xmath210s and @xmath211s as @xmath212 if one does so , powers of @xmath213 and @xmath214 higher than 0 and 1 would be obtained .",
    "thus one loses the matching between the dimension of the original hilbert space and the dimension of the space of parameters .",

    "for instance , the plots for @xmath101 could be regarded as the actual spotting of the periods @xmath102 , and @xmath273 for the factorization of @xmath274 ( taking @xmath275 ) , and @xmath276 ( taking @xmath277 ) , respectively . to appreciate the @xmath278 dependence",
    "3 , 4 , and 5 .    from our plots , see for instance figs . 3 , 6 , and 7 ,",
    "we also see , for @xmath279 , @xmath280 this confirms , from yet another perspective , that the values where @xmath264 has a maximum are not too widely spread around the corresponding shor s values .",
    "the last question left to answer concerns the behaviour of the success probability @xmath264 for large @xmath2 .",
    "two things are important : i ) the ratio @xmath281 ; ii ) the ratio @xmath282 .",
    "the first tells us how smaller than shor s the semiclassical probabilities get , and it is easy to compute @xmath283 for large @xmath2 the magnitude of the semiclassical probabilities exponentially falls off .",
    "the second ratio is independent from @xmath2 and , as proved in the earlier discussion , nearly as big as shor s @xmath284 this seems to us quite encouraging , as we might conclude that , despite the fact that the actual value of the semiclassical probability @xmath264 scales exponentially with @xmath2 , the semiclassical `` signal - to - noise '' ratio @xmath285 is nearly as good as the quantum one .    in appendix",
    "b we present an alternative method to study the scaling properties of @xmath264 .",
    "we have invented a semiclassical version of shor s quantum factoring algorithm based on su(2 ) generalized coherent states , and we have investigated its impact on the algorithm s efficiency .",
    "the coherent states @xmath8 for the spin-@xmath0 systems are the superpositions @xmath286 , where the complex variables @xmath109 have a classical interpretation . under this interpretation , a classical phase - space for @xmath109",
    "can be constructed by a well known procedure .",
    "this clarifies in which sense the quantum evolution , necessary for the implementation of the algorithm , could be , in principle , mimicked in a classical fashion .",
    "we expressed the quantum fourier transform ( the essential part of shor s algorithm ) by a coherent state diagonal representation , where the variables introduced have the aforementioned classical interpretation , although the operation itself is still quantum .",
    "this representation does not lead to a loss of information .",
    "it is only after integration over the classical variables that some information is lost , and an approximation is made .",
    "our analytic and numerical results show that this semiclassical step is very effective at spotting the required periodicity : despite the fact that the actual value of the semiclassical success probability decreases exponentially with @xmath2 , the semiclassical `` signal - to - noise '' ratio is nearly as good as shor s . in other words ,",
    "our semiclassical procedure preserves most of the power of the quantum algorithm .",
    "finally , with the above results in hand , we are confident that future searches along this line , for the implementation of shor s factoring algorithm on semiclassical devices , could lead to important new discoveries .    we acknowledge the positive criticism of the referees .",

    "this feature is due to the fact that @xmath109 is a complex number , hence the dimension of the space of parameters is equal to the dimension of the original hilbert space @xmath299 .",
    "furthermore , there is a one - to - one correspondence with the binary numbers and the powers of @xmath300 , with @xmath301 .",
