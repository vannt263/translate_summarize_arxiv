    "quantum information - processing systems display many features which are unknown in the classical world .",
    "well - known examples include teleportation @xcite , superdense coding @xcite and the ability to support novel cryptographic and computational protocols @xcite .",
    "central to many of these applications is the existence of entanglement between a _",
    "pair _ of distant quantum systems @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the case of teleportation , the establishment of a maximally entangled state of two distant qubits allows an arbitrary unknown 1-qubit state to be conveyed from one distant party to another with perfect fidelity .",
    "the consequences of _ multiparticle _ entanglement involving several distant parties have not yet been explored as extensively .",
    "an early application was the use of greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states to provide inequality - free tests of quantum mechanics versus local hidden - variable theories @xcite .",
    "more recently , multiparticle correlations have been shown to decrease the communication complexity of certain multiparty calculations ( i.e. , to reduce the amount of communication needed to realize a computation involving data from several distant parties ) @xcite .",
    "recent developments also include state purification protocols for multiparticle systems @xcite , schemes for basic manipulation of multiparticle states via entanglement swapping @xcite , and quantum secret sharing @xcite .",
    "another important application of multiparticle entanglement is in distributed quantum computing @xcite , where several distant parties ( alice , bob , claire , etc . ) share an initial entangled state , and are asked to perform a given computational task using only local operations and classical communication .",
    "the problem is to find a protocol that completes the task using the least possible resources ( in particular , the minimum amount of initial nonlocal entanglement , which is an ` expensive ' resource ) .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate this problem for the following scenario : alice holds an unknown 1-qubit quantum state @xmath1 and wishes to transmit identical copies of it to @xmath0 associates ( bob , claire , etc . ) .",
    "of course , the quantum no - cloning theorem @xcite implies that these copies can not be _",
    "perfect_. the best alice can do is to send _ optimal quantum clones _ of her state ( the most faithful copies allowed by quantum mechanics @xcite ; see also section [ sec : uqcm ] ) , which we assume are sufficient for her purposes .",
    "the computational task alice must perform is therefore to generate @xmath0 optimal quantum clones of a 1-qubit input and distribute them among distant parties .",
    "the most straightforward protocol available to alice would be to generate the optimal clones locally using an appropriate quantum network @xcite and then teleport each one to its recipient by means of previously shared maximally entangled pairs .",
    "this would require @xmath0 units of initial entanglement ( e - bits ) , as well as the sending of @xmath0 independent 2-bit classical messages ( one for each measurement result ) .",
    "it would also require alice to run a computationally expensive local network involving several extra qubits and 2-qubit operations .",
    "in contrast , as we shall see ahead , far cheaper strategies can be found ( requiring only @xmath2 e - bits ) , provided alice and her associates share particular multiparticle entangled states . in this case , it is possible to simultaneously convey all @xmath0 copies by means of a _ single _ measurement on alice s qubit .",
    "alice only needs to publicly broadcast the @xmath3 bits which determine her measurement result , after which each recipient performs an appropriate local rotation conditioned on this information .",
    "this ` telecloning ' is reminiscent of the well - known teleportation protocol of bennett _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "indeed , it can be seen as the natural generalization of teleportation to the many - recipient case .    at this point",
    ", we should note that a similar proposal for telecloning @xmath4 copies has been put forward by bru _",
    "et al _ @xcite . in their case",
    ", however , the procedure was not directly scalable to @xmath5 . moreover , the protocol was somewhat awkward , involving the deliberate discarding of information .",
    "our scheme avoids both drawbacks , generating any number of copies and involving only classical communication , local unitary rotations and one local measurement .",
    "our work is organized as follows : in section [ sec : pre ] we give a summary of relevant results concerning teleportation and optimal universal quantum cloning . in section [ sec : tc ]",
    "we present our telecloning protocol ; section [ sec : ent ] is devoted to analyzing the entanglement properties of the multiparticle telecloning states .",
    "open questions raised by our study are discussed in section [ sec : open ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : summary ] we present our conclusions .",
    "the teleportation protocol @xcite allows an unknown state @xmath6 of a quantum system @xmath7 to be faithfully transmitted between two spatially separated parties ( alice and bob ) .",
    "the essential steps of this procedure ( say in the simplest case where @xmath7 is a 1-qubit system ) are as follows : first and foremost , alice and bob must share a maximally entangled state of two qubits a and b , such as @xmath8 .",
    "next , alice performs a joint measurement of the 2-qubit system @xmath9 in the bell basis : @xmath10 finally , alice sends a two - bit message to bob informing him of her measurement result .",
    "bob then rotates his qubit using one of the unitary operators * 1 * , @xmath11 , @xmath12 or @xmath13 , according to whether alice s result was respectively @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "the final state of bob s qubit is then equal to the original state @xmath18 , regardless of the measurement result .",
    "this insensitivity to measurement results is the crucial property of the teleportation protocol , and one which we shall also require for our telecloning scheme .",
    "while teleportation aims to _ transmit _ quantum information faithfully , optimal cloning seeks to _ spread _ it among several parties in the most efficient way possible .",
    "the ` no - cloning ' theorem @xcite prevents this spreading from being perfect ; nevertheless , it is still reasonable to ask _ how accurately _ can such copies be made @xcite .",
    "if the quality of the copies ( measured , for instance , by their fidelity with respect to the original state @xmath19 ) is chosen to be independent of @xmath19 , then the answer is given by the so - called @xmath20 universal quantum cloning machines ( uqcms ) @xcite .",
    "these ` machines ' are unitary transformations that transform @xmath21 input systems which are identically prepared in state @xmath19 onto @xmath0 output systems @xmath22 , each of which ends up in a mixed state described by the reduced density operator @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 is a state orthogonal to @xmath19 ) @xcite .",
    "the fidelity factor @xmath25 of these imperfect copies has a definite upper limit imposed by quantum mechanics . in the case where each input system consists of one qubit",
    ", this optimal value is given by @xcite : @xmath26 unitary transformations which realize this bound have also been found @xcite . in general , they involve the @xmath21 ` original ' qubits , @xmath27 ` blank paper ' qubits ( initially prepared in some fixed state @xmath28 ) , and an ancilla system @xmath29 containing at least @xmath30 levels ( also initially in some fixed state @xmath31 ) . in this paper , we shall be mainly interested in the situation where only one original qubit is available , that is , @xmath32 . in this case , the cloning transformation @xmath33 is defined as follows : for an initial state @xmath34 , we have @xmath35 where @xmath36 and where c denotes the @xmath0 qubits holding the copies . here ,",
    "@xmath37 are @xmath0 orthogonal normalized states of the ancilla and @xmath38 denotes the symmetric and normalized state of @xmath0 qubits where @xmath39 of them are in state @xmath40 and @xmath41 are in the orthogonal state @xmath42 . for example , for @xmath43 : @xmath44    we note that , even though the minimum number of ancilla qubits required to support the @xmath0 levels @xmath37 is of the order of @xmath45 , these can be more conveniently represented as the symmetrized states of @xmath46 qubits @xcite : @xmath47 in this form , states @xmath48 and @xmath49 above become @xmath50-qubit states , obeying the following simple symmetries :    = 6.00truein    2 @xmath51 in other words , the states @xmath52 transform under simultaneous action of the pauli operators on all @xmath50 qubits just as a single qubit transforms under the corresponding single pauli operator .",
    "we also note that these operations are strictly local , that is , factorized into a product of independent rotations on each qubit .",
    "as we will see in the next section , these local symmetries play a crucial role , allowing cloning to be realized remotely via multiparticle entanglement .",
    "in this section , we present a ` telecloning ' scheme that combines cloning and teleportation .",
    "this is accomplished as follows : alice holds an ( unknown ) 1-qubit state @xmath18 which she wishes to teleclone to m associates bob , claire , etc .",
    "we assume that they all share a multiparticle entangled state @xmath53 as a starting resource .",
    "this state must be chosen so that , after alice performs a local measurement and informs the other parties of its result , the latter can each obtain an optimal copy given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : shrinking ] ) using only local rotations .",
    "a choice of @xmath53 with these properties is the following @xmath54-qubit state : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the optimal cloning states given by eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : oqcstate0 ] ) and ( [ eqn : oqcstate1 ] ) . here , @xmath58 denotes the @xmath0 qubits which shall hold the copies , each of which is held by one of alice s associates . for convenience",
    ", we shall refer to them collectively as ` the receivers ' ( though it should be kept in mind that they may all be far away from each other ) .",
    "@xmath59 represents a single qubit held by alice , which we shall refer to as the ` port ' qubit .",
    "finally , @xmath29 denotes an @xmath60 qubit ancilla , which for convenience we will also assume to be on alice s side ( even though , once again , each qubit may in reality be at a different location ) .",
    "the tensor product of @xmath53 with the unknown state @xmath61 held by alice is a @xmath62-qubit state . rewriting it in a form that singles out the bell basis of qubits @xmath7 and @xmath59",
    ", we get @xmath63 the telecloning of @xmath6 can now be accomplished by the following simple procedure :    1 .   alice performs a bell measurement of qubits @xmath7 and @xmath59 , obtaining one of the four results @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "if the result is @xmath66 , then subsystem @xmath67 is projected precisely into the optimal cloning state given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn:1mclon ] ) . in this case ,",
    "our task is accomplished .",
    "2 .   in case one of the other bell states",
    "is obtained , we can still recover the correct state of ac by exploiting the symmetries of states @xmath68 and @xmath69 under the pauli matrix operations ( eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : symm1]-[eqn : symm3 ] ) ) .",
    "specifically , if @xmath70 is obtained , we must perform @xmath11 on each of the @xmath71 qubits in ac ; similarly , if @xmath72 or @xmath73 are obtained , they must all be rotated by @xmath12 and @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "this procedure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : tctwo ] for the case of @xmath4 copies .",
    "we stress that , apart from alice s bell measurement , only local 1-qubit operations are required in this telecloning procedure . in this way ,",
    "all of the qubits except the input @xmath7 and the port @xmath59 can be spatially separated from each other .",
    "it is also worthwhile to add that rotating the ancilla qubits in step ( 2 ) above is not strictly necessary .",
    "the correct copy states of each output ( given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : shrinking ] ) ) are obtained at the output regardless of these operations , since local rotations on one qubit can not affect another qubit s reduced density operator .",
    "we thus see that , given the telecloning state ( [ eqn : tcstate ] ) and using only local operations and classical communication , we are able to optimally transfer information from one to several qubits . in the following section , we study in detail the entanglement properties of this state that allow this to happen .",
    "the procedure we have described in the previous section performs the same task as a unitary @xmath75 cloning machine , but uses only local operations and classical communication . in the former case ,",
    "information about the input state is conveyed to the output copies by means of global entangling operations ( this is explicitly shown in the cloning network of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in telecloning",
    ", the same transfer is realized through the multiparticle entanglement of state ( [ eqn : tcstate ] ) . in this section",
    ", we investigate the structure of this entanglement .",
    "it is important to remark that at present there is no known way of uniquely quantifying the entanglement of a general multiparticle state @xcite . for the purpose of understanding the flow of information in the telecloning procedure ,",
    "we find it convenient to perform this analysis from two points of view , which we refer to as the ` total ' and ` two - qubit ' pictures .",
    "the first of these involves all @xmath54 particles ( hence ` total ' ) , and refers to the entanglement between the @xmath0 qubits on alice s side ( the port and ancilla ) and the @xmath0 on the receivers side ( the outputs ) ; the second considers the entanglement of a single pair of qubits after tracing over all other qubits .",
    "let us first consider the ` total ' picture .",
    "we begin by rewriting the telecloning state ( [ eqn : tcstate ] ) so that the qubits on alice s and the receivers sides are explicitly separated :    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    @xmath76    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    2 this form highlights the high degree of symmetry of the telecloning state : it is completely symmetric under the permutation of any two particles on the same side , and also under the exchange of both sides .",
    "this implies that , in fact , any of the @xmath54 qubits can be used as the telecloning port , with the clones being created on the opposite side .",
    "another implication is that , instead of using all @xmath77 levels of the @xmath0 qubits on each side , we only need to take into account their @xmath78 symmetric states .",
    "these can be associated with the states of an @xmath78-level particle as follows : @xmath79 ( we note that this property arises from the choice of symmetric ancilla states in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ancilla ] ) ) . noting the exchange symmetry of both sides of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tc ] ) , the telecloning state ( [ eqn : tc ] ) can then be conveniently rewritten as the following _ maximally entangled _ state of two @xmath78-level particles @xcite @xmath80 the corresponding amount of entanglement , given by the von neumann entropy of each side s reduced density operator , is @xmath81 .",
    "we now show that this is in fact the _ minimum _ amount necessary for any telecloning scheme based on the cloning transformation defined by eq .",
    "( [ eqn:1mclon ] ) . to see this ,",
    "suppose the input qubit @xmath7 is already maximally entangled with another qubit @xmath82 @xmath83 then the linearity of transformation ( [ eqn:1mclon ] ) implies that the output of the cloning procedure must be @xmath84 which is precisely our telecloning state @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , a telecloning scheme where @xmath85 and @xmath58 are spatially separated allows the creation of at least @xmath86 e - bits , between two distant parties .",
    "we know however that entanglement can not be increased only by local operations and classical communication @xcite .",
    "we must conclude then that any telecloning scheme based on eq .",
    "( [ eqn:1mclon ] ) requires at least @xmath86 e - bits between these parties as an initial resource .",
    "the scheme we have described above is therefore optimal in this sense .",
    "in contrast , if alice used a local unitary network to obtain @xmath0 clones , and then teleported each one separately to its recipient , the amount of entanglement required would be @xmath0 e - bits .",
    "thus , telecloning realizes the same task with an much more efficient use of entanglement .",
    "if we also consider , as noted above , that the telecloning state allows any of the @xmath54 qubits to function as a port , then the increase in efficiency is even greater ( in order to allow the same freedom of choice in the ` clone then teleport ' protocol , @xmath87 singlets would be necessary ) . of course , in the case where only one ` clone ' is produced ( @xmath88 ) , the telecloning state is just a maximally entangled state of two 2-level systems ( in other words a bell state ) . in this case",
    ", our scheme reduces to the usual teleportation protocol .",
    "while entanglement between the two sides gives a measure of the resources necessary to accomplish telecloning , the ` two - qubit ' entanglement between an arbitrary pair of particles helps track how information from alice s unknown state is conveyed to the clones . to see this , we first calculate the reduced density matrix of each pair of qubits . due to the symmetries of the telecloning state , there are only two different classes of pairs : those where both qubits are on opposite sides ( alice s and the receivers ) and those where they are on the same side .    in the first case , the reduced joint density matrix of the two qubits in the @xmath89 basis is @xmath90 the peres - horodecki theorem @xcite provides us with a simple algorithm for determining whether or not a general two - qubit state is entangled .",
    "all that is necessary is to calculate the eigenvalues of the partial transpose of the state s density matrix . according to the theorem ,",
    "a state is entangled if and only if at least one of these eigenvalues is negative .",
    "the partial transpose of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : rdpc ] ) is @xmath91 the smallest eigenvalue of this matrix is @xmath92 , so that state @xmath93 is always entangled for all @xmath0 .",
    "thus , any pair of qubits on opposite sides of the telecloning state ( in particular , the ones used as port and outputs ) will be entangled , and by the same amount . on the other hand ,",
    "the reduced density matrix for two qubits which are both on the same side is @xmath94 this reduced density matrix is independent of @xmath0 , and the minimum eigenvalue of its partial transpose is @xmath95 .",
    "thus , any two qubits on the same side of the telecloning state are disentangled . however , their von neumann mutual information @xmath96 is nonzero , which indicates that the copies on the receivers side are still classically correlated , although these correlations are weak .",
    "the particular structure of the telecloning state can be justified qualitatively in the following way : first of all , we certainly expect alice s port qubit to be entangled with the outputs , since without entanglement quantum information can not be sent using only a classical channel .",
    "in addition , since all clones should be equal , the state should be symmetric under permutations of the output qubits ; in particular , they should all be equally entangled with the port .",
    "furthermore , in order to optimize the transfer of information the entanglement of the receiving and transmitting sides should be as large as possible .",
    "since the clones are symmetrized , and therefore occupy only @xmath97 levels of their hilbert space , the schmidt decomposition then implies that the total ` two - side ' entanglement should be precisely that of two maximally entangled @xmath78-level particles .",
    "finally , since the ancilla states on alice s side may be freely chosen ( as long as they are orthogonal ) , it is natural to assume them to be symmetrized , so that both sides are invariant under permutation .    the calculations above also allow us to view the telecloning state as a ` network ' of entangled qubits , each of which is only connected to the @xmath0 ones on the opposite side ( so the total number of ` links ' is @xmath87 ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : tcthree ] ) .",
    "essentially , we may think of these 2-qubit connections as ` communication channels ' through which quantum information may travel ( in the same sense that bennett _",
    "_ referred to the bell state in the original teleportation scheme as an ` epr channel ' @xcite ) . in this sense , the multiparticle entanglement structure functions as a _ multiuser channel _ , allowing quantum information from alice s input state to be conveyed to all the output clones .",
    "this is emphasized by the fact that any qubit in the network can be used as a port for the transmission .",
    "our work leaves a number of open questions which we now briefly discuss .",
    "first of all , what is the most efficient way of generating the telecloning state ?",
    "in particular , we would like to find a way for alice and other users to create this state just by starting with @xmath98 singlets and operating only locally with the aid of classical communication .",
    "if alice prepares the state locally and then distributes the particles to other users these will in general travel through a noisy channel",
    ". then it would be important to find a purification scheme to distill a  good \" telecloning state .",
    "the second open question is whether our telecloning protocol is the most efficient one or if there exists a way to use even less entanglement .",
    "this might be possible if there exists a cloning transformation which produces the same reduced density matrix for the copies as in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : shrinking ] ) , ( [ eqn : gamma ] ) but with less entanglement between them and the ancilla .",
    "it is very important to try to save on entanglement as much as we can , because this is the resource that is hardest to manipulate and maintain in practice .",
    "a further task would be to generalize our scheme to telecloning of @xmath21 to @xmath0 particles .",
    "yet another generalization would be the telecloning of @xmath99-dimensional registers @xcite .",
    "we have presented a telecloning scheme which generalizes teleportation by combining it with optimal quantum cloning .",
    "this allows the optimal broadcasting of quantum information from one sender ( alice ) to @xmath0 spatially separated recipients , requiring only a single measurement by alice followed by classical communication and local 1-qubit rotations .",
    "our scheme works by exploiting the multiparticle entanglement structure of particular joint states of @xmath54 particles .",
    "this structure can be seen as a multiuser ` network ' connecting each qubit on alice s side to each on the receivers side , in such a way that any node can be used to broadcast quantum information to all those on the opposing side .",
    "the resulting state requires only @xmath86 e - bits of entanglement between the two sides , representing a much more efficient use of entanglement than the more straightforward approach where alice first clones her particle @xmath0 times and then uses @xmath0 singlets to transmit these states to the different receivers .    in closing , we note that our scheme can also be applied to the realization of a ` quantum secret sharing ' protocol as introduced recently in @xcite .",
    "this refers to the situation where alice wishes to teleport a 1-qubit state in such a way that it can only be reconstructed at the ` receiving ' end of the teleportation channel if two or more separate parties agree to collaborate . in our case , this is accomplished by leaving both the ancilla and output qubits on the receivers side .",
    "then alice s original state may be reconstructed if and only if all the output clones and ancilla qubits are brought together to the the same location and acted upon by the inverse of the cloning transformation @xmath33 given in eq .",
