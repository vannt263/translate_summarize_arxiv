    "secure communication over wireless fading channels becomes a critical issue due to the broadcast nature of wireless networks .",
    "traditionally , key - based cryptographic technologies  @xcite are used to secure the data transmission . however , the secrecy provided by cryptographic technologies is conditioned on the premise that the eavesdroppers have limited computational capability to decipher the message without the knowledge of secret keys .",
    "this premise becomes controversial with the rapid developments of computing devices . on the other hand ,",
    "physical layer security is an emerging research area that explores the possibility of achieving perfect - secrecy data transmission among legitimate network nodes , while possible malicious nodes eavesdropping the communication obtain zero information  @xcite . basically , the objective of physical layer security is to minimize the amount of confidential information that can be obtained by the illegitimate users according to their received signals . to achieve secure communications over wireless channels ,",
    "physical layer security explores time - varying properties of the fading channel , smartly designs the channel code , and processes the transmitted signals , instead of relying on encryption .",
    "the information - theoretic foundation of secret communication was laid by shannon in  @xcite .",
    "wyner s pioneering work introduced the wiretap channel model as a basic framework for physical layer security  @xcite , which was extended to broadcast channels with confidential messages described by csiszar and korner in  @xcite .",
    "these early works have led to a significant amount of recent research activities taking the fading characteristics of wireless channels into account .",
    "the basic system model of physical layer security over wireless channels is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] .",
    "most works in this area rely on the perfect knowledge of both the legitimate receiver s and eavesdropper s channels at the transmitter to enable secure encoding and advanced signaling",
    ". however , the assumption of perfect knowing channel state information ( csi ) is not realistic . in practical scenarios ,",
    "many reasons can cause imperfections in the csi at the communication nodes , such as the following ones :    * no feedback from the eavesdroppers . when the eavesdropper is a passive entity ,",
    "its csi or even location is very hard to be obtained at the legitimate transmitter .",
    "also , when the eavesdroppers are malicious users , they are not willing to provide their channel information to the legitimate party . * partial csi feedback from the receivers .",
    "the receivers sometimes can only provide partial csi feedback to the transmitter , e.g. , limited - rate feedback , channel direction feedback , and signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) feedback . * imperfect feedback links between the transmitter and receivers .",
    "when the feedback links are not error - free or delayless , noise component is added into the feedback information , or the csi obtained at the transmitter is an outdated version of the actual csi . * channel estimation errors at the receivers .",
    "since the estimation of fading channels generally is not error - free , the csi obtained at the receivers is not perfect .    over the past few years , increasing attention has been paid to the impact of the uncertainty in the csi on both legitimate receiver s and eavesdropper s channels .",
    "the remainder of this paper is devoted to surveying and reviewing the literature of physical layer security with imperfect csi in wireless communications .",
    "we aim to provide a high - level overview of the current research and development of the field .",
    "in addition , this survey focus on the physical layer security researches without using the secret key , despite that some physical layer security work , e.g. ,  @xcite , investigated the secure transmission with the key observable by the eavesdropper over wireless channels .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . for research from the information theoretic perspective , section  [ sec : it ] presents the main performance metrics of secure transmissions with imperfect csi .",
    "signal processing secrecy enhancements developed in the secure transmission design considering imperfect csi are reviewed in section  [ sec : sp ] .",
    "section  [ sec : largesc ] turns to the secrecy with channel uncertainty in large - scale decentralized wireless .",
    "the open problem and possible future research directions are described in section  [ sec : op ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conc ] concludes the paper .",
    "the performance limits of secure transmission systems with full csi are often characterized by the secrecy capacity .",
    "the secrecy capacity , @xmath0 , for degraded wiretap channel with additive gaussian noise was given by  @xcite , @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the shannon capacities of main ( legitimate receiver s ) and eavesdropper s channels , respectively .",
    "a positive secrecy capacity can be obtained only when the legitimate receiver s channel is better than the eavesdropper s channel . when considering fading channels , main and eavesdropper s channels for a specific fading realization can be regarded as complex additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channels .",
    "the shannon capacities of one realization of the quasi - static fading channels are given by @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the instantaneous snrs at the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper , respectively .",
    "the instantaneous snr at the legitimate receiver is equal to @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the transmit power , @xmath10 denotes the instantaneous channel gain at the legitimate receiver , and @xmath11 denotes the receiver noise variance at the legitimate receiver . also , the instantaneous snr at the eavesdropper is equal to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the instantaneous channel gain at the eavesdropper and @xmath14 denotes the receiver noise variance at the eavesdropper .",
    "thus , the secrecy capacity for one realization of the quasi - static fading channels can be written as    [ eq : cs_one ] c_s=    _ 2(1+_m)-_2(1+_e ) , _",
    "m>_e , + 0 ,     note that in order to achieve the secrecy capacity in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cs_one ] ) , the transmitter needs perfect knowledge of both @xmath6 and @xmath7 .    to measure the performance of secure transmissions over fading channels with imperfect csi , ergodic secrecy capacity and outage - based characterizations",
    "are often adopted . in",
    "what follows , focusing on these two kinds of characterizations , we provide a review on the information theoretic aspect of the research in the field of physical layer security with imperfect csi . in addition , a brief description of the secrecy degrees of freedom , which applies for systems with pessimistic and strong csi assumptions , is presented as well .",
    "ergodic secrecy capacity applies for delay tolerant systems where the encoded messages are assumed to span sufficient channel realizations to capture the ergodic features of the channel .",
    "it captures the capacity limit under the constraint of perfect secrecy .",
    "typical examples of delay tolerant applications are document transmission and e - mail , which belong to the non - real time data traffic .",

    "this variable - rate scheme relies on the assumption of large coherence intervals and ensures that when @xmath22 , the mutual information between the source and the eavesdropper is upper - bounded by @xmath21 . when @xmath23 , this mutual information is equal to @xmath24 .",

    "the average power constraint is denoted by @xmath27 . according to eq .",

    "they developed upper and lower bounds on the ergodic secrecy capacity with perfect csi on legitimate receiver s channel and imperfect csi on eavesdropper s channel .",
    "they also investigated the ergodic secrecy capacity of fasting fading channel for both high snr and finitely many antennas , i.e , the number of transmitted antenna is very large .",

    "however , perfect secrecy can not always be achieved for systems with stringent delay constraints , and ergodic secrecy capacity is inappropriate to characterize the performance limits for such systems . on the other hand , outage - based characterizations , which measure systems with probabilistic formulations , become more appropriate . in  @xcite , assuming the fading is quasi - static , parada and blahut analyzed the scenario where the csi of both legitimate receiver s and eavesdropper s channels is not available at the transmitter .",
    "they provided an alternative definition of outage probability , wherein secure communications can be guaranteed for the fraction of time when legitimate receiver s channel is stronger than eavesdropper s channel .",

    "the expression of @xmath35 is given by @xmath37 they also showed that fading alone guarantees that physical layer security is achievable , even when the eavesdropper has a better average snr than the legitimate receiver .",
    "in addition , bloch et al . characterized the relationship between the upper bound of outage probability and the variance of the channel estimation error on eavesdropper s channel in  @xcite .",
    "the secrecy outage behavior of a multiple - input , single - output , single - eavesdropper ( misose ) fading system is studied in  @xcite , where the authors proposed a relation between the degree of channel knowledge and the tolerable secrecy outage probability . in  @xcite , the outage - based formulations capture the probability of having a reliable and secure transmission .",
    "reliability and security are not distinguished , since an outage occurs whenever the transmission is either unreliable or not perfectly secure . in  @xcite ,",
    "zhou et al . presented an alternative secrecy outage formulation which directly measures the probability that a transmitted message fails to achieve perfect secrecy .",
    "the alternative secrecy outage is formulated by @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath36 are the rate of transmitted codeword and the rate of the confidential information in the wire - tap code , respectively , and the outage probability is conditioned on a message actually being transmitted . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pso ] ) , we see that the new formulation takes into account the system design parameters , such as the rate of transmitted codewords and the condition under which message transmissions take place .",

    "the rigorous proofs for these facts were also provided .    in the work of  @xcite , although the instantaneous csi on the eavesdropper s channel is not required , the transmitter still needs the statistics of eavesdropper s channel . for the case where no csi on the eavesdropper s channel ( including the statistics ) is known at the transmitter , swindlehurst and",

    "then , a transmitted packet is unable to be decoded by the receiver , i.e. , the packet is corrupted , whenever the data transmission rate exceeds the legitimate receiver s channel capacity .",
    "second , with imperfect instantaneous csi on the legitimate receiver s channel , the artificial noise leaks into the legitimate receiver s channel , since the beamforming with artificial noise is designed according to the estimated instantaneous csi rather than the actual instantaneous csi .",

    "in the last section , we summarized the research results on physical layer security enhancements for systems consisting of a small number of nodes .",

    "specifically , the studies in  @xcite showed that the secrecy requirement does not reduce the capacity scaling of the network , i.e. , the capacity scaling law is the same for both insecure message transmission and secure message transmission .",
    "of course , achieving such an optimal scaling law under the secrecy constraint requires very different transmission and access protocols .",

    "although the scaling law results may provide insights into the asymptotic secrecy throughput performance of large - scale networks , a finer view of throughput is necessary to better understand the impact of key system parameters and transmission protocols , since most of design choices affect the actual ( non - asymptotic ) throughput but not the scaling behaviors . to this end",

    "we discuss some open problems in the research area of the physical layer security with imperfect csi .      among the existing work on physical layer security considering imperfect csi ,",
    "most investigates the impact of imperfect csi at the transmitter while assuming perfect channel estimation at the receivers .",
    "however , only a limited amount of work , e.g. , @xcite , paid attention to the imperfect channel estimation at the receivers .",
    "clearly , the assumption of perfect channel estimation at the receiver is not very practical , since the estimation of fading channels generally is not error - free . in principle",
    ", the channel estimation error exists at both the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper .",
    "assuming perfect estimation at the eavesdropper is more reasonable from the secure transmission design point of view , since it is often difficult or impossible for the transmitter to know the accuracy of the eavesdropper s channel estimate .",
    "nevertheless , in scenarios where the eavesdropper is just an ordinary user of the network whose performance and other information can be tracked by the transmitter , e.g. , @xcite , the consideration of imperfect channel estimation at the eavesdropper becomes relevant .      with few exceptions , almost all the existing research studies on physical layer security assumed that the eavesdropper s location is perfectly known .",
    "the validity of such an assumption strongly depends on the application under investigation .",
    "for example , when the eavesdropper is a passive entity without transmission , its location is very hard to be obtained . also , in large - scale complex networks , it is very difficult to obtain eavesdroppers locations due to the random deployments or mobility of nodes",
    ". therefore , it is an interesting research direction to consider the secrecy in networks with imperfect or no knowledge of the eavesdropper s location at the transmitter .",
    "in this paper , we reviewed the research in physical layer security with practical assumptions on fading channel information .",
    "for the characterizations of performance limits , we described ergodic secrecy capacity suitable for delay tolerant systems , outage - based characterizations for systems with stringent delay constraints , and secrecy degrees of freedom . also , we surveyed the signal processing secrecy enhancements proposed for different transmission scenarios , i.e. , secure on - off transmission for signal - antenna channels , beamforming with artificial noise for multi - antenna channels , and other signaling designs for relay channels or cognitive radio systems .",
    "in addition , the recent results on secrecy in large - scale decentralized wireless networks were reviewed .",
    "future research directions on physical layer security with imperfect csi include the imperfect channel estimation at receiver sides and the imperfect knowledge of the eavesdropper s location .",
