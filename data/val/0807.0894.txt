    "in a recent work  @xcite we have investigated the high energy regge behavior of mhv scattering amplitudes in the planar limit of @xmath0 supersymmetric yang mills theories , and we have found that , for n - point amplitudes with @xmath3 beyond the one loop approximation , the simple factorizing structure of the bern - dixon - smirnov ( bds ) conjecture  @xcite is not valid . in detail , it was shown that for the cases of the transitions @xmath4 and @xmath5 their factorized form is violated by regge cut contributions which satisfy the bfkl equation  @xcite in the color octet channel . these terms are obtained from specific single energy discontinuities , and in the scattering amplitudes they become visible in particular physical kinematic regions only . in the one loop approximation , these terms are correctly contained in the bds formula , but in higher orders they can not be cast into the simple exponential form conjectured by bern et al .    in this paper",
    "we further investigate these regge cut contributions .",
    "we study the bfkl equation in the color octet state , and we compute the two - loop expressions for the @xmath6 and @xmath7 amplitudes . in particular , we show that the collinear and infrared divergences of the bds formula are not affected by the regge cut contributions .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly review the derivation of the factorization - breaking contributions , and we write down the expression for the regge - cut contribution , using the calculus of complex momenta .",
    "sections 3 - 5 are devoted to the detailed investigation of this regge - cut contribution : we first ( section 3 ) study the structure of the infrared singularities , we then ( section 4 ) compute the two loop expressions for the cut contributions , and finally in section 5 we obtain the explicit solution of the bfkl equation for the octet channel . in the final section we present conclusions and further strategies .",
    "solutions of the bfkl equation for the forward case are presented in an appendix .",
    "in our previous paper we have studied the high energy regge behavior of scattering amplitudes of @xmath0 supersymmetric yang mills theories . in the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla )",
    "we can make use of the qcd calculations since the supersymmetric partners of quarks and gluons do not contribute ( in this limit @xmath8 channel exchanges with the highest spin dominate ) .",
    "we now summarize the main results of  @xcite . for @xmath9-point amplitudes with @xmath10 ,",
    "the high energy scattering amplitudes can be written as sums of separate pieces ( named ` analytic representation ' or ` dispersion representation ' ) .",
    "this decomposition reflects the analytic structure required by the steinmann relations  @xcite .",
    "the different terms appearing in this representation can be computed from single energy discontinuities ( ` imaginary parts ' ) or multiple energy discontinuities . to be definite ,",

    "for the @xmath1 scattering    we are interested in the kinematic limit ( double regge limit ) s s_1,s_2,s_3 t_1,t_2,t_3 , whereas the @xmath2 scattering process will be studied in the limit s s_13,s_02 s_1,s_3,t_2=(p_a - p_a -k_2)^2 t_1,t_2,t_3 .",
    "the analytic decompositions are illustrated in figs .",
    "[ disper24 ] and  [ disper33 ] .    in the physical region where all energies are positive , there are , both for the @xmath6 and for the @xmath7 case , substantial cancellations of the regge cut contributions between these five terms : in the sum their imaginary parts cancel , and the amplitude takes the well - known factorized regge form . in other physical regions , however , where some energies are positive and others are negative , the cancellations are less complete , and pieces become visible which do not show up in the region of only positive energies . for the @xmath6 case , the physical region of interest is [ 2to4mixed ] s>0,s_2>0 , s_1<0,s_3<0,s_012<0,s_123<0 . here",
    "non - vanishing discontinuities are only in @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and both of them contain a new term which violates the simple factorizing form .",

    "the non - vanishing discontinuities belong to @xmath11 and @xmath13 , and they , again , contain the regge cut pieces .    in  @xcite we have compared these results with the expression given by bern et al . whereas for the @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "amplitudes the qcd results are in full agreement with the bds formula , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bds amplitudes are correct only in the one loop approximation . for two or more loops , the regge cut piece can not be reproduced by the bds expression . as explained above",
    ", this implies that the bds formula ( in lla ) still gives the correct result in the physical region where all energies are positive , but it fails ( beyond one loop ) in the regions ( [ 2to4mixed ] ) and ( [ 3to3mixed ] ) .",

    "the holomorphic hamiltonian @xmath50 is slightly different from the corresponding hamiltonian for the singlet case h= = p + ( ) p+ .",

    "this equation allows us to write , instead of the gluon ladders , simple regge pole exchanges .",
    "the resulting @xmath11-discontinuity has the same form as the @xmath12 discontinuity with the impact factors @xmath17 and @xmath18 being replaced by _ 1 = , _ 2 = .",
    "one easily verifies that these modified impact factors coincide with the nonlocal pieces of @xmath17 and @xmath18 in eqs.([phi1 ] ) and ( [ phi2 ] ) .",
