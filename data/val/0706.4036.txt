    "classical be stars are non - supergiant b  stars that possess circumstellar material in the form of an equatorial disk . while the circumstellar disk is almost certainly a decretion disk of material from the star s atmosphere , the detailed mechanism that creates and maintains such",
    "a disk remains unclear @xcite .",
    "rapid rotation of the central b  star seems to play an important role , but there is still considerable debate as to the extent @xcite .",
    "historically , the observational evidence for such circumstellar material has been either spectroscopic or polarimetric in nature , and the accepted observational definition of a be star has been the appearance ( at the current or previous epoch ) of emission in the hydrogen balmer lines .",
    "it has been recognized since the days of @xcite that recombination in a flattened disk could reproduce the range of spectroscopically observed h@xmath1 profiles .",
    "in addition , the net ( continuum ) linear polarization observed in be stars is well explained by electron scattering from non - spherically distributed circumstellar gas @xcite .    beginning with the resolution of @xmath4persei ( b2  vpe ) at radio wavelengths with the very large array by @xcite",
    ", interferometry has increasingly been used to spatially resolve circumstellar material .",
    "be star disks have been resolved at radio , near - ir , and optical wavelengths , with these observations conclusively revealing the disk @xcite .",
    "the observations are consistent with the suggestion of @xcite that be star disks are geometrically quite thin with opening angles of only a few degrees .",
    "currently , optical interferometric observations require theoretical models of the emitting region in order to interpret the observed visibilities .",
    "often observers fit simple models with free parameters to the data to describe the disk emissivity .",
    "however , this simple procedure can be considerably improved by using a detailed model for the thermal structure of the be star disk .",
    "such models naturally predict the emissivity and opacity of the gas required to produce theoretical spectroscopic images @xcite .",
    "@xmath0cassiopeia ( hd  5394 ; b0  i ve ) is a interesting classical be star which has a dense , cool , equatorial disk @xcite .",
    "this disk has been resolved with optical interferometry @xcite .",
    "@xmath0cas is likely the primary in a binary system @xcite and has unique x - ray characteristics @xcite . although @xmath0cas is often quoted as ",
    "the prototypical \" be star , it has become clear that it possesses some unique characteristics .",
    "nevertheless , it is a well - studied star making it an appropriate choice to test new codes and compare results with previously published work . in this current paper",
    ", we extend the radiative - equilibrium models of @xcite and @xcite for the early be star @xmath0cas to a disk models with a solar chemical composition .",
    "the calculations in this paper were performed with a new code , bedisk , which is loosely based upon the calculational approach of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "models for the circumstellar material were constructed assuming a density distribution falling as an @xmath5 power - law in the equatorial plane , following the models of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . by comparing to observations of the infrared excesses of be stars , these authors found power - law density exponents in the range @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "perpendicular to the equatorial plane , it was assumed that the gas is in vertical , isothermal , hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "given the disk density distribution and the photoionizing radiation field from the central star , the equations of statistical equilibrium were solved for the ionization state and level populations of h , he , cno , mg , si , ca , and fe subject to the constraints of charge and particle conservation .",
    "radiative transfer was handled via the escape probability approximation , and it was assumed that the dominant escape route for photons was perpendicular to the exponentially stratified disk . from this solution , the rates of energy gain and energy loss at each computational grid point were obtained , and the local temperatures were iteratively adjusted to enforce radiative equilibrium .    the main features and assumptions of this code",
    "are now discussed in detail .",
    "the circumstellar disk was assumed to be axisymmetric about the star s rotation axis and symmetric about the mid - plane of the disk . in all that follows",
    ", @xmath8 is used for the radial distance from the star s rotation axis and @xmath9 , for the perpendicular height above the equatorial plane .",
    "thus the cylindrical co - ordinates of any disk location are @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath11 denotes the stellar radius , then the calculation domain is @xmath12 with @xmath13 , and @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "typically , @xmath16 is set to 60 with @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is set to 40 .",
    "the code accepts a user - defined set of atomic models which list the energy levels and the bound and free radiative and collisional transitions for each atom and ion to be included in the calculation .",
    "the set of atoms and ions and the total number of atomic levels and radiative transitions used for the current calculations are listed in table  [ tab : atomic_models ] . for this initial work ,",
    "the number of energy levels included for each atom and ion is similar to the list of energy levels given by @xcite .",
    "sources for the required atomic data are given in appendix  a. the abundances assumed for the various elements can be found in table  [ tab : abun ] and are taken from the accepted solar abundances of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the number of atomic levels included for each atom / ion in table  [ tab : atomic_models ] is fairly modest , although large enough to include most of the collisionally - excited lines seen in the optical and uv spectra of be stars . while non - lte solutions can be sensitive to the number of atomic levels included ( see , for example , @xcite for a case - study of cii in b  stars ) , the computational time also increases sharply with the number of levels .",
    "table  [ tab : atomic_models ] represents a compromise between realism and computational efficiency .",

    "all calculations assume that the density drops as an @xmath5 power - law in the equatorial plane , and at each @xmath8 , the gas is in vertical , isothermal hydrostatic equilibrium . to obtain the density above the equatorial plane at each radial distance ,",
    "the user supplies a fixed set of density - drops from the equatorial plane , @xmath19 for @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 by definition , and @xmath22",
    ". then the @xmath23 at which this density drop would occur , given the current value of @xmath24 , is computed assuming vertical hydrostatic equilibrium with an isothermal temperature @xmath25 , @xmath26 here @xmath1 is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the mean - molecular weight , @xmath29 for an ionized , pure hydrogen disk , and m is the mass of the central b - star .",
    "thus the density at @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 in this expression , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath25 ( through equation  [ eq : scaleh ] ) are the parameters which define the density structure of the disk .",
    "at each computational grid point , the photoionizing radiation field is required to evaluate the photoionization rates of all atoms / ions for the statistical equilibrium equations and to compute the photoionization heating rates for the radiative equilibrium solution .",
    "it is usual to divide this radiation field into a direct and diffuse contribution , @xmath34 the direct contribution represents the radiation from the central star while the diffuse contribution arises from the disk . note that despite this division , the only energy input into the circumstellar disk is assumed to be from the star itself so that ultimately , the energy in the diffuse field has its origin in direct radiation from the star .",
    "there is some evidence that @xmath35  cas has a binary companion with an orbital period of @xmath36 days @xcite .",
    "however , the exact orbit and the nature of the companion , including its spectral type and luminosity , are unknown . rather than introduce further uncertain parameters into the calculation ( and invalidate the axisymmetric geometry ) , we shall assume that the energy input into the disk of @xmath35  cas from any potential companion is negligible .",
    "the direct component from the central star to the photoionizing radiation field at grid location @xmath30 is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is an infinitesimal patch of solid angle centred around the direction @xmath39 .",
    "the integral is over the visible stellar surface .",
    "typically the surface is divided into a few hundred patches and the transfer equation is solved along a ray from the centre of each patch to the grid location .",
    "the radiation field at the stellar surface was taken from an lte stellar atmosphere of @xcite which specified the mean intensity , @xmath40 , at the top of the photosphere over a grid of 1221 frequencies .",
    "this was turned into the required intensity at each surface element by using the limb - darkening law @xmath41 where the coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 were linearly interpolated from table  v of @xcite . here",
    "@xmath28 is the usual cosine of the surface viewing angle .",
    "computing the mean intensity from this expression and setting it to the lte model atmosphere prediction , we find that @xmath44 while this procedure is approximate , and the exact @xmath45 for each @xmath28 predicted by the lte model could have been used , this approximation seems commensurate with others made in the construction of these models .",
    "we also note the use of a more physically realistic non - lte , line - blanketed atmosphere for @xmath40 would be a useful future improvement .",
    "in addition to limb darkening , gravity darkening induced by rapid stellar rotation can change the intensity distribution across the stellar disk and hence modify the direct component to the photoionizing radiation field . @xcite",
    "interferometrically resolved @xmath35  cas s disk and estimated its inclination angle to the sky .",
    "they conclude the @xmath35  cas rotates at @xmath46 of its critical velocity . as @xmath0cas does not seem to rotate particularly close to its critical velocity , we have not included gravity darkening ( and the associated geometrical distortion of it s surface ) into the calculation of the direct photoionizing radiation field .",
    "this point is further discussed in section  [ sec : mm ] where the adopted stellar parameters for @xmath0cas are discussed .",
    "the simplest treatment for the diffuse field is to employ the on - the - spot ( ots ) approximation in which the recombination rate to level @xmath33 of hydrogen is written as @xmath47 here @xmath48 is the optical depth at the continuum limit for photoionization from level @xmath33 along a vertical ray to the nearest edge of the disk ( this is consistent with our assumption that the dominant photon escape route is perpendicular to the disk see later discussion ) .",
    "thus the principle assumption of the ots approximation is that at high continuum optical depths , @xmath49 , recombination to level @xmath33 produces a photon that is locally absorbed within the same volume element , essentially undoing the recombination .",
    "including the continuum optical depth dependence in equation  ( [ eq : ots ] ) ensures that the ots approximation is used only when @xmath49 ; the full recombination coefficient is employed when the gas becomes optically thin in the continuum .",
    "we have applied to ots approximation only to recombination to level @xmath50 in hydrogen .",
    "the optical depths in the remaining continua are typically not large enough for a significant effect .",
    "we discuss a more complex , but still approximate , treatment for the diffuse field in section  [ sec : diffuse ] .    given the photoionizing radiation field and current estimates of the electron temperature and electron density at each grid location , we solve the statistical equilibrium equations to obtain the level populations for all atoms and ions .",
    "for atom @xmath51 , and all of its associated ions , these are @xmath52 for @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the number of atomic levels included for the @xmath55 atom and its ionization stages .",
    "note that these equations must be supplemented by a particle conservation equation of the form @xmath56 for each atomic species .",
    "the elemental abundance , @xmath57 , can be found from table  [ tab : abun ] .    in the case of bound - bound transitions",
    "@xmath58 , @xmath59 , the rates have the simple form @xmath60 and @xmath61 here the factors @xmath62 and @xmath63 represent collisional excitation and de - excitation respectively and are proportional to the maxwellian - averaged collision strength for @xmath64 transition .",
    "@xmath65 is the usual einstein transition probability for spontaneous emission .",
    "this form of the statistical equilibrium equations handles radiative transfer in the line via the escape - probability approximation .",
    "the escape probability for each grid location was obtained by computing the line - centre optical depth to the nearest vertical edge of the disk ( denoted @xmath66 ) and then using this optical depth to estimate the static , single - flight escape probability assuming complete redistribution in the spectral line .",
    "we have assumed that the dominant loss route for photons is perpendicular to the disk because of the exponential density stratification implied by vertical hydrostatic equilibrium . as it is reasonable to assume that the main motion of the disk gas is keplerian rotation about the central star",
    ", the doppler shifts experienced by photons escaping roughly perpendicular to the disk will be small , and it is appropriate to approximate the escape probability , @xmath67 , by a _ static _ , single - flight escape probability , as opposed to employing the sobolev approximation .",
    "this is consistent with the definition of @xmath66 as the optical along a ray perpendicular to the disk to the nearest edge ; @xmath66 is not defined in terms of a local velocity gradient as in the sobolev approximation .",
    "the form of the static , single - flight escape probability appropriate for complete - redistribution over a doppler profile is @xmath68 where @xmath69 @xcite . as this result",
    "is an asymptotic expansion ( essentially in the limit that the scale of variation of the line source function is large compared to the width of the scattering kernel ",
    "see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , an ad - hoc correction is needed to handle @xmath70 .",
    "here we have adopted the suggestion of @xcite where the escape probability is taken to be @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",
    "this function is continuous with the asymptotic result at @xmath73 and tends to the limit of @xmath74 as @xmath75 , a reasonable result if the collisional destruction probability of the line photon upon scattering is not too small .    in the case",
    "@xmath76 is a bound - free transition , the photoionization and recombination ( spontaneous plus stimulated ) rates are given by @xmath77 and @xmath78 here @xmath79 is the lte population ratio found from the saha - boltzmann equation and it is proportional to the electron density , @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "dielectronic recombination and autoionization are included by retaining the full resonance structure of the photoionization cross section @xmath81 .",
    "given the solution for the atomic level populations , a new estimate for the electron density can be made by enforcing charge conservation , and the rates of heating and cooling for the various atomic processes can then be computed .",
    "heating includes photoionization and collisional de - excitation while cooling includes radiative recombination and collisional excitation .",
    "detailed expressions for all of these processes can be found in @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to @xcite , transitions ( and the implied cooling ) due to radiative recombination were computed explicitly via equation  ( [ eq : recom ] ) for each atomic level ; total recombination co - efficients ( summed over @xmath33 ) were not used .",
    "heating due to viscous dissipation in a keplerian disk was also included @xcite but was always found to be negligible .",
    "net cooling due to free - free emission ( in the fields of hi and heii ) was included via the expression of @xcite , modified as suggested by @xcite to account for the reduction in the free - free cooling rate as the gas becomes optically thick to free - free radiation , @xmath82 here @xmath83 and the frequency cut - off , @xmath84 , suggested by @xcite , is the smallest frequency for which the optical depth to the nearest edge of the disk exceeds one .",
    "the gaunt factor , @xmath85 , which varies slowly with temperature , was set to a constant value of 1.2 which @xcite indicate will approximate the exact result to within 20% .    to find the equilibrium kinetic temperature , @xmath86 , at each grid location , heating and cooling",
    "were balanced by searching for a zero in the net - cooling rate , @xmath87 .",
    "the root was initially located via bisection and then refined with the secant method . in the rare case of multiple roots ,",
    "the stable one satisfying @xmath88 was chosen .",
    "the overall flow of the calculation is to start at the inner boundary of the disk , closest to the star at @xmath89 .",
    "solutions proceed downward in @xmath9 , from the top of the disk ( @xmath90 ) to the equatorial plane ( @xmath91 . this allows the optical depths back to the star and to the nearest edge of the disk to be kept current with the solution level populations .",
    "in this section , we first compare the predictions of our code with known results for @xmath0cas . next we explore a wide range of disk parameters for @xmath0cas and investigate the effect on the temperature structure of the disk of using a solar chemical composition for the gas .",
    "we then examine the energy loss in the spectral lines included in the models and compute the near infrared spectral energy distribution .",
    "finally , we examine the computation of the diffuse photoionizing radiation field generated by the disk itself in order to evaluate the use of the ots approximation for most of the models computed in this work .",
    "@xcite constructed a pure - hydrogen radiative equilibrium model for @xmath0  cas .",
    "@xcite ( mm , hereafter ) extended this work to include the ots approximation for the diffuse radiation field , and it is this temperature distribution which we have chosen for comparison .",
    "we adopt the same stellar parameters for @xmath0  cas as mm , which are reproduced in table  [ tab : gamma_cas_star ] .",
    "as we use these fundamental parameters for all of the calculations in this work , some additional comment is in order , particularly concerning the adopted stellar effective temperature .",
    "@xcite investigate of the effect of rapid rotation on fundamental parameter determinations of b  stars .",
    "they find , by fitting the line spectrum between @xmath92 and @xmath93 ,  apparent stellar parameters \" for @xmath0cas ( those obtained by a best fit classical , plane - parallel model atmosphere ) of @xmath94k and @xmath95 which are close to the parameters adopted in this work .",
    "nevertheless , they do find significant effects of rotation in their best - fit rotating models which have a _ parent non - rotating counterpart _ @xmath96 ( see their paper for details ) of @xmath97k .",
    "this result suggests that accounting for the rotation of @xmath0cas in a manner following @xcite ( but using non - lte stellar atmospheres ) would be a useful future improvement in the computation of the direct stellar contribution to the photoionizing radiation field .",
    "the fixed density structure for the @xmath0  cas disk adopted by mm is described by @xcite and is slightly different from the model described in section  [ sec : detail ] .",
    "mm assume that the disk is in isothermal , hydrostatic equilibrium at only one radial distance from the central star and that the radial drop - off in the equatorial density follows from an assumed ( radial ) outflow velocity law and the equation of continuity .",
    "we have simply adopted the @xmath30 grid of mm ( which is 24 by 20 ) and their total density at each grid point as input to bedisk .",
    "we have used a 5-level hydrogen atom plus continuum for this comparison and have also used the ots approximation ( as described previously ) for the diffuse field . despite this , there are still some significant differences between the calculations : our approach uses the optical depths in the ots approximation and in the line escape probabilities as opposed to the various cases of mm .",
    "we use a newer atlas stellar atmosphere to predict the photoionizing radiation field from the star and use many more rays from each grid point back to the star .",
    "no attempt was made to use identical atomic data : mm included collisional transitions for only transitions @xmath33 to @xmath98 in hydrogen whereas we have included all collisional rates .",

    "this significant difference is simply one of definition : the density - weighted average quoted by mm is actually defined as @xmath111 where the sum is over all of the grid points in the calculation . computing this quantity for the current bedisk model yields @xmath112  k which agrees with the mm result to within 5% .",
    "figure  [ fig : tratio_pm ] compares the ratio of the bedisk temperature to the mm temperature throughout the entire circumstellar disk .",

    "the largest differences tend to occur along with upper edge of the envelope where the optical depths ( to the nearest vertical edge of the disk ) are most rapidly changing .",
    "the treatment of the escape of line radiation , as noted above , and particularly of how the ots approximation was implemented ( mm applied ots to the whole disk as opposed to including an optical depth dependence as in equation  [ eq : ots ] ) , are likely the origin of the more significant differences .",

    "this behaviour can be understood in terms of the heating and cooling avenues introduced by metals .",
    "metals can act to cool the gas due to the escape of collisionally - excited line radiation .",
    "however , metals can also help to heat the gas via photoionization .",
    "if the optical depths in the hydrogen continua ( excluding the lyman continuum ) are low , then the additional heating provided by the photoionization of metals is negligible in comparison to hydrogen . in this case",
    ", it is the cooling due to collisionally - excited line radiation that dominates . in a low - density disk , line cooling is further enhanced by the small optical depths ( and hence high escape - probabilities ) in the lines .    at high densities ,",
    "however , the optical depths in the hydrogen bound - free continua are much larger ; photoionization heating due to metals can then become important , particularly as many abundant metals have bound - free thresholds in the short - wavelength region of the balmer continuum which is near the photospheric flux maximum in b  stars . in this case , metals add both heating and cooling and the net result is a very similar density - weighted temperature to the case of a pure hydrogen plasma .",
    "these trends help explain why @xcite where able to obtain a reasonable density - weighted temperature for @xmath35  cas despite using a pure hydrogen envelope .",
    "two - dimensional temperature distributions in the disk for several different density @xmath117 models are shown in figure  [ fig:2dtemp ] .",
    "the inner portion of the disk for @xmath137 is expanded in each case for clarity .",
    "these figures clearly show the development of a cool region near and in the equatorial plane for the higher density disks .",
    "these denser disks have fairly strong vertical temperature gradients perpendicular to the equatorial plane . given this",

    "however , as the focus of the present work is on the thermal structure of the disk , it is convenient to have a fixed density structure so that the thermal effect of the gas metallicity can be unambiguously seen",

    "these trends are consistent with the effects noted in the discussion of the density - weighted average disk temperatures .      figure  [ fig : halpha_flux ] plots the total energy lost in h@xmath1 ( in @xmath122 ) by the 16 models of table  [ tab : models ] .",
    "the line luminosity was found by integrating the flux divergence , in the escape probability approximation , over the volume of the disk , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath143 for h@xmath1",
    ", @xmath144 is level @xmath145 of hi and @xmath146 is level @xmath147 . also shown in the figure is the h@xmath1 luminosity observationally determined by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath1 luminosity from @xmath0cas is known to be variable , but the cited values are typical of the current epoch .",
    "there is good agreement with the observed luminosity for @xmath117 models with @xmath32 between @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "this result is consistent with the models that best fit the observed disk temperature of @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath118 models seem inconsistent with the total energy loss in h@xmath1 for the range of disk densities considered .",
    "figure  [ fig : line_flux ] shows energy escaping in all of the included radiative transitions for the @xmath117 model with @xmath150 .",
    "the fluxes are again found by integrating eq .",
    "[ eq : lum ] over the disk .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that figure  [ fig : line_flux ] is not a spectrum ( which would be obtained by integrating the transfer equation along a series of rays through the computational domain ) ; it is simply a plot of the energy loss per second in each line acting to cool the gas .",
    "nevertheless , it gives a good indication of the expected strong emission lines in the disk spectrum .",
    "for this particular model , 94% of the energy loss is provided by the lines of hi .",
    "contributing at the level of @xmath151% percent are feii , cii , mgii , and hei .",
    "next to the lines of hi , the largest energy losses are in the resonance lines @xmath152  line of cii ( @xmath153 ) and the h and k lines of mgii near @xmath154 .",
    "although it does not possess a single strong line , cooling due to feii dominates over all of the metals due to its rich spectrum with many collisionally - excited lines .",
    "it should be noted that figure  [ fig : line_flux ] and the percentage contributons cited above represent a _ global _ picture of energy loss integrated over the entire disk .",
    "the impact of the heating and cooling contributions of metals can be much larger at individual grid locations as demonstrated by figure  [ fig : add_metals ] .      in this section",
    ", we consider the predicted ir continuum energy distribution as emitted _ perpendicular _ to the disk .",
    "such models have a zero inclination angle between the rotation axis and the observer s line of sight .",
    "this spectrum is easily found by solving the radiative transfer equation vertically through the disk at each @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath155 is the emergent intensity for the annulus of area @xmath156 then the sed seen by the observer will be @xmath157 here @xmath11 is the radius of the star , @xmath158 is the specific intensity corresponding to the stellar surface , and @xmath159 is the specific intensity of the @xmath160 disk annulus .",
    "it is well known that at ir wavelengths , be stars possess an excess of radiation over that predicted by an appropriate stellar photosphere model @xcite .",
    "this excess comes mainly from free - free emission in the ionized disk , with a small contribution from free - bound emission shortward ( in wavelength ) of the ionization edges .",
    "the near - ir spectral energy distributions are shown in figure  [ fig : ir ] for the @xmath117 models of table  [ tab : models ] .",
    "plotted is the ( monochromatic ) ir excess expressed in magnitudes , @xmath161 the discontinuous jumps at wavelengths less than  @xmath162 m in this figure , particularly for higher densities , represent the hydrogen free - bound continua for recombination to @xmath163 ( @xmath164 m ) and @xmath165 ( @xmath166 m ) . unlike ( plane - parallel ) stellar photospheres which have bound - free edges in absorption ( reflecting the inward increase in temperature ) , circumstellar material exhibits the bound - free edges in emission , reflecting the increase in the gas emissivity due to recombination .",
    "thus the figure indicates a small contribution from free - bound emission to the infrared excess at these wavelengths .",
    "we also note that as the disk density is increased , the infrared excess steepens most strongly between the wavelengths of 1 and 5@xmath167 m .    to compare with observations , we first show the @xmath168 and @xmath169 m iras ir excesses for @xmath0cas found by @xcite .",
    "the model that best matches the iras ir excess at these wavelengths has a slightly smaller density , @xmath135 , than the model that best matches the observed average disk temperature and energy loss in h@xmath1 , @xmath170 ( figure  [ fig : denaverage ] ) .",
    "however , there is good evidence that @xmath0cas is seen at an inclination of @xmath171 @xcite , as opposed to being viewed pole - on ( @xmath172 ) as assumed by the models . hence the models have an effective emitting area that is too large and",
    "the ir excess is likely overestimated .",
    "in addition , the spectra for non - zero inclination angles will reflect the contribution of a different set of rays passing through the disk ; the different physical conditions along these rays will lead to differences in the gas opacity and emissivity and hence a different predicted intensity along each ray .",
    "we also show in figure  [ fig : ir ] the 2.5 to 11.6@xmath132 m infrared space observatory ( iso ) spectrophotometry for @xmath0cas . in order to compare the iso fluxes at the earth to our photospheric model ( to set the reference flux to extract the excess )",
    ", we require the angular diameter of the star . @xcite",
    "cite the major axis of the h@xmath1 emitting region of @xmath0cas of @xmath173milli - arcseconds , but this has a large contribution from the circumstellar disk . to resolve this problem ,",
    "we have chosen an angular diameter such that the iso data reproduces the @xmath174 m iras excess . combining this stellar angular diameter for @xmath0cas with the range of hipparcos distances listed in table  [ tab : gamma_cas_star ] , we find a required radius for @xmath0cas of between 6.8 and 8.4 solar radii . while this result in disagreement with the 10 solar radii listed in table  [ tab : gamma_cas_star ] , the larger value is within the plausible error range for @xmath0cas s radius . with this normalization ,",
    "the iso observations match reasonably well with the @xmath175 model prediction over the considered wavelength range .",
    "the fit is actually worse closer to the normalization point ; the shorter wavelength excess , between @xmath176 m , is quite well reproduced .",
    "similar caveats to those ending the previous paragraph apply here : a detailed comparison will be made with a model that correctly accounts for the viewing inclination of @xmath0cas in a future work .      while the ots approximation is simplest treatment of the diffuse radiation field , figure  [ fig:2dtemp ] shows that in the densest disks ( @xmath177 ) , grid locations near the equatorial plane can become quite cool due to large optical depths back to the central star . however , examining the thermal structure in the z - direction at such a location typically shows that at heights above and below the equatorial plane , the gas can still be quite hot as it can be directly illuminated by at least a portion of the star .",
    "one might expect that the radiation emitted from these hot  sheaths \" might be an important source of secondary photoionizing radiation for the equatorial gas @xcite .    in principle ,",
    "the calculation of @xmath178 in eq .",
    "[ eq : jnu ] requires a solution of the transfer equation in the 2d cylindrical geometry .",
    "however , to estimate the potential effect of this diffuse field on the current work , we have tried a simpler and approximate approach .",
    "we solve , at each @xmath24 , the radiative transfer equation perpendicular to the disk in the z - direction using the method of short - characteristics @xcite .",
    "the mean intensity along this ray is then @xmath179 for this solution , zero incident radiation is assumed perpendicular to the disk , we then estimate the diffuse contribution to the photoionizing radiation field at each @xmath23 by assigning @xmath180 here @xmath181 represents an ad - hoc dilution factor , between zero and one , for the perpendicular rays .",
    "the expectation is that @xmath178 will potentially be most important in the cool equatorial regions that develop for higher density disks such as the one illustrated in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig:2dtemp ] . in such a cool obscured region , the hot sheaths above and below cover approximately @xmath74 of the available @xmath182 steradians so a dilution factor of @xmath183 is a reasonable approximation . in regions of the disk where the central star is not obscured",
    ", the choice of @xmath181 is irrelevant as @xmath184 .",
    "for this reason , we have taken @xmath181 to be @xmath74 at all grid locations in the disk .",
    "figure  [ fig : add_diff ] shows the effect of adding such an approximate treatment of @xmath185 to the @xmath117 disk model with @xmath186 , the model which best matched the observed disk temperature and the total h@xmath1 luminosity . with the diffuse field added ,",
    "the amount of additional heating in the equatorial plane is fairly small , with only a @xmath187% increase in the temperature there .",
    "hence , we feel that the previously computed models are reliable despite the approximate treatment of the diffuse field through the ots approximation .",
    "note that this figure is not meant to imply that the effect of the diffuse field is negligible ; in both runs , the on - the - stop ( ots ) approximation , which approximates the local trapping of radiation with @xmath188  and hence the diffuse photoionizing radiation field for @xmath188  was employed following eq .",
    "[ eq : ots ] if the ots approximation is turned off , there is considerable cooling of the equatorial regions according to eq .",
    "[ eq : add_diff ] should also employ the ots approximation . in principle , employing both over counts the local radiation field in each volume element . ]",
    "( see also * ? ? ? * ) and this would mask the effect ( illumination of these same regions from above and below ) that we were trying to investigate .",
    "for the first time , we have constructed radiative equilibrium models for the disk of @xmath0cas using a gas with a solar chemical composition .",
    "we find that a model with a power - law equatorial gas density of @xmath2 to @xmath189 , which is in vertical ( isothermal ) hydrostatic equilibrium , can reproduce several overall observed disk properties , including its ( density - weighted ) average temperature , the energy loss in h@xmath1 , and the near infrared flux excess .    also in this work",
    ", we have investigated the differences between our solar composition radiative equilibrium models and the corresponding set of pure hydrogen models with the same disk parameters .",
    "the effect of the additional heating and cooling provided by elements heavier than hydrogen on global measures of the disk structure , such as the density - weighted average disk temperature or the total energy loss in h@xmath1 , depend strongly on the parameter @xmath32 ( the assumed equatorial density near the stellar surface ) which sets the overall density of the disk . for low disk densities , @xmath190 ,",
    "the density - weighted averaged disk temperature is generally 12000  k cooler with a solar composition , due mostly to enhanced collisionally - excited line cooling . at higher densities ,",
    "absorption of ionizing radiation in the bound - free continua of elements heavier than hydrogen provides additional heating which offsets somewhat the additional line cooling .    in examining the detailed temperature at each position withing the disk , differences of up to @xmath191% are found in comparing the solar composition models to the pure hydrogen models .",
    "while the global energy loss in h@xmath1 in the solar and pure hydrogen models is similar , these significant differences in the disk temperature distribution may manifest themselves in the detailed spectra .",
    "the next step in the comparison between these two sets of models is to present predicted spectra over a wide range of wavelengths for a wide range of viewing inclinations .",
    "the bedisk code represents a compromise between computational efficiency and realism .",
    "the code s most notable approximations are the treatment of the disk diffuse radiation field , the use of ( first - order ) static , escape probabilities for the line radiative transfer , the assumption of a spherical , non - rotating , central star , and the somewhat limited atomic models .",
    "nevertheless , these approximations allow the code to efficiently explore a wide region of parameter space for the thermal structure of the circumstellar disks surrounding hot stars .",
    "future work will proceed along two fronts : we will use the current version of bedisk to compute a series of be disk thermal models that will serve as the basis for detailed spectral synthesis to produce line profiles , interferometric visibilities , and continuum polarization signatures which can be directly compared to observations . along the second front , we shall improve some of the basic assumptions of the code .",
    "most notably , we will enforce a vertical hydrostatic equilibrium density structure consistent with the thermal solution , allow for potential gravitational darkening ( and geometric distortion ) of the central star by rapid rotation , and account for the diffuse photoionizing radiation field from the disk by a direct solution of the 2-d radiative transfer problem .",
