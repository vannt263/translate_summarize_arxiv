    "the electron crystal has created considerable interest since its possible existence was first pointed out by wigner  @xcite .",
    "the three - dimensional wigner crystal and its two - dimensional counterpart have been extensively studied , and there exist beautiful experimental realizations of the latter using electrons trapped on the surface of liquid helium  @xcite .",
    "more recently , wigner crystallization in one dimension has received renewed interest  @xcite ; for recent reviews see refs .   and .",
    "the realization of a one - dimensional system requires the dominance of the confining potential over internal energies , in particular , the inter - particle interactions . upon increasing density ( and , thus ,",
    "the interaction energy ) , or weakening the confining potential , the crystal deviates from its strictly one - dimensional structure .",
    "it has been shown that at a critical density , a transition to a zigzag crystal takes place  @xcite . though not for electrons , this zigzag transition has indeed been observed using @xmath0mg@xmath1 ions in a quadrupole storage ring  @xcite .    here",
    "we investigate the structural properties of the classical quasi - one - dimensional wigner crystal beyond the zigzag regime . while previous investigations  @xcite concentrated on regular structures , we are interested in the formation of defects . from symmetry considerations",
    "the assumption of regular crystals is plausible at low densities when the number of rows is small , however , its validity is not at all obvious once the lateral extent of the crystal increases at higher densities .",
    "in fact , one expects a nonuniform charge density in the direction transverse to the wire axis .",
    "in particular , considering the electrostatics problem of charges confined by a parabolic potential , @xmath2 , the density profile should obey @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the width of the system  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the assumption of perfect rows with equal linear densities should eventually break down .",
    "the formation of defects is of particular interest because they will have a direct impact on the transport properties of the system : while regular rows are locked , defects are expected to be mobile .",
    "we consider classical particles in two dimensions interacting via long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "the system is assumed to be infinite in the @xmath5-direction and confined in the transverse @xmath6-direction by a parabolic confining potential @xmath7 .",
    "the energy of the system then reads @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the dielectric constant of the material and @xmath10 is the frequency of harmonic oscillations in the confining potential .    at low densities ,",
    "the system is one - dimensional , and the particles minimize their mutual coulomb repulsion by occupying equidistant positions along the wire , forming a structure with short - range crystalline order  the so - called one - dimensional wigner crystal  @xcite . upon increasing the density , the inter - electron distance diminishes , and the resulting stronger electron repulsion eventually overcomes the confining potential @xmath7 , transforming the classical one - dimensional wigner crystal into a staggered ( zigzag ) chain . from the comparison of the coulomb interaction energy @xmath11 with the confining potential an important characteristic length scale emerges .",
    "indeed , the transition from the one - dimensional wigner crystal to the zigzag chain is expected to take place when distances between electrons are of the order of the scale @xmath12 such that @xmath13 . within our model , _",
    "i.e. _ , for a parabolic confining potential and coulomb interactions , the characteristic length scale @xmath12 is given as @xmath14 it is convenient for the following discussion to measure lengths in units of @xmath12 . to that purpose",
    "we introduce a dimensionless density @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the linear density of the system .",
    "rescaling lengths , the energy can be written as @xmath17,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 .",
    "as a first step , we minimize the energy assuming regular rows , aiming to find approximate values for the density range in which a configuration with a given number of rows is stable . assuming staggering in the @xmath5-direction between neighboring rows and inversion symmetry of the @xmath6-positions of the rows with respect to the wire axis , the number of minimization parameters is @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) for even ( odd ) number of rows @xmath21 , and the minimization is straightforward . within these constraints ,",
    "the minimization of the energy with respect to the electron configuration reveals  @xcite that a one - dimensional crystal is stable for densities @xmath22 , whereas a zigzag chain forms at intermediate densities @xmath23 .",
    "more rows appear as the density further increases .",
    "the number of rows as a function of @xmath24 is shown in table [ table_1 ] .",
    ".[table_1]number of rows in the crystal as a function of the dimensionless density @xmath24 , assuming regular structures . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "eventually , one expects that more complicated structures will appear .",
    "the simple configuration we studied is in competition with structures where defects appear away from the edges , such as structures of the type @xmath25 $ ] , for example .",
    "detailed calculations within these simplified models reveal that such structures are indeed competitors for the ground state , but up to 13 rows such a minimum is not realized .",
    "to approach the transition between regular and defected rows , we use a different trick . an unbiased search for the global minimum",
    "is numerically costly because a simple minimization may get stuck in a metastable minimum .",
    "however , if the initial guess of the electron configuration is sufficiently close to the global minimum , a simple minimization will converge .",
    "having identified the structure of defects in region i , one may feed such structures into a simple minimization at lower densities .",
    "the results of such a procedure have been included in figs .",
    "[ fig - nu_def ] and [ fig - y ] .",
    "there , structures with defect densities down to @xmath26 were obtained with the full minimization , whereas structures close to the phase boundary with lower defect structures were obtained with the method described here .",
    "the results suggest that the defect density indeed vanishes at the transition which points to a second order phase transition .",
    "we study quasi - one - dimensional systems of classical particles interacting via long - range coulomb interactions and confined by a parabolic potential in the transverse direction .",
    "the ground state configurations are multi - row wigner crystals where the number of rows is controlled by the density ( or the strength of the confining potential ) .",
    "we find that defects that accommodate the density variation in the transverse direction appear once the number of rows exceeds four .    defected structures have less particles in the outer than in the inner rows .",
    "the full numerical minimization for five rows reveals that two distinct types of defected phases exist . upon increasing density ,",
    "the regular structure at low - densities is replaced by a structure with symmetric defects , _",
    "i.e. _ , where the center of the defect on the two outer rows is located at the same @xmath5-position . as the number of particles that can be simulated sets a lower limit on the defect density that can obtained , the full minimization allows one only to provide an upper limit for the density at the transition from regular to defected structures .",
    "we extend our calculations to lower densities by using structures with the type of defect described above as the input for a simple minimization .",
    "the results indicate that the defect density vanishes at @xmath27 and that the transition is of second order . to obtain symmetric defects ,",
    "the longitudinal distortion of the inner rows , namely an increased density at the center of the defect , is crucial . any analytical description of the transition would have to take into account this distortion .    upon further increasing density",
    ", the defect density rapidly increases . at a critical density , @xmath28 , structures with a different type of defect corresponding to a sinusoidal distortion of the rows with a phase shift of half a period between the two outer rows",
    "become become the ground state .",
    "this second regime is characterized by a defect density that barely varies with density and extends up to the transition to six rows .",
    "the transition between the two defected phases with different symmetries is first order .",
    "simplified models neglecting the corrugation of the rows only capture this second defected phase .",
    "thus , these models do not allow one to further investigate the nature of the phase transition from regular to defected structures .",
    "however , as this second phase occupies most of the density interval , they may be used to study the stability of regular structures upon increasing the number of rows .",
    "we find that beyond nine rows , no stable regular structures exist .",
    "taking into account that the simplified model overestimates the energy of defected structures , we expect that stable regular structures may disappear even earlier .",
