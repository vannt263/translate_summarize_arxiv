    "optomechanical cooling of micro- and nano - mechanical resonators to their quantum ground state , is used in a wide variety of sensitive measurements such as detection of weak forces @xcite , small masses @xcite and small displacements @xcite .",
    "such mechanical resonators can also be used as tools for quantum metrology @xcite or as a medium to couple hybrid quantum systems @xcite . in recent years , different types of optomechanical systems have established considerable cooling of the vibrational modes of mechanical resonators interacting with optical cavity @xcite . in such systems ,",
    "the cavity exerts radiation pressure on the mirror .",
    "the dynamics of the mirror is coherently controlled by an external pump laser .",
    "therefore , by modifying the pump power , a strong coupling regime can be easily acheived @xcite .",
    "in such a strong coupling regime , the mechanical oscillator can be cooled to its quantum ground state using the dynamics of back - action @xcite .",
    "experimentally , significant cooling of the mechanical mode of the resonator coupled to an optical cavity has been attained by using two different ways of radiation pressure interaction between the intracavity field and a vibrational mode : back - action cooling @xcite and cold damping feedback @xcite .",
    "self cooling of the mechanical resonator via dynamical back - action arises due to its interaction with the optical cavity through radiation pressure @xcite .",
    "depending upon the laser detuning , the correlations , induced by the cavity delay , between the brownian motion of the resonator and the radiation pressure force lead to either cooling or amplification .",
    "experimentally , a single mechanical mode has been cooled using these effects @xcite . with the back - action cooling or self cooling ,",
    "there is self modification in the dynamics of the mechanical system as the off resonant operation of the cavity results in the retarded dynamical back - action on the system @xcite .",
    "cold damping quantum feedback technique is used to cool the oscillating mirror by applying a viscous force on the mirror via radiation pressure generated by another intensity modulated laser beam on the back of the mirror @xcite .",
    "this technique increases the damping of the system without any additional noise @xcite .",
    "other feedback scheme requires very large mechanical quality factor @xcite for the ground state cooling of the oscillator whereas cooling can be much more conveniently achieved in the cold damping scheme .",
    "the optomechanical systems composed of ultracold atoms enclose within a cavity has grabbed much attention@xcite .",
    "the resonance frequency of the cavity is altered due to the strong interaction of the condensed atoms with the cavity mode @xcite .",
    "an all - optical transistor based on a coupled bose - einstein condensate(bec ) cavity system @xcite has been proposed @xcite .",
    "an optomechanical system consisting of bec in an optical cavity has been investigated recently @xcite . by virtue of interaction of bec with mechanical oscillator ,",
    "such hybrid system was helpful in acheiving state engineering of the mechanical mode of oscillator , which can be easily controlled and highy insensitive to noise effects .",
    "experimentally , interaction between the ultracold atoms and vibrating membrane has been studied @xcite . in our previous work",
    ", we have investigated how the stochastic cooling feedback technique together with a gas of condensate confined in an optical cavity can be used to detect weak forces and coherently controls the sensitivity of this hybrid optomechanical system @xcite .    motivated by these interesting features in the field of cavity opto - mechanics and bec",
    ", we compare the two schemes i.e. , back - action cooling and cold damping quantum feedback , for cooling an optomechanical system in which a bec is coupled to an optical cavity with a movable mirror . by comparing these two schemes for such a system , we found that the cold damping quantum feedback scheme cools the mechanical oscillator to its ground state in the bad cavity limit ( @xmath0 ) i.e , when cavity bandwidth is greater than the mechanical frequency while the back - action cooling is efficient in the opposite limit of good cavity ( @xmath1 ) i.e. , when cavity bandwidth is smaller than the mechanical frequency .",
    "we also show that for both the schemes , in the presence of atom - atom coupling , the interaction of the vibrational mode of the mirror , single mode of the intracavity field and the condensate fluctuations give rise to normal mode splitting .",
    "in this section , we introduce our model and describe the hamiltonian for our system .",
    "our model consists of an elongated cigar shaped gas of n two - level bec atoms of @xmath2 in the @xmath3 state with mass @xmath4 and transition frequency @xmath5 of the @xmath3 @xmath6 @xmath7 transition of the @xmath8 line .",
    "the bec atoms strongly interact with a single one - dimensional quantized cavity mode of frequency @xmath9 .",
    "the cavity has one mirror fixed and another mirror movable of mass @xmath10 which acts as a mechanical oscillator that is free to oscillate at mechanical frequency @xmath11 . the coherent laser field with frequency @xmath12 drives the system through the fixed cavity mirror with amplitude @xmath13 .",
    "the cavity and the laser field are treated quantum mechanically as the standing wave and the pump laser are weak ( small photon number ) .",
    "the single - particle hamiltonian in the rotating wave and dipole approximation for the system under consideration is read as @xcite :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 represents the kinetic energy of the condensate .",
    "@xmath16 is given by @xmath17 in which the first term gives the energy of the light mode , with lowering ( raising ) operator @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) ( @xmath20=1 $ ] ) and cavity - pump detuning @xmath21 .",
    "the second term in @xmath16 is the energy due to external pump laser .",
    "a band pass filter is used in the detection scheme @xcite such that only a single vibrational mode can be considered by neglecting the several other mechanical degrees of freedom arising from the radiation pressure .",
    "@xmath22 gives the energy of the single vibrational mode of the cantilever with annihilation ( creation ) operator @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) ( @xmath25=1 $ ] ) . as a result of the pressure exerted by the intracavity photons on the mirrors",
    ", there is an optomechanical coupling between the vibrating mirror and the cavity field .",
    "hence a force is exerted on the movable mirror by the electromagnetic field which depends on the number of photons in the cavity .",
    "this field is phase shifted by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the wave vector of light field and @xmath28 is the displacement of the mirror from its equilibrium position .",
    "the scattering of the photons into other modes of the electromagnetic field can be ignored and hence validating the single mode approximation of the cavity field .",
    "also , a reservoir having finite temperature @xmath29 is attached to the movable mirror . in the absence of the radiation pressure exerted by the optical cavity field , the cantilever can undergo brownian motion due to its contact with thermal environment .",
    "@xmath30 describes the interaction of the light field with the bec which involves the classical potential @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the optical lattice barrier height per photon given by @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35(@xmath36 ) representing the mirror - atom coupling and atom - pump detuning respectively .",
    "we take @xmath37 as in this case condensate atom moves towards the nodes of the optical field due to which the lowest bound state is localized at these positions . therefore compared to the case @xmath38 , the interaction between the optical cavity field and the condensate atom is decreased for @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath39 represents the energy due to non linear dispersive coupling between the position quadrature of the movable mirror and the intensity of light field where @xmath40 is the mirror - photon coupling .",
    "the hamiltonian in second quantized form with the two - body interaction is given as :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the atom field operator and @xmath43 is the s - wave scattering length . using @xmath44 , we derive the bose - hubbard hamiltonian . here , @xmath45 is the wannier function and @xmath46 is the corresponding annihilation operator for the @xmath47 bosonic atom .",
    "experimentally , the optical lattice depth is tuned such that time scales over which the experiment is performed is smaller than the time scales over which tunneling takes place , hence the tunneling of the atoms into neighbouring wells can be neglected in deriving the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , hamiltonian reads as :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the onsite kinetic energy of the atoms .",
    "@xmath50 is the effective onsite potential energy of the atoms .",
    "the last term in the above hamiltonian represents the two - body atom - atom coupling where @xmath51 represents the effective onsite atom - atom interaction energy .",
    "now , we study the quantum langevin equations(qles ) of the system .",
    "the qles of motion for the boson field operator @xmath52 , cavity photons @xmath18 and movable mirror ( mode ) operator @xmath23 are given as :    @xmath53    @xmath54+\\eta'-\\frac{\\kappa}{2}b(t)+\\sqrt{\\kappa}b_{in}(t),\\ ] ]    @xmath55    due to leakage of photons from the mirror , the cavity field is damped .",
    "therefore , we have introduced @xmath56 as the cavity field damping rate .",
    "also , the interaction of the cantilever with environment damps the mechanical mode with damping rate @xmath57 . during the experiment , the condensate atoms are robust and therefore the depletion of atoms is not significant . since the condensate temperature is much smaller than @xmath58 , so",
    ", there is negligible coherent amplification of the condensate motion .",
    "the mechanical mode is also affected by a random brownian force which has @xmath59 as zero mean value .",
    "the vaccum radiation input noise is represented by @xmath60 .",
    "the correlation functions for the input noise operators are given in the appendix i. the qles are linearized around the steady state as @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 where @xmath64,@xmath65 and @xmath66 are the steady state values of cavity mode , mechanical mode and condensate density respectively . @xmath67 atoms occupy @xmath68 number of lattice sites .",
    "it is assumed that all the sites of optical lattice are same , therefore @xmath69 is replaced by @xmath70 . by introducing the amplitude and phase quadratures as @xmath71 $ ] , @xmath72 $ ] ,",
    "@xmath73 $ ] , @xmath74 $ ] , @xmath75 $ ] , @xmath76 $ ] , @xmath77 $ ] and @xmath78 $ ] , the linearized qles for the system are given as follows :    @xmath79    @xmath80    @xmath81    @xmath82    @xmath83    @xmath84    where @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 $ ] which satisfies the correlation given in the appendix i.    let us now understand how the radiation pressure cools the mechanical oscillator .",
    "radiation pressure exerted on the movable mirror by the optical cavity mode forms a system which acts as another reservoir connected to the mechanical oscillator when the cavity is properly detuned . as a result , the effective temperature of the vibrational mode is the temperature between the two reservoirs i.e. , between the initial bath temperature and temperature of this effective optical reservoir .",
    "this effective temperature is zero in practice .",
    "hence the quantum ground state is acheived when the coupling to the initial reservoir , given by the damping rate of the movable mirror @xmath57 , is much smaller than the coupling to the effective optical reservoir .",
    "this explains us that the radiation pressure coupling should be strong for significant cooling of the mechanical oscillator .",
    "now , we shall see in the next sections how the different cooling techniques help in cooling the mechanical oscillator to its quantum ground state .",
    "back - action dynamics have been realized in a diverse variety of physical systems , including those of ultracold atoms @xcite.the randomness present in the unavoidable stochastic back - action forces is due to the photon shot noise .",
    "these forces arise from the radiation pressure .        in this section ,",
    "we evaluate effective frequency , effective damping rate and displacement spectrum for the mechanical oscillator ( mirror ) in the back - action cooling scheme .",
    "also we show how the ground state cooling of the mirror is approached in this scheme .",
    "the displacement spectrum in fourier space is evaluated from    @xmath93    using the correlations in fourier space given in the appendix i. therefore , the displacement spectrum in the fourier space for the movable mirror is given as :    @xmath94,\\ ] ]    where @xmath95 is the thermal noise spectrum arising from the brownian motion of the mirror and @xmath96 is the radiation pressure spectrum including the quantum fluctuations of the condensate .",
    "@xmath97 is the effective susceptibility of the oscillator .",

    ". rest of the parameters are same as figure 13(a ) . ]    now , we characterize the steady state energy of the mirror in the cold damping feedback scheme .",
    "the optimal cooling conditions can be obtained using the stability conditions which are modified in this scheme given in the appendix ii .",
    "the oscillator variances represented by eqns .",
    "( [ delq ] ) and ( [ delp ] ) and the mean energy of the oscillator given by eqn .",
    "( [ energy ] ) , using the corresponding position spectrum for the cold damping case , are calculated numerically with the help of mathematica 8.0 .",
    "this shows that , also using cold damping , there is no equipartition of energy i.e. , @xmath107 in general .",
    "fig.13(a ) illustrates both the variances @xmath108 and @xmath109 as a function of dimensionless detuning ( @xmath110 ) for the absence of bec and three different values of condensate two - body interaction ( @xmath111 ) , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 . as it can be seen from the figure , the displacement and momentum variances decrease significantly on adding bec to the system .",
    "moreover , both variances decrease with the increase in condensate two - body interaction .",
    "however , as @xmath115 approaches zero , oscillator variances increase drastically in the presence of bec .",
    "therefore , one can infer that the presence of bec helps in cooling the mirror for smaller detunings .",
    "so , in order to approach the optimal cooling conditions in cold damping scheme , the sum of these variances given by equations ( [ delq ] ) and ( [ delp ] ) is to be minimized which can be done by increasing the condensate two - body interaction .",
    "the effective phonon number given by eqn .",
    "( [ neff ] ) is shown in fig.13(b ) as a function of dimensionless detuning ( @xmath110 ) for the absence of bec ( thick solid line ) and the three different values of atom - atom interaction , @xmath112(dashed line ) , @xmath113(thin solid line ) and @xmath114(dot dashed line ) . from the figure",
    ", we observe that the minimum value of effective mean excitation number is reached for @xmath113 which is @xmath116 with @xmath117 .",
    "although , as @xmath118 , the cavity field amplitude quadrature @xmath119 becomes insensitive to the mirror motion and @xmath120 increases considerably with increasing @xmath111 .",
    "so , the ground state cooling can be approached by adding bec to the system involving cold damping feedback scheme for lower detunings .",
    "hence , by varying the atom - atom interaction , one can optimize the cooling process to acheive the ground state . using cavity self - cooling scheme ,",
    "least value of @xmath120 is acheived in the absence of bec while using cold damping feedback technique , minimum value is obtained by adding bec to the system .",
    "moreover , with bec , we are getting the least value of effective phonon number using back - action cooling scheme .",
    "we have also shown the variation of effective phonon number @xmath120 as a function of @xmath121 in fig.(14 ) .",
    "it clearly illustrates the fact that , in the presence of bec , the ground state cooling of the mechanical oscillator can be achieved for higher condensate two - body interaction only .",
    "this sudden increase in the value of @xmath120 for very small atom - atom interaction is the consequence of the decrease in the effective mechanical damping rate of the mirror given by eqn.([gcd ] ) in this region . since in this chosen parameter regime , the second term in eqn.([gcd ] ) becomes excessively small and even negative for very small @xmath111 .",
    "moreover , we have also examined that by taking @xmath122 , keeping other parameters same as before , the uncertainty principle is stratified for both displacement and momentum variances .",
    "this implies that @xmath123 , therefore , energy equipartiton is satisfied .",
    "however , the ground state could not be approached in this regime i.e. , we are getting @xmath124 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied how the back - action cooling and cold damping feedback schemes help in cooling the mirror to its quantum ground state by using a bec confined in an optical cavity .",
    "the atom - atom two body interaction can be used as a new handle to cool the quantum device in both the schemes .",
    "it provides a systematic control of the system which can be altered either by using number of atoms or s - wave scattering length .",
    "both the techniques show distinct displacement spectrums involving energy exchange between the different modes of the system .",
    "a coherent control over the feedback parameters , @xmath125 and @xmath126 , can manipulate the displacement spectrum in the cold damping feedback scheme . in back - action cooling",
    ", the least value of effective phonon number is obtained without bec whereas in cold damping , it is obtained with bec .",
    "the effective temperature of the oscillator does not vary much for higher condensate two - body interaction with self - cooling .",
    "also in this scheme , higher negative detuning gives lesser value of effective phonon number in the presence of bec as compared to that in the absence of bec .",
    "as we compare both the schemes , the minimum value of effective phonon number is obtained using cavity self - cooling with bec .",
    "we have analyzed that both the techniques help in approaching the quantum ground state of the oscillator .",
    "dicrimination in the ideal cooling conditions for these schemes exhibits that back - action dynamics is more convenient in good cavity limit ( @xmath1 ) while cold damping is preferable in bad cavity limit ( @xmath0 ) .",

    "it should be noted that brownian noise is non - markovian in nature .",
    "the quantum brownian motion of the movable mirror gives rise to the thermal noise term in the measured phase noise spectrum of the optical field reflected from the cavity @xcite .",
    "the amplitude and phase quadratures of the input noise operator satisfy the following correlations in fourier space @xcite :    @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 .",

    "<S> we present a detailed study to show the possibility of approaching the quantum ground - state of a hybrid optomechanical quantum device formed by a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) confined inside a high - finesse optical cavity with an oscillatory end mirror . </S>",
    "<S> cooling is achieved using two experimentally realizable schemes : back - action cooling and cold damping quantum feedback cooling . in both the schemes , we found that increasing the two body atom - atom interaction brings the mechanical oscillator to its quantum ground state . </S>",
    "<S> it has been observed that back - action cooling is more effective in the good cavity limit while the cold damping cooling scheme is more relevant in the bad cavity limit . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that in the cold damping scheme , the device is more efficient in the presence of bec than in the absence of bec . </S>"
