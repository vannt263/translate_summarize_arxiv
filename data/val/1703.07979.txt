    "one generally has to proceed as follows , as initially outlined in @xcite :    1 .",
    "determine the divergent integrals that arise after expanding the integrand of the given integral and performing a term by term integration ; 2 .",
    "obtain the finite parts of the divergent integrals ; 3 .   obtain the complex contour integral representation of the finite parts ; 4 .   represent the given integral as a complex contour integral using the same contour of integration as the finite part integrals ; 5 .",
    "perform the expansion of the integrand under the contour integral of the given ( convergent ) integral and proceed with the term by term integration ; 6 .",
    "recover the missing terms from the singularities of the integrand in the complex plane .",
    "we apply these steps in the evaluation of the integral ( [ incomplete ] ) .",
    "since we wish to obtain an expansion that yields the asymptotic behavior as @xmath8 , we use the binomial expansion of @xmath3 about @xmath34 . substituting this expansion back into the given integral leads to an infinite series of integrals @xmath35 the integrals are divergent when @xmath5 is analytic at the origin , except possibly for @xmath36 , due to the non - integrable singularity at the origin .",
    "we have then identified the relevant divergent integrals and they are given by @xmath37 this accomplishes the first step in the application of finite - part integration .",
    "next is to obtain the finite part of these integrals .",
    "this is done by temporarily modifying the divergent integral to become convergent , followed by identifying the terms that diverge as the modified integral approaches the given divergent integral .",

    "<S> these dominant terms are precisely the terms missed out by naive term by term integration . furthermore , it is demonstrated how finite - part integration leads to new series representations of special functions by exploiting their known stieltjes integral representations . </S>"
