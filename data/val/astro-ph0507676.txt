    "hard x - ray surveys are an efficient means to define agn samples , as hard x - ray emission is able to penetrate the dust and gas capable of obscuring an agn s optical , uv , and soft x - ray emission .",
    "however , agn with high columns of absorbing gas can be missed even in the hard ( 2 - 10  kev ) x - ray .",
    "many local agn have very high absorbing column ; seyfert 2 s are about four times more numerous than seyfert 1s ( maiolino & rieke 1995 ) , and more than half of seyfert 2 nuclei are compton thick with n@xmath7  @xmath6 ( maiolino et al . 1998 ; risalti et al .",
    "x - ray background population synthesis models predict that agn are similarly obscured out to high ( @xmath8 ) redshift ; @xmath960% of high - redshift agn are predicted to have obscuring columns greater than n@xmath10  @xmath6 ( e.g. , comastri et al .",
    "2001 , gilli 2004 ) . if distant agn are indeed this obscured , the deep hard x - ray _ chandra _ surveys will be moderately incomplete for obscured agn ( n@xmath11  @xmath6 ) ; treister et al .",
    "( 2004 ) estimate 25% incompleteness at n@xmath12  @xmath6 .",
    "such surveys will also miss nearly all of the compton - thick agn , a large population of which are expected both locally and in the high - redshift universe ( c.f .",
    "ueda et al . 2003 ) .",
    "quantifying the fraction of agn missed by current surveys is necessary if we are to understand the accretion history of the universe .",
    "in addition , the identification of heavily obscured agn is in itself interesting , as such sources are poorly understood in the distant universe .",
    "the availability of deep mid - infrared ( mir ) and radio images of the _ chandra _ deep field north ( cdfn ) provides a new way to search for heavily obscured agn , as extinction in the mir and radio is small .",
    "radio - excess agn are significantly brighter in the radio relative to the infrared than are star - forming galaxies , which fit the well - defined radio / infrared correlation ( helou et al .",
    "1985 ; appleton et al .",
    "2004 ) . with the deep mir data , we have separated the radio - excess agn population from star - forming galaxies by comparing their radio and mir flux densities .",
    "because this radio / infrared method of classification is independent of the optical , uv , and x - ray characteristics of the deep radio sample , we detect via this selection approach agn that are missed at other wavelengths , thereby testing the completeness of current agn samples .",
    "we find that a significant number of radio - excess agn do not appear even in the deepest available x - ray surveys .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 we discuss the radio and infrared observations and data reduction .",
    "the x - ray faint agn population is introduced in  3 , followed by a discussion of redshifts in  4 .",
    "we focus in  5 on lower - significance x - ray detections , along with the x - ray coaddition of undetected agn .",
    "the discussion follows in  6 , and we summarize the conclusions of the paper in  7 .",
    "our initial sample consists of 371 radio sources detected at 1.4  ghz by the richards et al .",

    "adopting the new value for this source would push it further into the agn regime in our selection method but would have no effect on the conclusions of this paper . ] .",
    "we later restrict this initial sample to those sources with x - ray exposures @xmath15 1  ms ; this reduces the radio sample size to 162 , and the effective area of the survey to @xmath16230  arcmin@xmath17 ( alexander et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the 24  properties of the radio sources are determined from a @xmath14 1400s spitzer mips observation of the cdfn .",
    "the mips 24  image was processed with the mips gto data analysis tool ( gordon et al .",
    "the measured count rates are corrected for dark current , cosmic - rays , and flux nonlinearities , and are then divided by flat - fields for each mips scan - mirror position .",
    "images are then interpolated to half pixels , corrected for geometric distortion , and mosaicked .",
    "the final mosaic has a pixel scale of @xmath18 pix@xmath19 , with a point - spread function full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath20 .",
    "source extraction at 24  was performed using the task _ allstar _ in the daophot package of iraf ( see prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "we detect 1868 24  sources in the @xmath15  1  ms field , 1167 of which have flux densities higher than the 80% completeness limit of the mips 24  image processed in this manner , 80  @xmath13jy  ( papovich et al . 2004 ) .",
    "systematic photometric errors in the mips photometry are small ( @xmath21 ) , so the measurement accuracy is determined by statistical errors ( about 15@xmath13jy rms ) and confusion noise ( about 11@xmath13jy rms ) .",
    "the 1.4  ghz and 24  sources were matched using a 2search radius , after adjusting the 24  positions to remove any systematic positional offset between the radio and infrared images .",
    "we exclude from our final radio - excess agn sample one radio source whose nearest 24  counterpart lies between 2  and 3of the radio position , as the reliability of counterparts in this region is ambiguous . if a source was not detected because it is blended with a brighter 24  source , we use the flux density of the blended source as a conservative upper limit .",
    "sources that were not detected at 24  were assigned the @xmath22 limit of 80  @xmath13jy . at the detection limits ,",
    "there are @xmath14 0.7 radio sources and @xmath14 5 infrared sources per square arcmin .",
    "consequently , one expects @xmath14 3 false coincidences of radio and 24@xmath13 m sources in the entire sample .",
    "since we identify agn by their relatively faint 24@xmath13 m flux densities , the false detections will tend to remove some agn from our sample but will not bias our results otherwise .",
    "we also use a 500  s irac observation of the cdfn .",
    "the irac observations were divided into 4 dithers of 125  s each ; the 5@xmath1 point source sensitivity limits for the irac 3.0 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  bands are 1.4 , 2.8 , 18.4 , and 22.7  @xmath13jy  respectively ( fazio et al .",
    "the irac data analysis is described in huang et al .",
    "source extraction in the irac bands was conducted using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "optical and near - infrared ( nir ) photometry are measured from datasets published for the cdfn by the goods team ( _ bviz _ , giavalisco et al .",

    ", we choose the counterpart that is nearest the radio position and use its individual sextractor magnitude , measured within an elliptical aperture corresponding to 2.5 times the kron radius ( kron 1980 ) .",
    "the magnitudes measured in the goods dataset in this way are identical to those given by giavalisco et al .",
    "when multiple goods counterparts are available , we choose the nearest source and do not use the ground - based optical data , which is likely to be blended .",
    "we use the 1.4  ghz and 24  flux densities of our sample , along with the well - known radio / infrared relation of star - forming galaxies and radio - quiet agn , to select a sample of radio - excess agn independently of their x - ray properties .",
    "appleton et al .",
    "( 2004 ) define @xmath23 = log ( f@xmath24/f@xmath25 ) .",
    "they show for star - forming galaxies that @xmath23 is tightly constrained out to z @xmath14 1@xmath26 @xmath23 = 0.94 @xmath27 0.23 after k - correction .",
    "galaxies with values of @xmath23 well below this range ( strong radio with respect to 24  emission ) are unlikely to be dominated by star formation and instead are radio - emitting agn ( drake et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the selection criteria .",
    "we set a selection threshold of @xmath28  to classify a galaxy as probably having an agn and require a _",

    "( 2003 ) catalog .    because of the lack of spectral information , we have chosen not to k - correct our radio and infrared flux densities and instead illustrate in figure 1 the redshift evolution of @xmath23 for galaxies with liner , seyfert 2 , spiral galaxy , and ultra - luminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) templates , normalized to the best - fit value of appleton et al .  (",
    "templates were taken from devriendt et al .",
    "a spectral index of @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) was assumed for the radio continuum .",
    "for the liner , seyfert 2 , and spiral templates , the observed @xmath23 is slightly larger than the intrinsic value out to redshifts of @xmath31 . redshifting a ulirg",
    "sed causes the observed @xmath23 to drop below the intrinsic value as @xmath32 increases .",
    "because we have not k - corrected our flux densities , we use the slightly higher non k - corrected dispersion , @xmath33 , from appleton et al . to calculate the significance of our selection threshold at @xmath34 .",
    "our selection threshold of @xmath28  is 3.4 standard deviations below the average value of @xmath23 at @xmath34 , and therefore our sample should not be significantly contaminated with normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "the significance of our selection at @xmath35 depends on each object s individual sed , and will increase slightly for liners , seyfert 2 s and spirals , but decrease for ulirgs .",
    "we estimate the maximum error on the measured values of @xmath23 by assuming both a radio and infrared flux density of 80 @xmath13jy , the approximate limits of our survey .",
    "this corresponds to a 5@xmath1 24 detection and a 10@xmath1 radio detection and gives an error of 0.1 on @xmath23 ; we therefore do not expect our sample to be strongly affected by errors in the flux determination .",
    "the crowded nature of several of the fields implies that some of our sources may have blended 24  emission .",
    "this will cause @xmath23 to increase , however , and will therefore remove sources from our radio excess sample instead of introducing contaminants .",
    "yun et al . (",
    "2001 ) define radio - excess objects as those with radio emission exceeding the radio / fir correlation prediction by a factor of @xmath0  5 ( a behavior hereafter described as a radio excess by a factor of 5 ) . from the measurement of this correlation by appleton et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , the corresponding threshold would be @xmath23 @xmath36 0.24 at @xmath37 . at @xmath38 ,",
    "the radio - excess threshold ranges from @xmath39 to @xmath40 for liner , seyfert 2 , or spiral galaxy templates .",
    "for all these cases , our selection criterion of @xmath28  ( which corresponds to a radio excess of 8.7 ) isolates radio - excess agn . for a ulirg template , the radio - excess threshold is -0.30 at @xmath41 ; a @xmath23 of 0 for such a template at @xmath41 corresponds to a radio excess of 2.5 , half the agn threshold suggested by yun et al .",
    "as will be discussed in  4 , however , a small fraction of the sources in our sample have ulirg seds , and all are likely to be agn .",
    "following drake et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , radio - loud objects would have @xmath42 at @xmath43 ; since few sources fall in this range , the agn sample consists almost entirely of radio - intermediate sources , as illustrated in the histogram inset in figure 1 .      at high redshift ,",
    "the 24  emission of normal star - forming galaxies is dominated by pah features , which are absent at low metallicity ( e.g. , houck et al . 2004 , engelbracht et al . 2005 ) . as figure 1 demonstrates , however , low metallicity",
    "star - forming galaxies also tend to have @xmath44 and therefore they should not contaminate our radio - excess agn sample .",
    "nearly all star - forming galaxies in the field fit the radio / infrared correlation . even within dense galaxy clusters , where environmental effects might boost the radio emission , the relation holds well with only a tiny minority of galaxies having radio excesses as large as a factor of five ( miller & owen 2001 ) .",
    "bressan et al .",
    "( 2002 ) show that a radio excess is expected in post - starburst galaxies due to the slower fading time of the radio emission with respect to the fir ; their models predict a maximum radio enhancement of @xmath45 above the radio / fir correlation .",
    "as mentioned above , our selection criterion selects agn whose radio enhancements exceed a factor of @xmath46 in liner , seyfert 2 , and spiral galaxy templates .",
    "we therefore expect minimal contamination from post - starburst galaxies .",
    "the strong silicate absorption feature seen in a handful of ulirgs is another potential source of sample contamination .",
    "this feature is centered at 9.7   and would therefore be redshifted into our 24  band at redshifts of @xmath47 , where it could suppress the observed infrared flux density .",
    "four of the x - ray non - detected radio - excess sample have redshifts in this range .",
    "it is unlikely , however , that a large fraction of agn are affected in this way .",
    "the 12  flux of agn provides the best estimate of their bolometric luminosity , allowing for effective infrared selection ( spinoglio & malkan 1989 ) .",
    "the silicate absorption feature is within the iras 12  passband , and evidently has only a secondary effect on the luminosity estimate .",
    "in fact , @xmath48% of high - luminosity agn have silicate _ emission _ features ( hao et al . 2005 ) . in such cases , the @xmath23 of true agn will be shifted towards the star - forming range , resulting in incompleteness in our sample , but not contamination .      because the 95% completeness limit of the radio sample is equal to the upper limit we can place on the flux densities of non - detected 24  sources , 80  @xmath13jy , restricting the radio flux densities to @xmath49  @xmath13jy",
    "would provide a 95% complete radio - excess ( @xmath28 ) sample ( subject to the cautions mentioned above ) . while we do not apply a radio flux - density cut for the sample discussed in this paper , only one agn in our sample , an x - ray non - detected source , has a radio flux density that falls below this limit .",
    "in addition , the counterpart uncertainties and 24  blending discussed in  2 only led to the removal of one source that could fall into such a complete sample .",
    "therefore , if we were to define a complete sample by requiring that @xmath49  @xmath13jy , our sample would essentially remain the same .",
    "also , in  2 we estimated that up to 3 radio - excess agn would be removed from our sample due to chance coincidences with 24@xmath13 m sources ; this process will reduce the sample size but have no other effect .",
    "thus , we can say that for a sample of 27 radio - excess objects in the cdfn ( with x - ray exposures in excess of 1  ms ) that is sufficiently complete to be largely unbiased for this class of agn , 16 ( 60% ) sources are previously uncataloged as agn .",
    "the remainder of this paper probes the characteristics of these objects in more detail .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts for 8 agn , and photometric redshifts for an additional 2 , were taken from the literature ( barger et al .",

    "it is likely that the large radio spatial extent of these sources is due to powerful radio jets oriented approximately in the plane of the sky .",

    "this is consistent with a picture in which our viewing angle to the x - ray detected agn is aligned closer to the jet axis , resulting in more core - dominated , and therefore flatter , radio emission .",

    "we calculate absorption - corrected x - ray luminosities , assuming an intrinsic photon index of @xmath73 .",

    "they are subject to relatively large errors , given the uncertainties in the measurements of @xmath65 at low signal to noise as well as possible intrinsic variations in the photon index .",
    "they are nonetheless useful as rough estimates .",
    "because there is no x - ray k - correction for a spectrum with @xmath73 , rest - frame 0.5 - 8  kev luminosities are equivalent to observed - frame , absorption - corrected 0.5 - 8  kev luminosities .",
    "we overplot on figure 6 , as solid lines , the rest - frame 0.5 - 8  kev x - ray luminosities of all sources with known redshifts and column density estimates .",

    "since a typical radio spectrum has a slope of @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) , we do not apply any k - corrections to the ratio of radio to x - ray flux density .",

    "of the 28 sources , 16 are radio - intermediate ( q @xmath15 -1.6 ) and four more are only slightly more radio luminous ( -1.6 @xmath15 q @xmath15 -2 )",

    "this study uses _ chandra _ data for bright quasars over a large range of redshift .",
    "the sample is mostly useful to augment the statistics for radio quasars , which are not well represented in the sambruna et al .",
    "figure 7 shows that the overall behavior of @xmath111  is as one might expect from selection biases : a sample of agn selected in the x - ray tends to be relatively brighter in x - rays compared with the radio than does a sample of agn selected in the radio ( i.e. the control sample ) . because our use of @xmath111  normalizes both samples to radio flux density ,",
    "this behavior reflects an intrinsic difference in radio - to - x - ray spectral energy distributions , and is not simply an effect of low - luminosity radio sources without x - ray counterparts .",
    "_ if the local radio - detected sample has analogs at higher redshift , as expected , they would fall below the current _ chandra _ detection limit , yielding incomplete samples in the x - ray .",
    "_    the @xmath111  distribution of the 5 x - ray weakly - detected sources is clearly more consistent with that of the control sample than the full _ chandra_-detected sample .",
    "the @xmath111  distributions also suggest that some fraction of our x - ray non - detected agn are more similar in nature to these local agn than they are to the full _ chandra_-detected sample .",
    "in contrast , the radio - excess x - ray detected agn sample is more consistent with the overall _ chandra_-detected sample than with the local agn sample .",
    "a two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test gives a probability of 4% that the full _ chandra_-detected and radio - excess x - ray detected agn are drawn from the same sample . the corresponding probability for the _ chandra_-detected and radio - excess x - ray weakly - detected agn sample is 0.2% .",
    "the large values of @xmath111  for the control sample and the x - ray weakly- or non - detected sample could be due to intrinsically lower x - ray to radio luminosity , to heavy obscuration , or to some combination of the two .",
    "we test the obscuration hypothesis by comparing @xmath117 , the ratio of compact to total radio emission , to @xmath111  for the control sample .",
    "the compactness , log  @xmath117 , is often used as an indication of the orientation of the radio source relative to the observer . if the source is viewed down the jet axis , log  @xmath118 , and the flux is dominated by beamed emission . as the viewing angle moves away from the jet axis ,",
    "log  @xmath117 becomes more negative .",
    "figure 8 compares log  @xmath117 to @xmath111  for all of the control sample except 3c28 .",
    "we have excluded this object because the x - ray emission from its position appears to be strongly dominated by emission by its galaxy cluster , not the agn ( hardcastle & worrall 1999 ) .",
    "there is a strong correlation in the sense that the more negative log  @xmath117 , the larger @xmath111 .",
    "that is , the more the radio jets are aligned away from the observer , the weaker the x - rays are relative to the radio .",
    "this behavior is consistent with a standard unification model where the circumnuclear torus plays an increasing role in absorbing the x - rays as the viewing angle of the central accretion disk approaches edge - on .",
    "the parameter @xmath111  therefore appears to be correlated with viewing angle , and consequently with obscuration , in local samples .",
    "we note that the 2 highly radio - resolved sources discussed in  6.1 also have the highest values of @xmath111 , a result that is consistent with the above interpretation .",
    "the relatively high limits on @xmath111  for the x - ray non - detected agn therefore suggest that the beamed radio emission of these agn is aligned away from us , increasing their likelihood of being heavily obscured .",
    "we plot in figure 9 the intrinsic x - ray to radio emission ratios , @xmath119 , for the x - ray weakly - detected and x - ray detected samples .",
    "we calculate @xmath119  by correcting the observed 0.5 - 8  kev x - ray flux for the estimated column densities .",
    "we assume a photon index of @xmath73 when applying this correction . because the radio spectral slopes are known for the majority of the sources for which we have column density estimates , we apply a radio k - correction , such that @xmath119  @xmath120 log ( f@xmath25/f@xmath121 ) + @xmath122log@xmath123 .",
    "we list the values of @xmath119  in tables 2 and 4 . for sources without",
    "known radio spectral indices , we assume @xmath29 .    the x - ray detected sample has , on average , a lower @xmath119  than the x - ray non - detected sample , although there is a significant amount of overlap between the 2 samples and many of the sources have only lower limits on @xmath119 .",
    "this suggests , however , that some fraction of the x - ray detected sample may have intrinsically higher x - ray luminosities ( with respect to their radio luminosities ) than do sources that were not detected in the x - ray .",
    "such a conclusion is in agreement with the absorption - corrected x - ray luminosities , which are generally higher for the x - ray  detected agn .",
    "a sample of intrinsically x - ray weak agn with hard x - ray spectra was studied by risaliti et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who suggest that such objects could contribute significantly to the hard component of the x - ray background . unfortunately , because we do not have column density estimates for the x - ray non - detected sources , it is unclear whether this trend will hold for the entire sample .",
    "it is also possible that a selection effect is responsible for the apparently lower intrinsic x - ray luminosities of the x - ray weakly - detected sample .",
    "because the x - ray detected and x - ray weakly - detected samples span similar ranges of column densities , it is likely that the agn that were previously x - ray detected are those that are intrinsically the most luminous .",
    "the optical to x - ray emission ratio is a powerful diagnostic for distinguishing agn from star - forming galaxies ( e.g. maccacaro et al .",
    "agn typically lie within log @xmath124 ; at the highest fluxes probed by the cdfn , the mean agn flux ratio is consistent with log @xmath125 , whereas at lower fluxes , the mean ratio rises slightly due to increased optical obscuration ( barger et al .",
    ". starbursts and lower - luminosity agn populate the transition region ( @xmath126 log@xmath127 ) , whereas normal star - forming galaxies , starbursts , and llagn typically have x - ray to optical flux ratios of log  @xmath128 ( see barger et al .",

    "we place a lower limit of r=25.0  mag on sources with no r - band counterpart . for sources with multiple goods counterparts , but only a single ground - based r - band counterpart , we treat the r - band magnitude as a lower limit .    of the 11 hard x - ray - detected radio - excess agn , all but 1 lie within the agn or transition regions , as expected .",
    "the source that lies in the quiescent galaxy region is the llagn , vla  j123652 + 621444 , discussed in  6.2 .",
    "the current x - ray and optical limits also place the x - ray weakly- and non - detected agn primarily in the agn region , with 3 extending into the transition region .",
    "higher sensitivity x - ray observations are needed to determine the true locations of the sample .",

    "the column densities to the x - ray - detected members of our sample are similar to those of the x - ray weak agn , although they extend to lower absorbing column .",
    "all but 1 ( or 2 if a compton reflection component is considered ) fall in the range of obscured but not compton - thick agn .",

    "we show that a local sample of radio agn has a ratio of radio to x - ray emission that shows a dependence on viewing angle consistent with the effects of x - ray absorption by a circumnuclear torus . * indicators such as the ratio of optical to x - ray emission , the intrinsic absorption - corrected x - ray luminosities , and the radio luminosities all support the argument that the weak x - ray sources are similar in intrinsic properties to the agn selected in a similar way but with stronger x - ray fluxes .",
    "this similarity would be strengthened by the usual tendency that any sample selected in a given spectral band ( e.g. , x - ray or radio ) will tend to include preferentially the sources of a given population that are relatively brighter in that band .    in summary , @xmath14 60% of radio - excess agn",
