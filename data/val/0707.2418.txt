    "3c 445 ( z=0.05623 , eracleous & halpern 2004 ) is a powerful frii galaxy ( p@xmath4 w hz@xmath5 sr@xmath5 ) showing a pair of double - lobes whose radio axis are misaligned by 2@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "it it classified as a broad line radio galaxy ( blrg ) because of its broad and intense balmer lines ( fhwm@xmath7=3@xmath8 km s@xmath5 ) produced in a region of size r=1.2@xmath9 cm @xcite .",
    "the optical continuum exhibits decreasing polarization with increasing wavelength as expected in polarization induced by dichroic absorption ( rudy et al .",
    "1983 , cohen et al . 1999 ) .",
    "near infrared spectroscopical observations confirms a substantial reddening of the blrg region by e@xmath10 mag ( rudy & tokunga 1982 ) .",
    "the broad @xmath11 line is also seen in polarized light .",
    "its polarization angle changes by about 45@xmath6 from the red to the blue wings .",
    "this suggests a blr inside the torus , rotating in an equatorial plane only partially seen by the observer .",
    "both the red and blue - shifted emission lines from the clouds are scattered by material surrounding the blr .",
    "cohen et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggested that the scattering region coincides with the inner wall of the torus .",
    "dust presence in 3c445 has been recently provided by iso and spitzer observations ( freudling et al .",
    "2003 , haas et al .",
    "in particular the radio - to infrared sed of 3c445 indicates a predominance of dust emission in the infrared region and a negligible contribution of synchrotron photons .",
    "the sed modeling based on spherical radiative transfer calculations indicates an extended dust region of 125 pc radius and a quite large visual extinction a@xmath12 = 16 ( siebenmorgen et al .",
    "the presence of cold circumnuclear matter has been also supported by several x - ray observations , all showing a nuclear component strongly absorbed .",
    "the x - ray spectrum appears complex and structured requiring more power - laws absorbed by different column densities ( yamashita & inoue 1997 , sambruna et al .",
    "1998 , wozniak et al .",
    "1998 , grandi malaguti & fiocchi 2006 ) .",
    "interestingly , the estimated column density , ( @xmath13 @xmath14 ) implies a reddening of the blr much larger than that observed ( if a standard galactic @xmath15 ratio is assumed ) . as discussed by maiolno et al .",
    "( 2001a , 2001b ) , this discrepancy can be solved if a predominance of larger dust grains ( when compared to the galactic interstellar medium ) occurs in the circumnuclear agn clouds .",
    "although classified as broad line radio galaxy , 3c 445 appears to be a quite peculiar source , different from the other blrgs which are generally characterized by seyfert  1-like x - ray spectra ( grandi , malaguti & fiocchi 2006 ) .",
    "finally , we mention that a narrow line qso located at only @xmath16 from 3c  445 has been discovered by xmm - newton ( grandi et al . 2004 ) .",
    "its spectrum is extremely soft and well represented by a power law ( photon index , @xmath17 ) plus a black body component ( @xmath18  ev ) absorbed by galactic @xmath19 .",
    "the presence of this agn in the vicinity of 3c  445 adds uncertainties , casting doubts on previous x - ray analysis based on limited spatial resolution data . in this paper",
    "we present a xmm - newton observation , which does unambiguously disentangle the different components of the 3c 445 spectrum .",
    "in particular we show that the soft x - ray radiation is a mix of emission lines and scattered continuum produced by a photoionized gas located well beyond the torus and the blr .",
    "a more coherent geometrical / physical picture of this source , more similar to seyfert 2 galaxies than to blrgs , will be proposed .",
    "xmm - newton observed 3c  445 on december 6 2001 for 23 ks . in this",
    "papers data of the reflection grating spectrometer [ rgs ; @xcite ) , and of the european photon imaging cameras ( epic - mos , @xcite ; epic - pn , @xcite ] are presented .",
    "the epic ( mos and pn ) cameras were operated in `` small window '' mode .",
    "the analysis was performed using the sas software ( version 6.5.0 ) . since no significant pile - up was present in the data ,",
    "single and double pixel events were selected . after filtering out periods of high background",
    "we obtained net exposures of about 17  ks for the two mos camera and @xmath2012  ks for the pn camera .",
    "the source plus background counts were extracted from circular regions with a radius of 42 arcsec ; the background spectra from source  free regions in the same chip as the source .",
    "the response matrices were created using the sas commands arfgen and rmfgen .    the rgs yields high - resolution ( first order resolution 600 - 1700  km  s@xmath5 )",
    "spectra in the 635    ( 0.352  kev ) range .",
    "the cross - dispersion slit has a 5@xmath21 diameter , thus encompassing the whole optical diameter of the optical galaxy .",
    "data were reduced from the _ observation data files _ , according to standard procedures as in guainazzi & bianchi ( 2006 ) .",
    "it suffices here to say that we have used sasv6.5 @xcite , and the most updated calibration file .",
    "source spectra were generated assuming an aspect reconstruction centered on the nominal optical coordinates of the 3c  445 nucleus .",
    "background spectra were generated from blank fields accumulated over the mission .",
    "all spectral fits presented in this paper include absorption due to a line - of - sight galactic column density of @xmath19=5.01@xmath2210@xmath23 @xmath14 ( murphy et al .",
    "errors are quoted at the 90 per cent confidence level ( @xmath24 ) for one interesting parameter .",
    "the cosmological parameters used throughout the paper are @xmath25 km@xmath5 s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , @xmath26 and q@xmath27= 0 .",
    "the x - ray spectral complexity of 3c  455 is well known from previous studies .",
    "therefore we initially decided to consider only the energy range between 2 - 10 kev to avoid the highly structured soft emission while analyzing the hard x - ray continuum .",
    "the combination of a photoelectrically absorbed power - law and of a gaussian emission line profile was the first model applied to the epic spectra , simultaneously fitted .",
    "the fit was formally acceptable , but the power law was extremely hard ( @xmath28 ) implying , as expected , that a more complicated model is required .",
    "bepposax data ( grandi malaguti & fiocchi 2006 ) indicated the presence of a reflection hump ad high energies , with a relative reflection normalization , r=1.2 .",
    "however , it was impossible to significantly constrain the value of @xmath29 due to the insufficient quality of the data and to a possible contamination of the 15 - 100 kev spectrum by the nearby a2440 cluster . hence we aimed at verifying whether a reflection component was required by the epic spectra as well .",
    "the quality of the fit improved after the inclusion of this component in the first model ( @xmath30 ) . however , the normalization of the reflection component was unusually large ( r@xmath315 ) and a power - law photon index still hard(@xmath32 ) .",
    "as a strong reflected component can mimic an absorbed power - law , a different model was tried .",
    "we tried to fix the relative normalization of the reflection component to the best - fit value measured by bepposax , and added a second power - law , with same spectral slope as that first model , screened by a different absorbing column density .",
    "the fit improved again ( @xmath33 for a decrease by 1 in the number of degrees of freedom ) the photon index is not flat anymore ( @xmath34 ) , and closer to typically observed values . in this scenario ,",
    "a column density @xmath35 @xmath14 obscures @xmath36 of the hard continuum , whereas the remaining @xmath37 of the nuclear radiation is seen through less thick material , with @xmath38 @xmath14 .",
    "the equivalent width of the neutral or mildly ionized iron k@xmath39 fluorescent emission line , @xmath40  ev , is in agreement with asca and bepposax results ( sambruna et al .",
    "1998 , grandi et al . 2006 , dadina 2007 ) . as already suggested by wozniak et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the cold gas covering the nuclear region is probably the source of the fe k@xmath39 line .",
    "the fe equivalent width of @xmath41 ev is indeed in good agreement with the predictions of ghisellini haardt & matt ( 1994 ) , who simulated the contribution of circumnuclear ( toroidal ) matter to the x - ray spectrum of seyferts .",
    "thus , assuming a keplerian motion of the obscuring matter and a black hole mass of @xmath42 m@xmath43 ( bettoni et al .",
    "2003 ) , the intrinsic width of the fe line provides a rough estimate of the torus location @xmath44 cm . taking into account the @xmath45 uncertainties",
    ", we estimate that the torus distance can not be smaller than 0.02 pc and larger than 0.7 pc .",

    "interestingly enough , the best - fit centroid energy of the ovii h-@xmath73 triplet components is blue - shifted by @xmath74  km  s@xmath5 , suggesting that the line emitting gas is outflowing ( the typical statistical uncertainties on the rgs aspect solutions are @xmath31100  km  s@xmath5 at this wavelength ) .",
    "however , this shift is not confirmed in the lower statistical quality oviii ly-@xmath73 line .",
    "although it is potentially possible that ovii and oviii transitions are emitted in dynamically separated  phases of the photoionized gas , we still consider the evidence for outflowing gas in the nuclear environment of 3c  445 as tentative , to be confirmed by future , more accurate measurements .    a handful of fe - l transitions",

    "the detection of the he - like oxygen triplet @xmath75 component is a clear indication for a photoionized plasma .",
    "however , given the low significance of the detection , quantitative plasma diagnostics based on the triplet component intensity ratios @xcite are partly ambiguous",
    ". only lower limits can be derived for the @xmath29 ( @xmath76 ) and @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) .",

    "the values derived from the rgs spectrum of 3c  445 ( @xmath81 ; @xmath82  erg  s@xmath5 ) place 3c  445 in the plane region preferentially occupied by obscured agn .",
    "although 3c445 is optically classified as blrg , its x - ray spectrum is similar to that observed in seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "the nuclear continuum is absorbed and the soft excess is well fitted by a weak power law plus emission lines .",
    "the hard x - ray emission is attenuated by a complex absorber with 70@xmath83 of the nuclear continuum absorbed by a column density of @xmath84 @xmath1 ( first component ) and @xmath37 by a smaller column of @xmath85 @xmath1 ( second component ) .",
    "about @xmath86 is attenuated only by the galactic @xmath87 ( third component ) .",
    "these results can be most straightforwardly interpreted using an analogy with typical spectra of radio - quiet obscured agn .",
    "a torus obscures the nuclear continuum ( first component ) that is probably associated to an accretion flow , while ionized gas , produces the soft lines and , acting as a mirror , scatters the x - ray continuum ( third component ) towards the observer beyond the outer rim of the torus .",
    "the origin of the second component is less obvious . considering that 3c445 is a powerful radio galaxy",
    ", it seems natural to associate it to a jet .",
    "if this is the case , the strength of the non - thermal beamed radiation ( second component ) is smaller than the accretion flow ( first component ) by a factor @xmath88 in the 2 - 10 kev band . in spite of the apparent agreement with the results of grandi @xmath89 palumbo ( 2007 ) , who have attempted a first separation between the nuclear jet and disk in three blrgs ( 3c120 , 3c382 and 3c390.3 ) , the hypothesis is not completely convincing . from the radio flux ratio of the approaching and receding jets ( leahy et al 1997 )",
    ", we can obtain an estimate of the jet inclination , @xmath90 .",
    "this is a rather large value if compared for example , with 3c120 and 3c390.3 that show inclination angle less than 14@xmath6 and 33@xmath6 , respectively ( eracleous & halpern 1999 ) .",
    "although a large angle of view in 3c 445 justifies its strong nuclear absorption , it does not justify the intense luminosity of the putative jet .",
    "an inclination of @xmath91 implies a small doppler factor @xmath92^{-1}$ ] , being @xmath93 and @xmath94 the bulk velocity in unit of c ] and , as a consequence a reduced flux amplification ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "if the analogy with the other blrgs is correct , in 3c 445 the jet / disk ratio should be smaller at least by a factor ten .",
    "alternatively , the second component could be disk radiation scattered within the torus and seen through the thinner layers of the obscuring matter .",
    "if the gas distribution in the circumnuclear region indeed resembles that expected in seyfert  2 galaxies , we could be looking at nuclear region through a not uniform absorber ( turner et al .",
    "1998 , weaver et al . 1999 ) with denser layers near the equatorial plane ( matt et al . 2000 ) .",
    "accordingly to the model proposed for the broad line region , one could think that the inner walls of the torus are responsible for the scattered light . in this case",
    "the scattering region should be completely ionized in order to act as a mirror .",
    "although plausible , this interpretation can not completely explain the luminosity of the second component .",
    "the ratio between direct and scattered radiation f=@xmath96 is expressed as a function of the solid angle subtended by the scattering source and the thompson depth f@xmath97 . even assuming that all the scattered light is seen by the observer through the thinner edge ( i.e. that we have a direct view of the equatorial plane ) , with a column density @xmath98 @xmath1 , the scattered radiation is less than 10@xmath83 .",
    "another appealing interpretation involves photoionized gas within the blr . in this case",
    "the scattered radiation should be observed through the same gas / dust layer which obscures the blr , assuming large dust grains in the circumnuclear agn clouds ( maiolino et al 2001a , 2001b ) to reconcile the the discrepancy between the estimated @xmath99 and the observed low reddening of the blr .",
    "the idea that electron scattering can occur in blr has been proposed in the past to explain the large wings observed in the optical lines . very recently ,",
    "laor ( 2007 ) , analyzing high quality keck observations of ngc4395 , has shown that the h@xmath73 exponential wings can be actually produced within the blr gas if @xmath100 .",
    "however this argument is still controversial .",
    "although it seems plausible that @xmath101 , the real value of the electron scattering depth is still very uncertain .    in the case of 3c 445 , @xmath101 requires a solid angle subtended by the blr @xmath102 in order to deviate towards the observer @xmath37 of the primary radiation .",
    "if the semi - aperture angle of the torus is equal to the inclination angle @xmath103 , the estimated solid angle @xmath104 is quite similar to that required to account for f=@xmath96 .",
    "however , if @xmath105 is significantly smaller , for example it is near to the value proposed by laor ( 2007 ) , the high ratio between direct and scattered radiation observed in 3c 445 requires a larger solid angle for the blr or an additional source of photons ( for example , the inner wall of the torus ) .",
    "thanks to the unprecedented combination of energy resolution and sensitivity of the rgs detector , the nature of the soft excess has been resolved in 3c  445 for the first time .",
    "the rgs continuum exhibit typical features of seyfert  2 spectra . based on the bianchi & guainazzi ( 2007 ) diagnostic plane",
    ", we argue that the emission lines originate in a warm gas photoionized by the nuclear engine .",
    "the same material is most likely responsible for scattering some of the nuclear flow toward the observer . indeed",
    "the ratio between the flux of the scattered and primary power law is @xmath106 per cent , in very good agreement with typical values observed in seyfert 2 galaxies ( mulchaey et al .",
    "1993 , turner et al . 1997 ; bianchi , private communication ) .",
    "since the ionized material is only attenuated by galactic n@xmath107 , it is natural to put it outside the torus and well beyond the blr .",
    "the scattering / emitting gas could indeed coincide with the narrow line region , as recently suggested for seyfert 2 galaxies by bianchi , guainazzi & chiaberge ( 2006 ) on the base of the impressive morphological similarity between chandra and narrow - band hst images of 8 sources .",
    "considering the strong similarity between seyfert 2s and 3c 445 ( scattered continuum and emission lines ) , a non thermal origin of the soft x - ray continuum appears very improbable .",
    "the contribution of an extra nuclear jet to the spectrum below 2 kev , if present , has to be however marginal .",
    "the detection of warm photo - ionized gas in the nuclear regions of radio galaxies is , in some regards , unexpected .",
    "since asca , it is well known that warm gas , producing characteristic absorption spectral features , is present in the inner region of seyferts . on the contrary , up to now",
    ", the only cold absorber has been unambiguously revealed in radio loud agn .",
    "this result is very important and needs to be consolidated by large sample analysis .",
    "we note in passing that , if confirmed , it would support the ( still debated ) idea that soft x - ray deficit seen in a handful of high redshift ( z@xmath108 ) radio loud quasars is due to warm gas ( worsley et al .",
    "2004 , yuan et al .",
    "it is indeed plausible that warm absorber seen in face - on sources is the same material that scatters nuclear x - rays into our line of sight in sources at larger inclination angle .",
    "* an xmm - newton observation of the blrg 3c 445 reveals its hidden seyfert 2 nature .",
    "* for the first time the soft excess of 3c 445 is resolved .",
    "it is well fitted with highly ionized lines over - imposed to a weak continuum .",
    "warm possibly outflowing gas located well beyond the torus , is responsible for the observed features .",
    "the same emitting line gas deviates a fraction ( 3% ) of the primary x - ray continuum , escaping from the torus cone , towards the observer . *",
    "the emerging picture is coherent and does not require an extra - nuclear jet to explain the soft unabsorbed flux . * about @xmath109 of the nuclear hard continuum is dominated by an accretion flow radiation transmitted through a column density @xmath110 @xmath14 .",
    "the detected @xmath111 line has an equivalent width consistent with an origin in the line - of - sight absorber . about @xmath2 of the nuclear emission",
    "is absorbed by a more tenuous column density @xmath112 @xmath14 .",
    "* if the the observer has a deep view into the nucleus but near the edge of the torus , light scattered by the inner wall of the torus and/or by the blr region could ( at least in part ) account for the less absorbed nuclear component .",
