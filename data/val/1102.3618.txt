    "manifolds of calabi - yau type were defined in @xcite as compact complex manifolds of odd dimension whose middle dimensional hodge structure is similar to that of a calabi - yau threefold .",
    "certain manifolds of calabi - yau type were used in order to construct mirrors of rigid calabi - yau threefolds , and in several respects they behave very much like calabi - yau threefolds .",
    "this applies in particular to the cubic sevenfold , which happens to be the mirror of the so - called @xmath3-variety  a rigid calabi - yau threefold obtained as a desingularization of the quotient of a product of three fermat cubic curves by the group @xmath4 , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in some way , manifolds of calabi - yau type come just after manifolds of k3 type : manifolds of even dimension @xmath5 , whose middle dimensional hodge structure is similar to that of a k3 surface . for @xmath6 ,",
    "projective @xmath5-folds of k3 type seem to be scarce , but they are specially interesting in the fact that if one has a well - behaved family of @xmath7-cycles on the variety , then the abel - jacobi map produces a closed holomorphic two - form on the base of the family .",
    "this could be a method to construct new complex symplectic manifolds .",
    "indeed , examples suggest that these holomorphic forms tend to be as non - degenerate as they can , see e.g. @xcite . this is what we will check for the cubic sevenfold and its family of planes : since we start with a manifold of calabi - yau type , the abel - jacobi map will produce a holomorphic three - form on the corresponding fano variety , and we show that it is generically non - degenerate ( proposition [ nondeg3form ] ) , in a sense that we will make precise .",
    "then we will concentrate , for the remaining of the paper , on a phenomenon which was first observed in @xcite , and that we will study here in much more depth : one can construct manifolds of calabi - yau type as linear sections of the cayley plane , and this turns out to be again related to cubic sevenfolds .",
    "the _ cayley plane _ , which is homogeneous under @xmath0 , is the simplest of the homogeneous spaces of exceptional type .",
    "it has many beautiful geometric properties , in particular it supports a plane projective geometry , whose `` lines '' are eight dimensional quadrics .",
    "its minimal equivariant embedding is inside a projective space of dimension @xmath8 , in which its secant variety is an @xmath0-invariant cubic hypersurface that we call the _",
    "cartan cubic_. the cartan cubic is singular exactly along the cayley plane , so that its general linear section of dimension at most eight is smooth .",
    "we prove in proposition [ finiterep ] that a general cubic sevenfold @xmath2 can always be described as a linear section of the cartan cubic .",
    "moreover , there is , up to isomorphism , only finitely many such _ cartan representations_. using the plane projective geometry supported by the cayley plane we show that such a representation induces on @xmath2 a rank nine vector bundle @xmath9 with very nice properties : in particular , it is simple , infinitesimally rigid ( theorem [ rigidity ] ) and arithmetically cohen - macaulay ( proposition [ acm ] ) .",
    "kuznetsov observed in @xcite that the derived category of coherent sheaves on a smooth hypersurface contains , under some hypothesis on the dimension and the degree , a full subcategory which is a calabi - yau category , of smaller dimension than the hypersurface .",
    "in particular the derived category @xmath10 of our smooth cubic sevenfold contains a full subcategory @xmath11 which is calabi - yau of dimension three ( a `` _ non - commutative calabi - yau threefold _ '' ) .",
    "it turns out that @xmath12 and @xmath13 both define objects in @xmath11 , and these objects are spherical . as shown by seidel and thomas ,",
    "the corresponding spherical twists define auto - equivalences of @xmath11 ( corollary [ sphtwists ] ) . recall that @xmath10 itself is poor in symmetries , @xmath2 being fano . since @xmath11 is calabi - yau , its structure and its symmetries are potentially much richer .",
    "cartan representations of cubic sevenfolds are very similar to pfaffian representations of cubic fourfolds , which are linear sections of the secant cubic to the grassmannian @xmath14 .",
    "( there are nevertheless important differences , in particular a general cubic fourfold is _ not _ pfaffian . ) starting from a pfaffian representation , a classical construction consists in considering the orthogonal linear section of the dual grassmannian : this is a k3 surface of genus eight , whose derived category can be embedded inside the derived category of the fourfold @xcite .",
    "we expect something similar for a cartan representation of a general cubic sevenfold @xmath2 .",
    "the orthogonal linear section of the dual cayley plane is a fano sevenfold @xmath15 of index three .",
    "using the plane projective geometry supported by @xmath16 , we show that @xmath15 is birationally equivalent ( but not isomorphic ) to @xmath2 ( proposition [ tto ] ) .",
    "this is an analogue of the tregub - takeuchi birational equivalence between the general prime fano threefold of degree fourteen and the orthogonal cubic threefold , as we explain in a short appendix .",
    "we conjecture that an explicit subcategory @xmath17 of @xmath18 should be calabi - yau of dimension three , and should even be equivalent to @xmath11 .",
    "this would give rise to an isomorphism , very similar to the pfaffian - calabi - yau derived equivalence of @xcite , between two non - commutative calabi - yau threefolds , associated to two quite different sevenfolds of calabi - yau type .",
    "pfaffian fourfolds are famous examples of _ rational _ cubic fourfolds .",
    "we conclude the paper by showing ( theorem [ rational ] ) that eight dimensional linear sections of the cartan cubic give rise to rational cubic eightfolds ( but very non generic )",
    ". the main ingredient of the proof is the close connection between @xmath0 and @xmath19 , and the fact that the spinor varieties of @xmath19 have four dimensional linear sections which are varieties with one apparent double point .",
    "the very nice geometric and homological properties of pfaffian fourfolds thus seem to propagate in rather different ways to cubics of dimension seven or eight .",

    "here we shall see that on the 8-dimensional family @xmath20 of planes on the cubic sevenfold @xmath2 there exists a generically non - degenerate holomorphic 3-form @xmath21 .",
    "the existence of the form @xmath22 is based on the fact that the space @xmath23 is one - dimensional , and @xmath21 can be constructed for example by following the techniques from @xcite .",
    "this is an analog of the well - known observation about the cubic fourfold @xmath15 and its family of lines @xmath24 , due to beauville and donagi : the unique ( 3,1)-form ( up to scalars ) on the cubic fourfold @xmath15 yields a non - degenerate holomorphic 2-form on @xmath25 , thus establishing that @xmath25 is a holomorphic symplectic fourfold , see @xcite .",
    "the cubic sevenfold and its abel - jacobi mapping have been studied by albano and collino @xcite .",
    "it also appeared in the physics literature , since it was observed in @xcite that it could be considered as the mirror of a rigid calabi - yau threefold , obtained as the quotient of a product of three elliptic curves by some threefold symmetry group .    in @xcite we defined _ manifolds of calabi - yau type _ as compact complex manifolds @xmath2 of odd dimension @xmath26 such that :    1 .",
    "the middle dimensional hodge structure is numerically similar to that of a calabi - yau threefold , that is @xmath27 2 .   for any generator @xmath28",
    ", the contraction map @xmath29 is an isomorphism .",
    "the hodge numbers @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "it is a straightforward consequence of the description of the hodge structure of a smooth projective hypersurface in terms of its jacobian ring , that a smooth cubic sevenfold @xmath2 is a fano manifold of calabi - yau type .",
    "the relevant hodge numbers are @xmath32      our first interest in cubic sevenfolds stemmed from the fact that the equality @xmath33 looks very similar to the equality @xmath34 that holds for a smooth cubic fourfold @xmath15 .",
    "as we have already mentioned , it is a famous result of beauville and donagi @xcite that the fano fourfold @xmath24 of lines on the general cubic fourfold @xmath15 is a symplectic fourfold : it is endowed with a closed holomorphic two - form @xmath35 which is everywhere non - degenerate . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath36 is the family of lines on @xmath15 , with its projections @xmath37 and @xmath38 to @xmath24 and @xmath15 , then the natural map @xmath39 is an isomorphism .",
    "if now @xmath2 is a general cubic sevenfold in @xmath40 , then the fano variety @xmath41 of _ planes _ on @xmath2 is a smooth connected eightfold , and with the same notations as above , the map @xmath42 is an isomorphism @xcite .",
    "in particular @xmath43 , so that @xmath44 is endowed with a holomorphic three - form @xmath21 , which is closed by the results of @xcite . although @xmath44 is not a symplectic variety ( its canonical bundle is non - trivial ) , we have a partially similar result to the case of the cubic fourfold .",
    "[ nondeg3form ] let @xmath2 be a general cubic sevenfold , @xmath44 the eightfold of planes on @xmath2 , and @xmath21 a generator of @xmath45 .",
    "then @xmath21 is generically non - degenerate .    before proving this statement ,",
    "a few words of explanation are in order .",
    "indeed , if the concept of non - degeneracy is completely clear for two - forms , it is not for three - forms in general .",
    "the point here is that @xmath44 has dimension eight , so that @xmath21 is at each point of @xmath44 a three - form in eight variables .",
    "now , it is known that the space of skew - symmetric three forms in eight variables has a finite number of @xmath46-orbits , which were first classified by gurevich @xcite .",
    "in particular there is an open orbit @xmath47 , and @xmath21 can be defined as being non - degenerate at some point @xmath48 if @xmath49 following @xcite , we can describe the three - form in terms of the extension class @xmath50 defining the conormal exact sequence .",
    "its square is an element @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath48 be a general plane in @xmath2 .",
    "the normal bundle @xmath52 has rank five and determinant @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , the quotient @xmath54 can be interpreted as a global section @xmath55 of @xmath56 .",
    "we can thus define the composition @xmath57 once we identify @xmath58 with @xmath59 , this is precisely the three - form @xmath21 ( up to scalar ) and we can make an explicit local computation .",
    "so let @xmath60 be a direct sum decomposition such that the plane @xmath48 is the projectivization of @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath62 be coordinates on @xmath61 and @xmath63 be coordinates on @xmath64 .",
    "let @xmath65 be a cubic polynomial defining the hypersurface @xmath2 .",
    "the hypothesis that @xmath2 contains @xmath48 implies that @xmath66 can be written as @xmath67 for some quadratic forms @xmath68 .",
    "the normal bundle @xmath69 can be described as the set of sixtuples @xmath70 such that @xmath71 the space of global sections @xmath59 has then dimension eight if and only if any cubic form on @xmath61 can be written in the previous form , that is , @xmath72 for some linear forms @xmath73 . in the sequel",
    "we make a stronger assumption : we suppose that the quadrics @xmath74 are linearly independent",
    ". otherwise said , they define an isomorphism between @xmath64 and @xmath75 .",
    "this suggests to change our notation by identifying @xmath76 with pairs of integers @xmath77 from @xmath78 to @xmath79 , and letting @xmath80 .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath64 has a basis @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the set of sixtuples @xmath83 such that @xmath84 .",
    "an easy computation shows that @xmath85 is the copy of @xmath86 generated by the global section @xmath87 of @xmath88 , which never vanishes .",
    "note that the map @xmath54 induces a map from @xmath89 to @xmath90 , mapping the class @xmath91 to the class @xmath92 of the extension @xmath93 this allows to compute our three - form on @xmath59 as the composition @xmath94 let us find a cech representative of @xmath92 relative to the canonical affine covering of @xmath48 . on @xmath95 ,",
    "the section @xmath96 yields a splitting of @xmath97 , which implies that @xmath92 is defined by the cech cocycle @xmath98 the symmetric square of @xmath92 in @xmath99 is defined by the cech cocycle @xmath100 let now @xmath101 be three global sections of @xmath52 .",
    "for example , we can identify @xmath102 with a traceless matrix @xmath103 of order three , in such a way that , as a global section of @xmath104 , @xmath105 then our three form @xmath106 on @xmath59 maps @xmath107 to the cech cocycle of @xmath108 defined by @xmath109 , which can be written , when considered as a rational section of @xmath110 , as a multiple of @xmath111 by some rational function having poles at most along the three coordinate hyperplanes . since @xmath112 defines a cocycle generating @xmath113 , while any other monomial ( with exponents in @xmath114 )",
    "is a coboundary , we deduce the identity @xmath115 at that point the simplest thing to do is an explicit computation : we find , in terms of the linear forms @xmath116 on @xmath117 taking the values of the @xmath118-entries ( so that @xmath119 ) : @xmath120 in which we easily recognize the unique invariant three - form on @xmath117 : @xmath121c).\\ ] ] any element in the stabilizer of @xmath106 clearly induces a lie algebra isomorphism of @xmath117 .",
    "this stabilizer is thus locally isomorphic to @xmath122 . in particular",
    "it has dimension @xmath123 , hence codimension @xmath124 in @xmath125 .",
    "but @xmath124 is also the dimension of @xmath126 , which shows that the @xmath125-orbit of the determinant is the open orbit @xmath127 of non - degenerate three - forms .    _",
    "remark_. following @xcite ( proposition 10 page 90 ) , the complement of @xmath127 is defined by a covariant of degree @xmath128 on @xmath129 .",
    "this covariant defines a map @xmath130 . since @xmath131 ,",
    "the degeneracy locus of the three - form @xmath21 is a sextic hypersurface in @xmath25 .",
    "by a result of l. hesse from 1844 the homogeneous form defining a smooth plane cubic can be represented in three non - equivalent ways as a determinant of a symmetric @xmath132 matrix with linear entries , see @xcite . by a later construction of a. dixon ( 1902 ) ,",
    "the representations of the equation of a plane curve as a symmetric determinant correspond to its non - effective theta - characteristics , see @xcite or  4 in @xcite . by other classical results originating from a. clebsch ( 1866 ) , a smooth cubic surface @xmath133 has exactly @xmath134 determinantal representations , i.e. the cubic form @xmath135 of @xmath136 has @xmath134 non - equivalent representations as a determinant of a @xmath132 matrix @xmath137 with linear entries , see @xcite or cor.6.4 in @xcite .    what about cubics of higher dimensions ?",
    "the determinantal cubics of dimensions @xmath138 are singular , but one can nevertheless proceed by replacing determinantal by pfaffian representations , i.e. representations as pfaffians of skew - symmetric matrices of order @xmath139 with linear entries . it has been found essentially in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and restated in this form in @xcite , that the general cubic threefold @xmath15 has a family of pfaffian representations which is 5-dimensional and birational to the intermediate jacobian of @xmath15 . as for cubic fourfolds , it is well - known that the general cubic fourfold is not pfaffian . for cubics of higher dimensions",
    "the situation is even worse  while the general pfaffian cubic fourfold is still smooth ( and rational ! ) the pfaffian cubics of dimension greater than five are singular , and the question is which generalization of the pfaffian , if any , can represent cubics of higher dimensions .    looking back , we see that the spaces of symmetric @xmath132 matrices , matrices of order 3 , and skew - symmetric matrices of order 6 are in fact the first three of a series of four jordan algebras  they are the algebras of hermitian matrices over the composition algebras @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "then , writing - down a cubic form @xmath44 as a symmetric determinant , as a determinant , or as a pfaffian is the same as giving a presentation of the cubic @xmath143 as a linear section of the determinant in the jordan algebra over @xmath140 , @xmath141 or @xmath142 .",
    "what is left is the fourth jordan algebra  the space of hermitian @xmath132 matrices over the cayley algebra @xmath144 of octonions .",
    "the octonionic determinant is a special @xmath0-invariant cubic in @xmath1  the cartan cubic which is singular in codimension 9 .",
    "therefore we can ask about representations of the smooth cubics @xmath2 as linear sections of the cartan cubic upto dimension 8 .",
    "we call them the _ cartan _ representations of @xmath2 .",
    "as we show below , the general cubic sevenfold is a section of the cartan cubic in a finite number of ways , and by this property it looks similar to the cubic curve and the cubic surface .",
    "but while the numbers of determinantal representations as above of cubic curves and of cubic surfaces are known since hesse and clebsch , the number of cartan representations of the general cubic sevenfold remains an unsolved question .",
    "let @xmath144 denote the normed algebra of real octonions ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and let @xmath145 be its complexification .",
    "the space @xmath146 of @xmath145-hermitian matrices of order @xmath79 , is traditionally known as the _ exceptional simple jordan algebra _ , for the jordan multiplication @xmath147 .",
    "the automorphism group of this jordan algebra is an algebraic group of type @xmath148 , and preserves the determinant @xmath149 where the term @xmath150 makes sense uniquely , despite the lack of associativity of @xmath145 .",
    "the subgroup of @xmath151 consisting of automorphisms preserving this cubic polynomial is the adjoint group of type @xmath0 .",
    "the jordan algebra @xmath152 and its dual are the minimal ( non - trivial and irreducible ) representations of this group .",
    "an equation of the invariant cubic hypersurface was once written down by elie cartan in terms of the configuration of the @xmath153 lines on a smooth cubic surface",
    ". we will call it the _ cartan cubic_.    the action of @xmath0 on the projectivization @xmath154 has exactly three orbits : the complement of the determinantal hypersurface @xmath155 , the regular part of this hypersurface , and its singular part which is the closed @xmath0-orbit .",
    "these three orbits can be considered as the ( projectivizations of the ) sets of matrices of rank three , two , and one respectively .",
    "the closed orbit , corresponding to rank one matrices , is called the _ cayley plane _ and denoted @xmath16 ( the reasons for this notation and terminology will soon be explained ) .",
    "it can be defined by the quadratic equation @xmath156 it will be useful to notice that a dense open subset can be parametrized explicitly as the set of matrices of the form @xmath157 the cayley plane can also be identified with the quotient of @xmath0 by the maximal parabolic subgroup @xmath158 defined by the simple root @xmath159 corresponding to the end of one the long arms of the dynkin diagram ( we follow the notations of @xcite ) . the semi - simple part of this maximal parabolic is isomorphic to @xmath160 .",

    "in particular the orbits inside @xmath154 and @xmath168 are isomorphic ( although non - equivariantly ) , and the closed orbit @xmath169 inside @xmath170 is again a copy of the cayley plane .",
    "we denote it by @xmath171 and call it the _ dual cayley plane_.    the cartan cubic inside @xmath170 can be described either as the projective dual variety to the cayley plane , or as the secant variety to the dual cayley plane . as a secant variety ,",
    "it is degenerate , and therefore any point @xmath37 of the open orbit in @xmath170 defines a positive dimensional _ entry locus _ in the dual cayley plane ( the trace on @xmath171 of the secants through @xmath37 , see e.g. @xcite for background and more details on severi varieties ) .",

    "now , ( [ pdet ] ) shows that @xmath172 belongs to @xmath485 if and only if @xmath489 and @xmath490 if @xmath491 , these conditions imply that @xmath492 and @xmath493 , so that in fact @xmath494 . generically , this can not happen in our situation since this would imply that @xmath172 belongs to the linear span of @xmath452 , which is too small to meet @xmath198 .",
    "so we must let @xmath495 , in which case we are left with the conditions @xmath496",
    "as we have just seen , this defines a copy of @xmath482 . since the parameters @xmath497 remain free , we conclude that @xmath172 must belong to the join of @xmath482 with a @xmath428 . cutting this join with @xmath198 amounts to cut @xmath482 along a generic three dimensional linear section , which is a prime fano threefold of degree @xmath441 .",

    "a nice consequence is that theorem [ rigidity ] can now be interpreted as the assertion that @xmath12 and @xmath13 are _ spherical objects _ in @xmath11 , in the sense of seidel and thomas @xcite .",
    "in particular , with their notations and terminology :    [ sphtwists ] the spherical twists @xmath500 and @xmath501 are auto - equivalences of @xmath11 .",
    "these auto - equivalences have infinite order .",
    "this can be seen at the level of k - theory : the k - theory of @xmath11 is free of rank two , hence has a basis given by the classes of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",

    "starting once again from a cartan representation @xmath446 of a smooth cubic sevenfold , we would like to compare the derived category of @xmath2 with that of the orthogonal section @xmath447 , that we suppose to be smooth as well .",

    "use the koszul complex describing @xmath514 and apply bott s theorem on the cayley plane .",
    "more precisely , use lemma 1 and lemma 3 in @xcite .",
    "it is then tempting to consider the right orthogonal @xmath17 in @xmath18 to this exceptional collection and ask :    * is @xmath17 a three - dimensional calabi - yau category ? * is @xmath17 equivalent to @xmath11 ?",
    "note that if @xmath2 has @xmath515 cartan representations , the corresponding orthogonal sections @xmath516 would define non - commutative fourier partners to the non - commutative calabi - yau threefold @xmath11 .",
    "_ remark_. it follows from the results of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 4 ) that @xmath517 belongs to @xmath17 .",

    "contrary to cubic sevenfolds , an eight dimensional linear section of the cartan cubic can not be a general cubic eightfold .",

    "the cartan cubic eightfold is the octonionic analog of the pfaffian cubic fourfold , the last corresponding to the quaternions .",

    "for example , a smooth cubic surface @xmath136 is rational because it contains space cubic curves , or pairs of non intersecting lines , which are examples of voadp .    by @xcite any smooth cubic",

    "the singular cubic hypersurfaces in any dimension are evidently rational .",
    "the general pfaffian cubic 4-fold @xmath2 is smooth and rational since @xmath2 contains quintic del pezzo surfaces and rational quartic scrolls , which are other examples of voadp ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    other interesting series of examples of smooth rational cubic fourfolds have been found by hassett @xcite , but as far as we know , until now the only examples of smooth rational cubic hypersurfaces of dimension @xmath532 are of even dimension @xmath5 and contain a voadp .",
    "one delicate part in these examples is the proof that a general cubic @xmath5-fold through a particular kind of voadp is indeed smooth .",
    "moreover the examples of @xmath524-dimensional voadp are not too many ( see @xcite ) , which seems to be one more reason why there are very few known examples of rational smooth cubic @xmath5-folds of dimension bigger than four ( see e.g. @xcite for a modern treatment of fano s results on pfaffian cubic fourfolds and for examples of smooth cubic sixfolds containing a @xmath79-dimensional voadp ) .",
    "we shall see below that the general cartan cubic @xmath123-fold @xmath2 contains a @xmath533-dimensional voadp @xmath15 , which implies that @xmath2 is rational .",

    "it also contains the image @xmath564 of the lie algebra @xmath565 , obtained by differentiating the restriction of @xmath106 to @xmath566 .",
    "so we just need to prove that @xmath557 and @xmath564 do span @xmath556 , which is equivalent to the fact that the quotient map @xmath567 is surjective .    to check this ,",

    "it is obviously surjective , hence we are done .",
