    "in a recent paper , presented a coupled continuum field formulation for the interaction of electric effects , mechanical response and self - diffusion .",
    "their approach drew upon earlier work by larch and cahn  @xcite , nix and co - workers  @xcite , gnin  @xcite , bower and freund  @xcite , to name but a few . in reference",
    "@xcite , a review of these works and others was presented , computational techniques were developed based on the finite element method , and several initial and boundary value problems involving diffusional creep ( nabarro - herring and coble creep ) were solved .",
    "the formulation introduced in  @xcite was extended to interdiffusion , with dopants in silicon as motivation , by garikipati and bassman  @xcite . in the current paper , we present a further extension of that same formulation to account for the interaction of grain - boundary migration with stress - driven self - diffusion and electromigration in polycrystalline solids .",
    "different strategies used to model grain - boundary motion in a computational setting are described in the literature .",
    "sun and suo  @xcite developed a two - dimensional finite element formulation , based on the idea that the energy dissipated during the motion of the boundary must equal the reduction in the free energy of the system .",
    "this formulation was used to study several problems including grain growth in a thin film and the competition between surface grooving and grain - boundary migration .",
    "a similar variational formulation was developed by cocks and gill  @xcite and used to model the evolution of a large network of grains in two dimensions .",
    "another model was developed by , based on the variational formulation of reitich and soner  @xcite and using the level set method of osher and sethian  @xcite .",
    "the level set method is also used in the present paper as an interface - capturing technique . however , the goal of the current work is not merely to simulate grain - boundary motion , but to capture fully the interaction between this motion and other microscale phenomena that take place in pure polycrystalline materials , namely stress - mediated self - diffusion and electromigration .",
    "this distinguishes the current work from the existing literature .    in the current work",
    ", we recast the level - set equation in a simpler form by assuming that the level - set function remains a signed distance to the migrating grain boundary ( as with the original level - set equation , the use of an extensional velocity field helps maintain this signed - distance function ) . tested the resulting level - set formulation extensively and concluded that it is both accurate and robust despite its remarkable simplicity ( for some interface - evolution problems",
    ", this approach reduces the original level - set equation , a nonlinear hyperbolic pde , to an ode that is almost trivial to solve ) .",
    "they conducted several numerical experiments to assess the ability of the simplified level - set scheme to capture the correct solution , particularly in the presence of discontinuities in the extensional velocity and/or in the gradient of the level - set function .",
    "they also examined the convergence properties of the method and its performance in a variety of problems , including curvature flow and problems where the simplified level - set equation takes the form of a hamilton - jacobi equation with convex or non - convex hamiltonian .",
    "discretizations based on structured and unstructured finite - element meshes of bilinear quadrilateral and linear triangular elements were shown to perform equally well .",
    "they also found that sufficient accuracy is available through a standard galerkin formulation without resorting to any stabilization or discontinuity - capturing @xcite techniques .",
    "in addition , a variant of the simplified level - set formulation mentioned above was employed by for representing the evolution of phase boundaries over unstructured finite - element meshes . here",
    ", we treat a complex coupled problem of which grain - boundary migration is only one facet , in addition to mechanics , self - diffusion and electromigration .",
    "we apply this simplified level - set scheme to the problem of grain - boundary migration within this context , and we demonstrate its implementation as an integral part of the wider computational framework used to solve the coupled problem under consideration .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : coup ] , we summarize the formulation for coupled mass transport and mechanics .",
    "then we examine the thermodynamics and kinetics of grain - boundary migration , and show how this phenomenon interacts with mass transport and mechanics in polycrystals . in section",

    "furthermore , information about the location of the boundary is needed to calculate the value of the vacancy formation energy , @xmath29 , and the activation energy for diffusion , @xmath77 , everywhere in the domain of interest .",
    "these properties are assumed to vary linearly over the width of a boundary region as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : interfaces ] .",
    "the foregoing illustrates the influence of grain - boundary migration on mass transport . due to the tight coupling between mass transport and mechanics",
    ", the migration of the grain boundary also affects the stress . in turn",
    ", mass transfer across the grain boundary causes one grain to grow at the expense of its neighbor and thus leads to grain - boundary migration .",

    "the thermodynamic driving force for such a process , acting on a unit area of the interface , is thus defined as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the increase in the total gibbs free energy of the system brought about by a motion of the interface , during which the interface sweeps through the volume @xmath80 . neglecting triple junctions ,",
    "the gibbs free energy of a polycrystal can be expressed as the sum of two contributions : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the gibbs free energy density as defined in ( [ eq : gib ] ) and @xmath83 is the energy per unit area of an interface , @xmath84 .",
    "the term _ interface _ is used here to refer to free surfaces as well as grain boundaries , and the summation in ( [ eq : m_gfe ] ) is over all such interfaces in the polycrystal .    in situations where the gibbs free energy density , @xmath82 , suffers a decrease across a grain boundary",
    ", the total free energy of the system can be reduced if the grain with the smaller value of @xmath82 ( evaluated at the grain boundary ) were to grow at the expense of its neighbor .",
    "thus , a driving force acts on the grain boundary . for example",
    ", during recrystallization , annealed grains grow at the expense of cold - worked grains in which large dislocation densities lead to high values of @xmath82 .",
    "the misorientation between two adjacent grains of an elastically anisotropic material subjected to a directional load causes one grain to store a smaller amount of strain energy per unit volume than its neighbor .",
    "this leads to strain - induced grain - boundary migration .",
    "electromigration also causes atoms to jump across grain boundaries and thus leads to the migration of these boundaries  @xcite .    under the current formulation",
    ", the driving force discussed above can be characterized as follows : when a single atom hops across the grain boundary , it exchanges positions with a vacancy .",
    "therefore , the volume change associated with this hopping event is .",
    "the decrease in the gibbs free energy of the system is equal to the difference in the chemical potential of atoms across the boundary ; i.e.  , or equivalently .",
    "hence , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : m_dforc ] ) , and assuming that the chemical potential gradient across the boundary is essentially linear  @xcite , the driving force , @xmath85 , can be expressed as @xmath86 where @xmath9 is the unit normal to the grain boundary and @xmath1 is its width .",
    "[ br]@xmath46 , due to surface tension , @xmath46.,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : m_gfe ] ) , it is clear that the total gibbs free energy of a polycrystal can also be lowered by decreasing the total surface area of the grain boundaries in the system .",
    "when a curved interface moves away from its center of curvature , sweeping through an increment of volume @xmath80 , the free energy of the system increases by @xmath87 where @xmath83 is the ( constant ) specific surface energy of the interface and @xmath88 and @xmath89 are its principal radii of curvature .",
    "this expression can be traced back to herring  @xcite .",
    "it follows that , in the current two - dimensional formulation , the driving force acting on a unit area of a ( cylindrical ) grain boundary , due to this effect , can be expressed as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the radius of curvature and the negative sign indicates that @xmath92 drives the boundary to migrate _ toward _ its center of curvature ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : m_pgamma ] ) . in a polycrystal comprising only annealed grains , the action of @xmath92 leads to normal grain growth ; i.e.  the growth of large grains at the expense of smaller ones .",
    "by contrast , in the early stages of recrystallization , small annealed grains grow at the expense of the surrounding matrix of cold - worked material .",
    "in this case , the boundaries surrounding the annealed grains move _ away _ from their respective centers of curvature under the effect of @xmath85 .      assuming that grain - boundary migration takes place as a result of individual atoms hopping across the boundary , the migration velocity can be expressed in the following form : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is in the direction of the local unit normal , @xmath9 , which is assumed to point away from the boundary s center of curvature and @xmath95 is the grain - boundary mobility .",
    "this classical result , derived by turnbull  @xcite using absolute reaction rate theory , holds provided that @xmath96 , a condition which is always met in grain growth and recrystallization  @xcite .",
    "the results of molecular dynamics simulations of curvature - driven  @xcite and strain - induced  @xcite grain - boundary migration in bicrystals agree with eq .",
    "( [ eq : m_kine ] ) , which can be modified as follows , to account for both types of driving forces discussed in section  [ sec : migr_theo_ther ] : @xmath97      in section  [ sec : migr_theo_ther ] , it was established that diffusion of atoms across a grain boundary due to the local gradient in the atomic chemical potential causes the boundary to migrate .",
    "the driving force for boundary migration in this case , denoted @xmath85 , is given by ( [ eq : m_pg ] ) .",
    "an expression for the corresponding mobility , @xmath98 , can be obtained by stipulating that , in this case , the migration velocity in the direction of the local unit normal , @xmath9 , should be given by ( see porter and easterling  @xcite ) @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are , respectively , the local atomic and vacancy fluxes .",
    "also recall that @xmath3 is the atomic volume and @xmath4 is the volume of a vacancy . since atoms and vacancies move by exchanging positions ; i.e.  @xmath102 , we have @xmath103 finally , by combining ( [ eq : m_mg2 ] ) , ( [ eq : m_pg ] ) and ( [ eq : flux0 ] ) , we obtain @xmath104 since grain - boundary migration under the sole influence of @xmath85 involves _ transport _ across the boundary , and since , in the present treatment , mass transport is assumed to take place through the exchange of positions between atoms and vacancies , no lattice sites are transferred across the boundary in this process .",
    "by contrast , migration under the influence of @xmath92 consists of the transfer of lattice sites across the grain boundary  @xcite , via the process of atoms detaching from one grain and attaching to the one on the opposite side of the boundary .",
    "it is hence unreasonable to expect the mobilities , @xmath98 and @xmath105 , of these two distinctly different processes to be the same .",
    "as mentioned earlier , normal grain growth can be attributed to the action of the driving force @xmath92 .",
    "the fact that grain growth is a thermally activated process suggests an arrhenius - type relationship between the mobility , @xmath105 , and the temperature : @xmath106 where the pre - exponential factor , @xmath107 , and the activation energy for grain - boundary migration , @xmath108 , are dependent on the misorientation angle and the axis of rotation  @xcite .    finally , by combining ( [ eq : m_force2d ] ) , ( [ eq : m_kine2 ] ) , ( [ eq : m_mg2 ] ) and ( [ eq : m_tempdep1 ] ) , we obtain the following expression for the migration velocity : @xmath109",

    "this computational framework is based on an operator - split solution scheme and relies on the finite element method to solve the mechanics , mass - transport and electric - flow problems individually .",
    "while reference  @xcite addresses mainly the physics of stress - driven mass transport in polycrystals , it also contains details of the computational framework used therein . here , these details are omitted ; however , the operator - split solution scheme is outlined briefly in section  [ sec : stagg ] to show how the level - set formulation is incorporated into the computational framework used .",

    "it is clear that a strong vacancy flux exists in the vicinity of the grain boundary . a vector plot of the vacancy - flux field in the neighborhood of the grain boundary is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m_vecflux ] and although the field is complicated in this neighborhood , it can be seen that vacancies tend to drift in the same direction as the migrating boundary , thus preventing the appearance of a ` trail ' of vacancies or other oscillations in the numerical solution in the boundary s wake .",
    "it is important to note that the flux field evolves continually as the boundary migrates .",
    "it is also notable that the formulation captured this aspect of the coupling between mass transport and grain - boundary migration without additional terms being added to the expression of the vacancy flux to account , specifically , for the effect of moving boundaries .",
    "the second example is concerned with the case where a curved grain boundary evolves into a planar configuration to reduce the free energy of the system . here , the equilibrium angles at the grain boundary - sidewall intersections are set to @xmath205 and the initial geometry of the boundary is different and less regular than in the first example .",

    "the coupled continuum formulation presented here was developed to model stress - driven self - diffusion and electromigration in polycrystals while accounting fully for the interaction between these mass transfer processes and the motion of grain boundaries .",
    "the formulation accounts for two distinct thermodynamic driving forces acting on a grain boundary ; one due to the boundary s own curvature and another engendered by mass transfer across the boundary via stress - driven self - diffusion and electromigration . +",
    "the level set method has _",
    "previously _ been used to pose grain - boundary migration as a time - dependent field problem governed by a pure advection equation .",
    "standard numerical schemes resort to spatial stabilization techniques ( e.g.  upwinding schemes , galerkin / least - squares ) to attenuate the spurious oscillations known to appear in the numerical solution of equations of this type . here , on the other hand , the level - set equation is reduced , using the mathematical properties of signed distance functions and extensional velocity fields , to a simpler form which obviates the need for these stabilization techniques .",
    "this leads to a remarkably simple explicit scheme for advancing the solution in time .",
    "the algorithm used to construct the extensional velocity field  and to simultaneously re - initialize the level - set field  is presented .",
    "we also provide the description of an @xmath158-projection technique used to compute the curvature of the grain boundary .",
    "the numerical examples presented indicate that the strong coupling in the problem is captured adequately and that the numerical implementation allows the solution of the coupled initial and boundary value problem to be advanced in time in a stable fashion to obtain physically meaningful results .",
