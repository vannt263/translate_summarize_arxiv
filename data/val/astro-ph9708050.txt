    "the first x - ray spectra of high z quasars showed strong , unanticipated , low energy cut - offs ( elvis et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "a tantalizing connection of these cut - offs with gps quasars was also suggested , raising the possibility that these cut - offs were due to hot , galaxy - scale , medium that also confined the radio sources .",
    "if nuclear absorbing material produces the cut - offs a different environment must be common at high redshifts .",
    "we have now investigated these cut - offs further .    in the first paper in this series ( fiore et al .",
    "1996 , paper i ) we used the pspc soft x - ray slope ( @xmath1 ) derived from the rosat pointed pspc database ( using ` wgacat ' , white , giommi & angelini 1995 ) and found the following results :    \\(1 ) radio - loud quasars have x - ray colors which differ ( @xmath2=1% ) from those of radio - quiet quasars .",
    "most of these lie in the zone indicating a low energy x - ray cut - off . in order to affect radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars differently",
    ", these cut - offs must be associated with the quasars , and not with intervening systems .",
    "spectral fits ( paper i ) to the better signal - to - noise pspc spectra give more confidence that absorption is at work .",
    "three levels of confidence in the presence of a low energy x - ray cut - off were defined ( table 1 ) : ` a ' : five quasars require ( at @xmath399.9% confidence ) absorption in a power - law plus absorption model .",
    "3c  109 also shows excess absorption ( allen & fabian 1992 ) , but was excluded from our initial search because it had too large a galactic column density . since it has interesting properties (  2 , 4 ) we include it for comparison with the other objects . `",
    "b ' : in five more quasars , the fit suggests absorption but less strongly ( at @xmath395% confidence ) .",
    "` c ' : in three quasars either absorption or an extremely flat spectrum ( @xmath4 0.25 ) is required .",
    "absorption is thus a good working hypothesis to explain the low energy x - ray cut - offs in this sample of 13 quasars .",
    "absorption only in radio - loud quasars implies that radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars environments must differ at high z. agreement of the results of paper i with other rosat and asca work is good ( paper i ) .",
    "\\(2 ) among the radio - loud quasars , those at high redshift have a lower mean @xmath1 than those at low redshift ( p=0.04% ) , due to those lying in the x - ray ` cut - off ' zone .",
    "a partial correlation analysis shows that the change in @xmath1 is a redshift , and not a luminosity , effect .",
    "the x - ray cut - offs , and so presumably the quasar environments , thus show evolution with cosmic epoch .",
    "if the cut - offs are due to photoelectric absorption then the x - ray column densities of @xmath5  @xmath6 are implied at the quasar .",
    "the small range of observed values is probably induced by the spectral range of rosat , limiting effective observed cut - off energies to the range @xmath70.5 - 1.5  kev .",
    "an instrument covering both higher and lower energies , with sufficient sensitivity , is needed to find the true range of cut - offs in high z quasars .",
    "an absorbing column density of this size will produce observable effects at other wavelengths . for standard galactic dust composition and dust - to - gas ratio ( jenkins & savage 1974 ) strong reddening ( @xmath8 ) is predicted .",
    "neutral material would show strong hydrogen absorption in a damped lyman-@xmath9 system .",
    "ionized material instead will show absorption lines from other ions , e.g. civ , ovi ( c.f .",
    "ngc  5548 , mathur , elvis & wilkes 1996 ) , unless the material is highly ionized ( or primordial ) .    in this paper",
    "we seek evidence from optical spectroscopy for or against absorption in the same sample .",
    "we use our positive findings to investigate the nature of the absorbers .",
    "we also examine the radio properties of the quasars . we assume a friedman cosmology with h@xmath10=50  km  s@xmath11  mpc@xmath11 and @xmath12=0 .",
    "to search for the predicted optical obscuration we have compiled data , from the literature , on absorption local to the quasars in our sample ( table 1 ) , using ned .",
    "seven of the quasars have optical spectra with adequate signal - to - noise and resolution to detect absorption lines within the broad emission lines .",
    "five of these show associated absorption lines ( table 1 ) , and two more have candidate systems at high @xmath0v .",
    "two other quasars have red optical continua ( table 1 ) .",
    "red continua , and absorption lines close to the emission line redshift , are quite rare and both suggest absorbing material near the quasar . hence , to find one or the other in 9 out of 11 x - ray cut - off quasars , strongly supports the interpretation of the x - ray cut - offs as due to absorption .",
    "four of the lowest redshift quasars are from the 3cr radio catalog .",
    "( 3c219 , once classified as a narrow line radio galaxy , is now known to have broad h-@xmath9 and paschen-@xmath9 emission lines , hill et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "three of the four have red continua ( @xmath13 , table 1 ) , which are found in some 15% of 3cr quasars",
    "( smith & spinrad 1980 ) .",
    "the binomial probability of finding 3 red quasars in a sample of 4 by chance is 1% .",
    "we conclude that x - ray cut - offs and red continua are linked",
    ". the red color of these quasars could be due to an intrinsic spectral shape ( wills et al . , 1995 )",
    ", as in some blazars ( giommi , ansari & micol , 1996 )",
    ". however we have additional evidence that in these objects the steep slope is almost certainly due to reddening by dust : 3c  219 has paschen-@xmath9/h-@xmath9/h-@xmath14 emission line ratios that imply @xmath15=1.8@xmath160.3 ( hill et al . , 1996 ) , consistent with the x - ray column density ( allen & fabian 1992 ) ; 3c  109 has a polarized optical spectrum that shows broad lines , as in ngc  1068 , implying @xmath17 2.7 ( goodrich & cohen , 1984 ) . for the continuum of 3c  212 to be a reddened version of a normal quasar requires the similar reddening ( a@xmath18=2.8 ) implied from the observed x - ray cut - off ( a@xmath195.5 , for a milky way dust to gas ratio , savage & mathis 1979 ) .",

    "this would strongly indicate quite core - dominated objects , probably dominated by relativistic beaming .",
    "however both compact steep spectrum ( css ) and gigahertz peaked spectrum ( gps ) sources have large @xmath27 based on 1  arcsec , vla style , maps .",
    "the small size of their lobes , which dominate their radio emission , leads to a misleadingly large @xmath27 .",
    "closer examination is needed .",

    "we conclude that photoelectric absorption by the same obscuring material is the cause of the x - ray cut - offs .",
    "the redshifts of the optical lines relative to the quasar emission redshift can suggest a site for the absorbers .",
    "velocities within 2000  km  s@xmath11 of the emission redshift ( pks  2351@xmath24154 , 3c  207 , 3c  212 , table 1 ) can arise due to motions within a surrounding cluster of galaxies .",
    "they could also be due to material at rest in the host galaxy since the redshift of the high ionization emission lines typically differ systematically from the host redshift by about this amount ( @xmath31 , tytler & fan , 1992 ) .",
    "larger velocities are most plausibly associated with motions connected to the active nucleus itself , since the velocities needed are clearly present in agn : the widths of the broad emission lines are 5000 - 10,000  km  s@xmath11 , and velocities within jets approach @xmath32 . absorbers with large @xmath33 probably indicate outflows ( pks  2126 - 158 , pks  0537@xmath24286 ) .",
    "good optical spectra for the rest of the sample would help decide which type of system is the more common .",
    "the objects divide into at least two groups , which may not share a common cause for the observed absorption .",
    "the high ionization absorber in the high redshift quasars and in 3c  207 have features in common .",
    "the three other 3c quasars form a separate group of heavily obscured objects ( see  2 ) .",
    "if the absorbers in the red 3c agn are unrelated to the rest , then these others will show even stronger evolution with redshift than derived in paper  i.    3c  109 resembles a seyfert 2 , in which a nuclear torus , viewed edge - on , obscures the broad emission line region and continuum source ( e.g. urry & padovani 1995 ) , since 3c  109 has a polarized optical spectrum showing a normal broad emission line quasar spectrum ( goodrich & cohen , 1992 ) , as does that of the prototype seyfert  2 galaxy , ngc  1068 ( antonucci & miller 1985 ) .",
    "the 3c quasars in this sample are all large ( @xmath7100  kpc ) diameter radio sources with simple , quasi - power - law spectra , and so could well be viewed close to edge - on .",
    "the tori in these luminous ( @xmath34 ) radio - loud agn may be larger than in seyferts , though .",
    "mathur ( 1994 ) notes for 3c  212 that the dust must lie @xmath310  pc from the quasar continuum source in order not to evaporate ( t@xmath351750  k ) .",
    "3c  109 and 3c  219 have similar luminosities and so the dust must be similarly distant .",
    "this distance is about 100 times the broad emission line region ( belr ) radius for this luminosity ( @xmath7 100  light - days , kaspi et al .",
    "a closer equivalent situation may be the ionized absorbers in seyfert galaxies .",
    "these are , marginally , consistent with being at a similarly large relative distance from the belr ( mathur , elvis & wilkes 1996 ) and so could be due to the same phenomenon . if however infrared measurements show that much of the dust is colder , and so more distant ( elvis et al . , 1984 ) , or if absorption line variability is faster in seyferts ( requiring a denser absorber closer to the continuum source ) , then a new type of absorber may be needed for the 3c absorbers . in 3c  212 the x - ray absorber is partially ionized ( mathur 1996 ) . such dusty , ionized absorbers are common in seyfert galaxies ( reynolds 1996 ) .    the absorbers in the higher redshift , higher luminosity quasars , and in 3c  207 , all",
    "show high ionization .",
    "similar absorbers are known in seyfert galaxies ( e.g. mathur , elvis & wilkes 1996 ) . the high velocity associated absorber in q  2343 + 125 ( hamman et al . , 1997 )",
    "has high ionization , and the authors suggest a link with the broad absorption line quasars that may apply here too . to have significant fractional ionization in civ ( @xmath36 ) requires an ionization parameter , @xmath37 , @xmath353 ( e.g. mathur , elvis & wilkes 1996 ) . with this @xmath37",
    "the x - ray continuum should recover to its unabsorbed level at energies below the oxygen k - edge .",
    "the ionization could be produced either by the quasars photoionizing continuum , or from the absorbing medium itself being hot ( t@xmath710@xmath38  k ) . in these high luminosity quasars ( @xmath39",
    ", vron - cetty & vron 1996 ) a standard quasar spectrum can ionize out to @xmath40  kpc ( where @xmath41 is the electron density in @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the luminosity in units of 10@xmath44 ) .",
    "this radius is on a galaxy scale for typical ism densities , or on a larger scale for the central densities typical of strong cooling flows ( @xmath41=0.1 , fabian 1994 ) .",
    "if the absorbers have the same densities as the ionized absorbers in seyfert galaxies ( @xmath45@xmath42 , mathur , elvis & wilkes 1996 ) then they will lie at radii of @xmath71  pc , a plausible distance .",
    "the ionization state thus allows both nuclear and large - scale locations for the absorbers .",
    "at least some of the higher redshift quasars show blue continua ( table 1 ) .",
    "pks2126@xmath24158 has an accurately power - law - like spectrum ( @xmath46=@xmath240.51@xmath47 , kuhn 1996 ) .",
    "the lack of curvature in this spectrum requires any reddening ( with an smc reddening law ) to have a@xmath481.0 ( 3@xmath49 , kuhn 1996 ) , a factor 10 lower than is implied by the x - ray cut - off ( for a milky way dust - to - gas ratio ) .",
    "a similar ratio is often encountered in seyfert galaxies ( reichert et al . , 1985 , schachter et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "we can invert the argument used above for the red 3c quasars : if the gas was initially dusty , then heating by the quasar continuum radiation has probably raised the dust to temperatures above 1750  k causing dust loss through sublimation .",
    "this implies a maximum distance for the gas from the continuum source of @xmath710  pc , and hence @xmath5010  @xmath6 .",
    "this supports somewhat a nuclear origin for the absorbers .",
    "any changes in continuum luminosity will be tracked by nuclear , high density , absorbers , which offers a diagnostic for their location .",
    "since the absorbers are common ( @xmath740% at high z , paper i ) they must have a large covering factor , unless a special geometry applies .",
    "this is similar to the case of seyfert galaxies where x - ray ionized absorbers are seen in at least half the objects ( reynolds 1997 ) , although only 10%-25% show uv absorption lines ( ulrich 1988 , g.kriss , private communication ) probably because the absorber is too highly ionized .",
    "using the arguments of mathur , elvis & wilkes ( 1996 ) this large covering factor would imply mass loss rates that could be as large as @xmath7100m@xmath51/year .",
    "the associated absorption lines seen in this sample are mostly of metal species : ovi , civ , nv .",
    "this implies an enriched absorbing medium .",
    "the abundances in the absorbers will give a clue to their origin .",
    "quasar nuclei at @xmath52 often seem to show large ( factor 10 ) overabundances relative to solar ( hamman & ferland 1993 ) .",
    "galaxies at these redshifts are more likely to have undergone little star formation and so have the low abundances found in damped lyman-@xmath9 systems ( wolfe et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "it will soon be possible to obtain better x - ray and optical spectra that will allow abundance determinations .",
    "the radio properties of the sample are unclear .",
    "only two of the objects have clear gigahertz peaked spectra .",
    "however another three may show ghz cut - offs with mhz excesses ( table 2 , figure 1 ) .",
    "other sources have spectra that are not well defined .",
    "radio spectra compiled from the literature can be misleading because of variability .",
    "odea ( 1990 ) found that about half of the radio loud quasars at high redshift ( z@xmath33 ) were gps candidates based on a similar literature search of spectra .",
    "we conclude that the tentative connection of x - ray cut - offs with gps sources ( elvis et al",
    ". , 1994 ) remains ambiguous with this larger sample .",
    "simultaneous 0.3 - 30  ghz spectra of all these quasars would clarify the situation .",
    "if the quasars are dominated by emission from a relativistic jet , i.e. are blazars , then the picture is quite different : a special geometry clearly applies , and photoionization by the normal quasar continuum could well be irrelevant . the presence of mm variability in pks  0438@xmath24436 and pks  1334@xmath24127 ; of radio core - jet structures in s4  0917 + 449 , pks  2351@xmath24154 , and pks  2126@xmath24158 ; and the large velocities of the absorbers in pks  0537@xmath24286 and pks  2126@xmath24158 suggests that the presence of blazar properties may be related to the absorbers .",
    "( note though that neither of the mm - variable quasars has known optical absorption lines . )",
    "ionized absorbers are known in blazar x - ray spectra ( canizares & kruper 1984 , marscher 1988 , madejski et al . , 1991 ) ,",
    "adn also in the galactic superluminal sourceds gro  j1655@xmath2440 and grs  1915 + 105 ( ueda et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "if the absorbers are seen only in end - on jets then the special orientation required would eliminate the covering factor and mass loss arguments above .",
    "good radio spectral and polarization measurements can decide which of these quasars are blazars .",
    "vla measurements are scheduled .",
    "if the absorbers are jet related , we might identify the @xmath53 of the ionized absorber as the hot spot advance speed .",
    "similar hotspot advance speeds are derived in compact steep spectrum ( css ) quasars ( readhead et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "( the larger velocities , @xmath54 , required to explain the relativistic beaming effects in jets may well be much larger than the advance speed of the hotspot , pearson 1996 . )",
    "the absorber may be the boundary layer between the jet and the surrounding medium . in this case",
    "the absorber may be shock ionized , rather than photoionized by the quasar continuum .",
    "entrainment of ambient material in the jet at the boundary layer ( e.g. de young 1996 ) may then be probed by x - ray and optical absorption , allowing study of the entrainment process and of the composition of the ambient medium .",
    "although the arguments here favor a nuclear , probably jet - related , origin for the x - ray absorption found in paper i , it is hard in this picture to explain the evolution of this absorption with redshift .",
    "instead , there is strong evidence that high z quasars and radio galaxies do lie in a galaxy - scale high density medium which probably has large column densities .",
    "strong , highly polarized , lyman-@xmath9 emitting gas with knotty complex morphology is seen aligned with the radio structures - the ` alignment effect ' ( di  serego alighieri et al . , 1988 ) .",
    "radio galaxies sometimes show large lyman-@xmath9 hi haloes and disks with a column density of @xmath710@xmath55  @xmath6 ( rttgering et al . , 1996 ) . in unified schemes for agn ( barthel 1989 , urry & padovani 1995 )",
    "the central engine would illuminate this medium in other directions , causing it to be highly ionized .",
    "when we observe a quasar we will be looking through this medium which will show an x - ray / uv absorber .",
    "( the column density seen will depend on the degree of flattening of the medium . ) in fact css quasars show an excess of associated uv absorbers ( baker & hunstead 1996 ) .",
    "in pks  2351@xmath24154 ( and possibly pks0537@xmath24286 ) , in which the absorber @xmath33 is small , the observed x - ray absorption may be from this large scale medium .",
    "future x - ray observations targetted to this end should show absorption and so reveal a great deal about this galaxy scale high z medium .",
    "better x - ray data are essential .",
    "in particular , high resolution x - ray spectra will be able to measure the redshift of the oxygen edge in high redshift quasars .",
    "this will test the association with the optical absorption lines and will directly measure the ionization state and constrain the abundances in the absorber .",
    "for ovii this edge will appear at @xmath56  kev , i.e. around 0.2  kev .",
    "as an example , the axaf ` low energy transmission gratings ' ( letgs ) have a resolution @xmath571500 at this energy and so can determine an edge velocity to @xmath58  km  s@xmath11 .",

    "areas of several square meters ( c.f .",
    "elvis & fabbiano 1997 ) are needed to exploit the available spectral information for a reasonable range of quasar luminosities at high z.",
    "paper i showed that high redshift radio - loud quasars often show low energy x - ray cut - offs associated with the quasars , with an increasing fraction of cut - offs being found at high redshifts . in this paper",
    "we have shown that x - ray cut - offs and optical absorption associated with the quasar are statistically linked , and hence that the x - ray cut - offs are indeed due to photoelectric absorption .",
    "a prediction is that lower redshift radio - loud quasars will have fewer associated uv absorbers .",
    "in contrast to the low z absorbed quasars in the sample , which are often dusty , the high z absorbers have low dust content and are highly ionized . the location of the absorber is probably nuclear , based on the large velocities in some , and on the absence of dust .",
    "the evolution with redshift would be more naturally explained , however , if the absorbers were on the scale of the host galaxy or larger .",
    "the absorbers may be associated with the jets in these sources , given the large number of core - jet and highly variable radio sources . in this case",
    "the absorbers may be entrained material , located at the boundary layer between the jet and the surrounding medium .",
    "far more work will be needed to establish this association , however .",
    "the association with gps radio sources is still ambiguous and requires better radio data to be confirmed or rejected .",
    "x - ray spectroscopy is the most powerful means of following up this work : velocity measurements could clinch the optical absorber / x - ray absorber association ; identifying the relative ionization states of oxygen via the o - k edges will reveal the ionization state of the absorber ; combining optical and x - ray spectroscopy will allow abundance measurements , perhaps determining the origin of the absorbing material .",
    "other tools include optical / x - ray variability which could definitively associate the absorber with the nucleus .",
    "also , searches for a large scale absorbing medium around high z quasars could improve the case for a large scale origin in some cases .",
    "radio spectra , polarization ( which are in progress ) and vlbi mapping could definitively determine the nature of the quasars in the sample , be it gps , blazar , or another type .",
    "larger samples of cut - off x - ray quasars can be created using the hitherto unidentified sources in the rosat database . in intermediate ,",

    "<S> two other cut - off quasars show reddening associated with the quasar . we conclude that absorption is highly likely to be the cause of the x - ray cut - offs , and that the absorbing material associated with the quasars , not intervening along the line - of - sight . </S>",
