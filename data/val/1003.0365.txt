    "the jahn - teller effect of impurity ions in semiconductors with degenerate ground state is well known since long time .",
    "most of its theoretical treatments were based on crystal field theory .",
    "actually , the class of diluted magnetic semiconductors regains a lot of interest in connection with the search for new materials for spintronics applications .",
    "for example , high curie temperatures were predicted in gan : mn .",
    "@xcite corresponding experimental @xcite or ab - initio studies @xcite seemed to confirm these predictions",
    ". however , the experimental results are very disputed since they might be caused by small inclusions of secondary phases . @xcite and also most of the previous ab - initio studies obtained a partially filled band of only one spin direction at the fermi level ( half - metallic behavior ) which will be shown to be an artifact of those calculations .",
    "actually , the mn ion changes its valence in the chemical series from gaas : mn , via gap : mn to gan : mn .",
    "@xcite it is mn@xmath3 in gaas : mn ( for a sufficiently high mn - concentration)@xcite which leads to hole doping , but it remains mn@xmath4 in gan : mn .",
    "and the jahn - teller effect is crucial to stabilize mn@xmath4 .",
    "as will be shown below , only the combined treatment of jahn - teller effect and strong electron correlations leads to the correct electronic structure .",
    "the electron correlations turn out to be the leading interaction , but the jahn - teller effect is necessary to break the symmetry .",
    "we present here a combined ab - initio and crystal field theory of magnetic ions in ii - vi or iii - v semiconductors . as representative examples we treat the 3@xmath0 ions mn@xmath4 in gan and cr@xmath3 in zns . the first one is chosen because of its actual interest for spintronic applications and the second one since it is a very well studied model system for the jahn - teller effect of @xmath0 ions .",
    "@xcite our ab - initio results are in good agreement with the experimental data , but only if we include properly the effects of the electron correlations in the 3@xmath5 shell . for that purpose",
    "we use the lsda+@xmath2 method .",
    "the resulting electronic structure corrects previous electronic structure calculations ( which did not take into account the combined effect of jahn - teller distortion and coulomb correlation , neither for mn - doped gan @xcite nor for cr - doped zns @xcite ) in a dramatic way : instead of half - metallic behavior we obtain an insulating ground state with a considerable excitation gap .",
    "similar results for gan : mn were reported earlier but using different methods than in our study .",
    "@xcite in a second step , to make contact with the traditional literature on that subject , we connect our ab - initio results with crystal field theory .",
    "we obtain the complete set of crystal field parameters in good agreement with previous optical measurements.@xcite    we treat the host crystals in zinc - blende phase .",
    "both magnetic ions are in the 3@xmath0 configuration .",
    "the electronic level is split by a cubic crystal field created by the first nearest neighbors ( ligands ) of the transition metal ion .",
    "but it remains partially filled and the jahn - teller effect may occur which induces the splitting of the partially filled level due to displacements of the ligands around the transition metal ion .",
    "the local symmetry of the crystal is reduced and the total energy of the supercell is minimized .",
    "the energy gain is denoted as @xmath6 .",
    "our calculations are performed using the full potential local orbital ( fplo)@xcite method with the lsda+@xmath2 ( local spin density approximation with strong coulomb interaction)@xcite approximation in the atomic limit scheme .",
    "the lattice constants are optimized for the pure semiconductors using the lsda method , @xmath7   for gan and @xmath8    for zns . to study the jahn - teller effect",
    ", we use a supercell of 64 atoms in zinc blende phase , and a @xmath9 k - point mesh .",
    "the lsda+@xmath2 parameters are introduced as slater parameters : for mn ( see ref .  ) , @xmath10 ev , @xmath11 ev and for cr ( see ref .  ) , @xmath12 ev , @xmath13 ev . the @xmath14 parameter is equal to @xmath2 , and is chosen to be 4 ev . this value is in good agreement with other works and it corresponds to the value which gives the maximum splitting of the triplet state in @xmath15 symmetry .",
    "we have verified that our results are not very sensitive to the actual choice of the @xmath2 parameter .",
    "the value @xmath16 ev gives representative results for a rather large range of @xmath2 parameters reaching from 3 up to 8 ev .",
    "( red spheres ) to @xmath15 ( green spheres ) . ]",
    "the transition metal ions ( mn or cr ) substitute one atom in the center of the crystal and there is a complete tetrahedron of ligands around the magnetic ion . without distortion ,",
    "the tetrahedron is in the @xmath17 symmetry group ( cubic ) . by symmetry , there are two tetragonal ( point groups @xmath18 and @xmath15 ) and one trigonal ( @xmath19 ) possible jahn - teller distortions .",
    "we have verified that the most important energy gain is obtained with the pure tetragonal distortion where the symmetry reduces from @xmath17 to @xmath15 .",
    "that is in agreement with a previous study of the jahn - teller effect in gan : mn where , however , the electron correlation had not been taken into account .",
    "@xcite the schematic displacement of ligands is represented in fig . [ f1 ] , it is defined by @xmath20 .",
    "to study the jahn - teller distortion we use a supercell of 64 atoms .",
    "we performed a series of calculations with different displacements of the ligands around the impurity in order to find the configuration which minimizes the total energy of the supercell .",
    "the preferred configuration is of @xmath15 symmetry and the results for the density of states ( dos ) are presented in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] . for mn - doped gan ,",
    "the distance between mn and n is @xmath21   ( with cubic symmetry , it is @xmath22  ) with @xmath23 pm and @xmath24 pm .",
    "the jahn - teller effect induces a lowering of the total energy by 38.13 mev and a splitting of the triplet state by 0.81 ev . for cr - doped zns ,",
    "the results are similar , the distance cr - s is @xmath25   ( @xmath26   without jahn - teller effect ) , with @xmath27 pm and @xmath28 pm . the total energy decreases by @xmath29 mev and the splitting of the triplet level is @xmath30 ev .    without @xmath2 , in the lsda method",
    ", we also find a jahn - teller effect for gan : mn but the energy gain is smaller by nearly two orders of magnitude , only 0.71 mev . in the lsda method",
    "all the 3@xmath5 levels are located in the gap with a rather small mixing to the @xmath31 orbitals . without jahn - teller effect",
    ", there is a small band of @xmath32 character which is partially filled and one finds half - metallic behavior .",
    "the hubbard correlation opens up a considerable gap .",
    "the empty state ( singlet ) is mainly of 3@xmath5 character for the two compounds and the doublet , just below the fermi level is mainly of 2@xmath33 character originating from ligand orbitals .",
    "that change of orbital character arises since the lsda+@xmath2 method pushes the occupied 3@xmath5 levels much lower in energy than in the lsda method . as a consequence",
    ", the transition to the first excited state has a considerable @xmath33-@xmath5 character and should be visible as an optical interband transition .",
    "that allows a reinterpretation of the optical transition at 1.4 ev ( for gan : mn ) which is usually considered as a pure @xmath5-@xmath5 transition .",
    "@xcite in agreement with a proposal of dietl it corresponds to a transition from the @xmath0 configuration to @xmath34 and ligand hole .",
    "@xcite    there are two peaks in the unoccupied , minority dos at about 2.5 ev for gan : mn .",
    "they correspond to crystal field split 3@xmath5 levels which were well seen in x - ray absorption spectroscopy . up to now , they were interpreted by means of a lsda calculation , @xcite but our dos shows that these peaks occur also in the more realistic lsda+@xmath2 approach where , however , a detailed calculation of the matrix element effects ( which was performed in ref .  ) is still lacking .    for gan : mn , the total magnetic moment is equal to @xmath35 , corresponding to @xmath36 .",
    "that fits well with the ionicity @xmath37 for manganese .",
    "the local magnetic moment at the manganese site is slightly enhanced @xmath38 which is compensated by small induced magnetic moments of opposite sign at the neighboring ligands and further neighbors .    another interesting result is presented in fig . [ f3 ] . in this case",
    "we introduced the local coulomb correlation but no lattice deformation .",
    "the local cubic symmetry was however broken by the occupation of the triplet state .",
    "the calculation still shows an insulating case with nearly the same splitting of the triplet state .",
    "this observation is not visible within the lsda method .",
    "therefore , we can say that the splitting of the triplet state is mainly due to the strong correlation of 3@xmath5 electrons .",
    "the jahn - teller distortion introduces a small additional splitting of the triplet state : @xmath39 mev for mn - doped gan and @xmath40 mev for cr - doped zns .",
    "this interpretation is confirmed by a pure lsda calculation , because it gives an identical value of the splitting with the same ligand coordinates .",
    "a negative value of the splitting corresponds to a stretching of the tetrahedron along the z axis ( fig . [",
    "f3](b ) ) .",
    "for a deeper understanding of the jahn - teller effect we treat it also in ligand field theory . in that theory ,",
    "the degeneracy of the impurity 3@xmath5 level is split due to hybridization with the neighboring ligands . in the following we neglect the electrostatic contributions which will be shown to be justified for gan : mn and to a lesser extent for zns :",
    "when the 3@xmath5 ion is in the center of an ideal tetrahedron , the cubic crystal field splits this level into a triplet state and a doublet state .",
    "the distance separating these two levels is denoted as @xmath41 .",
    "then , the jahn - teller effect splits the doublet state into two singlet states , and the triplet state into a doublet state and a singlet state .",
    "the distance between these levels is denoted as @xmath42 ( shown in fig .",
    "the local hamiltonian in ligand field or crystal field theory can be expressed as @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are steven s parameters and steven s operators , respectively .",
    "@xcite the first part represents the hamiltonian of an ideal tetrahedron and the second describes the linear jahn - teller effect .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath46 correspond to the 3@xmath5 electronic levels of the magnetic ion ( they represent the spectrum ) .",

    "the crystal field hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) has the same form for the one - particle problem ( with parameters @xmath47 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 ) or for the 3@xmath0 multiplet ( with parameters @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 ) .",
    "@xcite the fundamental multiplet state is @xmath49 ( @xmath55 and @xmath36 ) . in this fundamental state ,",
    "the orbital moment for one electron ( @xmath56 ) is equal to the total orbital moment .",

    "the value of @xmath72 is adjusted such that @xmath73 equals the experimental value .",
    "the results are very convincing which proves that the exceptional large value of @xmath74 ev in the case of gan : mn is dominantly caused by the hybridization energy to the ligands . on the other hand ,",
    "the neglect of the electrostatic contribution is certainly an approximation which shows its limits for zns : cr .",
    "the procedure described above gives no satisfactory results .",
    "we interpret this deficiency such that the electrostatic corrections become more important for zns : cr which has a much smaller value of @xmath73 indicating a smaller hybridization . as discussed in ref .",
    ", the higher order crystal field parameters , and especially @xmath75 are certainly more influenced by further reaching neighbors than @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , we determine the @xmath77 parameter from the experimentally known value of @xmath73 and introduce a second free parameter ( @xmath78 ) which is fitted to the lsda+@xmath2 energy gain .",
    "the parameter set for zns : cr which was found in such a manner ( table [ t1 ] ) is now in good agreement with previous optical measurements .",

    "@xmath87 @xcite to analyze their data obtained by optical measurements and electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) @xmath88 here , the @xmath89 parameter is the jahn - teller coupling coefficient , and @xmath90 is a diagonal 3 * 3 matrix which describes the splitting of the @xmath86 triplet into the upper @xmath91 doublet and the lower @xmath92 singlet .",
    "its diagonal elements are 1/2 ( corresponding to @xmath91 ) and -1 ( corresponding to@xmath92 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath93 describes the lattice stiffness and is connected with the phonon frequency by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the mass of one ligand . minimizing the energy ( [ eq8 ] ) we find the relationship @xmath96 and the jahn - teller energy @xmath97 therefore , if we know the jahn - teller energy @xmath6 and the lattice distortion @xmath80 , we may calculate the coupling coefficient @xmath89 and the phonon frequency @xmath98 and compare it with other works .",
    "the comparison is not an ideal one since our lsda+@xmath2 results do not correspond to a pure tetragonal distortion .",
    "they contain an important part of the breathing mode which comes about due to recharging effects around the impurity being not treated in the ligand field theory or in the analysis of the optical data in refs .   and .",
    "nevertheless , we compare in table [ t2 ] our ab - initio and ligand field results with other theoretical or experimental work from the literature .",
    "we may remark a rather good agreement for the jahn - teller energy @xmath6 between our work and the optical data of vallin _",
    "et al _ for zns : cr .",
    "@xcite however , our estimate of the phonon frequency is much larger .",
    "a detailed analysis of this discrepancy is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we just remark that higher phonon frequencies would mean a more profound tendency towards the dynamic jahn - teller effect . and there are indeed discussions ( not for zns : cr , however ) whether the experimental data of gan : mn should be interpreted as a static @xcite or a dynamic @xcite jahn - teller effect .",
    "such nonadiabatic effects can , however , not at all be treated in density functional based methods .",
    "many ab - initio studies of mn - doped gan or cr - doped zns , mostly based on the lsda approximation , result in a half - metallic behavior . in those calculations ,",
    "the fermi level is located in a small 3@xmath5 band of majority spin within the middle of the gap of the host semi - conductor .",
    "@xcite we have shown , that such a result is an artifact of the lsda method and can be repaired by taking into account the strong coulomb correlation in the @xmath1 shell and the jahn - teller effect simultaneously . allowing for a jahn - teller distortion only , but neglecting the coulomb correlation leads to a tiny gap at the fermi level.@xcite and also the opposite procedure of taking into account the coulomb correlation by the lsda+@xmath2 method (",
    "i.e.  the same method which we have used ) but remaining in cubic symmetry is insufficient.@xcite the origin for this deficiency in the given case of a @xmath0 impurity is a threefold degenerate level of @xmath32 symmetry at the fermi level which is occupied with one electron only .",
    "it is sufficient to break the local cubic symmetry in the presence of a strong electron correlation to obtain insulating behavior with a gap of the order of 1 ev .",
    "such an electronic structure is in agreement with the known experimental data for both compounds . using the lsda+@xmath2 method we found the jahn - teller energy gain @xmath6 in good agreement with known optical data.@xcite    in addition to the ab - initio calculations",
    ", we developed a ligand field theory to reach a deeper understanding of the jahn - teller effect .",
    "it uses the @xmath33-@xmath5 hybridization between 3@xmath5 impurity and ligands as principal origin of the crystal field splitting.@xcite this hybridization is parametrized by the harrison scheme@xcite and the lattice energy as obtained from our ab - initio calculation is added .",
    "the resulting energy gain is very close to the ab - initio results but the ligand field theory allows in addition the determination of the complete set of crystal field parameters .",
    "we find good agreement with the experimental parameter set for gan : mn.@xcite the comparison is a little bit speculative since the experimental data were obtained for mn in wurtzite gan .",
    "it turns out , that the mn impurity leads to an additional tetragonal jahn - teller distortion in addition to the intrinsic trigonal deformation of the host lattice .",
    "and we find the parameters of this tetragonal distortion close to our results for zinc - blende gan ( which can be synthesized , but for which no measurements exist up to now ) .",
    "we have observed that our ligand field method works better for gan : mn than for zns : cr due to the very large cubic crystal field splitting @xmath74 ev in the former case ( in contrast to @xmath99 ev for zns : cr ) .",
    "our combined ab - initio and analytical study allows also a comparison with the `` classical '' work on zns : cr .",
    "the jahn - teller efect of that model compound was already studied in the seventies in great detail by optical and epr measurements .",
    "@xcite we obtain an energy gain @xmath6 very close to the experimental data but higher phonon frequencies .",
    "finally , we would like to discuss the importance of our results for spintronics applications .",
    "first of all , the jahn - teller mechanism which we describe is not restricted to the two compounds of our study .",
    "it may occur in all cases where the impurity level is well separated from the valence band but only partially filled .",
    "the jahn - teller effect leads to insulating behavior which questions many previous ab - initio studies in the literature . in the case of gan : mn all available information points to the stability of mn@xmath4 which hinders an intrinsic hole doping by mn .",
    "( experimentally , one may find mn@xmath3 in electron doped samples , which is not well suited for spintronics applications either . )",
    "one still has the possibility to reach hole doping by a second impurity besides mn ( co - doping ) . that would allow the classical mechanism for ferromagnetism in diluted magnetic semiconductors with @xmath36 local moments at the mn sites .",
