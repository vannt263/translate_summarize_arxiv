    "in this paper , we consider the cauchy problem for the cubic - quintic nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) on @xmath2 : @xmath3 which arises as the natural hamiltonian evolution associated to the energy @xmath4 here @xmath5 is a complex - valued function of @xmath6 .",
    "this model appears in numerous problems in physics , including field theory , nonlinear optics , the mean - field theory of superconductivity , langmuir waves in plasma physics , and the motion of bose  einstein condensates ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "this ubiquity is strongly connected to the particular signs appearing in and . as we hope to convince the reader",
    ", the combination of focusing cubic nonlinearity and defocusing quintic nonlinearity is physically very natural and leads to interesting mathematics .    for systems at low densities ,",
    "nonlinear effects should be weak and hence it is natural to perform a taylor expansion on the associated part of the energy and keep only the lowest nonlinear term .",
    "this produces the cubic term in , at least in a gauge invariant setting . such a term with a positive coefficient ( i.e. , the defocusing case ) represents an inherent repulsion of the constituents of the system and leads to global solutions that disperse .",
    "a mathematically rigorous proof of this assertion has been available for some time ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "a cubic term with a negative coefficient ( the focusing case ) is physically a very natural scenario .",
    "atoms / molecules do experience an attractive ( van der waals ) force at moderate densities ; indeed , such attraction underlies the condensation of gases into liquids at low temperatures . similarly , the focusing cubic nls is also commonly used to model the self - focusing of laser beams in certain nonlinear materials .",
    "as might be expected , the three - dimensional focusing cubic nls has also received considerable mathematical attention .",
    "it was proved in the 1970 s that blowup occurs for an open set of large initial data ; see @xcite . for a more up - to - date view of this phenomenon , see @xcite and the references therein .    in the physical systems",
    "alluded to above , no true singularity occurs .",
    "the very concentration that mathematics predicts degrades the accuracy of the model ; new physics comes into play , preventing further collapse . from a mathematical point of view , the simplest way to incorporate such phenomenology is to introduce a defocusing nonlinearity of the next higher power .",
    "a deeper understanding of the underlying physics is , of course , needed to predict the appropriate coupling constant .    by making an appropriate choice of units for space , time , and the solution values , it is possible to scale away any coupling constants in front of the nonlinearities ; only the signs remain .",
    "unlike the case of a single power nonlinearity , this exhausts all scaling symmetries .",
    "indeed , the dynamics of solutions living at disparate length scales are inherently different ; the amplitude and spatial scale of a solution affects the relative strengths of the linear dispersion and each of the two nonlinearities .",
    "we will exploit two conservation laws associated to the flow in addition to the energy , namely , the mass and momentum ; these are given by @xmath7 respectively . through the rescaling",
    "used to normalize the equation , information about the relative strength of the two nonlinearities is transfered to the mass and energy .",
    "this behooves us to consider initial data for as broad a mass / energy region as we are able . in section  [ sec : me ] , we determine precisely which mass / energy pairs are actually possible ; figure  [ f : me ] summarizes our results .",
    "ultimately , we would like to produce a ` phase diagram ' for , indicating which dynamical behaviours are possible in which regions of the mass / energy plane .",
    "this is the long - term dream that guides the investigations in this paper .",
    "there is no reason to introduce momentum as a third axis in this phase diagram .",
    "the galilei symmetry can be exploited to normalize the momentum to zero , while leaving the mass unchanged and modifying the energy in the obvious manner ( see the proof of proposition  [ prop : p(u)=0 ] ) .",
    "indeed , this transformation simply amounts to passing to the rest frame of the centre of mass .",
    "the physical intuition espoused earlier suggests that should have global solutions .",
    "this has been proved rigorously :    [ t : matador ] the initial value problem admits a unique global solution @xmath8 in the class @xmath9 and the solution depends continuously ( in @xmath9 ) on the initial data @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , the solution obeys conservation of mass , energy , and momentum .",
    "the cited paper presents a proof of uniqueness only within the subclass of solutions that also belong to @xmath11 .",
    "however , the ideas needed to upgrade this to the ` unconditional uniqueness ' formulated above appear already in @xcite ; see also @xcite for an adaptation of the argument to an equation very similar to",
    ".    the global well - posedness of can not be proved by the same simple direct arguments that apply to the defocusing cubic nls .",
    "this stems from the fact that the quintic nonlinearity is energy - critical in three spatial dimensions . to better explain this point and its effects on the analysis ,",
    "let us first redirect our discussion to the defocusing quintic nls @xmath12 in @xmath2 , whose energy functional is given by @xmath13    the rescaling @xmath14 is a symmetry of solutions to .",
    "this scaling also preserves the energy functional , which is why is termed energy - critical .    for defocusing nonlinearities with power smaller than five , energy conservation prevents concentration .",
    "this combined with simple contraction mapping arguments yields a proof of global well - posedness . for the energy - critical problem , this is not the case ; indeed , the scaling symmetry shows that concentration is perfectly consistent with energy conservation .",
    "note that we can not use other nls conservation laws to prevent concentration ; energy has the highest regularity among all known conservation laws .",
    "the development of methods to tackle this problem of criticality constitutes one of the major breakthroughs in the study of nonlinear dispersive equations . in the case of nls , it was precisely for the equation that this breakthrough was first made :    [ t : quintic ] equation admits a unique global @xmath15 solution for every initial data @xmath16 .",
    "this solution obeys @xmath17    the spacetime bound provides an explicit expression that solutions disperse , something that we previously intuited must hold in the defocusing case .",
    "in fact , this bound leads to the following conclusion : there exist asymptotic states @xmath18 so that @xmath19 this says that the solution scatters ( to the linear flow ) as @xmath20 .",
    "more formally , this is the statement of asymptotic completeness of wave operators .",
    "the question of existence of wave operators is easily settled by contraction mapping arguments , even in this scaling - critical case .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ t : quintic ] is long and subtle .",
    "this remains true , even after incorporating the extensive developments spawned by this breakthrough over the intervening decade ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    as will be evident from the arguments in section  [ sec:6 ] ,",
    "any solution to can be embedded as a solution to in a certain scaling regime .",
    "correspondingly , any reasonably quantitative proof of theorem  [ t : matador ] must automatically imply theorem  [ t : quintic ] . the key theme underlying the proof of theorem  [ t : matador ] in @xcite is to argue conversely , namely , to start with theorem  [ t : quintic ] and treat the cubic term as a perturbation .",
    "( this idea is further expanded upon in @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it is shown that if one considers the cubic - quintic nls with _ both _ nonlinearities defocusing , then scattering holds ( in @xmath21 ) even for large initial data @xmath22 .",
    "the papers @xcite also prove a scattering result for our equation . specifically , they show that if the mass of the initial data is sufficiently small , depending on the @xmath23 norm of the initial data , then scattering holds .",
    "to be more precise , sufficiently small mass means smaller than the reciprocal of a tower of exponentials in the @xmath23 norm .",
    "this is the best one can achieve via these perturbative methods , because of the best known quantitative bounds in .",
    "one of the main results of this paper is a proof of scattering for initial data whose mass and energy belong to the larger region @xmath24 in the mass / energy plane :    [ thm : main ] let @xmath10 be such that @xmath25 belongs to the region @xmath24 defined in section  [ sec : virial ] .",
    "then , the unique global solution @xmath26 to the cubic - quintic nls satisfies @xmath27 in particular , the solution @xmath8 scatters in @xmath28 both forward and backward in time .",
    "the region @xmath24 is depicted in figure  [ f : r preview ] .",
    "we will give a precise description of @xmath24 later in the introduction , once we have covered the necessary prerequisites . for now , we note the following consequence of theorem  [ thm : main ] : there is a mass threshold @xmath29 so that scattering holds for all initial data with @xmath30 , irrespective of the energy ( or @xmath23-norm ) .    theorem  [ thm : main ] is not a perturbative result .",
    "we will be able to show that scattering fails for certain solutions whose mass and energy lie on the boundary of @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , the exact value of the mass threshold @xmath29 noted above is dictated by the optimizers of a certain gagliardo",
    " nirenberg - type inequality ( see section  [ sec : gnh ] ) .",
    "we show that these optimizers are radially symmetric solutions to a certain elliptic pde .",
    "this reduces matters to an ode problem that is readily susceptible to numerical investigation via the shooting method . in this way",
    ", we are lead to the assertion that scattering holds for @xmath31 .",
    "scattering does not hold for all initial data @xmath10 ; our equation admits solitons . in this paper , we will use the word ` soliton ' to refer to solutions to of the form @xmath32 .",
    "naturally , the galilei symmetry can be exploited to introduce ( or remove ) translational motion .    as well as limiting the region where scattering can occur",
    ", solitons also constitute an essential ingredient in any purported phase diagram of the dynamical behaviour of . section  [ sec : solitons ] is devoted to the study of solitons for our equation .",
    "pohozaev identities show that solitons can only exist when @xmath33 ; see lemma  [ l : poho ] .",
    "that solitons do indeed exist for all such frequencies @xmath34 is then deduced from the general results of @xcite .",
    "note that the soliton profile is necessarily different for differing @xmath34 ; recall that in the case of a single focusing nonlinearity there is a scaling symmetry , which means that solitons have the same profile for all @xmath35 .",
    "the paper @xcite actually shows that admits infinitely many radially symmetric solitons for each @xmath33 .",
    "we focus our attention on what are known as ground state solitons , that is , solitons for which @xmath36 is non - negative .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec : solitons ] , these exist for all @xmath33 ; indeed , there is a unique ground state soliton @xmath37 for each such @xmath34 .",
    "we curtail our investigation in this particular way because the ground state solitons are the smallest solitons in a certain mass / energy sense ; see theorem  [ t : solitons](i ) .",
    "in particular , it is reasonable to predict that it is these solitons which mark the boundary of the region in the mass / energy plane where only scattering occurs .",
    "note that pure scattering behaviour will not hold in any region where both mass and energy exceed the mass and energy of a soliton .",
    "this is easily seen by constructing solutions containing a soliton and a radiation term .",
    "as part of our analysis of the ground state solitons @xmath37 , we are able to determine the kernel of the linearized operator about @xmath38 : @xmath39 specifically , we prove that it is spanned by the components of @xmath40 .",
    "this spectral condition is an invaluable stepping stone for any subsequent rigourous analysis of the stability or asymptotic stability of soliton solutions , at least by the usual methods .",
    "in particular , our verification of the spectral condition allows one to apply the arguments in @xcite to see that solitons are stable wherever the mass / energy curve is concave and unstable where it is convex .",
    "figures  [ f : pw ] , [ f : numerics1 ] and  [ f : numerics2 ] depict the mass / energy curve for the solitons @xmath37 , based on numerics .",
    "we note that there is an upper branch of solitons where the curve is convex ( signaling instability ) and a lower branch where it is concave ( indicating stability ) .",
    "note that from our result on the linearized operator , we know that @xmath41 is a real - analytic @xmath21-valued function ; the explanation for the cusp is that @xmath42 and @xmath43 both vanish at the same point .",
    "indeed , by , both vanish to the same order .",
    "our numerics show a single cusp , corresponding to the vanishing of @xmath42 at a single point @xmath44 , which in turn is the global minimum of @xmath45 and the global maximum of @xmath46 .",
    "unfortunately , we have not been able to prove this ; it constitutes our conjecture  [ conj : mass ] .",
    "the solitons @xmath47 have been the subject of several numerical studies in the physics literature @xcite , in their role as  light bullets \" or ",
    "3d spatiotemporal optical solitons \" .",
    "these numerics confirm our independent investigations and should be consulted by readers interested in plots of mass or energy against the frequency parameter @xmath34 .    the behavior of unstable ( upper branch ) soliton solutions to has been investigated numerically in lower dimensions @xcite .",
    "these authors observe that solutions beginning near the unstable branch of solitons approach a soliton on the lower branch , shedding their excess mass / energy in the form of radiation .    for nls with a single focusing nonlinearity",
    ", ground state solitons can be characterized as optimizers of certain gagliardo  nirenberg inequalities .",
    "this has played an important role in many investigations , beginning with the seminal work @xcite . section  [ sec : gnh ] is devoted to the discussion of an analogue for our problem . because there is a one - parameter family of ground state soliton profiles ( unlike the scale - invariant case of a single power nonlinearity )",
    ", we will need a one - parameter family of inequalities .",
    "our candidates are the following : @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "the veracity of is easily deduced by interpolating between the classical gagliardo ",
    "nirenberg inequality ( which corresponds to @xmath50 ) and the hlder inequality ( which corresponds to @xmath51 ) .",
    "in proposition  [ prop : gn ] , we show that optimizers of are ground state solitons , up to scaling and translation .",
    "moreover , optimizing solitons @xmath38 have the property that @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is defined via @xmath54 in particular , no soliton occurs as the optimizer in for more than one value of  @xmath55 .",
    "however , we must acknowledge one short - comming of our results in this direction .",
    "numerics show that @xmath56 is strictly increasing , which would imply that each soliton occurs as the unique optimizer for the corresponding value of @xmath55 .",
    "we have been unable to prove this ; see conjecture  [ conj : beta ] .    as mentioned earlier ,",
    "section  [ sec : me ] is devoted to determining all feasible mass / energy pairs ; see figure  [ f : me ] .",
    "a transition occurs at mass @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a ground state soliton optimizing in the case @xmath59 . for masses below @xmath57 ,",
    "the energy is necessarily positive ; the infimal mass is zero , but this is not achieved . at the mass @xmath57 ,",
    "zero energy is still the infimal energy , but is now achieved ; moreover , it is achieved only by certain solitons . for masses strictly greater than @xmath57 , the infimal",
    "energy is now negative and is achieved precisely by some soliton .",
    "our region @xmath24 is wholly contained in the mass strip where @xmath60 . indeed , in the region @xmath61 it is impossible , using only mass and energy variables , to segregate solutions that scatter from those that converge to a soliton plus radiation .",
    "beginning with section  [ sec : virial ] we focus more tightly toward the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] . naturally , to obtain a non - perturbative proof of scattering",
    ", one needs some intrinsically nonlinear information about the equation .",
    "this is true even in the defocusing case , where this role is invariably fulfilled by ( traditional or interaction ) morawetz identities . for focusing equations , sharp thresholds",
    "are typically determined via the virial identity ( suitably truncated ) ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "one exception is the work @xcite on the mass - critical nls , which uses a hybrid of the virial and interaction morawetz identities .",
    "dodson - style variants are not advantageous for our problem",
    ". we will use the virial identity .",
    "the virial identity stems from the behaviour of a system under scaling ; however , it is not essential that the system has a scaling symmetry . as is easily verified , the operator @xmath62 is the generator of unitary dilations on @xmath63 .",
    "an elementary computation shows that if @xmath8 is a solution to , then @xmath64 this is the virial identity for our equation ; correspondingly , we will refer to the functional @xmath65 as the virial .    for soliton solutions",
    "@xmath66 , we have @xmath67 and correspondingly , @xmath68 .",
    "on the other hand , for solutions @xmath69 of the linear schrdinger equation , we have @xmath70 in particular , the virial of linear solutions is positive for large times .",
    "the way that the virial identity is employed in the proof of scattering is rather subtle .",
    "one of the key properties of the region @xmath24 is that @xmath71 for any solution @xmath8 to . nevertheless , it is _ not _ true that solutions whose virial is positive for all times must necessarily scatter .",
    "imagine , for example , a solution which consists of a soliton together with radiation . by suitable construction",
    ", one may decouple the contributions of the two parts of the solution to the virial ; indeed , decoupling will be automatic in the @xmath20 limits .",
    "as solitons have zero virial and radiation has positive virial , such a solution would have positive virial for all times , but definitely does not scatter .",
    "our example highlights a central problem that arises when applying conservation laws and similar identities : one only observes the aggregate of all the parts of the solution .",
    "unwanted behaviour of one part of the solution can not be ruled out if it can be compensated for by unreasonable behaviour of another part of the solution . while sometimes space and/or frequency localization techniques can be applied , this is untenable for generic large data due to the resulting combinatorial complexity .    in @xcite",
    ", bourgain introduced the induction on energy technique to overcome an obstruction of precisely this type .",
    "his solution to the combinatorial morass is to inductively exclude unreasonable behaviour at ever increasing energies .",
    "( the energy is a coercive conserved quantity for the problem treated in @xcite . )",
    "the guiding principle , advanced significantly in @xcite , is the following : assume all solutions with energy @xmath72 have been shown to scatter ; this is the inductive hypothesis .",
    "we wish to show that this remains true for all solutions @xmath8 with @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is a very small parameter .",
    "suppose that at some time , such a solution @xmath8 can be written as two well - separated parts , each with energy at least @xmath74 .",
    "then , we may apply the inductive hypothesis to approximate @xmath8 by the sum of two solutions , each of which scatters . that the parts are well - separated is essential .",
    "our equation is nonlinear ; it is only in such a regime that one may obtain an approximate solution by summing two solutions . for the models studied in @xcite and in this paper , two solutions",
    "are well - separated if they live in different spatial locations or at differing length scales .    as consequence of the preceding , we see that the inductive step is reduced to proving scattering for solutions @xmath8 with @xmath73 that consist of a single piece ( up to errors of size @xmath74 ) , with a clearly - defined location in space and spatial / frequency scale .",
    "this substantially enhances the efficacy of conservation laws and monotonicity formulae .",
    "more recent applications of the induction on energy technique employ a contradiction argument , closer in spirit to the well - ordering principle . some of these ideas are already hinted at by the language used in @xcite , for example , the phrase `` minimal energy blowup solution '' .",
    "however , the true mathematical realization of this belongs to keraani @xcite and to kenig ",
    "merle @xcite .",
    "this is the variant we will describe below .",
    "it leads to proofs that are more modular and simpler to understand ; it has also fueled an explosion of applications of the underlying paradigm .",
    "next we will explain the construction of a minimal blowup solution , which captures the essence of the induction on energy argument .",
    "after that , we will return to our discussion of section  [ sec : virial ] and the role of the virial identity .    until now",
    ", the size of solutions has been determined by two variables : mass and energy . for a workable notion of minimality , we need to combine them into a single quantity . to this end",
    ", we introduce a continuous map @xmath75 in subsection  [ ss : exhaustion of r ] .",
    "we will also regard @xmath76 as a function of solutions via @xmath77 . for expositional clarity",
    ", we will arrange that @xmath78 if and only if @xmath79 and define @xmath80 when @xmath81 .",
    "proposition  [ p : all about d ] describes further properties of this function .",
    "given @xmath82 , we define @xmath83 in this way , theorem  [ thm : main ] becomes the statement that @xmath84 for all @xmath82 .",
    "suppose now that theorem  [ thm : main ] were to fail and let @xmath85 be the supremum of all values of @xmath76 for which @xmath86 is finite .",
    "failure of theorem  [ thm : main ] is the assertion that @xmath87 . note that @xmath88 , so @xmath89 .",
    "in fact , proposition  [ thm : small data scattering ] shows that @xmath90 . this proposition is a refinement of the small - data theory developed in @xcite .",
    "the positivity of @xmath85 corresponds to the ` base step ' of the induction .    under our contradiction hypothesis",
    ", there must be a sequence of solutions @xmath91 so that @xmath92 if we could conclude that a subsequence of @xmath91 converges in @xmath21 , perturbation theory ( see proposition  [ perturbation of 3 - 5 ] ) would guarantee that the limit @xmath93 is a minimal blowup solution",
    ". it would be minimal because @xmath94 and a blowup solution because @xmath95 .",
    "the assertion that bounded sequences of solutions converge ( subsequentially ) to a solution is a narrow form of the well - known palais ",
    "smale condition in the calculus of variations .",
    "( our sequence @xmath91 is bounded in @xmath96 because @xmath97 is bounded . )",
    "the usual palais ",
    "smale condition is immediately broken by the presence of non - compact symmetries . for our problem ,",
    "the pertinent symmetries are spatial and temporal translations , as well as a vestigial / broken scaling symmetry .",
    "the first step in handling this issue is to prove an appropriate concentration - compactness principle for the _ linear _ equation .",
    "this is the task of proving a linear profile decomposition ; it is discharged in section  [ sec:5 ] .",
    "our concentration - compactness principle has strong similarities to earlier work on the energy - critical case @xcite ; however , our proofs follow the slightly different path laid out in @xcite . for our problem",
    ", we must work in @xmath21 rather than the homogeneous space @xmath23 and prove decoupling of @xmath98-norms as well as @xmath99-norms .",
    "the techniques needed to adapt the argument have appeared before in the context of other problems with broken symmetries , @xcite . nevertheless , as a service to the reader we provide full details .    the linear profile decomposition",
    ", theorem  [ thm : profile decomposition ] , decomposes a subsequence of initial data @xmath100 into linear combinations of asymptotically orthogonal ( as @xmath101 ) bubbles of concentration .",
    "each bubble @xmath102 appears at an @xmath103-dependent location in space - time @xmath104 at some characteristic length scale @xmath105 .",
    "as noted earlier , for solutions at very small length scales , the quintic nonlinearity is dominant  they behave as solutions to the quintic nls .",
    "the role of section  [ sec:6 ] is to treat bubbles living at such small length scales by exploiting theorem  [ t : quintic ] .    in section  [ sec:7 ]",
    "we combine the results of sections  [ sec:5 ] and  [ sec:6 ] to prove that a version of the palais ",
    "smale condition holds for our problem ( see proposition  [ prop : palais - smale ] ) and then that failure of theorem  [ thm : main ] would imply the existence of a minimal blowup solution ( see theorem  [ prop : existence min blowup sol ] ) .",
    "it is here that we perform the ` inductive step ' : the sequence of initial data can not split into more than one bubble of concentration , because this would violate the minimality of @xmath85 . in the language of @xcite , _ dichotomy",
    "_ can not occur .",
    "this argument requires that @xmath106 strictly decreases if either the mass or the energy is decreased ( cf .",
    "proposition  [ p : all about d](v ) and  ( vi ) ) .    because they are exact symmetries of our equation ,",
    "space and time translations can be employed directly to tackle these sources of non - compactness . however , the problem of scaling seems to have simply disappeared in the statements of proposition  [ prop : palais - smale ] and theorem  [ prop : existence min blowup sol ] .",
    "let us explain .",
    "both nonlinearities are mass supercritical ; correspondingly , solutions with bounded mass but living at very large length scales behave essentially linearly . by the strichartz inequality ,",
    "linear solutions obey the spacetime bound .",
    "thus solutions living at very large length scales can not arise as minimal blowup solutions .",
    "on the other hand , by the analysis of section  [ sec:6 ] , solutions living at very small length scales can not blow up either and so can not occur as minimal blowup solutions .",
    "naturally , if the sequence @xmath91 of solutions all live at intermediate length scales , there is no need to rescale in order to achieve subsequential convergence .",
    "theorem  [ prop : existence min blowup sol ] gives more than just the existence of a minimal blowup solution ( under the assumption that theorem  [ thm : main ] fails ) .",
    "it shows that any such minimal counter - example @xmath8 consists of a single well - localized bump .",
    "more precisely , it shows that such a solution @xmath8 is almost periodic modulo translations , that is , there is an @xmath2-valued function @xmath107 of time so that @xmath108 in fact , this very strong property of such minimal blowup solutions is a rather trivial consequence of our strong palais ",
    "smale condition .",
    "it is now that we finally see the true power of the induction on energy paradigm .",
    "it tells us where to center our virial identity and at what radius we can safely truncate ; the latter is dictated by compactness .",
    "there is one additional subtlety , however : we need to control how much @xmath107 moves . in proposition",
    "[ prop : p(u)=0 ] we observe that minimal blowup solutions have zero momentum .",
    "otherwise , one could apply a galilei boost , which preserves the mass and the blowup property , but reduces the energy . in proposition",
    "[ prop : control x(t ) ] we use this to constrain the motion of @xmath107 ; specifically , we show that @xmath109 as @xmath110 .",
    "this is sufficient to exploit a truncated version of the virial identity to show that is inconsistent with the region @xmath24 admitting an almost periodic solution .",
    "this is done in section  [ sec:8 ] . as our previous arguments show",
    "that failure of theorem  [ thm : main ] guarantees the existence of such a solution , this completes the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] .    by realizing the arguments laid out above , we will be able to show that scattering occurs on any region @xmath24 of the mass / energy plane with the following property : @xmath111 note that non - vanishing of the virial on such a larger set is needed to perform the induction argument we described .    in section  [ sec : virial ]",
    "we determine the largest @xmath24 region obeying ; this is the region appearing in theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "as we will see , one may determine this region by finding for each mass @xmath112 the least energy @xmath113 at which the virial vanishes .",
    "this is formalized in definition  [ d : rr defn ] .    from prior investigations ,",
    "it is reasonable to imagine that the boundary of the region @xmath24 is marked by solitons ; that is , the functions that achieve minimal energy among those with fixed mass and zero virial are solitons .",
    "we will prove that this is _ not _ the case for our model .",
    "we find this a startling new observation .",
    "it places a formidable limitation on existing technology and raises curious questions for further investigation ; most notably , what is the true extent of the mass / energy region where only scattering holds ?",
    "we are able to prove that for some values of the mass , functions with zero virial that achieve energy @xmath113 are precisely solitons , but for other values of the mass such functions are non - trivial rescalings of soliton profiles .",
    "these rescalings are _ not _ solitons in their own right !",
    "such non - soliton virial obstructions do not appear in earlier work .",
    "see theorem  [ t : rbdry ] for further information .",
    "theorem  [ t : mmr ] gives general information on the shape of the curve @xmath114 .",
    "let us now discuss the relation to the works @xcite , which considered the case where the highest nonlinearity is energy - critical and focusing .",

    "<S> we consider the cubic - quintic nonlinear schrdinger equation : @xmath0    in the first part of the paper , we analyze the one - parameter family of ground - state solitons associated to this equation with particular attention to the shape of the associated mass / energy curve . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we are able to characterize the kernel of the linearized operator about such solitons and to demonstrate that they occur as optimizers for a one - parameter family of inequalities of gagliardo  nirenberg type . building on this work , </S>",
    "<S> in the latter part of the paper we prove that scattering holds for solutions belonging to the region @xmath1 of the mass / energy plane where the virial is positive . </S>",
    "<S> we show this region is partially bounded by solitons but also by rescalings of solitons ( which are _ not _ soliton solutions in their own right ) . </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of rescaled solitons in this context is new and highlights an unexpected limitation of any virial - based methodology . </S>"
