    "the equivalence principle ( ep ) @xcite states the equivalence between inertial and gravitational mass .",
    "this fact is a mere coincidence in classical physics , but it has some important consequences , for example :    * the free fall of _ any _ object in the same gravity field depends only on their initial status and not on their composition or structure ; * it is impossible to detect the difference between a uniform static gravitational field and a uniform acceleration : free - fall and inertial motion are physically equivalent .    as a consequence ,",
    "the ep allows the geometrical description of spacetime , which is at the basis of general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "the weak form of the ep ( wep ) is limited to strong and electroweak interactions .",
    "it can be verified by measuring the free fall of test masses with different chemical compositions .",
    "tests are performed on ground with , for instance , torsion balances @xcite or in space with low earth orbits ( e.g.  with the microscope mission @xcite ) . + the strong form ( sep ) extends the validity of the weak principle to self - graviting bodies .",
    "the ep violation for the body @xmath3 can be parametrized as follows @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is the inertial ( gravitational ) mass , and @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the speed of light , and @xmath9 is the self - gravity energy , which is obtained by double - integrating over the mass of the body .",
    "the wep involves only the case @xmath10 and corresponds to @xmath11 , while the sep is valid , for each @xmath12 , when both @xmath13 and @xmath0 are equal to zero .    with experiments on ground ,",
    "the typical @xmath12 can be so small ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) that only the wep can effectively be tested .",
    "the only means by which the sep can be constrained is evidently in space involving celestial bodies .",
    "thanks to retroreflectors placed on the facing side of the moon it is possible to measure the earth - moon distance and detect a possible sep violation signal .",
    "this experiment was proposed by nordtvedt @xcite . in this case , a violation of the sep will introduce a signal in the earth - moon range , its amplitude being proportional to @xmath14 .    over the last 46 years , the lunar laser ranging ( llr ) project has carried out a long sequence of range measurements , and the precision on the earth - moon relative differential accelerations is currently@xcite @xmath15 = 1.3 \\times   10^{-13}$ ] , but this result includes possible violations of both sep and wep .",
    "since ground experiments can test only the weak form of the ep , the parameter @xmath0 can be measured only by using the results of both experiments , ground and llr .",
    "no disproofs of the sep have still been found and the error associated to @xmath0 is currently@xcite @xmath1=4.4 \\times 10^{-4}$ ] .",
    "the bepicolombo mission is expected to improve this result by about an order of magnitude@xcite  a prediction is given in the first part of this paper . instead , an alternative ranging experiment towards the sun - earth lagrangian points  recently proposed in ref .",
    " could easily reach the llr s performance in a very short time span , which is investigated in the second part of the paper .",
    "therefore we will describe two experiments for the estimation of @xmath0 .",
    "the first one in section [ sect2 ] is the well - known relativity experiment of the bepicolombo mission , while in section [ sect3 ] we will study the same measurement performed on range data between the earth and a spacecraft ( sc ) orbiting around a sun - earth lagrangian point .",
    "bepicolombo ( bc ) is a joint esa / jaxa mission to mercury with challenging objectives regarding geophysics , geodesy , and fundamental physics @xcite .",
    "currently , the launch is scheduled for the end of 2018 , with a nominal duration of one year plus a possible one - year extension .",
    "the mercury orbiter radioscience experiment ( more ) is one of the on - board experiments that focus on gravimetry , rotation and relativity @xcite .",
    "the goal is the measurement of key parameters by means of orbit determination techniques using the earth - mpo radio link observables , i.e.  range and range rate .",
    "the parameters for gravitation and rotation experiments are the mercury gravity field coefficients , love numbers , obliquity and libration .",
    "instead the relativity experiment consists in the measurement of the parametrized post - newtonian ( ppn ) parameters , which account for possible small deviations from gr ",
    "@xmath0 is one of them .",
    "all parameters will be estimated by a global nonlinear least - squares fitting of all the _ observed _ signals ( range , range - rate , accelerometer readings , etc . ) along with the _ computed _ signals that are calculated by using mathematical models as accurate as possible .",
    "the main characteristics of the radioscience experiment are summarized in table  [ tab2 ] . for further details",
    "the observed data of gravity and rotation experiments are primarily range - rate signals , which are poorly correlated with those of the relativity experiment , i.e.  earth - mpo range only , because the frequency domains are very different",
    ". since we are interested in the relativity experiment , we can neglect the motion of the mpo around mercury ( the orbital period is approximately 2  hrs ) and consider only the mercury - earth range .",
    "we aim at calculating the expected root - mean - square ( rms ) error of @xmath0 after the whole duration of the bc mission .",
    "since the dare are obviously not available , we need to simulate them . to this end",
    ", we are going present a simplified heliocentric analytical model that yields the perturbations on the earth - mercury range due to @xmath0 and all the parameters that are expected to correlate with .",
    "this is a typical fisher / covariance analysis : the rms of the parameters will be given by the square root of the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix .",
    "we adopt the notation of ref .",

    "planets are numbered from 1 ( mercury ) to 8 ( neptune ) , while 0 refers to the sun .",
    "we also define the gravitational parameters for all bodies in the same way : @xmath19 .",

    "it is an apparent term , essentially a perturbation on the acceleration of the sun with respect to the solar system barycenter ( ssb ) .",
    "note that there is a non - zero signal even if @xmath10 , which means that the experiment can be done also if the body @xmath3 is a drag - free test mass , e.g.  a sc with an onboard accelerometer ( see section [ sect3 ] ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the signals due to other ppn parameters , such as @xmath27 , along with the effect due to @xmath28 ( the rate of change of @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 ( gravitational `` flattening '' of the sun ) and the initial conditions of earth and mercury ( see ref . for details ) , must all be calculated and included in the global fit . also from eq .",
    "( [ eqr0i ] ) , a high correlation among planetary perturbations ( proportional to @xmath31s ) and sep violation is evident .    in order to avoid systematic effects",
    ", the @xmath31s must be added to the set of parameters to be estimated , and their errors must be taken into account in terms of prior constraints in the global covariance analysis .",

    ", their relative errors can be very large ( 50% or more ) .    to summarize",
    ", we will calculate the signatures on the earth - mercury range due to all the following effects :    1 .",
    "initial conditions of earth and mercury ; 2 .",

    "sun s quadrupole coefficient : free parameter @xmath30 , whereas higher order terms are negligible .",
    "the ppn parameter @xmath39 , which is related to the curvature produced by unit rest mass , has not been considered here for simplicity . however , this is not reductive since the best estimate of @xmath39 ( @xmath40=2.0\\times 10^{-6}$ ] ) is expected to be given right after the dedicated superior conjunction experiment ( sce ) during the cruise phase of bc . the value of the nordtvedt parameter can be derived from the nordtvedt quation @xmath41 which will be used as a prior .",
    "we also neglect the preferred frame parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 since they are poorly correlated with the other parameters of the relativity experiment , in particular @xmath0 . for more details compare the results of experiments a , b , c and d in ref .. finally , we assume that the unperturbed orbits of planets and asteroids are circular with radius @xmath44 , and co - planar .",
    "we define @xmath45 as the vector of all @xmath46 parameters , @xmath47 is the displacement from the circular reference orbit @xmath48 for the @xmath3th - body due to the ( linearized ) force @xmath49 relative to the ( small ) parameter @xmath50 .",

    "solve the hill s equations for @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the mean motion of the @xmath3th - body ; 4 .   finally calculate the earth - mercury range as @xmath59 where @xmath60 and the factor @xmath61 can be rewritten in legendre polynomials @xmath62 @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "due to visibility windows , range and range - rate data contain several gaps .",
    "a gap occurs approximately every day and lasts about 9.3 h. a low - frequency sampling ( @xmath65 hz ) is therefore sufficient for our purposes since the involved signals have frequencies of the same order of planetary mean motions .",
    "we can then calculate the range at epochs @xmath66 and obtain the looked - after @xmath67 fisher matrix , or _",

    "if we were to compare this result with the `` idealistic case '' where the @xmath31s have all zero errors @xcite , we would find that the uncertainties degrade the precision of most of the ppn parameters by about an order of magnitude .",

    "when testing for a sep violation , the advantage of the ranging between two planets over that between earth and moon is twofold : a longer baseline ( @xmath106 vs @xmath107 au ) and @xmath108 instead of @xmath109 .",
    "this in turn implies a much bigger ranging signal amplitude ( about three orders of magnitudes better than the nordtvedt effect @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , even if the time span and the precision of the data will be worse , a bigger self - energy and a stronger signal will certainly allow better measurements of @xmath0 .",

    "the sc s equation of motion relative to the sun can be obtained by eq .",

    "a combined measurement , @xmath134 , gives instead an improved constraint of @xmath135 , which would be comparable with those already achieved by llr .",
    "it is worth noting that the performances could be much improved if data were integrated over time and over the number of satellites flying around either of the two lagrangian points .",
    "we point out that some systematics ( gravitational perturbations of other planets or figure effects ) are much more in control compared to other experiments .",
    "this sc ranging would be a new and complementary probe to constrain the strong equivalence principle in space .",
    "in this work we described two experiments devoted to testing the sep in space . in both cases we performed a global covariance analysis based on simulated data .",
    "the first test is the bc relativity experiment : we calculated the effect of the uncertainties on the masses of the solar system s bodies on the estimation of ppn parameters .",
    "we forecast a degradation for the rmss of all parameters , including @xmath0 for the strong equivalence principle , of about an order of magnitude with respect to the nominal case where uncertainties are not taken into account .",
    "nonetheless this result , in terms of @xmath0 , represents an improvement of a factor 10 over the current precision achieved by llr .    in the second part of the paper we calculated the signal due to sep violation on the ranging between a ground station and a sc orbiting near an earth - sun collinear lagrangian point . with a covariance analysis based on a 5 years mission",
    ", we forecast an rms error for @xmath0 that would be around the same level of current measurements by llr and ground experiments .",
