    "the observation of formation of nanocrystals ( ncs ) by annealing of silicon dioxide films having excess si or ge has attracted attention due to optical and electronic properties of such nanostructures  @xcite . in particular , ge ncs embedded in amorphous silicon oxide ( a - sio ) films have been subject of study , because of low temperature of formation , compatibility with standard integrated circuit fabrication processes and for their potential applications in optoelectronic and memory devices .",
    "the ncs are candidates as storage media for electron storage cells in flash memory devices  @xcite . since many parameters of ncs such as density , size and composition can be adjusted by proper choice of fabrication parameters , they offer flexibility in design of nc flash memory cells",

    "recent studies have proposed a model describing the storage of carriers in nc - mos devices assuming storage in deep - traps @xcite associated with ncs and trap energy level engineering was investigated to improve device performance .    in this paper , we investigate an alternative mechanism for carrier storage by assuming carrier storage in nc energy levels instead of deep traps . based on this assumption , we present a theoretical model that includes the effect of nc dimensions and density to calculate the discharge dynamics .",

    "therefore , they may have a larger quasi - fermi energy for large ncs than smaller ncs at a given @xmath0 . since carriers near the quasi - fermi level dominate the discharge , the discharge current increases rapidly when @xmath40 as is clearly seen in the data for the device with 7.4 nm diameter ncs , for which @xmath41 v. this is in accordance with the numerical solution shown in solid curves of fig.[dischargedensities ] .",
