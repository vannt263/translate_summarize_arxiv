    "ultracold atomic quantum gases are many - body systems where a wide variety of macroscopic quantum phenomena is observable @xcite . for the original bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) of alkali atoms ,",
    "it has been sufficient to describe the dominant two - particle interaction by a short - range and isotropic contact potential @xmath1 where @xmath2 stands for the mass of the particles .",
    "the s - wave scattering length @xmath3 is tuned by using a so - called feshbach resonance @xcite , where it can be varied over a broad range via an external magnetic field .",
    "recently , a bec has also been realized in a dipolar quantum gas of @xmath0cr atoms @xcite where the magnetic dipole moments are around six times larger than those of alkali atoms .",
    "therefore , the physical properties of such a chromium bec also depend on a long - range and anisotropic magnetic dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "other many - body systems with dipolar interactions are , for instance , rydberg atoms @xcite or atomic condensates where a strong electric field induces electric dipole moments of the order of @xmath4 debye @xcite .",
    "permanent dipole moments in heteronuclear molecules are much larger with typical values of 1 debye , so their dipolar effects could be a few hundred times stronger than those of chromium atoms @xcite .",
    "such a gas of ultracold heteronuclear molecules is produced either by sophisticated cooling and trapping techniques @xcite or by photoassociation @xcite .",

    "note that this dipole - dipole interaction contains , apart from the usual first term , an additional contact term , which renormalizes the divergence at the origin .",
    "the latter contribution has been overlooked in most textbooks of electrodynamics , but is taken into account in more accurate representations as , for instance , in ref .",
    "the dipolar interaction strength can be tuned for induced dipole moments by varying the field strength and for permanent dipoles by using rotating magnetic ( electric ) fields @xcite . combining this rotation technique with feshbach resonances , will allow in the near future experiments where the interaction varies from purely contact to purely dipolar .",
    "the anisotropic dipole - dipole interaction gives rise to new condensate properties as , for instance , a characteristic anisotropic deformation of the expanding bec which has recently been resolved experimentally in ref .",
    "also other interesting dipolar phenomena are accessible experimentally as , for instance , the occurrence of a maxon - roton in the excitation of dipolar bec @xcite or the instability of the ground state of dipolar becs @xcite .",
    "+ in the present article we investigate how the critical temperature of a bec is shifted due to the dipole - dipole interaction ( [ mint ] ) . to this end",
    "we consider a dilute gas trapped in an arbitrary harmonic potential @xmath8 where @xmath9 denote the respective trap frequencies .",
    "furthermore , we assume that , due to an additional external field , the dipole moments @xmath6 of all constituents are oriented along one axis , i.e. they are uniformly described by @xmath10 .",
    "we expect that the critical temperature depends crucially on the spherical angles @xmath11 and @xmath12 which characterize the orientation of the dipole moments with respect to the harmonic trap axes .",
    "the temperature shift should have local extrema when the dipole moments are parallel to one of the harmonic trap axes as is illustrated in figure  [ cases ] .",
    "for instance , if the frequencies are ordered according to @xmath13 , this leads to an additional interaction which is attractive along the 3-axis , repulsive along the 1-axis and can be both attractive or repulsive along the 2-axis .",
    "therefore , the particle density in the harmonic trap is increased ( decreased ) in case  3 ( case  1 ) in comparison with a pure contact interaction .",
    "thus , we expect a resulting positive ( negative ) shift of the critical temperature due to the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "furthermore , we follow ref .  @xcite and suggest to determine differences of the critical temperatures in the three configurations , as then the influence of the isotropic contact interaction cancels . consequently , those differences represent a clear signal of the anisotropic dipole - dipole interaction . + we start our detailed analysis by briefly reviewing the calculation of the bose - einstein condensation temperature for a dilute ideal bose gas in section  [ frr ] .",
    "subsequently , we treat the influence of both interactions ( [ cint ] ) and ( [ mint ] ) in lowest order perturbatively .",
    "this is justified as the confinement of the harmonic trapping potential ( [ ht ] ) removes critical long - wavelength fluctuations and reduces the fraction of atoms taking part in nonperturbative physics at the transition point @xcite .",
    "therefore , we determine in section  [ gfe ] within first - order perturbation theory how the grand - canonical free energy and , thus , the particle number equation change under the influence of an arbitrary two - particle interaction potential . additionally , we calculate in lowest perturbative order the location of the critical point where the phase transition from a bose gas to a bec occurs . to this end",
    "we extract the critical chemical potential from the first - order contribution to the self - energy .",
    "this procedure is , in principle , self - consistent and corresponds to the hartree - fock mean - field theory .",
    "however , we determine the critical chemical potential only in the leading order and use it to obtain the critical temperture shift .",
    "note that this provides a reliable prediction since it is only linear in the interaction strength . due to the ginzburg criterion",

    "in section  [ mii ] we specialize our result to the model interaction potential ( [ cint ] ) and ( [ mint ] ) and combine it in section  [ ct ] in order to derive the leading shift of the critical temperature .",
