    "during latest decades , we have seen large numbers of publications on the use of pareto - lev and other heavy - tailed distributions in finance ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite and references there ) . one of the key authors that initiated this , was mandelbrot .",
    "he mentioned that gaussian distribution can not provide a solid explanation for observed large amount of ` outliers ' - in other words , the number of observations for which absolute value of deviation from empirical mean is bigger than @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is empirical variance .",
    "aparently , mandelbrot considered stable distributions as a unique alternative to gaussian family basing on the fact of classical limit theorem for independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) random variables , or , equivalently , on stability property . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we show that stable distributions can not explain such a large number of outliers either .",
    "the connection to classical limit theorem for a non - random number of random summands seems to be questionable .",
    "a more natural perspective comes from the use of limit theorem for a random number of random variables .",
    "in this section we look at the probability of observing outliers in the case of distributions belonging to a domain of attraction of strictly stable distribution .",
    "specifically , suppose that @xmath2 is a sequence of i.i.d .",
    "random variables .",
    "denote by @xmath3 their empirical mean and empirical variance correspondingly .",
    "let @xmath4 be a fixed number .",
    "we are interested in the following probability @xmath5 our aim here is to prove the following theorem .",
    "[ th1 ] suppose that @xmath2 is a sequence of i.i.d .",
    "random variables belonging to a domain of attraction of strictly stable random variable with index of stability @xmath6 .",
    "then @xmath7    since @xmath8 belong to the domain of attraction of strictly stable random variable with index @xmath9 , it is also true that @xmath10 belong to the domain of attraction of one - sided stable distribution with index @xmath11 .",
    "\\1 ) consider at first the case @xmath12 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath13{}{\\longrightarrow } a={{\\rm i}\\kern-0.18em{\\rm e}}x_1 $ ] and @xmath14{}{\\longrightarrow } \\infty$ ] .",
    "we have @xmath15 @xmath16{}{\\longrightarrow } 0.\\ ] ]    \\2 ) suppose now that @xmath17 . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath18 as @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 is @xmath21-stable random variable , and the sign @xmath22 is used for asymptotic equivalence .",
    "similarly , @xmath23 where @xmath24 has one - sided positive stable distribution with index @xmath11 .",
    "we have @xmath25 @xmath26{}{\\longrightarrow } 0.\\ ] ]    \\3 ) in the case @xmath27 we deal with cauchy distribution .",
    "the proof for this case is very similar to that in the case 2 ) .",
    "we omit the details .",
    "let us note that for the case of distributions having finite second moment and non - compact support , the probability ( [ eq1 ] ) has a positive limit as @xmath19 .",
    "indeed , if the second moment is finite then both @xmath28 and @xmath29 have finite limits @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the probability ( [ eq1 ] ) converges to @xmath32 as @xmath19 because of non - compactness of support of the distribution .",
    "therefore , it is clear that the explanation of presence a large number of outliers can not be provided by the heaviness of the tails .",
    "although the results of section [ s2 ] show that asymptotically the probability of presence of a large number of outliers is negligible , we may still have doubts for not too large samples .",
    "however , the samples in practice are not too small .",
    "so , basing on actual observed data , we can consider the sample size @xmath33 of order @xmath34 as typical one .",
    "we simulated @xmath35 samples of size @xmath33 ( @xmath33 is growing from 1,000 to 25,000 with step 2,000 ) and calculated the estimate of probability @xmath36 given by ( [ eq1 ] ) for @xmath37 .",
    "the behavior of this probability as a function of @xmath33 is reflected on figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "blue line corresponds to symmetric stable distribution with @xmath38 ; red line - to standard gaussian distribution .",
    "we see that the probability @xmath36 for @xmath38-stable symmetric distribution becomes smaller that for gaussian case starting at about @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , we can not expect many outliers for such stable distribution for typical sample size .     for @xmath37 .",
    "blue line corresponds to symmetric stable distribution with @xmath38 ; red line - to standard gaussian distribution ]    \\2 .",
    "again , we simulated @xmath35 samples of size @xmath33 ( @xmath33 is again growing from 1,000 to 25,000 with step 2,000 ) and calculated the estimate of probability @xmath36 given by ( [ eq1 ] ) for @xmath40 .",
    "the behavior of this probability as a function of @xmath33 is plotted on figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "blue line corresponds to symmetric stable distribution with @xmath41 ; red line - to standard gaussian distribution .",
    "we see that the probability @xmath36 for @xmath41-stable symmetric distribution becomes smaller than that for gaussian case starting from about @xmath42 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath36 for the case @xmath37 is much slower .",
    "for example , @xmath43 for @xmath41-stable symmetric distribution versus @xmath44 for gaussian distribution .",
    "in this situation , we can not say that stable distribution provides less outliers that gaussian law .",
    "but will the corresponding number of outliers be sufficient for the predicted figures to be in agreement with observed data ?",
    "unfortunately , there are only a few papers giving observed number of outliers , that is an estimate of probability @xmath36 for @xmath37 . some data of this kind may be found in @xcite , table 3 .",
    "corresponding estimates for probabilities @xmath45 given there vary from 0.009 to 0.013 . for symmetric stable distribution with @xmath46 , this probability is @xmath43 .",
    "we see that it is too small to explain the number of outliers in table 3 from @xcite .",
    "let us note that similar simulations for different values of parameters and sample size are given in @xcite .",
    "we shall not discuss them here .     for @xmath40 .",
    "blue line corresponds to symmetric stable distribution with @xmath41 ; red line - to standard gaussian distribution ]",
    "lately , _ tempered stable distributions _ have been growing increasingly popular .",
    "the idea of such distribution lies in altering the tails of stable laws by exponential tails starting from a certain point of distribution s support . of course",
    ", the probability @xmath36 in this case will not converge to zero anymore .",
    "however , one may expect that this probability will be small if the point of the tails alteration is far from the origin , since tempered distribution will be close to stable in this case .",
    "simulations support this opinion .",
    "let us consider only the case of symmetric tempered stable distributions having characteristic functions @xmath47 for @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 .    on figure [ fig2a ] , plot of limit probability @xmath51",
    "is given for the distribution ( [ eqa ] ) as a function of parameters @xmath21 and @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "this plot shows that the probabilities are too small to explain the presence of large number of outliers .     as a function of parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 . ]",
    "here we discuss a way of constructing from a distribution another one having a higher probability to observe outliers .",
    "we call this procedure `` put tail down '' .",
    "let @xmath56 be a probability distribution function of random variable @xmath57 having finite second moment @xmath58 and such that @xmath59 for all @xmath60 . take a parameter @xmath61 and",
    "fix it . define a new function @xmath62 where @xmath63 for @xmath64 , and @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath67 is probability distribution function for any @xmath61 .",
    "of course , @xmath68 also has finite second moment @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "however , @xmath71 .",
    "let @xmath72 be a random variable with probability distribution function @xmath68 .",
    "then @xmath73 denoting @xmath74 rewrite previous equality in the form @xmath75 for @xmath72 to have more outliers than @xmath57 it is sufficient that @xmath76 there are many cases in which inequality ( [ eq4 ] ) is true for sufficiently large values of @xmath77 .",
    "let us mention two of them .    1",
    ".   random variable @xmath57 has exponential tail .",
    "more precisely , @xmath78 for some positive constants @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "in this case , inequality ( [ eq4 ] ) is equivalent for sufficiently large @xmath77 to @xmath81 which is obviously true for large @xmath77 .",
    "2 .   @xmath82 has power tail , that is @xmath83 , where @xmath84 in view of existence of finite second moment .",
    "simple calculations show that ( [ eq4 ] ) is equivalent as @xmath85 to @xmath86 the last inequality is true for @xmath87 .",
    "let us note that the function @xmath68 has a jump at zero .",
    "however , one can obtain similar effect without such jump by using a smoothing procedure , that is by approximating @xmath68 by smooth functions .",
    "`` put tail down '' procedure allows us to obtain more outliers in view of two its elements .",
    "first element consists in changing the tail by smaller , but proportional to previous with coefficient @xmath88 .",
    "the second element consist in moving a part of mass into origin ( or into a small neighborhood of it ) , which reduces the variance .",
    "one of the arguments used to support the use of stable distributions in finance is that the observations may be considered as sums of a large number of random variables .",
    "however , to have the convergence to stable distribution , the summands themselves must have heavy tails , which seems to be unnatural .",
    "moreover , as we saw in sections [ s2 ] , [ s3 ] , the probability to observe large number of outliers is not in agreement with real data .",
    "however , alternatives to gaussian distribution are not restricted by stable distributions only .",
    "there are limit laws for the sums of i.i.d .",
    "random variables for _ random number of summands_. the theory of such limit distributions has been developed by robbins , dobrushin , gnedenko and others .",
    "the description of this theory can be found in the book @xcite .",
    "for some new results , see @xcite . as shown in these publications , the sums of a random number of i.i.d .",
    "random variables converges to so - called @xmath89-normal distribution .",
    "the form of this distribution depends on the law for number of summands . in the case of geometric distribution for the number of summands the limit law is laplace distribution instead of gaussian . for the case of",
    "transformed negative binomial distribution for the number of summands the role of gaussian law is played by symmetric gamma distribution .",
    "many other examples are given in @xcite .",
    "all such distributions have finite second moment .",
    "for many of them , the probability ( [ eq2 ] ) is essentially higher than for gaussian law .",
    "for example , laplace distribution gives the limit value of probability @xmath36 for @xmath37 equal to @xmath90 , versus @xmath44 for gaussian distribution .",
    "our suggestion is that such distributions are good alternatives to gaussian and stable laws ."
