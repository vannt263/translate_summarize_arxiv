    "current observational data @xcite-@xcite suggest that the cosmological model of a universe with only baryonic matter has to be modified . in the easiest way",
    ", the model can be reconciled with observations by the introduction of a cosmological constant @xmath8 and of considerable amount of dark matter ( @xmath9cdm model ) . because the energy densities of both baryonic and dark matter decrease during cosmological evolution , the cosmological constant will dominate the late - time evolution .",
    "this process was first suggested for the explanation of ia supernovae data , which suggest that our universe has reached an accelerating phase . in a @xmath8-dominated universe ,",
    "the luminosity distance increases faster with redshift than in the model without @xmath9 @xcite , exactly as required by the supernova data .",
    "generally , the agreement with experiments can be achieved by introducing a dark energy component of the universe , which replaces @xmath9 .",
    "such a dark energy in general does not clump .",
    "a recent analysis @xcite shows that a dark energy model with varying dark energy density going through a transition from an accelerating to a decelerating phase at redshift @xmath10 fits well the observational data .",
    "based on observations , the dark energy equation of state @xmath11 is within about @xmath12 krauss .    it has been expected for some time that alternative gravitational theories , motivated by string / m - theory could replace dark matter and dark energy by geometric effects . the curved generalizations ( see for example the review @xcite ) of the original randall - sundrum type ii model @xcite consist of a hypersurface with tension @xmath13 ( the brane ) , representing our observable universe , embedded in a @xmath14-dimensional space - time ( the bulk ) . gravitational dynamics on the brane",
    "is governed by an effective einstein equation @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the sources of gravity in the effective einstein equation include terms due to the asymmetric embedding of the brane into the bulk @xcite , non - standard model fields in the bulk , and even quantum corrections approximated as induced gravity effects @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the most relevant source term for early cosmology is a quadratic source term in the energy - momentum tensor @xcite .",
    "this term dominates over the linear term before the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) . in the simplest case of cosmological symmetries and suppression of the energy exchange between the brane and the bulk and whenever the bulk contains a static black hole , the weyl curvature of the bulk generates a so - called weyl fluid effect on the brane . in fig 1 of our companion paper @xcite ( to be referred in what follows as paper i ) we classify the different brane - world theories and their inter - relations . they are divided into two branches , one containing the original randall - sundrum type ii model ( brane1 ) and the other the flat dgp model ( brane2 ) .",
    "the model with weyl fluid belongs to the brane 2 branch .",
    "supernova data were confronted with the induced gravity models @xcite-@xcite . when they are combined with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) baryonic peak ,",
    "these seem to rule out the flat dgp models @xcite , @xcite . however it was argued in @xcite that the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) shift parameter can over - turn this conclusion .",
    "structure formation and cmb were also considered in the dgp models in ref .",
    "roystrukt .",
    "most recently , the authors of @xcite tested the accelerating phase of the universe s expansion with a comparison of the models and the supernova data .",
    "they have tested the @xmath9cdm model , the dgp model and three @xmath15cdm models with equations of state where @xmath16 ( i ) was constant with scale factor @xmath17 , ( ii ) varied as @xmath18 for redshifts probed by the supernovae but fixed at @xmath19 for earlier epochs , and ( iii ) varied as @xmath20 since the recombination .",
    "their main conclusion is that all the five examined models explain equally well the acceleration , and none of them could be selected as a preferred model , based on the ia - type supernova data .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have compared the predictions of the flat brane1 and brane2 models to the gold @xcite and supernova legacy survey ( snls )  @xcite supernova data sets , incorporating the baryon acoustic peaks into the analysis .",
    "these brane - world models in certain parameter range ( when their induced gravity parameter @xmath21 is small ; the flat dgp models falling outside this range ) are satisfied by both supernova data sets .",
    "the brane1 models fit better to the snls data , while the brane2 models fit better to the gold data set .",
    "since the analysis depends very weakly on the bulk cosmological constant @xmath22 , the value of @xmath23 was fixed at zero . with this modification ,",
    "the brane1 model fits better to the snls data than the @xmath9cdm model and fits comparably well to the gold data .",
    "the same conclusion holds for the brane2 model . in the analysis of @xcite",
    "the dark radiation dimensionless parameter @xmath1 is switched off .",
    "using two recent supernova data sets , the cmb shift parameter , and the baryon oscillation peaks , the authors of ref . @xcite",
    "have found that the ldgp model ( a subclass of the brane1 models with the effective energy density having a phantom - like behavior due to extra - dimensional effects , see fig 1 of paper i ) fits the observations if it is very close to the @xmath9cdm model .",
    "the modification of the ldgp model with respect to the @xmath9cdm model appears in the form of a linear term in the friedmann equation , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the hubble parameter and @xmath26 a crossover scale .",
    "this model includes a cosmological constant , possibly screened by the modified gravity , however the comparison with observations sets strong constraints on the screening .",
    "the first comprehensive study of the generalized randall - sundrum type ii ( rs ) brane - worlds tested against astronomical data was presented in ref .",
    "agreement with earlier supernova data has been established in the presence of a cosmological constant . in this analysis the dark radiation from the bulk was switched off ( @xmath27 ) and the energy - momentum squared term was kept . under these assumptions , for flat spatial sections and matter parameter @xmath28 the maximum likelihood method gave @xmath29 for the parameter characterizing the source term quadratic in the energy - momentum .",
    "this in turn implies a tiny value of the brane tension , which is disfavored by generic brane - world arguments .",
    "moreover , much lower values for @xmath30 emerge from both cmb and bbn .",
    "in contrast to refs . @xcite and @xcite the analysis of @xcite keeps both @xmath31 and @xmath1 , the latter obeying @xmath32 .",
    "the best fit is obtained at @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 . with the high value of the brane tension set by either ( a ) the value of the @xmath37-dimensional",
    "planck constant and sub - millimeter tests @xcite on possible deviations from newton s law ( in units @xmath38 these give @xmath39 tev@xmath40 see @xcite , @xcite ) , ( b ) astrophysical considerations @xmath41 mev@xmath40 gm or ( c ) bbn constraints @xmath42 mev@xmath40 nucleosynthesis , the quadratic source term barely counts at late - times in the cosmological evolution .",
    "given the high limits for the values of @xmath13 , in any realistic model @xmath43 can be safely ignored .",
    "this is a crucial difference of our forthcoming analysis as compared to the one presented in refs . @xcite and @xcite , where the corresponding cosmological parameter @xmath43 was kept .",
    "the next question is whether the source term arising from the weyl curvature of the bulk may be kept , in other worlds , whether @xmath44 .",
    "the weyl curvature of the bulk gives an energy density @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the gravitational coupling constant . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the bbn limits constrained the dark radiation component as @xmath47 .",
    "combining this with cmb constraints reduces this range to @xmath48 . here",
    "@xmath49 is the energy density of the background photons .",
    "another constraint for the value of the dark radiation at bbn was derived in @xcite as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the energy density contributed by a single , two - component massless neutrino .",
    "this constraint was derived for high values of the @xmath14-dimensional plank mass .    in the simplest case",
    "the weyl source term evolves as a radiation , thus its present value is obviously tiny .",
    "this is the reason why all mentioned references @xcite and @xcite comparing rs brane - worlds with observations disregard dark radiation . but is this a necessary assumption ? formulating the question the other way around : if we include even a small component of dark radiation into the late - time universe model we face a serious problem . due to the fact that the energy density of dark radiation decreases as @xmath52 ( compared to that of matter which is @xmath53 ) , even an amount of dark radiation of the same order as the amount of baryonic matter nowadays implies dark radiation dominance in the past , for example during structure formation .",
    "this conclusion is contradicted by numerical simulations , which favorize cold dark matter as the dominant component of the universe during structure formation @xcite .",
    "however we can generalize the validity of the model by lifting the requirement of a _ constant _ mass @xmath54 in the dark radiation energy density .",
    "a constant @xmath54 implies a static schwarzschild - anti de sitter bulk and no energy exchange between the brane and the bulk .",
    "therefore dark radiation is a manifestation of an equilibrium configuration with a static bulk , and it may be well possible that such a situation is reached only at the latest stages of the evolution of the brane - world universe . whenever @xmath54 depends on a certain , non - zero power of @xmath17 , the evolution of the energy density of the weyl source term evolves in a non - standard way , allowing to escape from the argument of a small weyl fluid left nowadays .",
    "we propose here the lwrs ( lambda - weyl fluid - randall - sundrum ) model , a specific _ rs model with i ) cosmological constant , ii ) the brane radiating away energy during various stages of the cosmological evolution , characterized by the index _",
    "@xmath6 _ and iii ) a weyl fluid depending on the actiul value of _",
    "@xmath6 _ during the latest stage of cosmological evolution _",
    ", which can be tested by supernova observations",
    ". for the inclusion of the lwrs model in the classification of brane - world models , see fig 1 of paper i.     the lwrs model takes into account the possibility of an energy exchange between the brane and the bulk .",
    "this idea is not new . indeed",
    ", it was already proposed that during an inflationary phase on the brane radiation is emitted and black holes thermally nucleate in the bulk @xcite .",
    "later on , but still in the high energy regime , the brane radiates such that the _ mass function _ of the bulk black hole increases with @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "this means that the weyl source term becomes a constant in this era .",
    "the brane continues to radiate away energy during structure formation palstructure , a process leading to a bulk black hole mass function @xmath56 , with @xmath57 .",
    "( other models with the brane radiating energy into the bulk are also known @xcite . )    for @xmath58  the weyl fluid is known as dark radiation , for @xmath59 it gives the correct growth factor during structure formation .",
    "for @xmath60 it is indistinguishable from dark matter and a cosmological constant , respectively@xmath61 therefore pure dark radiation can emerge only in the low-@xmath62 limit , while at earlier times a dynamic bulk - brane interaction governed by energy exchange should be present .",
    "as type ia supernovae result from the explosion of white dwarf stars with identical mass , they show remarkable similarities . by employing well established calibration methods",
    ", one can calculate the maximal luminosity of the object ( in the reference system of the explosion ) .",
    "this is done by analyzing the time - dependent variation of the emitted luminosity and the spectrum , a method known as the multi - color light curve analysis @xcite , @xcite . in this process",
    "the observed parameters , the _ shapeof the light curve _  and the _ spectral distribution of the emission _ have to be converted into the reference system of the host galaxy . for distant supernovae",
    "this translates to take into account the time dilation and the so - called @xmath63-correction @xcite .",
    "while these methods depend on @xmath62 , they are independent on the specific cosmological model . after performing these corrections , we have well - calibrated maximal luminosities for the supernovae of type ia and in consequence",
    "they are considered as standard candles .    in 2003 a list of @xmath64@xmath62 data pairs were published for 230 supernovae of type ia @xcite , and 60 of them had low absoprtion ( i.e. @xmath65 ) and cosmological redshift ( @xmath66 ) . to give result which can easily be compared to earlier works , we also involve this selected low - absorption data set for the most of the examinations .",
    "the basic supernova data we use here is the improved gold set @xcite , which was released in 2006 .",
    "we confront with supernova observations several models from paper i. in fig [ fig3 ] we represent graphically on both logarithmic and linear scales their luminosity distance - redshift relations up to @xmath67 .",
    "the plots are for @xmath68 and@xmath69 ( according to the combined analysis of the sdss and wmap 1-year data in ref @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the luminosity distance - redshift relation is shown for the following models :    * the lwrs model ( the perturbative solution given by eqs .",
    "( 56 ) , ( 60)-(61 ) , ( 63 ) , ( 65 ) and ( 67 ) of paper i , with @xmath70 and for @xmath5 ) for the two values of the late - time dark radiation @xmath71 and @xmath72  ( the curves 1 and 3 , respectively ) .",
    "the latter models contain a brane which radiates energy at early times ( for @xmath73 ) and during structure formation , such that a bulk black hole is formed and its mass increases continuously .",

    "in the absence of a known mechanism for changing @xmath6 , we examine here the cases when @xmath187 and @xmath188 hold throughout the cosmological evolution , up to nowadays . for this",
    "we confront these models with the gold  2006 set exactly as described before . to preserve the validity of the perturbative solution , the range of @xmath1 was selected to be @xmath189@xmath190 , and we probed the range @xmath191@xmath192 of @xmath0 .",
    "the assumption for flatness was kept , too .",
    "the results are qualitatively similar to the @xmath5 case .",
    "the remarkable difference is that the peak of the minimum turned into a trough , which lies aslope in the @xmath7@xmath1 space .",
    "this means that instead of a district solution , a complete model family exists in both cases , which can equally well explain the supernova data .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath193 is less in the @xmath187 model as compared to @xmath5 , and is very small if @xmath188 .",
    "the @xmath27 case is the @xmath9cdm model where these model intersect .",
    "the steeper slope of the minimum trough thus allows a much lower range of @xmath0 in the @xmath187 , and especially in the @xmath188 models , with a value close to @xmath194 . on the other hand",
    ", the range of @xmath1 gets more and more wide with increasing @xmath6 , which results in the conclusion that the presence of @xmath112 is mathematically plausible , and they have to be accounted for in rs cosmology .    due to the higher slopes of the 1-@xmath119 and 2-@xmath119 contours in these @xmath195 models , @xmath0 is much less affected by the weyl fluid , while @xmath1 can have various values in the detriment of @xmath196 .",
    "therefore the weyl fluid can explain some of the dark energy .    , but for the @xmath197 models.,height=453 ]    , but for the @xmath198 models.,height=453 ]",
    "the luminosity distance given in paper i as function of redshift in terms of elementary functions and elliptical integrals of first and second type for various brane - world models with weyl fluid was confronted with the available supernova data sets , including the gold2006 data @xcite .",
    "the tested models were :    \\(a ) the models with randall - sundrum fine - tuning , discussed in section 4 of paper i , with a considerable amount of dark radiation as a bulk effect , and a high value of the brane tension .",
    "\\(b ) the two models discussed in subsection 5.1 of paper i , which obey @xmath199 , have no dark radiation and were integrable in terms of elementary functions .",
    "\\(c ) the lwrs models ( subsection 5.2 of paper i ) , with a brane cosmological constant , for which the luminosity distance could be given analytically as function of redshift to first order accuracy in the dark radiation .",
    "( due to its smallness , the source term @xmath31 quadratic in the energy density was suppressed in the perturbative models of paper i. )    the brane - world models ( a ) although interesting for historical reasons , do not comply with observations .",
    "even if we introduce an extremely high amount of dark radiation @xmath77 , tentatively replacing the cosmological constant in the energy balance @xmath200 , these models are quickly outruled by supernova data ( curve 5 of fig [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "dark radiation is not capable to replace the cosmological constant in producing a late - time acceleration , since it scales as usual radiation .",
    "the more we go back in the past , the higher becomes its domination over matter",
    ". therefore a cosmological constant or dark energy is still needed in the generalized randall - sundrum type ii models .",
    "our analysis has also dismissed immediately the model ( b ) with @xmath76 .",
    "surprisingly , the other toy model ( b ) with @xmath201 was in good agreement with the gold2006 data , but ruled out by its low value of the brane tension , similarly as the models discussed in ref .",
    "a low brane tension is in disagreement with various upper limits set by cosmological and astrophysical tests .",
    "the perturbative approach of subsection 5.2 of paper i can be considered valid for a weyl fluid with @xmath202 . in this range",
    "the lwrs brane - world models ( c ) were confronted with supernova data and for @xmath203 the dark radiation with significant negative energy density ruled out .",
    "the fact that a positive dark radiation ( corresponding to a bulk black hole rather than to a bulk naked singularity ) is favoured by the presently available best supernova data is in accordance with the early behavior of the rs model with late - time dark radiation , where the brane radiating away energy in early times leads to a black hole , which can further grow during structure formation .",
    "the remaining lwrs brane - world models with @xmath5 and @xmath1 between @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( and @xmath204 changed accordingly ) turned out to be excellent candidates for describing our universe , as they show remarkable agreement with the gold2006 supernova data sets . if @xmath205 is allowed to vary in the range @xmath206 , the preferred values are @xmath207 , @xmath208 .",
    "the preferred cosmological parameters determined by comparing the lwrs model with @xmath5 with supernova data alone are in perfect accordance with the wmap 3-year data . indeed according to ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath209 and @xmath210 from which @xmath211 emerge .",
    "the value of @xmath212 determined by comparing the lwrs model with the supernova data alone is well in the middle of the domain allowed by the wmap 3 year data .",
    "we have then proved that the preferred value of @xmath145 is compatible with the known history of the universe if the brane radiates away energy into the bulk during a relatively short period of the cosmological evolution .",
    "such a process occurring between @xmath213 and @xmath131 could increase the amount of dark energy today with a factor of @xmath214 as compared to the non - radiating brane , exactly as required by the lwrs model with @xmath5 .",
    "the lwrs models with @xmath215(@xmath216 )  are identical with the @xmath2cdm model with the only difference that some fraction of the dark matter ( of the cosmological constant ) has geometric origin .",
    "finally , the lwrs models with @xmath217and @xmath188  do not present a sharp minimum , but rather an elongated trought shape in the parameter space , with the slope increasing with the value of @xmath6 and @xmath218 .",
    "this means that in this class of models a wide range of values for @xmath1 ( with a slight preference for negative values ) and corresponding values for @xmath204 are fitting to the supernova data .",
    "we must note that the reliability of these values is somehow deteriorated by the relatively small number of high-@xmath62 supernova and by the inherent difficulties in the calibration of the available data .",
    "an obvious source of error is that data from the gold2006 set is a combination of measurements taken on different instruments @xcite and in fact it has been already signaled that the gold2006 data set is not statistically homogeneous @xcite .",
    "the conclusion of this paper is somewhat similar to that of ref .",
    "@xcite : the presently available supernova data are not enough to discern among several cosmological models .",
    "however the difference between the predictions of the acceptable models of our analysis ( the @xmath9cdm model , the lwrs brane - world with @xmath5 and @xmath219and the models with weyl fluid and @xmath195 ) are increasing with @xmath62 .",
    "one may reasonably hope that the very far ( @xmath220 ) supernovae , which will be discovered for sure in the following decade , will improve their comparison .",
