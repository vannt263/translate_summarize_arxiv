    "the bcs to bec crossover in attractive fermion systems is a topic of enduring interest @xcite . with increasing interaction",
    ", the ground state of a weak coupling ` bcs superconductor ' @xcite , with pair size @xmath1 much larger than the interparticle separation @xmath2 , evolves smoothly @xcite into a ` bose - einstein condensate ' ( bec ) of preformed fermion pairs with @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 , above , is the fermi wavevector . the ` high temperature ' normal state changes from a conventional fermi liquid at weak coupling to a gapped phase at strong coupling .",
    "while the zero temperature pairing gap increases with coupling strength , the superconducting @xmath0 in lattice systems reaches a maximum at intermediate coupling and falls thereafter .",
    "a striking consequence of the separation of pairing and superconducting scales is the emergence of a ( pseudo)gapped normal phase , with preformed fermion pairs but no superconductivity due to strong phase fluctuations .    the early work of leggett @xcite and nozieres and schmitt - rink @xcite provided the intuitive basis for understanding this problem .",
    "it has since been followed up by powerful semi - analytic schemes @xcite , extensive quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) work @xcite , and most recently dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite .",
    "the efforts have established the non - monotonic @xmath0 , and the presence of a pseudogap in the single particle spectrum beyond moderate coupling and temperature @xmath5 .",
    "while the success of multiple methods in capturing the crossover is remarkable , most of them depend on translation invariance in the underlying problem .",
    "they do not naturally generalise to problems that involve the presence of disorder , or a confining potential , or the emergence of spontaneous modulation .",
    "these situations , for example , occur in the context of the disorder driven superconductor - insulator transition @xcite , trapped fermions in an optical lattice @xcite , and fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) states @xcite in population imbalanced systems .",
    "such problems , in general , require a real space approach .",
    "this paper presents such a real space implementation based on a static auxiliary field ( saf ) scheme .",
    "our main results are the following : ( i )  we demonstrate the ability of our approach to quantitatively capture the @xmath0 scale across the bcs - bec crossover , confirming its usefulness at all interaction strengths .",
    "( ii )  we quantify the crossover from an amplitude fluctuation dominated regime to a phase fluctuation dominated regime , through the ` high @xmath0 ' intermediate coupling window where both are important .",
    "( iii )  we present the thermal evolution of the single particle density of states with interaction and temperature , and , more importantly , the momentum resolved spectral function @xmath6 .",
    "we compare our results to qmc data wherever available .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we quickly compare the existing analytic and numerical methods used to study the bcs - bec crossover in lattice models .",
    "sec.iii presents our model and describes the method used in detail .",
    "sec.iv shows our results on thermodynamic indicators , the nature of fluctuations , density of states , and @xmath6 .",
    "sec.v discusses the limitations of our method and the scope for further work .",
    "since the bcs - bec crossover is a prototype of weak to strong coupling evolution , several methods , of increasing sophistication , have been brought to bear on it .",
    "these include mean field theory ( mft ) @xcite , mft corrected by gaussian fluctuations @xcite , the self consistent t - matrix approach ( sc - tma ) @xcite , a two particle self consistent ( 2psc ) scheme @xcite , the mapping to xy models @xcite , quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) @xcite , and recently dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite .",
    "there are detailed descriptions of these methods available in the original literature so we just provide a table that compares the strengths and limitations of these methods in the light of a few crucial indicators .",
    "these in our opinion include ( i )  thermodynamics : @xmath7 , ( ii )  single particle spectra , ( iii )  two particle properties , _ e.g _ , conductivity , and ( iv )  handling inhomogeneity , _",

    "@xmath11 is the chemical potential .",
    "we set @xmath12 and measure all other energies in terms of it .",
    "@xmath13 is the strength of onsite hubbard attraction .",
    "we will focus on the density @xmath14 which is close to half - filling but avoids the density wave features of @xmath15 .",
    "the model is known to have a superconducting ground state for all @xmath16 , while at @xmath15 there is the coexistence of superconducting and density wave ( dw ) correlations in the ground state .",
    "for @xmath17 the ground state evolves from a bcs state at @xmath18 to a bec of ` molecular pairs ' at @xmath19 .",
    "the pairing amplitude and gap at @xmath20 can be reasonably accessed within mean field theory or a simple variational wavefunction .",
    "mean field theory , however , assumes that the electrons are subject to a _ spatially uniform _ self - consistent pairing amplitude @xmath21 . at small @xmath22",
    "this vanishes when @xmath23 , but at large @xmath22 it vanishes only when @xmath24 .",
    "the actual @xmath0 at large @xmath25 is controlled by phase correlation of the local order parameter , rather than finite pairing amplitude , and occurs at @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a function of the density . the wide temperature window , between the ` pair formation ' scale @xmath28 and @xmath29 corresponds to equilibrium between unpaired fermions and hardcore bosons ( paired fermions ) .",
    "we use an auxiliary field scheme , based on the hubbard - stratonovich ( hs ) transformation , to retain the thermal amplitude and phase fluctuations explicitly .",
    "formally , the hs transformation ( below ) allows us to recast the original interacting problem into that of electrons coupled to space - time fluctuating auxiliary fields .",
    "usually the auxiliary fields are _ either _ the ` pairing fields ' @xmath30 _ or _ a ` density ' field @xmath31 .",
    "the pairing field based decomposition is employed in the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) approach , while qmc uses the density based decomposition .",
    "while these two representations lead to the same answer when the resulting problem is treated exactly , any approximation leads to answers that are decomposition dependent . `",
    "single channel ' decompositions @xcite , above , have the shortcoming that they _ do not _ reproduce the conserving hartree - fock - bdg ( hfbdg ) theory in their static limit , crucial when density inhomogeneities are present .    following recent suggestions @xcite we rewrite the a2dhm in terms of _ classical _ auxiliary fields in _ both _ pairing and density channels , see below , so that the saddle point reproduces hfbdg theory .",
    "@xmath32 we treat the @xmath33 as time independent , _",
    "i.e _ classical fields .",
    "the partition function is : @xmath34    as @xmath35 , it is obvious that @xmath36 will be dominated by the saddle point configuration , _ i.e _",
    ", @xmath37 , @xmath38 , that minimise @xmath39 .",
    "thus at @xmath20 : @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "these minimum conditions are easily recognised as the self - consistency requirements of hfbdg theory .",
    "minimising @xmath39 is thus the same as solving the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations . while this is good , we want to capture the thermal physics as well .",
    "at finite @xmath42 the bdg approach would promote the consistency condition above to thermal averages , and the electrons would see only the _ average _ background at any temperature .",
    "it is easy to see the limitation of this approach when we consider the clean problem at large @xmath25 .",
    "since the system is translation invariant , averages like @xmath43 are site independent . their self - consistent value , and hence superconductivity , vanishes when @xmath44 , way above the correct @xmath45 . to remedy this we need to _ average the electron motion over disordered thermal configurations _ rather than solve for electron motion in the disorder averaged configuration",
    "the boltzmann weight for the occurence of a particular @xmath46 configuration is @xmath47 this is related to the electron free energy in a particular @xmath46 background .",
    "if the fields are large and random the trace can not be analytically computed .",
    "we generate the equilibrium @xmath46 configurations by a monte carlo technique @xcite .",
    "this involves diagonalisation of the electron hamiltonian @xmath39 for every attempted update of the auxiliary fields and the metropolis condition for acceptance of this move .",
    "we use a cluster based implementation of the monte carlo @xcite and can access sizes upto @xmath48 .    the expectation value of any observable @xmath49 can then be computed as follows . for each configuration @xmath46 ,",

    "the @xmath75 case shows only a single broad peak at positive energy , whereas @xmath152 show a second peak at a smaller negative energy value .",
    "this two peak structure with a gap around @xmath140 is an indicator of pairing without global coherence . the complete absence at @xmath75 , and the increase in peak height from @xmath95 to @xmath103 bolsters this interpretation .",

    "to gain more perspective , we consider an expansion of the distribution about its mean value , @xmath183 , where the first term represents the gaussian stiffness of the distribution and the other terms represent non gaussian contributions . at strong coupling",

    "_ handling inhomogeneity : _ as remarked earlier , this method is particularly well suited to dealing with inhomogeneous systems , including disordered systems and systems in a trap .",
    "we have extensively studied both of these , the former in the context of the disorder induced superconductor - insulator transition @xcite , and the latter in the context of superconductors in a harmonic trap @xcite . in such inhomogeneous systems",
    ", the hartree feedback plays a crucial role in modifying the effective potential that the electronic system sees . in the former ,",
    "this is crucial in determining the correct critical disorder and moderate disorder charge transport properties @xcite , and plays a major role in the spatial fragmentation of the system @xcite . in a harmonic trap , the resultant inhomogeneous density profile can drastically alter the spectral properties of the system @xcite , compared to a flat one . similarly for fflo phases in imbalanced fermi systems the real space treatment on large lattices allow access to a wealth of non trivial modulated phases .",
    "_ quantum fluctuations : _ the major approximation in our model is the neglect of temporal fluctuations in the auxiliary fields .",
    "the primary effect is the absence of low energy ` bosonic ' modes ( due to preformed pairs ) at strong coupling .",

    "two particle correlations like conductivity also give accurate results as long as we are at moderate @xmath25 .",
    "however , as we increase @xmath22 the system develops a pseudo - gap ( or a gap ) above @xmath96 , and we get a resistivity with steadily increasing insulating character . in the complete treatment",
    "the bosonic modes allow a parallel channel of conduction .",
    "a purely static approximation misses this contribution at large @xmath22 , as does dmft .",
    "we have presented results on bcs - bec crossover in an attractive fermi system in the context of the two dimensional hubbard model .",
    "we use an auxiliary field decomposition , treat these fields as classical , and solve the resulting problem through a real space monte carlo technique .",
    "the inclusion of all spatial thermal fluctuations allows us to capture the correct @xmath0 all the way from the bcs to the bec end .",
    "it allows conceptual clarity about the amplitude and phase fluctuation dominated asymptotes and the crucial intermediate coupling window where both these fluctuations are relevant .",
    "we provide a detailed characterisation of the auxiliary field behaviour that dictates fermion physics and access results on the density of states and angle resolved spectral features without any need for analytic continuation .",
    "we lay the groundwork for the study of disordered superconductors , trapping effects in superfluids , and spontaneous inhomogeneity in imbalanced systems .",
