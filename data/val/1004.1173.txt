    "the normalization trend is easily understood : the integrated quasar emissivity determines the total mass density of the black hole population ( sotan 1982 ) , and assuming lower @xmath90 shifts this density to more massive , hence rarer , black holes , which must have a higher duty cycle to reproduce the luminosity function .",

    "we have checked that we can fit the @xmath83 data in figure  [ fig|blz ] using models with @xmath128 and decreasing scatter at high luminosity , e.g. , @xmath129 , 0.3 , 0.1 dex for the three bins of increasing luminosity , or even @xmath130 , 0.2 , 0.1 dex .",
    "however , the bias in the highest luminosity bin , which is rather uncertain at present , can significantly constrain such models .",
    "the duty cycles inferred from our analysis at @xmath131 are substantially lower than the values @xmath132 and @xmath133 inferred from the shen et al .",
    "( 2007 ) measurements of the clustering of quasars at @xmath134 and @xmath7 ( see shen et al .  2007 ; white et al .  2008 ; shankar et al .",
    "this decline in duty cycle at low redshifts is expected from continuity equation models : the bh mass function grows in time , but the observed quasar luminosity function declines at @xmath135 , so a lower duty cycle is required to reconcile them ( see , e.g. , figure 7 of swm ) .",
    "our current analysis does not constrain duty cycle evolution at @xmath136 , but strong evolution over this interval is predicted by the swm model and is consistent with the s09 correlation function data ( see figure  [ fig|wpyue ] ) .    the measurements in s09 provide significant constraints on the relation between quasar luminosity and halo mass , though leaving substantial degeneracy between the duty cycle and the scatter in this relation . reducing statistical errors and remaining systematic uncertainties , especially for the brightest luminosities ,",
    "would tighten these constraints ; in particular , an unambiguous and precise measurement of luminosity - dependent bias would place much tighter restrictions on scatter . the quasar catalog from sdss",
    "dr7 ( adelman - mccarthy et al .  2008 ) should yield noticeable improvements , with roughly 50% smaller error bars and fewer issues with internal boundaries in the survey region .",
    "since the sdss quasar sample has high completeness and ( with dr7 ) covers most of the high - latitude northern sky , it will be difficult to go much further with autocorrelation measurements in the s09 luminosity and redshift range .",
    "cross - correlation against denser samples of objects  fainter agn or bright galaxies  could yield higher precision clustering measurements , perhaps with photometric samples from surveys such as pan - starrs and lsst , but perhaps requiring spectroscopic samples like those envisioned for ambitious baryon acoustic oscillation experiments .",
    "the constraints on host halo populations can also be improved by extending clustering measurements to smaller scales , where quasar pairs from the same halo contribute , and to fainter luminosities , such as those probed by the 2df quasar redshift survey , the sdss photometric quasar catalog , and x - ray surveys ( e.g. , hennawi et al .",
    "2006 ; myers et al . 2007 ; plionis et al . 2008 , hennawi et al . 2009 )",
    "; for example , shen et al .",
    "( 2009b ) use small scale measurements to put constraints on the duty cycle of bhs in satellite galaxies .",
    "quasar clustering as a cosmological tool has moved from a prospect ( osmer 1981 ) to reality , and the growing precision and dynamic range of these measurements  in luminosity , redshift , and lengthscale  will teach us about the growth of supermassive black holes and the mechanisms that transform them from dormant monsters to brilliant beacons , and back .",
