    "the flow equations approach , pioneered by hoffman and turner @xcite and by kinney @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) , is a means of generating large numbers of inflation models via a random process , permitting for example that ensemble to be compared with observational results as done by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe team @xcite .",
    "it has however been pointed out by liddle @xcite that the flow equations algorithm is actually rather insensitive to the equations governing inflationary dynamics . in particular , the friedmann equation is not needed to determine the flow equation trajectories in the space of slow - roll parameters ; its only role is to measure the amount of expansion taking place along those trajectories .    in this",
    "_ brief report _",
    ", we make an explicit study of the effect of modifying the friedmann equation by considering the flow equations in the simplest braneworld inflation scenario , based on the randall  sundrum type ii model @xcite .",
    "the flow equations are a set of differential equations linking a set of slow - roll parameters defined from the hubble parameter @xmath0 . in the standard cosmology , following the notation of kinney @xcite , the parameters can be defined as @xmath1 where primes are derivatives with respect to the scalar field @xmath2 . using the relation @xmath3 where we define the number of @xmath4-foldings @xmath5 as _ decreasing _ with increasing time ,",
    "yields the flow equations @xmath6(^\\ell\\lambda_{{\\rm h}})+^{\\ell+1}\\!\\!\\ !      \\lambda_{{\\rm h } } \\ ; ; \\ ; \\ell \\ge2 \\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is a convenient definition .    as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , these equations actually have limited dynamical input from inflation , since the above derivation has been made without reference to the friedmann equation . indeed ,",
    "if written in the form @xmath8 they are a set of identities true for any function @xmath9 , and the reparametrization to @xmath10 modifies only the measure along the trajectories , not the trajectories themselves . in that light",
    "it seems surprising that they can say much about inflation at all , but it turns out that the flow equations can be viewed as a ( rather complicated ) algorithm for generating functions @xmath11 which have a suitable form to be interpreted as inflationary models @xcite .",
    "@xcite implied that the flow equation predictions ought to be little changed by moving to the braneworld , although this modifies the friedmann equation .",
    "however this statement needs explicit justification , because although the trajectories are unaffected , there are several changes which affect the predictions : the measure of @xmath4-foldings along the trajectories changes , the endpoints of the trajectories change , and the equations relating the slow - roll parameters to the observables change . in this short article",
    "we investigate these effects , restricting ourselves to the high - energy regime of the randall  sundrum type ii model @xcite .",
    "we follow the notation of ref .  @xcite . in the randall  sundrum type ii braneworld model @xcite , the friedmann equation in the high - energy regime",
    "can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the five - dimensional planck mass , related to the brane tension @xmath14 by @xmath15 .",
    "the scalar wave equation is unchanged , and a useful expression is @xmath16    although they could be used , the standard cosmology definitions of the slow - roll parameters , eqs .",
    "( [ e : eps ] ) and ( [ e : srdef ] ) , are actually not very convenient in the braneworld scenario , in particular because @xmath17 is no longer the condition to end inflation . instead , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we define new slow - roll parameters relevant to the high - energy regime as follows : @xmath18 by analogy to the standard cosmology case , we define the higher - order slow - roll parameters as @xmath19 where one can identify @xmath20 .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) , the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath5 , measuring the length along the trajectories , is changed to @xmath21 from these definitions , and taking the convention we find a set of flow equations @xmath22\\,;\\\\ \\frac{d(^{\\ell}\\lambda_{\\rm h})}{d\\phi } & = & \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{\\rm h } } \\frac{h'}{h}\\left\\ { \\left[(\\ell-1)\\eta_{\\rm h}-(\\ell+1)\\epsilon_{\\rm h}\\right](^{\\ell}\\lambda_{\\rm h } ) \\right . \\quad",

    "+ ^{(\\ell+1)}\\lambda_{\\rm h}\\right\\}\\ , ; \\quad \\ell\\ge 2 \\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which leads to the following set of flow equations for the braneworld @xmath23(^{\\ell}\\lambda_{\\rm h } ) \\\\ & & \\quad \\quad + ^{(\\ell+1)}\\lambda_{\\rm h } ; \\,\\ , \\ell\\ge 2 \\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 .",
    "note that the braneworld slow - roll parameters were purposefully defined @xcite so that the end of inflation is at @xmath25 , and so that standard expression for the spectral index @xmath26 still applies ; however the expression for the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath27 is modified from the usual @xmath28 . in common use ,",
    "the other one being 16 times this one .",
    "we use this convention to follow kinney @xcite . ] the observable quantities at first - order are given by @xcite @xmath29    following ref .",
    "@xcite , we can analyze the fixed points where all the derivatives vanish , for which the conditions are @xmath30 as in the standard cosmology , these correspond to @xmath31 and are stable for @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath33 branch is stable for integration backwards in time .",
    "we solve the flow equations following the method of kinney @xcite , both for the standard cosmology where we verify his results and for the system of braneworld flow equations written above .",
    "we consider 60,000 initial conditions drawn from the ranges kinney uses ( taking the same ranges also for the braneworld slow - roll parameters ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig ] , with observables computed to first - order in slow - roll .        for both models ,",
    "the majority of the points lie effectively on the @xmath34 axis , and in addition we see in each case the now - familiar swathe of points following a tight diagonal locus to large values of @xmath27 and @xmath35 @xcite , plus some other scattered points .",
    "the two distributions are extremely similar , though the swathe for the braneworld is slightly below that of the standard cosmology .",
    "we conclude therefore that the change in the dynamical equations does not significantly affect the distribution of points in the space of observables .",
    "we have modified the flow equations approach to implement it in the high - energy regime of the randall  sundrum type ii braneworld cosmology .",
    "although the flow equation trajectories are independent of the dynamical equation driving inflation , changes do occur because the measure of length ( i.e.  the number of @xmath4-foldings ) along the trajectories changes , because the point corresponding to the end of inflation changes , and because the formulae giving the observables change . nevertheless , we have shown that those effects are small and that the distribution of observables predicted by the braneworld flow equations is very similar to that of the standard cosmology .",
