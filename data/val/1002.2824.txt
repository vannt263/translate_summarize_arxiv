    "development of accurate efficient methods for the electronic structure of molecules , solids , clusters has been a topic of increasingly intense interest in chemistry , physics , materials science , etc . in the past two decades ,",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) has been applied with remarkable success to investigate the structural ( such as geometries , vibrational frequencies , energetics of chemical reactions , etc . ) as well as dynamical ( such as photoabsorption , photoemission , multi - photon ionization , high - order harmonic generation , etc . )",
    "characteristics of such systems .",
    "in essence , the ground - state electronic energy is partitioned as : @xmath0 = t_s[\\rho({\\mathrm { \\mathbf { r } } } ) ] + u[\\rho({\\mathrm { \\mathbf { r } } } ) ] + e_{xc}[\\rho({\\mathrm { \\mathbf { r}}})]$ ] , where the three terms in the right - hand side denote kinetic energy of a system of non - interacting particles of same density @xmath1 , classical electrostatic energy ( including electron - nuclear attraction , electron - electron and nuclear - nuclear repulsion ) , and exchange - correlation ( xc ) energy respectively .",
    "the single - particle wave functions are obtained from the kohn - sham ( ks ) equation as : @xmath2 \\psi_i({\\mathrm { \\mathbf { r } } } ) = \\epsilon_i \\psi_i ( { \\mathrm { \\mathbf { r}}})\\ ] ] where @xmath3 contains the relevant one- and two - body potentials , while the electron density is given by the squared sum of the occupied orbitals , @xmath4 .    broadly speaking ,",
    "two approaches have gained popularity for the practical solution of above ks equation . in the _ real - space method _",
    "@xcite the discretized ks equation is solved iteratively on a mesh using either finite - difference , finite - element or wavelets .",
    "the grid - based matrix presentation produces _ structured , highly banded",
    "_ matrices .",
    "moreover , the near _ locality _ ( the potential operator is diagonal in coordinate space whereas the laplacian operator is nearly local ) can potentially remove the omnipresent nagging problem arising due to the basis - set incompleteness in the contrasting basis - set approaches .",
    "furthermore , they are easily amenable to the so - called linear - scaling methods . while such schemes usually require a larger number of grids to achieve physically meaningful results , through introduction of higher - order and multigrid techniques , the effective grid can be reduced significantly . in _",
    "basis - set _ approaches , on the other hand , the single - particle wave functions are represented by a variety of functions such as slater - type orbitals , gaussian type functions ( gtf ) , numerical functions , plane waves ( pw ) , augmented plane waves , linear muffin - tin orbitals etc . while currently , there is a preponderance of the atom - centered localized gtfs in the field of molecular quantum chemistry @xcite ( chiefly due their ability to deal with some of the important multi - center integrals analytically ) , _ ab initio _ calculation in the condensed matter regime is almost exclusively dominated by the pws @xcite ( mainly because the fast - fourier transform ( fft ) technique can be employed to take advantage of the periodicity of such systems ) .",
    "this work is concerned with the basis - set approach to tackle the electron - structure calculation of atoms and molecules .",
    "recently there has been effort to combine the basis sets ; e.g. , in @xcite , a gaussian basis set was used to expand the ks molecular orbital ( mo ) , whereas an _ auxiliary _ augmented pw basis was utilized to express the electronic charge density .    excepting a very few attempts such as the _ grid - free _",
    "approach @xcite , that uses a resolution of identity to evaluate multi - center integrals over functionals at the expense of an _ auxiliary _ basis set , a large majority of basis - set - based molecular dft calculations employ some carefully selected suitable 3d quadrature for a sensible choice of grid points in space .",
    "a very successful common scheme @xcite involves partitioning the 3d molecular integrand into single - center discrete atomic  cells \" .",
    "these can be treated using standard numerical techniques individually and then summing these up using some appropriate weight functions leads to the desired final result .",
    "in this so - called atom - centered grid ( acg ) method , the mono - centric atomic integrals are computed by separating the radial and angular components .",
    "the former has typically been performed by introducing several quadratures and various mapping schemes . some of these are gauss - chebyshev quadrature of second kind , chebyshev quadratures of first and second kind , gaussian quadrature , euler - maclaurin formula , numerical quadratures , etc . @xcite .",
    "angular integrations are handled usually by the lebedev spherical method @xcite . in another development , @xcite 3d integration of molecular integrands",
    "were performed numerically based on a division of space and subsequent integration over the resulting regions by product gauss rule . a variational integration mesh @xcite , which depends on the position of individual atoms",
    "has also been reported by breaking the space into three different regions , _ viz .",
    ", _ atomic spheres , excluded cubic region and interstitial parallelepiped .",
    "other numerical grids @xcite have been proposed as well for gaussian basis set calculations .",
    "recently there has been an attempt to connect the cartesian coordinate grid ( ccg ) and acg by a divided - difference polynomial interpolation which can translate the electron density and gradients from the former to the latter @xcite .    in a previous article @xcite , henceforth referred to as i , efforts were made to employ the ccgs in the context of atoms and molecules within the linear combination of gtf ansatz of dft . in this work ,",
    "respective quantities such as the localized atom - centered basis set , the two - body classical coulomb repulsion and the non - classical xc potentials were directly set up on the 3d ccg .",
    "local - density approximated ( lda ) xc functionals of the homogeneous electron gas in conjunction with the hay - wadt type pseudopotential was used .",
    "a multitude of quantities like _ viz .",
    ", _ individual energy contributions to total energy , eigenvalues , potential energy curves , ionization energies , as well as atomization energies were investigated . the relevance and performance of the ccgs",
    "were judged on 12 molecules ( from small to medium size ) and 3 atoms . in each of these cases practically identical results as those from the",
    "acg and grid - free results were obtained .",
    "now , it is well - known that the local density functionals suffer from a number of problems and hence it is essential to use more accurate functionals , namely those incorporating the gradient and laplacian corrections .",
    "we have a number of objectives in this article .",
    "firstly , we want to assess the validity and efficacy of the aforementioned scheme of i for a larger set of species to justify and validate its future usage .",
    "secondly its scope of applicability is broadened by incorporating the gradient corrected xc functionals ( for demonstration , the popular non - local becke exchange @xcite and lee - yang - parr ( lyp ) correlation @xcite is used ) .",
    "first , a detailed test on the convergence of our results on 5 atoms and 12 molecules is made as in i for the blyp xc functional . in the next step ,",
    "additional 41 molecules are considered both at the lda and blyp level .",
    "detailed comparison with reference theoretical and experimental results are made , wherever possible .",
    "besides , we also report the highest - occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) energies obtained with the leeuwen - baerends ( lb ) @xcite exchange potential for the latter 41 molecules ( see section iii for motivational details ) . in all cases ,",
    "this significantly improves both lda and blyp homo energies .",
    "section ii gives a summary of the method of calculation and computational aspects .",
    "section iii presents a discussion on the results obtained .",
    "we end with a few concluding remarks about the future prospects in section iv .",
    "this section sketches the essential steps involved in the ground - state calculation of a many - electron system within the ks dft framework used in the present work ; further details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the ks mos @xmath5 are linearly expanded in terms of a set of k known basis functions as , @xmath6 where the set @xmath7 denotes the contracted gaussian functions centered on the constituent atoms while @xmath8 contains the contraction coefficients for the orbital @xmath9 .",
    "the individual spin - densities are given by , @xmath10 where @xmath11 stands for the respective density matrices .",
    "substitution of these terms into the energy expression , followed by minimization with respect to unknown coefficients @xmath12 , subject to the orthogonality constraint leads to the following matrix ks equation which is akin to the unrestricted pople - nesbet equation in hartree - fock ( hf ) theory , @xmath13 here @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the @xmath16 real , square symmetric overlap and total ks matrices respectively .",
    "@xmath17 stands for the eigenvector matrix containing the expansion coefficients @xmath12 while the orbital energies @xmath18 are embedded in the diagonal matrix @xmath19 .",
    "the ks matrix is conveniently written as , @xmath20 where the first two terms in the right - hand side signify the matrices of one - electron bare - nucleus hamiltonian and the classical coulomb repulsion .",
    "the one - electron overlap , kinetic - energy and nuclear - attraction integrals involved are the same as encountered in the gtf - based hf schemes and are computed using standard recursion algorithm @xcite . the pseudopotential matrix elements in the gaussian basis are taken taken from the gamess quantum chemistry program output @xcite .",
    "the coulomb potential is evaluated using a fourier convolution technique @xcite , which effectively uses a ewald summation type decomposition in terms of short- and long - range contributions , @xmath21 here erf(x ) and erfc(x ) identify the error function and complimentary error function respectively .",
    "note that the latter goes to zero exponentially fast at large @xmath22 .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 controls the range on which @xmath24 is nonzero . after a thorough check on the convergence with respect to @xmath23",
    ", a value within the range of 68 seemed satisfactory and we employed 7 for all the results reported in this work .",
    "this has produced highly satisfying results for a modest number of atomic ( 3 ) and molecular ( 12 ) systems in our previous work @xcite .",
    "the short - range fourier integral is calculated analytically , whereas the long - range part is obtained from fft of the real - space values .",
    "as already mentioned , a major thrust of the current communication is to demonstrate the feasibility and viability of our current scheme in the context of so - called `` non - local '' ( gradient and laplacian - dependent ) xc functionals which would be necessary for future chemical applications . for this",
    ", we first test this with two of the widely used functionals , namely the becke exchange @xcite and lyp correlation @xcite ( for convenience , an alternative equivalent form @xcite containing only the first derivative has been mostly used in practice ) .",
    "the homogeneous electron - gas correlation of vosko - wilk - nusair ( vwn ) @xcite is used in all the lda calculations .",
    "following @xcite , the gradient - dependent functionals can be treated without evaluating the density hessians by using a finite - orbital basis expansion . to this end , xc contributions of the ks matrix",
    "is written in the following working form , @xmath25 d{\\mathrm { \\mathbf { r}}}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and their gradients .",
    "the blyp functionals are implemented using the density functional repository program @xcite .",
    "the two - electron matrix elements can not be evaluated analytically ; here we use direct numerical integrations on the ccg grid .",
    "note that some of the existing dft codes @xcite use an alternative route of fitting these by an auxiliary basis set , the so - called discrete variational method @xcite .",
    "the generalized matrix - eigenvalue problem is solved using the standard lapack routine @xcite accurately efficiently .",
    "self - consistent set of mos , density and energy are obtained in the usual manner subject to the convergence of ( a ) potential ( b ) total energy and ( c ) eigenvalues .",
    "tolerance of @xmath30 a.u . was used for ( b ) and ( c ) , while a value of @xmath31 for ( a ) .",
    "atomic units employed , unless otherwise mentioned .",
    "at first , table i shows a comparison of our calculated ground - state energy components with respect to the number of mesh points @xmath32 as well as the grid spacing @xmath33 , for cl@xmath34 and hcl at internuclear distances 4.2 and 2.4 a.u respectively employing the blyp density functional . in this occasion , we adopt a similar presentation strategy as in i. a series of calculations were performed in the same fashion to test the convergence of our results with respect to the grid parameters .",
    "these numerical experiments produced very similar conclusions as reached in for lda xc - case in i. hence out of eight , we eventually report here the results from two such sets only ( to avoid too many entries in the table ) , _ viz . , _",
    "( i ) set a with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , ( ii ) set b with @xmath37 , @xmath38 , which suffices to illustrate the important points .",
    "the reference theoretical results presented in this and all other tables throughout the article imply those obtained from the gamess quantum chemistry program @xcite . they use same basis set ,",
    "effective core potential and employing the  grid \" option .",
    "the corresponding results from the  gridfree \" option are quoted in footnotes for convenience , in several occasions .",
    "now onwards , we will refer to them as _ grid _ and _ grid - free _ theoretical reference results .",
    "the former uses the euler - mclaurin quadrature for the radial integrations and gauss - legendre quadrature for the angular integrations .",
    "the convergence of energies and other quantities with respect to the radial and angular grid was monitored by performing two extra set of calculations ( i ) @xmath39 = 96 , 36 , 72 ( ii ) @xmath39 = 128 , 36 , 72 , besides the default grid option ( @xmath39 = 96 , 12 , 24 ) , where the three integers denote the respective number of integration points in @xmath40 directions .",
    "note that all the 3 grids offered very similar results ; for example , out of the 17 atoms and molecules , total energies remain same upto 5th decimal place for 8 species for all 3 grids . in the remaining cases , they differed slightly among each other as the grid parameters changed ; the largest deviation in total energy being 0.00064 a.u . for na@xmath34cl@xmath34 and for all others",
    "it is well below 0.00007 a.u .",
    "however , passing from the default grid to ( ii ) gradually improves @xmath41 . in this and all other tables in the article ,",
    "we have quoted ( ii ) results for the reference _ grid_-dft values .",
    "the _ grid - free _ implementation uses the resolution of identity to simplify the molecular integrals enabling their analytical evaluation and obviating the necessity of using grid quadratures .",
    "quantities considered are the same as those in i , _ viz . , _ various energies such as kinetic ( @xmath42 ) , total nucleus - electron attraction ( @xmath43 ) , classical coulomb repulsion ( @xmath44 ) , exchange ( @xmath45 ) , correlation ( @xmath46 ) , total two - electron potential ( @xmath47 ) , nuclear repulsion ( @xmath48 ) , total potential ( @xmath49 ) , electronic ( @xmath50 ) and total energy ( @xmath51 ) respectively , as well as the integrated electron density @xmath41 .",
    "evidently , as in the lda case , both sets offer excellent agreement in total energies and component energies with literature values for both molecules .",
    "the individual two - body energy terms were not available in the reference output and thus could not be directly compared .",
    "as expected , for obvious reasons set b results are closer to reference values than set a , but only marginally . for cl@xmath34 this is slightly more pronounced than that for hcl .",
    "absolute deviations in total energy for set b for cl@xmath34 and hcl are only 0.00002 and 0.00000 a.u . respectively . in both cases",
    ", there is slight improvement in @xmath41 , as we move from set a to b. for all practical purposes , set a is adequate enough for both of them .",
    "note that reference _ grid - free _ dft energies differ substantially from the corresponding _",
    "grid_-dft values .",

    "<S> this is a follow - up of our recently proposed work on pseudopotential calculation ( ref . </S>",
    "<S> [ 21 ] ) of atoms and molecules within dft framework , using cartesian coordinate grid . </S>",
    "<S> detailed results are presented to demonstrate the usefulness , applicability of the same for a larger set of species ( 5 atoms ; 53 molecules ) and exchange - correlation functionals ( local , nonlocal ) . a thorough comparison on total , component , ionization , atomization energies , eigenvalues , potential energy curves with available literature data shows excellent agreement . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , homo energies for a series of molecules show significant improvements by using the leeuwen - baerends exchange potential , compared to other functionals considered . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with experiments has been made , wherever possible . </S>"
