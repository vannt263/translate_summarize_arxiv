    "since its discovery , d - brane has been one of the central objects of interest in string theory .",
    "it represents fundamental nonperturbative features and is an analog of the soliton excitation in string theory .    in conformal field theory ,",
    "the d - brane is described by boundary state .",
    "it belongs to the _ closed _ string hilbert space and is implemented by the boundary conditions such as , @xmath1 up to normalization constant .",
    "the information of the open strings which live on d - brane can be extracted from @xmath2 after modular transformation , @xmath3    for more generic ( conformal invariant ) background where we can not use the free field oscillators as above , the boundary condition can be implemented only through generators of virasoro algebra , @xmath4 this condition is _ universal _ in a sense that it does not depend on a particular representation of virasoro algebra which corresponds to the background .",
    "this linear equation , however , is not enough to characterize the d - brane completely .",
    "we need further constraints that the open string sectors derived from them should be well - defined . more explicitly , take two states @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) which satisfy eq .",
    "( [ e_boundary ] ) .",
    "the open string sector appears in the annulus amplitude after the modular transformation can be written as , @xmath7 where @xmath8 are characters of the irreducible representations in the open string channel . in order to have well - defined open string sector , the coefficients @xmath9 must be non - negative integers .",
    "this is called _ cardy condition _",
    "we note that these are non - linear ( quadratic ) constraints in terms of the boundary states .",
    "these conditions ( [ e_boundary ] , [ e_cardy ] ) are written in terms of the boundary conformal field theory . in this sense , it is at the level of the first quantization . in order to consider the off - shell process , such as tachyon condensation , we need to use the second quantized description .",
    "one of the strong candidates of the off - shell descriptions of string theory is string field theory .",
    "therefore , it is natural to ask whether one may derive conditions which are equivalent to ( [ e_boundary ] , [ e_cardy ] ) in that language .",
    "there are a few species of string field theories .",
    "the best - established one is witten s open bosonic string field theory @xcite . in terms of this formulation ,",
    "the annihilation process of unstable d - branes was first studied extensively and it established the idea of `` tachyon vacuum '' by computation of the d - brane tension numerically @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", however , we do not use this formulation since the dynamical variables of open string field theory depend essentially on the d - brane where the open string is attached . since our goal is to find the characterization of generic consistent boundaries , this variable is not particularly natural because of this particular reference to the specific d - brane .",
    "since the boundary state belongs to the closed string hilbert space , we will instead take the closed string field theory as the basic language .",
    "with closed string variable , the description of the linear constraint ( [ e_boundary ] ) is trivial : @xmath10 . on the other hand ,",
    "the description of the cardy condition ( [ e_cardy ] ) is much more nontrivial since it is the requirement to the _ open _ string channel which appears only after the modular transformation .",
    "furthermore , it is a nonlinear relation .",
    "if it is possible to represent it in string field theory , one needs to use the closed string star product to express nonlinear relations .",
    "there are two types of closed string star products which have been studied in the literature .",
    "the first one is zwiebach s star product which is a closed string version of witten s open string star product @xcite and the other one is a covariant version of the light - cone string field theory ( hikko s vertex ) @xcite .",
    "they are defined through the overlap of three strings as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ovelapping ] .",
    "[ 0.5 ]    these vertices are constructed to define the closed string field theories proposed by these authors . in this paper , however , our main focus is the algebraic structure between boundary states .",
    "indeed , the nonlinear relation which we are going to study holds for both of these two vertices . in a sense",
    ", our relation does not seem to be a consequence of their proposed action at least at this moment but rather comes directly from the basic properties of the boundary conformal field theory .",
    "the nonlinear equation has been proposed and studied in our previous papers @xcite .",
    "it can be written as an idempotency relation algebra .",
    "it reminds us of the fact that the topological charge carried by the d - brane is given by the k - theory @xcite . in the context of the noncommutative geometry , an element which represents a k - theory class",
    "is given by the projection equation @xcite , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the product of the ( noncommutative ) background geometry .",
    "solutions of this equation are called noncommutative soliton @xcite . later ,",
    "even in the bosonic string which does not have rr charge , it was argued @xcite that the noncommutative solitons still represent unstable d - branes .",
    "topological charges of d - branes are represented in terms of the projector @xmath13 .",
    "for instance , the d - brane number is related to the rank of @xmath13 .",
    "] among boundary states , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the tension of the d - brane associated with the boundary state @xmath2 . in the first paper @xcite",
    ", we proved it for the usual d@xmath16-brane boundary states for @xmath17 and hikko vertex for @xmath12 .",
    "a surprise was that this equation is universal for any boundary states which we considered including the coefficient @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the proof is based on an explicit calculation with the oscillator representation @xcite . in the second paper @xcite",
    ", we gave an outline of the proof of the same equation for zwiebach s vertex .",
    "the equation takes the same form for these two vertices except for the overall constant @xmath18 . from these observations , we conjectured that eq .",
    "( [ e_idempotency ] ) is a background independent characterization of the boundary state .    toward that direction , in @xcite",
    ", we used the path integral definition of the string field theory in terms of the conformal mapping @xcite and tried to prove the relation in the general background .",
    "after some efforts , we have arrived at a weaker statement : suppose @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) satisfy the linear constraint ( [ e_boundary ] ) , the state @xmath19 also satisfies the same constraint .",
    "it proves that product of any boundary state in weak sense becomes again boundary state in weak sense .",
    "this does not , of course , imply the cardy constraint ( [ e_cardy ] ) and , in particular , we could not understand the role of the open string sector .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to discuss the link with open string which was missed in our previous studies and establish more explicit relation between ( [ e_idempotency ] ) and the cardy condition .",
    "a crucial hint to this problem is that the coefficient @xmath18 in the relation ( [ e_idempotency ] ) is actually divergent and it is necessary to introduce some sort of regularization in the computation . in @xcite , we cut - off the rank of neumann coefficient by @xmath20 .",
    "then the divergent coefficient behaves as @xmath21 . in lpp approach , on the other hand , another type of the regularization can be introduced by slightly shifting the interaction point on the world sheet .",
    "such a shift gives a small strip which interpolates between two holes associated with the boundary . in the limit of turning - off the regulator , the moduli parameter which describes the shape of the strip becomes zero",
    "this is the usual factorization process where the world sheet becomes degenerate @xcite .",
    "an essential point is that such a factorization process occurs in the _ open string channel _ between the two holes . in this way ,",
    "the equation for the string field ( [ e_idempotency ] ) can be related with the consistency of the dual open string channel .",
    "the leading singularity comes from the propagation of the open string tachyon which is universal for any boundary states in arbitrary background and it explains our claim that the divergent factor @xmath18 is also universal for any cardy states",
    ".    this outline will be explained in detail in section 2 .",
    "we will also repeat our previous discussion @xcite that only the boundary states can satisfy the equation ( [ e_boundary ] ) . by combining these ideas",
    ", it will be obvious that the nonlinear equation ( [ e_boundary ] ) plays an essential rle to understand d - branes in the context of string field theory .    at this point",
    ", it may be worth while to mention that our claims are remarkably similar to the scenario conjectured in vacuum string field theory @xcite .",
    "the form of the equation is exactly the same except that the dynamical variables and the star product are totally different .",
    "there is no nontrivial solution in the vicinity of @xmath22 and the non - vanishing solutions correspond to d - branes . in a sense",
    ", our equation is an explicit realization of vsft scenario in the dual closed string channel . while the dynamical variables is closed string field , the physical excitations around the boundary state are on - shell open string mode @xcite .",
    "our discussion in section 2 is based on the path integral and the argument becomes necessarily formal to some extent . in this sense , it is desirable to check the consistency of the argument in the oscillator representation for some non - trivial backgrounds .",
    "fortunately , there are explicit forms of the three string vertex for ( 1 ) toroidal @xmath23 and ( 2 ) orbifold @xmath24 compactification @xcite .",
    "in both cases , the three string vertex has some modifications compared to that on the flat background @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "one needs to include cocycle factor due to the existence of winding mode and take into account the twisted sector in orbifold case .",
    "the cocycle factor is needed to keep jacobi identity for the @xmath12 product of the closed string field theory . in section 3",
    ", we perform explicit computation of @xmath12 product among the boundary ( ishibashi ) states . for torus case",
    ", there appear extra cocycle factors in the algebra of ishibashi states and some care is needed to construct cardy states as idempotents of the algebra . for the orbifold case , mixing between untwisted",
    "sector and twisted sector is needed to describe the fractional d - branes .",
    "the ratio of the coefficients of the two sectors is given as the ratio of the determinants of the neumann matrices for the ( un)twisted sectors .",
    "we use various regularization methods to calculate them explicitly .",
    "this result is consistent with our previous arguments @xcite .    finally , the third issue which will be discussed in section 4 is to incorpolate the noncommutativity on the d - brane .",
    "we have already seen in @xcite that non - commutativity on the world volume of the d - brane forces us to use the open string metric to write down the on - shell conditions .",
    "this is possible since the explicit form of the boundary state is known for such cases . on the other hand , for the noncommutativity in the transverse directions , it is difficult to express in the language of the boundary conformal field theory",
    ". this is , however , an important set - up for matrix models or noncommutative yang - mills theory .",
    "a motivation toward this direction is our previous study @xcite where we have seen that an analog of the noncommutative soliton arises in the commutative limit .",
    "we note that the idempotency relation for the d@xmath16-brane takes the following form in the matter sector , @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the coordinates in the transverse directions . in order to recover the universal relation ( [ e_idempotency ] ) , we need to take a linear combination , @xmath28 eq .",
    "( [ e_idempotency ] ) then implies @xmath29 which is the same as ( [ e_projector ] ) in the commutative limit .",
    "it is , therefore , tempting to study what kind of modification will be necessary in the presence of @xmath0 field .    in order to study it",
    ", we consider a particular deformation of ishibashi states which seems to be relevant to describe the noncommutativity along the transverse directions .",
    "we take the star product between them and take seiberg - witten limit .",
    "the constraint for @xmath30 is deformed to the following form , @xmath31 this @xmath32 product is commutative but breaks associativity .",
    "it appeared in mathematical literature @xcite and is related to the loop corrections in noncommutative super yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "the appearance of such deformation seems to be natural since the star product of two boundaries is topologically equivalent to one loop from the open string viewpoint .",
    "in this section , we prove the relation ( [ e_idempotency ] ) in the generic background by using a sequence of conformal maps .",
    "our proof depends only on a generic property of the boundary conformal field theory  factorization  which should be satisfied axiomatically in any bcft .",
    "our discussion also shows a clear link between the cardy condition and the idempotency relation .      the factorization is a general behavior of the correlation functions of the conformal field theory defined on a pinched riemann surface .",
    "the relevant process for us is the degeneration of a strip between two holes where the correlation function behaves as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the label of orthonormal basis @xmath35 of the open string hilbert space between two holes and @xmath36 is the conformal dimension of @xmath37 .",
    "the open string channel depends on the boundary conditions at two holes .",
    "@xmath38 is a real parameter which describes the degeneration of the strip and @xmath39 are the coordinates of the two points along the boundary where the two ends of the strip are attached ( fig .",
    "[ fig : degenerate ] ) .",
    "[ 0.55 ]    in the star product , such a degeneration of a strip appears as we explained in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "it comes from combining the geometrical nature of the boundary state as a surface state and three string vertex . in order to explain the former",
    ", we consider an inner product between a closed string state @xmath40 and a boundary state : @xmath41 . on the world - sheet ,",
    "it is equivalent to the one - point function on a disk @xmath42 with the boundary condition at @xmath43 specified by the boundary state .",
    "if we map from the sphere to a cylinder by a conformal transformation , @xmath44 , the geometrical role of the boundary state can be summarized as follows : ( fig .",
    "[ fig : boundary ] )    [ 0.5 ]    1 .   cut the infinite cylinder at @xmath45 and strip off the region @xmath46 , 2 .",
    "set the boundary condition specified by @xmath2 at the boundary .",
    "we combine this property of the boundary state with that of the three string vertex , which is represented by mandelstam diagram ( fig .  [",
    "fig : vertex]-a ) for hikko type vertex .",
    "[ 0.9 ]    the matrix element @xmath47 corresponds to putting three local operators @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) at the ends of three half cylinders .",
    "as we see previously , the boundary states are not described by local operators but should be interpreted as the surface state . to take the product of two boundary states",
    "@xmath50 is then geometrically represented as the mandelstam diagram whose two legs are stripped at the interaction time @xmath45 ( see a fig .",
    "[ fig : vertex]-b ) .",
    "this configuration is , however , singular since two boundaries are attached at one point ( interaction point ) and we need a regularization to obtain a smooth surface .",
    "a natural regularization is to shift the location of the boundary slightly , for example at @xmath51 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vertex]-c ) . as we see later ,",
    "this is equivalent to a cut - off of the neumann matrix with finite size @xmath20 which was used in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "the correspondence of the regulator turns out to be @xmath52 . with this regularization ,",
    "the world - sheet becomes a cylinder with one vertex operator insertion .",
    "the limit @xmath53 is equivalent to shrinking a strip of this diagram and reducing it to a disk .",
    "we can use the discussion of factorization as , @xmath54 where again @xmath55 belongs to a set of orthonormal operators in the _ open _ string hilbert space with both end attached to a brane specified by @xmath2 and @xmath56 are the coordinates along the boundary .    for the consistency of boundary states of the bosonic string ,",
    "the lowest dimensional operator in the hilbert space is always tachyon state which is written as , @xmath57 where @xmath58 are @xmath59 invariant vacuum for the matter and ghost .",
    "the conformal dimension of this state is @xmath60 .",
    "other terms depend on the detail of the boundary state but they always give less singular terms as @xmath61 . similarly ,",
    "if we @xmath12-multiply two different boundary states @xmath62 , the open string sector is described by the hilbert space of the _ mixed _ boundary condition and the lowest dimensional operator always has a dimension @xmath63 greater than @xmath64 .",
    "this simple argument then implies , @xmath65 although the less singular terms do depend on the background and boundary state , the first term is universal .",
    "as we see , the precise structure for ghost and singularity is more involved due to the ghost insertions in the three string vertex and the singular behaviour themselves should be modified in order to obtain the precise agreement with the oscillator computation .      in order to see the degeneration in detail",
