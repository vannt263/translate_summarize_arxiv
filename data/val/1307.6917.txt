    "in the book @xcite wavelet expansions of non - random functions bounded on @xmath1 were studied in different spaces",
    ". however , developed deterministic methods may not be appropriate to investigate wavelet expansions of stochastic processes .",
    "for example , in the majority of cases , which are interesting from theoretical and practical application points of view , stochastic processes have almost surely unbounded sample paths on @xmath2 it indicates the necessity of elaborating special stochastic techniques .",
    "recently , a considerable attention was given to the properties of the wavelet orthonormal series representation of random processes .",
    "more information on convergence of wavelet expansions of random processes in various spaces , references and numerous applications can be found in @xcite .",
    "most known stochastic results concern the mean - square or almost sure convergence , but for various practical applications one needs to require uniform convergence . to give an adequate description of the performance of wavelet approximations in both cases , for points where the processes are relatively smooth and points where spikes occur , we can use the uniform distance instead of global integral @xmath3 metrics .",
    "a more in depth discussion , further references and various applications in econometrics , simulations of stochastic processes and functional data analysis can be found in @xcite . in his 2010 szekeres medal inauguration speech , an eminent leader in the field , prof .",
    "p. hall stated the development of uniform stochastic approximation methods as one of frontiers in modern functional data analysis .",
    "figures  1 and 2 illustrate some features of wavelet expansions of stochastic processes .",
    "figure  1 presents a simulated realization of the wiener process and its wavelet reconstructions by two sums with different numbers of terms .",
    "the figure has been generated by the r package wmtsa @xcite . besides providing a realization of the wiener process and its wavelet reconstructions",
    ", we also plot corresponding reconstruction errors .",
    "figure  2 shows maximum absolute reconstruction errors for 100 simulated realizations . to reconstruct each realization of the wiener process two approximation sums ( as in figure  1 ) were used .",
    "we clearly see that empirical probabilities of obtaining large reconstruction errors become smaller if the number of terms in the wavelet expansions increases .",
    "although this effect is expected , it has to be established theoretically in a stringent way for different classes of stochastic processes and wavelet bases .",
    "it is also important to obtain theoretical estimations of the rate of convergence for such stochastic wavelet expansions .",
    "+ * fig.1 *  plots of the wiener process and its wavelet reconstructions     + * fig.2 *  plots of reconstruction errors for 100 simulated realizations    in this paper we make an attempt to derive general results on stochastic uniform convergence which are valid for wavelet expansions of wide classes of stochastic processes . the paper deals with the most general class of such wavelet expansions in comparison with particular cases considered by different authors ,",
    "see , for example , @xcite .",
    "applications of the main theorem to special cases of practical importance ( stationary processes , fractional brownian motion , etc . ) are demonstrated .",
    "we also prove the exponential rate of convergence of the wavelet expansions .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we impose minimal assumptions on the wavelet bases .",
    "the results are obtained under simple conditions which can be easily verified .",
    "the conditions are weaker than those in the former literature",
    ".    these are novel results on stochastic uniform convergence of general finite wavelet expansions of nonstationary random processes .",
    "the specifications of established results are also new ( for example , for the case of stationary stochastic processes , compare @xcite ) .    finally , it should be mentioned that the analysis of the rate of convergence gives a constructive algorithm for determining the number of terms in the wavelet expansions to ensure the uniform approximation of stochastic processes with given accuracy .",
    "it provides a practical way to obtain explicit bounds on the sharpness of finite wavelet series approximations .",
    "the organization of the article is the following . in the second section",
    "we introduce the necessary background from wavelet theory and certain sufficient conditions for mean - square convergence of wavelet expansions in the space @xmath4 in  3 we formulate and discuss the main theorem on uniform convergence in probability of the wavelet expansions of gaussian random processes .",
    "the next section contains the proof of the main theorem .",
    "two applications of the developed technique are shown in section 4 . in  5 the main theorem",
    "is adjusted to the fractional brownian motion case .",
