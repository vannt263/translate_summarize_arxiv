    "over the last decade , serious observational effort has gone into detecting trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) , but despite increasing resources dedicated to the problem there is still a steady stream of surprises .",
    "so little light is reflected from distant tnos that it is the very inner edge ( within 50  au ) of the kuiper belt region that dominates detections in observational surveys ( those with more than 10 include @xcite ) .",
    "the majority of kuiper belt detections come from these flux - limited surveys near the ecliptic plane .",
    "this results in a bias against objects which are distant ( since reflected flux @xmath4 ) , on highly - inclined orbits ( which spend very little time in the ecliptic plane ) , or intrinsically rare ( like the very largest tnos ) .",
    "these biases are gradually being overcome , and new dynamical classes within the kuiper belt are being discovered .",
    "these sub - populations of the kuiper belt ( see @xcite for a recent review ) preserve a record of the dynamical processes which governed the formation of the giant planets .",
    "the low - eccentricity ` classical belt ' appears to decline rapidly at the location of the 2:1 mean - motion resonance @xcite other mean - motion resonances are occupied both inside and outside the 2:1 , although outside the 2:1 objects are only present at high eccentricity ( with the possible exception of 2004  xr190 ) .",
    "the scattered disk population of tnos has perihelia @xmath5  au but large semimajor axes @xmath6 ; this is a decaying population that has presumably been flung to large-@xmath6 via scattering with neptune @xcite . finally , the extended scattered disk ( which eventually merges into the inner oort cloud ) consists of tnos on stable orbits , pointing to some process capable of lowering the orbital eccentricities of vast numbers of scattered disk objects @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we report the discovery of a new extended scattered - disk object with a nearly - circular orbit beyond the edge of the classical belt and also with one of the highest orbital inclinations known .",
    "the object reported here was discovered in routine data reduction of the canada - france ecliptic plane survey ( cfeps ) @xcite .",
    "the internal survey designation was 0716p004b7 and it has received minor planet center designation 2004  xr190 ( in mpec 2005-x72 @xcite ) . in this section ,",
    "we describe the discovery and tracking observations up to 2005 december 10 .",
    "2004  xr190 was discovered in images taken as part of the canada - france legacy survey using data from the very - wide component ( cfls - vw ) on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) 3.5-m and megacam ccd camera .",
    "the images were processed by cfht using their elixir data processing pipeline @xcite , and then searched for tnos with our moving - object software @xcite .",
    "2004  xr190 was clearly identified by the software , being about 2 magnitudes above the limit and uncontaminated by background objects .",
    "a fourth image , taken on the following night , gave a preliminary orbit indicating the object s distance was well beyond 50  au .",
    "these exposures were taken on 2004 , december  11 and 12 , using an @xmath7 filter and 90-second exposure times .",
    "2004  xr190 was measured to have an @xmath7 magnitude of @xmath8 in these short exposures .",
    "astrometry of 2004  xr190 from the discovery images indicated it was at a barycentric distance of @xmath9  au when an orbital solution was fit using the @xcite software .",
    "this indicates its diameter is between 425850  km for a range of albedo of 164% .",
    "although orbital elements are poorly constrained with only a 24-hour arc , because the observations were taken at opposition the distance estimate from 2-nights of observation was felt to be accurate to 10% .",
    "even with the uncertainty , this made 2004  xr190 one of the most distant tnos ever discovered .",
    "much more uncertain at the time , but even more exciting , was the fact that its preliminary orbit indicated that @xmath10  au , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the unusual nature of this orbit and the large barycentric distance led us to follow this object at the next opportunity in 2005 .      on 2005 october 3 and 4 ,",
    "a first set of recovery observations was obtained at the palomar 5-m using the large - format camera .",
    "observations taken one year after a 24-hour arc generally have a very large ephemeris uncertainty @xcite , around @xmath14 in this case . however , 2004  xr190 was immediately visible in the field within @xmath15 of the prediction from the nominal nearly - circular orbit . incorporating the new astrometric measurements indicated that the distance was indeed @xmath16  au , although the best - fit orbit became more eccentric with a higher @xmath6 ( @xmath17  au , @xmath18 ) .",
    "this recovery also confirmed that 2004  xr190 had one of the largest orbital inclinations of any tno ( then @xmath19 ) ; only one other classical kbo and one scattered disk object have higher inclinations .",
    "this pattern of orbits changing from near - circular to elliptical often emerges when fitting increasing arc - lengths with the bernstein & khushalani code , as the orbit assumptions are changed as the observational arc grows .",
    "however , the uncertainties remain large and the final orbit remains within these limits .",
    "further observations took place in 2005 , at the mdm 2.4-m on october 15 , at the kitt peak mayall 4-m on november 4 and 6 , and again at cfht on december 1 .",
    "although these observations only increased the arc - length from 10 to 12 months , because of the spread of the observational geometry relative to opposition , orbital - element uncertainties dropped very rapidly . including all available observations , we find the best - fit orbit to be @xmath20  au , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , with node=@xmath23 , argument of perihelion @xmath24 , and time of perihelion passage of jd=@xmath25 .    while the large current barycentric distance of @xmath26  au and high inclination are unusual , a third , and probably most important , feature of this orbit is its large pericentric distance .",
    "the uncertainties quoted above in @xmath6 and @xmath27 are correlated ; increases in @xmath27 necessitate an increase in @xmath6 to continue to fit the observations , as illustrated in figure  [ 4b7error ] .",
    "as such , the limits on @xmath28 are stricter than the simple one - sigma limits above . taking into account this correlation",
    ", we find that the lowest possible @xmath28 compatible with the observations , at the one - sigma level , is in fact 49.4  au .",
    "this places 2004  xr190 in the extended scattered disk , although its eccentricity is the lowest of any member of this group .",
    "2004  xr190 is unlike any other member of the kuiper belt , due to its high pericenter and highly - inclined orbit , as illustrated in figure  [ aeifig ] . with a fairly circular orbit beyond 50",
    "au , it would be tempting to think of this object as the first member of a `` cold distant belt '' ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , its high inclination suggests that it has experienced a strong dynamical perturbation in its history .",
    "we discovered 2004  xr190 only @xmath29 away from the ecliptic plane . with @xmath30",
    ", it spends only a tiny fraction ( @xmath31 ) of its orbit within this limit .",
    "most tno surveys do not extend further than a few degrees from the ecliptic plane , and so have poor sensitivity to tnos on such high-@xmath32 orbits .",
    "the on - going caltech survey@xcite has covered a major fraction of the sky within 10 degrees of the ecliptic , and is increasing coverage further away .",
    "the limit of this survey in in the range @xmath33@xmath34 , such that objects must be pluto - scale or larger to be detected beyond a distance of 60  au . with these selection effects , we can not rule out a large population of high-@xmath32 objects like 2004  xr190 . however , a population with similar @xmath6 and @xmath27 but low-@xmath32 should have been undetected in prior surveys .",
    "indeed , @xcite and @xcite sets strong limits on such a distant ` cold belt ' .",
    "therefore , we conclude that 2004  xr190 does not represent the high - inclination end of a dynamically cold population beyond 50  au .",
    "more likely is that this discovery is a member of an as - yet poorly characterized very high-@xmath32 group .",
    "because of the presence of other very highly - inclined tnos in the classical belt and the scattered disk , it is unclear if the highest - inclination population is especially concentrated in the extended scattered disk or if it extends throughout the kuiper belt .",
    "placing a tno onto a nearly - circular orbit near 60  au with a high inclination , while simulataneously leaving intact the inner kuiper belt and depopulating the low inclination orbits beyond the 2:1 resonance , is a challenge for theories seeking to create the extended scattered disk .",
    "these theories include close stellar passages , rogue planets / planetary embryos in the early kuiper belt , and resonance interaction with a migrating neptune .    in stellar passage models ,",
    "a star has a close encounter with the primordial kuiper belt or scattered disk .",
    "the end result of these encounters is a kuiper belt which transitions from a slightly - perturbed to a greatly - perturbed state beyond some critical distance@xcite .",
    "generally , objects produced with high inclination in these models also have high eccentricities , which make it difficult to produce 2004  xr190 .",
    "typically the stellar passage scenarios leave behind an extended scattered disk in which the mean inclination of the extended scattered disk objects ( esdos ) rises as one moves to larger semimajor axes . with the addition of 2004  xr190 to the suite of esdos 1995  tl8 , 2000  yw134 , 2000  cr105 , and 2003  vb12/sedna @xcite , the current trend appears to be the opposite .",
    "while the lower-@xmath6 esdos should indeed be detected in greater numbers first ( due to distance / flux detection biases ) , the lack of high-@xmath32 esdos with @xmath35  au might be viewed as a problem for stellar passage models .",
    "recent simulations by @xcite show that a 12 earth mass rogue planet living temporarily in the scattered disk can effectively create high-@xmath28 esdos .",
    "production of objects with orbital inclinations above 40 degrees is possible but not efficient , and the high-@xmath32 objects that are created tend to be at the lowest semimajor axes ( @xmath36  au ) . if tnos with orbital inclinations above @xmath37 are discovered beyond @xmath38  au then a stellar passage scenario should indeed be favoured .",
    "if this method did produce 2004  xr190 , @xmath39  au , @xmath40 tnos should soon be discovered with inclinations between 1040@xmath41 .",
    "an intriguing explanation is that 2004  xr190 evolved to its current orbit after being trapped in a mean - motion resonance with neptune while neptune migrated outwards . in this model ,",
    "tnos are trapped into resonance and evolve onto higher semi - major axis orbits as neptune migrates outward , increasing their eccentricities in the process @xcite .",
    "this process is inefficient at increasing orbital inclinations to large values if the trapped objects begin on circular orbits .",
    "however , . a similar effect can occur if already - eccentric tnos become trapped in the resonance during neptune s migration .",
    "this can result in inclination pumping , primarily due to the kozai resonance .",
    "although weak in the kuiper belt outside of mean - motion resonances , inside or near the edges of these resonances the kozai effect is capable of transferring the orbital eccentricity into an elevated inclination @xcite .",
    "if the object then drops out of the resonance , it will be left on a high-@xmath32 , low-@xmath27 orbit relatively stable against the gravitational perturbations of neptune and the other giant planets .",
    "this could explain 2004  xr190 s orbit , without requiring low-@xmath32 objects of similar semi - major axis .",
    "@xcite show an example of this process using the 5:2 mean - motion resonance , but this resonance is interior to the best - estimate semimajor axis of 2004  xr190 , so use of the 5:2 resonance to produce the orbit would require a final inward migration of neptune .",
    "this is not impossible , as @xcite show that both inward and outward neptune migration can occur .",
    "2004  xr190 s best - fit orbit is in fact closer to the 8:3 than the 5:2 mean motion resonance .",
    "unfortunately , the ability of the 8:3 resonance to participate in this mechanism has not been demonstrated .",
    "no published numerical models appear to exhibit trapping and strong inclination pumping in the 8:3 resonance .",
    "we have conducted preliminary orbital integrations of a suite of particles consistent with the 1-sigma uncertainties of 2004  xr190 s orbital elements .",
    "we integrated 100 clones for @xmath42 years .",
    "the vast majority of these clones show small ( @xmath43 ) variations in eccentricity over this time period .",
    "however , given the current uncertainties in the orbit , we find that there is a roughly 5% chance ( see fig .",
    "[ 4b7error ] ) that xr190 has orbital elements that would allow it to be strongly influenced by the 8:3 resonance . the resonant particles ( as diagnosed by libration of the angle @xmath44 during the intgrations ) show an extremely strong kozai response which brings the perihelia down into the scattered disk region ( @xmath45  au ) within @xmath42 years .",
    "we extended the integration of the resonant clones to @xmath46 years .",
    "the behavior of one of these resonant particles is illustrated in figure  [ resonantfig ] ; in this case the particle actually crosses neptune s orbit after 80myrs .",
    "we have confirmed that @xmath27 , @xmath32 , and @xmath47 show the correct coupled kozai behavior .",
    "this raises the possibility , if future observations result in a resonant orbit , that xr190 is only temporarily resident in the low - eccentricity domain . in this scenario ,",
    "2004  xr190 could have recently ( as little as a few tens of millions of years ago ) been a scattered disk object , which is simply undergoing a low - eccentricity episode by virtue of having been fortuitously near the resonance boundary after a neptune - scattering event .",
    "the dynamics of this near - resonance should be further explored if observations in early 2006 confirm that @xmath6 and @xmath27 are both at the high end of the currently - allowed range .",
    "even if future observations show 2004  xr190 has @xmath6 just below that of the resonance ( as the current best - fit orbit indicates ) , the strong resonant response seen in our integrations does suggest the possiblity that a resonant dropoff mechanism could have delivered it to its current location .",
    "we have presented the discovery of an unusual tno , 2004  xr190 . with a perihelion at @xmath48  au , and a low - eccentricity orbit ,",
    "it is the closest to a ` distant cold kuiper belt ' object which has been detected so far .",
    "however , with an inclination of @xmath49 , it has clearly been dynamically perturbed at some point in its lifetime .",
    "a plausible explanation of the origin of 2004  xr190 s high inclination and low eccentricity is the action of the kozai effect during a past residence inside the 5:2 or 8:3 mean - motion resonances of neptune .",
    "if neptune migrated outwards , dropping the tno out of resonance , this could aid in freezing the @xmath27/@xmath32 combination observed today .",
    "the modification of its orbit could also be produced by now - absent bodies ( rogue planets or passing stars ) , but producing all of the features present in the transneptunian region is problematic for all of the above models .",
    "this paper would not be possible without observations obtained at a number of telescopes .    based on observations obtained with megaprime / megacam , a joint project of cfht and cae / dapnia , at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) which is operated by the national research council ( nrc ) of canada , the institut national des science de lunivers of the centre national de la recherche scientifique ( cnrs ) of france , and the university of hawaii .",
    "this work is based in part on data products produced at terapix and the canadian astronomy data centre as part of the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey , a collaborative project of nrc and cnrs .",
    "also based partly on observations obtained at the hale telescope , palomar observatory , as part of a collaborative agreement between the california institute of technology , its divisions caltech optical observatories and the jet propulsion laboratory ( operated for nasa ) , and cornell university .",
