    "effective interactions used in microscopic mean - field models are built from nuclear ingredients such as ground - state properties of selected nuclei and infinite nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "no information coming from rotational bands of deformed nuclei is a priori implemented in these forces .",
    "the variation of the moment of inertia along a band is related to the evolution of pairing correlations with rotation .",
    "such a variation brings other constraints on the structure and the strength of the pairing interaction  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , properties of bands in odd - mass nuclei are a fingerprint of the quasi - particle excitations on which they are built and , thus , of the single - particle spectra predicted by the effective mean - field interaction . experimental study of rotational spectra in nuclei far from stability is thus an important tool to test the predictive power of these forces .",
    "the recent experimental results for the nobelium isotopes @xmath3no and @xmath4no  @xcite are in this respect of particular importance .",
    "they bring data in a region close to the domain of super - heavy nuclei , where our knowledge of single - particle spectra and of pairing correlations is particularly limited .",
    "since then , further experiments have been proposed or are already underway for other even - even and odd - mass nuclei in this mass region ; new results are expected to appear soon .",
    "this experimental context has triggered a number of theoretical studies with various mean - field models .",
    "fully self - consistent cranked hfb calculations have been performed for selected nuclei with several interactions : the gogny force  @xcite , the skyrme interactions sly4 and a density - dependent pairing force  @xcite and skm * together with a schematic pairing force  @xcite .",
    "the relativistic mean - field model @xcite has also been applied to this domain .",
    "finally , let us quote the large scale microscopic - macroscopic study of muntian  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present calculations for the rotational bands of some even - even nuclides in the mass region and of odd - mass isotopes differing from @xmath3no or @xmath4no by either one neutron or one proton .",
    "we also discuss the spectra of quasi - particle states expected for these nuclei .",
    "first , we briefly recall our method and present its main ingredients .",
    "we then calculate the spectra and rotational bands of the heaviest isotopes for which there are extensive experimental data .",
    "finally , we calculate spectra and rotational bands of nuclei around the no isotopes .",
    "we have performed cranked hfb calculations following the method described in ref .",
    "the sly4 parameterization of the skyrme interaction  @xcite is chosen in the mean - field ( particle - hole ) channel . in the pairing ( particle - particle ) channel",
    ", we use a zero - range density - dependent force with the strength ( @xmath5 mev  @xmath6 ) and cutoff ( 5  mev ) as in our previous study of @xmath7no  @xcite .",
    "the lipkin - nogami prescription is utilized to prevent a collapse of pairing correlations at high angular momentum .",
    "quasi - particle excitations are calculated fully self - consistently  @xcite .",
    "the effect of core polarization and of the blocking of a pair of states are thus exactly taken into account .",
    "this model has been successfully used to describe super - deformed rotational bands  @xcite and super - heavy nuclei  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have compared our results with data on rotational bands of @xmath3no and @xmath4no .",
    "the single - particle levels of @xmath4no are plotted in figure  [ fig : sp : no ] as a function of the axial quadrupole moment .",
    "these energies are eigenvalues of the particle - hole part of the hfb hamiltonian .",
    "they provide a useful link to simpler models .",
    "the proton level density around the fermi surface is rather low at deformations around which is the deformation that we obtain for @xmath4no . in this region , there are numerous deformed shell closures in the proton spectrum : at and 100 , below @xmath4no and also at , 108 , 110 . at the same deformation , there are regions of low neutron level density around and 152 as well as .      before applying our method to nuclei",
    "for which experimental data are sparse , let us focus on the spectra of @xmath8cf and @xmath9bk which are the heaviest odd - neutron and odd - proton nuclei for which the low energy spectra are rather well known .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra : expt ] gives the spectra of these odd nuclei calculated self - consistently from one quasi - particle excitations ( 1qp ) built on an hfb vacuum .",
    "all states which are calculated to lie below 1.2  mev are compared with experiment .",
    "data are from ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein for both nuclei and also from ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath8cf .",
    "the states we have calculated in @xmath8cf are characterized by a deformation @xmath10 around 0.26 , with the exception of the @xmath11 state at 410  kev , which is significantly more deformed ( @xmath12 using the relation between @xmath10 and the quadrupole and hexadecapole moments given in ref .",
    "these values are significantly larger than the fixed @xmath10 value used by wiok  @xcite ( 0.247 ) in their calculations based on a woods - saxon potential and the strutinsky prescription . however , a clear conclusion is difficult to draw : in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath10 is _ a priori _ fixed to be the same for all levels , whereas in self - consistent mean - field calculations , deformation is optimized level per level .",
    "in addition , the 1qp energies given in  @xcite are eigenvalues of the hfb hamiltonian using an average potential , while our 1qp energies are total binding energy differences between self - consistent one quasi - particle states .",
    "the ground state of @xmath8cf is obtained from the 1qp excitation predominantly based on the first single - particle state above the fermi level , which has a spin of @xmath13 , in agreement with the data .",
    "the first three excited levels correspond to 1qp states based on the single - particle levels just above ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) or just below ( @xmath16 ) the fermi level .",
    "this result is also consistent with experiment , with the largest error on the @xmath16 state , too low by almost 300  kev . at higher excitation energies ,",
    "the energy of the @xmath17 state is largely overestimated by our calculation .",
    "other states are predicted with an accuracy of the order of 300  kev .",
    "we also obtain a @xmath15 state at 700  kev .",
    "experimentally , the @xmath18 state at 981  kev and the @xmath15 state at 1078  kev have been interpreted as due to the coupling of the @xmath15 1qp excitation with the @xmath19 octupole vibration and the @xmath20 pair vibration respectively .",
    "these states are thus outside the scope of our calculation .",
    "no @xmath18 single - particle state is obtained below 1.2  mev in our calculation .",
    "a rather similar spectrum is obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , with however a much better energy for the @xmath17 state at  370 kev .",
    "the rmf results of ref .",
    "@xcite are in similar agreement with the data than ours , with , however a less dense spectrum for the two interactions that were tested .",
    "we obtain a spin @xmath18 for the ground state of @xmath9bk . the largest discrepancy with experiment isthe much too high energy for the @xmath15 state which is experimentally",
    "nearly degenerate with the ground state .",
    "our calculation also significantly overestimates the energy of the first @xmath13 state .",
    "all states have a very similar deformation @xmath10 around 0.255 .",
    "this value is slightly larger than the fixed 0.243 value used in  @xcite .",
    "the spin obtained in  @xcite for the ground state is @xmath18 , but the @xmath15 state is excited by only 150  kev .",
    "the rmf calculation  @xcite is in slightly better agreement with the data than our results , mainly because of a better energy for the @xmath15 state .",
    "it is tempting to interpret the discrepancies observed between the calculated and experimental spectra in terms of the ordering of the single - particle levels at sphericity . for the neutrons and the @xmath8cf spectrum ,",
    "the too low 1qp energy of the @xmath16 state above the fermi level and the too high energy of the @xmath17 state below the fermi level could be corrected by a lowering of the energy of the @xmath21 sub - shell .",
    "this would increase the spherical energy gap , and also slightly reduce the deformed gap at in favor of an increased gap for typical ground state deformations around .",
    "the fact that the self - consistent models underestimate the shell effect is also suggested by the experimental two - neutron separation energies  @xcite and @xmath22 values  @xcite .",
    "the positions of the @xmath23 and @xmath15 states in @xmath9bk would be in better agreement with the data if the @xmath24 shell were lower and if the splitting between the @xmath18 and the @xmath11 orbitals ( labeled as @xmath253/2 ^ -$ ] and @xmath251/2-$ ] nilsson states ) was reduced by closer spherical @xmath26 and @xmath27 shells .",
    "a lowering of the energies of the @xmath21 neutron and @xmath24 proton sub - shells can be achieved by an increase of the spin - orbit strength .",
    "however , this is not consistent with analyses showing that most skyrme interactions overestimate the spin - orbit splitting in heavy nuclei  @xcite . in any case , to improve the description of the spectra by modifying the effective force requires deeper modifications than just the spin - orbit strength .",
    "one must also note that slight shifts of the levels could result from deformation modes not included in our model , like the octupole mode .",
    "such modifications of the spherical sub - shells would affect the shell gaps for super - heavy nuclei .",
    "it would lead to a reduction of the deformed gap and an increase of the gap , in better agreement with the sparse available data . at the same time , the modified @xmath24 and @xmath26 sub - shells would affect the gap in opposite ways and might not change it quantitatively . note that most parameterizations of the rmf model predict the proton @xmath24 sub - shell to be below the @xmath26 state  @xcite .",
    "however , speculations about the magicity of and based solely on the deformed one quasi - particle states in @xmath9bk is questionable as increasing the charge number polarizes the nuclear density distribution , which feeds back into the single - particle spectra .",
    "for example , the spin - orbit splitting of @xmath28 and @xmath29 levels nearly vanishes for nuclides with semi - bubble shapes  @xcite that are predicted to appear around @xmath30120  @xcite .",
    "one must also keep in mind that large changes in the single - particle spectra will also affect other regions of the mass table .",
    "in particular , the lower members of the intruder proton @xmath24 and neutron @xmath21 orbitals are responsible of several super - deformed rotational bands in the mass region and can not be changed by more than one or two hundred kev  @xcite .",
    "recently , conversion electron cascades have been measured by butler  @xcite .",
    "the presence of high k - isomers was conjectured to explain the observed intensities .",
    "we have calculated the 2qp - excitations in @xmath4no which can lead to high k - states .",
    "most of them have excitation energies significantly larger than 2.0  mev .",
    "the 2qp @xmath31 state based on @xmath15 and @xmath32 particle states ( see figure  [ fig : sp : no ] ) is the only excitation that our calculation gives below 2.0  mev , around 1.5  mev .",
    "we have also determined its magnetic moment following the method developed by hamamoto  @xcite .",
    "this configuration has a very large magnetic moment , around 1.5  w.u .",
    ", as do several of the more excited configurations .",
    "whether such a result is consistent with the present analysis of the experimental data requires further investigation .      here , we discuss results of our method for the rotational bands of @xmath33pu and @xmath34pu for which recent detailed experimental data  @xcite have become available .",
    "the kinematic ( @xmath35 ) and dynamic ( @xmath36 ) moments of inertia are compared with experiment in figure  [ fig : j : pu ] .    in both cases ,",
    "the @xmath35 moment is in close agreement with the data at all rotational frequencies , while @xmath36 is overestimated at high rotational frequencies in a more pronounced way for @xmath33pu than for @xmath34pu . in @xmath34pu",
    ", the calculation slightly underestimates the rotational frequency at which the alignment of a proton @xmath37 occurs .",
    "the same alignment does not occur in @xmath33pu up to  @xmath38 , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "it has been suggested that this absence is due to octupole correlations  @xcite which however are not included in our calculation .",
    "further investigations are necessary to clarify this point .",
    "the spectra of four selected odd - mass nuclei around @xmath7no are presented on figure  [ fig : spectra : odd ] .",
    "all states are obtained by self - consistent 1qp excitation on a hfb vacuum .",
    "the experimental data on these nuclei are sparse  @xcite .",
    "let us focus first on the two odd - proton nuclei for which there are no data . as expected from the single - particle spectrum of figure  [ fig : spectra : expt ] , the ground state of @xmath8md has a calculated spin @xmath11 , with two closely packed @xmath39 states of opposite parity around 200  kev . for @xmath40lr ,",
    "the three same spins appear at low energy , with a @xmath32 ground state and two excited states below 0.5  mev .",
    "three more states than in @xmath8md are obtained below 1.0  mev .",
    "this is a consequence of the denser single - particle spectrum above @xmath41 .",
    "wiok  @xcite have obtained similar but less dense spectra , with the same spins for the ground states .",
    "the main difference relies in the position of @xmath42 states . in @xmath40lr",
    ", we obtain a state at an energy around 600  kev higher than in ref .  @xcite . in @xmath8md , we do not obtain it below 1.5  mev .",
    "these differences are probably related to the position of the @xmath37 sub - shell discussed above .",
    "the ground state of @xmath43no is predicted to be a @xmath16 level , in agreement with the tentative experimental assignment  @xcite .",
    "note that this state arises from the @xmath37 sub - shell .",
    "a lowering of this sub - shell by more than a few 100  kev will affect the ordering of the @xmath43no first levels .",
    "the spectrum that we obtain is in overall good agreement with the results of ref .",
    "in particular and contrary to the spectrum reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , we do not obtain a @xmath17 state at low energy . however , our calculation predicts a @xmath13 state at 300  kev . we have also calculated the magnetic moments of these states which turn out to be rather large ( 1  w.u . for the @xmath16 , 0.25  w.u . for the @xmath13 and 0.1  w.u . for the @xmath15 ) .",
    "hence , low lying states of rotational bands build on these excitations will deexcite predominantly via @xmath44 transitions .",
    "the ground state of @xmath40no is a @xmath13 state , nearly degenerate with a @xmath14 state .",
    "two other states are predicted to lie below 300 kev , as can be expected from the neutron single - particle spectrum of figure  [ fig : sp : no ]",
    ".      calculated moments of inertia for the even - even nuclei with 104 and , 152 are shown in figure  [ fig : j : even ] .",
    "experimental data for @xmath3no are taken from  @xcite , data for @xmath4no from  @xcite .",
    "the overall behavior of the moments of inertia of the fm and rf isotopes is very similar to the one obtained previously in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath3no and @xmath4no .",
    "the predicted alignment for @xmath3no underestimates the data , while for @xmath4no calculations and experiement are in reasonable agreement .",
    "the heavy isotones @xmath4no and @xmath45rf have a significantly slower alignment than the other nuclides , with a minimum predicted for @xmath4no .",
    "following our previous discussion on the location of the high @xmath46 states , we observe that an energy decrease for the @xmath47 orbital would result in a faster alignment in @xmath3no and a slower one in @xmath4no , as can be inferred from the quasi - particle energies given on figure  4 in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the moment of inertia of selected bands in odd - mass nuclei are plotted in figure  [ fig : j : odd ] .",
    "the odd proton isotopes have rather similar moment of inertia , the @xmath11 and @xmath32 bands in @xmath8md behaving in essentially the same way .",
    "in this work , we have compared our self - consistent mean - field calculations with the heaviest two odd nuclei for which the single - particle spectrum is reasonably known , @xmath8cf and @xmath9bk .",
    "the qualitative overall agreement is rather good , in spite of some discrepancies for a few states .",
    "this gives us confidence in our results for the other , less known , nuclei that we studied in this mass region .",
    "in particular , our results may be of some value for experiments intended to explore any of these nuclei . however , one should bear in mind that these states have been calculated with the hfb formalism",
    ". there is , therefore , no guarantee that they are orthogonal , especially when corresponding to the same parity and @xmath48 value .",
    "mean - field models  @xcite predict different neutron and proton numbers for spherical , doubly magic super - heavy nuclei .",
    "the mass region we have explored is the heaviest one for which one has sufficient experimental knowledge to extract some information relevant to the single particle spectra .",
    "however , this information and its consequence on magic numbers can not be extrapolated without care from @xmath4no to higher masses .",
    "for instance , deformation of the density arising from multipole moments higher than the quadrupole one are automatically taken into account in microscopic mean - field calculations .",
    "as these higher moments change rapidly with nucleon numbers , substantial modifications in the single - particle spectrum and thus of magic numbers may be expected ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "another interesting finding is the sensitivity of the calculated spectra of odd nuclides to the precise location of individual orbitals . in these very heavy nuclei ,",
    "the density of levels is higher than for lower masses .",
    "one may thus speculate that a slight modification of the spin - orbit strength could result in some significant changes in excitation spectra in this mass region while remaining of no importance for lighter nuclei .",
    "this points to the necessity of a careful analysis of the spin orbit strength in standard fit procedure of effective forces , which is beyond the scope of the present work .",
