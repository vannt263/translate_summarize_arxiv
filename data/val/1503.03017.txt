    "infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) are believed to represent the earliest stage in the formation of massive stars .",
    "observations in different bands of the infrared wavelength have significantly improved our understanding of the dynamics of these clouds .",
    "the early identifications of irdcs based on the iso and msx data @xcite are extended by observations with the spitzer space telescope .",
    "higher resolution images in the spitzer irac bands reveal intricate details of irdcs thanks to galactic plane surveys such as glimpse @xcite .",
    "observations by the herschel space observatory provide a complementary view of irdcs at far ir wavelengths @xcite .",
    "some of the irdcs remain in absorption at the 70 @xmath3 m band of the herschel space observatory , and transition to emission in the 250 , 350 and 500 @xmath3 m bands .",
    "these 70 @xmath3m - dark irdcs may represent dense clouds at the earliest evolution stage of star formation .    among the irdcs ,",
    "those with masses of @xmath4  or higher at a scale of @xmath51 pc are the prime candidates to study massive star and cluster formation , which hereafter we refer to as clumps pc , a molecular _ clump _ as an entity of @xmath6 1 pc that forms massive stars with a population of lower mass stars , and _ dense cores _ as an entity of 0.01 to 0.1 pc that forms one or a group of stars , and _ condensations _ as an entity of @xmath6 0.01 pc . ] .",
    "these clumps contain molecular masses similar to those that harbor massive protostars @xcite and hypercompact hii regions @xcite , whose relatively large luminosities ( @xmath7 ) , the presence of complex molecules @xcite , and massive and energetic outflows @xcite all point to active massive star formation .",
    "in contrast to clouds with embedded massive star formation , irdc clumps show few signs of star formation despite their large reservoir of molecular gas at high densities of @xmath8 3 . a survey toward 144 irdc clumps for h@xmath9o masers , a signpost of star formation , found only 14% of maser occurrence in the sample @xcite , a frequency much lower than that in high - mass protostellar objects and hii regions @xcite .",
    "in addition , irdcs have consistently lower gas temperatures and line widths .",
    "studies in 3 found that they have a temperature on the order of 15 k , and a line width on the order of 2 -1  averaged over a spatial scale of 1pc @xcite , lower than those in high - mass protostellar objects ( hmpos ) and hii regions @xcite .",
    "these characteristics , together with their low luminosities , place massive irdc clumps at an earlier evolutionary stage than hmpos and hii regions @xcite .",
    "high resolution observations of irdc clumps reveal structures at @xmath6 0.1pc scales and provide first glimpses of initial physical and chemical states of cluster star formation .",
    "irdcs tend to have high deuteration fractionation and co depletion @xcite , as expected in a low temperature and high density environment @xcite .",
    "thermodynamic analysis found that cores in some clumps are sub - virial , with their gas mass a factor of several greater than the virial mass derived from the line width @xcite .",
    "considering that these cores are embedded in dense clumps with substantial external pressure , the imbalance between the gravitational mass and the internal support can be even larger .",
    "these analyses do not include magnetic fields , which supply additional support .",
    "indeed , in a recent polarization survey of 14 massive clumps with hmpos , @xcite found that magnetic fields are important during the formation of dense cores .",
    "the plane - of - sky component of magnetic fields derived from statistical analysis is typically 1 - 10 mg @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field strength required for a virial balance in these irdcs cores , on the other hand , is on an order of 0.5 mg .",
    "therefore , irdc cores can still be in a virial equilibrium for a moderate magnetic field @xcite .     understanding the formation of massive cores is an essential precursor to improving our understanding of the formation of star clusters . for a typical star - formation efficiency of 10 - 30 % @xcite , and for a cluster having a salpeter type initial stellar mass function ( imf )",
    ", one would expect a @xmath4  clump to form a cluster of mass between 100 to 300 , with at least 75 stars of mass between 0.5 - 20 .",
    "therefore , significant fragmentation of molecular gas is required in the clump in order to form a cluster of stars .",
    "in such a cluster environment , the majority of stars are at stellar masses of @xmath6 1 , which corresponds well to the thermal jeans mass in the clump with a typical temperature of 15 k and a density of @xmath10 3 @xcite .",
    "the question arises when it comes to forming stars around 10  or larger .",
    "although hot cores surrounding massive protostars often have masses @xmath11  at a scale of @xmath6 0.1pc based on direct high angular resolution observations ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they may not represent the state of early fragmentation @xcite .",
    "observations of massive irdcs provide direct insights into formation of massive cores .",
    "indeed , significant fragmentation is observed in massive molecular clumps @xcite .",
    "these studies find that massive cores are typically 10 to @xmath12 times more massive than the thermal jeans mass , pointing to a significant support from turbulence as well as perhaps magnetic fields .",
    "in addition , cores tend to further fragment , indicating that massive stars form in close groups .",
    "this paper extends the study of a massive irdc g28.34 - 0.06 ( hereafter g28.34 ) and presents sensitive alma observations of continuum and molecular line emission at the 230 ghz band .",

    "figure 1 presents an overview of this region from the mid , far infrared to 1.3 mm continuum , and gas in 3 .",
    "two prominent dust continuum clumps , p1 and p2 , are revealed in the 850 and 450 @xmath3 m images obtained from the jcmt @xcite .",
    "besides these two massive clumps , additional continuum peaks are revealed in the 1.2 mm image obtained from the iram 30 m telescope @xcite . despite the fact that p1 and p2 clumps contain a similar amount of dense gas within 0.3 pc",
    ", the p2 region has a high gas temperature of 30 k , large 3 fwhm line width of 3.3 -1 and is associated with a strong 24 @xmath3 m point source with far ir luminosity of @xmath4 , and with emission of complex organic molecules such as ch@xmath14och@xmath14 and ch@xmath14cho @xcite .",
    "this region is in contrast to p1 which has a gas temperature of 13 k , a relatively narrow 3 line width of 2.7 -1 , and an upper limit to the luminosity of @xmath12  ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper i ) , and devoids of a complex molecular chemistry .",
    "furthermore , the gas in p1 appears to be externally heated with temperatures decreasing from 20 k in the outside of the cloud to 13 k inside of the cloud .",
    "likewise , the turbulence measured by the 3 line widths appears to decrease from pc scales to 0.1 scales .",
    "these observations led @xcite to suggest that p1 is at a much earlier stage of massive star formation compared to p2 .",

    "furthermore , these cores follow turbulent fragmentation , rather than thermal fragmentation .",
    "our previous observations of g28.34 with the sma do not have adequate sensitivity and/or dynamic range to reliably detect fragments of thermal jeans mass ( approximately 2 ) .",
    "in addition , the chemical properties in these cores are largely unknown due to a lack of detection of molecular line emission . here",
    ", we present alma observations of g28.34 p1 in band 6 ( 230 ghz ) .",
    "the continuum data reach a @xmath15 rms of 75 @xmath3jy , or 0.065  at 1.3 mm assuming a dust temperature of 15 k. there is a lack of a population of low - mass protostars with masses down to @xmath16  within the clump .",
    "the observations also reveal a plethora of molecules arising from five intermediate - mass cores .",
    "this paper focuses on the analysis of physical properties of the region , and potential population of low - mass protostars in the protocluster .",

    "section 3 presents results , and in section 4 , we discuss the implication of the data relevant to cluster formation .",
    "section 5 presents the conclusion of the study .",
    "g28.34 p1 was observed with atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) on 2012 november 15 in its extended configuration with a total of 29 12-m antennas in the array ( project i d : 2011.0.00429.s ) . including time for calibration , the observing session lasted about 1.5 hours .",
    "the actual time on - source is 34 mins .",
    "the precipitable water vapor ( pwv ) was about 1.5 mm , resulting in system temperatures of 80 to 100 k at the observing frequencies .",
    "the observations employed the band 6 ( 230 ghz ) receivers in dual polarization mode .",
    "the projected baselines range from 15 m to 400 m ( 11.5 - 308 k@xmath17 ) .",
    "the resulting synthesized beam is @xmath18 when using a robust weighting parameter of 0.5 .",
    "the fwhm primary beam of the alma 12-m antennas is approximately 27@xmath19 at the observing frequencies . to maximize continuum sensitivity",
    ", we used all 4 spectral windows with a bandwidth of 1.875 ghz in each window .",
    "the correlator was set in the fmt mode which provides a uniform channel width of 488.3 khz ( 0.62 - 0.67 -1  at the observing frequencies ) .",
    "the frequency coverage of the data range from 218.07 to 219.95 ghz in spw0 , from 215.62 to 217.49 ghz in spw1 , from 230.18 to 232.06 ghz in spw2 , and from 232.82 to 234.70 ghz in spw3 , respectively .",
    "quasars j1751 + 096 and j1830 + 063 were used for bandpass and time dependent gain calibration , respectively .",
    "the flux calibration was achieved by observations of neptune .",
    "the visibility data were calibrated in casa by the alma supporting staff .",
    "we construct continuum visibility data using the line free spectral channels for the science target g28.34 p1 .",
    "the continuum emission was self calibrated in casa to further improve the dynamical range in the maps .",
    "the gain solutions from the self calibration were applied to the spectral line data .",
    "we found that the improvement in dynamical range in the continuum is about 20% .",
    "the continuum image reaches a @xmath2 rms noise of 0.075 mjy in a synthesized beam of @xmath20 .",
    "the spectral line sensitivity per 0.7 -1  channel is 2.5 mjy for spw0 , spw1 and spw3 .",
    "the noise in spw2 is a factor of 3 higher for unknown reasons .",
    "thus we exclude the spw2 data for the continuum image .",
    "figure 2 presents the 1.3 mm continuum emission of g28.34 p1 .",
    "the alma image reveals 5 continuum emission peaks along the infrared dark filament .",
    "the peaks of the continuum emission coincide with the 1.3 mm sma continuum sources sma1 through 5 reported by @xcite .",
    "there appears to be another continuum peak @xmath21 southwest of sma5 .",
    "this dust peak is located at 10% of the primary beam response of the alma 12-m antenna . with a primary beam corrected peak flux of 4.8 mjy , it is below the @xmath22 sensitivity limit of the previous sma observations @xcite .",
    "since this feature is at 10% of the primary beam response , clean does not work well .",
    "we refrain from discussion of this feature .",
    "the superior sensitivity of the alma data reveals additional features in the continuum emission .",
    "sma1 , a single continuum source in the 1.3 mm and 0.8 mm sma data @xcite , becomes a group of 4 continuum peaks .",
    "the brightest one coincides with the sma1 position .",
    "the other 3 continuum peaks are at fluxes of 4.0 , 2.0 , 1.9 mjy , respectively . in addition",
    ", spatially extended emission is detected around sma2 , sma3 and sma4 .",
    "although sma5 is a single continuum peak in the sma data , the alma image reveals another continuum peak @xmath23 to the east of sma5 .",
    "overall , alma image reveals fainter and spatially extended emission .",
    "the integrated fluxes in the alma continuum image is 228 mjy , which is about 60% higher than the integrated flux of 143 mjy in the sma 1.3 mm image reported in @xcite .    for convenience of cross referencing , as well as following the convention in the previous papers , we name the 5 groups of sources in the alma continuum image core 1 through core 5 , corresponding to sma1 through sma5 in @xcite , respectively . to identify structures in the 1.3 mm continuum emission",
    ", we employed dendrogram algorithm to decompose the continuum emission .",
    "however , the decomposition misses some obvious emission features .",
    "we then resort to fitting elliptical gaussian to the continuum image , but using the smallest features identified by dendrogram as a starting point of initial guesses for the gaussian fitting .",
    "we identify a total of 38 components in the simultaneous gaussian fit .",
    "the rms in the residual image is @xmath24jy , corresponding to a detection limit of about 0.4 .",

    ", we obtained gas masses of the objects ranging from 0.5 to 16 , assuming a gas - to - dust mass ratio of 100 .",
    "these parameters are also listed in table 1 .",
    "the corresponding h@xmath9 densities in these sources range from @xmath28 to @xmath29 3 .",

    "besides co , the sma observations in the 230 ghz band did not detect line emission at a @xmath15 rms noise of 100 mjy  beam@xmath26 ( at a resolution of @xmath31 and a spectral resolution of 1.3 -1 ) .",
    "the alma observations in the same band reveal line emission from 19 molecular species including 18o , @xmath1cs , 2dp , dcn , h@xmath9s , sio 5 - 4 , 2co , 3oh , and",
    "so , at a level of @xmath32 with a @xmath15 rms noise of 2.5 mjy  beam@xmath26 .",
    "figure 3 presents the line spectra from the spw0 spectral window covering 215.7 through 217.5 ghz toward components 9 and 38 , the brightest continuum peaks in core 2 and core 5 ( see table 1 ) , respectively .",
    "the fluxes are corrected for the alma primary beam attenuation for direct comparison . despite the fact that the two cores have a similar flux in dust continuum , the molecular line emission from the two are very different .",
    "the line emission from core 5 is much fainter than from core 2 .",
    "of particular note is that the emission from 18o and so is nearly non detected in core 5 . a lack of 18o",
    "emission is consistent with co depletion in cold and dense environments at the very early stage of evolution as suggested in @xcite .",
    "the fact that we do not detect so in core 5 may be related to a lack of injection of ice mantles in the gas phase by thermal desorption , i.e. , by an increase of temperature of dust in this core .",
    "the chemistry of so is initiated by the injection of h@xmath9s from mantles .",
    "h@xmath9s is destroyed by h and h@xmath14o@xmath33 to form s and h@xmath14s@xmath33 , which then react with o and oh to form so @xcite .",
    "a lack of so emission in core 5 indicates that the protostar(s ) embedded are at an even earlier stage of evolution than those in core 2 .",
    "figure 4 presents the integrated emission of 18o , @xmath1cs , 2dp , and h@xmath9s lines .",
    "the line emission of these molecules is detected mostly near the dust cores . the 18o emission is strongly detected toward core 1 through core 4 .",
    "there is a faint emission toward core 5 . on the other hand ,",
    "emissions of @xmath1cs and h@xmath9s are seen toward core 2 through core 4 .",
    "the 2dp emission is detected in the dense ridge along the filament .",
    "however , the emission appears to avoid the dust continuum peaks .    besides the above mentioned molecules that mainly trace gas around dense cores , 2co , 3oh and so are also present towards cores 1 through 5 ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "strong emission from 2co , 3oh and so line wings @xmath34 -1 from the cloud systemic velocity is detected outside of dust continuum emission .",
    "their spatial coincidence with the outflows in co 3 - 2 @xcite and 2 - 1 ( see section 3.4 ) indicates their outflow origin .",
    "we will discuss outflows in the region based on the co 2 - 1 and sio 5 - 4 data in section .",
    "cores 2 , 3 and 4 are seen in 18o , @xmath1cs , 2dp , h@xmath9s , 2co , 3oh and so , thus appear to be chemically more active than cores 1 and 5 .      at a much higher sensitivity than the previous high resolution studies of @xcite and @xcite , the 1.3 mm continuum data from alma reveal additional fragments .",
    "core 1 , which is shown as a single dust peak in the sma observations , exhibits three additional condensations .",
    "these structures are likely the outcome of continuing fragmentation upon the formation of cores along the filament .",
    "we investigate the thermodynamical properties from the parsec - scale clump to the condensations ( @xmath5 0.01pc ) .",
    "we measure the size of the clump , cores and condensations using a two dimensional gaussian fit to the dust continuum emission .",
    "the fitting reports the integrated flux and the size of the structure .",
    "we then measure the line width at the same spatial scales .",
    "for the clump , we use the 1.3 mm dust continuum data from the iram 30 m telescope @xcite and the 3 data from the effelsberg 100 m telescope @xcite . for dense cores ,",
    "we use the sma 1.3 mm continuum @xcite , and the 3 data obtained from the vla @xcite . at the scale of condensations , no spectral line emission was detected before the alma observations . in the alma data , a group of molecular lines , e.g. ,",
    "so , 2co and ch@xmath14oh , is affected by protostellar outflows .",
    "emission from 18o , @xmath1cs , 2dp and h@xmath9s is found toward the dust continuum emission .",
    "2dp is in general a reliable tracer of cold and dense gas .",
    "however , its emission is not present toward all condensations , and does not appear to correlate well with the dust continuum peaks . on the other hand , it appears that the 18o emission coincides with the dust continuum emission well .",
    "we measure the line width using the 18o data and found a typical fwhm of 1.7 -1 .",
    "this value is consistent with the line width of 2dp in the vicinity of core 3 , the strongest emission in the map .    from the measurements described above , we compute the gas mass from the dust continuum emission and the virial mass for the clump ( size @xmath5 1 pc ) , cores ( size @xmath6 0.1 pc ) and condensations ( size @xmath6 0.01 pc ) .",
    "the virial mass is computed following @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the radius and @xmath37 is the line - of - sight velocity dispersion , and g the gravitational constant .",
    "@xmath38 is a correction factor dependent on the density profile @xmath39 @xcite . for a constant density , @xmath40 , k= 5/3 ,",
    "the above equation can be rewritten as @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the fwhm of the line width along the line of sight .",
    "table 2 lists gas mass , line width , radius and virial mass of the cloud features identified .",
    "as shown in table 2 , the line width measured from the 3 ( 1,1 ) line decreases from the clump scale of 0.6pc in diameter to 0.05pc in dense cores , and then increases at scales of 0.017pc at which the condensations are identified .",
    "the decrease of line width toward smaller spatial scales in this region is first reported by @xcite when analyzing the 3 line width obtained from the vla .",
    "they found that the 3 line width from the vla alone is systematically smaller than the line width from the 3 spectra from the combined vla and the effelsberg 100 m telescope .",
    "in addition , @xcite found that the 3 line width is inversely correlated with the 3 fluxes .",
    "the authors interpret the change of line width as indications of turbulence dissipation from the clump to core scales .",
    "the alma observations reveal for the first time spectral line information in dust condensations identified with the sma at 880 @xmath3 m and alma at 1.3 mm .",
    "the line width derived from 18o in condensations are consistently larger than the 3 line width in the cores . since star formation has already taken place in these condensations , the line width can be broadened by infall and rotation in the envelope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the 18o line width can also be enhanced due to an increase of turbulence thanks to the injection of energy from protostellar outflows ( see next section ) .",
    "the virial parameter , @xmath43 , defined as @xmath44 , is smaller than 1 in clump , cores as well as condensations for a constant density distribution .",
    "previous observations of g28.34 found a density profile @xmath39 with the power - law index , a=2 @xcite for detected cores .",
    "it is reasonable to assume a similar density profile in condensations . with a power - law index of 2 ,",
    "the virial masses reported in table 2 are reduced by a factor of 5/3 . applying this correction to the @xmath43 values in table 2",
    "leads to @xmath43 much smaller than 1 .",
    "our observations indicate that molecular gas is not in a virial equilibrium from the clump to condensations .",
    "the virial analysis presented above does not include magnetic fields , which can in turn increase the virial mass .",
    "magnetic fields provide additional pressure in the medium .",
    "their contribution to the virial mass for a critical mass - to - flux ratio of gravitational collapse is given by @xmath45 . here",
    "@xmath46 is the contribution to the virial mass from magnetic fields .",
    "there are no direct measurements of magnetic fields in g28.34 cores .",
    "however , recently studies of dust polarization in regions harboring high - mass protostellar objects found that magnetic fields play an important role in the fragmentation of molecular clumps @xcite .",
    "detailed analysis reports the plane - of - sky component of magnetic fields of order of 1 - 10 mg @xcite , which can increase the virial mass significantly ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite reported a magnetic field strength of 0.27 mg in an irdc clump g11.11 using the dust polarization data from jcmt . assuming the same magnetic field flux in the g28.34 p1 clump , we find the mass for a critical mass - to - flux ratio of @xmath47 .",
    "the virial parameter including the effect of magnetic fields becomes 2 in the clump .",
    "we can not evaluate virial parameters for the cores detected here since there is no direct estimate of magnetic fields in irdc cores .",
    "however , for the sake of argument we assume a magnetic field of 0.27 mg , the same as that reported for irdc g11.11 , the virial parameters derived for cores detected here are still smaller than unity . we therefore suggest , a field strength of 2 mg - 5 mg would be required to make virial parameters close to 1 for these cores .",
    "molecular outflows are detected using several tracers including co , sio , 2co , 3oh , and so .",
    "figure 5 presents co 2 - 1 and sio 5 - 4 emission in outflows .",
    "as shown in figure 5 , high velocity line emission is detected around cores 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 .",
    "there appears to be more than one outflow originating from cores 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 , consistent with the presence of multiple protostars indicated by multiple continuum peaks .",
    "we identify outflow pairs by inspecting the channel maps of the co , sio , 2co , 3oh , and so emission .",
    "a total of 10 outflows are identified in the region . of them ,",
    "three outflows ( outflows 3a , 3b and 4c ) were not seen in the previous study by @xcite .",
    "table 3 lists the tracers through which they are identified .",
    "the co emission is the most effective tracer for most outflows .",
    "however , outflows 1a and 4b exhibit much stronger emission in sio , 3oh and 2co emission .",
    "sio and 3oh are heavily depleted with low abundances ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively ) in cold and dense regions @xcite .",
    "their abundances are significantly enhanced in protostellar outflows due to shocks triggered by the interaction between protostellar wind and the ambient medium , and release the si and 3oh molecule off the dust grain .",
    "the enhanced sio and 3oh are seen in both low - mass and high - mass protostellar outflows ( e.g. l1157 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    some of the outflows in the region display remarkable collimation .",
    "in particular , outflow 2a associated with core 2 extends more than 40@xmath19 , or 1 pc in the sky . the full extent is not known since it is beyond the fwhm of the primary beam of the alma 12 m antenna .",
    "the width of the co outflow is 1@xmath19.1 , yielding a collimation factor , defined as the ratio between the major and the minor axis , of more than 35 .",
    "this outflow , reaching a velocity @xmath50 50 - 1  from the cloud velocity , also has a wide angle component seen in the co v@xmath51 velocities of 90 - 92 -1 .",
    "the component has an opening angle of 10@xmath52 .",
    "the outflow consists of a chain of co knots appearing symmetrically with respect to the outflow origin , which is also seen in the co 3 - 2 emission with the sma @xcite .",
    "the projected spacing of the co knots are @xmath53 , or @xmath54 au .",
    "these knots likely correspond to an increase in mass ejection related to episodic accretion , as reported in both low - mass and high - mass protostars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . assuming a jet velocity of 100 to 500 -1 , the time scale associated with the episodic ejection is @xmath55 to @xmath12 years .",

    "the embedded protostars continue to accrete material from their respective surrounding environment .",
    "this picture is similar to the competitive accretion model in that cores do not acquire all their mass before the birth of a protostar , but continue to gain mass during the protostellar accretion .",
    "however , massive cores contain super jeans mass , unlike what is assumed in the competitive accretion model , but it is close to the turbulent core model .",
    "in the meantime , massive cores appear to fragment and form a group of stars , in contrast with the picture of monolithic collapse .",
    "the 3 temperature measured in these cores are typically @xmath69 k , indicating that protostellar heating is ineffective in suppressing fragmentation in the core ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "the 3 data from the vla observations @xcite demonstrate that despite turbulence decay , the line widths measured at @xmath70 scales appear to be large enough to support the cores in g28.34 p1 .",
    "once the protostars are formed , outflows inject energy in to the immediate surrounding of protostars , and increase the line width as seen in the 18o line width .",
    "this feedback provides additional support that may stop further fragmentation in the gas at the early stage of a cluster formation @xcite .",
    "one of the key assumptions in the monolithic collapse model is that cluster forming clumps are approximately in hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "this is based on the observational fact that the time scale for star formation is typically several dynamical times ( the free - fall time scale of the gas ) .",
    "the virial analysis of the g28.34 p1 clump and cores and condensations within the core reveals that these entities are far from a virial equilibrium .",
    "the virial parameter , defined as @xmath44 , is less than 0.47 from the clump to cores and condensations ( see table 2 ) .",

    "similar findings of sub - viral parameters are also reported recently @xcite .",
    "however , a key component that is not accounted for in the virial analysis is magnetic fields .",
    "a moderate field of 0.5 mg or larger can bring the virial parameter to closer to 1 .",

    "while the comparison of physical properties between g28.34 p1 and p2 places p1 at an evolutionary stage prior to the presence of a massive protostar , the spectral line data from alma further constrains the evolutionary stage of p1 .",

    "while the spatially extended emission seen in the alma data can give rise to a population of low - mass protostars in the vicinity of massive stars , a lack of low - mass protostellar cores outside of dense ridge in the p1 region is intriguing .",
    "the absence of a distributed population of low - mass protostellar cores in the clump suggests several possibilities about low - mass star formation in a cluster environment : ( 1 ) low - mass stars only form in the immediate neighborhood of massive stars ; ( 2 ) the distributed low - mass population does not form in situ , but instead forms outside of the clump , and follows the global collapse and moves to the center of the cluster ; and ( 3 ) the distributed low - mass protostellar cores have not formed yet in g28.34 .",

    "the parsec - scale velocity field derived from the 3 ( 1,1 ) line appears to be consistent with gas flowing toward the center of the cluster .",
    "the velocity of the flow , without correcting for the projection effect is @xmath84 -1 .",
    "if the inflowing gas and protostars move at 0.5 -1 , it takes about @xmath28 yrs for the low - mass protostars to travel 0.5pc to the central area of the cluster . while we can not rule out that this process may contribute to the formation of distributed low - mass stars in clusters , its effectiveness in the g28.34 clump is questionable .",
    "in particular , within a 2pc area of p1 , the higher density gas is mostly distributed within the clump .",
    "it becomes counter intuitive that the lower density gas outside of the p1 clump would form stars while the higher density gas within the clump does not .",

    "a lack of detection of low - mass cores suggests that in clustered star formation , low - mass cores and stars form at a later stage , after the formation of massive stars .",
    "there have been discussions regarding when low - mass stars form relative to massive stars in a cluster @xcite .",
    "since massive protostars evolve in a relatively short dynamical time scale of @xmath86 yrs , their strong feedback through radiation and ionization may halt the growth of low - mass stars . with this consideration",
