    "the integration in @xmath5 and the limit @xmath0 does not commute in general .    in the process of these calculations it has been pointed out that the emergence of a non - vanishing contribution from pair production by the interacting photon is naturally achieved by extending the region of allowed quanta solutions in the light - front , that is , extending the fock space of positive quanta to include relevant solutions from the fock space of negative quanta .",
    "it also means that the myth of light front trivial vacuum must be forever abandoned .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the inclusion of the pair production term in the light front formalism is of capital importance for the validity of rotational symmetry for the electromagnetic current of a bound state of two bosons in the model of a constant vertex @xcite . in the case of components @xmath6 and @xmath123 we concluded that the pair creation term does not contribute in the limit @xmath124 . for the @xmath12 component , however , we have shown that we must take into account the pair production so that rotational symmetry be satisfied in the limit @xmath0 .",
