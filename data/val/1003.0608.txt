    "we used a 60 cm cassegrain telescope equipped with an emi  9558b photomultiplier ( 1991    1999 ) , a rca  c31034 photomultiplier ( 2001    2004 ) and ccd camera ( 2005  -  2008 ) , to obtain the @xmath0 photometry of the selectd symbiotic stars ( for details see * ? ? ? * ) . for tx cvn and ag peg we used additional data from the slovak long - term monitoring programme of photometric observations of selected symbiotic stars ( * ? ? ?",

    "the @xmath1 light curves phased with the double period ( 437.18  days ) are demonstrated .",
    "we have used wilson    devinney s code @xcite to verify the assumption , that the double sine wave could be interpret as an ellipsoidal effect connected with the tidal distortion of the giant surface . a circular orbit ( @xmath2 ) with inclination @xmath3 was adopted .",
