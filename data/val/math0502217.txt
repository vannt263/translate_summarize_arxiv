    "nowadays time - frequency analysis is a well - developed field with many applications in signal analysis and wireless communication @xcite .",
    "the modulation spaces intruduced by feichtinger in the early 80 s @xcite play a fundamental role in this mathematical area @xcite .",
    "the basic operators in time - frequency analysis on @xmath6 are the translation @xmath7 and the modulation @xmath8 . for a fixed window function",
    "@xmath9 the short time fourier transform ( stft ) is given by @xmath10 .",
    "it is well - known that for a suitable choice of constants @xmath11 and of @xmath9 the family @xmath12 forms a frame - a so called gabor frame . in other words ,",
    "the stft admits discretizations .",
    "in particular , we can write an arbitrary @xmath1-function as @xmath13 . furthermore , expansions of this type extend to modulation spaces @xcite .    in @xcite we considered radial functions , or more generally functions which are invariant under the action of some subgroup of @xmath14 , and raised the question whether it is possible to develop an adapted time - frequency analysis for such functions .",
    "of course , one can apply all results that are valid for functions on @xmath6 .",
    "however , it seems natural that the additional information that the function under consideration is radial should allow one to gain some advantages .",
    "when starting investigations in this direction one immediately observes that the operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 do not preserve radiality except for trivial cases .",
    "so the natural requirement is to replace these operators by some that preserve radiality .",
    "in @xcite we found a natural candidate for such operators in the more general context of square - integrable group representations .",
    "in particular , we developed the hilbert space theory for the abstract continuous transform and applied it to the special case of the short time fourier transform ( stft ) of radial functions .",
    "in @xcite we treated the corresponding discrete theory which lead to the construction of discrete ( banach ) frames for spaces of invariant vectors ( functions ) . to do this",
    "we generalized the well - established coorbit space theory originally developed by feichtinger and grchenig @xcite .",
    "this discretization method does not only work on the hilbert space level ( i.e. , for @xmath1 ) but also for more general banach spaces , so - called coorbit spaces of invariant vectors , see section [ sec_notation ] . in the special case of time - frequency analysis",
    "they are precisely the modulation spaces .",
    "we remark that coorbit space theory was further generalized to the setting of an abstract continuous frame in @xcite",
    ".    in @xcite we did not give examples .",
    "so in this paper we show in detail how to apply the general results in order to obtain radial gabor frames and atomic decompositions for radial modulation spaces explicitly . in order to study the quality of approximation with radial gabor frames",
    "we compare it to the one with usual gabor frames .",
    "in particular , we investigate linear and non - linear approximation .",
    "we first derive results in the general context of coorbit spaces and apply them to approximation in radial modulation spaces later on . to some extent it turns out that the radial gabor frames really perform better than the usual gabor frames when approximating a radial function .",
    "this provides a further justification of the original motivation to consider an adapted analysis for radial functions .",
    "moreover , we present how embeddings of coorbit spaces of invariant elements can be studied by means of embeddings of certain sequence spaces .",
    "this result generalizes the work of feichtinger and grchenig in @xcite .",
    "the general embedding theorem indicates that restricting coorbit spaces to invariant vectors ( functions ) may enforce certain embeddings of coorbit spaces to become compact . in the case of the besov and triebel - lizorkin spaces",
    "this phenomenon was observed earlier by skrzypczak et al . in @xcite .",
    "we apply these results to derive new embedding results for subspaces of modulation spaces consisting of radial functions .",
    "moreover , we determine the entropy numbers of certain embeddings of radial modulation spaces . as special case it turns out that the feichtinger algebra @xmath2 restricted to radial functions",
    "is embedded into the sobolev space @xmath3 .",
    "this is rather surprising because @xmath17 ( not restricted to radial functions ) is not a subspace of @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath4 the embedding @xmath19 is compact if and only if @xmath20 . in particular , @xmath21 is compactly embedded into @xmath0 for @xmath4 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the necessary notation and background information .",
    "moreover , we prove the general results about embeddings of abstract coorbit spaces .",
    "also we provide statements about linear and non - linear approximation .",
    "in section 3 we apply the general theory to time - frequency analysis of radial functions in @xmath6 .",
    "we explicitly construct the radial gabor frames and state results about linear and non - linear approximation with these .",
    "moreover , we prove the mentioned embedding theorems for subspaces of modulation spaces consisting of radial functions ( distributions ) .",
    "as announced we will derive our results first in the abstract setting of coorbit spaces and then apply it to modulation spaces of radial functions . to this end",
    "we need to introduce some notation from @xcite .",
    "let @xmath22 be a locally compact group and @xmath23 be a compact automorphism group of @xmath22 , such that @xmath23 acts continuously on @xmath22 , i.e. , the mapping @xmath24 is continuous .",
    "we denote the left haar measures on @xmath22 and @xmath23 by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath26 is assumed to be normalized .",
    "however , we usually write @xmath27 and @xmath28 in integrals .",
    "the modular function on @xmath22 is denoted by @xmath29 and the left and right translation operators on @xmath22 by @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , we define two involutions by @xmath32 and @xmath33 . the action of @xmath23 on functions on @xmath22 is denoted by @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and the action on measures @xmath36 , the space of complex bounded radon measures on @xmath22 ( the dual space of @xmath37 ) , by @xmath38 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath39 .",
    "the functions ( measures ) which satisfy @xmath40 for all @xmath35 are called invariant ( under @xmath23 ) .",
    "a standard argument shows that the haar - measure @xmath25 and the modular function @xmath29 are invariant under any compact automorphism group @xcite . for a function ( measure )",
    "space @xmath41 on @xmath22 we denote its subspace of invariant elements by @xmath42 .",
    "an invariant function on @xmath22 can be interpreted as a function on @xmath43 the space of all orbits of the form @xmath44 .",

    "for some positive measurable weight function @xmath46 on @xmath22 we define the weighted space @xmath47 with norm @xmath48 where the @xmath49-spaces on @xmath22 are defined as usual .    in this paper we will work with banach spaces of functions on @xmath22 which will usually be denoted by @xmath41 .",
    "similarly as in @xcite we will make the following assumptions on @xmath41 .    1 .",
    "@xmath41 is continuously embedded into @xmath50 , the locally integrable functions on @xmath22 .",

    "then @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "we may hence define the two functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "clearly , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , i.e. , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are submultiplicative .",
    "additionally , we require that @xmath59 and @xmath60 are continuous . under these assumptions it holds ,",
    "see @xcite @xmath61 4 .",
    "@xmath23 acts continuously on @xmath41 . without loss of generality",
    "we may then even assume that @xmath23 acts isometrically on @xmath41 implying @xmath62 and @xmath63 for all @xmath64 .",
    "( in case this is not true define an invariant norm on @xmath41 by @xmath65 .",
    "since @xmath23 acts continuously on @xmath41 this is an equivalent norm on @xmath41 . )",

    "then @xmath652    this follows from theorem [ thm_nonlinapprox ] in connection with theorem [ thm_embed_mod ] .",
    "we remark that in the corresponding result for approximating with usual gabor frames the condition on @xmath653 would be @xmath654 .",

    "thus , the class @xmath571 for which ( [ nonlin_radgab ] ) is guaranteed to hold for a certain @xmath656 is larger than the one for approximating an invariant @xmath404 with usual gabor frames .",
