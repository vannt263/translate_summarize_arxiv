    "the interaction of atoms and/or nanoparticles with an interface or a cavity is a research topic which has attracted a lot of attention in the past and which is still a vital field of research .",
    "such interactions include for example the change of the radiative life time or purcell effect  @xcite close to an interface or in a cavity , the energy transfer between a nanoparticle and a surface  @xcite or between two anisotropic nanoparticles  @xcite , the radiative cooling rate of nanoparticles in close vicinity to a plasmonic system  @xcite , the frster resonance energy transfer in the presence of an interface  @xcite , the spin - hall effect close to plasmonic systems  @xcite as well as the casimir - polder ( cp ) force  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the possibility to use materials with special properties as graphene , for instance , has renewed the interest in such studies .",
    "so it was shown that graphene allows for controlling the spontaneous emission or local density of states  @xcite and can enhance the radiative heat transfer between two materials  @xcite as well as the frster energy transfer between two atoms in close vicinity of a sheet of graphene  @xcite . due to the possibility of changing the electron density of graphene by gating or doping  @xcite the magnitude of these effects",
    "can be controlled to a certain extent .",
    "regarding the casimir force between two or several sheets of graphene  @xcite , a sheet of graphene and a metal  @xcite it turns out that it is on the order of some percent of the casimir force between two perfect metals  @xcite .",
    "similar results were found for the cp force between a rubidium atom and a graphene layer in ref .",
    "@xcite reporting a value for the cp force of about five percent of that for an ideal metal .",
    "in addition , it could be shown that the effect of gating or doping has only small influence on the casimir force for gapless graphene  @xcite .",
    "finally , it could be shown that by applying external magnetic fields the casimir force between two graphene layers can be completely suppressed or even made repulsive due to the quantum hall effect  @xcite which might be useful in the search for yukawa - like corrections to newtonian gravity  @xcite .",
    "the values obtained for the casimir force between two or several sheets of graphene or graphene and a metal which are only some percent of that for perfect metals seem to be rather small values .",
    "however , for a single - atomic layer such as graphene this magnitude of the casimir force is astonishingly large and can be explained by the unique properties of graphene .",
    "but as we show in the following even much higher values can be obtained for the cp force between a spheroidal nanoparticle and a sheet of graphene as sketched in fig .",
    "[ sketch ] .",
    "it turns out that in the high - temperature limit , i.e.  for distances larger than the thermal wavelength @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is about @xmath2 at @xmath3 ) , the sheet of graphene essentially acts like a perfect metal regardless of the shape and orientation of the particle as was also previously found for atoms above a sheet of graphene  @xcite . on the other hand , for distances smaller than the thermal wavelength",
    "such a large cp force persists .",
    "due to the effect of tuning in graphene and the particle s anisotropy it can still be as large as 20 - 50% of that between a nanoparticle and a perfect metal .",
    "compared to the results previously found for the casimir force these values are extremely large .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we derive the general expressions for the cp energy and force between an anisotropic nanoparticle and a halfspace or a graphene - covered halfspace . in sec .",
    "iii we introduce the models describing the material properties of gold and graphene which are used in the numerical simulations . then in sec .",
    "iv and v we discuss numerical results for the cp force between isotropic and spheroidal nanoparticles and a sheet of graphene .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in sec .  vi .",
    "in this section we derive the expression for the cp energy as well as for the cp potential of an in general anisotropic nanoparticle and an interface .      following the procedure in ref .",

    "the results are independent of the radius of the nanoparticles , but it has to be kept in mind that the presented results are only meaningful for distances @xmath17 larger than the radius of the nanoparticle . in addition , by using the expressions ( [ eq : clausiusmosotti ] ) and ( [ eq : polellipsoidal ] ) for the polarizability it is assumed for convenience that the nanoparticle is smaller than the skin depth .",

    "this is due to the fact that for small frequencies ( i.e.  large distances ) the drude term in the conductivity of graphene dominates .",
    "this result has to be taken with some care , since the used model is strictly valid only for frequencies larger than @xmath84  @xcite .",

    "the cp force is relatively small compared to the ideal metal case .",
    "the minimal values found are about 7% of the ideal metal case . by increasing the fermi level the force on the particle can be increased . at @xmath88",
    "one can increase the relative force from about 7% to 12% .",
    "hence , the cp force between a spherical nanoparticle and a sheet of graphene as well as the effect of tuning is relatively small .",
    "these observations are similar to the results found for the casimir - lifshitz force between a gold halfspace and a sheet of graphene  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : auimau ] we also show the results for the force between a gold nanoparticle above a sheet of graphene normalized to the case where graphene is replaced by a gold halfspace .",
    "the qualitative behaviour remains the same but the relative values change slightly .      to analyze the influence of the shape of the particle on the cp force we consider now a spheroidal nanoparticle close to a suspended sheet of graphene . to start with ,",
    "we study the cp force between a spheroidal gold nanoparticle and a sheet of graphene as function of the aspect ratios @xmath89 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : spheroidalauim ] the exact cp force variation depends on the distance and the orientation of the nanoparticle as well as the fermi level of the graphene sheet . for @xmath88 we find that with respect to the spherical particle the force for an oblate nanoparticle ( @xmath90 ) increases if the rotational axis is oriented parallel to the graphene sheet ( @xmath91 orientation ) and first decreases when the nanoparticle becomes slightly prolate ( @xmath92 ) before it increases rapidly for strongly prolate particles .",
    "for the nanoparticle with the rotational axis normal to the graphene sheet ( @xmath93 orientation ) a similar trend can be seen , but the minimum in the force ratio @xmath94 is less pronounced and shifted to larger aspect ratios @xmath89 .",
    "similar trends for both orientations are found for @xmath95 but here the cp force for the particle with the rotational axis normal to the surface seems to decrease monotonically with the aspect ratio @xmath89 in the plotted region .",
    "hence , the shape and orientation of the nanoparticle has a strong influence on the force excerted on that particle .",
    "note that this effect can even be more important than the effect of tuning by changing the fermi level in graphene .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : spheroidalauimdist ] we show some results of the cp force between a prolate ( @xmath96 ) , oblate ( @xmath97 ) , and spherical au nanoparticle ( @xmath98 ) and a sheet of graphene ( here we use @xmath99 ) as a function of distance .",
    "it can be seen that for distances on the order of 100 nm or smaller the force on the nonspherical particles is generally larger than on the spherical ones having the same volume . for larger distances",
    "the force of the spheroidal particles compared to the spherical particles is always larger when the particle axis with larger @xmath100 or @xmath101 is normal to the graphene sheet . on the other hand , if this particle axis with larger @xmath100 or @xmath101 is parallel to the graphene sheet , the resulting force is smaller than for a particle of spherical shape .",
    "as observered for sperical particles the cp force converges in all cases to the ideal metal result for @xmath102 .",
    "hence , for such distances graphene acts like a perfect metal regardless of the shape and orientation of the nanoparticle .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : spheroidalauimdist ] we also show the results obtained by using nonlocal model for the conductivity of graphene .",

    "@xcite and are summarized in the appendix a for convenience .",
    "the nonlocal results are marked with dots , crosses etc .  and show only small eviations from the local expressions for small distances which justifies the neglect of nonlocal effects in our work .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : spheroidalauimdistef1 ] we show the results for the same configuration as in fig .",
    "[ fig : spheroidalauimdist ] but for graphene with a fermi level of @xmath103 . in this case , the cp force between spheroidal nanoparticles and graphene is much larger than between spherical particles and graphene for distances smaller than 100 nm so that even values between 20 - 50% of that between a nanoparticle and a perfect metal can be achieved which is huge compared to the values of about 5% or less found in refs .",
    "@xcite and it is large compared to the value found for the spheroidal nanoparticle which is between 11 - 18% in fig .",
    "[ fig : spheroidalauimdistef1 ] of the ideal metal case .",
    "in summary , we have considered the thermal casimir - polder interaction between spherical / spheroidal nanoparticles and a sheet of graphene .",
    "we have shown that the casimir - polder force for spherical particles is in general small compared to the force between the nanoparticle and a perfect metal when considering distances much smaller than the thermal wavelength .",
    "on the other hand , for distances larger than the thermal wavelength the sheet of graphene behaves like a perfect metal a result which was also found previously for atoms above graphene .",
    "tuning the electron density inside the sheet of graphene by gating or doping seems to have a relatively small impact on the resulting force .",
    "however , when considering spheroidal nanoparticles it turns out that the shape and orientation can have an impact on the resulting force which is larger than that of the tuning inside graphene . depending on the distance regime the force between spheroidal nanoparticles and graphene can be larger or smaller than that for spherical nanoparticles having the same volume .",
    "for distances smaller then @xmath82 we find that the force excerted on spheroidal nanoparticles is always larger than that for spherical nanoparticles with the same volume .",
    "the effect of anisotropy and tuning together result in a force between the spheroidal nanoparticles and graphene which can be in the range of 20 - 50% of that between spheroidal nanoparticles and a perfect metal .",
    "this is quite large compared to the casimir force found between a gold halfspace and a sheet of graphene , between a rubidium atom and graphene , and between a spherical gold nanoparticle and graphene which are about 3% , 5% or between 11 - 18% of that for perfect metals .",

    "<S> we derive the analytical expressions for the thermal casimir - polder energy and force between a spheroidal nanoparticle above a semi - infinite material and a graphene covered interface . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze in detail the casimir - polder force between a gold nanoparticle and a single sheet of pristine graphene focusing on the impact of anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the effect of anisotropy , i.e.  the shape and orientation of the spheroidal nanoparticle , has a much larger influence on the force than the tunability of graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of tuning and anisotropy both add up such that we observe a force between the particle and the sheet of graphene which is between 20 - 50% of that between the same particle and an ideal metal plate . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the observed force is much larger than the results found for the casimir force between a metal halfspace and a layer of graphene . </S>"
