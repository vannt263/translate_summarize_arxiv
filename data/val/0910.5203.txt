    "the study of the properties of jets and the underlying event in _",
    "p - p_collisions is important for improving our understanding of qcd and the hadronization process , as well as providing a vital baseline for comparison to measurements being performed at rhic by the star and phenix collaborations in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "the results presented here are a preliminary study of _ p - p_collisions at @xmath0= 200 gev by the star collaboration .",
    "it has previously been shown  @xcite that the inclusive jet cross - section in _",
    "p - p_collisions at @xmath0= 200 gev is well described over seven orders of magnitude by nlo pqcd calculations .",
    "further , these theoretical calculations can also successfully describe the @xmath1 and ( anti)proton production in minimum bias collisions at the same collision energy  @xcite .",
    "these results indicate that we have a well calibrated probe .",
    "however , the fragmentation functions , jet shapes , particle composition of the hadronized fragments and the underlying event all remain unexplored at rhic energies .",
    "such studies are now underway and a few selected preliminary results are presented below .",
    "calculations suggest that the identified particle fragmentation functions are modified in different ways by the presence of a quark gluon plasma  @xcite , this makes it especially important to have a well measured baseline with which to compare to the measurements in au - au collisions .",
    "these data are also compared to predictions of pythia 6.410  @xcite , tuned to the cdf 1.8 - 1.96 tev data ( tune a ) .",
    "this tuning has been shown to give good agreement with most of the measurements made at the tevatron  @xcite",
    ". an important test of whether such a tuning is truly representative of the underlying physics in elementary collisions , or merely a diligent selection of numerous parameters , is to compare pythia predictions at a different collision energy without changing the parameters except via the estimated energy scaling . a cartoon of many of the major components included in pythia s modeling of an elementary collision is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ppcollision ] .",
    "one such important energy scaling parameter in pythia is the hard scattering cut - off of multiple parton interactions ( mpi ) in the collision .",
    "this cut - off is placed at p@xmath2(e@xmath3 ) = p@xmath2(e@xmath3/e@xmath4)@xmath5 , where e@xmath4 is 1.8 - 1.96 tev , the tuning collision energy .",
    "the initial estimate of @xmath6= 0.16 has been widely used in lhc predictions , however improved data at @xmath0= 1.8 - 1.96 tev and newer data at @xmath0= 630 gev now suggest that a value of @xmath6= 0.25 is more appropriate  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of multiple parton interactions increases the activity , and hence particle production , in the underlying event .",
    "increasing @xmath6 creates a larger energy dependence of the multiple parton interactions . a change in pythia of @xmath6 from 0.16 to 0.25 results in a 35@xmath7 increase in the charged particle density in the underlying event at rhic energies , while decreasing the particle density at the lhc by 26@xmath7 .",
    "it is therefore important to determine the correct scaling parameter in order to have accurate predictions for the lhc when it begins collisions later this year .",
    "we utilize data from the mid - rapidity time projection chamber ( tpc ) to reconstruct charged particles , and the mid - rapidity barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( bemc ) to measure the neutral particle production .",
    "a `` jet patch '' trigger requiring e@xmath88 gev in a @xmath9 x @xmath10 = 1x1 patch of the bemc was used to collect the data . during the rhic run-6 in 2006 the use of this trigger allowed star to sample a luminosity of @xmath118.7 pb@xmath12 . by requiring such a large signal in the bemc",
    "a neutral energy fragmentation bias is created for the triggering jet .",
    "charged particle fragmentation functions are therefore presented only for the di - jet partner not associated with the triggered jet - patch .",
    "the k@xmath13 and anti - k@xmath13 and siscone jet algorithms from the fastjet package  @xcite were used to reconstruct jets , all three algorithms combine particles in @xmath14 space and are infrared and collinear safe .",
    "siscone , a seedless cone algorithm , merges particles within a cone radius r=@xmath15 .",
    "a process of splitting and merging of cones is then performed to improve on the effectiveness of the cone algorithm in collecting energy radiated off of the scattered parton via higher - order qcd processes .",
    "the k@xmath13 and anti - k@xmath13 jet finders are sequential recombination algorithms .",
    "such algorithms successively cluster in a pair - wise fashion , all particles and proto - jets ( previously merged particle pairs ) in the event via a @xmath16and distance weighted cut selection until no cluster pairs pass the cut .",
    "all remaining clusters are designated jets . for the k@xmath13 algorithm",
    "the selection starts from the lowest d@xmath17 particle / cluster pair , where @xmath18 , r is the resolution parameter and k@xmath13 = = @xmath16 . if this minimum distance @xmath19 , the pair are merged , and the iteration over all the new d@xmath17 continues until the test fails .",
    "the anti - k@xmath13 algorithm is similar except it merges from the highest d@xmath17 and selects for @xmath20 . in this way",
    "the anti - k@xmath13 algorithm behaves much like an idealized cone algorithm .",
    "a cut of @xmath21@xmath220.2 gev / c was applied to all charged particles considered in the event , and @xmath23@xmath220.2 gev for each tower cluster reconstructed in the bemc . to investigate how the radius / resolution parameters , r , used in this study affect the reconstructed jet energy , the siscone algorithm was first run with r=1 .",
    "the energy contained within this jet cone as a function of r was then studied , fig .",

    "the data are not yet corrected to the particle level , therefore the results are compared to pythia 6.410 calculations passed through star s detector simulation and reconstruction algorithms .",
    "the single charged particle reconstruction efficiency in the tpc is @xmath22 80@xmath7 for @xmath16@xmath221 gev / c .",
    "such detector inefficiencies and the presence of particles which are undetected by the star detector , such as the neutron and k@xmath26 , cause the reconstructed jet @xmath16to be lower on average than the true value",
    ". the errors shown in all plots are therefore statistical only at this point .",
    "the jet energy resolution was obtained via two techniques .",
    "the first uses the pythia simulations to compare reconstructed jet energies at the particle and detector level .",
    "the second studies the energy balance of  back - to - back \" di - jets in the real _ p - p_data .",

    "the underlying event is defined as everything but the hard scattering .",

    "[ fig : ppcollision ] .",
    "pile - up ( multiple events being recorded as one by the experiment ) is not considered to be part of the underlying event .",
    "this study is performed at mid - rapidity , hence the beam - beam contribution is minimal .",
    "we follow the cdf technique  @xcite to perform this study .",
    "briefly , the method follows the following steps : first the jets in an event are reconstructed , using the algorithms mentioned above .",
    "next , the event is split into four sections defined by their azimuthal angle with respect to the leading jet axis ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the range within @xmath33@xmath3060@xmath34 is the lead jet region .",
    "an away jet area is designated for @xmath33@xmath22120@xmath34 .",
    "this leaves two remaining transverse sectors of @xmath35@xmath30@xmath32@xmath30120@xmath34 and @xmath36@xmath30@xmath32@xmath30 - 60@xmath34 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : uefig ] .",
    "the transverse region containing the largest charged particle multiplicity is assigned the transmax region , the other transverse sector is termed the transmin region . the probability of the transmax region containing contributions from initial and final state radiation components of the hard scattered parton is enhanced via this selection criteria .",
    "leading \" jet study , where at least one jet is found in star s acceptance , and a  back - to - back \" jet study , which is a sub - set of the  leading `` jet collection are performed .",
    "this ' ' back - to - back \" sub - set of events has two ( and only two ) found jets with @xmath37@xmath220.7 and @xmath38@xmath22150@xmath34 .",
    "this selection suppresses the probability that the scattered parton undergoes any significant hard initial and final state radiation .",
    "thus , by comparing the transmax and transmin regions in the  leading \" and  back - to - back \" sets we can alter the sensitivity of the data to the various components in the underlying event .    , relative to the leading jet , used to define the near jet , away jet , transmin and transmax regions for the underlying event analysis . figure taken from  @xcite . ]    , using k@xmath13 algorithm , r=0.7 .",

    "figure  [ fig : uentracks ] shows the uncorrected charged particle densities of the away jet , transmin and transmax regions of the  back - to - back \" data set using the k@xmath13 algorithm , r=0.7 .",
    "the first observation is that the underlying is largely independent of the jet energy while the away jet particle density steadily rises with reconstructed jet @xmath16 , as expected .",
    "figure  [ fig : uept ] shows the uncorrected mean @xmath16of these regions .",
    "again the underlying event results are essentially independent of the hard scattering energy",
    ". the data for the underlying event at rhic energies are slightly lower than those observed for the underlying event at cdf  @xcite .",
    "the results are consistent within errors for the siscone , k@xmath13 , and anti - k@xmath13 algorithms . in both figures",
    "the green dashed histogram is the prediction from pythia .",
    "this pythia tuning gets the trends of the data essentially correct , but slightly under predicts the particle multiplicity and mean @xmath16 in the transverse regions , while over predicting the activity within the jet . in this tuning , as stated above , the multiple parton scattering energy scaling factor , @xmath6 , is set to 0.25 .",
    "the data is still slightly above pythia supporting the evidence that a large value of the energy dependence parameter , @xmath6 , is needed than that initially determined of @xmath6=0.16 .",
    "this also suggests that a number of the lhc predictions , often labeled as  atlas \" tunes , are _ over _ predicting the activity in the underlying event at 14 tev .    , using siscone algorithm , r=0.7 . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : uezoom ] shows the measured charged particle density in the underlying event .",
    "the densities are the same within errors for the  leading \" and  back - to - back \" datasets .",
    "this measurement , like those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffz04]-[fig : ffxi07 ] , can be used to argue that the hard scattered partons emit very small amounts of large angle initial / final state radiation at rhic energies .",
    "this is very different in 1.96 tev collisions where the  leading\"/back - to - back \" density ratio is @xmath110.65  @xcite .",
    "the two solid lines show the expected density if events follow a poisson distribution with an average of 0.36 .",
    "the similarity of this simple simulation to the data suggests that at rhic energies the splitting of the measured transmax and transmin values is predominantly due to the sampling .",
    "pythia results , not shown here , again display satisfactory agreement with the data for both data sets .",
    "in summary , jet fragmentation functions have been measured in _",
    "p - p_collisions at @xmath0= 200 gev and will provide a stringent baseline for the measurements underway in au - au collisions .",
    "the three jet algorithms studied , siscone , k@xmath13 and anti - k@xmath13 provide consistent results .",
    "pythia , tuned to 1.8 - 1.96 tev data , shows reasonable agreement suggesting that the the underlying physics and its energy dependence is well modeled .    the underlying event is largely decoupled from magnitude of the momentum transfer of hard scattering .",
    "the data show there is virtually no large angle initial and final state radiation from the hard scattering at rhic energies .",
    "the collision energy dependence of the multiple parton interactions in the event is more significant than initially estimated .",
    "this results in a smaller prediction for the magnitude of the underlying event contribution to the background of the reconstructed jets at lhc energies . at rhic the @xmath16spectra of particles in the underlying event",
    "are significantly softer than those from jets .    in the future",
    "these data will be corrected for detector inefficiencies and irresolution allowing for comparison to theoretical models at the particle level .",
    "the structure of the jet shapes ( k@xmath13 , j@xmath13 etc ) will be studied , as will the particle type composition of the jets and the underlying event . ultimately all these results will be compared to similar measurements made in heavy - ion collisions at the same beam energy .",
