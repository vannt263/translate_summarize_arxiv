    "lsb galaxies have diffuse stellar disks , large hi gas disks and low metallicities ( impey & bothun 1997 ) .",
    "although rich in gas they are poor in star formation and appear less evolved compared to bright galaxies . their lack of evolution may be due to the presence of massive dark halos that inhibit the formation of disk instabilities such as bars and spiral arms , which can trigger star formation activity in galaxies .",
    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have been detected at optical wavelengths in several bulge - dominated giant lsb galaxies ( sprayberry et al .",
    "1993 ; schombert 1998 ) .",
    "this is suprising as agn are generally associated with bright , star forming galaxies ( ho , philipenko & sargent 1997 ) .",
    "not much is known about the radio continuum emission from lsb galaxies .",
    "several giant lsb galaxies such as ugc  1922 are bright in the nvss vla survey at 1.4 ghz ( condon et al .",
    "1998 ) , and a millimeter continuum source was detected in ugc  6614 .",
    "these observations suggest that agn in giant lsbs have properties similar to those found in bright galaxies even though the galaxy evolutionary histories are very different .",
    "and beam is  7 ; ( b )  ugc  1922 : contours levels are 12 , 14 , 16 , 18 , 20 , 22 , and 24  @xmath0 where @xmath1 and the beam is   24 ; ( c )  ugc  6614 : contours levels are 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 and 11  @xmath0 where @xmath2 and the beam is   15.,width=513,height=163 ]",
    "this poster presents preliminary results of a larger study of giant lsb galaxies using the gmrt .",
    "( i )  pgc  045080 is close to edge on and fairly distant ( @xmath3  ) .",
    "early optical studies did not detect an agn in this galaxy ( sprayberry et al .",
    "1993 ) but weak agn activity may be present ( das et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the galaxy is poor in star formation , fairly isolated and has a lopsided , massive hi disk .",
    "( ii )  ugc  1922 has a bright nucleus or bulge and a very low surface brightness disk .",
    "it is also fairly distant ( @xmath4  ) .",
    "it is one of the rare lsb galaxies that have been detected in co and there is a significant concentration of molecular gas in the galaxy nucleus ( oneil & schinnerer 2003 ) .",
    "the galaxy hosts an agn that is visible in optical emission as well as radio continuum .",
    "( iii )  ugc  6614 is a relatively nearby lsb galaxy ( @xmath5  ) .",
    "it is close to face on , has a prominent bulge and fairly distinct spiral arms that extend well into the disk .",
    "the agn is visible in optical emission and appears as a compact core in the nvss map and at millimeter wavelengths as well ( das et al .",
    "we observed all three galaxies from august , 2005 to march , 2006 using the gmrt , which is an array of thirty radio antennas arranged in a compact core and y shaped configuration .",
    "( i )  pgc  045080 was observed at 1.4  ghz , 610  mhz and 325  mhz ( das et al .",
    "the emission is extended and at 610  mhz appears to have two lobes associated with the nucleus ( figure  1a ) .",
    "the spectral index between 1.4  ghz and 325  mhz is @xmath6=-0.63 ( where @xmath7 ) .",
    "( ii )  the continuum emission at 610  mhz in ugc  1922 is also extended and the peak is offset from the galaxy center by a few arcseconds ( figure  1b ) . the spectral index between 1.4  ghz and 610  mhz is 3 suggesting that it may be a giga - hertz peaked spectrum ( gps ) radio source .",
    "( iii )  the 610  mhz continuum map of ugc  6614 reveals a radio jet that extends well into the disk ( figure  1c ) .",
    "one side appears brighter than the other and may represent the nearer jet .",
    "the core is bright and has a peak brightness of 3  mjy at 610  mhz .",
    "the spectral index is flat above 1.4  ghz but at 610  mhz is -0.53 .",
    "we have found extended radio continuum emission associated with agn activity in 3 giant lsb galaxies . in at least two cases",
    "these represent radio jets / lobes .",
    "thus though these galaxies are optically dim , their nuclei can host agn and associated energetic activities .",
    "we thank the gmrt staff for help in the observations .",
    "the gmrt is operated by the national center for radio astrophysics of the tata institute of fundamental research .",
    "we have used an sdss image of pgc045080a and a 2mass image of ugc1922 .",
    "we thank alice quillen for the r band image of ugc6614 . this work has made use of the nasa / ipac science archive ."
