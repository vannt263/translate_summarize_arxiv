    "in spite of julius caesar s view ( shakespeare 1623 , act 3 scene i ) , polaris is in fact one of the more inconstant of stars .",
    "in addition to not being precisely located at the north celestial pole , it is a variable star , with a pulsation period of nearly 4 days and a current pulsation amplitude of around 30 - 50 mmag in the v band . additionally , polaris is not even constant in its inconstancy , as both the pulsation period and the pulsation amplitude have changed in the past .",
    "the amplitude in particular has changed substantially and is currently still changing , as we will describe in this paper .",
    "polaris is an important star for a number of reasons ",
    "it is the nearest cepheid variable and a star where we can see stellar evolution taking place .",
    "understanding the location of polaris on the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( and particularly the relationship of polaris to the instability strip ; whether it is a star undergoing its first or third or even fifth crossing ) and the nature of the pulsations ( whether fundamental model or an overtone pulsator ) are all important questions in stellar evolution .",
    "the first evidence suggesting the variable nature of polaris was presented 150 years ago @xcite with strong confirmation , along with the correct period , being supplied by @xcite via radial velocity measurements .",
    "photometric detection of the pulsations were presented several years afterwards @xcite .",
    "a large number of observations have have been made in the intervening years , which have helped to build a picture of how the star has been evolving over the last century and a half . despite this",
    ", there is still a great deal of interest in polaris due to the changes in the period and amplitude of the oscillations , as well as unusual events such as the change from a steady decline in amplitude to a very rapid decline from 0.1 mag to @xmath30.02 mag during the 1960 s . during this time",
    ", the period also readjusted downwards .",
    "the rate of period change is an important diagnostic tool for determining which crossing of the instability strip a cepheid is undergoing .",
    "the recent analysis of the o - c residuals of polaris by @xcite has led to the suggestion that the period of polaris is currently increasing at a rate of 4.5 s yr@xmath1 .",
    "this rate of period change is unusual for a cepheid with this period and adds to the confusion as to what stage of its evolution polaris is actually at . in the following sections we present new smei photometric observations of polaris ,",
    "discuss the amplitude changes that we observe during the course of the observations and also look at the o - c residuals and interpret these in the light of recent measurements of the period .",
    "the new photometry we present was obtained using the smei instrument on board the usaf coriolis spacecraft , which was launched in january 2003 into an 840  km sun - synchronous polar orbit with an orbital period of 101 minutes .",
    "smei consists of 3 cameras , each with a field of view of @xmath4 , which monitors nearly the entire sky over one orbit .",
    "consequently , we obtain data for polaris on essentially every orbital pass .",
    "smei has a roughly triangular pass band with a peak quantum efficiency of 47% at 700 nm and falling to 5% at 430 nm and 1025 nm .",
    "although smei is a small instrument , the fact that it has monitored the entire sky with a cadence of @xmath5 minutes for over 4 years , results in stellar light curves , for bright stars , that are unprecedented .",
    "an overview of the smei instrument can be found in @xcite , and an overview of stellar variability results being obtained with smei will be presented in @xcite .",
    "smei results on the variability of the red giant arcturus can be found in @xcite .",
    "the polaris data spans from april 2003 to october 2007 , with a 70% fill throughout this period of time , giving us an exceptional data sample to investigate the period and amplitude variations of the 3.97 day oscillations exhibited by polaris .",
    "the full details of the reduction pipeline for generating time - series from the smei data will be presented in @xcite , so we only discuss the data reduction briefly here .",
    "the raw images obtained by the smei instrument are bias subtracted , have a temperature scaled dark current signal removed , and are flat fielded .",
    "hot pixels and high energy particle hits are corrected on the images via interpolation , before aperture photometry is performed .",
    "the resulting light curves are corrected for systematic effects resulting from the variation of the psf as it moves across the ccd and vignetting / optical effects . removing a best fit sine curve from the entirety of the dataset highlighted non - regular systematic variations at the few mmag level which we have largely removed using a smoothed box car average obtained with a window width of @xmath312 days .",
    "we finally removed a number of spurious data points from the data , which were primarily due to uncorrected cosmic rays , by performing a 3 sigma clip on short 28 day sections of data from which the best fitting sinusoidal relation for each section had been removed .",
    "the resulting time series can be seen in fig .",
    "[ timeseries ] along with a closer view of a section of data taken from 13th september 2006 to 29th november 2006 , which highlights the level of precision we are able to attain over a long baseline .",
    "in order to study the amplitude of the 3.97 day ( 2.914@xmath6hz ) oscillation we have generated fourier spectra of both long ( 8 - 9 months ) and short ( 28 day ) sections of the time series data .",
    "the resulting trend from computing the mean amplitude in each data chunk is shown in fig .",
    "[ three_epoch ] and fig .",
    "[ monthly_fft ] . to create the fourier spectra , we first subtracted a robust mean from the time series and the residuals were then converted to a change in magnitude relative to the mean magnitude . after computing the fourier spectra we ensured that in every case the power corresponding to the 3.97 day oscillation was restricted to a single bin , and padding the data with zeros to artificially enhance the resolution of the fourier spectra had no effect on the computed amplitudes .",
    "= 5.8 cm    = 5.75 cm    fig .",
    "[ three_epoch ] shows the 2.914 @xmath6hz peak in the fourier spectra for three @xmath39 month sections of the light curve .",
    "the peaks for the 2003 and 2004 - 2005 data have been offset by @xmath70.8 and @xmath70.4 @xmath6hz respectively to highlight the increase in the amplitude over time .",
    "on the assumption that polaris is oscillating in the first overtone mode ( see section 4 ) , we do not detect any significant power at the expected frequency for the fundamental mode , i.e. @xmath8hz . the trend of the increasing amplitude is highlighted more clearly in fig .",
    "[ monthly_fft ] where we have plotted the mean amplitude calculated in consecutive 28 day chunks of data .",
    "each 28 day section contained 400 data points after data gaps had been filled with zero values .",
    "the best fitting linear relation describing the rate of increase for the peak to peak amplitude is @xmath9 mmag yr@xmath1 .",
    "some of the scatter in the plot is attributed to the varying amplitude of the oscillations , which @xcite also saw in wire observations , and suggested it could be due to the analogue of the blazkho effect in cepheids . in our analysis , however , we do not see any significant periodic variations in the amplitude above a level of @xmath10  mmag appearing consistently throughout the observations .",
    "this is to our knowledge the first highly confident detection of the amplitude increase over the last few years from photometric measurements , although some hint has been given previously @xcite .",
    "this completely contradicts the claim that polaris is about to cease its variability and leave the instability strip @xcite , although this was based somewhat on an erroneous result .",
    ".recent measurements of the period of polaris suggest that it has undergone another recent decline .",
    "there seems to have been a large decline between 1988 and 1993 , with the rate slowing in the last ten years . in total , the period has reduced by around 200 seconds over the last 20 years.[periods ] [ cols=\"^ , < , < \" , ]     the o - c residuals obtained from @xcite , along with the new values calculated from our data are plotted in fig .",
    "we have used the same time regimes as this paper ( i.e. pre-1963 and post 1965 ) to determine our rate of period change . the best fitting parabolic relation for observations before 1963 , as determined by @xcite , provides an estimate for the rate of period increase over this time of @xmath11 s yr@xmath1 the best fitting parabolic relation for the data since 1963 , with the inclusion of our new measurements suggests the mean rate of increase for the period has increased to @xmath2 s yr@xmath1 this relation is again shown in fig .",
    "[ oc ] . ignoring the data from 1966 , as in @xcite , insignificantly alters the value to @xmath12 s yr@xmath1 . ignoring the datum from 1965",
    ", however , causes a dramatic change to the calculated value , giving instead @xmath13 s yr@xmath14 .",
    "it is clear therefore that the mean rate of period increase over the last 50 years has been between 4.4 and 5 s yr@xmath1 , consistent with the rate before 1963 .",
    "if one looks more closely at recent measurements for the period , however , it does appear that it may have recently undergone a rapid decline , similar to that seen in the early 1960 s .",
    "table  [ periods ] shows the period as measured several times over the last 20 years with the values obtained from @xcite and references therein , together with the period measured from our new results .",
    "the decline is very evident , and amounts to a decrease of around 200 seconds during the last 20 years , but the rate has been much slower over the last ten years than it was between 1987 and 1997 . additionally , although our results are fairly consistent with a period increase of 4.9  s  yr@xmath1 , they do follow a slightly shallower trend which is likely due to the recent decrease in period .",
    "we will now discuss these results in the context of stellar evolution and ascertain what implications they have on the evolutionary stage of polaris .",
    "there is a great deal of evidence to suggest that polaris is a first overtone ( s - cepheid ) oscillator .",
    "@xcite used the hipparcos parallax ( measured to be @xmath15  mas for polaris ) to fit period - luminosity models to a sample of cepheids and concluded that the best fit for polaris resulted if it was treated as a first overtone pulsator .",
    "the updated value for the hipparcos parallax of polaris is @xmath16  mas @xcite , therefore this conclusion is still valid .",
    "@xcite used interferometry to measure the radius of polaris to be @xmath17 , and again this is only consistent with the pulsation period if polaris is a first overtone pulsator .",
    "the mean rate of change of the period and the small amplitude of the oscillations are also indicators that polaris oscillates in an overtone mode .",
    "combining this with the fact that polaris exhibits a highly symmetrical light curve , it exhibits all of the features we expect from s - cepheids .",
    "= 5.8 cm    = 5.65 cm    @xcite suggest that polaris exists at the cool edge of the region of the instability strip occupied by the s - cepheids , but that the positive period change could not be due to evolution as the star would be evolving towards the centre of the instability strip , which would defy the previously declining amplitude . @xcite",
    "also place polaris on the red edge of the instability strip for putative first crossers , which corresponds to the s - cepheid red edge in this case .",
    "they do however suggest the possibility of polaris being a fundamental pulsator , which is unlikely given the evidence above .",
    "@xcite on the other hand believed that polaris was about to evolve out of the instability strip completely , which would require it to be near the edge of the instability strip , which it certainly does not appear to be .",
    "the behaviour we are now seeing from polaris is consistent with what we expect from a cepheid located in the instability strip where @xcite and @xcite suggest , but the conclusion that the period change is not due to evolution may be incorrect .",
    "= 7.9 cm    firstly , consider the evidence that the period has once again undergone a rapid decline , which could be a phase of blueward evolution , as @xcite suggests could be the case for the 1963 - 66 period readjustment .",
    "secondly , the amplitude appeared to cease its decline in the early 1990s , and is now seemingly increasing again .",
    "one might expect to see such behaviour if polaris was undergoing an evolutionary change in its oscillation mode .",
    "if we look at the models for s - cepheids produced by @xcite , and specifically look at the location of polaris in the computed instability regimes then , as fig .",
    "[ ismodel ] shows , polaris lies on the red edge of the overtone instability strip for their non - linear convective model , which is able to generate light and radial velocity curves very similar to those found observationally . if the true red edge of the first overtone instability strip lies close to the one computed in this fbk model , then polaris is in fact undergoing a change from being a first overtone pulsator ( assuming it is evolving to the cooler side of the instability strip ) to becoming either a fundamental pulsator or a double mode pulsator .",
    "the position of polaris in fig .",
    "[ ismodel ] suggests that its mass is not quite great enough to enter the fundamental pulsator regime , which occurs for masses greater than around @xmath18 ( the knee in the model track ) , but recent measurements by @xcite for example , do not place enough of a constraint on the mass to make an absolute determination as to which regime polaris will enter .",
    "if polaris is about to cross into another pulsation regime , then we might expect to see occasional blips in the period as this readjustment phase takes place .",
    "finally , the crossing mode of polaris is also uncertain .",
    "@xcite suggest that despite polaris exhibiting a deficiency of carbon and an over - abundance of nitrogen @xcite , this can not be interpreted in any fashion to determine the crossing mode , such as was done by @xcite .",
    "somewhat controversially , @xcite suggests that polaris has a small over - abundance of carbon , which would certainly place it in a first crossing scenario .",
    "the rate of period change for cepheids is an indicator of the crossing mode @xcite .",
    "if we assume polaris to be oscillating in the first overtone mode , and take the rate of period change over the last 150 years to be + 4.5 s yr@xmath1 , then this is a factor of @xmath33 too small for a first crossing cepheid and about the same factor too large for a third crossing cepheid .",
    "@xcite suggest that the observable characteristics of polaris are most consistent with a first time crosser .",
    "interestingly , however , if one only considers the trend in the period from the last 20 years , then we see a decline at a rate of @xmath19 s yr@xmath1 .",
    "this is actually consistent with a first overtone cepheid undergoing its second crossing .",
    "the possibility that polaris is in its second crossing was also discussed by @xcite .",
    "we must be cautious , however , as the rate over the last fourteen years , using measurements with much better precision than those presented in @xcite , only suggest a decline of @xmath20 s yr@xmath1 .",
    "clearly , it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions on the crossing mode at present .",
    "the new results obtained with smei strongly suggest the amplitude of polaris is once again increasing",
    ". the star does seem to be oscillating in the first overtone mode , but likely lies close to the red edge of the instability strip for s - cepheids , and is therefore likely to soon evolve into either a fundamental or double - mode pulsation cepheid , assuming the cepheid is undergoing its first or third crossing .",
    "it is uncertain how quickly polaris will evolve across the boundary between pulsation regimes and what behaviour the cepheid will exhibit as it does so .",
    "one slight oddity in the results is the lack of evidence for the fundamental mode of oscillation being present , but this may appear in the near future .",
    "it is therefore crucial that high precision monitoring of this star is continued for the foreseeable future so that the changes can be watched closely .",
