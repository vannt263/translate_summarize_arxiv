    "during the past decades dilepton production in high - energy hadron hadron collisions ( the so - called drell - yan ( dy ) process  @xcite ) has played an important role in order to pin down parton distributions ( pdfs ) of hadrons .",
    "while the main focus was on pdfs of the nucleon , also information on the partonic structure of the pion was already obtained through drell - yan measurements .",
    "the crucial tool required for the extraction of pdfs is the qcd - factorization theorem  @xcite which applies if the invariant mass of the dilepton pair is sufficiently large .",
    "experimentally , the drell - yan process is quite challenging because of the relatively low counting rates . on the other hand , from the theoretical point of view",
    "it is the cleanest hard hadron hadron scattering process .",
    "the fact that no hadron is detected in the final state simplifies the proof of factorization in comparison to hadron hadron collisions with hadronic final states .",
    "this important point is one of the main reasons for the continued interest in the drell - yan reaction .",
    "currently , not less than six programs for future drell - yan measurements are pursued .",
    "these plans comprise dilepton production in nucleon nucleon collisions ( at rhic  @xcite , j - parc ( kek )  @xcite , ihep ( protvino )  @xcite , and at the jinr ( dubna )  @xcite ) , in antiproton nucleon collisions ( at fair ( gsi )  @xcite ) , as well as in pion nucleon collisions ( at compass ( cern )  @xcite ) .",
    "past measurements exclusively considered the unpolarized cross section , but all future programs are also aiming at polarization measurements . including",
    "polarization of the incoming hadrons opens up a variety of new opportunities for studying the strong interaction in both the perturbative and the nonperturbative regime .",
    "here we only mention the access to the transversity distribution of the nucleon  @xcite , and to transverse momentum dependent parton distributions ( tmds ) .",
    "the tmds not only depend on the longitudinal momentum of a parton inside a hadron but also on its ( intrinsic ) transverse momentum and , in general , describe the strength of various intriguing spin - spin or spin - orbit correlations of the parton - hadron system ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for more information on tmds ) .    in order to analyze upcoming data from polarized drell - yan measurements",
    "it is necessary to have a general and concise formalism at hand . the main motivation for writing the present paper is to provide such a framework .",
    "to this end we decompose the hadronic tensor of the polarized drell - yan process in terms of 48 basis tensors which are multiplied by structure functions .",
    "we limit ourselves to photon exchange and do not consider weak interaction effects . to ensure electromagnetic gauge invariance of the hadronic tensor we make use of a projector method proposed in ref .  @xcite . on the basis of the hadronic tensor",
    "we then write down the general structure of the angular distribution of the drell - yan process .",
    "this step is most conveniently done in a dilepton rest frame like the collins - soper frame  @xcite .",
    "in addition to our model - independent results we also consider the process in the parton model approximation , where we distinguish between two cases : ( 1 ) cross section integrated upon the transverse momentum @xmath1 of the dilepton pair ; ( 2 ) cross section kept differential in @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the invariant mass of the dilepton pair . while in the former case one ends up with ordinary forward pdfs , in the latter tmds enter in the parton model description and in a full qcd treatment  @xcite .",
    "in addition to our model - independent treatment we also consider the process in the parton model approximation by concentrating on the situation when the cross section is kept differential in the transverse momentum @xmath1 of the dilepton pair . in this case",
    "tmds enter the parton model description as well as a full qcd treatment  @xcite .",
    "part of the results presented here were already given in the literature  @xcite , and we comment on other work during the course of the manuscript .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , a complete formalism for the polarized drell - yan process has not been worked out before .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we fix part of our notation and give the general form of the cross section in the one - photon exchange approximation .",
    "section iii contains the decomposition of the hadronic tensor in terms of basis tensors and structure functions , while in section iv some discussion on reference frames is given . in section",
    "v we present the general angular distribution of the polarized drell - yan process which can be derived from the results of section iii in a straightforward manner .",
    "section vi contains the results for the structure functions in the parton model approximation .",
    "we conclude in section vii .",
    "to be now specific we consider the dilepton production @xmath4 with @xmath5 and @xmath6 denoting the 4-momenta and the spin vectors of the incoming hadrons .",
    "one has @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and corresponding relations for the second hadron . throughout this work the mass of the leptons in the final state",
    "is neglected .",
    "we will sum over the helicities @xmath10 , @xmath11 of the leptons .    at large invariant mass @xmath3 of the dilepton pair",
    "the process  ( [ e : dilepton ] ) can approximately be described in the drell - yan model  @xcite , which corresponds to the parton model approximation . according to this approach a quark from hadron @xmath12 and an antiquark from hadron @xmath13 ( and vice versa ) annihilate into a timelike virtual photon which subsequently decays into a lepton pair ( see fig .",
    "[ f : dy_amp ] ) .",
    "this means the process proceeds according to @xmath14 where the 4-momentum of the virtual photon is given by @xmath15 .",
    "describes both the 4-momentum of the virtual photon as well as the invariant mass @xmath16 of the dilepton pair .",
    "this should , however , not lead to any confusion . ]",
    "note that the meaning of  ( [ e : gammadecay ] ) remains valid if higher order qcd corrections are taken into account .    in the one - photon exchange approximation",
    "the ( frame - independent ) cross section of the drell - yan process is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 represents the flux of the incoming hadrons .",
    "if hadron masses are neglected one can write @xmath19 .",

    "the hadronic tensor is decomposed into a set of 48 basis tensors multiplied by scalar functions ( structure functions ) . in doing so the conditions  ( [ e : gaugeinv ] ) and  ( [ e : parity ] )",
    "considerably reduce the number of allowed basis tensors , while the hermiticity constraint  ( [ e : hermiticity ] ) implies that the structure functions are real .",
    "note that time - reversal does not impose any constraint on the hadronic tensor , because this operation converts the two - particle hadronic in - state into a two - particle out - state , and both states are not related . in section",
    "vi the hadronic tensor is considered in the parton model approximation .",
    "the angular distribution of the drell - yan cross section is most conveniently be considered in a dilepton rest frame like the collins - soper frame  @xcite or the gottfried - jackson frame  @xcite . in any dilepton rest frame",
    ", one can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ e : xs_1 ] ) according to @xmath29 where the solid angle @xmath30 specifies the orientation of the leptons . in section",
    "iv we elaborate a bit more on reference frames with the main focus on the center - of - mass frame ( _ cm_-frame ) and the collins - soper frame ( cs - frame ) .",
    "the total hadronic tensor can be decomposed into the unpolarized , single polarized ( for hadron @xmath12 and hadron @xmath13 ) , and double polarized tensor according to @xmath31 in the following we merely have to consider the symmetric part of @xmath25 because the spin - averaged leptonic tensor in  ( [ e : leptontensor ] ) is symmetric under the exchange @xmath32 .      since the unpolarized tensor depends on the 4-vectors @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 one can immediately write down the tensor basis @xmath36 \\\\ h_{u,2}^{\\mu\\nu } & \\ , = \\ , q^{\\mu}q^{\\nu } \\ , , \\nonumber \\displaybreak[0 ] \\\\",

    "therefore one can write in a first step @xmath37 where the structure functions @xmath38 depend on the invariants @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "so far we have not yet used the gauge invariance constraint  ( [ e : gaugeinv ] ) which , in fact , implies that not all of the @xmath38 are independent . contracting the tensor in  ( [ e : tensor_u_0 ] ) with the 4-momentum of the virtual photon and imposing  ( [ e : gaugeinv ] )",
    "one readily finds @xmath42 these three relations follow because in @xmath43 the terms proportional to @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 must vanish separately .",
    "now one can use  ( [ e : gaugeinv_elim ] ) to eliminate three structure functions and consequently ends up with a hadronic tensor given by just four independent structure functions that are multiplied by four independent basis tensors .",
    "the explicit form of the basis tensors depends of course on which of the structure functions are eliminated .",
    "though this procedure of implementing gauge invariance in principle is straightforward it gets rather cumbersome for single and double polarization because in those cases considerably more structure functions and basis tensors are involved .",

    "this means that one arrives at the following final form of the unpolarized hadronic tensor : @xmath49 with the four structure functions @xmath50 , and the tensor basis @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ e : tensorba_u_1 ] ) we make use of the vectors @xmath52 which vanish upon contraction with @xmath3 .",
    "needless to say that the tensor in  ( [ e : tensor_u_1 ] ) is frame - independent .",
    "the contraction with the leptonic tensor can therefore be performed in any frame . in the context of the parton model calculation in section vi , for instance , this contraction is carried out in the _ cm_-frame .",
    "the specific form of the tensor  ( [ e : tensor_u_1 ] ) is by no means unique .",
    "other sets of basis tensors can be found in the literature ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and also  @xcite ) , and it is straightforward to write down relations between different sets . here",
    "we refrain from doing so because it does not give much further insight and , in addition , is not needed for the main purpose of this paper .",

    "in particular , we point out that the parton model result @xmath207 has a model - independent status .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that , by means of charge conjugation , in the case of proton - antiproton dy one also finds symmetries for structure functions ( like @xmath208 ) , and relations between various structure functions . in particular , when studying single spin effects one can obtain the same information by either polarizing the proton or the antiproton .",
    "* if the cross section is integrated upon @xmath1 only three structure functions ( @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 ) survive . neglecting hadron masses",

    ". however , if intrinsic transverse parton motion in the initial state is taken into account the boer - mulders function @xmath215 contributes to the @xmath131 term according to  ( [ e : uu_2 ] ) which may explain the observed violation of the lam - tung relation  @xcite .",
