    "the age of the youngest population of stars is consistent with the observation that agc  226067 has hii regions .",

    "this and other properties of agc  226067 are shown in table  [ table : properties ] .",
    "we can use this stellar mass to obtain an estimate of the star formation rate ( sfr ) of the main body ; assuming uniform star formation over the past 50  myr , we obtain a sfr of 1.1@xmath810@xmath29  m@xmath30/yr .",
    "this is in general agreement with revised values of the sfr based off the muse spectra ( beccari et al .",
    ", private communication ) .",
    "we can also look at the nature of star formation in this object by examining where it falls on a kennicutt - schmidt relation of sfr density ( @xmath31 ) vs.  gas density .",
    "assuming our sfr estimate for the main body and a radius of 1.1  kpc ( table  [ table : properties ] ) , we get a @xmath31@xmath322.9@xmath810@xmath33  m@xmath30/yr / kpc@xmath11 .",
    "the main body has an estimated hi mass of 1.5@xmath810@xmath34  m@xmath30 in a deconvolved area of 3.08@xmath810@xmath35 pc@xmath11 @xcite , giving a gas surface density of 0.49 m@xmath30/pc@xmath11 .",
    "these values suggest the star formation in agc  226067 is occurring at the low end of gas surface densities in comparison to nearby galaxy disks @xcite , and is slightly more efficient than that typically seen in the outer regions of nearby spirals and dwarfs @xcite .",
    "several previous works have also pointed out a secondary clump of blue stars ( figure  [ fig : image ] ) , located @xmath01.6 ( @xmath08 kpc ) to the northeast of the main body of agc  226067 @xcite .",
    "a cmd of this region is shown in the middle - left panel at the top of figure  [ fig : cmds ] .",
    "the stars in this secondary knot are consistent with the stellar population of the main body of agc  226067 .",
    "although it is not sufficiently populated to confirm the presence of stars with age @xmath2510 myr , it is likely the case given the secondary clump has several hii regions @xcite .",
    "again , there are few old rgb stars , in stark contrast to the nearby virgo dwarf .",
    "we estimate the stellar mass in the secondary body identically to the technique employed on the main body and find @xmath7=5.5@xmath64.2@xmath810@xmath36 @xmath10 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "two other regions around agc  226067 have been discussed in the literature as possible physically - associated extensions , and we examine our _ hst _ photometry at these positions in more detail here .    the first is an additional clump of hi gas , discovered and dubbed agc  229490 by @xcite , which is physically separated from the main body of agc  226067 , but has a consistent hi - derived velocity ( v@xmath37=@xmath1123 and @xmath1142 km s@xmath12 , respectively ) .",
    "we have constructed a cmd of agc  229490 corresponding to the position of the gas cloud , and its rough dimensions ( ra : 12:21:53.8 , dec : + 13:29:08 , with size 45@xmath845  ; * ? ? ?",
    "the cmd is largely consistent with several equal area background cmds , possibly with an overdensity of @xmath05 or fewer stars .",
    "thus the secondary hi cloud , agc 229490 , is largely star - free .",
    "more recently , a deep ground based image of the agc  226067 field suggested the presence of an additional blue stellar over density located @xmath01 arcmin to the northeast of the main body @xcite .",
    "a cmd of the region again suggests that this field consists of primarily foreground stars , although there are a handful of stars that are consistent with a @xmath07 - 50 myr stellar population .",
    "the lack of rgb stars in the cmd of agc  226067 is striking when compared with the serendipitous virgo dwarf galaxy in our acs field of view , which has an absolute magnitude of @xmath38@xmath3@xmath111.4 .",
    "we take two approaches for constraining an old stellar population in agc  226067 s main body .",
    "first , we use the number of stars in the region of the cmd where we find rgb stars in dw  j122147 + 132853 to constrain the old stellar mass of agc  226067 .",
    "we defined a cmd box surrounding the stars within dw  j122147 + 132853 ( with @xmath23@xmath1@xmath24 between 0.30 and 1.66 and @xmath24 between 26.20 and 27.67 ) ; after background subtraction we find 43@xmath67 in dw  j122147 + 132853 .",
    "however for the main body of agc  226067 , we find only 4@xmath64 stars .",
    "using the absolute magnitude of dw  j122147 + 132853 ( @xmath39 ) , this translates to a limiting absolute magnitude for the old population of agc  226067 of @xmath5@xmath21@xmath18.8 mag , or @xmath7@xmath256@xmath810@xmath40 @xmath10 ( assuming a @xmath41=2 @xmath10/@xmath42 for an old stellar population ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we measure the integrated magnitude for the main body within an 11  radius around agc  226067 ( after masking background galaxies ) of @xmath43=@xmath111.3@xmath60.3 and @xmath44=@xmath111.2@xmath60.3 , translating to @xmath5=@xmath111.3@xmath60.3 . for the age range of 7 - 50  myr ,",
    "the @xcite models suggest @xmath41=0.0130.06 @xmath10/@xmath42 ; this suggests a stellar mass of @xmath7=4 - 17@xmath810@xmath9 @xmath10 , consistent with our measurement of @xmath7= 5.4@xmath61.3@xmath810@xmath9 @xmath10 in section  [ sec : stellarpops ] .",
    "thus there is no need for an underlying old population to explain the system s absolute magnitude .",
    "this measured absolute magnitude is fully consistent with previous ground - based data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but is @xmath02-@xmath45 brighter than @xcite .",
    "we also subtracted the point sources in our dolphot catalog from the f606w and f814w acs mosaic images , and have analyzed the remaining diffuse light to constrain an old stellar population . using this image and the same 11  annulus ,",
    "we measure a diffuse , star - subtracted magnitude of @xmath43=@xmath19.8@xmath60.4 and @xmath44=@xmath110.0@xmath60.5 , which corresponds to @xmath5=@xmath19.8 @xmath60.5 mag .",
    "the errors on these measurements include the range of values obtained using direct galaxy removal and background annulus subtraction .",
    "we can compare the amount of diffuse light to that expected from the faint unresolved stars of the @xmath07 - 50 myr stellar population revealed in the cmd , but are below the detection limit of the acs data . to estimate this , we first calculated the total magnitude of resolved stars consistent with this population in the main body of agc  226067 and used it as an anchor for integrating the luminosity function below our acs detection limit , assuming a 750 myr stellar population with [ fe / h]=@xmath10.3 and the associated padova luminosity function @xcite and a chabrier initial mass function . depending on the choice of age of the stellar population , and the filter , our resolved stellar sources should make up @xmath045 - 70% of the total luminosity of agc  226067 , implying a diffuse stellar component from the young stellar population with @xmath5=@xmath110.4@xmath60.2 mag ( where the error bars encapsulate the allowed range when varying the age of the stellar population ) .",
    "thus , the observed diffuse component of agc  226067 ( directly measured as @xmath5=@xmath19.8 @xmath60.5 mag ) is fully consistent with a stellar population belonging solely to the apparent young stellar population , with no need to invoke any associated older population . given the apparent lack of an old stellar population , agc  226067 can not be considered a typical dwarf irregular - like galaxy as these systems all have an old rgb population at _ hst _ depths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this strongly suggests a tidal origin for agc  226067 ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) ; unlike previously known tidal dwarfs , agc  226067 is extremely isolated , @xmath0350  kpc projected distance from the nearest large galaxies ; the origin of the system is discussed further in section  5 .",
    "the optical appearance of agc  226067 in three - color rgb images , combined with its strong detection in _ galex _ imaging , is striking ( see * ? ? ?",
    "motivated to understand the uniqueness of agc  226067 we undertook a search of a 20 deg@xmath11 region in the next generation virgo cluster survey ( ngvs ) footprint to identify similar systems .",

    "two candidates visually similar to agc  226067 were identified , and are shown in figure  [ fig : newobjects ] .",
    "each is characterized by an over - density of compact blue sources with strong galex uv emission .",
    "the objects also lack a diffuse reddish galaxy component , exhibited by dwarf galaxies throughout the ngvs imaging .",
