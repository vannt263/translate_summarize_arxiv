    "people frequently face diverse situations that offer a wide choice of options , such as when looking for a restaurant , hotel , phone model or any basic good in the supermarket .",
    "the number of goods increases every day .",
    "it is estimated that approximately 50000 new products are introduced every year in the us  @xcite . even within each category of items",
    ", there may be many brands and item variations without differentiated attractiveness .",
    "this leads to the problem of facing too many choices , termed `` overchoice '' or choice overload  @xcite . to make decisions in such situations can be costly , and this stressful process leads to poor decisions or no decisions at all  @xcite",
    "then , the advantages of multiple choices can be canceled by the disadvantages of a more complicated choice process .",
    "in fact , despite representing , apparently , a positive development , many options may hinder the process of choice .",
    "for example , people with many purchase options tend to have more difficulty in choosing and may end up buying nothing  @xcite .",
    "motivated by these observations , we wonder to what extent people interactions , leaving aside their individual psychology , contribute to this scenario by introducing , for instance , conflict and frustration .",
    "then , by means of a model of opinion dynamics , we investigate the distribution of adoptions made by a population facing a large number of choices .    in modeling people s interactions , one of the basic ingredients is imitation , or social contagion .",
    "in fact , imitation occurs in diverse social contexts , from the dynamics of language learning to decision making .",
    "depending on the questions posed , diverse rules of contagion , from simple pairwise to group interactions , have been proposed and studied in recent years  @xcite .",
    "however , very few works deal with many choices  @xcite . in the vast majority of opinion models ,",
    "the opinion of an agent is represented by a binary variable , since many questions can be tackled through the assumption of two possible ( opposite ) attitudes , e.g. , being either favorable or unfavorable to a given choice .",
    "this kind of binary variable was also inspired in the spin-1/2 ising model , leading to transpose known results from physical to social questions . for our present purpose of studying multiple - choice situations ,",
    "it is natural to consider a potts - like state variable that can take several ( discrete ) values .",
    "we consider that changes from one state to another are governed , not by simple pairwise contagion , like in refs .",
    "@xcite but , instead , by a `` plurality '' rule  @xcite .",
    "this is grounded on the idea that an individual makes the choice that is the most popular among its contacts .",
    "in fact , when we have to choose or buy something , especially when there are so many similar options that there is not a favorite one _ a priori _ and is not feasible to examine them all , it is reasonable to take into account other people s preferences  @xcite . naturally , the closer is the person in our network of contacts , more importance we give to its opinion , since nearest neighbors in the network typically have similar interests and tastes .",
    "one can use that strategy not only in trivial or daily life issues but also in major ones such as political elections where many candidates compete . for changing or adopting a new opinion",
    ", however , a minimum of consensus amongst the contacts is necessary .",
    "this is expressed in a plurality rule , according to which an individual is persuaded to adopt the opinion shared by the largest number of its nearest neighbors .",
    "evolution rules based on a locally dominant opinion have been considered before , for instance , the majority rule for two states introduced by galam  @xcite .",
    "it was later extended to multistate opinions  @xcite , by considering all - to - all interactions where the individual and all its contacts adopt the same opinion of the majority at the same time . a variant where , instead of the local majority , the plurality opinion is considered was also studied  @xcite .",
    "but in the situations we address here , the decisions are not taken in groups or simultaneously , rather the choices of the individuals are affected by their knowledge of the previous choices of theirs contacts .",
    "therefore , we assume that one single individual opinion changes at a time . moreover , we will include the possibility of undecided people , which is a realistic feature , which has been taken into account in 3-state models , as natural extensions of binary cases  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as another differential , the dynamics of our model takes place in small - world networks , that , even if do not facilitate analytic treatment , are more realistic than regular or mean - field settings . as paradigms of small - world networks , we consider two classes with distinct degree distributions : erds - rnyi ( er )  @xcite and barabsi - albert ( ba )  @xcite networks .",
    "the details of the model will be defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : rules ] .",
    "the model encompasses instances where the different alternatives have similar initial attractiveness .",
    "many products sold in the internet with similar qualities and prices , e.g. , music albums , shoes , etc .",
    ", are within the model scope .",
    "we also make the simplification that individuals can differ only in the number of contacts .",
    "other heterogeneities of the agents might be also introduced in further work . by now",
    ", we ask a basic question : how a plurality rule molds the decision spectrum in the simplest , homogeneous , case ?",
    "first , we address the classical issue in this kind of problems , about whether a consensus state can be achieved or not , where all ( or almost all ) of the individuals share the same preference .",
    "then , in simulations of the model , we compute the fraction of the realizations reaching consensus . in non - consensus situations ,",
    "we analyze the distribution of adoptions .",
    "we also compute other relevant quantities such as the fraction of undecided people and the fraction of the population adopting the most popular alternative .",
    "the results will be presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "a plurality rule governs the opinion dynamics of @xmath1 agents interacting through their network of contacts .",
    "each agent @xmath2 , corresponding to a node in the network , has a potts - like opinion state variable @xmath3 , that can take the values @xmath4 representing @xmath0 electable alternatives ( options or choices , that we enumerate in an arbitrary order ) , as well as an `` undecided '' state @xmath5 , assessed when the individual has not adopted a defined option .",
    "the addition of the undecided state reflects the fact that sometimes people do not have a favorite choice .",
    "we focus on the dynamics developed in er and ba networks , as representative of small - world networks with homogeneous and heterogeneous degree distributions , respectively .",
    "however , for comparative purposes we will also consider random neighbors and nearest neighbors in a square lattice ( with periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "we assume that most individuals do not have a formed opinion _ a priori _ , except for initiators representative of each offered choice .",
    "then , we start the dynamics with all nodes in the @xmath6 state , except randomly chosen @xmath0 nodes , to each of which we attribute a different opinion @xmath7 .",
    "we consider the same number of initiators ( one initiator ) for each alternative , reflecting the equivalent attractiveness of all the alternatives .",
    "this kind of initial state has been used in opinion models for proportional elections  @xcite .    at each monte carlo",
    "( mc ) step of the dynamics , we visit all the nodes of the network in a random order and update them successively , in asynchronous mode .",
    "the state of the visited node @xmath2 is updated according to the following steps :    a.   we define the set of nodes , @xmath8 , formed by @xmath2 and its nearest neighbors .",
    "b.   we determine the plurality state @xmath9 , associated to node @xmath2 , as the state shared by the largest number of nodes in the set @xmath8 .",
    "c.   the agent @xmath2 will then adopt its corresponding plurality state .",
    "notice that , when we measure the state @xmath10 , we ignore the nodes in @xmath8 that have @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rules ] ) but the current opinion of site @xmath2 also counts to define @xmath10 .",
    "the updates are repeated and the dynamics stops when an absorbing state is attained , i.e. , if , at a mc step , none of the nodes changes its state .    , a node @xmath2 ( the central one in the figure ) and its neighbors form a group @xmath8 . in the case shown in the figure ,",
    "the plurality state is @xmath11 , since this is the state which is shared by more nodes .",
    "so , in the next time step , the node @xmath2 changes its opinion from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "notice that nodes with @xmath6 are ignored in the computation of the plurality state @xmath10 .",
    "]    let us remark that this dynamics differs from that of the sznajd type  @xcite where two or more individuals sharing the same opinion impose it to all their neighbors .",
    "it also differs in several aspects from the plurality rule introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite : i ) while in our case only the central node is affected , in  @xcite the whole group @xmath8 changes its opinion to the plurality state @xmath10 in a single update step , ii ) here the size of the interaction group @xmath8 is given by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the connectivity of site @xmath2 , instead of being constant ( anyway , the parameter @xmath16 plays the role of an effective @xmath17 , and they coincide in the limit of a highly homogeneous , or regular , network ) ; iii ) the possibility of indecision is not contemplated in  @xcite ; iv ) in an event of tie , the opinion of node @xmath2 remains unchanged in our model , while , in  @xcite , one of the dominant options is randomly selected .",
    "with respect to this last item , the present dynamics is more close to the majority rule version of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the dynamics becomes static because , when there is no local majority , the state of the group does not change .",
    "v ) in terms of the underlying network , here we consider small - world networks , while the dynamics in ref .",
    "@xcite was studied in the mean - field limit and over a square lattice .",
    "vi ) finally , another important difference is in the initial conditions : we consider that decided nodes are diluted in a sea of undecided nodes , instead of equiprobability of definite opinions .",
    "we follow the evolution of each realization of the dynamics until the final state is attained .",
    "distinct distributions of opinions can emerge in the final state depending on the amount of alternatives @xmath0 , the average connectivity @xmath18 , the network topology and size @xmath1 . fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamics ] illustrates the evolution of @xmath19 , the number of nodes that share the same opinion @xmath20 , in representative realizations of the dynamics on er networks of size @xmath21 .",

    "\\(a ) for instance , when @xmath22 and @xmath26 , we have a fragmented final state , where all initial values of @xmath27 have adopters .",
    "the number of undecided agents is predominant , representing about 20% of the population , in this particular realization .",
    "\\(b ) for larger connectivity ( e.g. , @xmath28 ) , several opinions are still possible in the stationary state , but the winner opinion @xmath29 is widely dominant . the number of undecided agents in the steady state has decreased significantly with respect to case ( a ) .",
    "\\(c ) for even larger connectivity ( e.g. , @xmath30 ) , consensus is likely .",
    "( d)-(f ) when @xmath0 is large , the number of undecided agents does not decrease monotonously when the connectivity increases .",
    "but , increasing the connectivity , consensus is reached , although it can take a larger time than for small @xmath0 .    in all cases ,",
    "the number of undecided nodes decreases with time , because undecided individuals are not produced by the dynamics in the present version of the model , but only introduced in the initial condition .",
    "the dynamics in er networks can be qualitatively understood as follows :    in a first regime , each opinion propagates invading the undecided neighbors .",
    "if the initiators are very diluted ( @xmath31 ) , and the connectivity is not too high , then each cluster of nodes with the same opinion can develop almost independently of each other , during several mc steps ( non - competitive regime ) . in this case , the initial growth is nearly exponential , described approximately by @xmath32 in er networks .",
    "when two or more clusters collide , a competitive regime starts .",
    "depending on the network , the competition can take place more or less evenly so that ties stagnate the evolution avoiding wide dominance of a given opinion ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamics].a , [ fig : dynamics].d and [ fig : dynamics].e ) .",
    "otherwise , a sort of rich - get - richer or cumulative advantage mechanism can take place . in that case",

    "[ fig : dynamics2 ] .",
    "notice that the winner opinion , as well as the number of decided people , for the same parameters , are favored in ba networks , where cumulative advantage effects are more accentuated .",
    "let us remark that in some extreme situations , given the initial conditions studied here ( one initiator for each state ) , the system does not evolve .",
    "this occurs , for instance , in the limit case when @xmath33 ( hence , each individual has a defined opinion ) or the connectivity of all sites is @xmath34 ( complete graph ) . in those extreme cases , ties forbid changes of state and the dynamics is frozen from the start .",

    "the evolution is essentially non - competitive .",
    "clusters grow from their initiators and , when they collide , the dynamics freezes due to ties in the interfaces , without entering a competitive phase , in contrast to er and ba networks where there are long - range links that break ties . since the initial growth occurs at the surface of the cluster ,",

    "the probability of consensus decays rapidly with @xmath0 and , above a critical value @xmath122 , the fraction @xmath82 becomes negligibly small .",
    "this effect is accentuated in the square lattice where for @xmath123 .",
    "the behavior of the characteristic fractions @xmath119 , @xmath110 and @xmath82 as a function of the average connectivity of the network , @xmath18 , are shown in fig .  [",

    "the plots of @xmath82 vs @xmath18 correspond to horizontal cuts of the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] .",
    "let us start by the case of ba networks ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : connectivity].b ) that exhibits a simple monotonic behavior , for the range shown in the figure .",
    "the three fractions increase with the connectivity . as observed in the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram].b , fig .",
    "[ fig : connectivity].b shows in more detail how the jump to consensus becomes more abrupt as @xmath0 increases and the critical value of the connectivity becomes nearly independent of the number of options ( @xmath96 ) , as also observed in the phase diagram .",
    "differently , in er networks ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : connectivity].a ) , @xmath124 increases with @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the average fraction of decided people @xmath119 first decreases with the connectivity down to a minimal value localized at @xmath125 .",
    "up to that point , the fraction of simulations attaining consensus @xmath82 is negligibly small .",
    "but , at @xmath125 , a transition occurs and both @xmath82 and @xmath119 rapidly increase with @xmath18 , up to 1 .",
    "one would expect to have more decided nodes when the connectivity is higher , like in the case of ba networks , since , in principle , more connections might facilitate information spreading .",
    "however , on a low connected network , opinion groups are typically isolated from each other . when links are added , and disconnected groups become connected , ties can occur .",
    "that is , on the one hand higher connectivity implies that groups of different opinions can be more connected among them and compete . on the other",
    ", a node will be aware of more opinions , making difficult the decision and keeping more undecided nodes .",
    "therefore , not only overchoice ( high @xmath0 ) may produce stagnation of the dynamics but also `` overlink '' or excess of contacts due to high @xmath18 .",
    "this explains the initial decrease of @xmath119 with @xmath25 which occurs up to a minimal value of @xmath119 .",
    "after that point , introducing more connections will allow a dominant group to impose its opinion , concomitantly @xmath82 increases until reaching its maximal value 1 .",

    "the behavior of the winner fraction @xmath99 ( black dotted lines ) is depicted only for the case @xmath23 .",

    "the existence of an abrupt transition from a situation where many opinions coexist to consensus indicates that , by adding just a few links or by removing a few choices , most people may come to adopt the same state .",
    "the transition to consensus is more abrupt in ba networks , and the jump width decreases with @xmath0 . in these networks , as discussed above , there is a dominant winner opinion group , that represents an important fraction of the population ( finite @xmath117 ) .",
    "the largest group gains additional adopters more easily , with cumulative advantage . near the critical connectivity ,",
    "when adding few links at random , it would be more probable to connect the very large group to smaller ones , and , as a consequence , they would be conquered by the dominant opinion , rapidly leading to consensus . in homogeneous er networks",
    "this transition is less abrupt , because a largely dominant group is less probable .",
    "the width of the transition region slightly increases with @xmath0 . for the extreme case of nearest neighbors interactions in square lattices , cumulative effects",
    "are completely absent , therefore , a transition to consensus is unlikely .      in non - consensus steady states ,",
    "a broad distribution of opinions across the population can emerge . in order to analyze the shape of the distributions",
    ", we built the normalized histograms of @xmath126 , where @xmath19 is the number of nodes with a given opinion @xmath20 .",
    "histograms were computed by accumulating realizations ending in non - consensus states .",
    "typical distributions are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdfs_k ] .",
    "one can identify exponential , log - normal and power - law behaviors .",
    ", @xmath126 , built over 50 samples , for @xmath127 , on er ( a ) and ba ( b ) networks with size @xmath88 , and different values of @xmath18 indicated on the figure .",
    "the solid lines are log - normal fits , the dotted lines exponential fits , and the dashed line with slope -3 was drawn for comparison . ]    in the er case , far enough from the critical frontier of consensus , the preferences are almost uniformly distributed with an exponential cutoff .",
    "when approaching consensus ( for instance by increasing @xmath25 ) the distribution adopts a log - normal shape .",
    "notice that this occurs in the region of the phase diagram where indecision prevails ( shadowed area in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] ) . in ba networks ,",
    "the distribution can also resemble a log - normal , but when approaching consensus the tail rises due to the existence of dominant winners .",
    "moreover , when the dynamics freezes early , @xmath126 tends to reflect the degree distribution with exponent @xmath128 .",

    "we analyzed data about items whose alternatives are not significantly differentiated ( for instance , in price and/or quality ) , as assumed in our model .",
    "we identified @xmath0 with the number of items within each category and we considered the amount of positive reviews ( those of 4 and 5 stars ) received by each item as indicator of its total number of adopters , that potentially might become spreaders of the product , in a situation alike that described by the present model .",
    "we analyzed all music albums from google play music  @xcite , whose prices are similar ( u$ @xmath130 ) .",
    "we also analyzed male sneakers from netshoes  @xcite , a brazilian e - commerce for sport goods . since in this case the prices are more disperse , we split the data into two subsets : items with prices below and above the median ( about r$ @xmath137 ) . for each set of data we computed the histogram of the number of adoptions ( i.e. , number of reviews attributing 4 and 5 stars ) , as shown in fig .",

    "comparison of figs .",
    "[ fig : pdfs_k ] and [ fig : pdfs - real ] put into evidence a remarkable qualitative similarity between real and simulated distributions producing log - normal shapes .",
    "the shape for small values of @xmath19 is also similar .",
    "once service users have access to the reviews of any other user , the underlying network is expected to be similar to a random graph with relatively high connectivity .",
    "since purely random ( mean - field ) interactions would lead to consensus , which is not observed in empirical data , one concludes that the underlying network must have some structure .",
    "the absence of a fat tail , related to the presence of hubs , as in ba networks , indicates that the empirical cases are best modeled by er networks , at least qualitatively . in fact , in a `` rating network '' , reviews are equivalent and none of them is expected to act as a hub , then , it is reasonable that er networks yield more realistic results in this case .",
    "we introduced a model based on a plurality rule , that mimics decision making governed by the influence of the relative majority of the neighbors .",
    "the model also incorporates the possibility of undecided agents .",
    "it applies not only to situations involving consume of products or services but also to other environments where there is a variety of options , as far as the options are homogeneous with similar attractiveness ( similar quality , cost , etc . )",
    "and people have no preferred choice a priori .",
    "different final steady states emerge from the dynamics , depending on the number of available options and on the degree distribution of the network of contacts : consensus , wide distribution of opinions or also situations where indecision dominates for sufficiently large number of options .",
    "in fact , decision making governed by the plurality rule may yield ties ( conflict and frustration ) , contributing to overchoice stagnation .",
    "this effect appears to be mitigated in ba networks .",
    "the model envisages that stagnation may result not only from overchoice but also from the excess of links ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : connectivity].a ) .    for both types of small - world networks ,",
    "consensus is almost certain for sufficiently low number of options and sufficiently large connectivity . for er networks",
    ", consensus can occur even if there are many options available . if neighbors are random , consensus is the rule .",
    "but consensus is unlikely for large number of options and low network connectivity , specially if the network is homogeneous . in the square lattice with periodic boundary conditions consensus",
    "is not reached , but opinions tend to be equipartitioned . in small - world networks , there are nontrivial non - consensus regimes , and a broad distribution of opinions can emerge , with a shape similar to that of real ones when the assumptions of homogeneity hold , like in the examples of netshoes and google music albums .",
    "the model indicates that consensus can suddenly emerge simply by introducing a few connections or eliminating a few items .",
    "furthermore , it also predicts that an item can become very popular ( with relatively large @xmath117 ) , even if the initial attractiveness of all the items is uniform .",
    "these observations furnish another possible explanation of why there is so much amateur content viralizing in the internet , or why a service , good or cultural product can become a bestseller without having any apparent differentiated attractiveness .",
