    "parton - parton scattering via qcd interactions is the main process at hadron colliders . besides their intrinsic interest ,",
    "these processes represent sometimes an irreducible background to other standard model ( sm ) processes and to new physics .",
    "the @xmath2 collider hera , which provides a simple hadronic enviroment to test qcd , and the @xmath3 collider tevatron , which provides the highest available energies , have produced over the years complementary precision measurements of the parameters of the theory and precise tests of its underlying dynamics .",
    "all this knowledge will be crucial for understanding any physics at lhc .",
    "for instance , the gluon density at low @xmath4 is a necessary input ingredient for calculating the higgs production cross section , whereas the predictions for @xmath0 or @xmath1 bosons production cross sections require knowledge of the quark densities .",
    "this report summarises the most recent results from jet cross sections , forward jets , photons and @xmath0 and @xmath1 bosons and the underlying event presented by the cdf , d , h1 and zeus experiments at ichep08 .",
    "the main experimental uncertainties for jet cross sections arise from the jet energy scale and the underlying event ( ue ) , which contributes with additional energy density on top of the hard interaction but is not related to it ; this is a non - perturbative effect which is not included in the calculations .",
    "these effects can be simulated with monte carlo simulations and are extremely model dependent , so a good understanding of the ue at the available energies is crucial to model its effects at lhc energies .",
    "the cdf collaboration has performed a new study of the ue using drell - yan processes  @xcite . in this analysis ,",
    "all particles in the final state , except the lepton pair , can be considered as the ue .",
    "thus , the drell - yan events constitute a very clean probe of the ue .",
    "the study of the ue observables was done for lepton - pair masses around that of the z boson ( @xmath5 gev ) .",
    "the transverse plane was separated in four regions : the toward region , which corresponds to the z - boson direction , the opposite direction , which is called the away region , and the two transverse regions .",
    "the transverse regions are most sensitive to the ue .",
    "several observables , such as the charged particle density shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , were studied as functions of the transverse momentum of the lepton pair .",
    "the measurements are approximately constant for the transverse and toward regions and increase with lepton - pair @xmath6 in the away region .",
    "the pythia tune aw mc predictions describe very well the data .",
    "figure  [ fig2]b shows the comparison of the ue observables in drell - yan events with the same observable for the leading - jet analysis in the transverse region .",
    "the results are in good agreement so the drell - yan studies provide insight into the ue in a cleaner environment .",

    "the observable @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the jet transverse energy , @xmath9 is the jet pseudorapidity and @xmath10 is the energy of the incoming photon , measures the fraction of the photon energy invested in the hard interaction and can be used to separate both contributions since direct processes take high values of @xmath11 , whereas resolved processes take smaller values .",
