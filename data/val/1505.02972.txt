    "after the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe from the observations on distant type ia supernovae  @xcite , among the biggest puzzles in cosmology is the identity of dark energy , the `` driving force '' of the acceleration that occupies about 68% of the energy budget of the present universe  @xcite .",
    "the simplest possibility is a small but non - vanishing cosmological constant  @xcite , whose right amount would be then explained possibly by some unknown symmetry of quantum gravity or anthropic principle based on the landscape of vacua .",
    "dynamical alternatives are non - trivial scalar fields such as galileon  @xcite , or modification of gravity like massive gravity  @xcite or @xmath7 theories  @xcite .    while the identity of dark energy has a variety of theoretical origins , its properties are constrained by observations  @xcite , from which we understand how dark energy has influenced the history of the universe : at very early times , for example when the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) was generated , dark energy was completely negligible . at later stage when non - linearities in cosmic structure are developed , dark energy becomes significant and affects the evolution of gravitational instability .",
    "therefore , the effects of dark energy should emerge more prominently at non - linear level .",
    "possible signatures of dark energy in non - linear cosmic structure can be measured with more accurate data from large scale galaxy surveys into deeper redshift in near future such as hetdex  @xcite , desi  @xcite , lsst  @xcite and euclid  @xcite , which are to probe very large volume comparable to the horizon scale .",
    "this also demands fully general relativistic approaches beyond the newtonian theory .    in this article , we study how homogeneous dark energy with a time - varying equation of state modifies non - linear matter power spectrum in the comoving gauge . the same topic was studied in the newtonian perturbation theory but the effects of general dark energy are totally insignificant  @xcite ; see also  @xcite .",
    "we find that in the presence of dynamical dark energy the next - to - leading corrections to the power spectrum can give rise to a deviation as large as a few percent from both the non - linear power spectrum in @xmath0cdm and the counterpart in the einstein - de sitter ( eds ) universe at scales close to the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) ; meanwhile the power spectrum in @xmath0cdm is almost identical to that in the eds universe with less than @xmath8 difference .",
    "this notable difference between the power spectrum in fully general relativistic context and the corresponding counterpart in the eds universe , which is usually taken in the newtonian theory , is thus a sharp feature of general dark energy models . for the power spectrum in the redshift space which is directly observable ,",
    "the deviation becomes more prominent .",
    "at bao scales the deviation from @xmath0cdm reaches about @xmath1 or so .",
    "we also investigate how the homogenous dark energy affects the pure relativistic contributions coming from the curvature perturbation , which is heavily suppressed in the eds universe  @xcite .",
    "the curvature effects decrease more than @xmath9 from the eds case in the presence of dark energy , including a cosmological constant , while their contribution is not significant at all .",
    "we consider a flat friedmann - robertson - walker universe as our background .",
    "the energy density of the universe consists of pressureless matter and non - interacting dark energy , which is a good approximation for the epoch of the evolution of cosmic structure after the generation of cmb until now .",
    "furthermore , to simplify the analysis , we assume that dark energy is so homogeneously distributed that its perturbation is negligible .",
    "that is , dark energy contributes only to background ; see however  @xcite for possible significance of dark energy perturbation . to fix the coordinate system ,",
    "we choose the comoving gauge where @xmath10 with the spatial metric @xmath11 . here , @xmath12 is the conformal time .",
    "note that the governing equations in the comoving gauge is known to coincide exactly with the newtonian hydrodynamic equations up to second order in a zero pressure fluid  @xcite .",
    "this is , however , not the case when we consider dark energy , because of the pressure associated with dark energy which plays a genuine relativistic role even at background level  @xcite .",
    "for example , the energy conservation equation has an additional contribution @xmath13 here , @xmath14 is the perturbation in the extrinsic curvature , an overbar means background , and @xmath15 is the equation of state of dark energy .",
    "@xmath16 is thus an indicator of the effects of dark energy and is a key parameter in this work .",
    "note that it vanishes in both eds universe and @xmath0cdm .",
    "the equation for the matter density contrast @xmath17 is then obtained by combining the energy conservation and raychaudhuri equations as @xmath18 where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to the conformal time and @xmath19 .",
    "note that on the left hand side , where we have placed linear terms , we find new contributions with @xmath16 that are absent in the conventional newtonian perturbation theory .",
    "the terms on the right hand side are non - linear sources : @xmath20 denotes the non - linear newtonian source  @xcite , and the pure relativistic effect @xmath21 originates from the curvature perturbation @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "the remaining two terms , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , represent respectively the evolution of @xmath22 and the departure from @xmath0cdm and eds , and are given by @xmath25 + \\frac{\\lambda}{1-\\lambda } \\left ( \\frac{4}{3}\\delta'{}^2 + \\delta''\\delta + { \\mathcal{h}}\\delta'\\delta \\right ) + \\frac{2\\lambda'}{(1-\\lambda)^2}\\delta'\\delta - \\frac{\\lambda'}{1-\\lambda}\\delta^{,i}\\beta,_i \\nonumber\\\\ & \\quad + \\frac{\\lambda}{1-\\lambda } \\left ( \\delta\\delta^{,i}\\beta_{,i } ' + \\frac{8}{3}\\delta'\\delta^{,i}\\beta_{,i } + 2\\delta\\delta_{,i}'\\beta^{,i } + { \\mathcal{h}}\\delta\\delta^{,i}\\beta_{,i } \\right ) - \\frac{\\lambda(2-\\lambda)}{(1-\\lambda)^2 } \\left ( \\frac{8}{3}\\delta'{}^2\\delta + \\delta''\\delta^2 + { \\mathcal{h}}\\delta'\\delta^2 \\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & \\quad - \\lambda \\left [ -\\frac{2}{3}\\delta\\beta\\delta\\beta_r + 2\\beta_{,ij}\\beta_r^{,ij } - 4\\varphi\\beta^{,ij}\\beta_{,ij } + \\frac{4}{3}\\varphi(\\delta\\beta)^2 + \\frac{4}{3}\\varphi_{,i}\\beta^{,i}\\delta\\beta - 4\\varphi_{,i}\\beta_{,j}\\beta^{,ij } \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & \\quad + \\frac{2\\lambda'}{(1-\\lambda)^2}\\delta\\delta^{,i}\\beta_{,i } - \\frac{3\\lambda'}{(1-\\lambda)^3}\\delta'\\delta^2 + \\frac{\\lambda'}{1-\\lambda}\\left ( 2\\varphi\\delta^{,i}\\beta_{,i } - \\delta_{,i}\\beta_r^{,i } \\right)\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 . here",
    ", @xmath27 is the scalar perturbation in the @xmath28 component of the metric given by @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the spatial laplacian and @xmath31 is the inverse laplacian operator .",
    "it is important to note that while the effects of the curvature perturbation appear only from third order  @xcite , general dark energy modifies the equation from linear order as can be seen from and .",
    "this is because dark energy changes the background expansion rate and thus its effects permeate throughout all order in perturbation .    at linear order",
    ", the solution of the curvature perturbation @xmath22 can be found as @xmath32 \\delta^{-1}\\delta \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the linear growth function . in the eds universe ,",
    "the expansion rate of universe is same as the inhomogeneity growth rate at linear order : @xmath35 so that @xmath36 is constant . therefore , @xmath22 is time - independent in the eds universe . similar conclusion of a constant @xmath22 can be drawn in @xmath0cdm .",
    "on the other hands , @xmath22 decreases when we consider general dark energy because of the faster expansion rate and slower growth of inhomogeneity .",
    "thus , @xmath37 also indicates the effects of general dark energy .",
    "to compute the power spectrum perturbatively , we expand the density and velocity divergence perturbations as @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the second and third order solutions are found in terms of the @xmath40-th order symmetric kernels @xmath41 along with time - dependent coefficients as @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the superscript @xmath22 means originated from @xmath22 .",
    "the solutions for @xmath46 have exactly the same form as @xmath47 , while the time - dependent coefficients are replaced by @xmath48 with @xmath49 being @xmath50-th growth function of @xmath51 . in the eds universe ,",
    "the coefficients are fixed as certain numbers : @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "since the universe is close to eds when @xmath67 begins to grow , these numbers are set to be the initial conditions for these coefficients and we evolve them .",
    "note that in @xmath68 , unlike @xmath22 , we can not separate the contributions originated from @xmath16 because as stated in the previous section dark energy changes the background expansion rate . also note that the contribution from @xmath22 carries @xmath69 , which can be identified as the comoving horizon scale @xmath70 .",
    "the non - linear power spectrum is defined by @xmath71 . under the perturbative expansion of @xmath67 ,",

    "we can note that the power spectrum for @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) in the left panel and @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) in the right panel is smaller ( larger ) than that in @xmath0cdm . since we normalize @xmath107 as the planck 2015 best - fit value , the energy density of dark energy increases ( decreases )",

    "thus the matter - dark energy equality is later for @xmath108 than for @xmath109 , although the expansion rate for @xmath108 is faster than that for @xmath109 at present . as a result",
    ", the inhomogeneity can grow more for @xmath108 than @xmath109 .",
    "usually , one uses the non - linear power spectrum in the eds universe to an arbitrary cosmological model by replacing the scale factor with the linear growth factor of that model , while leaving the time - independent part of the spectrum identical to the eds one : @xmath110_\\text{eds } \\ , .\\ ] ] compared with the _ true _ power spectrum , this is obviously inconsistent because in general dark energy models the non - linear kernels @xmath111 s as well as the time - dependent coefficients @xmath112 s of the non - linear solutions are different from the eds counterparts . in figure",
    "[ fig : eds ] , we compare the power spectra for different dark energy models with the corresponding counter eds power spectra . as in figure  [ fig : lcdm ] , in the left ( right ) panel we fix @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) and vary @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "the top panels show the total power spectra , while in the bottom panel the relative differences of the dark energy models from the corresponding eds counterparts are presented .",

    "general dark energy differs substantially from the eds counterpart because of the large @xmath24 contribution : the relative difference notably increases from @xmath114/mpc and becomes larger than 10% for @xmath115/mpc . while even larger deviations on smaller scales may not be reliable because of strong non - linear effects , the analytic non - linear power spectrum gives very good agreement with numerical simulations in weakly non - linear regime  @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to take a closer look at @xmath86 . in the top panels of figure  [ fig : lcdm ] ,",
    "we separately show @xmath86 for different dark energy models .",
    "while @xmath75 contributes more significantly on smaller scales @xmath116/mpc , @xmath86 extends to larger scales .",
    "furthermore , even for @xmath0cdm the relative difference from the counter eds power spectrum is larger than @xmath9 , i.e. always smaller in the presence of any form of dark energy on all scales .",
    "thus , @xmath86 is strongly influenced by dark energy and is in principle interesting , but its magnitude is heavily suppressed .",
    "the power spectrum presented in the previous section is computed in the real space . in reality , however , we identify the position in terms of redshift . thus to extract observational prospect , we need to consider the power spectrum in the redshift space which is directly related to observations .",
    "the proper transformation from the real space to the redshift space includes all relativistic effects such as gravitational lensing and the sachs - wolfe effects .",
    "note that although the real space solutions in the previous section are _ not _ gauge - invariant , those in the redshift space obtained from this transformation are gauge - invariant  @xcite . in this article",
    ", we take into account only the doppler effect , because the other relativistic effects are suppressed at the bao scales in which we are interested  @xcite .",
