    "however , baryons and mesons are created in nearly equal proportion ( 1:1 ) . at this same @xmath0 ,",

    "the enhancement persists up to @xmath5  gev / c .",
    "this effect is generic to many systems ; baryon production is enhanced in systems that yield larger multiplicity and have the potential for an increase in multi - parton effects .",

    ". they also relate hadronic observables to a pre - hadronic stage of interacting quarks and gluons . as such",
    ", they touch on questions central to the heavy - ion physics program : deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration . given the potential physics benefits that can be derived from these measurements , experimentalists at rhic and sps",
    "have endeavored to extend their abilities to identify hadron types up to higher @xmath0 regions  @xcite . here",
    "i review those measurements which provide evidence for active quark and gluon degrees - of - freedom and discuss implications of the baryon enhancement on pion and non - photonic electron spectra .",

    "the right panel shows the @xmath8 ratio for p+p , mid - peripheral au+au , and central au+au collisions scaled by 0.5  @xcite . in central au+au collisions , @xmath6 reaches a maximum value of nearly 1 at @xmath9  gev / c .",

    "@xcite predict that the @xmath0 value where the @xmath10 ratio is at its maximum will increase with collision centrality .",

    "baryon production is also enhanced in @xmath12  gev @xmath7 collisions when @xmath13 events are compared to continuum @xmath14 events  @xcite . from those measurements",
    "the question arose : _ is the enhancement related to multi - parton topological effects or a difference between quark and gluon fragmentation ? _",
    "since @xmath15 is a purely gluonic process , the observation that the @xmath6 ratio is even larger in au+au collisions indicates that multi - parton topological effects drive the enhancement ( baryon junctions or coalescence ) .",
    "@xmath4 is a sensitive measure to distinguish between possible interpretations of the hadron type dependence of particle spectra .",
    "figure  [ v2 ] shows preliminary measurements of @xmath4 with a minimum bias centrality selection in au+au collisions at @xmath16  gev  @xcite .",
    "the curves show @xmath4 for pions , kaons , protons and @xmath17s from a hydrodynamic calculation  @xcite . at @xmath18",

    "calculations suggest that @xmath4 from this mechanism should be less than 10%  @xcite .",
    "it is also expected that all hadrons will have similar @xmath4 values where partonic energy loss is the dominant source of @xmath4 .",
    "the magnitude and particle - type dependence of @xmath4 seen for @xmath19  gev / c suggests that other mechanisms contribute to the development of @xmath4 up to 67 gev / c .",
    "this observation is consistent with results from a parton cascade model predicting that the effects of flow may persist up to @xmath20  gev / c  @xcite . at @xmath20",
    "gev / c , within errors , the particle - type dependence of @xmath4 disappears and the @xmath4 measurements are consistent with expectations from energy loss models  @xcite .",
    "hadronization by coalescence or recombination of constituent quarks is thought to explain many features of hadron production in the intermediate @xmath0 region ( @xmath2  gev / c )  @xcite .",
    "these models find that at intermediate @xmath0 , @xmath4 may follow a quark - number ( @xmath21 ) scaling with @xmath22 for all hadrons falling on one curve .",
    "this scaling behavior has been observed in au+au collisions at 200 gev  @xcite .",
    "more sophisticated theoretical considerations have led to predictions of fine structure in quark - number scaling  with predictions for a baryon @xmath23 being smaller than meson @xmath23  @xcite .",

    "the deviations from the scaling are shown in the bottom panel by plotting the difference between the scaled baryon @xmath4 and the scaled meson @xmath4 divided by the sum @xmath24 .",
    "theoretical predictions for this value are also shown .",
    "the model that compares best to data is a coalescence model that includes the effect of quark momentum distributions inside the hadron ( _ coalescence + wavefunction _ )  @xcite .",

    "@xcite leads to a negative @xmath24 ratio but with a smaller magnitude than observed in the data .",
    "the hadron / string model urqmd yields @xmath4 values smaller by a factor of two than experimental data .",
    "the model does , however , find a scaling with quark number . in this model",
    "the scaling originates from the additive quark model for hadronic cross - sections .",
    "it should be noted , when considering comparisons to any models , that the systematic uncertainties on these preliminary measurements have not yet been specified .",
    "quark - number dependences at intermediate @xmath0 are also manifested in the centrality dependence of the @xmath0 spectra .",
    "figure  [ rcp ] shows the ratios @xmath25  @xcite ( central au+au over peripheral au+au ) in the left panel and @xmath26  @xcite ( au+au over p+p ) in the right panel where the spectra have been scaled by the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions ( @xmath27 ) . for @xmath28  gev / c",
    ", @xmath25 values are grouped by hadron type ( mesons vs. baryons ) .",
    "the larger baryon @xmath25 values indicate that baryon production increases more quickly with centrality than meson production .",
    "this observation is confirmed with good precision for protons and hyperons .",
    "the @xmath29 is a particularly interesting test particle since it is a meson but is more massive than the proton . with good precision , the @xmath29",
    "is now confirmed to follow the systematics of the other mesons .",
    "measurement of @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xmath25 at @xmath32  gev indicate that baryon production is also enhanced at lower center - of - mass energies  @xcite : with @xmath31 @xmath25 values well above @xmath27 scaling .",
    "the difference between @xmath31 @xmath25 and @xmath30 @xmath25 is similar at all energies .",
    "this similarity is surprising since the underlying shape of the spectrum is changing very drastically with @xmath33 , becoming much steeper at higher energies .",
    "it remains to be seen if any of the current theoretical interpretations of the baryon enhancement can explain this lack of energy dependence in the relative enhancement of baryons .",
    "if the baryon enhancement also exists for charm hadrons , then the non - photonic electron spectrum may be affected  @xcite .",
    "the branching ratio for @xmath34  +  _ anything _",
    "( 4.5% @xmath35 1.7% ) is smaller than that for @xmath36  +  _ anything _ ( 17.2% @xmath35 1.9% ) or @xmath37  +  _ anything _ ( 6.87% @xmath35 0.28% )  @xcite . in this case , even if charm quark production is unchanged , increasing the @xmath38 ratio will lead to a reduction in the number of observed non - photonic electrons . in fig .",
    "[ lc ] ( left ) we show the effect of a @xmath39 enhancement on the charm decay electron spectrum .",
    "the ratio of two cases is taken : @xmath40 follows the shape of the @xmath8 ratio in au+au collisions , or it follows the shape of the @xmath8 ratio in p+p collisions .",
    "a suppression of electrons from heavy flavor decays due to the larger charm baryon - to - meson ratio in au+au collisions is visible .",
    "the suppression in this figure is a result of smaller @xmath41  +  _ anything _ branching ratio .",
    "the different curves show the experimental uncertainties on the branching ratio  @xcite .",
    "the figure demonstrates that even if the total charm yield follows @xmath27 scaling , the non - photonic electron spectrum can be suppressed .",
    "the magnitude of the suppression depends on the @xmath38 ratio and the @xmath42  +  _ anything _ branching ratio .",
    "the @xmath38 ratio in au+au collisions is unknown but for the charm baryon - to - meson ratio assumed here , the suppression can be as large as 20% . in fig .",
    "[ lc ] ( right ) we show the case when charm @xmath26 follows light quark @xmath26 and @xmath43 is enhanced .",
    "the non - photonic electron data are above the resulting non - photonic electron curve . if we scale the input charm @xmath26 up and calculate the @xmath44 , we find the smallest @xmath44 value for charm quark @xmath45 charged hadron @xmath26 .",
    "it has been proposed that the large @xmath10 values at rhic may be a result of the suppression of pion production coupled with novel baryon production mechanisms scaling with @xmath27 or @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "the lower energy measurements call this interpretation into question since baryon production is still enhanced even while the suppression of mesons is much weaker . furthermore , it is possible that part of the pion suppression is actually a manifestation of the baryon enhancement .",
    "most baryons do not decay into pions while many meson resonances do .",
    "if the relative fraction of baryons is increasing with centrality , then that should lead to an absence of pions from decays .",
    "much of the difference between kaon and pion @xmath26  @xcite may be caused by this effect : an effect exactly analogous to that described in the previous section on non - photonic electrons .",
    "pion , kaon , proton , and hyperon momentum - space distributions have been measured up to @xmath47  gev / c .",
    "several observations indicate that at @xmath48 gev / c , hard processes may dominate particle production . below this",
    ", measurements of the @xmath10 ratios , @xmath25 , and @xmath4 indicate that processes beyond the reach of perturbative qcd are prevalent .",
    "the baryon enhancement at intermediate @xmath0 is seen to be generic to many systems and appears to be correlated with higher multiplicity .",
    "measurements favor pictures involving multi - parton dynamics and point to the presence of active quark and gluon degrees - of - freedom .",
    "a baryon enhancement in the charm sector is shown to potentially impact the interpretation of non - photonic electron @xmath26 .",
    "for the scenario presented we find that preliminary non - photonic electron @xmath26 data prefer a charm quark @xmath26 35% larger than light quark @xmath26 .",
    "we also note that the baryon enhancement may lead to an extra suppression of pions due to the reduction in the number of pions from resonance decays when baryon production becomes preferred .",
