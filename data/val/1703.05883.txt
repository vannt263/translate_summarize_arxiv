    "the lower panel of fig  [ fig : wings ] shows a soft band x - ray projection of m89 that demonstrates how turbulent stripping can create wings of diffuse gas to the sides of the galaxy , as we observe for m60 .",
    "the size of the wings scales with the size of the gas atmosphere , hence larger wings are seen in m60 , compared to the simulations of the virgo elliptical m89 , since most of m89 s gas has already been stripped .",
    "the double wing structure is seen in the simulation image ( fig  [ fig : wings ] lower panel ) .",
    "the wings are attached directly to the sides of the galaxy as is the case for m60 , another indicator of motion nearly in the plane of the sky .",
    "this can also be explained by the inclination angle ; the simulations assume motion purely in the plane of the sky , while m60 has an inclination of @xmath170 degrees as shown in  [ sec : m60infall ] .",
    "for m89 these features are attached to the upstream edge rather than to the sides ( machacek et  al .",
    "thus the simulation better represents m60 in this instance .",
    "two processes can disturb the sharp - edge of a cold front ; rayleigh - taylor instabilities and kelvin - helmholtz ( khi ) instabilities ( roediger et  al .",
    "the rayleigh - taylor instability occurs when two fluids of different densities are accelerated into each other .",
    "the galaxy gas is accelerating into the icm , but the rayleigh - taylor instability is suppressed by m60 s gravity , so that the effective acceleration points in the opposite direction .",
    "khi instabilities , formed at the surface of the cold front edge where velocity shears may produce turbulent motions , are likely the cause of the filamentary wings seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : soft ] and [ fig : wings ] , perhaps aided by previous agn outbursts that may have lifted the galaxy gas upward in m60 s gravitational potential making it easier to strip .",
    "the simulations predict some faint emission behind the wings downstream leading to a diffuse tail trailing the galaxy .",
    "there is a faint excess of emission seen for @xmath171kpc in the eastern surface brightness profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig : profcompare ] ) over that observed in the northern or western profiles , suggestive of such a tail .    the simulations of m89 predict a downstream edge marking the boundary between the galaxy atmosphere and diffuse tail .",
    "we performed our edge analysis as outlined in ",
    "[ sec : sbproffit ] , on the eastern profile of m60 to look for this downstream edge ( see figs . [",

    "vertical lines denote the edge locations for the upstream northern profile ( black dashes ) and the eastern downstream tail ( blue dot - dashed).,height=3 ]    using the power law model from eq .",
    "[ eq : densmod ] , the eastern profile is well fit with upstream and downstream power law slopes of @xmath172 and @xmath173 , respectively .",
    "we find a small jump @xmath174 at @xmath175kpc downstream from the center of m60 .",
    "since we expect from simulations that the near tail is composed of galaxy gas displaced but not yet completely stripped from m60 ( roediger etal 2015a ) , the abundance across the eastern edges should be the same .",
    "thus @xmath176 , the ratio of the gas density across the eastern downstream edge .",
    "fig  [ fig : tailcompare ] shows the extracted surface brightness profiles for both the upstream ( northern cold front ) and downstream ( eastern tail ) edges .",
    "the simulations generally find the downstream edge at a larger radius than the upstream edge , even more so than is observed for m60 .",
    "the surface brightness profiles are symmetric in both radial directions until each respective edge . in the simulations of m89 ,",
    "the upstream edge of the cold front and wings look sharper than the downstream edge , consistent with what we see in fig  [ fig : tailcompare ] .",
    "there are several factors that could keep the tail of m60 faint . a steep initial gas density profile for m60 would mean there was less gas to strip at larger radii and",
    "the stripped gas may mix quickly with the surrounding icm .",
    "the large distance of m60 from m87 ( @xmath177kpc ) and the galaxy velocity of @xmath178kms@xmath11suggest multiple possibilities .",
    "first , we could be witnessing the very early stages of the m60-virgo interaction , thus sufficient gas has not yet been stripped to form a clear tail as observed in m89 , which is located far closer to m87 ( @xmath179kpc ) and therefore has undergone a much longer gas stripping period .",
    "alternatively , m60 may already have passed through the virgo system once and we are observing it shortly upon completing a turn around in its orbit .",
    "this would suggest stripping is occurring primarily from khi , such that no large volumes of gas are being pushed behind the galaxy . in either case , stripping may be less efficient in the low density virgo outskirts , requiring gas to first be uplifted by periodic agn activity before being pushed back into the tail .",
    "using archival data from the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory ( total cleaned exposure time @xmath24ks ) , we identified a surface brightness discontinuity ( edge ) @xmath180kpc from the center of m60 to the north and west in the direction on m87 , the virgo cluster center .",
    "the surface brightness edge is produced by the ram pressure stripping of the gas in m60 as it passes through the virgo icm . from the surface brightness profile , taken to the north to minimize instrumental effects and maximize radial distance coverage , we measured gas temperatures within the edge in m60 , in the virgo gas pile - up region ( @xmath181 ) immediately outside the edge , and in the virgo free stream region ( @xmath182kpc ) , and measured the density ratio between gas inside the edge and in the virgo free stream region to determine the physical motion of the elliptical galaxy m60 through the virgo icm .",
    "we find :    * x - ray emission in m60 is gas dominated and well fit in the mean by a vapec spectral model with @xmath183kev and fe , o , mg , and si abundance of @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath98 , and @xmath186 , respectively",
    ". *   fixing the abundance inside the edge at @xmath3 consistent with m60 s mean results and at @xmath5 for virgo gas at @xmath187mpc from the literature , gas temperatures along the northern profile for galaxy gas inside the edge , in the pile - up region , and in the virgo free stream region are @xmath188kev , @xmath127kev , and @xmath4kev , respectively .",
    "* the leading ( northern ) edge at @xmath189kpc from the galaxy center , coincides with a jump in density of @xmath190 between gas inside the edge and virgo gas in the free stream region . *",
    "the measured pressure ratio @xmath191 between galaxy gas inside the edge and in the virgo free stream region implies m60 is infalling with total velocity @xmath10kms@xmath11 ( mach @xmath192 ) relative to the virgo icm .",
    "given the relative radial velocity of @xmath193 , this yields an inclination angle @xmath162degrees with respect to the plane of the sky , consistent with the observed sharp surface brightness edge .",
    "m60 s inferred transverse infall velocity , @xmath161kms@xmath11 , places an upper bound on the time to pericenter passage of @xmath194 gyr .",
    "* extended wing - like features are observed to the northeast and south of m60 . comparison of these features with simulations of ram - pressure stripping suggests that these wings are likely produced by kelvin - helmholtz instabilities caused by m60 s motion through a nearly inviscid virgo icm . the thin and long filamentary gas wings scale with the size of the gas atmosphere and",
    "are attached directly to the sides of m60 , an indicator of motion in the plane of the sky , consistent with the small measured inclination angle .",
    "* excess emission observed to the east ( downstream ) of m60 s motion and confirmed in the eastern surface brightness profile is consistent with the existence of a faint , diffuse tail , similar to those seen in simulations of ram pressure stripping .",
    "the faintness of the tail is due either to insufficient stripping of the gas due to m60 s distance from the cluster core , or because we are observing m60 shortly after completing a turn - around of its orbit .",
