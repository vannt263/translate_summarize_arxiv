    "muon beams are customarily obtained via @xmath0 decays produced in proton interaction on target .",
    "their use in high energy physics experiments has a continuous increasing interest for rare decays searches , precision measurement experiments , neutrino physics and for muon colliders feasibility studies .",
    "several dedicated experiments are ongoing to produce high intensity muon beams with low emittance . in this paper",
    "we will investigate the possibility to produce low emittance muon beams from a novel approach , using the electron - positron collisions at centre - of - mass energy just above the @xmath1 production threshold with maximal beam energy asymmetry , that corresponds to about 45 gev positron beam interacting on an electron target .",
    "previous studies on this subject are reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . our proposal is simpler with respect to present conventional projects where muons are produced by a proton source .",
    "one important aspect is that in our proposal muon cooling would not be necessary .",
    "the most important key properties of the muons produced by the positrons on target are :    * the low and tunable muon momentum in the centre of mass frame * large boost , being about @xmath2200 .",
    "these characteristic results in the following advantages :    * the final state muons are highly collimated and have small emittance ; * the muons have an average laboratory lifetime of about 500 @xmath3s .    in the section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we describe the main processes at the energy of interest . in section two",
    "we describe the key issue of the options on the target .",
    "the value of the @xmath4 cross section is of about 1 @xmath3b just above threshold , requiring a target with very high electron density to obtain a reasonable muon production efficiency .",
    "we estimate the requirement on the electron density on the target above @xmath5 electrons/@xmath6 .",
    "such high - density values can be obtained either in a liquid or solid target or , possibly , in a more exotic solution like in crystals .",
    "we discuss the solid target solution and the crystals .",
    "also a plasma excited via a syncronized electron beam could be a solution . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we discuss our first estimates that show how this option does not seem practicable .",
    "however , we think that that further studies are worth to be performed on this option",
    ". studies of the positron source will be reviewed in section [ sec:4 ] , followed , in section [ sec:5 ] , by the schemes of the muon production .",
    "finally , in section [ sec:6 ] , rate and beam properties estimates for muon collider that can be obtained with our proposal are given .",
    "we conclude with a proposal for a design study , especially for the key innovative aspects that need to be investigated .",
    "the dominant processes at @xmath7 around 0.212 gev are mainly three :    1 .",
    "@xmath4 : @xmath1 production 2 .",
    "@xmath8 : bhabha scattering 3 .",
    "@xmath9 scattering .",
    "our goal is to maximize the muons production and muon beam parameters . in the following sub - section [ subsec:2.1 ] we analyse their dependencies and features .",
    "the second and third process are instead side effect that reduce the efficiency of the first one .",
    "we will discuss in the sub - section [ subsec:2.2 ] the second process .",
    "they have been simulated with the ` babayaga ` event generator @xcite with the exception of the collinear radiative bhabha scattering , for which we used ` bbbrem ` @xcite .",
    "the last process , the @xmath9 scattering , will not be discussed in detail , having a cross section that is smaller than that for the @xmath1 production .",
    "we note that , if needed , the method proposed here for the muons production could also allow the production of high energy collimated photons .",
    "we discuss here the dependencies that can maximize the muons production and at the same time also minimize the muon bunch emittance and energy spread , when required .",
    "the main parameters that play a role are : the dependence of the scattering angle distribution of the outgoing muons , the muons energy distribution and the cross section on the centre - of - mass energy .",
    "the cross section for continuum muon pair production @xmath4 just above threshold is obtained using the born cross section , enhanced by the sommerfeld - schwinger - sakharov ( sss ) threshold coulomb resummation factor @xcite .",
    "the value of this cross section is shown in figure  [ fig : xsec ] as a function of the centre - of - mass energy . in this figure",
    "we see that the cross section approaches its maximum value of about 1@xmath3b at @xmath100.230 gev .     of the @xmath11 collisions .",
    "[ fig : xsec ] ]    in our proposal these values of @xmath7 can be obtained from fixed target interactions with a positrons beam energy of @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the electron mass , with a boost of @xmath14 .",
    "the scattering angle of the outcoming muons @xmath15 is maximum for the muons emitted orthogonally to positron beam ( in the rest frame ) and its value depends on @xmath7 ( see figure  [ fig : muang ] ) .     of the @xmath11 collisions .",
    "[ fig : muang ] ]    in the approximation of @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the muons velocity , one can easily obtain for the maximum scattering angle : @xmath18    the value of the scattering angle @xmath15 increases with the @xmath7 with approximately the same shape as the cross section of the @xmath1 production .",
    "the difference between the maximum and the minimum energy of the muons produced at the positron target ( @xmath19 ) also depends on @xmath7 , and with the @xmath16 approximation we get : @xmath20    these values have to be folded with the muons angular distribution in the rest frame , that is : @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the muon scattering angle in the rest frame .",
    "the value of @xmath7 has to be optimized to maximize the @xmath1 production and to minimize the beam angular divergence and eventually the energy spread .",
    "the @xmath15 distribution obtained with the ` babayaga ` generator is shown in figure  [ fig : muang ] for different @xmath7 values .",
    "muons produced with very small momentum in the rest frame are well contained in a cone of about @xmath23 rad for @xmath7=0.212 gev , the cone size increases to @xmath24 rad at @xmath7=0.220 gev .",
    "similarly , the energy distribution of the muons , as shown in figure  [ fig : muene ] , has an @xmath25 that increases with @xmath7 , from about 1 gev at @xmath7=0.212 gev to  3 gev at @xmath7=0.220 gev",
    ". the muons beam energy has the typical correlation with the muons emission angle as shown in figure  [ fig : mu_scatvale ] for @xmath7=0.214 gev .    .",
    "[ fig : muene ] ]    another solution in principle could be to produce the muonium below the @xmath1 threshold that can be eventually dissociated in the interaction with the medium .",
    "it has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is shown that the @xmath11 width is proportional to 1/n where n indicates the muonium energy level .",
    "the cross section for the @xmath26 state in the narrow width approximation is about : @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the positrons beam energy spread .",
    "this value implies that the use of this process for copious muons production is not realistic .",
    "= 0.214 gev case [ fig : mu_scatvale ] ]      the bhabha scattering represents the largest source of beam loss in this study , setting an upper limit on the muons production from positrons on target .",
    "the large angle case has been simulated in the rest frame using babayaga with radiative photons energy , @xmath2910 mev , and a scattering angle @xmath30 .",
    "the total cross section in the region of @xmath31 0.2 gev is @xmath32 as expected , the process proceeds via t - channel and most of the generated events are produced at a very small positrons scattering angle @xmath33 .",
    "figure  [ fig : angvsscatenepos ] shows the distribution of the outgoing positrons scattering angle as a function of the energy of the outgoing positrons , for a beam positron energy of @xmath34 gev impinging the target .",
    "[ fig : angvsscatenepos ] ]    the distribution indicates that the beam loss due to this process can be substantially decreased with reasonable acceptances .",
    "the largest part of the @xmath11 cross section comes from the collinear radiative bhabha scattering .",
    "it has been simulated with ` bbbrem`@xcite .",
    "the total cross section is about 150 mb for a @xmath35 and it gets to about 60 mb for @xmath36 .",
    "this process sets a limit to the @xmath3 pairs production , as it sets limits to the beam lifetime in high luminosity @xmath11 colliders .",
    "the number of @xmath1 pairs produced per positron bunch on target is : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the number of positrons in the bunch , @xmath39 is the electron density in the medium , @xmath40 is the thickness of the target , and @xmath41 is the muon pairs production cross section . as described in the previous section , the dominant process at these energies is the collinear radiative bhabha scattering with a cross section of about of 150 mb actually setting the value of the positron beam interaction length for a given pure electron target density value . using as reference value for the positron beam degradation when",
    "its current is decreased by 1/@xmath42 , i.e. one beam lifetime , one can determine the maximum achievable value for the target density and length : @xmath43 the ratio of the muon pair production cross section to the radiative bhabha cross section determines the maximum value of the _ muons conversion efficiency _ @xmath44 , that can be obtained with a pure electrons target . in the following",
    "we will refer to @xmath44 defined as the ratio of the number of produced @xmath45 pair to the number of the incoming positrons .",
    "easily one can see that the upper limit of @xmath44 is of the order of @xmath46 , so that : @xmath47      the option of the plasma target has been considered and studied in some details .",
    "it is known that an enhanced electron density can be obtained at the border of the blow - out region in excited plasma .",
    "this solution provides with good approximation an ideal electron target and will also benefit from a strong and continuous beam focalization thanks to the pinch effect  @xcite .",
    "an enhancement of about @xmath48 in the number of electrons can be obtained in a region of about 100 @xmath3 m just before the blow - out , for a plasma with density of @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "the size of the electrons high density region scales as 1/@xmath50 , such that at useful positrons densities values in the order of @xmath51 ) will be reached in regions in the @xmath3 m range , making the plasma option hardly practicable .",
    "electromagnetic interactions with nuclei are dominant in conventional targets .",
    "in addition , no intrinsic focusing effects are expected in this case , thus setting limits for the target thickness to not increase the muons beam emittance @xmath52 . assuming a uniform distribution in the transverse @xmath53 plane being @xmath54 the longitudinal target coordinate and @xmath55 the smaller interaction length among all involved processes .",
    "the approximation is valid for @xmath56 . ]",
    "the emittance contribution due to the target thickness is : @xmath57 the number of @xmath45 pairs produced per crossing has the form given by the relation  [ eq : nmu ] , with @xmath58 being @xmath59 the atomic number , @xmath60 the mass number , @xmath61 the avogadro constant and @xmath62 the material density .",
    "in addition , the multiple scattering contributes to the emittance increase according to : @xmath63 with @xmath40 expressed in radiations length unit and @xmath64 the bremsstrahlung process governs the positrons beam degradation in this case and it scales with the radiation length .    on one side to minimize the emittance",
    "there is the need of a small length @xmath40 , on the other side compact materials have typically small radiation length causing an increase of the emittance due multiple scattering and fast positron beam degradation due to bremsstrahlung .",

    "an improvement in the positron rate is required for a muon collider purpose .",
    "target survival needs also deep studies . a first set of parameters for a muon collider at high energy and 125 gev has been shown to assess the potentiality of this proposal .",
