    "the study of epidemics has a long and fascinating history that dates back to daniel bernoulli who modeled the spread of smallpox @xcite .",
    "theoretical models have been quite successful in describing the spread of infectious diseases .",
    "closely related models have been applied to a truly remarkable set of contagious processes including hiv @xcite , computer viruses @xcite , spread of technological innovations @xcite , outbreaks of social and political unrest @xcite , and rumor propagation @xcite .",
    "the convenient deterministic framework is most commonly used to model the spread of an epidemic . in this formulation ,",
    "coupled ordinary differential equations describe the evolution of macroscopic properties such as the average number of infected , the average number of recovered , and so on @xcite .",
    "however , the deterministic approach can not capture fluctuations which are inevitable due to the finite size of the population .",
    "in many scenarios such as the spread of an infection in an isolated boarding school with say , a hundred children , statistical fluctuations are certainly significant .",
    "the stochastic framework which involves evolution equations for the entire probability distribution is instead required to describe finite populations @xcite .",
    "theoretical analysis of the stochastic framework is challenging , even for the most basic infection processes @xcite , and many questions concerning finite - size effects and extremal properties of the probability distribution functions remain unanswered .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the stochastic version of the classic susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) infection process . in this model ,",
    "the population consists of susceptible , infected , and recovered individuals , and the infection spreads through contact between infected and susceptible members of the community @xcite .",
    "each infected individual spreads the infection at a certain rate , denoted by @xmath0 , while infected individuals recover at a rate set to one .",
    "the epidemic threshold is @xmath1 . below the threshold ,",
    "the infection can not maintain itself ; above the threshold , the infection can take off .",
    "we focus on epidemic outbreaks at or near the threshold @xcite .",
    "such `` threshold epidemics '' are especially interesting . from a theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "the infection and the recovery processes are in some sense in perfect balance precisely at the threshold .",
    "while most infections are small , large outbreaks may occasionally happen , and hence , threshold epidemics exhibit large fluctuations . from a practical viewpoint , human efforts at disease prevention reduce the infection rate thereby driving infectious diseases from the pandemic to the endemic phase @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , natural evolution may increase the infection rate of diseases hovering just below the threshold , thereby enhancing the likelihood of an outbreak @xcite .",
    "these epidemics are subtle : they may be difficult to detect as well as difficult to control .",
    "we first consider infinite populations and focus on the behavior precisely at the epidemic threshold .",
    "we analyze the rate equation for the probability @xmath2 that the number of infected equals @xmath3 and the number of recovered equals @xmath4 at time @xmath5 .",
    "the typical number of infected grows linearly with time while the typical number of recovered grows quadratically with time .",
    "we show that the joint distribution function obeys the scaling form @xmath6 we obtain the laplace transform of the scaling function @xmath7 analytically , and present a comprehensive asymptotic analysis .",
    "we also discuss scaling properties of the respective single - population distribution functions for the number of infected or the number of removed .",
    "next , we consider finite populations .",
    "we combine the infinite population results with heuristic arguments to derive scaling laws for the size and duration of outbreaks in a finite population of size @xmath8 . at or near the epidemic threshold",
    ", the effective infection rate is reduced because the population is finite .",
    "we find that the maximal size of the outbreak , @xmath9 , and the maximal duration of the outbreak , @xmath10 , obey the nontrivial scaling laws @xmath11 we also formulate the range of infection rates near the epidemic threshold for which these scaling laws apply .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin with the definition of the infection process , given in section ii . in section iii ,",
    "we treat the infinite population limit by using the rate equation approach .",
    "first , we derive the outbreak size distribution .",
    "we then compute two single - variable distributions  the probability distribution for the number of infected individuals and the probability distribution of the number of recovered individuals .",
    "next , we discuss scaling and extremal properties of the joint distribution function . in section iv , we consider finite populations and obtain finite - size scaling laws for the size and duration of the outbreaks .",
    "we discuss the results in section v , and the appendix details some necessary inverse laplace transforms .",
    "the spread of infectious diseases has been widely studied on regular and irregular spatial structures such as lattices @xcite and complex networks @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , many characteristics of stochastic epidemics , e.g. finite - size properties , remain open questions even for perfectly mixed populations . throughout this paper",
    "we assume that the populations are well - mixed so that any infected individual can spread the disease to any susceptible individuals .    in the ubiquitous susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) infection process , the population includes three types of of individuals :    * uninfected individuals who are susceptible to the infection .",
    "* infected individuals who are actively spreading the disease . * individuals who are neither infected nor susceptible including those who have been infected and subsequently recovered , or became immune , or removed .",
    "an individual may proceed from type @xmath12 to @xmath13 to @xmath14 . in this simplified model",
    ", all infected individuals may spread the disease .",
    "we investigate the continuous - time version of sir infection process @xcite . at any given moment , the population consists of @xmath15 susceptible , @xmath3 infected , and @xmath4 recovered individuals ; the size of the total population , @xmath16 , remains fixed . the sub - populations change due to two competing processes  infection and recovery . an infected individual may infect a susceptible one with rate @xmath17 , where @xmath0 is the infection rate : @xmath18 the overall infection rate is proportional to the size of the susceptible population times the size of the infected population .",
    "infected individuals recover at a constant rate , @xmath19 without loss of generality , the recovery rate is set to one .",
    "we consider the natural initial condition where a single infected individual is embedded in a `` sea '' of susceptible individuals , that is , @xmath20 at time @xmath21 .",
    "the infection process ends when no infected individuals remain , @xmath22 .",
    "the final number infected , @xmath23 , measures the size of the epidemic outbreak .",
    "since the infection process is random , the size of the epidemic outbreak is a stochastic quantity .",
    "first , we investigate the distribution of this quantity as its basic characteristics show how the infection process can be in one of two phases : an endemic phase where a microscopic number of individuals are infected and a pandemic phase where a macroscopic number of individuals are infected .    in this section",
    "we analyze the infinite population limit , @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath25 be the probability that the size of the epidemic outbreak equals @xmath23 .",
    "for the initial condition @xmath20 , the total infection rate and the total recovery rate are @xmath0 and @xmath26 as follows from . in the very first step , the infected individual either recovers , or a second individual become infected .",
    "the former happens with probability @xmath27 , while the latter occurs with the complementary probability @xmath28 .",
    "hence , the distribution @xmath25 obeys the recursion equation @xmath29 valid for all @xmath30 .",
    "the convolution term corresponds to the case where an additional individual become infected  in this situation there are two infection processes , and in the infinite population limit these two processes are completely independent @xcite . starting with @xmath27 ,",
    "the recursion equation gives @xmath31 , @xmath32 , etc .",
    "we now introduce the generating function @xmath33 using the generating function we convert the infinite set of recursion equations ( [ gn - eq ] ) into the quadratic equation , @xmath34 . out of the two solutions ,",
    "the proper one satisfies the requirement @xmath35 , @xmath36    the behavior of @xmath37 in the limit @xmath38 reveals the basic characteristics of the infection process .",
    "the probability @xmath39 that only a _",
    "finite _ number of individuals are infected is given by @xmath40 the derivation of follows from and .",
    "the threshold value @xmath41 separates two regimes of behavior  an endemic regime and a pandemic regime . below the threshold ,",
    "the number of infected individuals is always finite . above the threshold",
    ", there is a finite probability that a finite _ fraction _ of individuals becomes infected , and as a consequence , the average size of the epidemic outbreak is macroscopic , that is , proportional to the size of the total population .",
    "also , the average number of infected individuals readily follows from the generating function , viz . .",
    "equation gives @xmath42 as expected , the size of the outbreak diverges in the vicinity of the threshold .    to find @xmath25",
    ", we expand the generating function @xmath37 in powers of @xmath43 .",
    "the distribution of outbreak size is a product of an exponential and an algebraic factor , expressed as a ratio of gamma functions , @xmath44^{n-1}.\\ ] ] by using the asymptotic behavior @xmath45 as @xmath46 , we conclude that at the epidemic threshold , @xmath1 , the size distribution has a power - law tail @xmath47 as @xmath48 . for threshold epidemics ,",
    "there is balance between infection and recovery , as indicated by . while the majority of outbreaks are small , the algebraic behavior suggests that there is a considerable likelihood for large outbreaks to occur .    in the remainder of this section , we focus on the behavior at the epidemic threshold , @xmath1 .",
    "we begin with the probability @xmath49 that there are @xmath3 infected individuals at time @xmath5 .",
    "irrespective of the infection rate , this distribution function satisfies a closed evolution equation , and for the critical @xmath1 case , @xmath49 satisfies @xmath50 the initial condition is @xmath51 .",
    "equations are closed because in the infinite population limit , @xmath52 , the population of infected individuals does not depend on the populations of susceptible and recovered individuals .",
    "we comment that the master equation is a discrete diffusion equation with a diffusion coefficient equal to the size of the infected population .",
    "to solve we use the exponential ansatz : for @xmath53 , with the initial conditions @xmath54 and @xmath55 to assure the validity of @xmath51 .",
    "this ansatz reduces the infinite set of equations to two ordinary differential equations , and . solving these coupled equations we obtain @xmath56 for @xmath53",
    "thus , the size distribution is purely exponential .    the quantity @xmath57 gives the probability that the infection process has subsided by time @xmath5 . from and the initial condition @xmath58",
    ", we obtain .",
    "equivalently , one can deduce this result from the normalization requirement @xmath59 .",
    "note also that the survival probability @xmath60 , defined as the probability that the infection remains active at time @xmath5 , is simply @xmath61 , and hence , it is given by @xmath62 in the long time limit , the survival probability decays algebraically , @xmath63 .",
    "interestingly , the first moment of the distribution @xmath64 is conserved , @xmath65 , and in this sense , the competing processes of infection and recovery balance when @xmath1 .",
    "hence , if we restrict our attention to active outbreaks , the average number of infected individuals grows linearly with time , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 .    in the long - time limit",
    ", the distribution @xmath49 has the scaling form @xmath68 this scaling behavior immediately follows from in the limit @xmath69 and @xmath70 with the scaling variable @xmath71 kept fixed .",
    "the master equation is closed since the infected population is decoupled from the other two populations . in contrast , the recovered population is coupled to the infected population .",
    "therefore , we must analyze the joint distribution @xmath2 , that is , the probability there are @xmath3 infected and @xmath4 recovered at time @xmath5 .",
    "of course , the joint distribution function gives a complete description of the state of the system and for example , .",
    "the joint distribution obeys @xmath72 and . in this rate equation , the first gain term accounts for infection , while the second gain term represents recovery . for small @xmath3 and",

    "the distribution of recovered differs from the distribution of infected in that in the long - time limit , it approaches a nonzero value , @xmath98 , whereas @xmath99 for all @xmath53 . to study the long - time asymptotic behavior , we write @xmath100 .",

    "heuristically , @xmath108 since the recovery rate is constant .",
