    "stevenson et al .",
    "@xcite showed that a diode structure can produce indistinguishable and entangled photons with electrical pumping . the first to show indistinguishable photons from the biexciton state were mller et al . in 2014",
    "also the indistinguishability of photons from two quantum dots  @xcite , from a quantum dot photon and a photon generated by a spdc source  @xcite and between a quantum dot photon and a laser  @xcite has been studied .",
    "thus , with improved experimental techniques and device engineering over the years , there has been steady improvement in the quantum properties and brightness from quantum dot photons .",
    "in addition , theoretical studies of two photon interference  @xcite and experimental realizations with photons created by atom - cavity systems  @xcite showed that apart from the spatial and the polarization overlap of the photons the quality of the wavepackets also plays an important role . here , especially important",
    "are the dephasing and the jitter of the arrival time of the wave packets .",
    "to better understand these effects in a quantum dot system we have made a comparison study .",
    "we measured the interference of the fields from both exciton and biexciton photons from an inas quantum dot under different excitation conditions in a hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) interferometer .",
    "in particular , we measured the indistinguishability of exciton photons with a varying excitation pulse length and a varying detuning of the excitation with respect to a quasi resonance .",
    "additionally , we performed an indistinguishability measurement in resonant excitation of the biexciton . in this process",
    "the exciton state is populated from the radiative biexciton decay , resulting in an additional time - jitter compared to quasi resonant excitation of the exciton .",
    "the quasi resonant excitation is not time - jitter free since phonon relaxation is needed to populate the exciton state , but the time - jitter is much smaller than the biexciton decay , because it is non radiative .",
    "the phonon relaxation time is in the order of a few ps  @xcite , whereas the radiative lifetime of the biexciton is 370@xmath0 .    for the investigations of the indistinguishability of the biexciton photon",
    ", we performed two different excitation schemes - resonant excitation and above band excitation .",
    "for resonant excitation of the biexciton state we use a two - photon excitation exploiting a virtual level  @xcite . for comparison",
    ", we performed a hom interference measurement on the biexciton recombination photon with the quantum dot excited above - band , where phonon transitions are needed to relax to the biexciton state .",
    "this pump scheme introduces two mechanisms that reduce the indistinguishability : first , the time uncertainty of the relaxation process , which causes timing jitter  @xcite and second , charge noise induced by charge carriers in the vicinity of the quantum dot , which shifts the quantum dot resonances through varying potentials .",
    "_ theory : _ if two indistinguishable photons simultaneously impinge on a beamsplitter , they coalesce and leave the beamsplitter through the same output port .",

    "timing jitter , which is an additional time uncertainty in the excitation process , produces an effective decoherence with a gaussian shape instead of an exponential one .",

    ", we set a fixed slit width in the pulse stretcher to produce 3@xmath0 pulses and moved the slit position to introduce detuning .",
    "the amount of detuning was measured using a spectrometer . due to",
    "the detuning the quasi resonant pump process gets less efficient and incoherent pump processes can contribute more to the measured signal .",
    "this leads to a decreased indistinguishability of the emitted photons .",
    "figure  [ fig : p - shell ]  d shows the influence of the excitation pulse length on the indistinguishability of the emitted photons . here",

    "the excitation power was kept constant .",
    "the measurement result shows that longer excitation pulses reduce the indistinguishability of the emitted photons .",
    "this could have several reasons .",
    "obviously , an additional time uncertainty caused by the longer pulse is added in the excitation process .",
    "also multiple excitations could occur , since the probability for the exciton state to decay , while the pump pulse is still present , increases .",

    "the time axis here is the time between two detection events as in figure  [ fig : p - shell]a and not the delay time between the two photons .",
    "the blue data points represent a measurement where the impinging photons have parallel polarization and will interfere on the beamsplitter , whereas the red data points represent a measurement with orthogonally polarized photons , which do not interfere because they are distinguishable in their polarization .",
    "the dashed lines are theoretical curves for infinite detector timing resolution with the given coherence time and lifetime .",
    "the solid lines are a convolution of the theoretical curve with the detector resolution of @xmath39 . ]    in figure  [ fig : xx - hom ] the result of the hong - ou - mandel measurement for the biexciton photons is depicted . here",
    ", we performed the measurement with a two - photon resonant excitation scheme on the biexciton state .",
    "for comparison we also performed a measurement using above - band excitation .",
    "the comparison with a quasi resonantly excited biexciton state is not possible because the quasi resonant excitation does not decay through the biexciton state .",
    "the result for above - band excitation is depicted as green open circles . under these excitation conditions",
    "the two photons appear to be completely distinguishable , although the ( one photon ) coherence time is about the same as for the resonant excitation case ( 140(10)@xmath0 and 211(5)@xmath0 , respectively ) .",
    "timing jitter could be responsible for this behavior because it is only present in the above - band excitation case .",
    "the blue filled circles represent measurements where the quantum dot was excited directly to the biexciton , exploiting a two photon resonant excitation .",
    "to further improve the hom interference , we set up an intensity modulator , which is an interferometer with an electro - optic phase modulator to create constructive or destructive interference on the output beamsplitter . with this pre - selection technique the shape of the quantum dot photon wave packet",
    "can be modified  @xcite .",
    "this shaping shortens the photon wave packet , mimicking a shorter lifetime and thereby improves the ratio of coherence time to lifetime .",
    "the fitted lifetime for the blue filled circles ( two photon excitation ) is @xmath40 which agrees very well with the externally measured value for the lifetime of @xmath41 and the lifetime for the red triangles ( two photon excitation and shortening by intensity modulator ) is @xmath42 .",
    "the two curves were fitted simultaneously , because the coherence time is not influenced by the shaping procedure and the common value is @xmath43 . employing the intensity modulator improves the @xmath44 ratio , but does not yet allow for @xmath45 , as shown in figure  [ fig : xx - hom ]  a.",
    "we show that our initial result of 0.39(2 ) for the the indistinguishability of the biexciton photon can be improved to 0.71(3 ) by applying time filtering . for comparison , the result for the biexciton indistinguishability from mller et al .",
    "@xcite is 0.58(4 ) ( uncorrected ) ; however the lifetimes in  @xcite are shorter and the coherence lengths are approximately the same as reported here",
    ".    we also want to compare our result to the best reported values for resonant excitation of an exciton state , which are 0.82(10 ) from gazzano et al .",
    "@xcite and 0.91(2 ) from he et al .",
    "both of these works used a sample structure with micro - pillar cavities to shorten the lifetime of the exciton state and thereby drastically improving the @xmath44 ratio .",
    "all of the given values are uncorrected for two reasons : first , one can not distinguish a background event from a detected event , because the detector can not discriminate between a thermal electron or a photon .",
    "therefore , we think that subtracting the background , although its amount is known , is not a valid operation .",
    "second , if one wants to build a scalable network with the given resources , the real , measured value is of interest and not a corrected one , because it is not possible to correct for the error while the photon is propagating through a network .",
    "all errors given by finite mode - overlap or remaining multi - photon contribution will add up and decrease the final process fidelity .",
    "we can speculate that if we would apply a micro - pillar cavity with a purcell - factor of @xmath46 , the biexciton photon would show an indistinguishability of one .",
    "a micro - pillar cavity with such a purcell - factor is rather standard , but the suppression of the scattered excitation laser would be the challenge in such a case .",
    "we compared different excitation schemes and conclude that the pump scheme as well as the exact pumping conditions influence the indistinguishability of single photons emitted from a single semiconductor quantum dot . as reported before  @xcite , resonant excitation leads to the highest quality photons .",
    "additionally , we showed the amount of improvement in indistinguishability of the biexciton photon between resonant two - photon excitation and above - band excitation is 39(2)@xmath47% .",
    "further we showed that time filtering using an intensity modulator can improve the indistinguishability by improving the ratio of the lifetime to the coherence time @xmath48 . in our case",
    "this improved the indistinguishability to 71(3)@xmath47% .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that for improving the quality of single photons to perform linear optics quantum computation , quantum communication , and quantum sensing , quantum dots must be pumped resonantly .",
    "the quality of the photons can be enhanced to the desired level if their lifetime is shortened , either by elaborate cavity designs  @xcite or by applying time filtering .",
