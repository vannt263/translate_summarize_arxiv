    "since 1995 more than thirty full genomes have been sequenced and information on the sequences of hundreds of millions of nucleotides has been available for the scientific community .",
    "this has opened a new field of research , dna statistical analysis , where genomic sequences are analyzed both in terms of single nucleotides , oligonucleotides and thousands of nucleotides . in the last case",
    "there are studies on the power spectral density and correlation function , especially the question of the existence of statistical long - range base - base correlation .",
    "long - range correlation in dna was first observed in 1992 by three groups , li et al . @xcite , peng et al .",
    "@xcite and voss @xcite .",
    "this has been a very active topic until now .",
    "we will not put a long list of references here but we cite only some of the the recent papers by h.e .",
    "stanley et al .",
    "@xcite , arnodo et al .",
    "@xcite and vieira @xcite addressing the problem directly .",
    "one can also visit a www home page by li ( _ http://linkage.rockefeller.edu/wli/dna_corr _ ) for the references to this particular topic .",
    "we have also contributed to the topic , e.g. , in the papers @xcite-@xcite we show that replication , which is an asymmetric process , is responsible for introducing strong trends in the third bases of codons and in consequence it causes the long - range base - base correlations .    the examinination of the long - range correlation in dna is strongly connected with the statistical methods applied to texts in natural languages @xcite-@xcite , where usually one calculates the frequency @xmath2 of each word in a text ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "if the words in the text are arranged in rank order , from most frequent to least frequent , so that @xmath4 then one observes a power law ( zipf law ) , @xmath5 , with an exponent @xmath6 and typically @xmath7 for natural languages .",
    "this analysis also applies well to studying short - range time correlations in financial signals @xcite . in dna",
    "the words are composed from an `` alphabet '' of four letters @xmath8,@xmath9,@xmath10,@xmath11 representing the nucleotides _ adenine , thymine , guanine _ and _ cytosine_. the @xmath12-tuplets are termed `` n - words '' .",
    "the biological meaning of these @xmath12-words depends on the value of @xmath12 . typically in the case of coding dna sequences",
    "the words are considered to be @xmath13-tuplets because three nucleotides ( codons ) code for one amino acid .",
    "this triplet structure of dna coding sequences can be easily detected with the help of the power spectrum because there is a sharp peak at frequency @xmath14 in the spectrum .",
    "the connection of the peak with the codon structure has been reported already by voss @xcite in 1992 during discussion of the long - range correlations in dna .",
    "this peak reflects the asymmetry of codons .",
    "for example , in the case of the yeast genome ( _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ ) more then @xmath15 of all genes have more @xmath8 than @xmath9 in the first and second positions in codons , more @xmath10 than @xmath11 in the first positions of codons , and less @xmath10 than @xmath11 in the second positions @xcite .",
    "codons for hydrophobic amino acids are rich in @xmath9 in the second positions whereas codons for hydrophilic amino acids are rich in @xmath8 in the second positions .",
    "in particular , the genes with lower number of @xmath8 than @xmath9 in the second positions in codons represent genes coding for transmembrane proteins .",
    "thus , considering @xmath13-tuplets in coding regions to be the words in dna texts is quite natural , contrary to the words for noncoding regions which are not known . on the other hand , the observation of a much smaller peak around @xmath16 in dna power spectrum @xcite,@xcite makes the understanding the dna words more complex .",
    "namely , this peak might be related to dna folding structure .",
    "the detailed discussion of the meaning of the peak can be found in a paper by trifonov @xcite as well as a discussion of other recognized periodicities in genome sequences , @xmath17 and @xmath18base periodicities .",
    "the results of zipf analysis of 40 dna sequences have been discussed in detail by mantegna et al .",
    "they found that the zipf exponent @xmath6 for a noncoding region is about @xmath19 larger than that for coding regions and thus noncoding sequences are closer to natural languages with respect to their information content than the coding ones .",
    "note however that also noncoding regions of dna can possess a strong signal @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the reason is that there can be found both sequences which were coding in past and sequences which may be recognized as genes in future .",
    "the studies of oligonucleotides ( @xmath12-words ) in recent years indicate that they can play the role of a genomic signature .",
    "karlin and burge , in their paper @xcite showed that the relative abundance of dinucleotides ( @xmath20-words ) can discriminate dna sequences of different organisms .",
    "the abundances , particularly for @xmath21 and @xmath22 can reflect the species - specific replication and repair mechanisms ( see also karlin , mrzek and campbell @xcite ) .",
    "they analyzed different dinucleotides with the help of effective frequencies :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 denoted the frequency of nucleotide @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) and @xmath27 denoted the frequency of dinucleotide @xmath28 under consideration .",
    "in particular , they suggested that @xmath21 under - representation should be advantageous for organisms which have small genomes and need to replicate rapidly . on the other hand @xmath22 under - representation renders dna more flexible for unwinding .",
    "the concept of genomic signature has been been extended recently to @xmath12-words @xcite where the chaos game representation of dna sequences in the form of fractal images has been used following the method developed by jeffrey @xcite .",
    "we address this paper because we have introduced a similar concept of dna representation independently in our paper @xcite . in the method ,",
    "the frequencies of @xmath12-words are represented by a complex landscape of `` hills '' and `` valleys '' located on a square board .",
    "an example of such a chaos game representation of a dna sequence is presented in fig.[fig1 ] for @xmath29-tuplets constructed from nucleotides located in the first base position in codons , second base position in codons and third base position in codons in the case of the yeast genes .",
    "one can observe asymmetric usage of the @xmath29-words .",
    "a similar result can be obtained for other values @xmath12 of length of words under consideration .",
    "in general , one can observe many oligomer repeats in the `` hills '' of the landscape , especially if one includes noncoding dna regions .",
    "their number is closely related to the mutation pressure and selection .",
    "the statistical properties of short oligonucleotides have been discussed recently by buldyrev et al . @xcite . in particular",
    ", they showed that the number of dimeric tandem repeats in coding dna sequences is exponential , whereas in noncoding sequences it is more often described by a power law .    in the following",
    "we restrict ourselves to statistical analysis of @xmath29-tuplets only and to this aim we have considered the relative frequencies of @xmath29-words by a simple generalization of the eq.[r_karlin ] :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the frequency of the word @xmath32 in the genome under consideration , and @xmath24 , @xmath33 , ",
    ", @xmath34 are the respective nucleotide frequencies ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath36 means that for a chosen @xmath29-word the frequency of its usage in the genome is the same as the expected probability calculated from the nucleotide occurrence . both under - representation and over - representation of @xmath29-words might introduce the short - range correlation effects .",
    "if the words have a biological sense in dna texts , they will be correlated at least in the region of a gene .",
    "the choice of variables @xmath37 in eq.[rsingle ] to represent effective frequencies of @xmath29-words instead of absolute frequencies @xmath31 guarantees that trivial correlations , the artefacts coming from the nucleotide bias , have been removed .",
    "thus , if the numbers @xmath37 associated with the respective @xmath29-words represent biased random values only , their zipf plot should be horizontal .",
    "we would like to address the paper by vandewall and ausloos @xcite who used this argumentation in their analysis of financial data - daily fluctuations of the apple stock price .",
    "we analyze separately three gene subsequences , obtained by splicing nucleotides from position ( 1 ) in codons , position ( 2 ) in codons and position ( 3 ) in codons .",
    "next , the three resulting nucleotide sequences are partitioned into non - overlapping @xmath29-tuplets .",
    "note that some @xmath29-tuplets can be strongly under - represented .",
    "the reason is that @xmath29-tuplets are already gene - specific and in the extreme case it can happen that a @xmath29-tuplet from a gene under consideration does not appear in any other genes .",
    "this could introduce a strong correlation effect .",
    "therefore , the values of @xmath37 in eq.[rsingle ] for a gene under consideration are calculated with the help of the frequencies @xmath31 , @xmath24 , @xmath33 ,  ,",
    "@xmath34 in a bank of @xmath29-words representing all genes except the considered one . in fig.[fig2 ] we present the zipf plots done for @xmath29-tuplets in the case of 2772 yeast genes taken from @xmath38 .",
    "the results suggest that we can expect non - trivial correlations between successive @xmath29-words .",
    "the reason for the observed step - like structure in fig.[fig2 ] is that some deviations of @xmath31 from the expected value are more frequent than others and , in general , the probability of choosing the next word may depend on several of the preceding words .",
    "note that the representation of genes by the effective frequencies ( eq.[rsingle ] ) of their @xmath29-tuplets loses some information concerning base arrangement .",
    "it is often the case that different @xmath29-tuplets have exactly the same deviation of @xmath31 from the expected value in the genome .",
    "thus a question could arise : is the @xmath37 representation of genes consistent with the lvy walk analog of a two - dimensional dna walk in space ( a - t , g - c ) , discussed by abramson , alemany and cerdeira @xcite ? in @xcite it has been shown that the mean square displacement of the dna walker follows the power law @xmath39 , where @xmath40 denotes the number of steps and @xmath41 for yeast chromosomes .",
    "once @xmath42 this walk corresponds to the lvy walk .",
    "we could expect that the distribution of the effective frequencies of @xmath29-words should keep the memory of the lvy flights performed in space ( a - t , g - c ) . to show this",
    ", it will be convenient for us to introduce a new variable @xmath43 , which is the effective frequency @xmath37 defined in eq.[rsingle ] shifted by 1 :      in fig.[fig3 ] we plotted the distribution of numbers @xmath43 representing yeast genes solely from one dna strand .",
    "almost the same distribution we have got for the numbers @xmath43 calculated for genes located in the complementary strand . in fig.[fig4 ] , we symmetrized the distribution of the numbers @xmath43 by introducing the values @xmath45 in the case of @xmath29-tuplets of the complementary dna strand .",
    "the long - tail feature of the distribution of the numbers @xmath43 is compared in the figure with a lvy flight distribution calculated for the exponent @xmath46 , a value characteristic for the yeast genome @xcite .",
    "the property of the large variance of @xmath37 is consistent with the suggestion of non trivial correlation by fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the results are consistent also with other data presented in fig.[fig5 ] , where for each gene length the maximum value of @xmath43 has been plotted . in the figure we can observe a trend that long genes use more",
    "strongly over - represented @xmath29-words than short genes .",
    "an analogous situation we have noticed in the case of under - represented @xmath29-words . if selection on the extremely over - represented / under - represented @xmath29-words was strong , long genes would be more affected by spontaneous mutations than short genes .",
    "this is suggested also by the results @xcite of our monte carlo simulations of gene evolution under constant mutation pressure and selection , where we showed that short genes accumulate more mutations per gene length than the long ones @xcite .",
    "the fact that spontaneous mutation rates per nucleotide are inversely correlated with genome size has been first discussed by drake et al .",
    "@xcite and later by karlin and burge @xcite .",
    "our results might relate this phenomenon to the strong over - representation and under - representation of some @xmath12-words representing oligonucleotides .",
