    "[ fig : a262_unsharp ] we show the residual image of the cluster center resulting from subtracting the elliptical model from the gaussian smoothed image .",
    "in addition to the inner eastern x - ray hole discussed in @xcite , the residual image also reveals the first evidence of an x - ray tunnel to the west of the cluster core .    the inner eastern cavity is significant at the 22 @xmath14 level and appears",

    "we have extracted counts in an annulus with inner and outer radii equal to the distance from the agn of the inner and outer edge of the tunnel region , respectively , and excluded the counts from the tunnel region itself for the annulus counts .",

    ", the residual image also shows evidence of the faint eastern cavity discussed in @xcite ( marked with dashed circle ) .",
    "analysis of the new merged @xmath0 data shows that this feature is still of low significance compared to x - ray counts at a similar radius .",
    "the residual image also shows a deficit to the north of the cluster core that is significant at roughly the 8 @xmath14 level .",
    "this deficit is located between two bright x - ray knots that are associated with [ n ii ] emission @xcite and may either be a signature of a clumpy icm or an additional x - ray cavity .",
    "further to the east of the cluster core there appears to be a previously unknown extended x - ray deficit surrounded by a faint x - ray rim .",
    "analysis of this extended complex region shows that it is significant at only the 2 @xmath14 level .",
    "in figure  [ fig : vlab_l ] we show the vla b configuration 1400 mhz image of b2 0149 + 35 .",
    "the central radio emission contains a compact core connected to a western extension which may trace the western radio jet .",
    "a bright region to the east of the core may be associated with the counterjet which would suggest an initial position angle of @xmath5 65@xmath15 ( from north to the east ) for the jet axis . beyond the bright central regions the radio emission extends into the western and eastern radio lobes .",
    "the outer lobes lie at a different position angle through the core as compared to the bright jet and counterjet .",
    "this variation in the source position angle may indicate bulk rotation of the surrounding icm such as suggested by @xcite for centaurus a. numerical simulations of the impact of bulk icm motions on embedded radio galaxies reveal that such motions can reproduce observed radio galaxy morphologies @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation for the structure of b2 0149 + 35 is that the position angle of the radio jets has precessed over time as suggested for clusters such as perseus @xcite , rbs797 @xcite and abell 2626 @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the eastern radio lobe is coincident with the inner eastern cavity seen in the @xmath0 data .",
    "figure  [ fig : vlab_l ] shows that in addition to the s - shaped radio source , there is a compact radio source located @xmath16 kpc east of the core of b2 0149 + 35 .",
    "this source has no x - ray counterpart and no known optical identification but seems to be located near the eastern edge of a faint optical source on the second generation digitized sky survey ( dssii ) images .",
    "the total radio flux of the compact source at 1400 mhz is 0.67 @xmath17 0.17 mjy .",
    "although the low signal to noise on this source makes the calculation of the spectral index uncertain , we note that it is consistent with that of typical extragalactic sources .",
    "combining the a , b , and c configuration 1400 mhz data allows us to trace more extended radio emission from b2 1049 + 35 since these data are sensitive to lower surface brightness emission .",
    "figure  [ fig : mos1]a shows the combined three configuration data set as contours overlaid on the central region of the residual @xmath0 image .",
    "we note the presence of bright x - ray clumps to the north - east and south - west of the radio core at roughly the projected location where the radio jets change position angle .",
    "higher resolution radio data of the jets would help determine if there is a connection between the x - ray clumps and the jet deflection .",
    "the entire radio source appears to be fully confined by the bright x - ray rims seen in the residual @xmath0 image .",
    "the radio emission shown in figure  [ fig : mos1]a extends further to the west and north - west of the radio core than is seen by @xcite . beyond the north - west emission",
    "there is a further radio extension to the southwest , along the x - ray tunnel .",
    "the radio emission appears to be continuous from the core toward the north - west to a distance of @xmath5 34  ( @xmath5 11 kpc ) at which point it appears to break up into two connected clumps to the south - west within the tunnel .",
    "both clumps reveal extended structure and do not have any optical identifications ; thus they are most likely tracing radio plasma ejected from the central agn in ngc 708 . at the lowest contour level ( 3@xmath14 )",
    "the western emission does not reveal an obvious sharp edge to the source suggesting that we may not be tracing the full extent of the emission at this frequency .",
    "the emission to the east , beyond the counterjet location , fills the inner eastern x - ray cavity and appears to have a relatively well defined edge .",
    "lower frequency full - resolution radio observations at 610 mhz from the gmrt highlight again the close confinement of the synchrotron emission by the bright x - ray rims seen in the @xmath0 image ( figure  [ fig : mos1]b ) .",
    "these new radio data also confirm the presence of extended radio emission tracing the southwest x - ray tunnel and show that the emission extends further down the tunnel at this frequency .",
    "they also reveal diffuse emission running from the eastern radio lobe to the region south of the compact radio source .",
    "this eastern emission is coincident with the location of the faint ghost cavity mentioned in @xcite and thus supports the interpretation of this region as an x - ray cavity .",
    "the total flux in the eastern extension ( excluding the compact source ) is 5.3@xmath17 0.5 mjy .",
    "we have also analyzed the 610 mhz data applying a suitable taper to the @xmath18 distribution to produce a map sensitive to the large scale diffuse emission .",
    "the taper was chosen to allow us to match the 131 beam of our lowest frequency observation at 235 mhz .",
    "the tapered 610 mhz image ( figure  [ fig : mos2]a ) reveals radio emission extending the full length of the tunnel and shows a series of connected clumps of emission running @xmath5 22 kpc eastward ( in projection ) from the eastern x - ray cavity .",
    "these previously unknown radio clumps are coincident with the newly detected extended outer eastern cavity discussed in section  [ sect : chan_anal ] .",
    "an inspection of the dss images shows that there are no apparent optical counterparts to the eastern emission regions .",
    "the total ( projected ) linear extent of the radio emission at 610 mhz is @xmath5 60 kpc , more than 3 times larger than previously reported by @xcite .",
    "similar evidence of larger source sizes at low frequencies has been seen in other cluster - center radio sources such as m87 @xcite , perseus @xcite and hydra a @xcite where the large outer structures have been interpreted as signatures of one or more past agn outbursts .",
    "the clumpy morphology of the eastern emission and total extent of the radio emission in abell 262 is also seen in figure  [ fig : mos2]b where we show the vla 330 mhz data convolved to the same resolution as the tapered 610 mhz data .",
    "our lowest frequency observations at 235 mhz are shown in figure  [ fig : mos2]c .",
    "these data also trace the western radio emission over the full length of the x - ray tunnel . on the eastern side of the source ,",
    "the 235 mhz observations reveal radio emission located well beyond the eastern compact source out to the edge of the 610 mhz extensions seen in figure  [ fig : mos2]a . at the 3@xmath14 contour level",
    "this emission does not show a continuous connection to b2 0149 + 35 but this is likely due to the lower sensitivity of the 235 mhz data .",
    "we have made a spectral index map of the central radio source using the 235 and 610 mhz gmrt data .",
    "the @xmath18-coverage of both data sets was matched and both frequencies were imaged with a circular 131 @xmath19 131 beam .",
    "we show this spectral index map in figure  [ fig : spix ] where we have blanked the spectral index map at the 3@xmath14 level on each of the input maps .",
    "the colorbar at the top shows the ( linear ) spectral index scale running from @xmath20 to @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "we have overlaid the 610 mhz tapered contours in white on figure  [ fig : spix ] to provide a reference for the source morphology in the locations where we have measured the spectral index .",
    "typical uncertainties in the flux measurements due to calibration and systematic errors at the gmrt are of the order of 5% at 235 and 610 mhz @xcite , resulting in a typical error on the spectral index of @xmath23=0.2 .",
    "the spectral index in the area of the radio core is fairly flat ( @xmath24 ) which is typical of recently injected particles .",
    "the spectral index toward the western part of the source steepens away from the core reaching a value of @xmath25 in the region of the x - ray tunnel .",
    "the integrated spectral index of the radio emission in the tunnel is @xmath26 .",
    "the origin of the apparent spectral flattening of the emission on the western edge of the tunnel is uncertain and may be a result of low signal to noise at the edge of the 235 mhz image since the apparent steepening is within roughly the 3@xmath14 errors on the spectral index map . toward the eastern edge of the source",
    "the spectral index steepens less dramatically away from the core reaching @xmath27 .",
    "the region of the eastern radio clumps shows an even steeper spectral index of roughly @xmath28 .",
    "although we can not use the current data to trace small spectral index variations accurately across the source , we note that the spectral steeping observed from the core toward the outer source edges is significant above the 3@xmath14 level and likely traces spectral aging of the relativistic particles as they travel further from the core .",
    "we have also made spectral index maps using the 330 mhz and 1400 mhz images and find similar evidence of spectral steepening away from the core in those maps .",
    "the spectral index determined for the full source measured from our observations between 235 and 4535 mhz is @xmath29 , where we have assumed an uncertainty of 5% on the gmrt 235 mhz flux , and 1% on the vla 4535 mhz flux . assuming a similar flux uncertainty of 5% on the gmrt 610 mhz observations we find an integrated low frequency spectral index of @xmath30 between 235 and 610 mhz .",
    "these observations suggest a possible flattening of the radio spectrum to low frequencies but we note that this can not be confirmed from these data due to the relatively large errors on the gmrt flux estimates .",
    "we have searched the literature for total flux measurements of b2 1049 + 35 in order to determine the overall spectral shape of the radio emission .",
    "we list the available flux measurements in table  [ tbl : fluxes ] and plot the radio spectrum including both our new measurements and the data from the literature in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "several of the measurements from the literature were obtained with sufficiently large beams that the measured flux is contaminated by sources surrounding b2 0149 + 35 .",
    "these measurements are marked with triangles in the figure .",
    "the shape of the radio spectrum can be used to estimate the age of the source by using models to fit the balance of energy injection and losses .",
    "although the available flux measurements for b2 0149 + 35 cover roughly a factor of 65 in frequency , they still do not sample a large portion of the radio spectrum .",
    "we have fit all measurements in table  [ tbl : fluxes ] to several particle injection models to determine the break frequency of the emission of the full source .",
    "the fits were done for both the full sample of flux measurements and also the subset of uncontaminated flux measurements .",
    "the three models used to fit the data were the jp ( jaffe - perola ) , kp ( kardashev - pacholczyk ) and ci ( continuous injection ) spectral models .",
    "the jp and kp models both assume a single `` one - shot '' injection of a power - law distribution of electrons with no further acceleration @xcite .",
    "the jp model allows for pitch - angle scattering , resulting in an exponential cutoff in the emission spectrum , while the kp model does not allow pitch - angle scattering and thus has an emission spectrum consisting of two power - laws .",
    "the ci model assumes a continual injection of a power - law distribution of relativistic particles resulting in a spectral break that changes by @xmath31 in @xmath32 .",
    "all three models produce similar fits to the data and predict the break frequency lies in the range of 1400 to 9600 mhz .",
    "we find similar spectral break frequencies if we include or exclude the contaminated flux measurements from the literature .",
    "we have also separately fit the break frequency for the bright emission filling the eastern cavity as well as the fainter emission in the tunnel and to the east of the x - ray cavity .",
    "these regions were fit using only the data presented in this paper as the individual regions needed to be isolated to determine the fluxes .",
    "the break frequency in the bright regions is between 2200 and 12000 mhz while in the fainter extended emission it is between 1900 and 7400 mhz . for all models we assume an initial injection spectrum of @xmath33 which is the measured spectral index of the source between 330 and 610 mhz .",
    "the average radiative age of the synchrotron emission is given by @xcite as : @xmath34^{-0.5}\\ \\   { \\rm yr}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the magnetic field strength in the source in gauss , @xmath36 is the equivalent magnetic field strength of the microwave background [ @xmath37 gauss ] , and @xmath38 is the break frequency in ghz . assuming a break frequency at the low end of the model predictions of 1400 mhz and that the source field strength is @xmath39 to give the maximum radiative lifetime @xcite , we estimate the age of b2 0149 + 35 as @xmath40 myr . if the break frequency is near the high end from the spectral fits ( 9600 mhz ) , we then obtain a younger age of @xmath5 18 myr .",
    "the central radio source in abell 262 appears to have had a significant impact on the thermal gas distribution in the center of this cluster . @xcite",
    "showed the cluster core contains several knots of x - ray emission as well as at least one x - ray cavity to the east of the radio core while our new residual @xmath0 image reveals the presence of an x - ray tunnel running westward from the agn as well as an extended outer eastern cavity ( figure  [ fig : a262_unsharp ] ) .",
    "we use our observations of the synchrotron emission to obtain estimates of the radio properties for comparison with the surrounding thermal gas properties .",
    "the western extension along the x - ray tunnel is fairly faint at 1400 mhz and thus the spectral index of the extension is not well constrained at high frequencies . in   [ sect : spectral ] we estimate the low frequency spectral index of the emission in the tunnel to be @xmath26 .",
    "we use this spectral index measurement together with the flux measurement at 610 mhz to estimate the minimum energy properties of the western radio extension .",
    "we follow the notation of @xcite and assume that the emission from the western extension comes from a uniform prolate cylinder with a filling factor ( @xmath41 ) of unity and that there is equal energy in relativistic ions and electrons ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "we use a source size of @xmath43 kpc and a model where the magnetic field is perpendicular to the line of sight and the spectral index is constant between the lower cutoff frequency of 10 mhz and the upper frequency cutoff of 100 ghz . using these parameters for the tunnel , we calculate a minimum energy magnetic field strength of @xmath44 = 5.0 @xmath45 g , a non - thermal pressure of @xmath46 dyn @xmath47 and a synchrotron lifetime at 1400 mhz of @xmath48 myr .",
    "note that adiabatic expansion reduces the loss rate of the relativistic electrons , and as a result the synchrotron lifetime may be shorter than derived from the observed radio properties .",
    "the x - ray gas pressure in the region surrounding the tunnel is estimated from the @xmath0 observations to be @xmath49 dyn @xmath47 .",
    "this x - ray pressure is more than 25 times larger than our estimated minimum energy synchrotron pressure .",
    "this discrepancy between the synchrotron and x - ray pressure is typical of many cooling core systems as shown by @xcite .",
    "similar pressure discrepancies are found in the case of lobes associated with several more powerful frii sources as well ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such a pressure difference can not be physical since it would result in a rapid collapse of the radio lobes .",
    "this may suggest that the assumptions used in our minimum energy calculations are wrong .",
    "equipartition between the synchrotron plasma and thermal gas would require @xmath50=260 , which would suggest that the lobes are fed by heavy jets .",
    "an alternative solution to the pressure discrepancy is that there is an additional form of pressure support in the lobes ( e.g.  a very hot diffuse thermal gas ) .",
    "the synchrotron emission coincident with the outer eastern x - ray cavity has a spectral index ranging from @xmath51 to as steep as @xmath52 between 235 and 610 mhz . using the flatter spectral index and the minimum energy assumptions above",
    ", we estimate a minimum energy magnetic field strength of @xmath44 = 2.6 @xmath45 g , a non - thermal pressure of @xmath53 dyn @xmath47 and a synchrotron lifetime ( neglecting adiabatic expansion ) at 1400 mhz of @xmath54 myr .",
    "we estimate an average x - ray pressure of @xmath55 dyn @xmath47 in the same region as the synchrotron emission .",
    "as discussed above , this pressure difference can not be physical and likely indicates either incorrect minimum energy assumptions or the presence of an additional form of pressure support within these regions .",
    "if the western radio extension represents a buoyant lobe from a previous outburst then we can estimate the buoyancy rise time for the lobe to reach the end of the tunnel .",
    "the sound speed in the thermal gas is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the adiabatic index of the gas , @xmath58 is the x - ray temperature of the gas , @xmath45 is the mean molecular weight of the gas , and @xmath59 is the mass of the proton . using @xmath58= 1kev from @xcite , the sound speed in the central cluster region is @xmath60 km s@xmath7 .",
    "as the lobe rises it will approach a terminal velocity that is determined by the balance of buoyancy and drag forces .",
    "based on the terminal velocity approach of @xcite , @xcite give the terminal velocity in terms of the kepler speed ( @xmath61 ) as @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the bubble radius , @xmath64 is the bubble distance from the cluster center and the kepler speed is given by @xmath61=@xmath65 .",
    "the local gravitational acceleration , @xmath66 , can be estimated from the local stellar velocity dispersion assuming the galaxy is an isothermal sphere , @xmath67 . the stellar velocity dispersion for ngc 708",
    "is given by @xcite as 235 km s@xmath7 , which results in a terminal velocity of @xmath68 245 km s@xmath7 for the outer bubble .",
    "based on the above terminal velocity , we find a buoyant lobe would reach the observed ( projected ) location at the end of the tunnel on a timescale @xmath69 myr .",
    "note that the lower limit on the buoyancy timescale is due to projection since the radio structure may not be in the plane of the sky . on the other hand ,",
    "if the tunnel remains evacuated of thermal icm between successive outbursts then the rise time calculated above overestimates the timescale for the synchrotron emitting plasma to reach the end of the tunnel .",
    "we can not make a firm statement regarding the need for particle re - acceleration in the tunnel due to the uncertainties in the estimates of the synchrotron lifetime of the particles in the tunnel (   [ sect : pressure ] ) as well as the uncertainties in the buoyancy rise time .",
    "the radio emission on the eastern side of the core ( beyond the eastern lobe ) likely represents emission from one or more previous outburst episodes from the central agn .",
    "we measure projected distances from the center of the eastern cavity of @xmath5 10 , 17 , and 21 kpc for the three eastern structures . assuming that each of these represents a buoyant lobe from a past agn outburst and using the calculated terminal velocity of the buoyant bubbles ( @xmath68 245 km s@xmath7 )",
    ", we can estimate the outburst repetition rate in this system to be @xmath70 myr .",
    "this outburst timescale is similar to the estimate for perseus using the observed spacing of the x - ray ripples @xcite .",
    "such a short repetition timescale would suggest that multiple outbursts may be responsible for creating the emission seen in the tunnel .",
    "we note that it seems unlikely that the repetition rate is as long as the typically assumed @xmath71 yr since buoyancy arguments would require the bubbles to be aligned at an inclination of less than 20  from the line of sight .",
    "an alternative interpretation for the new radio morphology is that the three eastern clumps may represent a much larger fragmented bubble from a single outburst that occurred prior to the current activity powering the inner lobes . in this case ( even without considering projection effects ) our repetition timescale would be an underestimate of the true repetition timescale .",
    "our new radio observations of b2 0149 + 35 show significant structure in the radio source to the east of the x - ray cavity . interpreting the synchrotron emission as a series of buoyantly rising bubbles from past radio outbursts allows us to obtain a lower limit on the total energy input into the icm over at least four outburst episodes in this source .",
    "we assume that the bubbles rise buoyantly and undergo adiabatic expansion in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding thermal gas . following the notation of @xcite , the initial energy input from the outburst",
    "is related to the final bubble properties by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the adiabatic index of the plasma in the lobes , @xmath74 is the initial ambient pressure where the lobe was originally inflated , @xmath75 is the surrounding pressure at the current location of the buoyant lobe , and @xmath76 is the volume of the bubble at the current location . due to sensitivity limitations ,",
    "x - ray depressions are difficult to isolate for all radio features of b2 0149 + 35 and thus the cavity volumes are estimated based on the observed synchrotron emission seen at 610 mhz .",
    "the radio emission is less sensitive to projection effects than x - ray depressions ( as also noted by * ? ? ?",
    "the a262 cavity system provides us with the opportunity to estimate variations in outburst energies over several episodes for the same agn .",
    "we have separated the radio source into 7 components ( 4 east of the core and 3 west of the core ; figure  [ fig : comps ] ) and calculated the initial input energy from the agn required to create these regions .",
    "the inner ( spherical ) eastern cavity was defined based on the x - ray cavity size and morphology .",
    "we use the same bubble shape and volume to match the inner western cavity while the remainder of the western x - ray tunnel is represented by a prolate cylinder . at the end of the western tunnel",
    "we define a small prolate cylinder based on the radio morphology .",
    "the outer eastern components were defined based on the radio morphology visible above the 5@xmath14 level .",
    "the first component is spherical while the outer two components are represented by prolate cylinders .",
    "the bubbles were assumed to be initially inflated at a radius consistent with that of the active eastern radio lobe and associated x - ray cavity . using the location of the active eastern cavity rather than the cluster center as the inflation and detachment point avoids complications from likely supersonic or transonic jets closer to the cluster core .",
    "the x - ray pressure surrounding each region was determined from the radial profile obtained from the @xmath0 observations .    in table",
    "[ tbl : energies ] we present a summary of the sizes and initial input energies calculated for each component",
    ". the lower limit on the initial energy input varies from @xmath77 ergs up to @xmath78 ergs , while the total energy summed over all 7 radio components is @xmath2 ergs .",
    "this total energy input is similar to the average energy calculated for typical ` single ' outburst systems @xcite . from the results in table  [ tbl : energies ] we find that the current epoch of activity from b2 0149 + 35 is the most energetic if our underlying assumptions on the origin of the radio morphology hold .",
    "in fact , the distribution of the outburst energy for each of the components of the source shows that the energy appears to be roughly consistent with a continual increase to the current epoch .",
    "such an increase in outburst energy may be the signature of a system where the cooling luminosity continues to dominate over the agn energy injected into the icm leading to an increase in the fueling of the agn with time and thus more energetic outbursts .",
    "the observed trend in outburst energy for b2 0149 + 35 is different from that seen for the multi - cavity system in hydra a @xcite . in that case , @xcite find that the energy required to create the outer cavities is nearly an order of magnitude larger than that for the inner cavities .",
    "we also note that the cavity size trend for b2 0149 + 35 seen in table  [ tbl : energies ] does not follow the bubble size versus radius trend seen in the cavity sample of @xcite .",
    "based on the radio morphology , we suggest that the source components are the result of 4 outburst episodes that have a repetition time of @xmath79 myr .",
    "the total agn kinetic luminosity over these outbursts is @xmath80 ergs s@xmath7 .",
    "@xcite estimate the cooling luminosity in a262 to be @xmath81 ergs s@xmath7 , which is roughly a factor of two higher than the estimated agn kinetic luminosity . although @xcite showed that the current radio outburst is apparently too weak to offset cooling assuming @xmath82 yr , our new data suggest that the agn in ngc 708 can offset cooling on average with our shorter repetition timescale over the observed multiple outburst episodes .",
    "if the eastern radio morphology is instead the result of fragmentation from a single outburst episode it is likely that the energy output estimate above would underestimate the true agn output .",
    "the presence of the intracluster medium confining the radio lobes allows us to compare estimates of the kinetic energy of the radio jets to the observed bolometric radio luminosity of the system .",
    "the radiative efficiency determined from embedded agns provides important insights into the impact of agn outbursts on the evolution of the host galaxy and the intracluster medium as well as information relating to agn accretion and jet formation models .",

    "@xcite find the radiative efficiencies fall in the range of a few tenths of a percent to a few percent .",
    "the total radio luminosity of b2 0149 + 35 was calculated by integrating the flux between 10 mhz and 10 ghz assuming a constant spectral index of @xmath84 and the total flux as measured from our 235 mhz observations .",
    "we find the bolometric radiative power to be @xmath85 ergs s@xmath7 , roughly 50% higher than the bolometric luminosity calculated in @xcite",

    "[ sect : ebal ] we estimate the total agn kinetic luminosity to be @xmath87 ergs s@xmath7 , giving a radiative efficiency similar to @xcite of @xmath5 0.1% , reinforcing the view that this source appears to be a very inefficient radiator .",
    "the inferred black hole mass for b2 0149 + 35 can be calculated using the velocity dispersion versus black hole mass relation of @xcite .",
    "the stellar velocity dispersion of 235 km s@xmath7 for ngc 708 @xcite corresponds to a black hole mass of @xmath88 .",
    "the total energy output estimated for the four outburst episodes traced by the radio emission implies an average accretion rate of 0.001 @xmath89 yr@xmath7 assuming @xmath90 as the efficiency of converting accreted mass to kinetic energy outflow .",
    "this mass accretion estimate is similar to that determined by @xcite from the analysis of only the inner x - ray cavities in abell 262 .",
    "we have undertaken a detailed multi - frequency radio study of b2 0149 + 35 which is associated with the cluster - center galaxy in abell 262 .",
    "our new low frequency radio observations reveal that the source is nearly three times larger than previously known .",
    "the s - shaped source seen by @xcite is surrounded by emission to the east and west .",
    "the western emission extends from the edge of the @xcite source toward the southwest .",
    "a comparison of high and low resolution images shows that this emission appears to be composed of several synchrotron clumps which are surrounded by diffuse emission .",
    "the eastern extension beyond the @xcite source is composed of three clumps of emission which are connected to the main source by a faint synchrotron bridge .",
    "spectral index images of the emission reveal a steepening of the spectrum away from the radio core .",
    "a morphological comparison of the radio and x - ray emission in abell 262 shows a significant interaction in the cluster core .",
    "the innermost of the newly identified eastern radio structures falls at the position of a low significance x - ray deficit identified by @xcite .",
    "the other two outer eastern radio features appear to be associated with a newly discovered x - ray depression .",
    "the western radio emission completely fills the newly discovered x - ray tunnel seen in our residual @xmath0 image .",
    "similar x - ray tunnels filled with low frequency emission are seen in abell 2597 @xcite and perseus @xcite .",
    "these tunnels may represent regions where multiple radio outbursts pile up and accumulate over several agn activity cycles .",
    "the integrated radio spectrum of b2 0149 + 35 shows evidence of spectral steepening to high frequencies . using three particle injection models ( jaffe - perola , karsashev - pacholczyk , and continuous injection )",
    ", we estimate the break frequency to be between 1400 and 9600 mhz . under the source field strength assumption given in section  [ sect : int_spec ] , this range of break frequencies leads to upper limits on the radiative age of the source of between 47 and 18 myr .",
    "minimum energy synchrotron arguments yield a synchrotron lifetime of @xmath5 37 myr for the source at frequencies around 1400 mhz .",
    "these timescales can be compared to the buoyancy timescale ( @xmath91 80 myr ) calculated assuming that the western lobe is from a past outburst and that it detached and rose buoyantly to the end of the x - ray tunnel . from this comparison ,",
    "it is not clear whether active particle injection or particle acceleration is required within the tunnel to maintain the observed radio emission due to the large uncertainties in the synchrotron age (  4.1 ) and buoyancy timescale (  4.2 ) .",
    "we have also used the projected separation of the eastern clumps of emission in the buoyancy model ( assuming the lobes rise at the terminal velocity ) to estimate a lower limit of @xmath92=28 myr on the average repetition rate of outbursts for the central agn .    the x - ray pressure surrounding the extended radio emission",
    "is estimated to be more than 25 times larger than the minimum energy synchrotron pressure calculated if we assume a synchrotron filling factor of unity and equal energy in relativistic ions and electrons .",
    "this discrepancy may suggest that the radio lobes are fed by heavy , baryon - dominated plasma .",
    "alternatively there may be an additional form of pressure support within the radio lobes .",
    "the total energy input into the icm of abell 262 over multiple outburst episodes was calculated by assuming that each radio component to the east of the core represents a lobe from an agn outburst . in this model the western emission filling the tunnel would be the result of a series of overlapping buoyant lobes .",
    "the total energy input over the 4 outbursts is estimated to be @xmath2 ergs . by comparison , the outburst in clusters such as abell 2052 @xcite and perseus @xcite ranges from a few times 10@xmath93 to a few times 10@xmath94 ergs .",
    "the most powerful known radio outburst is in ms0735.6 + 7421 with an estimated energy of @xmath95 ergs @xcite .",

    "this efficiency agrees well with that previously calculated for this system by @xcite .",
    "although previous measurements of the kinetic radio power of b2 0149 + 35 indicated that the current outburst was too weak to offset the radiative cooling , our new measurements suggest that the source can approximately offset the radiative cooling on average over the four observed outburst episodes .",
    "the ubiquitous nature of low frequency radio emission as a chronicle of recent and past agn activity in clusters underscores the importance of emerging instruments such as lofar and the lwa for delineating the role of agn feedback in the icm .",
