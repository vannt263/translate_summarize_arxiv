    "full - sky surveys in the far infrared have been achieved by means of the iras and cobe satellite observations .",
    "schlegel et al . ( 1998 ) built a reddening map from the 100 @xmath0 m iras dust emission distribution considering temperature effects using 100/240 @xmath0 m dirbe data .",
    "the transformation to e(b - v ) maps was obtained from dust columns calibrated via the ( b - v)-mg2 relation for early type galaxies . this far - infrared reddening ( hereafter e(b - v)@xmath3 )",
    "presents a good agreement at high galactic latitudes with that derived from h i and galaxy counts by burstein & heiles ( 1978 , 1982 ) with an offset of 0.02 mag ( lower values for the latter method ) .",
    "recently , hudson ( 1999 ) analysed e(b - v)@xmath3 maps using 50 globular clusters with @xmath4 and distance from the plane @xmath5 kpc , as well as 86 rr lyrae from burstein & heiles ( 1978 ) .",
    "these two samples provided slightly lower values on the average as compared to schlegel et al.s reddening values ( @xmath6e(b - v ) = -0.008 and -0.016 , respectively ) .",
    "the reddening comparisons above hardly exceed the limit e(b - v ) @xmath2 0.30 , so that a more extended range should be explored .",
    "since the galaxy is essentially transparent at 100 @xmath0 m , the far - infrared reddening values should represent dust columns integrated throughout the whole galaxy in a given direction .",
    "star clusters probing distances as far as possible throughout the galaxy should be useful to study the dust distribution in a given line of sight .",
    "globular clusters and old open clusters are ideal objects for such purposes because they are in general distant enough to provide a significant probe the galactic interstellar medium and have a suitable sky coverage .",
    "clearly , star clusters beyond the disk dust layer are expected to have reddening values essentially comparable to those of galaxies in the same direction . on the other hand , clusters within the dust layer",
    "should have contributions from clouds in background regions .",
    "another issue is the thickness of the milky way dust lane and whether some dust clouds occur at higher distances from the plane .",
    "recently , several edge - on spiral galaxies have been studied in detail ( howk & savage 1999 ) and a comparison of their dust distribution with that of the milky way is worthwhile .    the aim of the present study is to compare star cluster reddening values measured from direct methods , i.e. sampling the dust effects seen in the light emitted by the cluster members , with those derived from the 100 @xmath0 m dust emission .",
    "we investigate the possibility of background and foreground dust contributions in star clusters directions . in sect.2",
    "we present an overview of schlegel et al.s ( 1998 ) reddening values predicted in different environments in the galaxy .",
    "in sect.3 we gather the necessary data for globular clusters and old open clusters and describe the sample properties . in sect.4",
    "we discuss the results , especially the star cluster lines of sight with evidence of background dust .",
    "finally , the concluding remarks are given in sect.5 .",
    "for a better understanding of the reddening distribution throughout the galaxy we extracted e(b - v)@xmath3 values from schlegel et al.s maps using the software _ dust - getval _ provided by them .",
    "we discuss ( i ) directions along the galactic plane which accumulate reddening from sources in different arms and other large structures , and ( ii ) galactic latitude profiles to see the effects of relatively isolated nearby ( high latitude ) dust clouds .",
    "we show in fig.1 the entire galaxy longitude profile .",
    "the upper panel is in direction of the galactic centre and the lower one is in direction of the anticentre .",
    "note the enormous reddening differences between the two panels : the lower panel has typical values of e(b - v)@xmath71.5 , and the values in the upper panel are a factor @xmath2 10 higher .",
    "we indicate a series of hi , co and optical features which help interpret the reddening distribution : ( i ) tangent regions of the spiral arms sagittarius - carina , scutum ( 5 kpc arm ) and 4 kpc arm ( henderson 1977 , georgelin & georgelin 1970a , cohen et al . 1980 ) ; ( ii ) the extent of the 3 kpc arm ( kerr & hindman 1970 , bania 1980 ) ; ( iii ) the extent of the far side of the sagittarius - carina arm ( grabelsky et al .",
    "1988 ) ; ( iv ) the molecular ring ( mr ) and the central molecular zone ( cmz ) , ( combes 1991 , morris & serabyn 1996 ) ; and finally , ( v ) the extent of the local ( orion ) and perseus arms ( georgelin & georgelin 1970b ) .",
    "the relatively low reddening in the anticentre panel can be basically explained by the cumulative effect of the three external arms : orion , perseus and outer arm ( digel et al . 1990 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that e(b - v)@xmath3 on the average is higher in the second quadrant than in the third quadrant , probably by the interruption of the perseus arm .",
    "the steady increase of e(b - v)@xmath3 in the first and fourth quadrants towards the direction of the galactic center can be explained by the cumulative effect of inner arms and especially their tangent zones .",
    "owing to the 100 @xmath0 m dust emission transparency the far side arms of the galaxy will also contribute to e(b - v)@xmath3 ( see the extent of far side of the sagittarius - carina arm in the fourth quadrant ) .",
    "the molecular ring is also a major contributor , leading to a plateau level e(b - v)@xmath7 20 . finally , the central molecular zone is responsible for the central cusp .",
    "figure 2 shows e(b - v)@xmath3 profiles in the interval @xmath8 for selected galactic longitudes including well - known dark cloud centers .",
    "the individual clouds , especially their central parts can attain comparable ( in some cases higher ) e(b - v)@xmath3 values to disk zones at lower latitudes .",
    "individual dark clouds have a core - halo structure . in the @xmath9 oph dark cloud",
    "the core fwhm is 35 while at e(b - v)@xmath3 = 0.5 the halo diameter is 4@xmath10 . for the chamaleon i complex",
    "the core fwhm is 48 ( in the region of the reflection nebula ic2631 ) while the halo diameter at e(b - v)@xmath3 = 0.5 is 2.9@xmath10 . from these simple comparisons and corresponding solid angles",
    "the zones responsible for the accumulation of reddening throughout the arms appear to be the cloud halos rather than the cores , possibly combined with diffuse galactic dust .",
    "we show in table 1 embedded infrared star clusters and t tauri groups which are related to nearby dust complexes",
    ". they can be useful to analyse the high extinction regime and to compare schlegel et al.s reddening values with those measured directly from infrared ( jhk ) photometry of the stellar content .",
    "we give e(b - v)@xmath3 values for the central positions of these stellar aggregates and indicate to which complexes they belong .",
    "the identifications and locations of these objects are from : ( i ) gomez & lada ( 1998 ) for the t tauri groups related to the dark clouds barnard 30 and 35 ; ( ii ) lada et al .",

    "( 1993 and references therein ) for the @xmath9 ophiuchi ir cluster .",
    "the larger e(b - v)@xmath3 values occur for ir star clusters , while the t tauri groups tend to be associated with lower reddening values . this must reflect the need of higher dust densities for the formation of star clusters and massive stars , conditions which occur in the cores of giant molecular clouds in contrast to less massive dark clouds ( e.g. comern et al . 1993 , carpenter et al . 1997 ) .    for the infrared photometric reddening comparisons with e(b - v)@xmath3",
    "we adopt a total to selective extinction ratio @xmath11 .",

    "( 1998 ) .",
    "jhk photometry of embedded stars in ngc2024 ( comern et al . 1996 ) indicates an average e(b - v ) @xmath16 , lower than that given by e(b - v)@xmath3 ( table 1 ) which might be accounted for if the sources are not the deepest embedded ones and if there still is a considerable amount of dust in the back half of the cloud .",
    "another possibility is that hot stars heat the cloud core beyond the upper limit ( 21@xmath10k ) available in schlegel et al.s temperature maps .",
    "hk photometry of deeply embedded stars in omc-2 ( johnson et al . 1990 ) provided an average @xmath17 , so that the reddening through the whole cloud should be twice as much .",
    "these values are consistent with e(b - v)@xmath18 ( table 1 ) .",
    "jhkl photometry of a deeply embedded source in omc-1 ( minchin et al .",
    "1991 ) indicated a@xmath19 and a@xmath20 which implied a@xmath21 or 90 depending on models with large and small dust grain respectively .",
    "the latter values convert to e(b - v ) = 64.5 or 29.0 respectively , which bracket that from e(b - v)@xmath22 ( table 1 ) , in this case favouring the large grain model .",
    "jhk measurements of stars in the mon r2 ir cluster ( carpenter et al .",
    "1997 ) indicated that most of the embedded stars are in the range @xmath23 somewhat higher than e(b - v)@xmath24 .",
    "mcgregor et al . ( 1994 ) obtained jhk photometry of a star projected close to the center of the reflection nebula ced110 in chamaleon i. they derived e(b - v ) @xmath25 or @xmath26 depending on the assumed spectral type . in this direction",
    "e(b - v)@xmath3 = 3.25 , in reasonable agreement .",
    "comern et al .",
    "( 1993 ) estimated from jhk photometry that deeply embedded sources in the @xmath9 oph dark cloud core have @xmath27 and that field stars in the background of the cloud are possibly affected by e(b - v ) @xmath28 .",
    "these values bracket that of e(b - v)@xmath3 ( table 1 ) which is sensitive to reddening arising from the cloud as a whole .",
    "finally , we compare reddening values for the old / young components of the galactic nucleus ( catchpole et al .",
    "1990 , krabbe et al .",
    "1991 ) , and for the two young star clusters projected close to the nucleus which contain wr stars ( quintuplet cluster = afgl2004 and the arches cluster = object 17 , respectively glass et al . 1990 , nagata et al .",
    "the galactic center reddening is e(b - v ) @xmath29 , that for the quintuplet cluster e(b - v ) @xmath30 and that for the arches cluster e(b - v)@xmath31 .",
    "the e(b - v)@xmath3 values in these directions are exceedingly high ( e(b - v)@xmath32 ) .",
    "high values are expected since in this direction there is an integrated dust contribution behind the nucleus out to the disk edge . in the foreground of the nucleus",
    "we have contributions from the central molecular zone , the molecular ring and the four arms between the sun and the galactic nucleus . by symmetry arguments considering that there are three extra arms in the background outside the solar circle schlegel et al.s reddening values should not exceed e(b - v ) @xmath33 .",
    "a possible explanation is that the dust temperature in the nucleus and surroundings is significantly higher than those in schlegel et al.s temperature map . indeed",
    "the possibility of non - thermal photon flux and existence of three massive young clusters may account for the dust heating .",
    "we conclude that schlegel et al.s reddening values are in general consistent with values obtained from infrared photometry of embedded sources in dark clouds .",
    "some discrepancies for infrared star clusters in the cores of molecular clouds might be explained by dust heated a few degrees above 21@xmath10k . as pointed out by schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) the same dust column density provides a factor of 5 in 100 @xmath0 m flux when heated from 17@xmath10k to 21@xmath10k which are the temperature extremes considered in their study .",
    "for the central molecular zone in the galaxy e(b - v ) @xmath3 values appear to be exceedingly high so that the dust temperature near the galactic nucleus must be higher .",
    "indeed , assuming that e(b - v)@xmath34 the dust temperature implied is @xmath35@xmath10k .      in the following",
    "we calculate the distance from the galactic plane ( z ) of the nearby dust complexes to estimate the dust layer height to which significant reddening is expected , at least in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "considering that the sun appears to be located 15 pc above the galactic plane ( cohen 1995 , hammersley et al .",
    "1995 ) , the corrected distance from the galactic plane @xmath36 is    @xmath37    where d@xmath38 is the object distance from the sun in pc .",
    "hipparcos distances of the orion and @xmath9 ophiuchi complexes are respectively d@xmath38 = 490 pc and d@xmath38 = 125 pc ( de zeeuw et al . 1999 ) , which imply distances from the plane @xmath36 = -148 pc and @xmath36 = 59 pc respectively .",
    "the distance to monoceros r2 is d@xmath38 = 830 pc ( carpenter et al .",
    "1997 ) and @xmath36 = -166 pc .",

    "mon r2 and the orion complex are intrinsically distant enough from the plane to estimate the dust layer height .",
    "the centers of the complexes imply @xmath39 pc .",
    "since dust in the orion complex appears to absorb significantly ( e(b - v)@xmath40 0.20 ) to at least _ b _ = -25@xmath10  see in fig .",

    "they are at extremely low latitudes and in directions not far from the galactic centre ( table 3 ) which can accumulate reddening from dust in several arms and the molecular ring ( sect.2 ) .",

    "however , an important fraction of points in the range @xmath46 has large deviations in the sense of higher e(b - v)@xmath3 . for @xmath47 the points deviate systematically from the identity function in the sense that e(b - v)@xmath3 values are higher .",
    "a possible interpretation would be dust contributions for e(b - v)@xmath3 arising from the cluster background .      in order to check the possibility of background reddening in the directions of globular and old open clusters we define the difference @xmath48e(b - v ) = e(b - v)@xmath3 - e(b - v ) ( tables 2 and 3 , respectively ) .",
    "figure 6 shows @xmath48e(b - v ) histograms considering both samples together . for high latitude clusters ( @xmath43 )",
    "we find a tight gaussian distribution suggesting an error distribution .",
    "we recall that e(b - v)@xmath3 uncertainties typically amount to 16% ( schlegel et al .",
    "the gaussian peak is in the bin 0 - 0.02 , indicating a small offset between the two reddening types with higher values for e(b - v)@xmath3 .",
    "this can also be seen in panel ( a ) of fig.5 as a small systematic shift of the points with respect to the identity function .",
    "there are two deviating objects in panel ( a ) of fig.6 which are the globular cluster m107 ( ngc6171 ) and the open cluster ngc1901 . for m107",
    "e(b - v)@xmath3 = 0.45 and e(b - v ) = 0.33 ( table 3 ) , thus @xmath48e(b - v ) = 0.12 .",
    "recently salaris & weiss ( 1997 ) derived e(b - v ) = 0.38 from isochrone fitting on ccd photometry , and they remarked that for this cluster values in the literature are in the range @xmath49 .",
    "we suspect that the positions of m107 in figs .",
    "5 and 6 reflect an uncertainty in the reddening derived from the stellar methods . on the other hand ngc1901 with e(b - v)@xmath3 = 0.33 and e(b - v ) = 0.06 ( table 3 )",
    "has the lmc disk as background ( sanduleak & philip 1968 ) , so that the high @xmath48e(b - v ) = 0.27 must reflect dust emission from lmc complexes .",
    "panels ( b ) and ( c ) deal with @xmath48e(b - v ) histograms for low latitude clusters ( @xmath45 ) , respectively for @xmath50 and high @xmath48e(b - v ) values . similarly",
    "to panel ( a ) there occurs in panel ( b ) a peak near zero ( bin 0 - 0.04 ) , which indicates that most points indeed closely follow the identity function ( panel ( b ) of fig.5 ) .",
    "thus , schlegel et al.s ( 1998 ) reddening values at low latitudes agree with those derived from stellar data for about two thirds of the clusters .",
    "finally , the histogram for high @xmath48e(b - v ) values ( panel ( c ) ) shows 18 clusters with @xmath51 . these interesting objects",
    "together with the deviating clusters in panel ( b ) , typically with @xmath52 , are discussed in detail in sect.4.4 for the possibility that their reddening values have an origin in the background dust .    since mass loss is important in the last stages of red giant evolution dust accumulation in globular clusters is not unexpected .",
    "cloudlets would contribute to differential reddening in cmds as well as to 100 @xmath0 m dust emission .",
    "forte & mendez ( 1988 ) found evidence for dust within globular clusters .",
    "they studied ten southern globular clusters , in particular ngc362 and ngc6624 , and detected by means of ccd imaging regions with light deficiency which was attributed to dark clouds with intrinsic extinctions close to a@xmath53 = 2.5 .",
    "their sizes are on the order of tenths of a parsec and they occur near the cluster nucleus .",
    "we checked whether schlegel et al.s reddening values are sensitive to internal dust contributions in the clusters ngc362 and ngc6624 .",
    "we extracted e(b - v)@xmath3 values for a cross with 17 pixels in schlegel et al.s maps ( each pixel has 2.4@xmath54 @xmath55 2.4@xmath54 ) .",
    "this cross samples the cluster main body and zones outside it , but still within the tidal radius ( trager et al .",
    "we noted fluctuations in e(b - v)@xmath3 not exceeding 0.01 and 0.02 , respectively . we conclude that schlegel et al.s reddening values are not particularly sensitive to the cloudlets owing to the large pixel size and the cloudlets small covering factor .",
    "star clusters within the dust layer as defined in sect.2.2 ( @xmath56 pc ) are expected to have significant differences between e(b - v)@xmath3 and e(b - v ) values . in order to study the behaviour of @xmath48e(b - v ) we considered the cluster perpendicular distance to the galactic plane ( @xmath36 ) calculated with eq.(1 ) , using the data in tables 2 and 3 for the globular and old open clusters .",
    "figure 7 shows @xmath48e(b - v ) as a function of @xmath36 for four @xmath36 ranges .",
    "panel ( a ) shows objects up to 2 kpc from the plane . clearly , there is a large scatter of @xmath48e(b - v ) values within the 200 pc dust layer , together with a significant wing which extends to @xmath57 pc .",
    "the scatter suggests that most of the differences between reddening values derived from dust emission and the stellar content are due to dust clouds in the disk background of the clusters .",
    "panels ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) show the behaviour of @xmath48e(b - v ) in the regions increasingly away from the disk .",
    "in all three panels @xmath48e(b - v ) values are small which is consistent with the fact that all these objects are halo globular clusters .",
    "the only strongly deviating object in panel ( b ) is ngc6144 ( sect.4.4 ) . in ( b ) and",
    "( c ) the average @xmath48e(b - v ) value is slightly positive corresponding to the small offset caused by higher e(b - v)@xmath3 values .",
    "unless an extremely thin diffuse distribution occurs throughout the halo caused by e.g. cooling flows and/or debris from dwarf galaxies accreted by the milky way , this offset observed for halo globular clusters implies that either schlegel et al.s zero point is slightly overestimated or that intrinsic reference colors , spectral distributions and isochrones were exceedingly red . finally , in panel ( d ) the offset is not present , but the sample is small .",
    "large differences @xmath48e(b - v ) could be caused by the existence of dust clouds behind the clusters , primarily within the dust layer . in order to investigate this possibility we calculated cluster positions in the galaxy and compared them to the assumed dust layer distribution .",
    "the latitude with respect to the true galactic plane is given by    @xmath58    using this corrected latitude @xmath59 it is possible to calculate the perpendicular distance of the cluster to the true galactic plane @xmath60 , the distance along the cluster line of sight from the true plane up to the dust layer edge d@xmath61 , and for the clusters within the dust layer the path behind them d@xmath62 :    @xmath63    where 200 pc refers to the conservative dust layer height , assumption of sect.2.2 .",
    "we also assumed a galactic disk radius @xmath64 kpc .",
    "figure 8 shows in panel ( a ) and in the blowup ( b ) e(b - v)@xmath3 as function of d@xmath61 .",
    "we note in panel ( a ) that objects with large e(b - v)@xmath3 values ( e.g. ngc6134 , pimi19 , liller1 , ic4291 ) have a large path length within the layer .",
    "this is expected since the reddening derived from dust emission ( e(b - v)@xmath3 ) should integrate dust contributions along the whole path throughout to the disk edge ( d@xmath61 ) .",
    "panel ( b ) suggests two correlations with different slopes , which might indicate differences in the cumulative effect of dust emission due to a discrete distribution of dust clouds . in panels ( c ) and its blowup ( d ) the behaviour of @xmath48e(b - v ) is shown as a function of the path behind the cluster up to the disk edge ( d@xmath62 ) .",
    "panel ( c ) suggests that large @xmath48e(b - v ) values for clusters like ngc6134 , pimi19 , liller1 , ic4291 could arise from a dust cloud distribution behind the clusters since their directions and positions in the galaxy imply a large background path up to the disk edge .",
    "panel ( d ) shows considerable scatter which might be due to different origins : ( i ) inhomogeneous distribution of dust clouds , ( ii ) considerable uncertainties , ( iii ) the assumptions of a dusty disk are not satisfactory .",

    "we discuss some of the most reddened optical open clusters .",
    "ngc3603 and westerlund2 are clusters embedded in hii region complexes , where internal reddening is important .",
    "ngc3603 ( @xmath69 = 291.61@xmath10 , _ b _ = -0.52@xmath10 ) is located at a distance d@xmath38 = 7 kpc and has e(b - v ) = 1.44 from the cmd ( melnick et al .",
    "1989 ) , which comprises both the internal and foreground reddening . from the integrated spectrum santos & bica ( 1993 ) obtained a foreground reddening of e(b - v)@xmath70 = 1.18 , implying an internal reddening e(b - v)@xmath71 = 0.26 , by using a template spectrum which included internal absorption .",
    "westerlund2 ( @xmath69 = 284.27@xmath10 , _ b _ = -0.33@xmath10 ) at a distance d@xmath38 = 5.7 kpc has e(b - v ) = 1.67 from the cmd ( moffat et al .",
    "piatti et al .",
    "1998b derived e(b - v)@xmath70 = 1.40 and e(b - v)@xmath71 = 0.27 by means of an integrated spectrum analysis .",
    "westerlund1 ( @xmath69 = 339.55@xmath10 , _ b _ = -0.40@xmath10 ) is possibly the most reddened open cluster which can be optically observed . by means of cmds and integrated spectrum piatti et al .",
    "( 1998b ) derived e(b - v ) = 4.3 and d@xmath38 = 1.0 kpc .    from schlegel",
    "et al.s ( 1998 ) reddening map we obtained very high reddening values derived for these young disk objects at very low galactic latitudes : e(b - v)@xmath3 = 59.7 , 65.7 and 12.3 respectively for ngc3603 , westerlund2 and westerlund1 .",
    "the extremely high e(b - v)@xmath3 for ngc3603 and westerlund2 are probably related to lines of sight intercepting dust cloud cores ( sect.2 ) , presumably the molecular clouds from which they were formed .",
    "since westerlund1 is projected close to the plane not far from the galactic center direction , its high e(b - v)@xmath3 can be explained by the dust cumulative effect produced by a series of spiral arms and the molecular ring in that direction ( sect.2.1 ) .",
    "the globular clusters associated with the sagittarius dwarf are indicated in table 1 .",
    "their e(b - v ) values derived from the stellar content are comparable to those derived from the dust emission .",
    "only a small systematic difference occurs , in the sense that values derived from dust emission are larger by @xmath48e(b - v ) = 0.01 - 0.02 . assuming that m54 , terzan8 , arp2 and terzan7 are slightly foreground or within sagittarius itself , this sets a very low upper limit to the dust content in sagittarius , in agreement with the fact that it is very depleted in h i ( koribalski et al .",
    "1994 ) .      assuming the milky way dust layer height to be @xmath73 pc , table 4",
    "presents the 60 clusters with @xmath52 , showing their height from the plane @xmath67 , the distance in the cluster line of sight from the true plane up to the dust layer edge d@xmath61 , and the path length behind the cluster up to the disk border d@xmath62 .",
    "they are separated in two groups , one formed by clusters within the dust layer ( 10 globular and 33 old open clusters ) and the other by clusters outside it ( 15 globular and 2 old open clusters ) . as discussed in sect.4.1 the large @xmath48e(b - v ) values for clusters within the dust layer",
    "can be explained by dust clouds behind the clusters .",
    "the clusters outside the dust layer with large @xmath48e(b - v ) values ( see also their distribution in fig.7 and the wing in the distribution above the dust layer ) might be explained by higher @xmath67 dust clouds .",
    "a well - known example is the high latitude dust cloud draco nebula at a height from the plane 300 to 400 pc ( gladders et al .",
    "in addition , star forming complexes as traced by means of wolf - rayet stars indicate that they are concentrated within a height from the plane of 225 pc , but some attain 300 pc ( conti & vacca 1990 ) .    assuming a dust layer height @xmath74 pc there would remain only 7 clusters outside the dust layer ( table 4 ) .",
    "this corresponds to 3% of the total sample of 250 star clusters in the present study .",
    "they are all globular clusters : lyng7 , ngc6144 , ngc6256 , ngc6355 , ngc6380 , tonantzintla2 and ngc6401 . among these clusters only ngc6144",
    "is very far from the plane at @xmath75 kpc ( table 4 ) .",
    "although ngc6144 has no ccd photometry yet , the photographic cmd and the integrated light reddening estimates ( harris 1996 and references therein ) are consistent at about e(b - v ) @xmath2 0.32 .",
    "we suspect that e(b - v)@xmath3 = 0.71 for this cluster is overestimated , arising from foreground dust heated above the upper limit 21 @xmath10k ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) by the hot star @xmath76 scorpii .",
    "indeed , ngc6144 is seen through the edge of the @xmath9 ophiuchi dark cloud complex in the association upper scorpius at distance d@xmath38 = 125 pc ( de zeeuw et al .",
    "the cluster pathsight crosses the reflection nebula illuminated by the red supergiant antares , also designated as ic4606 , cederblad132 or vdb - rn107 in the catalogue of reflection nebulae by van den bergh ( 1966 ) . the neighbouring star @xmath76 scorpii is double ( b2iii + o9.5v ) , and ionizes the hii region sh2 - 9 ( sharpless 1959 ) , or gum65 ( gum 1955 ) .",
    "this hot double star also has its reflection nebula component cederblad130 ( vdb - rn104 ) , which almost overlaps with the antares reflection nebula .",
    "it is possible that dust grains in the direction of ngc6144 are being heated by this particular configuration . at any rate ccd photometry of ngc6144",
    "is necessary to definitely establish the reddening e(b - v ) affecting the cluster stars .",
    "howk & savage ( 1999 ) detected high - z dust structures in a sample of 7 edge - on spiral galaxies ( ngc891 , ngc3628 , ngc4013 , ngc4217 , ngc4302 , ngc4565 and ngc4634 ) .",
    "the thickness of the dust lanes in these galaxies is in the range @xmath77 pc .",
    "the high - z dust features have typical dimensions of hundreds of parsecs and are located at heights in the range 500 - 1450 pc .",
    "the present study indicates the need of a milky way dust layer of thickness @xmath78 pc in order to explain the lines of sight of 97% of the known intermediate age and old clusters .",
    "the remaining 3% would require some higher z clouds .",
    "since the 100 @xmath0 m dust emission reddening maps of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) provide whole - sky reddening estimates with relatively high angular resolution it is important to explore them in detail for a better understanding of the dust properties in different directions .",
    "we provided an overview of the distribution along the galactic plane and in some interesting latitude directions .",
    "the accumulation of dust clouds in different arms and large structures such as the molecular ring can be distinguished .",
    "individual dust complexes , including their cores , have e(b - v)@xmath3 values compatible with those of embedded clusters derived from infrared photometry .",
    "an exception is the nuclear region where the temperature in the central molecular zone appears to be underestimated in the schlegel et al.s temperature maps .",
    "the 100 @xmath0 m dust emission reddening maps provide e(b - v)@xmath3 values compatible to e(b - v ) derived from the stellar content of globular and old open cluster for @xmath2 75% of the 250 directions probed in the present study ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the values for most high - latitude clusters ( @xmath1 ) are in good agreement ; these are objects in general outside the disk dust layer , so that all dust in the line of sight is sensitive to both methods .",
    "an interesting exception is ngc1901 which is outside the dust layer and has a e(b - v)@xmath3 much larger than e(b - v ) .",
    "the background dust source in this case is the lmc disk .",
    "the differences between the dust emission and stellar content reddening values occur most frequently for low latitude clusters ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "brightness selection effects due to reddening and distance particularly affect the open cluster sample . in the existing catalogues many intermediate age open clusters are yet to be studied , while future infrared surveys should reveal many new open clusters .",
    "these distant objects are expected to have increasing reddening values , but the @xmath48e(b - v ) values should decrease since the pathsight behind the cluster within the dust layer decreases .",
    "most of the known globular clusters have cmds , but infrared surveys should reveal some new ones in disk and bulge zones .",
    "those far in the disk should behave like the heavily reddened far open clusters .",
    "bandwidth effects on the intrinsic reddening law have implications on the results for larger extinctions .",
    "the fact that most of the points follow a 1:1 fir / optical relation up to e(b - v ) = 1.0 ( fig.5 ) suggests that this effect should become important for reddening values beyond this limit .",
    "an additional complication for objects so heavily reddened that the stellar content can be studied only in the infrared is that the transformations to optical reddening values depend on grain properties .    from the spatial distribution of available objects and their relative positions with respect to the dust layer",
    "we conclude that background dust clouds are probably responsible for these differences .",
    "a dust layer with thickness @xmath81 600 pc is required to explain the distribution of @xmath2 97% of the sample .",
    "some additional higher z dust clouds , like the draco nebula , would also be required to explain the rest .",
    "the present study of reddening in star cluster directions suggests that the milky way is similar in dust layer thickness and occurrence of some high - z dust structures to edge - on spirals studied by howk & savage ( 1999 ) .",
    "in particular the milky way dust layer may be thicker than previously thought .",
