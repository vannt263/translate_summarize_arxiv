    "photons are natural carriers of quantum information and their states are favoured for a variety of applications .",
    "the reason is that photons are very robust against decoherence and possess an ease in distribution .",
    "multi - photon states are therefore the crucial ingredient for quantum cryptography @xcite , quantum lithography @xcite and for experimental tests of quantum mechanics , like the ones performed to rule out local hidden variable theories @xcite .",
    "photons are also often used in quantum computing experiments @xcite .",
    "most of these applications exploit the quantum correlations that are found in entangled states . in this paper",
    "we present a scheme , which can be used to generate _ any _ desired multi - photon state _ on demand _ and might lead to a variety of previously unconsidered applications of photon entanglement .",
    "unfortunately , it is very difficult to create an effective interaction between photons and hence they are difficult to entangle .",
    "photon entanglement is therefore traditionally generated by the means of a single source .",
    "the first source of this type was the atomic cascade , which was used for the first test of bell s inequality @xcite .",
    "another example is spontaneous parametric downconversion .",
    "it enables the creation of maximally entangled photon pairs and is routinely used in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "however , the generated entanglement is necessarily probabilistic and can only be detected postselectively .",
    "hence , parametric down conversion does not scale easily and linear optics experiments with more than five photons are extremely challenging @xcite .",
    "new perspectives for multi - photon experiments arise from recent developments of relatively reliable single photon sources consisting for example of a single atom @xcite or a quantum dot @xcite placed inside an optical resonator . using such sources ,",
    "multi - photon entanglement can be generated with the help of linear optics elements and postselection @xcite .",
    "however , this approach is not deterministic and results in the destruction of the photons upon detection .",
    "avoiding the latter in postselective schemes would require the use of ready - on - demand entangled multi - photon states as ancillas @xcite .",
    "one possibility to create multi - photon entanglement in a deterministic manner is to use a single - photon source with a relatively complex level structure and to map the state of the source and operations performed on it subsequently onto the state of newly generated photons @xcite .",
    "recently it has been shown by schn _",
    "_ @xcite that this approach can be used to generate arbitrary multi - photon states on demand",
    ".    however , instead of trying to entangle the photons directly , one can also entangle several single photon sources .",
    "once this is done , their state can be mapped on demand onto the states of several newly generated photons whenever needed @xcite . in this paper",
    "we describe such a scheme and show that it can be used to generate _ any _ desired @xmath0-photon state on demand . under ideal conditions",
    ", this requires only @xmath0 single photon sources , which can be initialised with the help of single - qubit rotations and repeat - until - success two - qubit quantum gates @xcite . differently from ref .",
    "@xcite , we focus on the generation of time - bin instead of polarisation - entanglement since this decreases the experimental resource requirements significantly .",
    "the presented scheme has many advantages compared to previous proposals for the generation of arbitrary multi - photon entanglement on demand . as in refs .",
    "@xcite , we require only single photon sources , passive linear optics elements and detectors _ without _ photon number - resolution .",
    "nevertheless , we do not rely on the presence of entangled ancilla photons .",
    "the required level structure of the sources is simpler than the ones considered in refs .",
    "@xcite and has already been tested experimentally ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "moreover , there is no need for a final step disentangling the states of the sources from the states of the photons with the help of measurements and single - qubit rotations as in ref .",
    "there are also no restrictions on the location of the photon sources , which can be separated from each other by a long distance , since we do not require an explicit interaction between them",
    ".    however , the initialisation step requires high photon creation and detection efficiencies since the repeat - until - success two - qubit gate @xcite is otherwise not deterministic . in the presence of photon detectors with a finite efficiency",
    "the proposed scheme should be used to prepare the sources in a so - called cluster state @xcite , which can be transformed into any desired state via single - qubit measurements applied to the state of the sources @xcite . alternatively , but less efficiently , the sources could be prepared in a cluster state with the help of the two - qubit quantum gate by protsenko _",
    "@xcite or the entangling scheme by barrett and kok @xcite .",
    "once the sources have been initialised , it should be possible to create single photons on demand .",
    "this process has realistically only a finite success rate but a read - out measurement performed on the state of the respective source can reveal whether a photon has been emitted or not with a very high efficiency @xcite .    to generate @xmath0 entangled photons",
    ", the scheme requires at least @xmath0 single - photon sources .",
    "however , these sources do not have to be totally identical hence relaxing what would otherwise be a steep experimental requirement .",
    "the repeat - until - success quantum gate is constructed such that each emitted photon contributes equally to each photon detection and path fluctuations between the photon sources and the detectors result at most in an overall phase factor with no physical consequences .",
    "the experimental setup is therefore _ interferometrically stable _ and demands only indistinguishability of the sources .",
    "the interfering photons do not even need to arrive simultaneously in the detectors as long as they overlap in the setup within their coherence time @xcite . to illustrate this point , we start the paper with a discussion of the photon interference experiment by eichmann _ et al",
    ". _ @xcite .",
    "in 1982 , scully and drhl @xcite proposed a simple quantum eraser experiment concerning delayed choice phenomena in quantum mechanics .",
    "the setup they considered is shown in figure [ doubleslit](a ) .",
    "it consists of two two - level atoms trapped at a fixed distance @xmath1 from each other .",
    "the particles are continuously driven by a resonant laser field and spontaneously emit photons .",
    "each emitted photon causes a click at a certain point on a screen far away from the particles .",
    "these clicks , when collected , add up to an interference pattern with a spatial intensity distribution , found also in classical double - slit experiments .",
    "this was verified experimentally by eichmann _",
    "et al . _ in 1993 @xcite .",
    "since then the interpretation of this experiment attracted a lot of interest in the literature @xcite . in this section , we give a short description of the above described two - atom double - slit experiment following the discussion by schn and beige @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of the quantum mechanical components , namely the two - level atoms , the surrounding free radiation field and the applied laser light can be modelled with the help of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the role of the applied laser field is to continuously excite the particles .",
    "moreover , the interaction between the atoms and the free radiation field results in the transfer of energy from the excited states of the atoms into the photon modes with wavevector @xmath2 and polarisation @xmath3 . in other words , the hamiltonian of the system entangles the state of the atoms with the free radiation field , whenever there is some population in the excited state .",
    "however , the setup shown in figure [ doubleslit](a ) can not be described by the continuous solution of a schrdinger equation . to take the possibility of spontaneous photon emissions into account",
    ", we also have to consider the environment .",
    "the experimental observation of radiating atoms suggests to model the environment by assuming rapidly repated measurements whether a photon has been emitted or not @xcite . in case of a click ,",
    "the direction @xmath4 of the emitted photon is registered on the screen .",
    "@xcite showed that the state of two atoms prepared in @xmath5 is , up to normalisation , of the form @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the reset operator for the case , in which only atom @xmath8 is present in the setup , and depends on the position of the respective atom .",
    "( [ r ] ) ascertains that @xmath9 is the sum of the reset operators of two independent atoms .",
    "this fact is the origin for the presence of an interference pattern in the two - atom double - slit experiment @xcite .",
    "we now ask the question , what is the probability density to observe a click in a certain direction @xmath4 . under the assumption that the atoms are repeatedly prepared in @xmath5 , this probability density @xmath10",
    "is given by the norm squared of the state in eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) , @xmath11 hence this probability density is of the form @xmath12 this equation shows that the intensity of the light emitted from two atoms is not the same as the sum of the light intensities from two independent atoms ( first two terms ) .",
    "the difference is the interference term ( third term ) , which causes the emission of a photon in some directions to be more likely than the emission into others . if one replaces the pure state @xmath5 by the stationary state @xmath13 of the atoms in the presence of continuous laser excitation , eq .",
    "( [ int ] ) can be used to calculate the interference pattern for the experimental setup in figure [ doubleslit](a ) .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ doubleslit](b ) and agrees well with the observation in the experiment by eichmann _",
    "_ @xcite .    the coupling between the atoms and the free radiation field results in the transfer of energy into the free radiation field . in general",
    ", there is less than one excitation in each mode @xmath14 of the free radiation field .",
    "the interference pattern stems from the wave behaviour of these excitations prior to the detection of a photon .",
    "note that a _ single photon _ does not exist until it is actually detected on the screen .",
    "quantum mechanics tells us that the observations on the screen always result in the detection of an integer number of photons .",
    "moreover , each detected photon is created by both atoms and leaves a trace in and contains information about all its respective sources .",
    "in the following , we use the possibility of strong correlations between emitted photons and the state of their respective sources to process quantum information efficiently . more concretely , we consider single photon sources consisting of an atom - like system with a @xmath15-level configuration trapped inside a resonant optical cavity ( c.f .",
    "figure [ pistol ] ) . to generate a single photon on demand , a laser pulse with a relatively slowly increasing rabi frequency should be applied .",
    "such a pulse transfers an atom initially prepared in @xmath16 via an adiabatic passage into @xmath17 , thereby placing one photon into the cavity @xcite .",
    "from there it leaks out through the outcoupling mirror . repumping the atom afterwards into its initial state results in the overall operation @xmath18 and @xmath16 ( c.f .",
    "figure [ pistol ] ) .",
    "then it is possible to generate a single photon on demand such that its state depends on the initial state of the atom and @xmath19 here @xmath20 denotes an _ early _ and @xmath21 denotes a _ late _ photon .",
    "one way to implement the encoding step ( [ two ] ) is to first swap the atomic states @xmath22 and @xmath16 .",
    "next a laser pulse with increasing rabi frequency should be applied to perform the operation ( [ one ] ) .",
    "afterwards , the states @xmath23 and @xmath16 should be swapped again and the photon generation process ( [ one ] ) should be repeated at a later time . in the final state (",
    "[ two ] ) , the qubit is double encoded in the state of the source as well as in the state of the photon .",
    "the encoding ( [ two ] ) is the main building block for the realisation of a deterministic entangling gate operation between two qubits .",
    "it requires the simultaneous generation of a photon in each of the involved single photon sources .",
    "afterwards , the photons should pass , within their coherence time , through a linear optics network which performs a photon pair measurement on them .",
    "suppose , the two qubits involved in the gate operation are initially prepared in the arbitrary two - qubit state @xmath24 using eq .",
    "( [ two ] ) , we see that the state of the system equals in this case @xmath25 then the state of the photon sources is projected onto @xmath26 ) is a maximally entangled state , this operation is a phase gate with maximum entangling power .    performing a deterministic gate operation",
    "requires a complete set of basis states with each of them being of the form ( [ max ] ) .",
    "such a basis is called mutually unbiased @xcite , since its observation does not reveal any information about the coefficients @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the limitation of linear optics is that it is not possible to perform a complete bell measurement @xcite . at most two maximally entangled photon states",
    "can be distinguished using only available linear optics elements .",
    "we therefore consider in the following a measurement of the basis states @xcite @xmath31 ) shows that these @xmath32 are indeed mutually unbiased . to find out which quantum gate operation belongs to which measurement outcome @xmath32",
    ", we write the encoded state ( [ enc ] ) as @xmath33 and find that @xmath34 with @xmath35 here @xmath36 describes a one - qubit phase gate that changes the phase of an atom if it is prepared in @xmath16 and @xmath37 denotes a controlled two - qubit phase gate with maximum entangling power .",
    "the above equations show that a measurement of @xmath38 or @xmath39 results with probability @xmath40 in the completion of the universal phase gate @xmath37 up to local operations , which can be undone easily .",
    "a measurement of @xmath41 or @xmath42 yields the initial qubits up to local operations .",
    "since the quantum information stored in the system is not lost at any stage of the computation , the above described steps can be _ repeated until success_. on average , the completion of one repeat - until - success quantum gate requires two repetitions .",
    "let us now comment on the experimental feasibility of the proposed two - qubit gate .",
    "one way to realise the above described photon pair measurement is to convert the time bin encoding of the photonic qubits into a polarisation encoding .",
    "it is known that sending two polarisation encoded photons through a beam splitter results in a measurement of the states @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "measuring the states @xmath46 therefore only requires passing the photons through a beam splitter after applying the mapping @xmath47 on the photon coming from source @xmath8 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 as in eq .",
    "( [ xy ] ) .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ repeat](a ) .",
    "figure [ repeat](b ) shows an alternative approach in which the time bin encoded photons are send through a bell multiport beam splitter .",
    "an early ( late ) photon from source 1 should enter input port 1 ( 3 ) and an early ( late ) photon from source 2 should enter input port 2 ( 4 ) .",
    "more details can be found in refs .",
    "for the initialisation of the photon sources we combine the two - qubit phase gate from above with single - qubit rotations , achieved by standard quantum optics techniques as routinely employed in ion trap experiments @xcite .",
    "they constitute a universal set of gates and can therefore be used to prepare @xmath0 single photon sources in any desired entangled state  @xcite . especially easy to prepare are @xmath0-qubit states that belong to the class of two - dimensional matrix - product states .",
    "they can be generated using only @xmath50 two - qubit gate operations between `` neighbouring '' sources , since they can always be written as @xmath51 is a one - qubit state and @xmath52 is a two - qubit quantum gate acting on qubit @xmath53 and qubit @xmath54 .",
    "which operations @xmath52 have to be applied in order to prepare a certain final state is described in detail in ref .",
    "familiar examples of two - dimensional matrix - product states are @xmath55 states , @xmath56 states and , most importantly , one - dimensional cluster states @xcite . to generate a one - dimensional cluster state ,",
    "the @xmath52 are the controlled - phase gates @xmath37 defined in eq .",
    "( [ xxx ] ) if the single photon sources are initially all prepared in @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "once the atomic qubits have been initialised , @xmath0 photons in exactly the same state can be created by simply mapping the state of the sources onto the state of @xmath0 newly generated photons .",
    "this can be done whenever required , since the atoms act as perfect single photon storage devices .",
    "the steps involved in this mapping process are similar to the steps involved in the generation of an encoded photon ( [ two ] ) and can be realised using exactly the same atomic level configuration ( c.f .",
    "figure [ pistol](b ) ) .",
    "suppose the state of a single photon source equals @xmath58 to generate a photon in the same state , a single - qubit rotation should be applied that exchanges the states @xmath23 and @xmath16 .",
    "afterwards a laser pulse transfers the state @xmath16 into the state @xmath17 , thereby resulting in the generation of an _ early _ photon .",
    "finally , another exchange of the states @xmath23 and @xmath16 and the creation of a _ late _ photon conditional on the atom being in state @xmath16 results in the overall operation @xmath59 the final state is a state with the atom in @xmath17 and a single photon in latexmath:[\\[|\\psi_{\\rm ph } \\rangle = \\alpha \\ , |{\\sf e } \\rangle + \\beta \\ ,    onto the state of a newly generated photon .",
