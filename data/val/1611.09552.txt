    "ultracold atomic condensates have emerged as suitable and flexible systems to study a variety of effects relating to condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "these effects include many connected to the periodicity found in solid state systems , but more recently also ones stemming from the application of gauge fields . among them",
    "a particularly interesting one is the appearance of vortex structures in magnetic fields above a critical field strength , similar to the physics exhibited by type - ii superconductor systems @xcite .",
    "however , atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) are charge neutral , and hence real magnetic fields have no gauge - field like effects .",
    "nevertheless , one can rely on methods that apply magnetic field to such neutral systems in an artificial manner .",
    "many proposals to generate artificial gauge fields for becs have been put forward in recent years , and several have been successfully implemented @xcite .",
    "a conceptually convenient way is to rotate a bec @xcite , which mimics the lorentz force experienced by a charged particle in a magnetic field , and shows the quantization of circulation in becs by forming vortices and vortex lattices .",
    "another way to generate artificial gauge fields is through raman lasers @xcite , which allow to generate highly stable artificial magnetic fields of large amplitude .",
    "while vortex systems in becs have been thoroughly studied , vortex rings , which are three dimensional structures with a closed loop core ( i.e. , a vortex line that loops back into itself ) @xcite , have been harder to experimentally create and control .",
    "experimental observation of vortex rings has been achieved dynamically , in superfluid helium @xcite as well as for bec systems through the decay of dark solitons in two - component becs @xcite , direct density engineering @xcite , in the evolution of colliding symmetric defects @xcite and very recently in the time evolution of superfluid fermi gases @xcite .",
    "theoretical proposals for the creation of vortex rings in a stationary state include interfering two component becs @xcite , using a spatially dependent feshbach resonance @xcite , and direct phase imprinting methods @xcite . for inhomogeneously trapped becs , however , vortex ring structures are known to be unstable , which results in very short lifetimes and significant difficulties for experimental observation",
    ". the vortex rings either decay into elementary excitations by drifting towards the edge of the condensate @xcite or annihilate within the condensate bulk .",
    "motivated by the large interest in the study of vortex ring structures in becs , we propose here a way to engineer artificial gauge fields for a bec such that vortex rings form naturally .",
    "for this we study a system in which an atomic bec is coupled to an optical nanofibre @xcite and show that the detailed control over the evanescent field outside the fibre allows to obtain control over the creation of stable vortex rings . in time - dependent gauge fields , this can also be used to study vortex ring dynamics in a controlled way .",
    "optical nanofibres have in recent years emerged as versatile tools for tailoring optical near field potentials that can interface with other quantum systems , as they offer controlled propagation of light inside and outside the fibre surface @xcite .",
    "for this reason , experiments are currently carried out in many labs worldwide that explore the possibility of trapping and manipulating cold atomic gases using optical nanofibres @xcite . using two - color evanescent fields around nanofibres , an optical dipole trap for laser cooled atoms near to the fibre surface",
    "has already been realized @xcite , which proves that tapered optical fibres are excellent candidates for realizing versatile light matter interfaces .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the adiabatic motion of trapped bose - einstein condensed atoms around an optical nanofibre and show that the presence of the evanescent fields around the fibre realises interesting artificial gauge fields for the bec system .",
    "because of the large gradient in the generalized rabi frequency , geometric vector and scalar potentials are created , which are related to berry phases and have similar effects on the neutral atoms as the magnetic and electric fields have on charged systems @xcite . in particular",
    "we show that for the fundamental mode of the fibre the artificial magnetic field lines can go solely along the azimuthal direction and therefore allow for the creation of vortex rings .",
    "similar studies to generate artificial gauge fields atop a flat surface , such as above a prism , have recently been presented as well @xcite .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows . in section [ sec : background ] , we briefly discuss the background for our work by first reviewing the general model for the adiabatic motion of atoms in an external electromagnetic field and describing how an artificial vector potential is generated outside of a dielectric surface .",
    "we also review the explicit forms of the evanescent fields . in section",
    "[ sec : agf ] we calculate the expressions for the effective magnetic field profiles resulting from the combination of different polarisations of fundamental he@xmath0 modes of the fibre and describe their effect on bose - condensed atoms trapped around the fibre in section [ sec : gpe_results ] . in section [ sec : hom ] we discuss different magnetic field profiles that can be obtained from higher order modes , and in section [ sec : summary ] we conclude .",
    "let us start by considering a two level atom at position @xmath3 , which interacts with an external laser field @xcite . within the rotating wave approximation its eigenstates",
    "are called dressed states and are given by @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the running phase of the optical field and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the system s rabi frequency with @xmath8 and @xmath9 being the atomic dipole moment and the electric field vector , respectively .",
    "the detuning of the light field from the resonance frequency @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 .",
    "the states are split in energy by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the generalised rabi frequency .",
    "assuming that the atom is initially prepared in state @xmath14 and moves adiabatically in the external light field , its internal state will also adiabatically follow the dressed state .",
    "this leads to the appearance of a geometrical berry phase , and hence a vector potential of the form @xmath15~\\nabla\\phi(\\mathbf{r } ) .",
    "\\label{vecpot } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this represents an artificial gauge potential which is geometric in nature , since it arises from the spatial variation of the dressed state .",
    "the system can therefore mimic the dynamics of a charged particle in the presence of magnetic field , given by @xmath16 .    in the following",
    ", we will use the properties of evanescent fields outside of optical nanofibres to generate artificial magnetic fields for adiabatically moving ultracold atoms .",
    "we will show that these fields can have different profiles , depending on the mode characteristic of the light travelling through the fibre .",
    "if we assume that the field travels freely along the fibre , we can choose @xmath17 , with @xmath18 as the wave number and @xmath19 as the refractive index , and straightforwardly calculate the vector potential as @xmath20 , \\label{vecpot2}\\ ] ] from which the artificial magnetic field follows as    ( ) & = & .",
    "+ [ magfield]since we have evaluated this expression in cylindrical polar coordinates , one can immediately see that the resulting b - field has components pointing along the @xmath21 and the @xmath22 direction . while evanescent field modes have inevitably an @xmath23 dependence , for modes of the nanofibre which have no azimuthal dependence ( for example the ones with circular polarisation ) , only the magnetic @xmath21 component exists .",
    "this is the basis for the ability to generate vortex rings around the fibre .    as can be seen from eq .",
    ", atoms interacting with fields that have large gradients are subject to stronger artificial gauge fields .",
    "evanescent fields outside of optical nanofibres are known to have very large field gradients , and hence these systems are of experimental interest .",
    "since the gradients also depend on the refractive index and the diameter of the fibre , as well as the parameters of the input light field , a large number of valuable control parameters exist with which the strength and spatial structure of the artificial magnetic fields can be changed .",
    "optical nanofibres can be thought of as consisting of an extremely thin cylindrical silica core and an infinite vacuum clad .",
    "they can be created by heating and pulling a standard commercial grade optical fibre so that its waist diameter reduces from a few hundred micrometers to a few hundred nanometers @xcite . since the fibre diameter is smaller than the wavelength of the input light , a major fraction of power propagates outside the surface in the form of an evanescent field .",
    "trapping of atoms around the fibre can be achieved using a setup that relies on two evanescent fields @xcite .",
    "the first field is red - detuned with respect to atomic transition frequency and provides a potential that attracts atoms towards the fibre .",
    "the second field is blue - detuned with respect to atomic transition frequency , leading to a potential that repulses the atoms from the surface . since both fields have different evanescent decay lengths , it is possible to create a potential minimum in the radial direction at a finite distance ( @xmath24 nm ) away from the fibre surface .    in this work",
    "we will explicitly consider the effects of light propagating in the fundamental he@xmath0 mode of the nanofibre , where the frequency , the free space wave number and the wavelength are denoted by @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively . to ensure that only this fundamental mode propagates in the fibre , the single mode condition @xmath28 needs to be fulfilled , where @xmath29 is the radius of the fibre and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the refractive indices inside and outside of the fibre .",

    "one can see that for circularly polarised light fields , the atoms can be trapped in a cylindrical shell which surrounds the nanofibre .",
    "however , when either one or both of the input light fields ( red and blue detuned ) are linearly polarised , the trapping potential possesses minima at specific spatial points in the transverse plane of the optical fibre .",
    "to calculate the gauge fields stemming from the evanescent fields , one can see from eq .",
    "that smaller detunings lead to larger fields .",
    "however , smaller detunings also lead to higher scattering rates and therefore higher losses @xcite . to avoid the latter , detunings used for atom traps are usually chosen to be quite large ( order of thz ) , to ensure low scattering rates , giving coherence times of @xmath49 ms and trap lifetimes of up to @xmath50 s @xcite .",
    "this , however , leads to unobservably small gauge fields .    to overcome this limitation , an alternative arrangement",
    "was recently suggested by m.  mochol and k.  sacha @xcite , which does not depend explicitly on the detuning of the input light field . for nanofibre systems",

    "[ baniso ] ]",
    "the fact that the trapping potentials and the artificial magnetic fields arising from the circularly polarised he@xmath0 modes are azimuthally symmetric allows us to restrict our calculations for the effects of the gauge fields on the bec to the @xmath78 plane , which significantly reduces the required numerical resources .",
    "furthermore , to constrain the extent of the condensate in the @xmath79-direction , and since the exact shape of the trapping potential does not play a role in describing the physics , we will approximate it by a harmonic shape , choosing the harmonic potential in the radial direction to have a minimum at the same location as that of the two color trapping potential .",
    "we use the total artificial magnetic field created by the red and blue detuned input light fields , and solve the time - independent gross pitaevskii equation given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the harmonic trapping potential . the interaction between the atoms",

    "one can see that a single vortex appears on each side of the fibre , close to the position where the gauge field is maximal",
    ".    calculating the circulation of the two vortices shows that they have equal and opposite values , which is due to the fact that the magnetic field lines circulate around the fibre in the azimuthal direction .",
    "they therefore act perpendicularly to the @xmath78- plane on both sides , but in opposite directions , which results in a vortex on the left hand side of the fibre and an anti - vortex on the right hand side . restoring the azimuthal symmetry ,",
    "the two vortices become slices through a vortex ring that is created around the fibre . the specific geometry of a condensate trapped around a nanofibre",

    "increasing the value of the parameter @xmath74 leads to a decrease of the magnitude of the artificial gauge field , but also to an increase in the width of the magnetic field profile .",
    "this increases the overlap with the trapped condensate and one can see in fig .",
    "[ vortices2 ] that this results in the generation of multiple vortex rings around the fibre .",
    "it is worth noting that these solutions are only stable in the presence of the gauge field , i.e.  when light is propagating through the fibre .",
    "however , the field inside the fibre can be changed time - dependently and in particular switched off .",
    "this can lead to situations where the vortex rings can evolve freely inside the condensate , which would allow to study the dynamics of vortex ring interactions starting from a well - defined initial state . to account for all possible effects , which include oscillations along the vortex ring as well as reconnections",
