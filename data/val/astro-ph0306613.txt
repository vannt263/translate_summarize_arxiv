    "such models provide a tool for evaluating the boundary conditions of the heliosphere when constrained with interstellar matter ( ism ) data inside and outside of the heliosphere . however , the loss of interstellar neutrals to charge exchange with interstellar ions in the heliosheath regions ( `` filtration '' , ripken & fahr 1983 , izmodenov et al . 1999 ,",

    "models consistent with a possible interstellar origin for the 2 khz emission observed by voyager in the outer heliosphere ( kurth & gurnett 2003 ) are also discussed , along with evidence for a nearby interstellar magnetic field and time - variability of the boundary conditions of the heliosphere .",
    "the ionization of the ism at the solar location and boundary conditions of the heliosphere are highly sensitive to the interstellar cloud properties integrated from the solar location ( sol ) to the cloud surface . since the  column density to the local cloud surface is log @xmath218 , and photons which ionize h ( @xmath313.6 ev ) and he ( @xmath324.6 ev ) are attenuated to 1/e by log @xmath117.2  and log @xmath117.7  respectively , the  and densities at the sol are sensitive to the radiation attenuation inside the cloud and to cloud geometry . the measurements which best distinguish the properties of the surrounding cloud are those which sample partially ionized elements with first ionization potentials in the range 1325 ev ( e.g. h , he , o , n , ne , and ar ) , which also constitute the parent population of pickup ions and anomalous cosmic rays .",
    "radiative transfer ( rt ) models of ism near the sun ( @xmath23 pc ) are required to predict the ionization of the ism at the sol .",
    "rt models have been constructed using measurements of the interstellar radiation field in the interval 3003000  , a modeled conductive interface between nearby ism and the hot plasma ( @xmath110@xmath4 k ) interior of the local hot bubble , and the cloud composition determined from observations of ism both inside and outside of the solar system ( see sf02 and fs03 ) .",
    "free parameters in these models include the  column density towards the cloud surface ( , which is not directly measured for the sightline used to constrain the models , @xmath5 cma ) , the soft x - ray emission from the local bubble hot plasma ( characterized by plasma temperature ) , the interstellar magnetic field strength ( @xmath6 , which regulates conduction at the cloud boundary and the extreme ultraviolet radiation field , slavin 1989 ) , and cloud density ( = + ) .",
    "sightline - averaged values of the relative ionizations of h and he in the ism are found from observations of the  ionization edge ( 504  ) towards nearby white dwarf stars ( 40100 pc ) , which are strong sources of radiation in this extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) wavelength interval ( e.g. kimble et al . 1993 , vallerga 1996 )",
    ". these data generally sample sightlines with several blended clouds , and show a wide variation in ionization ( /@xmath11015 ) .",
    "the equilibrium models fitting the high he ionization seen in the euv data require an excess of radiation in the 500   region , when compared to the soft x - ray data , and the variation of /  with cloud depth requires radiative transfer models ( e.g. cheng & bruhweiler 1990 , kimble et al .",
    "1993 , vallerga 1996 , sf02 ) .",
    "the initial set of 25 models was pared to seven `` best '' models ( frisch and slavin 2003 , fs03 ) by introducing recent astronomical data indicating gas - phase interstellar abundances of o / h@xmath1400 ppm in long ( @xmath3700 pc ) interstellar sightlines through predominantly diffuse clouds ( andre et al .",
    "2002 ) , since o and h ionizations are closely coupled by charge exchange .",
    "data on /  and /towards @xmath5 cma ( gry & jenkins 2001 ) then indicated that models 2 , 8 , and 18 provide the best match to astronomical data , and model 11 is within uncertainties ( fs03 ) .",
    "fs03 compared these models with he data inside of the solar system , and concluded models 2 and 8 are the best models if he is not filtered in the heliosheath regions .",

    "the radiative transfer models are not well constrained using heliospheric data alone .",
    "the semi - empirical filtration factors predicted by models 2 , 8 are , respectively : h ( 0.46@xmath130.05 , 0.47@xmath130.05 ) , he ( 0.95@xmath130.09 , 1.06@xmath130.10 ) , n ( 0.91@xmath130.17 , 0.93@xmath130.18 ) , o ( 0.65@xmath130.10 , 0.67@xmath130.10 ) , ne ( 1.75@xmath130.34 , 2.34@xmath130.46 ) , and ar ( 1.10@xmath130.49 , 1.22@xmath130.554 , for ar / h=3.16e-6 , see below ) .",

    "gurnett et al . ( 1998 , 2003 ) have detected a relatively isotropic radio - emission signal at 2 khz in the outer heliosphere with the plasma wave instruments on board the two voyager spacecraft ; a possible explanation for the isotropy is emission at the plasma frequency of the surrounding interstellar gas providing this emission can enter the heliosphere ( e.g. izmodenov et al . 1999 ) . _",

    "gg03 have found that model 25 offers a self - consistent solution when heliosphere models of filtration are compared to the pui data .",

    "the interstellar magnetic field ( ) immediately outside of the heliosphere has not been directly measured .",
    "however , observations of weakly polarized light from nearby ( @xmath250 pc ) stars show a patch of interstellar dust centered on galactic coordinates @xmath22=350@xmath23=20 , @xmath24=40@xmath25=5 , with extinction @xmath260.01 mag ( or @xmath12(h)@xmath12 x 10@xmath27 ) and galactic field directed towards @xmath2870  ( tinbergen 1982 , frisch 1990 )",
    "[ fig : pol ] shows the location of the stars ( in galactic coordinates ) , and the polarization vectors , in the region where the weak polarization is most evident , with the plane of the ecliptic superimposed .",
    "also plotted are the radio emission sources detected by the voyager spacecraft which are consistent with an origin near the heliosphere nose and follow roughly the galactic plane ( kurth & gurnett 2003 ) . the weak polarization is most evident near the plane of the ecliptic and coincides with the upstream direction of the cluster of interstellar clouds flowing past the sun ( which is shown in fig . 2 plotted in the local standard of rest , after correction for solar motion ) .",
    "these polarizing dust grains are predominantly within 5 pc of the sun , or closer ( frisch 1990 ) .",
    "although interstellar grain alignment mechanisms are poorly understood , popular grain alignment models yield polarization vectors parallel to the interstellar magnetic field ( lazarian & cho 2002 ) .",
    "the same classical interstellar dust grains which polarize optical radiation also pile up in the heliosheath regions as grains are deflected around the heliosphere ( grain radius @xmath10.1 @xmath29 m , frisch et al .",
    "rand & lyne ( 1994 ) compared pulsar dispersion and rotation measures towards pulsars spaced over several kpc , to derive the strength of the ordered component of the magnetic field near the sun , @xmath6=1.4@xmath130.2 @xmath29 g , directed towards galactic longitude @xmath305 ; this field is consistent with the field traced by tinbergen s data .",
    "once the production mechanisms for the grain alignment and for the radio emission sources are understood , it may produce a deeper understanding of the asymmetries in the heliosphere nose region due to the @xmath160  tilt between the ecliptic plane and interstellar magnetic field .",
    "simple geometrical assumptions indicate the sun left the local bubble interior and entered the surrounding interstellar cloud within the past several thousand years ( frisch 1994 ) .",
    "more precise estimates of the variability of the boundary conditions of the heliosphere result from combining densities from the best rt models with observations of nearby stars .",
    "models 2 and 8 give a local ism density of @xmath10.21 , which when combined with the column density to the cloud surface ( = 6.5 10@xmath31 ) give a distance to the cloud surface of @xmath10.97 pc .",
    "this distance is traversed in @xmath137,000 years by a cloud at the lic velocity .",
    "since the local ism towards @xmath5 cma and @xmath32 cma ( sirius ) consists of two cloudlets ( gry & jenkins 2001 , lallement et al . 1994 ) , and the second blue - shifted cloud has a higher velocity relative to the sun than the lic , the time at which the sun encountered the lic must be shorter than 37,000 years .",
    "frisch ( 1997 ) attributed spikes in the @xmath0be ice core record 33 kyr and 60 kyr ago to encounters with @xmath10.1 pc wide magnetic structures , comoving in the local ism , which confine low energy galactic cosmic rays .",
    "these structures would now be @xmath10.87 pc , and @xmath11.6 pc distant from the sun in the downstream direction ( e.g. towards @xmath5 cma , @xmath32 cma ) .",
    "the most recent @xmath33be spike may be consistent with the solar entry into the local ism ; alternatively it may correlate with the sun s entry into the lic while the earlier event may signal entry into the blue - shifted cloud seen towards cma .",
    "prior to that , the sun was immersed in the hot ( @xmath34 k ) plasma interior to the local bubble where an extended heliosphere ( heliopause radius 300 au in the nose direction ) is predicted ( frisch et al .",
    "( civilization developed as the sun emerged from the local bubble interior , where it resided for several millions of years . )    looking to the future , at least three interstellar clouds are found within 5 pc of the sun in the upstream direction , the local interstellar cloud ( lic ) where the sun is now located , the `` g - cloud '' , and the apex cloud ( frisch 2003 ) .",
    "the velocity vector of each cloud is consistent with the cloud being located in front of the nearest star @xmath32 cen , although the g - cloud is the best fit to observations ( e.g. lallement et al .",
    "1995 , linsky & wood 1996 ) and the lic would have to have a small velocity gradient ( @xmath10.7 km / s ) towards the star . if the g - cloud is the next cloud to be encountered by the sun , the higher heliocentric velocity ( 29.1 km / s , factor of @xmath11.1 ) and neutral density ( @xmath35 , factor of @xmath324 ) than for the lic indicates a dramatic heliosphere shrinkage if the other properties ( e.g. ionization ) are similar to the lic ( frisch 2003 , zank & frisch 1999 ) .",
    "if , in contrast , the apex cloud is the next cloud encountered , the larger heliocentric velocity ( 35.1 ) also indicates a smaller heliosphere , although the other properties of this cloud are unknown .",
    "variations of the boundary conditions of the heliosphere are thus expected on timescales of less than 37,00045,000 years if either the g - cloud or apex cloud is foreground to @xmath32 cen .",
    "the primary results of this paper are estimates of filtration factors for h , he , n , o , ne , and ar , based on radiative transfer models of the local ism from sf02 , and fs03 . two radiative transfer equilibrium models of ism within @xmath13 pc of the sun ( models 2 and 8) yield predictions which match observations of ism inside ( he , puis , acrs ) and outside ( gas within @xmath13 pc towards @xmath5 cma ) of the solar system , for an assumed interstellar gas - phase o abundance of o / h=400 ppm ( fs03 ) .",
    "these models yield semi - empirical predictions for he , h , o , n , ar filtration factors which are consistent with theoretical predictions , within uncertainties , and predict interstellar densities @xmath10.20 , = 0.10  at the solar location .",
    "however , there are unexplained differences between the predictions of models 2 and 8 and observed pickup ion ne densities and the cloud temperature .",
    "if the astronomical constraints on the radiative transfer models are relaxed , alternate models become plausible . for example , if the 2 khz radio emission observed by voyager 1 , 2 is from the surrounding ism , the low electron density of model 25 ( @xmath10.06 ) is a better match although predicted interstellar abundances are unrealistic . for model 25 to be correct the radiation field intensity versus cloud geometry requires further study .",
    "the simple interstellar cloud geometry assumed for the underlying radiative transfer models may also prove inadequate .",
    "if the astronomical constraints prove incorrect ( e.g. the assumed interstellar gas - phase oxygen abundance ) , then the selection of the best models to describe the boundary conditions of the heliosphere may also change .    as better data on the ism inside and outside of the heliosphere become available , yielding more accurate boundary conditions for the heliosphere",
    ", heliosphere modeling will predict more reliable filtration factors for comparison with semi - empirical filtration factors utilizing interstellar modeling .",
    "the strength of the interstellar magnetic field outside of the heliosphere remains uncertain , but both low frequency radio emission events and the polarization of the light of nearby stars suggest the field orientation is parallel to the galactic plane and not the ecliptic plane , introducing a north / south heliosphere asymmetry .",
    "the second important conclusion of this paper is that the boundary conditions of the heliosphere change with time , and on timescales of @xmath210@xmath35 years , indicating past and future variations in heliosphere dimensions and properties .",
