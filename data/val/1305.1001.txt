    "the first lhc runs at 7 - 8 tev have led to the discovery of a candidate higgs boson and to the non observation of new particles or exotic phenomena : no signals of new physics have been found neither by direct production of new particles nor in electroweak precision tests nor in flavour physics .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) has so far been confirmed by experiment beyond all expectations .",
    "this is surprising since the hierarchy problem @xcite and , to some extent , the elegant wimp ( weakly interacting massive particle ) solution of dark matter strongly suggested the presence of new physics near the fermi scale . but",
    "as well known the hierarchy problem is one of `` naturalness '' : the sm theory is renormalizable , finite , well defined and predictive once the dependence on the cut off is absorbed in a redefinition of masses and couplings .",
    "thus the theory can indeed work in practice and the hierarchy problem only arises at the conceptual level if one looks at the cut off as a parameterization of our ignorance on the new physics that will modify the theory at large energy scales .",
    "the hierarchy problem is not the only naturalness problem in fundamental physics : the observed value of the cosmological constant @xmath3 also poses a tremendous , unsolved naturalness problem @xcite . yet",
    "the value of @xmath3 is close to the weinberg upper bound for galaxy formation @xcite . according to the anthropic point of view ,",
    "possibly our universe is just one of infinitely many bubbles ( multiverse ) continuously created from the vacuum by quantum fluctuations .",
    "different physics takes place in different universes according to the multitude of string theory solutions ( @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "perhaps we live in a very unlikely universe but the only one that allows our existence @xcite,@xcite . in the context of the sm",
    "one can argue against this view since plenty of models have been formulated that easily reduce the fine tuning from @xmath5 to @xmath6 : so why make our universe so terribly unlikely ?",
    "if to the sm we add , say , supersymmetry , does the universe become less fit for our existence ? by comparison the case of the cosmological constant is a lot different because the context is not as fully specified as for the sm    however , as the criterium of naturalness has so far failed , we are lacking at present a reliable argument on where precisely the new physics threshold should be located .",
    "because of the serious arguments against applying the anthropic philosophy to the sm , many still remain confident that some new physics will appear not too far from the weak scale ; still , given the failure so far to detect new physics , there has been a revival of models that ignore the fine tuning problem while trying to accommodate the known facts .",
    "for example , several fine tuned supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the sm have been studied like split susy @xcite or large scale susy @xcite .",
    "there have also been reappraisals of non susy grand unified theories ( gut ) where again one completely disregards fine tuning : in some recent papers @xcite several aspects of the problem have been discussed . here",
    "we would like to establish whether a relatively simple non susy @xmath0 gut extension of the sm exists which is able to reproduce all the really compelling data that demand new physics beyond the sm at scales at and below @xmath1 .",
    "we consider here a renormalizable model but in principle one could also study the same problem in @xmath0 versions where each large higgs representation is replaced by products of smaller field multiplets . in our resulting model the sm spectrum is completed by the just discovered light higgs and no other new physics is present in the lhc range . at the gut scale of @xmath7",
    "gev the unifying group is @xmath0 , broken down to the pati - salam group @xmath8 ( @xmath9 for shorthand ) , valid at an intermediate scale , typically @xmath10 gev .",
    "note that , in general , unification in @xmath11 would not work because a group of rank larger than 4 is required in order to allow for a two step ( at least ) breaking needed , in the absence of susy , to restore coupling unification and to avoid a too fast proton decay ( an alternative within @xmath11 is to assume some ad hoc intermediate threshold with a set of new particles that modify the evolution towards unification @xcite ) .",
    "the proposed non - susy @xmath0 model , with a single intermediate breaking scale @xmath12 between @xmath1 and the electroweak scale , is compatible with the following requirements :    * unification of couplings at a large enough scale @xmath1 compatible with the existing bounds on the proton life - time ; * a yukawa sector in agreement with all data on flavour physics , fermion masses and mixings , also including neutrinos , as well as with leptogenesis as the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe ; * an axion , which arises from the higgs sector of the model , suitable to solve the strong cp problem and account for the observed amount of dark matter .",
    "there is no item in the list concerning the onset of inflation in that we assume that the inflaton is a gravitationally coupled singlet ( or even a larger sector of particles ) without sm gauge interactions .",
    "it turns out that imposing all these requirements is very constraining , so that most of the possible breaking chains of @xmath0 must be discarded and the ps symmetry at the intermediate scale emerges as the optimal solution .",
    "we show that all these different phenomena can be satisfied in this fully specified , although schematic , gut model , with a single intermediate scale at @xmath13 gev .",
    "in fact , within this breaking chain , the see - saw and leptogenesis mechanisms can both be made compatible with @xmath13 gev , which is consistent with the theoretical lower limit on the lightest heavy right - handed neutrino for sufficient leptogenesis @xcite given by @xmath14 gev .",
    "the same intermediate scale @xmath15 is also suitable for the axion to reproduce the correct dark matter abundance .",
    "given the indicative character of our study we limit ourselves to leading order ( lo ) evolution , a relatively economic choice of @xmath0 higgs multiplets , a crude threshold matching and a sketchy approach to leptogenesis and to axions .",
    "we are aware that such a gut model is terribly fine tuned , because of its explicit hierarchy problem that is also manifest in the necessary huge splittings within the higgs multiplets ( a sort of generalized doublet - triplet splitting problem ) .",
    "we consider this model as an extreme reference case where a minimum of new physics is introduced to realize @xmath0 grand unification and to accommodate all unavoidable experimental requirements .",
    "note that , given the experimental values of @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the vacuum instability occurring in the sm near the intermediate scale @xmath19 @xcite is maintained in this model because below @xmath19 the coupling evolution is the same as in the sm . however the evolution is somewhat distorted above the intermediate scale .    based on the earlier results in @xcite , we are led to the following breaking chain : @xmath20 with the pati - salam ( ps ) group @xmath21 being the intermediate gauge symmetry group . for the breaking of @xmath0 to the ps group",
    "we adopt a @xmath22 of higgs , which gives suitable values for @xmath1 and @xmath12 .",
    "the representation 54 also leads to the ps intermediate group but it leaves the left - right symmetry unbroken and , moreover , the mass scales @xmath1 and @xmath12 turn out to be not appropriate . as discussed in sect . 3 different intermediate groups like @xmath23 or @xmath24 fail to end up with a running compatible with all the constraints ( we confirm and extend to our case the results of ref .",
    "the breaking down to the sm is achieved by using a @xmath25 ( and a less relevant @xmath26 ) and the final step to the @xmath27 is obtained by means of a @xmath28 . in order to have a suitable axion dark matter candidate we also introduce the @xmath26 representation , with a mass scale close to @xmath12 and a specified transformation property under a peccei - quinn symmetry .",
    "both @xmath25 and @xmath28 are also necessary to generate fermion masses ( for simplicity , we do not introduce a @xmath29 that , in principle , could also contribute to fermion masses ) .",
    "we perform a full 3-generation study of fermion masses and mixings .",
    "the previous works that are closest to the present approach are those in refs .",
    "we differ from ref .",
    "@xcite in the symmetry breaking chain ( those authors choose a 54 for the breaking at @xmath1 ) and for the additional representation @xmath26 involved in the pq symmetry .",
    "also they do not make a full 3-generation fit and do not discuss leptogenesis . in ref .",
    "@xcite there is a detailed fit of fermion masses but no discussion of leptogenesis , axions and the @xmath0 breaking chain .",
    "we differ from ref .",
    "@xcite in that the authors assume a particular form of lepton - quark symmetry , do not discuss the pq symmetry and do not perform a detailed fit of all fermion masses . finally , in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite the same yukawa sector as ours is considered but neither the implications for leptogenesis nor for axions are discussed .",
    "the dark matter problem is one of the strongest evidences for new physics . in this model",
    "it should be solved by axions @xcite .",
    "it must be said that axions have the problem that their mass should be adjusted to reproduce the observed amount of dark matter . in this respect",
    "the wimp solution , like the neutralinos in susy models , is more attractive because the observed amount of dark matter is more guaranteed in this case .",
    "neutrino masses and mixing originate in this gut extended sm from lepton number violation , majorana masses and the see - saw mechanism while baryogenesis occurs through leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "one should one day observe proton decay and neutrino - less beta decay .",
    "none of the alleged indications for new physics at colliders should survive ( in particular even the claimed muon ( g-2 ) discrepancy @xcite should be attributed , if not to an experimental problem , to an underestimate of the theoretical errors or , otherwise , to some specific addition to the model @xcite ) .",
    "this model is in line with the non observation of @xmath30 at meg @xcite , of the electric dipole moment of the neutron @xcite etc .",
    "it is a very important challenge to experiment to falsify this scenario by establishing a firm evidence of new physics at the lhc or at another `` low energy '' experiment .",
    "the plan of this article is as follows : in sect.[higgssection ] we elucidate the role of the various higgs representations useful for our purposes ; in sect.[evolsection ] we discuss the evolution of the gauge couplings from @xmath31 up to the gut scale , with the ps intermediate gauge group , and argue on why other possible breaking patterns are less suitable to accommodate the requirements listed in the above - mentioned points 1 - 3 .",
    "sect.4 is devoted to the study of the fit of the fermion masses , mixing and leptogenesis whereas in sect.5 we present the implication of our results on the mass and dark matter contribution of cold axions . in sect.6",
    "we draw our conclusions .",
    "in the following , we describe in more detail the @xmath0 representations needed to realize the program outlined above .",

    "the jump of @xmath35 at the intermediate scale @xmath12 is due to the fact that the generator of @xmath36 is a sum of terms from the two different factors @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the ps gauge group , with matching condition as given in eq.([match ] ) .    from the order of magnitude estimate of the proton lifetime , given by : [ eq : tau ] ~ , and by using the values of @xmath1 and @xmath39 obtained from our coupling evolution , we get : ^model ~510 ^ 36y , to be compared to the present experimental limit @xcite : ^exp(p e^+^0 ) 10 ^ 34 y. we see that the model is confortably consistent with the experimental limit .",
    "notice that the proton decay can also be mediated by colored scalar triplets contained in the @xmath25 representation with masses @xmath40 around the intermediate scale @xmath12 ; these contributions can be estimated as ( to be compared with eq.([eq : tau ] ) ) : ~ where @xmath41 is a product of coupling of the higgses to the fermions in the amplitudes for proton decay and @xmath40 is the mass of the higgses .",
    "since the color singlet component of the 15-dimensional higgs multiplet is a component of the physical higgs particle then also the colour triplet higgs boson couples to fermions proportionally to the fermion masses , modulo some clebsch - gordan factors .",
    "then one can expect that the largest contribution comes from a vertex with @xmath42 and @xmath43 quarks ( times a cabibbo suppression factor ) , thus causing the proton to decay into a @xmath44 meson and a lepton .",
    "we estimate : ~ , where @xmath45 is either @xmath46 or @xmath47 , defined in our eq.(4 ) , that we assume of the order of the electroweak scale . to give a lower bound on the triplet higgs mass",
    ", we compare the previous estimate with the experimental limit on @xmath48 or @xmath49 or @xmath50 , all with limits around @xmath51 y @xcite , and we derive m_t10 ^ 10 - 11gev .",
    "this bound can be easily satisfied in our model considering that the scalar triplets are expected to have masses around @xmath52 gev .",
    "a comparable result also holds for the colored higgs contributions to the @xmath53 channel . for this channel , both the prediction and the experimental bound on the life - time",
    "are larger .",
    "we have studied alternative breaking chains to verify whether they could be compatible with the requirements outlined in the introduction .",
    "if instead of using a @xmath22 to break @xmath0 down to the ps groups we had adopted a @xmath54 , the intermediate gauge group would have been @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a parity symmetry that enforces the left and right couplings to be equal from @xmath12 to @xmath1 . in this case , the higgs boson sector must be modified to become more left - right symmetric and the values of the mass scales and couplings would be changed .",
    "such a breaking chain has been already discussed in @xcite : from their analysis and the present bounds on the proton life - time this chain is ruled out .",
    "we have repeated the analysis , adding the @xmath57 multiplet of the @xmath58 representation and a @xmath26 ( or @xmath59 ) at the intermediate scale ( all not included in @xcite ) to get a viable axion candidate .",
    "we confirm that , with present data on the proton decay , the @xmath55 predicts a too short life - time , @xmath60 y. other interesting possibilities for the intermediate gauge groups are those involving @xmath61 , where @xmath62 . in this case , adding the contributions of @xmath63 of @xmath58 and that of @xmath64 of the @xmath26 ( or that of the @xmath65 of the @xmath59 ) , we always get a too small intermediate scale , @xmath66 gev , incompatible with the see - saw mechanism and difficult to reconcile with the axion explanation of dark matter .",
    "if the symmetry group also includes the @xmath56 parity , we get @xmath67 gev ( depending on whether we use the @xmath59 or @xmath26 , respectively ) and a value of the proton life - time roughly one - to - two orders of magnitude smaller than its present experimental bound .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath0 breaking chains @xmath68 , with or without p - parity , are not suitable to fulfill all the phenomenological constraints considered in this paper .",
    "fermion masses arise from the following yukawa interactions ( for economy of parameters we are omitting the possible contribution of a @xmath29 ) : l_y=16(h10_h+f_h)16 . where the coupling matrices @xmath69 and @xmath70 are complex symmetric matrices . recalling the vev definitions in eqs .",
    "[ vev1 ] , [ vev2 ] the fermion mass matrices of the model have the following form : m_u = hk_u + fv_u , & & m_d = hk_d + fv_d + & [ masses ] & + m^d_= hk_u -3 fv_u , & & m_l = hk_d -3 fv_d , m^m_= fv_r.we can rewrite the previous expressions in a more compact form , suitable for a fit to masses and mixing angles : m_u = r_v ( h+s f ) , & & m_d= h+f + & & + m^d_=r_v ( h-3s f ) & & m_l = h-3 f m^m_= r_r^-1 f , where @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "since the charged lepton masses are known with high accuracy , we prefer to express @xmath76 and the neutrino matrices in terms of @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( the latter with eigenvalues at @xmath1 given by @xcite @xmath79=0.46965 mev , @xmath80=99.1466 mev and @xmath81=1.68558 gev ) as follows @xcite : m_u&=&r_v ( m_d+ m_l ) , + m^d_&=&r_v ( m_d+ m_l),[tofit ] + m^m_&= & ( m_d - m_l )",
    ".    with respect to the existing literature , in our fit we also add the additional requirement of a quantitatively successful leptogenesis @xcite : @xmath82 the obvious way to compute the baryon - to - photon number ratio would be to implement the boltzmann equations in the fit and then evaluate @xmath83 following , for example , the prescription given in refs .",
    "@xcite . however , this procedure is too long and complicated for the precision we are aiming to in this work .",
    "instead , we can use approximate expressions , depending on the heavy neutrino spectrum of the theory .",
    "for example , since leptogenesis is expected to occur at a temperature of the order of @xmath19 , if @xmath84 gev only the @xmath85 yukawa coupling is in equilibrium and the muon and electron asymmetries are indistinguishable . in this case",
    "one can adopt a two - flavor approach with only @xmath86 contributing to the asymmetry if the right - handed spectrum satisfies the condition @xmath87 or adding the @xmath88 contribution if @xmath89 .",
    "since the heavy spectrum and the dirac mass matrix are not known _ a priori _ , that is before making the fit to the observables at the gut scale , we adopt the following general algorithm :    * we assume to work with a given number of flavours and _ active _ right - handed neutrinos ; * in the fit we implement simplified solutions of the boltzmann equations ( see , for instance , @xcite ) ; * after the fit , we check _ a posteriori _ that the adopted assumptions in step @xmath90 are correct ; * in the case of a positive answer , we use the heavy spectrum and the dirac mass matrix obtained from the fit to solve numerically the boltzmann equations and get a more precise determination of @xmath83 .    obviously ,",
    "if the assumptions in @xmath90 are not correct , we have to modify our approximate formulae and run the chain again .",
    "it has been emphasized in @xcite that in @xmath0 with see - saw and renormalizable yukawa couplings , there is a strict quark - lepton relation not very suitable for implementing the mechanism of baryogenesis through leptogenesis .",
    "in fact , the hierarchy of the eigenvalues of the dirac mass matrix @xmath91 , implied by the quark - lepton connection , implies a strong hierarchy among the heavy right - handed neutrinos via the see - saw formula and this , in general , produces a too small lightest right - handed mass to generate a successful leptogenesis . for a possible way out",
    "we assume the easiest possibility , that is that @xmath92 and @xmath88 are sufficiently close in mass to contribute both to @xmath83 ; we further assume to work in the two - flavour regime , since we expect the lightest right - handed neutrinos with mass of the order of @xmath52 gev , then in a range where only the @xmath85 yukawa coupling is in equilibrium .    to estimate the number of independent parameters we proceed as follows",
    ". eq.([masses ] ) contains 24 real parameters in @xmath69 and @xmath70 and 5 ( in principle ) complex yukawas , for a total of 34 parameters .",
    "working in the basis where the charged leptons are diagonal allows to remove 3 angles and 6 phases contained in the unitary matrix w such that @xmath93 , so we are left with 25 parameters . from eq.([tofit ] ) we see that the 7 quantities @xmath94 only appear in the 3 combinations @xmath95 and @xmath96 , so we have 6 and not 10 parameters , which means 21 independent parameters .",
    "moreover , since @xmath97 and @xmath96 appear as overall factors in eq.([tofit ] ) , they can be taken as real , so the total number of parameters is 19 , of which 7 are phases : 12 in the down mass matrix , 3 in the charged lepton mass matrix , 2 contained in the complex @xmath43 parameter and one each in @xmath97 and @xmath96 .",
    "we do not fit neither the lepton masses nor @xmath96 so , in total , we have to estimate 15 real parameters ( 12 in the down mass matrix , 2 contained in the complex @xmath43 parameter and the real @xmath97 ) to fit the 15 observables summarized in tab.[obs ] _ and _ in eq.([eq : yb_cmb ] ) .",
    "the relations in eq.([tofit ] ) hold at the gut scale , so we have to take into account the standard model running of the quark masses and mixing and charged leptons masses from low energies up to @xmath1 ; for a precise calculation , the contribution of the higgs states with masses around @xmath12 ( see tab.[evol ] ) can not be ignored for the running from @xmath12 to @xmath1 ; however , their effect amounts to a minor correction because the corresponding beta function coefficients are not large and the running involves a logarithmic dependence on the ratio @xmath98 which is quite smaller than @xmath99 .",
    "the values of the fermion masses at @xmath1 reported in tab.[obs ] are taken from @xcite ; for the neutrino parameters ( @xmath100 ad @xmath101 ) we used the recent results in @xcite and for the ckm parameters the ones quoted in @xcite .",
    "although the last two sets of observables are taken at the lowest mass scale in the running , we do not expect in this case sizable corrections in the evolution , as it can be appreciated comparing our tab.[obs ] with table vi in @xcite . notice that for the data with asymmetric 1@xmath102 error",
    ", we take the value in the center of the interval as the best fit and consider a symmetric 1@xmath102 interval .",
    "this simplifying choice has a negligible impact on the results of our fit .",
    "[ ht ] @xmath103    to check whether the model is able to reproduce the experimental values of fermion masses , mixing and @xmath83 , we perform a @xmath104 analysis using : [ chi2 ] ^2=_i ( ) ^2  , where the @xmath105 denote the theoretical values of the observables and the @xmath106 are the experimental values extrapolated to @xmath1 ( with @xmath107 being the corresponding 1@xmath102 uncertainties ) .",
    "we get a reasonably good minimum of the @xmath104 , namely , for 15 data points : ^2_min=17.4 ; the best fit solutions ( and the related pulls ) of the observables are given in tab.[res ] .",

    "one could argue that an extra source of error on the quark masses can well arise from the distortions on the mass evolution induced by the deformed evolution with respect to the sm that occur above @xmath12 . on the other hand , the tendency of the atmospheric angle to drift toward small values ( compared to the input in tab.[obs ] ) ,",
    "is mainly due to the stringent requirement of a successful leptogenesis theories to favor small atmospheric mixing , at least in the 2-family case @xcite . ] .",
    "in fact , as a check , we have redone the fit only including the 14 observables in tab.[obs ] .",

    "note that our fit has no degrees of freedom ( 15 observables vs 15 parameters ) : due to the high non linearity of the problem there is no perfect matching but the average squared deviation @xmath115 is of order 1 .",
    "we are also in the position to make a list of predictions including the light neutrino masses , the heavy right - handed masses , the values of the three cp - violating phases ( the dirac @xmath116 and the two majorana phases @xmath117 , extracted according to the convention used in @xcite ) and the value of the effective mass in the neutrinoless double beta decay rate , @xmath118 .",

    "we fix @xmath156 mev and @xmath157 mev and take @xmath158 ; with the parameter @xmath159 in the interval @xmath160 , we get @xmath161 ev , compatible with astrophysical bounds @xcite . in the case where inflation occurs after the pq phase transition , the cosmological energy density of cold axions can be estimated from @xcite : [ omega ] _ a h^2 0.7 ( ) ^()^2 where @xmath69 is the present - day hubble expansion parameter and @xmath162 is the `` initial misalignment angle '' , varying in the interval @xmath163 . in order to estimate whether our axions are able to fill the experimental bound @xcite : [ bound ] _ a h^2 = 0.1199 0.0027 we use eq.([omega ] ) with @xmath155 and @xmath162 as free parameters and plot the region where the bound ( [ bound ] ) is satisfied at 3@xmath102 level .",
    "this is shown in fig.([fig : ax2 ] ) ; since @xmath155 should be of the order of @xmath12 , where the pq symmetry is broken , we consider the range @xmath164 , enclosed in the horizontal lines .",
    "parameter space where the energy density of cold axions saturates eq.([bound ] ) at 3@xmath102 level .",
    "the horizontal lines correspond to @xmath165 and @xmath166.__,width=340 ]    as we can see , values of @xmath155 close to @xmath12 are perfectly viable to make the axion of our model the relevant component of the cold dark matter , at least for values of @xmath167 .    in the case where inflation occurs after the pq phase transition ( the situation we discussed above ) , the axion is subject to quantum fluctuations , which leaves a distinctive imprint on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) spectrum .",
    "when the temperature is comparable to @xmath168 , such fluctuations induce non - vanishing density perturbations and then a contribution to the total power spectrum of the cmb .",
    "the recent planck results @xcite are in tension with the axion contribution to the cmb computed for the values of @xmath162 and @xmath155 of our model .",
    "however , there are several ways to avoid this constraint , such as , for example , invoking an axion decay constant during inflation larger than the present one @xcite , or theories where the scalar fields are coupled to gravity in a non - minimal way @xcite , or even scenarios in which the qcd coupling becomes large at an intermediate or high energy scale in the very early universe @xcite .",
    "the sm has passed all sorts of tests at colliders and the general expectation of discovering new physics at the lhc has been so far frustrated . yet",
    "the sm can not explain a number of phenomena like dark matter , baryogenesis and neutrino majorana masses not to mention dark energy , inflation and quantum gravity . due to these problems",
    "the horizon of particle physics must necessarily be extended up to @xmath1 and even to @xmath169 .",
    "a suitable arena for enlarging the sm to very large energy scales is provided by gut s . in particular @xmath0 gut s",
    "are very attractive with the spectacular success of the 16 dimensional representation that reproduces the quantum numbers of all the fermions in one generation , including the right handed neutrinos . in this work",
    "we have studied a non susy @xmath0 gut that could extend the validity of the sm up to @xmath1 describing fermion masses and mixings , majorana masses , neutrinos with see - saw , baryogenesis and dark matter explained by axions .",
    "the possibility of accommodating all compelling phenomena that demand new physics below @xmath1 in a non susy @xmath0 model is highly non trivial .",
    "in fact , it singles out a particular breaking chain with a pati - salam symmetry at an intermediate mass scale @xmath13 gev .",
    "we have shown that a reasonable fit to the data can be obtained in this framework ; of course , the price to pay is a very large level of fine tuning . as our goal was to establish an existence proof rather than a completely realistic model , we believe that the rough approximations used for the running and the matching can be considered as adequate for our purposes . in general the idea of an @xmath0 gut is very appealing but all its practical realizations are clumsy , more so in the non susy case because of the hierarchy problem and the need of an intermediate symmetry breaking scale in order to obtain a precise coupling unification and a large enough unification scale to be compatible with the existing bounds on proton decay .",
    "we discussed here a renormalizable model .",
    "alternatively one could allow for non renormalizable couplings in order to work with smaller higgs representations .",
    "we see no obstacle in principle to produce a successful model also in this case , but we leave it for further study . in conclusion",
    "we have considered worthwhile to study the possibility of an all - comprehensive version of non susy @xmath0 gut and we have built and compared in detail with experiment an example of such a theory .",
    "we want to thank enrico nardi for useful clarifications about the leptogenesis mechanism , michal malinsky for illuminating discussions on technical aspects of the @xmath0 gauge group and gian giudice and luca merlo for useful discussions and comments .",
    "we acknowledge miur ( italy ) for financial support under the programs prin 2008 and `` futuro in ricerca 2010 ( rbfr10o36o ) '' and the european commission , under the networks lhcphenonet and invisibles .",
    "here we list the best fit values of the 15 parameters used in our fit procedure .",
    "the 12 elements in @xmath77 are as follows : m_d ( gev)= (      ) , the complex parameter @xmath43 and the real parameter @xmath97 are : s=(.37,-.079 ) r_v=60.03",
