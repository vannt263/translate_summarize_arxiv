    "from the dawn of civilization , sun is revered and held as an awe inspiring celestial object in the sky . in the world",
    ", there are many stories and poems woven around the sun god in different folklores and the magnificent architectures are dedicated to the mighty sun .",
    "the flora and fauna on the earth mainly depends on the sun for their survival .",
    "recent observational evidences are building up that even the unpredictable climates and rainfalls of the earth are excited and are maintained by the sun s influence ( reid 1999 ; shine 2000 ; hiremath and mandi 2004 and references there in ; soon 2005 ; hiremath 2006a , 2006c ; haigh 2007 ; perry 2007 ; feymann 2007 ; tiwari and ramesh 2007 and references there in ; scafetta and west 2008 ; hiremath 2009 ; agnihotri , dutta and soon 2011 ) .",
    "analysis of vast stretch in time of the paleoclimatic records show that the sun s activity is imprinted in the global temperature and precipitation variabilities . the imminent influence ( hiremath and mandi 2004 and references there in ; hiremath 2009 and references there in ) of the sun also can be traced in the well documented instrumental rainfall records .    among all the distant stars ,",
    "the sun is very closest to us and is apparently @xmath0 100 billion times brighter than any other star . thus owing to it s proximity and brilliance ,",
    "the sun can be closely studied in details ; like it s chemical composition , thermal and dynamic structures of the interior , etc .",
    "the sun is a gigantic cosmic laboratory where one can test the physical phenomena discovered on the earth .",
    "hence the sun is very important astronomical object that needs to be studied carefully .",
    "if we understand the sun , we can understand the distant stars and physics of whole universe .    in the recent decade",
    ", helioseismology - a tool to probe the solar internal structure and dynamics - has changed our conventional perception of the internal structure and dynamics .",
    "observational evidences show that sun oscillates over a wide range of periods that range from minutes to perhaps on time scales of centuries .",
    "observations from the ground ( gong , bison , iris , _ etc . , _ ) and from the space ( like soho , hinode , stereo , etc . , ) provided solar oscillation frequency data with very high precision .    before the advent of helioseismology",
    ", sun s internal thermal structure was understood from the _ standard solar model_. a standard solar model is built from the evolutionary calculations of stellar structure equations ( conservation of mass , momentum and energy and supplemented with known equation of state , knowledge of transfer of energy by convection in the outer part of the sun , equation of nuclear energy generation and nature of opacity of the solar internal plasma ) that ultimately mimic the sun s present age , mass and radius respectively .",
    "as for the dynamical structure , earlier studies concentrated on studying the rotation rate of the solar core as this parameter is related to evolutionary history of angular momentum of the sun and its influence on the orbit of nearby planet mercury for testing the einstein s general theory of relativity .",
    "similarly , models based on the turbulent @xmath1 dynamo mechanism required that radial part of the angular velocity should increase from the surface towards the interior in order to reproduce the correct sunspot butterfly diagrams . on the other hand ,",
    "results of non - linear hydrodynamical simulations ( gilman and miller 1981 ) show that angular velocity decreases from the surface towards the interior .",
    "these simulations also yield internal rotational isocontours that have cylindrical geometry .",
    "however , it will be known from the following sections that the helioseismic inferences yield entirely different picture of the rotational profile in the solar interior .",
    "we will also know from the helioseismic inferences and modeling that the thermal structure ( such as pressure , temperature , etc .",
    ", ) of the solar interior is almost similar to the structure obtained from the _ standard solar model _",
    ", although recent surface chemical abundances and hence helioseismic inferences yield the substantial disagreement .    plan of this presentation is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "a brief introduction to the observational aspects of the sun is presented .",
    "recent discoveries of the sun s oscillations from the ground and space are presented in section 3 .",
    "section 4 is devoted to inferences of thermal , dynamic and magnetic field structures of the sun s interior .",
    "concluding remarks are presented in the last section . in this presentation",
    ", i mainly concentrate on the _ global seismology _ to infer global large scale structure of the sun s interior although one can also infer near surface structure from the _ local helioseismology_.",
    "important physical parameters of the sun are : ( i ) mass-@xmath2 kg , ( ii ) radius-@xmath3 meter , ( iii ) mean density-1409 kg@xmath4 , ( iv ) temperature at the photosphere-5780 @xmath5 and , ( v ) the total amount of energy radiated by the sun ( i.e. , luminosity ) measured at one astronomical unit ( i.e. , distance between the earth and the sun)-@xmath6 joules / sec .",
    "when one considers the vertical cross section of the sun parallel to it s rotation axis , based on the dynamical and physical properties , solar interior mainly can be classified into three distinct zones : ( i ) _ the radiative core _ where the energy is mainly generated by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium and is transfered by the radiation , ( ii ) _ the convection zone _ where the energy is transferred from the center to the surface by the convection of the plasma and , ( iii ) _ the photosphere _ where the energy is radiated into the space . above the photosphere , the sun s atmosphere consists of the _ chromosphere _ and the _ corona_. the temperature increases from the layer of photosphere to million degree kelvin in the corona .",
    "if the sun were static in time with a constant output of energy , the planetary environments in general and the earth s environment in particular would have received the constant output of energy .",
    "however , the sun s energy output is variable due to spatial and temporal variability of the sun s large scale magnetic field structure , dynamics and flow of mass ( both the neutral and charged particles ) from the sun .",
    "the most outstanding activity of the sun is _",
    "sunspots_- cool and dark features compared to the ambient medium - on the sun s surface that modulate sun s irradiance and the galactic cosmic rays that enter the planetary environments .",
    "variation of the occurrence of number of sunspots over the surface of the sun with an average periodicity of @xmath0 11 years is termed as sunspot or solar cycle .",
    "as the sunspots are bipolar magnetic field regions with positive and negative polarities , every 11 years polarity changes and , by 22 years , sunspots reverse back to their original polarities .",
    "this constitutes the 22 year sun s magnetic cycle .",
    "the _ flares _ that are mainly associated with the sunspots ( hiremath 2006b ) release the vast amount of energy ( upto @xmath7 joules ) with in a short span of time .",
    "the sun also ejects sporadically the mass ( @xmath0 @xmath8 gm ) of plasma to the space and such an event is called _ coronal mass ejection_. there is also a continuous flow of wind ( @xmath9 charged particles per second or @xmath10 billion tons per hour ) from the sun towards the space called the _",
    "solar wind_.    the sun s activity varies on time scales of few minutes to months , years to decades and perhaps more than centuries .",
    "the solar different activity indices vary on the time scales of @xmath0 27 days due to solar rotation and @xmath0 150 days due to the flares .",
    "unlike the earth , sun rotates differentially , rotating faster near the equator compared to the regions near the poles .",
    "the 1.3 year periodicity is predominant in different solar activity indices . the next prominent and ubiquitous _ viz . ,",
    "_ 11 year solar cycle periodicity is found not only in the present day sun s activity indices but also in the past evolutionary history derived from the solar proxies ( such as @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively ) .",
    "occurrence of transient events , such as either flares or coronal mass ejections , of the solar activity that are directed towards the earth create havoc in the earth s atmosphere by disrupting the global communication , reducing life time of the low - earth - orbit satellites and , cause electric power outages .",
    "owing to sun s immense influence of space weather effects on the earth s environment and climate , it is necessary to predict ( hiremath 2008 ) and know in advance different physical parameters such as amplitude and period of the future solar cycles .",
    "in a gravitationally stratified and compressible medium such as sun and with vigorous convective activity in the convective envelope , different types of oscillation modes can be excited .",
    "for example , noise due to turbulence , especially in the convective envelope , perturb ( goldreich and kumar 1988 ) gradients of pressure and excite the sound waves or _",
    "p modes _ that alternatively consist of compressions and rarefactions and , travel with the velocity of local sound speed . where as perturbations of the stable radiative core excite _ gravity or g _ modes and are due to vertical displacement of a parcel of fluid from its normal position . in principle ,",
    "these two types of waves can be observed on the surface of the sun through surface displacement of velocities ( by doppler shifts of the spectrum ) or intensity ( temperature ) variations .",
    "oscillations of the sun s photosphere were first discovered in the early 1960s ( leighton 1960 ; leighton _ et .",
    "al . _ 1962 ) .",
    "doppler shifts of the spectral lines formed in the atmosphere revealed the period of oscillations of about five minutes .",
    "later it was discovered ( deubner 1975 ) from theoretical investigations ( ulrich 1970 ; leibacher and stein 1971 ) that these oscillations are due to superposition of large number of individual modes each having its own characteristics frequency .",
    "surface observations indicate the velocity fluctuations are @xmath0 1000 m / sec . where as amplitude of individual modes ranges from 0.3 m / sec to 0.01 m / sec ( fig 1 ) .",
    "some of the groups ( severney _ et .",
    "al . _ 1976 ; kotov _ et .",
    "_ 1978 ; scherrer _ et.al . _",
    "1979 ; scherrer and wilcox 1983 ) reported the oscillations that may represent internal gravity modes .",
    "observations of whole disc doppler velocities revealed an oscillation with a period 160.01 minute that is believed to be a _",
    "mode oscillation of the sun .",
    "thus new era in the history of solar physics _ viz . , _ seismology of the sun or _ helioseismology _",
    "( as this term is initially coined by severny _ et .",
    "al . _ 1979 ) has started that is yielding rich dividends on physics of the sun s interior .     on the unit sphere and its nodal lines .",
    "@xmath13 is equal to @xmath14 along @xmath15 great circles passing through the poles , and along @xmath16 circles of equal latitude .",
    "the function changes sign each time it crosses one of these lines .",
    "this figure is adopted from wikipedia .",
    ", width=302,height=302 ]      in spherical coordinates , one can express velocity @xmath17 of oscillation in a specific normal mode as the real part of @xmath18 where @xmath19 is spherical harmonic function of degree @xmath20 and azimuthal order @xmath15 , @xmath21 is co - latitude and @xmath22 is longitude of the sun .    for each pair of @xmath20 and @xmath15 , there is a discrete spectrum of modes with distinct frequency @xmath23 .",
    "these differ in spatial structures as a function of radius . @xmath24",
    "are the eigen functions which are oscillatory in space and typically possess @xmath25 zeros or nodes in the radial direction .",
    "the degree @xmath20 can be understood as the number of complete circles on the surface of a star where the normal component of velocity is always zero .",
    "the angular degree @xmath20 is related to the total horizontal component of the wave number , @xmath26 as @xmath27^{1/2}}{r_{\\odot } } \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the radius of the star .",
    "thus high degree @xmath20 modes sense the near surface structure and very low degree @xmath20 modes sense near center of the sun .",
    "thus with different degree modes observed on the surface , one can infer the internal structure of sun .",
    "the azimuthal order m , characterizes the orientation of the mode relative to the axis of the spherical coordinate system and has @xmath29 values ( _ i.e. , _",
    "the zero velocity lines are like lines of latitude when @xmath31 and are like lines of longitude when @xmath32 . when @xmath31 , the spherical harmonic is called as _ zonal harmonics _ and the harmonic with @xmath33 is called _",
    "sectoral harmonics_. _ tesseral harmonics _ is obtained when @xmath34 ( see fig 2 ) .",
    "there are two ways , viz .",
    ", _ unimaged _ and _ imaged _ methods , of measuring the amplitudes and frequencies of 5 min oscillations ( hill , deubner and isaak 1991 ) . in case of _ unimaged _ method , oscillations are due to low-@xmath20 modes that are obtained from the integrated whole disk measurements .",
    "these modes have longer life times ( @xmath0 of months ) and hence their frequencies can be accurately measured .",
    "modes ( deubner and gough 1984).,width=377,height=302 ]    fig 3 illustrates an example of low-@xmath20 power spectrum obtained from birmingham integrated whole disk measurements .",
    "one can notice from fig 3 that , significant power lies between the 1 - 5 mhz . from the spherical fourier analysis , it is concluded that these observed oscillations are identified as low degree ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) and low radial order ( @xmath37 ) acoustic modes that penetrate deeply the solar interior .",
    "-5 cm   modes for the modes @xmath38 are illustrated ( libbrecht 1988).,title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=302 ]    as for the measured amplitudes of oscillations in doppler velocity , it depends upon the choice of the spectral lines ( that occur at different heights ) used for sensing the oscillations . for example , in potassium and sodium lines , maximum amplitudes from the power spectra are estimated to be @xmath0 15 and 25 @xmath39 respectively . in case of irradiance , amplitude of oscillations is estimated to be @xmath0 2 - 3 x @xmath40 .",
    "one can get the tables of amplitudes of oscillations from the observations of doppler velocity measurements ( grec _ et .",
    "al . _ 1983",
    "; palle _ et.al .",
    "_ 1989 ; and anguera guba _ et .",
    "al . _ 1990 ) .    in case of",
    "_ imaged _ method , amplitudes and frequencies of the solar oscillations are computed from the spatially resolved disk of the sun . with this method ,",
    "amplitudes and frequencies of many individual modes can be computed .",
    "for example , from the information of measured amplitudes , one can get the information of power and energy per mode . for the degree @xmath38 , power and energy per mode of oscillations as a function of frequency",
    "are illustrated in fig 4 .",
    "another useful physical parameter measured from the _ nonimaged _ and _ imaged _ observations is the line width of different oscillation modes that provide vital information of excitation and damping mechanism of the solar oscillations .",
    "measurements of line widths suggests that line width increases with both the frequency ( @xmath23 ) and degree ( @xmath20 ) of the oscillations .",
    "for example , for @xmath38 , in fig 4 , fwhm ( full width at half maximum ) of the line widths as a function of frequency is illustrated .",
    "when one compares the observations of line width as a function of frequency and theoretical estimates ( goldreich and kumar 1988 ; kumar _ et .",
    "al_. 1988 ; kumar and goldreich 1989 ; dalsgaard _ et .",
    "1989 ) , it is found that growth of the individual modes probably is constrained by the perturbations of the oscillations rather than non - linear interaction among the individual modes .",

    "such a l-@xmath23diagnostic power spectrum is illustrated . in this figure",
    ", one can notice that maximum power is concentrated near a frequency of 3 mhz that corresponds to a period of 5 minutes .",
    "another notable interesting characteristic property of this l-@xmath23 diagnostic diagram is that concentration of power is not distributed randomly , rather it is systematically concentrated in the narrow curved ridges indicating that observed oscillations are due to internal standing waves ( confined within the resonant cavity ) whose amplitudes vary from central core to near the surface .      in the previous section , solar power spectrum",
    "is presented by removing the effect of rotation .",
    "presence of rotation , coriolis force and magnetic field of the sun affect on the dynamics of the oscillations and hence on the frequencies .",
    "for example , if the sun is not rotating , non - magnetic and spherically symmetric , then the modes with same @xmath25 and @xmath20 , oscillation frequencies would be degenerate in azimuthal order @xmath15 . however , sun is rotating and magnetic resulting in lifting the degeneracy that makes the frequencies depend upon the azimuthal order @xmath15 . in case of sun , compared to magnitudes of rotation and magnetic field structures ,",
    "effects due to coriolis and centrifugal forces are negligible . from the observed data ,",
    "rotational frequency splittings are computed as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is average frequency for @xmath31 . in fig 6 ,",
    "typical power spectrum of solar oscillations , for different @xmath15 with @xmath38 , obtained from the big bear solar observatory ( libbrecht 1989 ) is presented .",
    "clearly one can notice the frequency splittings due to rotation in this illustration .",
    "traditionally frequency splittings are related to frequency @xmath44 of a mode as follows @xmath45 where @xmath46 are the splitting coefficients and @xmath47 are the polynomials related to clebsch - gordon coefficients . odd degree",
    "splitting coefficients @xmath48 are due to rotational effects and the combined effects ( of perturbations due to magnetic field structure , structural asphericities and second order effect due to rotation ) contribute to the even degree splitting coefficients .",
    "since the discovery of sunspots by galileo , scientists quest is to understand the physics of the sun s interior . from the helioseismic observations , one can precisely estimate the frequencies and their splittings of different modes of oscillations .",
    "for example , by knowing difference between computed theoretical and observationally estimated frequencies , one can infer thermal structure such as internal sound speed and density of the solar interior .",
    "where as the frequency splittings are used for the inference of internal dynamics ( such as steady and time dependent parts of rotation and angular momentum ) and magnetic field structures respectively .",
    "thermal structure of the solar interior can be understood in the following two ways . by using information of macro and micro physics of the solar interior ,",
    "compute theoretical frequencies ( dalsgaard 2003 ; unno _ et . al _ 1989 ) and match with the observed frequencies .",
    "macrophysics involves standard hydrodynamic equations that are to be linearized and the perturbed variables are assumed to vary with @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is angular frequency .",
    "where as micro physics requires other additional details of the solar interior , _ viz .",
    "_ , equation of state , opacity and rate of nuclear energy generation .",
    "using macro and micro physics , with additional knowledge of physics of the convection , solar internal structure such as pressure , temperature , density , etc . , are computed .",
    "as the observed amplitudes of oscillations are very small , equation of energy can be neglected and , linearized adiabatic equations with appropriate boundary conditions are used to compute the theoretical frequencies and are matched ( dalsgaard 2003 ; unno _ et .",
    "al _ 1989 ) with the observed frequencies .",
    "although most of the observed frequencies perfectly match very well for the low and intermediate degree modes , computed frequencies do not match very well with the high degree modes .",
    "possibly this suggests our poor knowledge of physics of near surface effects .      in another method ,",
    "observed frequencies and model of the solar structure are used to invert the thermal structure ( for example , sound speed and density ) of the solar interior in the following way .",
    "for the case of adiabatic oscillations , with additional constraint of conservation of mass , generalized form of equation ( lynden - bell and ostriker 1967 ; gough and taylor 1984 ; unno _ et .",
    "_ 1989 ; dalsgaard 2003 ) of oscillation that takes into account the effects of velocity flows @xmath51 and magnetic field structure @xmath52 is given as follows @xmath53 = 0 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath54 @xmath55 \\ , , \\ ]",

    "although effects due to flows and magnetic field structure in the solar interior can not be neglected , for simplicity , these terms are neglected and with special boundary conditions such that density and pressure perturbations completely vanish at the surface , equation ( 4 ) leads to the form @xmath65 . this equation is an eigen value problem and is also hermitian .",
    "hence , variational principle ( chandrasekhar 1964 ; see also unno _ et .",
    "1989 ) can be used to linearize the equation and frequency difference @xmath66 between the sun and standard solar structure model can be represented ( basu 2010 and references there in ) as follows @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are kernels that involve eigen functions of the oscillations and the known solar structure .",
    "other terms @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the differences of sound speed and density between the sun and the reference solar structure model .",
    "the last term ( see for details basu 2010 ) is a correction due to surface effects and does not arise due to linearization .",
    "hence , from the observed oscillation frequencies and with the known reference solar structure model , one can invert radial profiles of @xmath70 and @xmath71 in the solar interior .",
    "there are many inversion techniques ( gough and thompson 1991 ; unno _ et .",
    "_ 1989 ; dalsgaard 2002 and references there in ) to infer these profiles and one such inversion that yields the differences of sound speed and density ( between the sun and the solar structure model ) is presented ( basu _ et .",
    "_ 2009 ) in fig 7 .",
    "it is interesting to note that most of the models ( basu 2010 and references there in ) almost match with the reference solar structure models , yet there are unexplained statistically significant sound speed differences mainly near base of the convection zone and in the radiative core .",
    "similarly , density profile of solar structure models developed so far do not match very well with the density profile of the real sun .",
    "all of the solar structure models require the surface chemical heavy elemental abundances @xmath72 ( or ratio @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the hydrogen abundance ) that indirectly contribute to the equation of state and the opacity and hence , ultimately affect the computed frequencies , modeled sound speed and density structures .",
    "most of these models ( basu 2010 and references there in ) used the heavy elemental abundance ratio ( @xmath73=0.0229 ) by grevesse and noels ( 1993 ) . however , recent determination ( asplund _ et.al . _ 2000 , 2004 ; allende prieto _ et.al _ 2001 , 2002 ) lowered this ratio ( @xmath73 = 0.0166 ) leading to further deterioration of match between sound speed of the sun and different models .",
    "hence , this conundrum of unexplained differences of thermal structures of sound speed and density is remained to be explained .      by knowing the reference solar structure model , in the previous section , observed frequencies are used to compute the thermal structure differences of sound speed and the density . from these differences and knowing the sound speed and density structures as determined by the reference models , one can obtain sound speed and density profiles of the sun . as the sound speed and",
    "the density structures are thermodynamic quantities , in the following , using stellar structure equations ( with additional information of equation of state and the opacity structures ) , one can uniquely obtain the thermal structure of the solar interior .",
    "there are two advantages of this solar seismic model , as in the standard solar models , ( i ) no assumption of history of the sun and , ( ii ) no need to have adhock computation of the convective flux .",
    "in addition , chemical compositions such as hydrogen and helium abundances are obtained as part of solution .",
    "thus , in essence , this seismic model yields a snap shot model of the present day sun .",
    "for example , if equation of state of the solar plasma is available , inverted sound speed can be constrained to yield the ratio @xmath75 ( where @xmath76 is temperature and @xmath77 is the mean atomic weight ) . following are the four set of stellar structure differential equations that need to be solved by imposing sound speed obtained by the primary inversions @xmath78",

    "it is assumed that sun is in mechanical and thermal equilibrium such that whatever energy generated in the deep radiative core must be transported to the surface .",
    "however this latter condition can not be guaranteed .    as the sound speed is thermodynamically determined quantity , it is a function of other three variables , _ viz .",

    "although deduced profiles of thermal structure are almost similar to the profiles of solar standard models , there is no guarantee that these deductions satisfy the observed luminosity and the mass . by considering the inverted sound speed ( takata and shibahashi 1998 ) for the whole region from center to the surface , a global seismic model ( shibahashi , hiremath and takata 1998a ; shibahashi , hiremath and takata 1998b ; shibahashi , hiremath and takata 1999 )",

    "the rotational shear near base of convection zone , where the transition from differential rotation to rigid body rotation occurs , is called _ tachocline _ where the seat of so called _ dynamo _ ( that is believed to be origin and maintenance of solar cycle and activity phenomena ) is supposed to exist ( hiremath 2010 ; hiremath and lovely 2012 and references there in ) . however , yet it is not completely understood how the sun attained such a rotational structure in its interior .",
    "recent observations suggest that the entire universe is pervaded by a large scale weak uniform magnetic field structure ( ryu _ et.al . _",

    ", magnetic field structure might have played a dominant role in transferring angular momentum to the solar system .",
    "this could be one of the main reasons why most of the angular momentum is concentrated in the solar system rather than in the sun .",
    "it is believed that 22 yr magnetic cycle is due to so called dynamo mechanism that is the result of interplay of convection and rotation on the large scale poloidal magnetic field structure although there are other alternative views ( hiremath 2010 ; hiremath and lovely 2012 ) .",
    "signatures of both the poloidal and toroidal magnetic field structures can be found in the observed even degree frequency splittings .",
    "in addition , second order rotational effect ( where as first order or linear rotational effect is sensed by the odd degree frequency splittings as given in section 4.2 ) and aspherical sound speed perturbations ( kuhn 1988 ) also contribute to the even degree frequency splittings .",
    "hence , by assuming that aspherical sound speed perturbations are negligible , with the internal rotational structure as inferred from the helioseismology ( section 4.2 ) , contribution due to second order rotational effects is computed and is subtracted from the even degree frequency splittings and , resulting residual of even degree splittings are compared with the computed frequency splittings due to assumed magnetic field structure .",

    "presence of such a large scale poloidal magnetic field structure , especially during the solar minimum , can be clearly discerned during the solar total eclipse .",
    "field lines of dipole like magnetic field structure are clearly delineated in the intensity patterns of the white light pictures taken during the eclipse .",

    "in fact , in case of the sun , especially for the poloidal magnetic field structure ( @xmath0 1 g ) , this condition is valid .",

    "` p ' modes that penetrate deeply in the radiative core can not sense close to the center .",
    "hence , one has to wait for the discovery of elusive @xmath143 modes that are highly sensitive to the central structure of the sun and hence their characteristics are modified ( rashba 2006 , 2007 , 2008 ; burgess _ et .",

    "although seismology of the sun has provided some of the detailed global aspects of thermal and dynamic structures of the sun s interior , other global structures such as detailed informations regarding meridional flow ( this information is needed to accept or reject so called flux transport dynamo models ) and magnetic field structure are necessary .",
    "hitherto solar seismologists came to the conclusion that the difference between the sun s thermal structure ( especially the sound speed ) and the modeled thermal structure is almost similar .",

    "importantly , as noticed by the previous studies ( chaplin and basu 2008 ; basu and antia 2008 ) , critical examination of modeling and method of computation in estimating the heavy - elemental abundance are necessary .    as for the dynamical helioseismic inferences , especially the rotational structure , ` p ' modes are not the true representatives to sense the deep radiative core . for this purpose",
    "one has to wait for discovery of ` g ' modes that have high sensitivity near the core .",
    "hence knowing of magnitude and form ( _ i.e. , _ dependent or independent of radius and latitude ) of thermal and rotational structures near the core are essential for understanding overall structure and temporal variations of the sun on short ( @xmath0 11 years ) and long ( @xmath0 billion years ) time scales .",
    "although helioseismic inferences of rotation rate of the convective envelope ruled out the increase of rotation rate ( as is assumed to be in the earlier turbulent dynamo models ) from surface to the interior and cylindrical isorotational contours ( simulations by gilman and miller 1981 ) , physics of isorotational contours , especially near the surface , is completely not understood .",
    "however , it should be appreciated that the simulated isorotational contours from base of convection zone to @xmath144 ( kitchatinov and rudiger 1995 ; elliot _ et .",

    "interestingly , toroidal field structure estimated by theoretical ( hiremath 2001 ; brun , miesch and toomre 2004 ) and helioseismic ( antia 2002 ; baldner _ et.al . _",

    "hence , near surface rotational profile is stable .",
    "however , why the sun acquired such a decreasing near surface rotational profile and hence the toroidal magnetic field structure are remained to be explained .",
    "although beyond the scope of this presentation , such a near surface decreasing rotational profile can be explained if one speculates that during the early history of the planetary formation , protoplanetary mass that rotated with keplerian velocity might have accreted on to the sun that resulted in winding of threaded ambient large scale poloidal magnetic field structure into toroidal magnetic field structure .",
