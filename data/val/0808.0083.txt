    "there are qualitatively two different regimes during evolution of nuclear collisions in fermi energy domain . during the initial regime of heavy ion - collisions , namely , from touching until formation of hot and compressed piece of nuclear matter , collisional dissipation and fluctuations are substantially important . on the other hand , during expansion of the system into mechanically unstable spinodal region , collisional effects may be neglected . in the spinodal region ,",
