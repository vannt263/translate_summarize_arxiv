    "one of the carbon allotropes , the spherical fullerene molecule c@xmath0 ( buckminsterfullerene , bucky - ball ) is of particular interest for astrophysics . indeed , in their seminal paper presenting the discovery of c@xmath0 ( kroto et al . , 1985 ) , authors suggested that the molecule might give rise to a super stable species which might exist in interstellar space and circumstellar shells .",
    "a decade later , the first attempt to find c@xmath1 in interstellar medium was made by foing & ehrenfreud ( 1994 ) , who reported on the detection of two interstellar absorptions , at 9577 and 9633  , almost coincident with the wavelengths expected for c@xmath1 .",
    "however , the limited number of observed sight lines , and the fact that the laboratory spectra were acquired in solid state matrices , made that identification uncertain . jenniskens et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and galazutdinov et al .",
    "( 2000 ) pointed out two difficulties inherent to the search for interstellar c@xmath1 ( see the abstract above ) , and mentioned the non - detection of minor c@xmath1 bands , expected at 9429 and 9366   ( telluric lines are particularly strong in this wavelength range ) .",
    "galazutdinov et al .",
    "( 2000 ) also presented the first , simplified attempt to eliminate the influence of stellar mgii line .    in 2010",
    "cami et al . reported on the first detection of infrared emissions carried by neutral c@xmath2 seemingly attached to the solid material ( dust particles ) .",
    "these emissions were observed in the vicinity of a peculiar planetary nebula tc1 .",
    "independently , sellgren et al .",
    "( 2010 ) reported on the presence of neutral c@xmath2 in the ngc 7023 reflection nebula illuminated by a b star hd200775 .",
    "the same nebula was recently identified as a source of c@xmath0 , following the discovery of emission bands at 6.4 , 7.1 , 8.2 , and 10.5 @xmath3 m by bern et al .",
    "the molecule was detected only in the regions closest to the star .",
    "all these reports fostered the hope that the buckminsterfullerene cation would be detected in translucent interstellar clouds .",
    "however , the laboratory spectra of c@xmath0 , available in 1994 , were measured for a solid medium ( cryogenic matrix ) , and these spectra therefore could not offer any firm confirmation of this ion as the one responsible for known 9577 and 9633   diffuse bands .",
    "the dormant interest in discovering interstellar bucky - ball cations was revived following the recent publication of laboratory gas - phase spectra by campbell et al .",
    "according to the authors , c@xmath1 exhibits four relatively strong spectral lines , centered at 9365.9@xmath40.1 , 9428.5@xmath40.1 , 9577.5@xmath40.1 and 9632.7@xmath40.1  , with relative intensities of 0.2 , 0.3 , 1.0 and 0.8 respectively .",
    "new attempts to confirm the presence of this molecule in the interstellar medium , by analysing the spectra of hot , reddened stars , were recently reported by walker et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , who have also tried to detect the two weaker spectral features of c@xmath1 in the sight lines towards hd183143 and hd169454 . very recently ,",
    "campbell , holz & maier ( 2016 ) reported on the detection of a very weak feature at 9348.5    ( just 1/10 of the intensity of the major 9577   band ) , again in a spectrum of hd183143 .",
    "unfortunately , both these studies lack an analysis of possible pollution by telluric lines . indeed , as we demonstrate below , the dib9633 in both hd169454 and hd183143 spectra significantly contaminated by stellar mgii 9632  line .",
    "generally , the hd183143 sight line is not a good choice for finding any new diffuse bands . as demonstrated in the respective dib surveys ( galazutdinov et al .",
    "2000b , hobbs et al .",
    "2009 ) , it is often not easy to distinguish between stellar and interstellar lines towards this relatively cool and slowly rotating white hypergiant classified as b6 to b8 ia-0 ( chentsov 2004 ) .    here",
    "we present the most careful analysis to date of near - infrared interstellar features commonly attributed to c@xmath1 , for a relatively large sample of targets .",
    "we took into account the possibilities of spectral contamination not only from telluric but also from stellar lines . indeed , incidental overlap with stellar lines is at particularly important danger in cases such as hd183143 , where broad interstellar features have widths comparable to the stellar lines , the latter being numerous in this late b type supergiant .",
    "our sample of astronomical data includes precise measurements of the 9577   and 9633   bands , the two major interstellar features allegedly resulting from c@xmath1 .",
    "high signal - to - noise and high resolution echell spectra were obtained for 19 heavily reddened targets ( tables 1 and 2 ) with the uves spectrograph fed by the kueyen 8-m telescope at paranal .",
    "the resolving power r=@xmath5/@xmath6 was 80,000 in the range of mgii 4481.2   line , and 110,000 in the range of currently analysed diffuse interstellar bands ( dib ) .",
    "all spectra were processed and measured in a standard way using both iraf ( tody 1986 ) and our own dech codes .",
    "the wavelength scale of all spectra was corrected by well - known atomic / molecular interstellar lines , e.g. ki and c@xmath7 .",
    "+ @xmath8 - see the comment in `` mgii contamination '' section .",
    "+ @xmath8 - the corrected equivalent width of dib9633 measured towards hd63804 is an upper limit , owing to uncertain basic stellar parameters .",
    "[ c60data : continued ]      near infrared wavelength range , when observed using ground  based instruments , is subject to strong contamination by telluric lines . in order to eliminate them , we applied the classical method implemented based on the use of a divisor , namely the spectrum of an unreddened , hot , and preferably rapidly rotating , star .",
    "our software allowed for the compensation of both positional and intensity variability within the set of observed telluric lines . as a divisor we used the uves spectra of spica ( hd116658 ) .",
    "recently , tkachenko et al . (",
    "2016 ) published an extensive study of this close binary system , which has an orbital period of @xmath94@xmath10 , effective temperatures of 25,300@xmath4500 k and 20,900@xmath4500 k , logarithms of gravity 3.71@xmath40.10 and 4.15@xmath40.15 , rotational velocities @xmath11 165.3@xmath44.5 km / s and 58.8@xmath41.5 km / s , for the primary and secondary components respectively .",
    "when used for the removal of telluric lines , the complex and variable spectrum of spica may introduce unwanted distortion into relatively broad profiles , such as that of dib9633 , owing to the presence of stellar line(s ) .",
    "this is depicted in figure [ molcfit]a for the dib9633 profile observed towards hd183143 .",
    "the lack of a stellar , contaminating component inside the dib9633 profile , is evident .",
    "however , in order to check for the applicability of spica s spectra as divisors , we tested the recently introduced molecfit procedure ( smette et al . , 2015 ) , a software tool designed to remove atmospheric absorption features .",
    "[ molcfit]b shows a good matching of the dib9633 profiles derived with the divisor ( spica ) and molecfit approaches .",
    "the same quality of agreement has also been found for the other three bands that are candidates for c@xmath0 absorptions .",
    "we checked the removal of telluric lines for all targets using both methods .",
    "background stars are obviously not ideal sources of radiation for measuring interstellar absorptions , particularly because of the presence of their own spectral features .",
    "the pollution of the dib9633 profile by the stellar mgii line , even though it has been discussed in the past , has never been properly taken into account .",
    "estimations of mgii 9632   line strengths are complicated by the sensitivity to non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( non - lte ) effects present in atmospheres of hot stars .",
    "the variability of this atomic feature with changing stellar parameters ( for solar chemical composition only ) is shown in fig .",
    ". however , we caution against a simplified conclusion that the removal of the mgii 9632    line is always compulsory . for the majority of hot objects",
    "the line is in fact weak , shallow , and much broader than dib9633 , owing to the rapid rotation and/or high gravity ( e.g. hd145502 , see table 1 ) , so that it may not noticeably alter the coinciding dib profile ( see fig [ shallowmg2 ] ) .",
    "there are particular `` lucky '' instances where the blend of dib9633 and mgii can be easily resolved .",
    "this may occur when the difference between the radial velocity of a background star and the velocity of the studied interstellar cloud is large or when the dib is intrinsically shifted in relation to its `` normal '' positions .",
    "hd37022 offers the example of this latter possibility ( fig .",
    "[ mg2intwostars ] ) with the red  shift of dib9633 discovered by kreowski & greenberg ( 1999 ) and recently confirmed by kreowski et al .",
    "on the other hand , even an evidently strong stellar line may hide completely inside the dib profile when the radial velocities of a star and the cloud are similar ( fig . [ mg2intwostars ] ) .",
    "the stellar line of ionized magnesium can thus in many cases severely contaminate the dib9633 profile . in order to eliminate this effect",
    ", we first corrected the oscillator strength ( gf ) of the mgii 9632.1    transition , using a high quality uves spectrum of sirius , where both neutral and ionized magnesium lines are easily seen .",
    "the magnesium abundance was estimated based on the well - known lines at 4703.0 , 5183.6 , 5528.4    ( mgi ) and 4481.2   ( mgii ) measured in the spectrum of sirius .",
    "then , the oscillator strength of the 9632    mgii line ( table 3 ) was corrected by matching the observed profile with the model spectrum ( fig.[sirius ] ) .",
    "the basic stellar parameters of the program stars ( effective temperature , logarithm of gravity , rotational velocity , chemical composition ) were determined with the aid of star code ( menzhevitski et al . , 2014 ) which takes account of non - lte effects for hi , hei , heii , cii , ciii and mgii species .",
    "hydrostatic models of stellar atmospheres were calculated using the program atlas12 ( castelli & kurucz , 2004 ) , and the non - lte populations for the above mentioned elements were derived using the software package nonlte3 ( sakhibullin , 1983 ) .",
    "the magnitude of non - lte effects and chemical composition of the investigated stars were derived by the analysis of certain atomic lines located in wavelength ranges free of telluric contamination and having well - determined parameters , for example : h@xmath12-h@xmath13 , hei 4009.2 , 4026.2 , 4387.9 , 4471.5 , 4713.2 , 4921.9 , 5047.8  , heii 4199.8 , 4541.6  , cii 3918.9 , 3920.8 , 4266.9  , ciii 4651.5 , 4665.9  , mgii 4481.2 .",
    "the basic parameters of the observed stars and the derived abundance of several chemical elements are listed in table 1 .",
    "it is confirmed that subtraction of the stellar 9632    mgii line may essentially reduce the intensity of the interstellar feature at 9633     ( fig .",
    "[ hd80077 ] ) .",
    "conversely , dib9577 is not polluted by stellar lines , for all the sight lines investigated here .",
    "our results for the four dibs previously assigned to c@xmath1 are collected in table 2 .",
    "note that equivalent widths of dib9633 are given in two separate columns which list the values without and with the correction for the stellar mgii line .",
    "below we provide information specific to each of the studied targets .",
    "the abundance of alpha elements is [ x / h ] = -0.4 dex .",
    "moderate deficits of helium , magnesium and nitrogen are revealed , while silicon exhibits an overabundance .",
    "a strong blend of mgii 4481   and aliii 4479   lines generated in the model spectrum matches the observed profile well .",
    "subtracting the 9632   line of mgii reduces the intensity of dib9633 almost half .",
    "minor bands at 9429 and 9366  , expected for c@xmath1 are below the level of detection .",
    "overabundances of he , n , si ( up to + 0.3 dex ) are typical for stars experiencing the cno - cycle .",
    "the magnesium abundance [ mg / h ] = 0.1 dex is accurately estimated by means of the mgii 4481  line .",
    "this object provides an example of the diffuse band at 9633   being stronger than that at 9577  , despite that the intensity of former being reduced by the removal of the contribution from stellar magnesium .",
    "there is a good coincidence of the observed phase of this binary target with the model spectrum .",
    "the magnitude of non - lte effects is low .",
    "the chemical composition exhibits a small deficit of heavy elements .",
    "the binarity of the target is well seen in the observed spectrum but can be reproduced . the doubled profile of mgii 4481   line is satisfactorily coincident with the model spectrum .",
    "a weak mgii line at 9632   fades with strong hei line to a smeared blend .",
    "there is good coincidence of observed and model spectra .",
    "the magnitude of non - lte effects is low .",

    "the symmetric profile of 4481   mgii line is very well reproduced in the synthetic spectrum .",
    "the 9632   line of mgii makes a major contribution to a blend with dib9633 .",
    "the basic stellar parameters of this object can be reliably determined based on hi balmer lines and on the spectral features of hei , fei , feii , cii , siii . however , the observed mgii 4481    line is too strong , considering any realistic abundance of magnesium .",
    "weaker mgi and mgii lines point to [ mg / h]=-0.3 dex .",
    "the star is probably a spectroscopic binary , with components having the effective temperature of @xmath98000 and @xmath914000 k. the cooler object is brighter , with its spectral lines red - shifted by @xmath940 - 50 km / s .",
    "additional spectra , acquired 1 - 2 years later , will permit for a more complete description .",
    "nevertheless , a strong mgii 9632  line leaves little space for the interstellar 9633    feature .",
    "the latter has just 1/10 of the dib9577 intensity , which is eight times weaker than expected assuming c@xmath1 as the carrier .",

    "the presence or absence of weaker c@xmath1 bands , at 9429   and 9366  ,  is doubtful owing to saturated telluric lines that significantly pollute that part of the spectrum .",
    "excesses of + 0.4 dex are found here for the alpha elements and helium .",
    "nitrogen and silicon are overabundant by + 0.5 dex .",

    "the presence / absence of 9429   and 9366   features is uncertain , owing to saturated telluric lines .",

    "the synthetic profile of a blend made by mgii 4481   and aliii 4479    matches the observed spectrum well .",
    "this sight line exemplifies the case of unusually strong 9633   band ; even after the subtraction of the stellar mgii feature , the equivalent width is still higher than for dib9577 , in strong disagreement with the ratio of respective bands observed in the laboratory gas phase spectrum of c@xmath0 .",

    "2016 ) . as noted",
    ", this identification of interstellar c@xmath0 was premature , as it laked the analysis of the stellar spectrum . indeed ,",

    "there is an excellent coincidence of observed and model spectra .",
    "non - lte effects are moderate , without any detectable stellar wind effects .",
    "the estimated rotational velocity is as high as 220 km / s .",
    "the chemical composition exhibits an excessive abundance of helium and nitrogen , probably owing to the enrichment of stellar surface by cno - cycle products .",
    "the profile of the mgii 4481  line is symmetric , which is well reproduced by the model .",
    "there is no mgii line overlapping dib9633 .",
    "the laboratory gas - phase absorption spectrum of c@xmath0 features four main infrared bands : 9632.7 , 9577.5 , 9428.5 and 9365.9   ( @xmath4 0.1  ) , with relative intensities of 0.8 , 1.0 , 0.3 , and 0.2 , respectively ; thus the strongest peak is at 9577.5    ( campbell et al . , 2015 ) .",
    "no lines of sight in our sample allowed the detection of that spectral pattern .",
    "in particular , no candidates for the two weakest of the above listed bands have emerged ( cf . the second part of table 2 ) .",
    "apart from that , the assignment of diffuse bands at 9633    and 9577    to the two strongest c@xmath0 bands suffers from the fact that the observed intensity ratio dib9633/dib9577 varies greatly from target to target instead of scattering , within the known error limits , around a `` canonical '' value of 0.8 ( see tab .",
    "2 ) . towards the majority of our targets ,",

    "on the other hand , lines of sight with extremely low dib9633 intensities were revealed ( tab .",
    "2 ) . such large variations of the observed strength ratio cast serious doubts on whether the two bands could indeed share a common carrier .    a convincing illustration of these issues is provided by the results acquired for hd145502 , an object free from the mgii effect and intentionally selected to waive all speculation concerning the accuracy of our stellar line removal procedure . moreover , the elimination of telluric lines was particularly successful for hd145502 ( fig .",
    "[ hd145502 - 4dibs ] ) . for that sight line ,",
    "dib9633 is exceptionally strong , in fact much stronger than dib9577 , making the dib9633/dib9577 ratio as big as 1.3 , instead of the 0.8 observed in laboratory gas - phase spectra .",
    "both features are blue - shifted and broader than expected , when compared with the known c@xmath0 bands . concerning the two remaining , minor bands of c@xmath0 , it is the case that the relevant wavelength range is very difficult to study because of exceptionally strong telluric lines , which are difficult to remove because of saturation effects . nevertheless , the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ hd145502 - 4dibs ] clearly demonstrates that there is no room for broad and shallow features of the expected depth .",
    "the gaussians , normalized to the depth of dib9577 , intersect the observed spectrum making thus the presence of both weak features very unlikely .",
    "the second example illustrates the opposite case , with a very small dib9633/dib9577 ratio .",
    "indeed , in the spectrum of hd183143 , after the mgii correction , the intensity of dib9633 was reduced by a factor of more than 2 . the presence or absence of weak dib9366",
    "can not be confirmed owing to very strong telluric lines which seem to be partially blended .",
    "the profile of another weak band , dib9428 , intersects the observed spectrum in which it can hardly be traced .",
    "another interesting object is hd37022 . as depicted by fig . 4",
    ", dib9633 is red - shifted in this spectrum , similar to what was reported for dib5780 ( kreowski et al .",

    "importantly , however , the other crucial c@xmath0 candidate band , dib9577 , which is very broad in this spectrum , does _ not _ show any red  shift ( and may even be slightly blue  shifted ) .",
    "this is further evidence against a common origin of the two major dibs attributed to c@xmath0 .    , with wavelengths , widths , and intensity ratios ( normalized to the depth of dib9577 ) taken from the campbell et al .",

    "is the fact that the corrected wavelengths derived for the 2 major peaks of bare c@xmath0 ( 9577.0 and 9632.1  , with @xmath40.2   as the 2@xmath17 uncertainty ) are in good agreement with the * mean * values calculated for our present sample of targets : 9577.0 and 9632.2  .",
    "however , the observed scatter of position of peaks in astronomical spectra greatly exceeds the uncertainty of measurements .",
    "diffuse bands of the common origin have to be displaced in unison , keeping the same distance between them ; in other words , the scatter of positions of diffuse bands in astronomical measurements ( table 2 ) can not be explained by an assumption of their common origin .",
    "indeed , as we already reported , dib9633 and stellar mgii line at 9632   can be easily distinguished in the spectrum of hd37022 ( fig . [ mg2intwostars ] ) where dib9633 exhibits an evident red - shift , while the second major band 9577 fits the `` new '' lab wavelength well ( fig .",

    "our observations of hd183143 ( our table 2 ) confirm the wavelength of interstellar feature at 9577  .",

    "weak interactions between c@xmath0 cations and some common constituents of the interstellar gas remain to be modelled and/or measured in laboratories . at present",
    "it s anybody s guess that such complexes , if bound strong enough to withstand the temperatures of the translucent interstellar medium , would have spectra differing from that of bare c@xmath0 by much more than the documented scatter of dib9633 and dib9577 wavelengths / intensities .",
    "it should also be noticed that complexes with helium , experimentally observed by campbell et al .",
    ", formed with a high number density of he atoms ( 10@xmath18 @xmath19 ) and that temperatures below 8 k were required .",
    "such species have therefore not been postulated to be of any significance for the dib phenomenon .",
    "it seems that the only astronomically observed parameters that match the laboratory ones relatively well are fwhms of diffuse bands .",
    "they are slightly broader than the laboratory ones for 9577 band , but in general the similarity is satisfactory in most of the observed lines of sight ( table 2 ) .",
    "the results from the observed sample of 19 reddened stars having spectra with easily detectable diffuse bands at 9577 and 9633    do not allow us to assign these features to near - ir transitions of c@xmath1 , and thus to confirm the presence of this cation in translucent interstellar clouds , for the following reasons :    * the ratio of dib9633 and dib9577 equivalent widths is variable within a broad range : see table 2 and , for example , figs .",
    "[ hd145502 - 4dibs ] , [ hd183143 - 4dibs ] , [ hd170740 ] .",
    "the resultant mutual correlation is very poor , much worse than within any other pair of reasonably strong dibs ( fig .",
    "[ dibs9633vs9577 ] ) . *",
    "we have not confirmed the presence of two weaker members of the c@xmath0 family , expected at 9428 and 9366   the former is stronger in laboratory but more difficult to be traced in observations , even though these should appear assuming the validity of experimentally determined intensity ratios . *",
    "the `` interstellar '' wavelengths of the two strongest dibs proposed for c@xmath0 show evident variability , but not in unison , i.e. the distance between dib9633 and dib9577 discernibly fluctuates .",
    "* the profile shapes of both diffuse bands are variable .",
    "in particular , asymmetric profiles were found in several cases , contrasting with what was reported for gas - phase c@xmath0 .    , is 0.8 !",
    "note that that the originaly observed intensity ratio , before the subtraction of a stellar mgii contribution , was even greater , as big as 1.9.,width=4 ]        in general , the observed very poor correlation of the two discussed dibs can be explained , together with the variable shapes of dib profiles , by some blending with other , as yet unresolved diffuse bands .",
    "nevertheless , both the lack of a firm detection of the two minor bands expected for c@xmath0 and , for the major candidate bands , the disagreement of central wavelengths with laboratory values need to be addressed in order to defend the recently claimed identification of c@xmath0 .",
    "cami et al . ( 2010 ) suggested that `` the absence of the corresponding spectral features of fullerene cations and anions implies that the fullerenes are in the neutral state '' .",
    "this remark , formulated in the context of _ circumstellar _ matter , may prove correct for translucent interstellar clouds also .",

    "<S> the laboratory gas phase spectrum recently published by campbell et al . has reinvigorated attempts to confirm the presence of the c@xmath0 cation in the interstellar medium , thorough an analysis of the spectra of hot , reddened stars . </S>",
    "<S> this search is hindered by at least two issues that need to be addressed : ( i ) the wavelength range of interest is severely polluted by strong water- vapour lines coming from the earth s atmosphere ; ( ii ) one of the major bands attributed to c@xmath0 , at 9633  , is blended with the stellar mgii line , which is susceptible to non - local - thermodynamic equilibrium effects in hot stellar atmospheres . </S>",
    "<S> both these issues are here carefully considered here for the first time , based on high - resolution and high signal - to - noise ratio echell spectra for 19 lines of sight . </S>",
