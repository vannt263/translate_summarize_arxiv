    "finally , there is a  hard component \" ( resolved or anomalous qcd component ) which requires knowledge of the quark and gluon parton density functions of the photon .",
    "the direct and hard contributions to two - photon interactions can be measured in open heavy flavour production . in this case",
    "a hard physical scale is given by the c- or b - quark mass . at lep energies , the direct and single resolved processes , shown in figure  [ fig : feynman ] , are predicted to give comparable contributions to the charm production cross section @xcite , whereas at low energies the direct process dominates .",
