    "the non  detection of high  ionization state emission lines typically observed in agn spectra , e.g.   @xmath23 , @xmath24 , or @xmath25 , strongly suggests that the  emission in es1 is due to the lyman continuum flux of ob stars , rather than the hard uv spectrum of an agn . for @xmath26 , the nebular emission lines typically associated with star  forming galaxies are inaccessible to optical spectroscopy .    we were fortunate that es1 is located in the hdf north west flanking field .",

    "this is challengingly faint , comparable to the first detected galaxies at @xmath29 , e.g.  hdf 3951 with @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "moreover , as an appreciable fraction of the @xmath31band radiation for the source is from the  emission line , the true continuum magnitude must be still fainter than that determined from the source extraction .",
    "es1 appears marginally resolved , subtending 03 ( fwhm ) on the flanking field image , while stars on the same image have a fwhm near 02 .",
    "thus , the physical size of the emitting region appears to be only @xmath32 kpc in diameter .",
    "we present ground  based @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath31 , and @xmath35 images of es1 in figure  [ 4band ] and we give the ground  based photometry in table  [ phot ] .",
    "the @xmath33 and @xmath31 images are from the canada france hawaii telescope imaging campaign of @xcite ; the @xmath34 and @xmath35 images are from our own keck imaging campaign of the hdf and its environs ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the fact that es1 is not detectable in the @xmath33 or @xmath34 bands is characteristic of high  redshift galaxies , where intervening neutral hydrogen ( the lyman forests ) severely attenuates the continuum signal blueward of  @xcite .",
    "the fact that es1 is not detectable in the @xmath35 band is due only to the comparative shallowness of the @xmath35 band image .",
    "based on the model spectrum described in section   [ models ] and assuming that es1 has a flat spectrum in @xmath36 at wavelengths longer than the emission line , we expect a vega  based continuum magnitude in the @xmath35 band of @xmath37 .",
    "this value is almost five times as faint as the @xmath38 limiting magnitude in that image ( see table  [ phot ] ) .",
    "in the fashionable cosmology @xmath39 , @xmath17 , the es1  flux of @xmath4 ergs @xmath5 s@xmath6 corresponds to a line luminosity of @xmath40 ergs s@xmath6 . for the prescription given in @xcite assuming no dust aborption and negligible extinction , this luminosity corresponds to a star formation rate ( sfr ) of @xmath41 m@xmath42 yr@xmath6 . as is evident in figure  [ lums ] , these values are typical of emitting galaxies at high redshift ( @xmath11 ) discovered serendipitously ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or in narrow band surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "of course , such galaxies may represent rare systems at the high  luminosity tip of an unexplored underlying population , and the observed  luminosities may accordingly be governed by a selection effect .",
    "this point is borne out by the faint system discovered in the blind spectroscopic survey of well  constrained lensing clusters @xcite , which is at a higher redshift ( @xmath43 ) and is an order of magnitude less luminous in  than es1 .",
    "we estimate a rest  frame equivalent width for the emission line of @xmath44   based on the emission line model described in the following section .",
    "this result should be treated with a degree of circumspection , however .",
    "the foremost caveat is that both the total line flux and the continuum level which enter the calculation were obtained from the model spectrum before attenuation by neutral hydrogen absorption . in this manner we attempted to circumvent the ambiguity in deriving an equivalent width from a strongly p  cygni line profile coupled with a pronounced continuum break , essentially arriving at a theoretical equivalent width from the spectrum as it would appear if not truncated by foreground absorption . as a second caveat ,",
    "the continuum redward of the emission line is not well  detected , with a significance of far less than @xmath45 .",
    "together , we expect these two effects to cause an over - estimation of .",
    "however , this tendency toward over  estimation may be offset by the fact that this is a serendipitous detection , so es1 was not well centered in the spectroscopic slit ( see figure  [ hdfff ] ) .",
    "as such , we have been conservative in our estimate of the uncertainty in , which includes sky noise , the uncertainty in the continuum level redward of the emission line in the extracted spectrum , and the fit errors in the model spectrum .",
    "even so , with @xmath44  , es1 figures in the top 2% of lyman  break galaxies with  in emission in the near  complete continuum  selected sample of @xcite .",
    "the asymmetric  emission lines commonly observed in high  redshift starburst galaxies are generally ascribed to the interaction of lyman continuum photons generated by newborn ob associations with a galaxy  scale expanding shell of neutral hydrogen . for a sufficiently massive starburst , the hot ionized gas created in the vicinity of the stars vents into the halo of the galaxy , where it sweeps up neutral hydrogen into an optically thick shell .",
    "recombination in the ionized gas converts lyman continuum photons escaping from the surface of the hot stars into line photons .",
    "then , from the vantage of an observer , the near side of the expanding shell absorbs photons on the blue side of the resonant  emission line , causing a flux decrement on what would otherwise be the blue wing of the  emission .",
    "the far side of the shell back ",
    "scatters  photons into the observer s line  of  sight ; as these photons are offset redward by hundreds of km s@xmath6 from both the rest frame of the galaxy and the approaching side of the neutral shell , they escape the galaxy and impose a pronounced red wing on the emission line profile .",
    "the net effect is to create the p ",
    "cygni profile ubiquitous in observations of expanding shells .",
    "the comparatively high signal  to  noise of the es1  detection created the opportunity for probing this emission line structure with a simple model . in accordance with the scenario described above",
    ", we fit the  emission feature with three components : ( 1 ) a comparatively large amplitude , narrow gaussian intended to model line radiation generated by recombination in the ionized hydrogen ; ( 2 ) a small amplitude , broad gaussian intended to model the red wing of line photons back  scattered off the far side of the expanding shell ; and ( 3 ) a voigt absorption profile intended to model the blue decrement caused by the absorption of line photons by the near side of the shell .",
    "we modeled the weak continuum with a constant ( @xmath46 ) baseline .    to account for the continuum decrement caused by line blanketing in the  forest , we attenuated the model spectrum by a transmission profile adopted from @xcite , where the optical depth due to the combined effect of many  absorption lines is given as @xmath47 with @xmath48  . at high redshifts ( @xmath49 ) ,",
    "absorption by metal systems makes a non  negligible contribution to cosmic opacity .",
    "hence , we accounted for the combined effect of metal lines with the additional factor also given in @xcite , @xmath50 neither lyman series line blanketing nor continuum absorption from neutral hydrogen were included , as both these effects fall shortward of the wavelength range of interest .",
    "figure  [ modspec ] shows the minimum@xmath51 model resulting when the centroids , amplitudes , and widths of each of the model components are left unconstrained .",
    "we weighted the @xmath51fit by the error spectrum shown in the figure ; this had the effect of diminishing the contribution to the fit by pixels which fall on oh and o@xmath52 night sky emission lines ( which are the dominant source of error in low signal  to  noise spectra over the wavelengths of interest ) .",
    "we note that the residuals are distributed evenly about zero , demonstrating an encouraging lack of systematic error in our model .",
    "furthermore , when just the components intended to model the expanding shell were examined ( the red , broad gaussian and the blue voigt  profile absorption ) , we found the resulting profile to be in excellent qualitative agreement with the p ",
    "cygni line profiles expected for the transfer of line photons in expanding envelopes ( e.g.  see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "table  [ fittab ] summarizes the minimum@xmath51 model parameters .",
    "this best ",
    "fit model yields a redshift for the central component of the es1 emission line of @xmath53 .",
    "most strikingly , to fit the red wing of the emission line , the model demands that the broad emission component be displaced by 320 km s@xmath6 from the central emission component . owing to the strong signal of the  forest at such a high redshift",
    ", only a small blue absorption component is required .",
    "still , though of minor amplitude , the absorption component is displaced by fully @xmath54 km s@xmath6 from the central emission component .",
    "these displacement velocities are in broad agreement with those predicted by @xcite for the late stages of the evolution of the profile of a star  forming galaxy . moreover , though these values somewhat exceed the @xmath55 km s@xmath6 winds typically observed in nearby starbursting dwarf galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they compare favorably with the @xmath9  @xmath10 km s@xmath6 outflows observed in more powerful local starbursts @xcite .",
    "we explored a variety of alternative kinematic scenarios for the es1 emission , most notably by fixing the centroid for the central emission component and arbitrarily sliding the separation between the central component and the broad component over a range of values .",
    "these models suffered from worsened @xmath51 , with broader emission demanded as the displacement velocity was diminished .",
    "figure  [ mvred ] illustrates this trend , implying that even if the minimum@xmath51 model in figure  [ modspec ] over  estimates the separation between the central component and the broad component of the  emission , the broad component itself can only get broader .",
    "that is , no matter what combination of fit ",
    "parameters one chooses , there is no escaping a very energetic component to the  emission of es1 . in a similar vein , it is also worthy of note that models which do not include a high  velocity compenent ( e.g.  models with a single gaussian emission compenent ) also suffer from a worsened @xmath51 compared to that of the model in figure  [ modspec ] .",
    "the spectral profile of the  emission of es1 presents evidence for a galaxy  scale outflow with a velocity of @xmath8 km s@xmath6 . of course , as @xcite caution , the outflow rate of a galactic wind can not necessarily be interpreted as the rate at which mass or energy _ escapes _ into the igm , since the observable manifestation of an outflow may be produced by material still deep inside the gravitational potential well of the galaxy halo .",
    "nonetheless , the outflow velocity estimated for es1 far exceeds the escape speed of a nominally low mass ( @xmath56 ) pregalactic fragment , consistent with the general observation that hot gas can readily escape from dwarf galaxies , though perhaps not from more massive systems @xcite .",
    "this conclusion bears on a host of cosmological issues surrounding the evolution of galaxies and the igm at high redshift .",
    "foremost , it suggests that processed material from es1 will become available to the igm , potentially providing the enrichment necessary to account for the amount of metals there observed .",
    "indeed , recent observations of absorption systems along the lines  of  sight to lensed qsos call for enrichment at increasingly high redshift , beyond even @xmath29 ( e.g.aguirre et al .  2001 ; rauch , sargent , & barlow 2001 ) .",
    "additionally , both detailed observations and careful theoretical studies demand a mechanism for pre  heating the material out of which galaxy clusters ultimately collapse and become bound ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . here again ,",
    "galaxy  scale outflows at high redshift are the likely culprit ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "finally , galactic winds have proved important in reproducing the faint ",
    "end slope of the observed field galaxy luminosity function in semi  analytic models of galaxy formation .",
    "outflows are invoked to suppress star ",
    "formation in low ",
    "mass dark matter halos , either via the direct escape of gas  phase baryons in the outflow itself ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or by ram pressure stripping of the gas  phase baryons by energetic winds from neighboring galaxies @xcite .    as a somewhat speculative conclusion , we now consider the expected correlation between strong galactic outflows and the escape of lyman continuum radiation from star  forming galaxies .",
    "this correlation bears directly on the much  debated physical nature and relative contributions of the sources which comprise the uv background , as a significant contribution by sources other than qsos is required at high redshift , owing to the rapid decline in the space density of optical and radio  loud quasars at @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "it is likely that star ",
    "forming galaxies fill this niche . from the theoretical standpoint , mechanical energy deposition in the form of supernovae and stellar winds",
    "is expected to result in an over  pressured cavity of hot gas inside star  forming galaxies . in galaxies",
    "for which the star  formation rate per unit area @xmath57 , the superbubble ultimately expands and bursts out into the galaxy halo , allowing for the escape of hot gas and facilitating the leak of lyman continuum photons @xcite .",
    "of course , as the superbubble will expand in the direction of the vertical pressure gradient , the burst is expected to take the form of a weakly collimated , bipolar wind .",
    "hence , the leak of uv radiation may depend sensitively on not only the distribution of neutral gas and dust in the galaxy interstellar medium , but on the inclination of the system .",
    "nonetheless , from the observational standpoint , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter spa01 ) report the detection of significant lyman continuum emission in a composite spectrum of 29 lyman  break galaxies at @xmath58 , suggesting an escape fraction of uv ionizing photons of @xmath59 .",
    "given the evidence for a strong outflow in es1 , it would be intriguing to measure the flux of photons below @xmath60  .",
    "however , es1 is very faint even above ; we estimate that it fades to @xmath61 below the lyman limit .",
    "we can do only slightly better at high redshifts with more accessible spectra : even in a composite of four of the highest signal  to  noise keck spectra of galaxies at @xmath49 collected by spinrad and collaborators ( figure  [ composite ] ) , our measurement of the flux of 900   photons is consistent with zero at the @xmath45 level .",
    "this result translates to the coarsely constrained flux ratio @xmath62 ( @xmath45 uncertainty ) . to convert this value to the more useful @xmath63 ratio",
    ", we adopt an empirical correction factor based on the set of fluxes given in spa01 , yielding an effective @xmath64 .",
    "finally , for the same intrinsic lyman discontinuity of 3 adopted by spa1 , we find an escape fraction of @xmath65 .",
    "as we did not correct our initial @xmath66 ratio for the opacity of the igm , this value represents a lower limit . evidently , to satisfactorily constrain the correlation between outflow dynamics and the escape of uv ionizing photons in an individual high redshift galaxy",
    ", we will require spectroscopy of a lensed , blue candidate system viewed along the outflow direction .",
