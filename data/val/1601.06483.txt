    "the quantum walk ( qw ) has been widely employed as a useful tool to design quantum algorithms , quantum gates and quantum computation  @xcite . due to the demand of searching from a large database , multi - dimensional quantum fast search algorithms based on quantum walks",
    "have drawn lots of attention  @xcite .",
    "in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) discrete time quantum walk ( dtqw ) , by introducing the four - level grover coin into the evolution , the quantum grover search algorithm has been realized in the 2d position space  @xcite . the quantum search in the higher - dimensional hypercube has also been discussed  @xcite . when considering the real experimental implementation , the physical system will have an inevitable interaction with the surrounding environment .",
    "many studies of dtqw report that due to the decoherence induced by the environment , the position distribution pattern of qw change to a binomial distribution that is similar to the distribution of the classical walk  @xcite . for the coherent qw , the variance of position distribution in the qw grows quadratically with time . while with the introduction of decoherence into the walk , the variance of the position will grows linearly with time , which is the characteristics of the classical walk . in some sense , the emergence of decoherence in the qw makes the original qw convert to a classical walk .    recently , a 2d quantum walk with one two - level coin is presented  @xcite . in this alternative quantum walk ( aqw ) , the two - level coin affects the walker moving in the @xmath0-direction at first , followed by the motion of walker along the @xmath1-direction .",
    "the position distribution pattern induced by the 2d dtqw with four - level grover coin can be recovered with the aqw with only one two - level coin  @xcite . due to the function of the coin as the register of the coherence and randomness in the aforementioned dtqw , when the searching space increases to @xmath2-dimension , we need a @xmath3-level coin to implement the search process .",
    "such indispensable resource makes the quantum grover search in high dimensions hardly realize in experiment .",
    "thanks to the reduction of resource of aqw , this aqw is more feasible than the original 2d dtqw with a four - level coin in experimental realizations  @xcite .",
    "the generalization of aqw to higher - dimensional position space has already been achieved  @xcite .",
    "the effect of environment on the aqw needs to be counted in the applications of real - life quantum information .",
    "the decoherence including random phases , bit - flip noise , and phase flip noise in the coin space have already been discussed in the 2d aqw  @xcite .",
    "the numerical results reveal that the classical behaviors will emerge in the 2d aqw with increasing the strength of the decoherence .    in this paper",
    ", we study the quantum and classical behaviors of the 2d aqw when the coin and the walker undergo any kinds of decoherence . by employing the method presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , we provide the analytic expressions for the first and second moments of position in the presence of any kinds of decoherence .",
    "we take the broken line noise model as an example of the coin - position decoherence of the aqw at first , then we consider a 2d aqw involving coin - decoherence that the coin is measured at each step with a certain probability . in our discussion , we assume that the decoherence emerges in the motion along the @xmath0-direction of 2d aqw .",
    "we study the position distribution of the 2d aqw , and the variance of the position distribution with the change of the strength of the decoherence . in our work",
    ", we find that , for different kinds of decoherence , the different quantum and classical behaviors in the 2d aqw emerge , and not both the motions along @xmath0 and @xmath1-directions of the aqw exhibit the transition from the quantum behaviors to classical behaviors .",

    "what s more , we study the classical and quantum correlations between the @xmath0 and @xmath1-directional walkers involving the coin - position decoherence and coin - decoherence . the anisotropic patterns for the correlations between quantum walkers and the coin have been found .",

    ", the role of the system is represented by the walkers and coin of 2d aqw , the evolution of the system is affected by the noise from the surrounding environment .",
