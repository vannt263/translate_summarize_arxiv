    "planar quantum electrodynamics ( qed3 ) has been of great theoretical interest for many years .",
    "the restriction to lower dimensionality profoundly changes the structure of the electromagnetic field and its symmetries @xcite . in two spatial dimensions ( 2 + 1d ) the electromagnetic potential between point charges that scales as @xmath0 instead of @xmath1 , leading one to expect charge confinement in the appropriate limit .",
    "qed3 with massive fermions is particularly rich .",
    "one of the two possible lorentz invariant mass terms breaks parity and time reversal symmetry , leading to a topological chern - simons term in the photon action .",
    "this term produces a gap in the photon spectrum and makes the effective interaction between the fermions short ranged .",
    "the other lorentz invariant fermion mass term breaks  chiral \" symmetry and is spontaneously generated at low temperatues .",
    "both confinement and chiral symmetry breaking occur in quantum chromodynamics ; since qed3 is a much simpler theory it has been studied as a model system for these effects @xcite .",
    "further , qed3 has been proposed as an effective theory for spin - liquids @xcite and the pseudogap phase of high - temperature superconductors @xcite .",
    "a direct experimental realization of qed3 could therefore be relevant to many areas of both condensed matter and high energy physics .",
    "recent advances in cold atom physics and optical lattices @xcite have made the simulation of qed3 a real experimental possibility .",
    "dirac fermions appear at half filling in a hexagonal optical lattice @xcite , mimicking the relativistic band structure of graphene @xcite .",
    "they also appear in a square lattice with appropriate complex hopping matrix elements @xcite .",
    "this has led to a number of proposals to emulate relativistic physics with cold atoms @xcite . here",
    "we extend these previous proposals by showing how to emulate qed3 with cold atoms . by combining mixtures of bosons and fermions on interpenetrating optical lattices with appropriately tuned densities and interactions , both relativistic fermions and the full 3-component dynamical gauge field",
    "can be constructed , allowing qed3 to be probed directly .",
    "the linear bogoliubov excitations of three species of bosonic atoms correspond to the three components of the vector field @xmath2 .",
    "one of the boson species occupies the same lattice as the fermions , while the other two sit on alternating bonds between the fermion sites .",
    "these bosons modulate the fermion hopping amplitudes , leading to an interaction that at low energy has the form of a gauge coupling @xmath3 . being a lattice model ,",
    "higher energy terms in this theory will naturally deviate from the emergent lorentz and gauge invariances , but at low energies , these terms are heavily suppressed , and after applying the wilsonian prescription of discarding irrelevant operators , the resulting hamiltonian is that of qed3 .",
    "it is important to note that in the real time formalism , the time ( @xmath4 ) component of the gauge field is canonically quantized by operators with negative norm , with causality and hermiticity preserved in real states by the ward identity @xcite .",
    "this is a general feature of vector bosons , and can not be duplicated with cold atoms .",
    "however , in the finite temperature ( imaginary time ) formalism , all the components of the @xmath5 field have positive norm .",
    "thus , we focus on producing a quantum simulator which reproduces the thermodynamics of qed3 . many of the most interesting properties of qed3 ( such as mass generation and symmetry breaking ) can be probed through equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "further , some real - time correlations can be accessed through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "our construction is very different from traditional examples of gauge fields in condensed matter systems @xcite .",
    "typically , these gauge theories arise from using descriptions with redundant degrees of freedom ( such as slave bosons in the large @xmath6 fermi hubbard model ) .",
    "the complicated underlying physics of these emergent gauge theories makes it difficult to use them as simulators of gauge physics itself .",
    "the approach that we take is different ; instead of formulating a redundant description of a strongly interacting system , we take a weakly interacting system with a large number of degrees of freedom and tune the couplings and particle densities so that the low energy physics is identical to thermal qed .    to construct our theory , we necessarily choose a particular gauge .",
    "the hamiltonian of our theory is identical to that of qed in the feynman gauge .",
    "our theory is therefore not a true gauge theory in the formal sense of being described by an equivalence class of distinct actions and wavefunctions ; rather , it is a theory of a relativistic fermion interacting with three neutral , independent massless bosons through a coupling of the form @xmath7 .",
    "all physical observables of qed are gauge independent , and despite its fixed gauge , our simulator should correctly reproduce all such observables .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized in the following manner . in section [ sech2d ]",
    ", we will describe the canonical quantization of qed3 in the feynman gauge , taking care to denote the various terms in the hamiltonian that must be replicated in our cold atom system . in section [ secsli ]",
    ", we will then outline our model and show that its low - energy limit is identical to the hamiltonian formulation of qed3 . at the end of that section",
    "we will describe some of the more dramatic properties of qed3 and how they would manifest themselves in cold atom experiments .",
    "finally , in sections  [ sec1d ] through [ seccon ] we will offer concluding remarks and discuss extensions of our theory to 1 + 1 and 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "our goal is to simulate the euclidean action for 2 + 1 dimensional quantum electrodynamics , @xmath8 we adopt the conventions that spacetime indicies which run from 0 to 2 are represented by greek letters , and objects in boldface will represent the two spatial components of the lorentz 3-vectors .",
    "our imaginary time metric and @xmath9 matricies are @xmath10 and @xmath11 is a two - component fermionic spinor . the @xmath12 are pauli matricies , and @xmath13 is the electromagnetic field strength tensor .",
    "summation is implied for all repeated indicies , and we have abandoned the standard convention of raising and lowering indicies to emphasize that our imaginary time metric is trivial . in section iii",
    "we will generalize this action to massive fermions .",
    "we work in the imaginary time formalism @xcite to ensure that the photon propagator @xmath14 is positive definite and therefore all photon states have positive norm and there are no ghostlike degrees of freedom .",
    "we note that in a non - abelian theory , negative norm degrees of freedom will be found even in the imaginary time formalism .",
    "thus , our approach is not appropriate for simulating qcd .",
    "we will simulate this hamiltonian by designing an optical lattice system that exhibits identical degrees of freedom and feynman rules up to lowest order in powers of momenta .",
    "to arrive at a simple enough form of the action for quantum simulation , we will employ the faddeev - popov gauge fixing procedure @xcite .",
    "this scheme enforces the gauge constraint @xmath15 and then path integrates over @xmath16 to remove the gauge degrees of freedom from the lagrangian .",
    "so long as we restrict ourselves to calculating only gauge - invariant quantities , the integration over @xmath16 can be performed trivially .",
    "this alters the euclidean action by adding a term of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is an arbitrary parameter . if we then choose @xmath19 ( the feynman gauge ) , the off - diagonal terms in the photon propagator cancel out and we are left with the action @xmath20 within this gauge , our system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath21 the @xmath22 operators annihilate a photon of polarization @xmath23 , and @xmath24 ; this is simply the canonical quantization of the free photon hamiltonian .",
    "note that , unlike in minkowski space , @xmath25}= \\delta_{rs } \\delta^{2 } { \\left ( { \\mathbf{k}}-{\\mathbf{p}}\\right)}$ ] describes only positive norm states , since the negative time - time component of the photon propagator is made positive by the rotation to imaginary time .",

    "the ward identity @xcite implies that real photons are transverse , ie @xmath29 for all physical states ; only transverse photons will be produced or destroyed in observable processes .",
    "the momentum - space propagators for the fermion and gauge field are @xmath30 we will now show how cold atoms can be used to directly implement the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) .",
    "and @xmath31 denoted by white and black circles .",

    "overall phases for fermion hopping are labeled in the figure.,width=288 ]    we give two alternative geometries for the lattice confining our fermions .",
    "we require that the system exhibits ",
    "dirac points \" instead of a fermi surface ; all zero- or low - energy fermionic excitations must occur near some finite set of points @xmath34 in momentum space , and have the dispersion relation @xmath35 for small @xmath36 measured with respect to @xmath34 .",
    "the most well - known system of this type is the hexagonal lattice @xcite , realized in condensed matter in graphene @xcite and carbon nanotubes . in cold atoms ,",

    "this effective magnetic field could be realized through a spatially dependent raman coupling to an external laser field @xcite .    to find the band structure , we break the lattice into two sublattices @xmath45 and @xmath31 , depending on whether @xmath46 is even or odd ( figure [ sqlat ] ) .",
    "the momentum space hamiltonian can be written as the dot product of a pair of two - component spinors through a matrix .",
    "this matrix @xmath47 has no diagonal elements because nearest - neighbor hopping always transfers a fermion between sublattices , @xmath48 this hamiltonian produces a dirac cone dispersion about the four @xmath34 points @xmath49 .",
    "only two of these points ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) are distinct ; the others are related to them by symmetry .",

    "one of the three boson species ( @xmath56 ) lives on the same lattice as the fermions and the other two ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) occupy interpenetrating square lattices as shown in figure [ sqlat ] . if the interaction between the bosons and fermions is repulsive , the presence of @xmath57 bosons between a pair of neighboring fermion lattice sites acts as an effective potential barrier that reduces the hopping amplitude between the two sites .",
    "similarly , the presence of the fermions will modulate the boson hopping and lead to a nearest - neighbor repulsion term between bosons and fermions .",

    "this same phase factor was also found in the 2d case , but there it was benign : it simply meant that @xmath193 is produced by bosons on the @xmath188-bonds , and @xmath194 is produced by bosons on the @xmath187-bonds . in the 1d case , however , we can not make such a relabeling ( since no @xmath195 matrix appears in the fermion kinetic term ) .",
    "we can fix eq .",
    "( [ h1dstart ] ) by implementing additional phase factors into the mediated hopping matrix elements .",
    "conceptually , the best way to implement these phases is to work in a larger space , allowing the fermions to hop onto the @xmath188 sites , with a total energy cost of @xmath6 relative to the @xmath187 sites . using the techniques from @xcite",
    ", one can engineer a spatially dependent phase on the hopping matrix elements , and produce a hamiltonian ,    @xmath196    here @xmath197 is the matrix element for a fermion to hop onto a boson site , with @xmath198 , and @xmath6 is the on - site energy .",

    "full 3 + 1 dimensional qed can be simulated by combining the schemes which we have presented for one and two dimensions .",
    "we will work with a cubic lattice formed by layering the 2d square lattice of section iii , with lattice spacing @xmath201 between each layer .",
    "each 2d layer is the same as the lattice of section iii , containing three bosons and one fermion distributed between the various sublattices . between the layers we add a fourth boson species @xmath202 , which occupies the space between every other layer and",
    "can only interact with the fermions through a light - assisted transition as in the 1d case .",
    "we shall then implement additional phases to change the sign of the hopping amplitudes @xmath203 between planes ; we choose the phases such that vertical hopping between sites on the @xmath45 sublattice gets no additional phase but @xmath204-directional hopping matrix elements between sites on the @xmath31 sublattices are opposite in sign .",
    "we ignore any vertical hopping beyond nearest neighbors . under those conditions ,",
    "our free particle hamiltonian is @xmath205 this hamiltonian exhibits eight dirac points , located at @xmath206 , though many of these are degenerate .",
    "we can obtain the necessary bispinor representation by simply combining pairs of them ; for example , the combination of @xmath207 and @xmath208 yeilds the following representation for the lorentz group @xmath209 the @xmath210 component of the gauge field is derived from the @xmath202 bosons in the same manner as in section  [ sec1d ] .",
    "other than ensuring that the sign flips between sublattices are preserved when adding the gauge interaction , the derivation is essentially unchanged .",
    "we have proposed a number of experiments involving neutral atoms in optical lattices which will emulate the properties of relativistic quantum electrodynamics .",
    "these models are technically very difficult to realize , requiring a large number of lasers and atomic species that all must be fine - tuned to produce the desired behavior .",
    "however , the necessary technologies ( optically induced phases , interpenetrating spin dependent lattices , and tunable bose - fermi mixtures ) for our model have all been separately realized in recent experiments .",
    "further , as a weakly coupled route from a lattice model to a lorentz - invariant dynamical gauge theory , the scheme we have proposed here is also of significant theoretical interest .    finally , it would be interesting to establish whether or not this scheme could be extended to simulate more complicated gauge theories , such as non - abelian theories or perturbative gravity .",
    "given the importance of these theories in high energy physics , a method for simulating them in cold atoms would be a very significant development .",
    "the difficulty of this process should not be underestimated .",
    "these theories intrinsically have a very large number of degrees of freedom ; in 2 + 1 dimensions , an su(2 ) theory has nine gauge boson modes ( three components of spacetime with three su(2 ) generators associated with each ) , and an su(3 ) theory has twenty - four !",
    "further , non - abelian gauge theories have boson self - interactions that must be finely tuned to avoid breaking gauge invariance .",
    "worse yet , the gauge fields exhibit ghostlike degrees of freedom with negative norm .",
    "accounting for all of these effects in any scheme would be a daunting .",
    "nonetheless , quantum simulation of non - abelian dynamical gauge theories is a fascinating prospect , and the theory we have described here could be an important first step in that direction .",
