    "galaxy morphology has always been an important observable for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "recent imaging studies using the _ hubble space telescope ( hst)_/wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) and advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) have broadened our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "the advent of wfc3 has given access to the rest - frame optical light of galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "morphological studies of these galaxies show that quiescent systems make up a considerable fraction of the massive galaxy population at @xmath0 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "their structural evolution has been the subject of considerable interest , focusing in particular on their extremely compact nature compared to low - redshift galaxies of similar mass ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; buitrago et al . 2008 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the sizes of these `` red nuggets , '' less than @xmath1 kpc , seem comparable to and sometimes even smaller than the point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the early formation and subsequent size growth of these massive , compact objects present a challenge to current models of galaxy formation and evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is not clear via what pathways they become the massive galaxies of today .",
    "the rarity of these massive , compact galaxies at low redshift implies considerable size evolution between _ z _ = 2 and _ z _ = 0 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; but see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . on average , from _ z _ @xmath2 , these objects would have to increase their size by 34 times while doubling their stellar mass ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , efforts to accurately quantify this evolution are hindered by potential uncertainties in measurement techniques : the mass densities may simply be systematically overestimated due to modeling uncertainties of photometric masses , and/or the sizes may be underestimated due to a lack of imaging depth or other measurement issues ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the basic question of how these high-_z _ galaxies evolve in size , there is also still much debate about how these systems evolve in terms of their fundamental morphological type . by performing galfit fitting on a sample of 14 compact , massive galaxies at _ z _",
    "= 2 , @xcite find that a significant subset of their sample appears highly flattened in projection , which , considering viewing angle statistics , implies those galaxies have pronounced disks .",
    "they claim that 65%@xmath315% of the population of massive quiescent at _ z _ @xmath4 2 galaxies are disk - dominated .",
    "@xcite find that a considerable fraction ( 25%@xmath36% using a definition of bulge - to - total ratio @xmath5 and 40%@xmath37% using a definition of @xmath6 for disk - dominated ) of the most quiescent galaxies , with specific star formation rates @xmath7 , have disk - dominated morphologies , including a small number of essentially pure disk galaxies ( with @xmath8 0.1 ) .",
    "they claim that these passive disks appear to be normal disks in the sense that they show an axial - ratio distribution comparable to that displayed by present - day disks .",
    "this implies that while the massive galaxy population is undergoing dramatic changes at this crucial epoch , the physical mechanisms that quench star formation activity are not obviously connected to those responsible for transforming the morphologies of massive _ z _ @xmath9 2 galaxies into present - day giant ellipticals .",
    "a recent morphological study of nearby elliptical galaxies has opened a new window to understanding the formation and assembly of early - type galaxies .",
    "* hereafter h13 ) present a detailed , comprehensive structural analysis of about 100 representative , nearby elliptical galaxies spanning a range of environments and stellar masses ( @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 ) .",
    "they use galfit 3.0 ( @xcite ) to perform two - dimensional , multi - component decomposition of relatively deep , moderately high - resolution @xmath14-band images acquired as a part of the carnegie - irvine galaxy survey ( cgs ; @xcite ) .",
    "h13 challenge the conventional notion that the main body of giant ellipticals follows a single structure described by a high srsic ( 1968 ) index ( e.g. , @xmath15 ) .",
    "they propose that the global light distribution of the majority ( @xmath475% ) of ellipticals are best described by three srsic components : a compact , inner core with typical effective radius @xmath16 @xmath17 1 kpc and luminosity fraction @xmath18 ; an intermediate - scale , middle component with @xmath19 kpc and @xmath20 ; and an extended , outer envelope with @xmath21 kpc and @xmath22 .",
    "the subcomponents have relatively low srsic indices , in the range @xmath23 .",
    "they also find that the ellipticity of the isophotes systematically increases toward large radii .",
    "they believe that the combination of their model s inner and middle components for high - luminosity ellipticals resembles the compact , massive galaxies at high-_z _ ( @xcite ) .    despite there being codes that can automate the measurement of galaxy properties ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , there are still many disagreements over the analysis techniques , because they are often viewed as being too simple , and what the measurements mean . even stepping up the sophistication",
    ", however , makes interpretation non - trivial unless one has physical motivations for doing so ( h13 ) .",
    "these disagreements inspire other techniques ( @xcite ; @xcite ) to measure galaxies non - parametrically , although each one has its own benefits and shortcomings .",
    "in addition to galaxy shapes being difficult to quantify , many other factors complicate the image analysis of galaxies , including determination of the sky background , the brightness of the galaxy [ signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath24 ) ] , the resolution of the images , @xmath25 surface brightness dimming , finding the best psf , the method employed for modeling the galaxy , and the potential biases of the fitting pipeline .",
    "galaxy simulations are invaluable tools for understanding the performance of quantitative fitting pipelines because they provide control over the aforementioned factors ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite for high-_z _ galaxies and @xcite and @xcite for low-_z _ galaxies ) .    by taking advantage of existing observations , detailed analysis , and the multi - component picture of the local elliptical galaxies from h13 , we address two key questions :",
    "\\1 ) do the quiescent massive galaxies at _ z _ = 2 have sizes comparable with the quiescent massive local galaxies and therefore their observed compactness is not intrinsic but an artifact of inappropriate and insufficient morphological modeling ?",
    "\\2 ) what are the true uncertainties of the size and total luminosity measurements at different @xmath24 levels due to structural complexities ?",
    "two sets of simulations are performed to address these questions .",
    "model galaxies with a single srsic component with parameter ranges that cover the _",
    "hst_/wfc3 observations of the red nuggets are the first set of simulations we perform .",
    "these idealized simulations can determine the robustness of fitting pipelines at different noise levels ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the uncertainties and systematic errors measured from these simulated galaxies can be considered as lower limits .",
    "more informative analysis is done by simulating multi - component galaxies with the properties obtained from h13 . by artificially scaling modern - day galaxies to sizes and  luminosities comparable to those found in galaxies at @xmath0 , we can fit them with single - component srsic models to understand the systematics caused by complexities in galaxy structures .",
    "the differences between the input and output parameters shed light on possible uncertainties and biases in size and total luminosity measurements of the high-_z _ galaxies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 gives the details of the galaxy simulations used throughout this study . in section 3",
    ", we present the main results of our galfit models . in section 4",
    ", we compare our results with similar studies in the literature .",
    "implications for red nuggets are discussed in section 5 , ending with a summary in section 6 .",
    "all the results assume a standard cosmology ( @xmath26 = 71 @xmath27 , @xmath28 = 0.27 , and @xmath29 = 0.73 ) and ab magnitudes .",
    "simulations can determine the robustness of fitting pipelines like galfit . in this section",
    ", we describe the different sets of simulations in detail .",
    "two sets of objects are simulated in order to address different issues .",
    "the first , using a single - component srsic profile , is to establish the baseline capability due only to @xmath24 , under the most idealized situations , and in the absence of any complexities .",
    "this sets the fundamental limits of the technique .",
    "the second set of simulations , by rescaling models of nearby elliptical galaxies and all their sub - components to comparable sizes and @xmath24 found at high _ z _ and fitting them using a single - component srsic model , directly tests the null hypothesis that early - type galaxies have not evolved in size since _ z _ @xmath9 2 .",
    "we use ned wright s cosmology calculatorwright / cosmocalc.html ] to compute redshift - dependent quantities .",
    "we use galfit 3.0 for the simulations .",
    "galfit is an image analysis algorithm that can model profiles of galaxies , stars , and other astronomical objects in digital images .",
    "if successful , the features of interest are summarized into a small set of numbers , such as size , luminosity , profile central concentration , and geometrical parameters .",
    "galfit uses several common functions in the astronomical literature , including : exponential , srsic / de vaucouleurs , nuker , gaussian , king , and moffat . out of all the functions , we exploit only the srsic ( 1968 ) profile and the sky background component .",
    "the sky component fits the background with a plane with a constant slope and therefore can correct for any non - flatness to first order .",
    "the srsic component describes the radial surface brightness profile of a galaxy as        @xmath30\\right \\ } } , \\label{eq : sersic}\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 is the effective radius of the galaxy ( equivalent to @xmath31 , the half - light radius ) , @xmath32 is the surface brightness at @xmath16 , the srsic index @xmath33 describes the profile shape , and the parameter @xmath34 is closely connected to @xmath33 ( @xcite ) . together with position ( _ x _ and _ y _ ) , axis ratio _ b / a _ , and position angle , this profile has seven free parameters .",
    "the srsic profile represents a more general form of the exponential light profile seen in galactic disks ( _ n _ = 1 ; @xcite ) and the _ @xmath35_-law ( de vaucouleurs law ; @xcite ) typical of luminous early - type galaxies ( _ n _ = 4 ) .",
    "modeling with this profile has been explored in detail in several works ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "many authors have used a constant value of _ n _ = 2.0 or 2.5 to crudely distinguish early - type ( bulge - dominated ) from late - type ( disk - dominated ) galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "srsic profiles with higher srsic indices have longer tails that make the analysis of these galaxies more challenging due to greater sensitivity to neighboring objects , to profile mismatch , and to accurate knowledge of the sky background ( see figure  3 of @xcite )",
    ". we will compare our results for different ranges of srsic indices .",
    "sky background and noise are added to all the images in two different ways : ( 1 ) adding an artificial background level with poisson noise using iraf / mknoise ( @xcite ) ; ( 2 ) putting the simulated galaxy on an actually observed background .",
    "although the main focus of this study is galaxies at _ z _ = 2 , our simulations are more generally applicable .",
    "the simulations explore a range of fundamental measurables , i.e. sizes , srsic indices , axis ratio , and @xmath24 . as the simulations extend down to instrumental limits",
    ", they apply to galaxies at any redshifts provided that one first converts apparent magnitude into @xmath24 . as illustration , we compare galaxies at _ z _ = 0.5 , 1.5 , and 2 , to our simulations .",
    "the simulated observed backgrounds are taken from candels ( @xcite ; @xcite ) uds ( ukidss ultra - deep survey ; @xcite ) @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 mosaic images , respectively ( figure [ fig : skies ] ) .",
    "therefore , when local galaxies are rescaled to specifically match in size and @xmath24 of observed galaxies in those filters , _ k_-correction is not required .",
    "the simulated backgrounds resemble the observed backgrounds as they have identical gain , pixel scale , and magnitude zero point ( _ magzpt _ ) as in the uds mosaic images . furthermore , the background root - mean - square ( rms ; the standard deviation from the median sky value ) of the simulated and observed backgrounds are comparable .    all artificially generated galaxies are convolved with a candels uds hybrid psf ( @xcite ) of the filter that corresponds to the redshift of interest .",
    "an important factor in obtaining a best - fit model is the accuracy of the psf .",
    "the effective radii of the red nuggets are comparable to and in some cases smaller than the psf full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "therefore , one may expect some offset in galfit measurements when an inaccurate psf is used .",
    "this issue is studied in the appendix , where we show that the effects of using slightly different psfs are not more than 5@xmath39 on the final model .",
    "one of the most important factors in morphology analysis is @xmath24 .",
    "there are several ways to define @xmath24 because galaxies are extended .",
    "one way , which is somewhat analogous to total @xmath24 , is given by    @xmath40    where three different parameters determine the @xmath24 : the area @xmath41 of the aperture in which the @xmath24 is measured , the galaxy total flux @xmath42 within @xmath41 , and the background rms @xmath43 .",
    "the rms here is the sum of all possible sources of noise , including shot noise from the sky , readout noise , and shot noise in dark current . in this paper",
    ", @xmath41 includes every pixel within @xmath16 . note that this is different from measuring @xmath24 within an aperture with a constant size because the aperture size here is different for each galaxy .",
    "equation [ eq : sn ] , however , may not be the most informative . for various technical reasons ,",
    "it is harder to measure structural properties of low - surface brightness galaxies .",
    "thus , another useful definition is analogous to an average surface brightness , defined as @xmath44 = @xmath45 . here , the ellipticity @xmath46 .",
    "figure 2 shows a set of galaxies and the corresponding @xmath24 definitions .    by adding galaxies to an observed background",
    ", one can study the effect of faint undetected objects or being in the vicinity of bright and/or extended objects .",
    "one way to minimize the effects of neighboring objects is to mask them out .",
    "we accomplish this by running sextractor ( @xcite ) with the parameter _",
    "detection@xmath47threshold _ set to 1.5 . instead of using the sextractor segmentation map ,",
    "the location ( xpeak_image , ypeak_image ) , ellipticity , position angle , and the area of the objects from the sextractor output catalog are used to create a bad pixel mask image .",
    "first , the semi - major axis of each galaxy is calculated by using the measured area and ellipticity of the object .",
    "bad pixel regions are constructed by assigning the center , the semi - major axis , the semi - minor axis , and the position angle of each object .",
    "we double the calculated semi - major and semi - minor axes ( i.e. , quadruple the area ) in order to mask out most of the faint outer parts of the objects .",
    "figure [ fig : skies ] shows the observed backgrounds and bad pixel masks .",
    "these masks are used for galfit modeling . while masking does not fully eliminate the possibility of neighboring contamination ( see @xcite ) , this method is analogous to that of some studies in the literature and is thus informative . together with analysis on idealized backgrounds ,",
    "these two scenarios give an idea of the different levels of systematics .",
    "simulating single - component galaxies is one of the most basic , yet important ways of testing the robustness of fitting pipelines ( @xcite ) .",
    "we simulate more than 10,000 single - component galaxies .",
    "the srsic component parameters are randomly chosen from the following ranges : 0.8 @xmath17 @xmath16 @xmath17 35 pixels ( @xmath4800520 in wfc3/@xmath49 ) , 0.5 @xmath17 @xmath33 @xmath17 5 , and 0 @xmath17 @xmath50 @xmath17 0.8 .",
    "for one _ hst _",
    "orbit , a @xmath24 range between 1 and 1000 within the effective radius of the simulated galaxies roughly corresponds to a magnitude range of 20 @xmath17 @xmath51 @xmath17 27 .",
    "once the galaxies are simulated , we fit each with a single srsic component plus a sky component . for the galaxy component",
    ", the initial parameter guesses include the position of the galaxy ( physical @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) , srsic index , magnitude , effective radius , ellipticity , and position angle .",
    "real galaxies have structures that complicate the analysis .",
    "several recent studies looked into this issue by creating bulge + disk models , and then fitting single - component srsic models to them ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the question was whether the disk components were missed by the analysis technique , therefore leading to underestimation of the sizes .",
    "they found that single - component models were able to recover the magnitude and sizes , with only small systematic errors ( 0%20% ) , and that the multi - component analysis performed better .",
    "while those studies are informative in their own right , there is another complementary approach .",
    "our simulations are designed to more directly test the null hypothesis that elliptical galaxies today are the direct descendants of _ z _ @xmath9 2 galaxies that have undergone no morphological changes in structure or size .",
    "to do so , we start with 100 nearby elliptical galaxies with multi - component decomposition models from h13 that capture the detailed structures down to very low surface brightnesses , accounting for the psf . we then rescaled the composite ( sum of the multiple components ) as a single unit to span a range of sizes and signal - to - noise similar to galaxies at _ z _ @xmath9 2 .",
    "we convolve the composite model with a psf and then perform single - component srsic fits to it .",
    "the rationale for this approach is to be agnostic about the structural nature of high-_z _ systems ( e.g. , whether they are disks or bulges ) because that judgment may itself be entangled with the technique as well as other more subtle technical nuances .",
    "we rescale the sizes and luminosities of the h13 multi - component models to generate about 300 multi - component galaxies with @xmath54 pixels and @xmath24 from a few to 1000 .",
    "this range is relevant for studying massive early type galaxies down to the resolution and @xmath24 limits of _ hst _",
    "observations , regardless of redshift .",
    "images of galaxies analogous to being at _ z _ = 0.5 , 1.5 , and 2.0 are simulated based on the @xmath24 properties of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 ( equivalent to the rest - frame optical ) candels uds images , respectively .    as in the single - component simulations",
    ", we add either a simulated background or an observed background . by using 300 multi - component galaxies as templates ,",
    "more than 6000 galaxies with 5 @xmath17 @xmath24 @xmath17 1000 ( uniformly distributed in logarithmic space ) are simulated .",
    "we analyze the multi - component galaxies in a manner similar to that used to treat the single - component galaxies .",
    "to replicate the most commonly adopted analysis method , we fit every galaxy with a single srsic and sky component .",
    "however , because of the mixture of different components , another method is needed to determine the intrinsic size and other parameters of the galaxy . to establish the baseline for comparison of sizes and other parameters , we employ iraf / ellipse ( @xcite ) , a task that fits elliptical isophotes to images , to create a curve of growth ( cog ) of the cumulative radial flux distribution of the model galaxy",
    "this is generated with an ellipticity and position angle fixed to the radially average value .",
    "no noise is added , and psf convolution is not applied . as the total flux of the galaxy",
    "is known , the cog allows us to obtain a non - parametric estimate of the effective radius , the radius at which half of the total flux is enclosed .",
    "-axis shows the effective radius of 1250 single - component galaxies , and the @xmath53-axis shows the difference between the actual size and the size measured by cog .",
    "black solid and dashed lines indicate the median and 1@xmath43 uncertainties .",
    "the dot - dash line shows zero offset .",
    "the size of galaxies with 1 @xmath17 @xmath16 @xmath17 2 pixels can be overestimated by 5% and with 10% uncertainties . for galaxies with 2 @xmath17 @xmath16 @xmath17 5 pixels ,",
    "the sizes can be measured without any bias and with 5% uncertainties . and for larger galaxies the uncertainties are less than 1% with no bias.[fig : ellipse],width=359 ]                                                        to examine the robustness of our cog analysis , we employ this method to measure the sizes of 1250 single - component galaxies with a large range of sizes ( 1500 pixels ) .",
    "figure [ fig : ellipse ] shows that there is no bias in size measurements for the larger galaxies but the finite size of the pixels makes size determination of the smallest galaxies slightly uncertain .",
    "sizes with 1 @xmath17 @xmath16 @xmath17 2 pixels can be overestimated by 5@xmath39 and with 10@xmath39 uncertainty . for galaxies with 2 @xmath17 @xmath16 @xmath17 5 pixels , the sizes can be measured without any bias and with 5% uncertainty . and for larger galaxies the uncertainties are less than 1% with no bias .",
    "we take these effects into consideration when analyzing the multi - component galaxies .",
    "however , fewer than 2% of the simulated galaxies have @xmath16 @xmath17 3 pixels .",
    "lastly , we note that because the cog technique averages over all elliptical annuli to measure the effective radius , the comparison between cog and single - component srsic fits in principle is imperfect for multi - component galaxies whose isophotes often change in ellipticity with radius .",
    "nevertheless , the general agreement in the size measurements between the two methods is reassuring .",
    "figure [ fig:1comp1 ] and table 1 summarize the results of single - component galaxies with a simulated background ; these are the most idealized simulations to establish the baseline behavior of the analysis technique for the @xmath24 range of interest .",
    "black solid and dashed lines in the scatter plots indicate the median and 1@xmath43 uncertainties of different measurements .",
    "cyan points and cyan solid lines show the results of galaxies with input @xmath33 @xmath17 2.5 , and red points and red dotted lines are for galaxies with @xmath33 @xmath55 2.5 .",
    "to be consistent with the multi - component models later on , where effective radius is more ambiguous to define , the analyzed effective radii are circularized effective radii , @xmath56 .",
    "we see no systematic errors in size , total luminosity , srsic index , or ellipticity measurements down to @xmath51 = 26 . and even at 26 @xmath17 @xmath51 @xmath17 27 the systematic errors are less than @xmath4810@xmath39 .",
    "as expected , the uncertainties increase rapidly with decreasing @xmath24 and particularly for @xmath51 @xmath4 26 .",
    "the srsic index is most vulnerable to large uncertainties .",
    "the simulated images resemble single - orbit _",

    ", @xmath50 = 0 , and @xmath51 = 26 has @xmath57 within @xmath16 .    the uncertainties are , on average , higher for galaxies with larger srsic indices but the systematic offsets are comparable at different @xmath33 ( note that all the simulated single - component galaxies have @xmath33 @xmath17 5 ) .",
    "most of the galaxies with the largest scatter within a magnitude range are ones with the largest sizes , as they have lower mean surface brightness compared to the smaller galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig:1comp2 ] and table 2 summarize the results of single - component galaxies with an observed background , derived from real images .",
    "the scatter is larger but systematic errors are still absent down to @xmath58 .",
    "one of the main sources of the increased scatter is the presence of bright and/or extended objects in the actual images of the observed background ( figure [ fig : skies ] ) .",
    "it is worth pointing out that masking out objects ( using a bad pixel mask for galfit fitting ) is not the most effective way to mitigate the effects of neighboring objects .",
    "instead , one needs to fit the target galaxy and its neighboring objects simultaneously ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the properties ( e.g. , magnitude , size , and srsic index ) of the neighboring objects can affect the fit of the target object .",
    "in particular , neighbors with the largest @xmath33 @xmath59 @xmath16 have the largest effects .",
    "another important factor to consider is that we do not provide an input sigma image ( i.e. , noise map ) for galfit ; instead , we allow galfit to calculate it .",
    "candels images are generated through an extensive process from raw , single exposures to final , drizzled mosaics .",
    "the noise tends to be correlated after the multidrizzle procedure , which may lead to underestimating the noise in actual data ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sigma image generated by galfit may not include all the necessary information about the image characteristics required for a faithful noise map .",
    "@xcite have analyzed the candels uds @xmath49 image and note that the total flux of objects with @xmath60 and the size of typical objects in their sample ( i.e. , @xmath4803 or @xmath485 pixels ) correspond to the typical background flux level measured within the effective radius .",
    "although our images with simulated backgrounds have similar rms to candels uds @xmath49 image , the galaxy flux and the background flux are comparable at @xmath61 for images with simulated backgrounds .",
    "this can explain some of the discrepancies between figure [ fig:1comp1 ] and figure [ fig:1comp2 ] , even at the bright end .",
    "simulated galaxies with multiple components , where the subcomponents are taken from accurate decompositions of nearby galaxies of h13 , provide a better description of the observed galaxy structures than idealized single - component models .",
    "we examine the reliability of measuring the size and total luminosity of multi - component galaxies by single - component fitting .",
    "figure [ fig:3comp1 ] and tables 3 and 4 show the difference between actual and measured effective radii at different @xmath24 ranges for about 7,000 model galaxies in images with simulated ( i.e. idealized ) backgrounds .",
    "the upper , middle , and lower panels give the results at different intervals of size , mean surface brightness , and srsic index , respectively .",
    "black solid and dashed lines in the scatter plots indicate the median and 1@xmath43 uncertainties of different measurements .",
    "the downward - pointing arrows on the top of each subpanel indicate the @xmath24 of a galaxy with @xmath16 = 5 pixels , @xmath50 = 0 , and @xmath51 = 20 or 25 ( one orbit ) .",
    "typical red nugget galaxies in candels have @xmath62 .",
    "a notable feature in figure [ fig:3comp1 ] are the results for galaxies with 6 @xmath17 @xmath33 @xmath17 20 .",
    "note that we do not impose an upper limit on the srsic index ; @xmath33 = 20 is an internal upper limit set by galfit .",
    "it is clear that the fits with @xmath33 @xmath4 6 are generally unreliable .",
    "srsic profiles with @xmath33 @xmath4 4 have long tails . in a regime where the surface brightness of the galaxy is close to the sky level , the flux in the long tail can be overestimated due to the inherent degeneracy between a srsic profile with large @xmath33 and any residual background flux .",
    "this leads not only to overestimating the total flux of the galaxy but also its size .",
    "on the other hand , for all practical purposes , on can correct for this effect by refitting the galaxies with @xmath33 @xmath4 6 by fixing @xmath33 to 6 .",
    "figure [ fig:3comp2 ] demonstrates the significant improvement in the size determination . comparing figures [ fig:3comp1 ] and [ fig:3comp2 ] clarifies that most of the outliers in figure [ fig:3comp1 ] are galaxies with @xmath33 @xmath4 6 .",
    "it is worth noting that because the simulations are based on a finite sample of 100 nearby galaxy `` templates , '' rescaled in luminosity and size , the behavior of the scatter is only pseudo - random , which leads to horizontal striations in the scatter plots of figure [ fig:3comp1 ] .",
    "figures [ fig:3comp1 ] and [ fig:3comp2 ] ( and [ fig:3comp3 ] ) show that when the objects are binned by measured srsic index , the scatter does not appear symmetric in the lowest bin in @xmath33 .",
    "one might interpret the result as the fit missing the outer parts of the galaxies .",
    "however , that offset is deceptive because the objects are plotted according to their measured srsic index rather than intrinsic index ; one does not know the srsic index for real , multi - component galaxies until after the fit . because measured srsic indices are positively correlated in a fit with measured sizes ( @xcite ) ,",
