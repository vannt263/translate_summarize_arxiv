    "ffs was developed to measure transition rates between two locally stable regions @xmath0 and @xmath1 separated by a high , featureless barrier . when the barrier separating these regions contains long - lived metastable states , ffs is generally inaccurate or inefficient , depending on how it is applied .",

    "this model is of interest because it has a first - order phase transition which acts in many ways like an equilibrium phase transition ( it shows critical behavior , nucleation , etc . ) , but the model is manifestly non - equilibrium .",

    "the gains of ffst over ffs are illustrated in appendix b.    thus , the technique follows fruitful paths from the reactive state to the co - poisoned state .",
    "to apply the ffst to the zgb model , we must first define an order parameter , which is used to determine progress towards the poisoned state .",

    "these barriers can be placed before the sampling begins , which we call _ static _ barriers .",

    "[ fig : spanningcluster_pco5256 ] shows that increasing @xmath11 appears to narrow the range of coverage for which spanning has a non - negligible probability of occurring or not occurring , at fixed @xmath65 .",
    "this suggests that the variation in shape of the largest cluster decreases with @xmath11 .",
    "it also appears that reaching a spanning probability of @xmath66% is achieved at @xmath67 independent of @xmath11 at @xmath13 .",
    "this indicates that the average largest cluster is significantly elongated when it begins to span the system ; as seen in fig .",

    "this preferred pathway of wrapping and expanding has also been seen in magnetic memory switching @xcite .",
    "this behavior is to be expected , at least near @xmath74 , where the cluster usually wraps around in one direction . in that case , at the transition point @xmath13 , the system should be equally likely to poison or return to the reactive state , so @xmath75 independent of @xmath11 .",
    "in this article , we introduce forward flux sampling in time ( ffst ) .",
    "we use it to analyze the first - order phase transition in the zgb model .",

    "we found the most probable of these trajectories and found that wrapping and then expanding is the preferred path to poisoning .    at @xmath77 ,",
    "the committor probabilities appears to be independent of system size for large @xmath11 .",
    "we believe that this is a signature of a first - order transition for the following reasons : first , the committor probability is @xmath78 for half coverage , which is has been previously used to determine the transition point @xcite .",
    "second , the matching of the entire curves for various @xmath11 stems from the critical cluster size being infinite at the transition point .",
    "this implies that the probability of a droplet growing is always less than @xmath79 .",
    "the growth probability can not be strongly dependent on the cluster size as clusters of arbitrarily large size must all have roughly the same growth probability , slightly less than @xmath79 . for large lattice sizes , what matters is how close the cluster is to spanning , which is only dependent on the mass of the largest cluster scaled by the total system size .",
    "thus , we have found that the committor probability can be used to locate the first - order transition point of the system .",
    "lastly , we found size - dependent poisoning times for systems well below the transition point .    for the zgb model",
    ", we found that the efficient implementation of ffs , i.e. , a fixed number of crossings in the first stage , gives accurate results .",

    "the ffs algorithm works well for problems with a featureless barrier , i.e. , problems with infrequent but fast transitions .",

    "either grossly underestimates the transition time or becomes nearly as inefficient as direct simulation ( see appendix b for an example ) . in this case",
    "ffs produces a constant gain in simulation efficiency , of the order of ten times faster , whereas the ` efficient ' approach , where a fixed number of crossings is used to calculate the flux rate , can be @xmath81 times faster , as we found in this paper . in this appendix",
    ", we derive the version of ffs , which we call ffst .",
    "we then outline two other variants on ffs which helps us illustrate the connection between ffs and the barrier method which we recently introduced @xcite .",
    "as we explained above , ffs separates the problem of finding rare transition events into two problems : first , finding the rate of leaving the initial region @xmath0 , and second , finding the probability of reaching the final region @xmath1 from the surface of @xmath0 without going back into @xmath0 . finding the rate of leaving @xmath0 typically involves running single a long simulation until it has exited @xmath0 a fixed number of times , say @xmath82 where @xmath46 is the number of trials per barrier in the second step .",
    "the number of crossings divided by the total time of the simulation ( discounting paths that reach @xmath1 ) gives an estimate of the rate of leaving @xmath0 .",
    "this calculation of the flux is accurate only if the trajectories sample capture the important times and features of the entire landscape .",
    "for example , if none of the trajectories generated sample a long lived , metastable state between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the estimated flux would be higher than the true flux .",
    "we show such an example in appendix b.    a simple and correct way to avoid this problem is to run the initial simulation until it reaches @xmath1 one or more times .",
    "however , this is impractical because it effectively solves the problem using brute force , which is what ffs was designed to avoid , and would lead to miniscule efficiency gains over brute - force simulations .",
    "our version of ffs has the accuracy of the ` correct ' calculation and the efficiency of the usual flux calculation .",
    "forward flux sampling in time ( ffst ) , the algorithm we use in this paper , performs ffs in terms of transition times instead of rates .",
    "the problem is decomposed in the same way as ffs@xcite , utilizing the idea of endpoint regions @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in this view",
    ", there are three important times : the time to return inside of @xmath0 from the surface of @xmath0 ( @xmath44 ) , the time to get back to surface of @xmath0 from just inside @xmath0 ( @xmath83 ) , and the time to reach @xmath1 from the surface of @xmath0 ( @xmath84 ) without going back into @xmath0 . the only additional quantity needed to calculate the transition time , @xmath85 , is the probability @xmath86 of reaching @xmath1 from the surface of @xmath0 .",
    "then : @xmath87 if the first term , which represents the total time spent on unsuccessful attempts to reach @xmath1 , is much larger than the time of a successful attempt to reach @xmath1 , which is explicitly used in the construction of ffs , @xmath88(t_{ext}+t_{int } ) \\gg t_f$ ] , and @xmath86 , is small then the above formula simplifies to the inverse of the ffs formula , @xmath89    the efficiency gain of ffst comes from measuring @xmath83 during the first step , and measuring @xmath90 and @xmath86 in the second step . measuring @xmath83 involves counting the time that the initial simulation spent in region @xmath0 . in the second step , paths are allowed to run from the @xmath91 barrier to the @xmath92 or back to @xmath0 .",
