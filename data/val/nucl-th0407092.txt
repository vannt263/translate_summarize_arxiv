    "langer @xcite has shown that the decay rate @xmath0 can be calculated from the partition function @xmath1 via the imaginary part of the free energy @xmath2 ( as usual temperature is measured in mev such that the boltzmann constant is put equal to @xmath3 . )",
    "the parameter @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 ) sets the time scale for the solution @xmath6 which describes the motion of the average trajectory away from the barrier top . using path integrals",
    "langer s formula has extensively been exploited in the framework of the caldeira - leggett model ( clm ) @xcite for dissipative quantum systems . within this model",
    "the decay rate has been studied in great detail from high to very low temperatures .",
    "the region of the `` crossover temperature '' @xmath7 , below which quantum tunneling becomes more important than pure thermal activation has been treated in @xcite ; for reviews on this subject see e.g. @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we want to adapt similar methods to systems like finite nuclei , where the dynamics of the particles is governed by a varying mean field .",
    "different to the clm this field , and hence the `` heat bath '' , changes with the variable which parameterizes the path along which the free energy exhibits the barrier . a first attempt along these lines",
    "was reported in @xcite .",
    "there , the partition function was calculated by accounting for correlations around the mean trajectory which were of rpa - type . in different context",
    "such an approach to @xmath1 has been phrased `` perturbed static path approximation '' ( pspa ) , for details see @xcite . as this method",
    "is based on a quadratic expansion of the effective action about stationary points it suffers the same breakdown as an analogous expansion within the clm ; the rate diverges at the @xmath8 . in the present paper we like to overcome this problem by employing a variational approach to the quantum partition function ,",
    "suggested recently in @xcite .    at finite temperature nuclear collective motion",
    "is damped . in @xcite",
    "this feature was simulated by applying simple energy smearing to the results obtained within the independent particle model ( ipm ) . in the present paper we like to apply a more microscopic picture .",
    "the latter bases on the replacement of the one - body green function of the ipm by dressed ones , accounting in this way for incoherent scattering processes among the particles . in this way connection is established to transport theory for damped collective motion ( see e.g. @xcite ) . indeed , by using linear response functions we are able to introduce microscopically transport coefficients like the inertia @xmath9 , friction @xmath10 or the stiffness @xmath11 , which then may serve as input for the calculation of the decay rate of metastable systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec - partfunc ] we briefly review several approximations to the partition function @xmath1 of interacting many body systems . thereafter in sect .",
    "[ chap - diss ] we take into account residual interactions , apply linear response theory to treat damped harmonic motion and establish the connection to microscopic transport theories . in sect .",
    "[ sec - modify ] we modify the methods of sect .",
    "[ sec - partfunc ] such that dissipation can be treated .",
    "after the derivation of formulas for the decay rate of metastable interacting many body systems in sect .",
    "[ decay ] we want to estimate the accuracy of our results . in the ideal case this should be done with an exactly solvable model for the many body system . however , to the best of our knowledge for damped collective motion , the case we are interested in , such a model does not exist .",
    "for this reason so far we are only able to test in sect .",
    "[ reliability ] our approach at the example of a particle moving in a one - dimensional potential under the influence of damping , leaving a more involved analysis for many body systems for future work .",
    "finally we like to close by discussing our findings and drawing some conclusions .",
    "the collective degree of freedom shall be introduced through a mean field approximation to a separable interaction of the type @xcite @xmath12 .",
    "it is to be added to the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath13 , which at first shall be assumed to be of one body nature .",
    "the total @xmath14 thus is given by @xmath15 for @xmath16 the interaction is attractive and leads to iso - scalar modes in the nuclear case .",
    "the operator @xmath17 is meant to represent an effective generator of collective motion along a fission path . for the evaluation of the partition function @xmath1",
    "we want to exploit functional integrals in imaginary time @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "the two body interaction may then be treated by the hubbard - stratonovich transformation ( hst ) to the mean field hamiltonian @xmath20 = \\hat{h } + q(\\tau ) \\,\\hat{f } \\,.\\ ] ] here , the @xmath21 represents the collective variable .",
    "following @xcite it will be treated by an expansion around an average value @xmath22 defined through @xmath23 .",
    "the deviation will be expanded into the fourier series @xmath24 , with the matsubara frequencies @xmath25 and @xmath26 . as described elsewhere ( see e.g. @xcite )",
    "the partition function can be expressed by the following ( ordinary ) integral over the @xmath27 : @xmath28 in this expression @xmath29 is the @xmath22-dependent effective free energy in the quasi - static picture , left over here in the classical limit , where all @xmath30-dependent deviations from @xmath22 can be neglected . for convenience we introduce the effective free energy @xmath31 which includes quantum effects through the factor @xmath32 .",
    "this correction still is a functional integral in @xmath33-space and specified through an euclidean action @xmath34 .",
    "various existing approximations consist in the way this action is treated . as already indicated through the notation employed in ( [ z - athaly ] ) and ( [ feff ] ) , within the static path approximation ( spa ) the @xmath35",
    "is put equal to unity , which implies to discard all fluctuations around @xmath22 .",
    "corrections to this approximation ( see e.g. @xcite ) are obtained by expanding systematically the action @xmath36 around the static path @xmath22 to some power in the @xmath33 , exhibited here to fourth order .    within the spa+rpa @xcite , the perturbed static path approximation ( pspa ) @xcite or the correlated static path approximation ( cspa ) @xcite the expansion ( [ defa ] ) is truncated after the second order @xmath37 this approximation takes into account quantum fluctuations around @xmath22 on the level of local rpa modes .",
    "it turns out ( see e.g. @xcite ) that the second order coefficients of the pspa are diagonal @xmath38 , with the @xmath39 being given by @xmath40 here , the response function @xmath41 has been introduced , which is defined through the relation @xmath42 where @xmath43 means a general time - dependent deviation from @xmath22 .",
    "mind that the averages have to be calculated from the hamiltonian ( [ 1bham ] ) at _ fixed _",
    "@xmath22 . in this way",
    "the @xmath41 depends on @xmath44 and @xmath22 .",
    "since this @xmath41 only contains excitations of nucleonic nature , @xmath45 which are to be distinguished from collective ones ( to which we will come to below ) , we may call it the _ nucleonic _ or _ intrinsic _ response function . in the following the single particle energies",
    "shall be measured with respect to the chemical potential @xmath46 , which means to write @xmath47 .",
    "the local rpa frequencies @xmath48 appearing in ( [ lambda ] ) must be calculated from the secular equation @xmath49 note that the important factors in the product ( [ lambda ] ) are those which deviate from one .",
    "this happens whenever the @xmath50 is sizably different from the corresponding @xmath51 .",
    "this is so in particular for the typical collective modes , for which for stable isoscalar modes , for instance , one has @xmath52 .    for proper convergence of the path integral for @xmath53 one",
    "needs the condition ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath54 it ensures the pspa to be well defined such that the quantum corrections can be written in the form @xmath55 the restriction ( [ convcond ] ) can easily be translated into a condition on that temperature at which an unphysical divergence of the quantum fluctuations around @xmath22 occurs : @xmath56 . here",
    "@xmath57 can be calculated from the _ unstable _ local rpa mode for which @xmath58 .",
    "the latter is present whenever @xmath59 develops a barrier .    obviously , the unphysical divergence at @xmath7 is a deficiency of the pspa .",
    "it can be cured by accounting for inharmonicities in the expansion ( [ defa ] ) of the action . to be able to lower the breakdown temperature to @xmath60 it is sufficient to concentrate on the three coefficients @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 and",
    "neglect the remaining ones @xcite .",
    "this improved approximation was called extended perturbed static path approximation ( epspa ) . for @xmath64",
    "the quantum correction factor may then be expressed by the form @xmath65 \\,\\textrm{erfc } \\left [ x(\\beta , q_{0 } ) \\right ] \\",
    "\\prod_{r>1 } \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{r}(\\beta , q_{0 } ) } \\,.\\ ] ] the quantity @xmath66 is given in terms of the third and fourth order inharmonic terms of the euclidean action ( [ defa ] ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath67 and @xmath68 can be expressed through one body green s functions @xmath69 corresponding to the static part of the hamiltonian ( [ 1bham ] ) .",
    "details of the calculation can be found in @xcite . with fermi occupation numbers denoted by @xmath70 the general coefficient @xmath71 consists of a sum of terms like @xmath72 the @xmath73 or the higher order coefficients are of similar structure .",
    "recently for the many body system studied here , a variational approach to the quantum corrections @xmath32 of ( [ feff ] ) has been developed in @xcite .",
    "based on the euclidean action of the pspa ( [ s - pspa ] ) a reference action @xmath74 is introduced , where the rpa frequencies @xmath50 appearing in ( [ lambda ] ) are replaced by variational parameters @xmath75 : @xmath76 the @xmath75 are adjusted such that the expectation value @xmath77 with respect to the @xmath78 and consequently the effective free energy ( [ feff ] ) is minimized .",
    "accounting in the action ( [ defa ] ) for inharmonic terms up to fourth order and using the abbreviation @xmath79 within this approximation the correction factor of the variational approach can be written as @xcite @xmath80 here , the fourth order coefficient @xmath71 again is calculated according to ( [ cauchy ] ) . for convergence of the double sum in the second line of ( [ defcfkv ] )",
    "the behavior of @xmath71 at large @xmath81 is crucial . by inspection of ( [ cauchy ] ) , using the unperturbed green s functions ( [ green - freq - ipm ] ) and @xmath82 , one can convince one - self that @xmath71 falls off rapidly enough to assure convergence .",
    "this variational approach @xcite to the partition function of an interacting many body system improves the accuracy of the pspa and the epspa . moreover , even in cases where the static free energy @xmath29 develops a barrier ( as a function of @xmath22 ) , this novel approach still is applicable below @xmath7 or @xmath60 . evidently , this variational approach is the easier to handle the fewer variational parameters @xmath83 one needs to introduce . for the present formulation the latter",
    "are unequivocally related to the rpa frequencies @xmath84 of the secular equation ( [ secular ] ) . in principle , the latter has as many solutions as there are p - h excitations . however , as already discussed below ( [ lambda ] ) , not all of them are equally important for collective motion . in the ideal case",
    "the latter is dominated by only a few or eventually by just one prominent mode .",
    "then it suffices to concentrate on these or this latter one(s ) @xcite .",
    "so far the operator @xmath13 appearing in ( [ twobodham ] ) and ( [ 1bham ] ) is identified with that of the independent particle model ( ipm ) , with the corresponding excitations given by ( [ nuclfreq ] ) and the one body green s functions by ( [ green - freq - ipm ] ) .",
    "the response function defined by ( [ defchi ] ) can be written in the form @xmath85 .",
    "calculated from the ipm its imaginary part @xmath86 consists of a sum of @xmath87-functions located at _ discrete _ energies . however , the ipm neglects the _ residual two body interaction _ between the nucleons , which describes the incoherent scattering of particles and holes and consequently couples the @xmath88p@xmath88h excitations of ( [ 1bham ] ) to @xmath89p@xmath89h excitations and true compound states .",
    "it is this residual interaction which in the end is responsible for genuine relaxation processes and , hence , for damping of collective motion . to account for such effects",
    "we will take a pragmatic point of view . rather than to embark on the difficult ( if at all feasible ) task to account for the residual interaction in full glory we will simply take over the factorization of the response function into one body green s functions @xmath90 , which using the corresponding spectral densities @xmath91 leads to @xmath92 \\,.\\ ] ] for a more detailed description",
    "we refer to @xcite where also references to earlier work can be found .",
    "different to the ipm we _ dress _ the green s functions by self - energies @xmath93 and write @xmath94 instead of ( [ green - freq - ipm ] ) .",
    "these self - energies are calculated from @xmath95 with the following _ phenomenological ansatz _ for the widths @xmath96}\\,.\\ ] ] as for the two parameters introduced this way , the values @xmath97 and @xmath98 have been used in the past ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it can be said that at zero temperature the widths calculated this way are in good agreement with empirical data for single particle excitations @xcite .",
    "moreover , at @xmath99 forms of this type have been used in @xcite in analyses of experimental results within optical model type approaches , for more details see sect .",
    "4.2.3 . of @xcite .",
    "we should like to note that the factorization assumption leading to ( [ resp - green ] ) is applied to describe the _ intrinsic _ dynamics but _ not _ that of collective modes .",
    "one may therefore argue that coherent effects are small , in particular at larger thermal excitations .",
    "after all the underlying spa is meant to represent the high temperature limit .",
    "we may proceed now to establish connection to microscopic transport theories like the one described in @xcite . to this end",
    "it us useful to introduce the _ collective _ response function defined by @xmath100 where @xmath101 stands for an external field coupled to ( [ 1bham ] ) via @xmath102 .",
    "as is well known ( see e.g. @xcite or @xcite ) it can be obtained from the nucleonic response function of ( [ defchi ] ) through @xmath103 its poles are given by the solutions of the secular equation ( [ secular ] ) . very similar to the situation discussed in connection with ( [ lambda ] ) , not all those poles @xmath84 contribute equally strongly . in the ideal case _",
    "one _ of them is shifted down to frequencies which are much smaller than the corresponding nucleonic excitations ( @xmath104 for stable iso - scalar modes ) .",
    "moreover , it may acquire a considerable part of the overall strength .    in order to take into account dissipative effects",
    "we perform two modifications .",
    "as mentioned previously , the nucleonic response function @xmath41 is calculated from the dressed green s functions ( [ green - freq ] ) instead of ( [ green - freq - ipm ] ) .",
    "using the @xmath105 of ( [ selfimag ] ) the imaginary part @xmath106 becomes a continuous function of @xmath107 .",
    "as we are interested in a description of _ slow _ iso - scalar collective motion , as given for instance for nuclear fission , we will concentrate on the lowest lying ( pair of ) poles of the ( locally defined ) collective response function ( [ chicoll ] ) .",
    "this truncated form is fitted by the response function of a damped harmonic oscillator of inertia @xmath9 , stiffness @xmath11 and damping @xmath10 @xmath108 then , instead of several @xmath84 only one collective mode @xmath109 is left over .",
    "the frequency @xmath109 and the effective damping coefficient @xmath110 are defined as follows : @xmath111 the parameter @xmath110 indicates underdamped ( @xmath112 ) or overdamped motion ( @xmath113 ) . after these modifications , which may be summarized as @xmath114 the secular equation ( [ secular ] ) for the local collective modes reduces to the equation @xmath115 its solutions are given by the two frequencies @xmath116 in contrast to the rpa frequencies @xmath84 of the ipm",
    ", the @xmath117 have a _ finite imaginary part_. this implies a _ damped _ local collective motion due to the influence of the residual interaction .    at this place",
    "it is important to stress that the transport coefficients @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 or @xmath121 and @xmath122 have been derived from a _ microscopic quantum theory _ starting from the separable two body interaction ( [ twobodham ] ) . like the response function itself , all of them depend on the temperature @xmath123 and the collective coordinate @xmath22 . with respect to nuclear collective motion this dependence may be considered a great advantage over the caldeira - leggett model ( clm ) @xcite , which is often used to describe open quantum systems ( see e.g. @xcite ; for a criticism from nuclear physics point of view , see @xcite ) .",
    "there , the transport coefficients are not calculated microscopically .",
    "rather they are introduced as parameters which are independent of @xmath124 and @xmath22 .",
    "this latter feature goes along with the fact that in the clm the set of intrinsic degrees of freedom , which acts as the `` heat bath '' for the collective ones , is modeled by a set of _ fixed _ harmonic oscillators .",
    "the latter do not vary with the collective degree of freedom , and so does the spectral density .",
    "such an assumption is not applicable to nuclear fission .",
    "there the heat bath for collective motion is given by the nucleonic degrees of freedom which move in a mean field which depends on the nuclear shape and thus varies with the collective variable .",
    "in this section we study how the inclusion of dissipative effects modifies the approximations put together in sect .",
    "[ sec - partfunc ] in formal sense .",
    "first we look at the pspa . after the reduction ( [ replacechi ] ) to a single damped mode an evaluation of @xmath125 ( see ( [ lambda ] ) and ( [ chicoll ] ) ) leads to @xmath126 here , the ( inverse ) time scale @xmath127 and the quantity @xmath128",
    "have been introduced .",
    "a calculation of the nucleonic response function @xmath129 from ( [ oscresp2 ] ) by inversion of the formula ( [ chicoll ] ) shows that @xmath130 plays the role of the nucleonic frequencies . in _ dissipative pspa _ the form of the quantum corrections to the classical partition function defined in ( [ z - athaly ] ) does not change as compared to the ipm ( [ defcpspa ] ) .",
    "only the @xmath39 are replaced by the @xmath131 of ( [ lambda - osc ] ) . the convergence condition ( [ convcond ] ) now turns to @xmath132 and explicitly reads @xmath133 in the case of stable modes with @xmath134 this condition is always fulfilled . for unstable modes with @xmath135 , in analogy to ( [ t0 ] )",
    "the local crossover temperature @xmath136 is given by the smallest root of the l.h.s .",
    "of the inequality ( [ condt0diss ] ) . using the effective damping @xmath110 of ( [ varpieta ] ) this @xmath136 becomes @xmath137 its maximal value @xmath138 defines the global crossover temperature .",
    "like in the clm for dissipative quantum systems ( see e.g. @xcite ) we find that damping @xmath139 diminishes this @xmath7 .",
    "concerning the anharmonic terms of the euclidean action there is an important difference between our approach and the clm . in the latter the conservative and",
    "the dissipative forces are decoupled from each other .",
    "as one implication , for instance , the inharmonic terms of the potential @xmath140 with @xmath141 are not modified by dissipative effects . in the case of interacting many body systems",
    "the situation is more complicated : the replacement of the unperturbed green s functions ( [ green - freq - ipm ] ) by the dressed ones ( [ green - freq ] ) not only leads to a finite damping strength @xmath110 and a change in the frequency of the local harmonic motion @xmath117 . due to the structure ( [ cauchy ] ) of the expansion coefficients of the euclidean action ( [ defa ] ) also the inharmonic terms are influenced by this replacement , such that @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "taking into account dissipative effects for the quantum corrections of the epspa along the lines of @xcite one can easily rederive ( [ c - epspa ] ) , but with @xmath144 and @xmath145 where @xmath146 using the variational approach in order to account for dissipative features the form @xmath147 with @xmath148 is used as reference action .",
    "the trial action ( [ replace_diss ] ) contains _ only one _ variational parameter @xmath149 and , analogously to the case sketched in sect .",

    "there the quantum partition function of a particle of mass @xmath9 in a one - dimensional potential @xmath156 and an oscillator heat bath environment has been studied within the clm . using the ( inverse ) time scale ( [ taukin ] ) and the fluctuation width @xcite @xmath157 to fourth order in @xmath158 the quantum corrections read @xcite : @xmath159 \\,a^{2}(\\beta , q_{0 } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{\\beta}{8 } \\,v^{(4)}(q_{0 } ) \\,(a^{2}(\\beta , q_{0}))^{2 } + \\mathcal{o}(a^{6 } ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] recalling the definitions of @xmath160 and @xmath161 in ( [ deflambda - osc ] ) and ( [ defpir - osc ] ) respectively , the terms of ( [ c_var_diss ] ) and ( [ c_fkv_diss ] ) correspond to each other in the order of their appearence . in ( [ c_var_diss ] )",

    "@xmath165 and @xmath166 is crucial .",
    "this difference can finally be traced back to the different path integral measures in both cases .",

    "one might think to take the lipkin - meshkov - glick model ( lmgm ) @xcite in the version of @xcite .",
    "indeed , in this model the free energy @xmath59 develops a barrier below a critical temperature .",
    "this barrier separates two minima in a symmetric , bound system .",
    "therefore it is not possible to introduce a decay rate in proper sense .",
    "also based on the lmgm in @xcite an exactly solvable model for many body systems has been developed , which allows to study the fission process .",
    "unfortunately , both models do not allow for exact solutions at finite damping .    because of this problem we will follow a different strategy and look at the much simpler one - dimensional case of a particle of mass @xmath9 moving in the cubic potential @xmath204 with minimum at @xmath205 , barrier at @xmath206 and with a barrier height @xmath207 , although our approach is suitable for many body systems .",
    "for this situation the quantum decay rate has been calculated _ exactly _ with help of the clm for all temperatures @xmath208 and various damping strengths @xcite .",
    "in addition , in the fkv there exists an analog of the variational approach used in the present paper , namely for a particle moving in a one - dimensional potential .",
    "unfortunately , in its original form @xcite the fkv is not directly applicable to the potential ( [ potv ] ) .",
    "the reason is that in the expansion ( [ c_fkv_diss ] ) only derivatives of @xmath209 of _ even _ order contribute .",
    "consequently , like for the harmonic oscillator , for a cubic potential the fkv reduces to a gaussian approximation and inharmonic terms are not seen . to cure this problem , in @xcite besides the trial frequency @xmath210",
    "a second variational parameter has been introduced , which controls the minimum of the local oscillator . here",
    ", we follow a simpler strategy and consider the _",
    "stable _ fourth order potential @xmath211 which by adjusting @xmath212 and @xmath213 can be fixed such that it reproduces the barrier region of ( [ potv ] ) to arbitrarily high accuracy . by application of the formulas ( [ r - t > t0 ] ) and ( [ r - t < t0 ] ) , for which the free energy has to be evaluated for the particle of mass @xmath9 in the potential ( [ potw ] ) ,",
    "one gets ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath214 instead of ( [ rate - hight - class])([rate - lowt - class ] ) . using ( [ c_fkv_diss ] ) for the calculation of the correction factor ( [ quantcorr ] )",
    "one can get an _",
    "estimate _ on the accuracy of the formulas derived in sect .",
    "[ decay ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - vwweff ] we show the barrier region of the potentials @xmath156 and @xmath215 with barrier height @xmath216 .",
    "the global minimum of the potential @xmath215 is found at @xmath217 ( not shown in the figure ) and is of value @xmath218 . because of the large depth of this minimum a thermally activated flux originating from this minimum is strongly suppressed .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - vwweff ] is the `` effective classical potential '' @xcite @xmath219 for two effective damping strengths and a given temperature .",
    "it is the analog of ( [ feff ] ) evaluated in the variational approach and contains quantum corrections @xmath220 , which are taken from ( [ c_fkv_diss ] ) with @xmath221 replaced by @xmath222 . as compared to @xmath223 the effective classical potential @xmath224 has a smaller barrier and slightly smaller stiffnesses at @xmath225 and @xmath226 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - ratew ] we show the @xmath44-dependence of the rate formulas in logarithmic representation , for two effective damping strengths .",
    "the results of two different calculations are presented .",
    "the one denoted by `` fkv1 '' ( fully drawn line ) is evaluated by using formulas ( [ rate - v - lowt ] ) and ( [ rate - v - hight ] ) , with the quantum corrections @xmath203 taken from ( [ quantcorr ] ) and ( [ c_fkv_diss ] ) . for the second calculation ( `` fkv2 '' , fully drawn line with symbols ) the saddle point approximation is applied directly to the effective classical potential ( [ wfkv ] ) .",
    "the _ quantal _",
    "rate is calculated from the formulas @xmath227 where @xmath228 is the ( temperature - dependent ) effective barrier height within the fkv , which is smaller than @xmath229 , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig - vwweff ] .",
    "please note that fkv2 is a less drastic approximation to the @xmath22-integral for @xmath1 than fkv1 .",
    "in addition we show in fig .",
    "[ fig - ratew ] the classical rate as a dotted line , for which @xmath230 .",
    "the analog of the pspa rate for a particle moving in a one - dimensional potential takes into account quantum effects via a gaussian approximation . in order to keep the figure transparent",
    "these curves are not shown here .",
    "the inverse crossover temperature @xmath231 , however , where the pspa formalism breaks down due to a divergence of @xmath232 , is marked by arrows . for low temperatures @xmath169 also the result of h.  grabert et al .",
    "@xcite is plotted ( dashed line ) . taking from tab",
    "i and ii of @xcite the relevant quantities , these results were obtained from an exact numerical treatment of the dynamical `` bounce solution '' @xmath233 .",
    "the classical decay rate shows the purely exponential behavior known from arrhenius law .",
    "the rates derived from fkv1 and fkv2 coincide with the classical result at high temperatures ( small @xmath44 ) but show enhancement at larger @xmath44 . in the crossover region",
    "@xmath234 these approximations smoothly connect the classical rate with the result of grabert et al . for @xmath169 .",
    "for very low temperatures ( @xmath235 ) , however , fkv1 and fkv2 deliver bad results , too . instead of converging to a finite limit",
    ", both versions qualitatively behave more like the classical rate and fall off exponentially .",
    "this can be understood as follows : also the fkv is basically a _ static _",
    "approximation that incorporates inharmonic terms by smearing out the potential locally , see fig .",
    "[ fig - vwweff ] .",
    "this works well as long as the quantum fluctuations are not too large , as given for moderate to high temperatures . at very low temperatures ,",
    "however , there is no way around accounting for the full nonlinearity of the _ dynamical _ bounce solution @xmath236 , which minimizes the euclidean action for @xmath169 and therefore gives the leading contribution to the decay rate . due to this limitation of the variational approach",
    ", it would simply be asking too much to expect good agreement with the fully quantum rate even at extremely small temperatures . as the fkv2 contains more information about the quantum effects than the fkv1 it underestimates the rate less dramatically at low temperatures . especially in the region @xmath237",
    "fkv2 still delivers acceptable results where fkv1 is no longer reliable .",
