    "after the pioneering neutrino experiments performed at homestake ( south dakota , usa )  @xcite and kamioka ( gifu , japan )  @xcite , and the great achievements by super - kamiokande  @xcite , kamland  @xcite , both in kamioka , and sno  @xcite ( sudbury , canada ) experiments which provided strong evidence of neutrino oscillation , it has been well recognized that deep underground laboratories can offer an excellent environment for neutrino experiments as well as for a variety of interesting scientific programs which include several different fields , from particle physics , astrophysics , nuclear physics , to biology , geology and geophysics .",
    "see @xcite for a review of the world s underground laboratories .",
    "experiments searching for very rare events , such as the ones induced by neutrinos or dark matter interactions , proton decay or performing low energy nuclear cross section measurements , can not be carried out at the earth s surface mainly due to the backgrounds induced by cosmic rays .",
    "for these experiments a reduction of the cosmogenic backgrounds is crucial .",
    "this can be accomplished by having enough rock overburden , making clear the reason for going deep underground .",
    "recently it was proposed  @xcite to build the first underground laboratory in the southern hemisphere by digging a cave off one of the two 14 km long agua negra tunnels .",
    "these tunnels will be constructed under the andes , the longest continental mountain range in the world , to connect chile s region iv and argentina s san juan province .",
    "they will provide a link between the port of coquimbo , chile ( on the pacific ocean ) , and the port of porto alegre , brazil ( on the atlantic ocean ) , and several nearby cities , in order to facilitate trade between asia and mercosur ( mercado comn del sur or common southern market in english ) which is an economic and political agreement among argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay .",
    "while the exact location of the laboratory inside the tunnel is still under study , the rock overburden could be as large as @xmath1 1.7 km , allowing to significantly reduce backgrounds from cosmic ray origin .",
    "the name given to the proposed laboratory is andes ( agua negra deep experiment site ) .",
    "if such an underground laboratory is constructed , it could provide a variety of interesting scientific opportunities for dedicated studies of neutrinos , dark matter searches and nuclear astrophysics  @xcite , among other things .",
    "the current preliminary design of the andes laboratory is as follows  @xcite .",
    "there will be two large experimental halls with dimensions of @xmath2 m@xmath3 and @xmath4 m@xmath3 , and one smaller hall for offices and multidisciplinary experiments with size of @xmath5 m@xmath3 .",
    "in addition , there will be two experimental pits , one is a smaller ultra - low radiation pit with 8 m of diameter and 9 m of height , the other is a large single experiment pit with 30 m of diameter and 30 m of height .",
    "we are particularly interested in this large pit where a liquid scintillator detector could be installed and used in a possible neutrino program for the andes .",
    "as demonstrated by kamland  @xcite , borexino  @xcite , as well as the recent @xmath6 reactor experiments , double chooz  @xcite , daya bay  @xcite and reno  @xcite , liquid scintillator detectors have a very good capability to observe @xmath7 through the inverse beta decay reaction , @xmath8 .",
    "they also can work with a low energy threshold and provide good energy resolution . as a possible candidate for",
    "the andes neutrino detector one could consider a kamland  @xcite , borexino  @xcite or sno+  @xcite like liquid scintillator detector with a fiducial mass of a few kt . in this paper , we assume a liquid scintillator detector based on alkyl benzene ( c@xmath9h@xmath10c@xmath11h@xmath12 ) , which will be used for the sno+ detector , with a fiducial mass of 3 kt , containing @xmath13 free protons as targets , as our reference neutrino detector at the andes , unless otherwise stated .",
    "we focus on the detection of neutrinos originating from some radioactive elements inside the earth , the so called _ geoneutrinos _ , and neutrinos coming from a core collapse supernova ( sn ) in our galaxy ( hereafter sn implies core collapse supernova ) . for reviews on these subjects , see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite for geoneutrinos and ref .",
    "@xcite for sn neutrinos .",
    "some preliminary results of this work can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the first successful observations of geoneutrinos by kamland  @xcite and borexino  @xcite open a new window to study the chemical composition of the earth .",
    "it is believed that the geoneutrino flux has a local dependency  @xcite , hence having more detectors in different parts of the earth capable of measuring such neutrinos is highly welcome . since the andes laboratory is surrounded by a thick continental crust",
    ", we expect a geoneutrino flux larger than at kamioka or gran sasso , which is interesting to confirm experimentally .",
    "moreover , compared to other existing underground laboratories , there are very few nuclear reactors around the andes location - a valuable advantage as reactor neutrinos are one of the main backgrounds for the measurement of geoneutrinos .",
    "after the historical observations of sn neutrinos from sn1987a occurred in the large magellanic cloud by kamiokande  @xcite , imb  @xcite , and baksan  @xcite detectors , it is well understood that such sn neutrinos can play a very important role in uncovering the physics of supernovae as well as some properties of the neutrinos themselves , such as mass , lifetime , magnetic moment , etc  @xcite .",
    "the low rate of nearby sn , which occurs close enough to the earth so that it can be observed also by neutrinos , is another strong reason for having as many simultaneously operating neutrino detectors as possible , in order to take advantage of such a rare opportunity .",
    "the additional new neutrino detector would also help in making a quick alert to astronomers about the occurrence of a nearby sn event through the supernova early warning system ( snews ) network  @xcite .",
    "the andes neutrino detector , if constructed , can certainly make some relevant contribution to sn neutrino observations .",
    "furthermore , the location of the andes laboratory in the southern hemisphere can provide a better chance to observe the earth matter effect for sn neutrinos by combining with other detectors in the northern hemisphere .",
    "if earth matter effect is observed , the neutrino mass hierarchy may be determined and , at the same time , evidence that different sn neutrino flavors manifest significantly different energy spectra can be provided .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : geoneutrinos ] we discuss in detail the potential of the andes neutrino detector for geoneutrino observations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sn - neutrinos ] we discuss sn neutrino observation at the andes neutrino detector .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to discussions and conclusions of our results .",
    "while we follow previous works for most of the calculations done in this work , for the sake of completeness and to be self - contained , we describe some details of our numerical calculations in the appendices .",
    "the deep interior of the earth , governed by high pressure and temperature , is the last frontier on our planet , which has not yet been explored by a human being .",
    "the deepest hole ever made so far is 12.3 km down from the earth s",
    "surface  @xcite , only about 0.1% of the earth s diameter , and so even the top of the mantle has not yet been reached . in the near future , a direct access to the upper mantle will be possible as part of the missions of the international scientific research program named iodp ( integrated ocean drilling program)@xcite .",
    "however , to reach the lower part of the earth s mantle , located at a depth of about 660 km from the surface , seems to be an impossible task .",
    "so far , there are basically two different approaches to overcome the direct inaccessibility of the earth s underground below 10 km : seismology and geochemistry .",
    "seismological data permit us to indirectly reconstruct the matter density profile of the whole earth .",
    "geochemistry , however , can only access the composition of the earth close to the surface . for",
    "that one uses various rock samples coming from the earth s crust as well as very limited samples from the top of the mantle , thanks to volcanic activity and orogeny .    in 2005 the kamland experiment  @xcite",
    "reported for the first time the detection of @xmath7 coming from the decay chains of the radioactive isotopes @xmath14u and @xmath15th in the earth , by using the inverse beta decay reaction @xmath16 .",
    "these geoneutrinos can provide useful information not only relevant to the earth s interior chemical composition but also shed light on the source of the terrestrial heat production , opening a window to a new scientific field , _ neutrino geophysics _ or _ neutrino geoscience_. in 2010 , another experiment , borexino , located in the gran sasso laboratory in italy also reported the measurement of geoneutrinos  @xcite , further contributing to the start of neutrino geoscience .",
    "a partial list of previous works on geoneutrinos can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    -2.6 cm 0.3 cm     -2.2 cm    it is estimated that the entire earth generates about 40 tw , corresponding to @xmath1 10,000 reactors .",
    "it has been considered that most ( or all ) of the heat is generated by the energy deposited by the decay of radioactive elements like u , th and k in the earth s interior . by measuring geoneutrinos , which are the direct product of such decays",
    ", one can infer the total amount of u and th inside the earth .",
    "we note that the amount of k can not be inferred directly by the current detection method since the energy of geoneutrinos coming from k is below the threshold of the inverse beta decay reaction .",
    "the measured geoneutrino flux , reported recently by the kamland experiment  @xcite , is @xmath17 @xmath18s@xmath19 . by taking into account neutrino oscillations",
    ", this corresponds to a total emitted flux of @xmath20 @xmath18s@xmath19 . on the other hand ,",
    "borexino experiment  @xcite reported in terms of the observed number of events , @xmath21 events/(100 ton yr ) at 68% ( 99.73 % ) cl .",
    "this result is about 70 % higher than that obtained by kamland  @xcite , though both results are consistent with each other within the experimental and theoretical uncertainties .    by combining the results from kamland and borexino",
    ", the observed geoneutrino flux corresponds to a heat production of @xmath22 tw  @xcite .",
    "while borexino seems to favor , kamland results disfavor the so called fully radiogenic model , the model where all the terrestrial heat comes from the decay of the radioactive elements in the earth crust and mantle .",
    "kamland alone disfavors this model at 98.1% cl while the combined data of these two experiments slightly reduces the significance of this rejection to 97.2% cl  @xcite .      for various reasons it would be very interesting if the measurement of geoneutrinos can also be done at the andes laboratory .",
    "first we note that the location of the andes laboratory , 30@xmath2315 s and 69@xmath2353 w , is surrounded by the andes mountain range which means that the thickness of the crust around the laboratory is significantly larger than the average earth crustal thickness , leading to an expected larger geoneutrino flux .",
    "this is because in the earth s crust the concentration of u and th is expected to be significantly larger than in the deeper mantle .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : thickness - crust ] we present the isocontour map of the earth crust thickness based on the model found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : thickness - crust - andes ] we present the magnified version of fig .",
    "[ fig : thickness - crust ] around the andes laboratory . from these figures",
    ", we can appreciate the difference of the local crust thickness around the andes laboratory in comparison with other locations on our planet .",
    "indeed , roughly speaking , the expected geoneutrino flux at the andes laboratory site is larger than that for kamland and borexino by about 30 % and 20 % , respectively , as we will see below .",
    "it is important to confirm such local dependence of the geoneutrino fluxes . because of such a local ( site ) dependence",
    ", it would be also very interesting to measure the geoneutrino flux at a location surrounded by oceanic crust , such as in hawaii  @xcite , where the main contribution to the geoneutrino flux is expected to come from the decay of radioactive elements in the mantle .",
    "-0.6 cm -0.2 cm   but around the andes laboratory . , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=71.0% ]    -1.8 cm    second , there are very few nuclear reactors near the andes laboratory which is a great advantage for measuring geoneutrinos . as it is well know from the results of the kamland experiment , low energy @xmath24 produced by nuclear reactors",
    "is one of the most important backgrounds for geoneutrino observation .",
    "indeed , the borexino detector , despite being smaller than kamland , demonstrated so far a better performance than kamland as far as geoneutrino measurements are concerned .",
    "this seems to be due to the fact that borexino , located in the middle of italy where there are no nearby reactors , is exposed to a much lower @xmath25 background from reactor origin .",
    "taking into account the nearest argentinian nuclear reactors , the embase 2.1 gw ( thermal power ) as well as the atucha i 1.2 gw and atucha ii 2.1 gw reactors , which are located , respectively , 560 km and 1080 km away from the andes laboratory , we have estimated a total reactor background of 8.8 events / yr/3 kt and 2.2 events / yr/3 kt in the geoneutrino energy range .",
    "these numbers are given in the absence of neutrino oscillations , which will further reduce them if taken into account .",
    "though we have considered only the contribution from these nearby reactors , our estimation is similar to the one which can be inferred from fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite which shows the world map of the isocontours of the expected number of events induced by neutrinos coming from 201 nuclear reactor power stations all over the world .",
    "the reactor neutrino background we found for andes is more than 10 times smaller than the one expected for borexino , 5.7 events / yr/100 tons ( total number of reactor @xmath7 induced events in the presence of oscillation )  @xcite .",
    "we follow our ( two of the authors of this paper ) previous work  @xcite with some update and improvements , in order to compute the differential flux of @xmath7 produced in the decay chain of radioactive isotopes @xmath14u and @xmath15th that will be measured at a detector position @xmath26 on the earth , which can be expressed by the following integral performed over the earth s volume @xmath27 ,    -0.5 cm @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the matter density , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are , respectively , the mass abundance , half - life , atomic mass and the number of @xmath25 emitted per decay chain corresponding to element @xmath34u , @xmath15th , @xmath35 is the normalized spectral function for element @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "we will assume the concentrations of u and th , @xmath30 , take different values in the earth s crust and mantle layers as given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "these are our reference values which are based on ref .",
    "oceanic and continental earth s crust are divided , respectively , into two and four layers whereas the earth s mantle is divided into two layers ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "we assume no u and th in the earth s core .",
    "the so called fully radiogenic model assumes higher u , th and k abundances in the mantle in order that the total observed earth s heat can be fully explained by the decay of these radio active elements .",

    "s core these mass abundances are assumed to be zero . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     since we can not compare the number of events at the same detector with and without earth matter effect , we need two or more detectors to be able to conclude something on the matter effect . for simplicity and for the sake of discussion ,",
    "let us consider only two detectors at two different sites , say , one at kamioka ( sk ) and other at andes .",
    "suppose that the arrival of the sn neutrinos at the andes detector is shadowed by the earth , while at sk detector at kamioka is not .",
    "then , to some extent , within the statistical and systematic errors , one can try to infer the expected sn spectra at sk from the observed ones at andes ( or vice versa ) as if the sk detector _ were also shadowed _ like andes .",
    "if both detectors receives sn neutrinos without earth matter effect these two spectra must agree with each other but with the matter effect , they are not expected to coincide exactly .    in order to see the presence of earth matter effect",
    ", the combination of sk and andes must be able to distinguish , for a given sn model , vacuum from matter event distribution . to illustrate that",
    ", we show in table  [ table : sn - sk - events ] the expected number of events in sk for four different energy bins for vacuum and matter with @xmath46 km , for a variety of sn parameters . if we assume that the shadowed sn neutrino spectra distribution of events at sk can be provided by andes with an uncertainty in each bin equal to the statistical uncertainty in andes we can estimate in which of these cases one can establish the presence of matter effects .",
    "in fact , since the first bin @xmath47 30 mev is not sensitive to matter effects , one can use it as a control bin to evaluate the accuracy of the vacuum distribution provided by andes data . for this study",
    ", we consider sn event at 5 kpc from the earth as we need larger number of events for andes .    to give a quantitative idea of the discrimination power ,",
    "we have assumed , for each sn model in table  [ table : sn - sk - events ] the vacuum distribution to be the hypothesis to be tested with data at 1000 km .",
    "we use the last two energy bins in order to estimate the deviation from vacuum in terms of standard deviations .",
    "these numbers are given in the last column of table  [ table : sn - sk - events ] .",
    "for most cases , matter effects can be established in more than 2 @xmath48 .",
    "we have also verified that if @xmath49 mev we can not distinguish matter effects for any value of the other sn parameters considered in table  [ table : sn - sk - events ] , at least if @xmath50 .",
    "the andes laboratory , if constructed , will be the first deep underground laboratory in the southern hemisphere .",
    "it can offer the possibility to explore rare physics events that can profit from the low natural background environment because of the overburden of @xmath51 kmwe .",
    "in particular , dedicated neutrino physics and dark matter search programs , that could also benefit from the its unique geographic location , could be envisaged .",
    "see @xcite for updates on the status of the laboratory . in this work ,",
    "we have studied the potential of a few kt liquid scintillator neutrino detector at the andes underground laboratory for neutrino astrophysics and geophysics .",
    "since there are very few nuclear reactors in south america , the location of the andes laboratory is specially suitable for geoneutrino observations .",
    "moreover , due to thick continental crust around the laboratory , higher geoneutrino event rate is expected , substantially larger than at kamioka and gran sasso , which by itself would be interesting to confirm experimentally .    concerning the observations of neutrinos coming from sn , the andes neutrino detector could play an important role .",
    "first of all , because of the small event rate of the nearby sn ( within a few 10 kpc from the earth or so ) , having as many large neutrino detectors as possible is highly desirable .",
    "furthermore , because of the location , the presence of the andes detector will increase the chance of observing the earth matter effect by combining the signal at the andes with other detectors in the northern hemisphere .",
    "the andes neutrino detector could also integrate the international sn watch network snews  @xcite .",
    "we have focused here on galactic sn neutrinos and geoneutrinos . however , with such a liquid scintillator detector one could also try to study solar neutrinos in a similar fashion as borexino  @xcite and kamland  @xcite have done and as sno+  @xcite plans to do .",
    "in fact , borexino has shown how pep , cno and perhaps even pp solar neutrinos can be accessible by such a detector .",
    "there is also an interesting proposal to search for indirect dark matter signals through neutrinos which are coming from the dark matter annihilation in the sun in these type of detectors ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "<S> the construction of the agua negra tunnels that will link argentina and chile under the andes , the world longest mountain range , opens the possibility to build the first deep underground laboratory in the southern hemisphere . </S>",
    "<S> this laboratory has the acronym andes ( agua negra deep experiment site ) and its overburden could be as large as @xmath0 km of rock , or 4500 mwe , providing an excellent low background environment to study physics of rare events like the ones induced by neutrinos and/or dark matter . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the physics potential of a few kiloton size liquid scintillator detector , which could be constructed in the andes laboratory as one of its possible scientific programs . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we evaluate the impact of such a detector for the studies of geoneutrinos and galactic supernova neutrinos assuming a fiducial volume of 3 kilotons as a reference size . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize the complementary roles of such a detector to the ones in the northern hemisphere neutrino facilities through some advantages due to its geographical location . </S>"
