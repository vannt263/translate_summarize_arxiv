    ", bell inequalities , which have proven the incompatibility of quantum mechanics with any local realistic theory , have been established as a viable tool for deepening our understanding of the nature of reality and , from a more pragmatic perspective , identify unambiguously correlations of a non - classical nature  @xcite .",
    "non - locality tests for discrete - variable systems have been formulated , over the years , based on both dichotomic and multichotomic local measurement settings  @xcite , showing that bipartite @xmath0-level entangled states are in conflict with local realistic assumptions more strongly than entangled qubits .",
    "inequalities for bipartite @xmath0-dimensional systems have been put forward  @xcite , while various formulation for multipartite @xmath2 systems have been proposed  @xcite , and extended to generic arbitrary dimensional systems  @xcite .",
    "continuous - variable bell - like inequalities have been derived for bipartite states using the phase - space formalism  @xcite , and extended to multipartite scenarios recently  @xcite .",
    "the investigation on non - locality of discrete large-@xmath0 systems is particularly relevant in light of the goal of inferring non - classical effects in increasingly large systems .",
    "the possibility to unambiguously signal non - classical correlations , strong enough to violate a bell - like inequality , would provide undoubtable evidence of the relevance of quantum theory in the large - scale domain , and bring new perspectives to the investigation of the quantum - to - classical transition  @xcite .",
    "first steps along similar lines of investigation have been made by addressing the class of states dubbed as micro - macro ones  @xcite , which have then been extended to macro - macro scenarios  @xcite .",
    "when tackling the phenomenology of non - classical correlations in large - scale systems , the detrimental effects of improper measurements should be considered on the same footing as non - ideal state preparation .",
    "it has been shown that coarse - grained measurements do indeed affect the chances of falsifying local realistic models , even when dealing with otherwise ideal state resources  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a typical assessment of the robustness of bell - like tests is based on the amount of white noise that a given resource state is able to tolerate before losing any discrepancy with local hidden variable ( lhv ) models  @xcite .",
    "this approach was the basis for the conclusion drawn by kaszilowski _",
    "et al . _ on bipartite @xmath0-level systems  @xcite",
    "however , while such analyses provide useful information on the effects that imperfections and environmental mechanisms have on the revelation of non - classicality , a systematic study of the scaling behavior of non - idealities against the _ size _ of a given system has only been partially addressed  @xcite . yet , this is key information for the quest of observing non - classicality at the large - scale limit .",
    "for instance , as we address in this paper , bell inequalities formulated for large-@xmath0 systems require a large number of measurement settings : their inadequate arrangement could have rather significant implications for the successful falsification of lhv models even when states endowed with a large degree of quantum correlations are considered . in this sense",
    ", our study goes well beyond currently available literature  @xcite .",
    "our study here addresses precisely this important issue , which we tackle in a careful quantitative manner . by addressing experimentally relevant imperfections in the bell test of @xmath0-dimensional systems ,",
    "we point out , through a careful statistical analysis , the existence of thresholds in the amount of randomness that a given resource state ( or , equivalently , measurement setting ) can tolerate . as we find out",
    ", such threshold , which scales unfavorably with the dimensions of the local systems being used , is rather severe and poses significant questions on the suitability of bell - like tests in systems verging to the mesoscopic or macroscopic scale , when evaluated against the actual value taken by @xmath0 . in some conditions , even a maximally",
    "entangled two - qutrit state could fail to violate a bell inequality built from slightly improper measurement settings .",

    "in this section we review the formulation of bell inequalities for @xmath0-dimensional systems that are used hereafter .",
    "the original formulation of the bell inequalities relates the joint probabilities for local measurements with two possible outcomes ( @xmath2 ) , typically the polarization of photons or a spin-1/2 system ( dimension @xmath0 and the spin quantum number @xmath3 obey the relation @xmath4 ) .",
    "however , it is possible to extend ( in a non unique way ) such formulation to systems with higher local dimension  @xcite : we consider a coupled bipartite system and two parties ( alice and bob ) each of them having access to a single partition , of dimension @xmath0 , of the system ( either subsystem @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) and able to measure two independent observables , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the operators @xmath11s and @xmath12s are assumed to have the same spectrum , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , with @xmath15 . clearly , for @xmath0-dimensional subsystems the measurement can have @xmath0 different outcomes .",
    "the generalized bell inequalities are obtained summing the probabilities that alice and bob obtain equal ( or correlated ) outcomes of their measurements . in particular , the first bell expression we will consider reads as @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the probability for alice and bob to have the same measure outcomes : @xmath18 and similarly @xmath19 in general , one can show that for local theories only three of the four equalities in ( [ ibell ] ) can be satisfied at the same time , that is for local theories @xmath20 , while non - local theories could reach a value of @xmath21 .    beside the generalization of the standard bell inequality",
    "presented above , we also consider a second inequality , which at variance with the previous one is built with a number of terms that grows with the local dimension of the subsystems .",

    "we have analyzed quantitatively the violation of bell inequalities formulated for general @xmath0-dimensional systems .",
    "our approach , which is oriented towards the provision of information relevant to experimentalists , was based on the careful evaluation of the impact that imperfections in both the state resource and the measurement settings could have on actually violating one of such generalized non - locality tests .",
    "we have found that both bi - local and global imperfections in the arrangements for the measurement settings needed to test a given inequality affect the quality of the corresponding bell test in a system size - dependent fashion .",
    "non - locality in bipartite systems spanning large hilbert spaces is difficult to infer , even when managing maximally entangled states of two spin-@xmath3 particles .",
    "interestingly , we have identified size - dependent thresholds on the amount of noise that the system is able to tolerate before rendering the chance of violating a generalized bell inequality negligibly small .",
    "we have also highlighted the influences due to the statistical sampling used to check the falsification of the bell tests addressed in our work : while a uniform random sampling of the measurement sampling makes it unlikely to single out an instance of violation even for qutrit systems , a more sophisticated statistical sampling reveals that it should be possible to find such instances regardless of the size of the local subsystems , although with increasing efforts being required .",
    "we believe that this work helps addressing the inherent complexity of violating bell inequalities above and beyond the usual studies used to assess their robustness , and provides useful information for any experimental endeavor aimed at testing non - local features in the state of systems spanning large hilbert spaces , a situation that is quickly becoming more realistic and addressable .",
    "furthermore , our work provides for a transparent interpretation of the emergence of classicality in terms of local realism at the macroscopic level : without resorting to decoherence mechanisms , the size - dependent noise thresholds we identified above describe the practical impossibility to detect non - classical behavior in large enough systems via bell inequalities violations . in a word , in the unavoidable presence of noise , large systems",
    "will behave for all practical purposes classically under a bell test .",

    "<S> we address , in particular , the limit of high - dimensional systems , naturally arising when exploring the quantum - to - classical transition . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , although suitable bell inequalities can be violated , in principle , for any dimension of given subsystems , it is in practice increasingly challenging to detect such violations , even if the system is prepared in a maximally entangled state . we characterize the effects of random perturbations on the state or on the measurement settings , also quantifying the efforts needed to certify the possible violations in case of complete ignorance on the system state at hand . </S>"
