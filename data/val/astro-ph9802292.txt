    "its nearness ( @xmath7 pc , mermilliod et al .",
    "@xcite ) and youth ( 120 myr , basri et al .",
    "@xcite ) makes the rapidly cooling bds still rather bright and easy to detect .",
    "the first bona fide pleiades bd was reported by rebolo et al .",
    "this object , known as teide1 , passed the lithium test @xcite and should thereby have a maximum mass of 0.06 m@xmath6 . by now , on the order of 10 bds have been confirmed in the pleiades .",
    "the present observations were designed to probe low - mass bds in the pleiades and to provide accurate first - epoch data for future proper motion determination .",
    "this paper is an extension of the @xmath8 survey described in festin @xcite .",
    "for a teide1-type object , the flux rises from 10 to almost 100% of its peak value between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , although providing a rather short wavelength baseline , @xmath11 was chosen as the primary temperature indicator .",
    "its efficiency is proved by the large gap between the pleiades sequence and the background stars in the @xmath9 vs @xmath11 diagram .",
    "most observational effort was spent on obtaining high - quality images in @xmath9 ( fig .",
    "[ figseeing ] ) to get good first - epoch coordinates and to clean out galaxies . to minimize the effects of nonuniform pixels and rotation angle , each @xmath9 field",
    "was observed at four different field angles ( 0 , 90 , 180 and 270 degrees ) .",
    "complementary photometry was taken in @xmath12 .",
    "+    all observations were carried out at the 2.5 m nordic optical telescope ( not ) , la palma .",
    "the survey covers 648 arcmin@xmath0 in @xmath13 ( of which 240 arcmin@xmath0 were also covered in @xmath14 ) + 200 arcmin@xmath0 in @xmath15 only .",
    "the total area is 848 arcmin@xmath0 near the centre of the pleiades ( fig .",
    "[ figfield ] ) .",
    "a summary of the observations is given in table  [ tabobsoverview ] .",
    ".observations [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     figure  [ figimf ] suggests a rising mf towards lower masses with a power - law index between 0 and 1 , but there are several uncertainties one should be aware of .",
    "the observed number of objects is small , but it remains clear that the lf drops from @xmath16 to the survey limit .",
    "we can not say how many pleiades bds that are lost in unresolved binaries .",
    "however , we estimate a likely upper limit by assuming that the 30% multiple fraction for m dwarfs @xcite applies to all our single pleiades candidates which are brighter than the bd limit at @xmath17 . if those companions all are below the bd limit , 8 bds would have been lost . of course",
    ", we do not know their possible distribution , but adding 8 bds to the lf still leaves it close to the @xmath18 curve . from this crude discussion it follows that lost companions are unlikely to raise the mf index significantly above 1 .",
    "there is also a normalization error , which does not affect the falling trend , however .",
    "the model in baraffe et al .",
    "@xcite is state - of - the - art and based on the latest generation of non - grey atmospheres and should provide the best possible mass - luminosity relations for the pleiades bd sequence .",
    "since it has not yet been possible to derive an empirical mass - luminosity relation for substellar objects , we do not try to estimate the uncertainties in mass that may arise from the model .",
    "we have performed a deep 850 arcmin@xmath0 @xmath1 survey in the central area of the pleiades cluster .",
    "photometry in @xmath9 , @xmath10 or @xmath14 is presented for 32 previously known and 7 new likely members .",
    "four of those are below the bd limit , and the faintest one would be the lowest mass bd found in the pleiades so far , if its membership could be confirmed .",
    "the overall agreement in the photometry with other surveys is satisfactory .",
    "teide1 is an exception .",
    "we find @xmath19 , @xmath200.5 mag fainter than zrm . based on rgo archive data and a roughly constant @xmath10 magnitude",
    "we conclude that the reason for this discrepancy most likely sits in the photometry of zrm and not in intrinsic variability .      after splitting ppl15 and two other probable binaries into components ,",
    "the pleiades lf was compared to model lfs derived from the most recent theoretical mass - luminosity relations .",
    "the observed lf supports an mf - index between 0 and 1 .",
    "thus , even if the mf seems to rise for low - mass bds in the pleiades , it is not steep enough to leave more than a few percent of the cluster s mass in bds , which is consistent with dynamical findings @xcite .",
    "i would like to thank the not opc for allocating time for this project which is an essential part in my coming thesis .",
    "thanks also to n.c .",
