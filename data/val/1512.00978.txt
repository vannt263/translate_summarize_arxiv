    "one of the reasons is that a cold atom system opens a way to study the physical properties of a gas of fermionic atoms with half - integer spin @xmath8 , thereby enabling the study of novel impurity problems .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to develop this general idea into an experimental and theoretical framework wherein the coqblin - schrieffer model can be realized in an atomic gas of cold @xmath0yb atoms .    in the `` traditional '' kondo effect @xcite , a magnetic impurity of spin @xmath9 immersed in a metal host , scatters the itinerant electrons having spin @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) through an antiferromagnetic exchange interaction @xmath12 with @xmath13 , and the pertinent dynamics",
    "is governed by the @xmath14-@xmath15 exchange hamiltonian @xcite . in the coqblin - schrieffer model @xcite , the itinerant fermions and the impurity are both @xmath16-fold `` spin '' degenerate , so that the corresponding hamiltonian has an su(@xmath16 ) symmetry . the main difference between the s - d exchange model for spin @xmath17 and the coqblin - schrieffer model for `` spin ''",
    "@xmath18 is that , due to exchange scattering , the change of the @xmath19-component of the angular momentum of the impurity is restricted to @xmath20 in the s - d model , while it is unrestricted in the coqblin - schrieffer model . in solid state physics , the high level degeneracy is due to spin - orbit coupling , so that the model is relevant for applications to rare earth impurities . in a gas of ultracold atoms ,",
    "the degeneracy is due solely to the atomic total angular momentum @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the nuclear spin and @xmath23 is the total ( orbital and spin ) electronic angular momentum .    realizing the coqblin - schrieffer model in cold fermionic @xmath0yb atoms is feasible due to a rather unique exchange mechanism .",
    "the atoms in the @xmath1s@xmath2 ground - state form a fermi gas with su(@xmath16 ) symmetry and the atoms in the long - lived @xmath3p@xmath2 excited state assume the role of localized magnetic impurities .",
    "both the ground and excited states have spin @xmath24 ( which is the nuclear spin ) .",

    "requires a detailed knowledge of the atomic wave functions .",
    "although these details are of technical nature , they expose how the exchange interaction determines the scattering length , and demonstrate the extreme sensitivity of the relation between the singlet and triplet scattering lengths on the one hand and the magnitude of the exchange interaction on the other hand . in subsection [ append - basic - wf ] we discuss statistics of two atoms and two ions",

    "recent advance in the techniques of cooling and manipulating degenerate alkaline - earth - like atoms ( e.g. ytterbium and/or strontium atoms ) @xcite paves the way for studying novel aspects of interacting fermi systems .",
    "these include non - equilibrium properties such as transport , as well as impurity problems and other facets of quantum magnetism . a key role in these considerations is played by the interplay between the long - lived metastable @xmath3p@xmath2 state and the @xmath1s@xmath2 ground state , with their enlarged su(@xmath16 ) spin symmetry for fermionic isotopes  @xcite .",
    "utilizing a narrow singlet - triplet optical transition , for example , alkaline - earth - like atoms have been thought of as a promising candidate for realizing a precise atomic clock  @xcite or ideal storage of qubits for the application of quantum computing  @xcite .",
    "here we consider the possible occurrence of the kondo effect and its su(@xmath16 ) extensions in a gas of ytterbium atoms .",
    "making use of different ac polarizabilities of the ground - state ( @xmath1s@xmath2 ) and the long lived metastable ( @xmath3p@xmath2 ) state , the localized @xmath3p@xmath2 atoms can serve as magnetic impurities which interact with itinerant ground - state atoms  @xcite .",
    "the kondo effect arises when this interaction is characterized by spin - exchange between @xmath1s@xmath2 and @xmath3p@xmath2 state .",
    "such spin - exchange interactions has recently been demonstrated@xcite in fermionic @xmath0yb atoms .",
    "realizing the kondo effect in alkali - earth - like atoms exposes novel aspects of the kondo physics with su(@xmath16 ) symmetric interactions that are difficult to elucidate in solid - state based system , because the high su(@xmath16 ) symmetry arises from the strong decoupling between nuclear and electronic spins in alkali - earth - like atoms .",
    "as such , it has attracted much interest in the context of su(@xmath16 ) fermi gases both for bulk systems  @xcite and for lattice systems  @xcite . here , we focus on the su(@xmath16 ) kondo model in the fermionic @xmath0yb gas , and estimate the kondo temperature . in cold atom systems , due to the weak magnetic coupling of spin - exchange interactions , the questions still remains whether or not the kondo temperature is attainable by current experiments .",
    "our finding shows that the kondo temperature is enhanced by the su(@xmath16 ) interactions . in electronic systems , this is shown in previous works on heavy fermion systems @xcite and on carbon nanotube quantum dots @xcite .",
    "indeed , the kondo temperature in cold atom system may also be enhanced by means of the confinement - induced resonance  @xcite or by the orbital - induced feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "having underlined the peculiar advantage of using alkaline atoms to explore the kondo effect and its su(@xmath16 ) extensions , we now focus a cold gas of @xmath0yb fermionic atoms confined in a shallow harmonic potential .",
    "most of the atoms remain in the ground state @xmath26s@xmath27 and form a fermi sea due to its half integer nuclear spin @xmath28 ( purple area in fig . [ fig - model ] ) .",

    "[ fig - model ] ( red circles ) , and can be regarded as localized impurities .",
    "the wavelength of the periodic optical potential exceeds the range of interaction between atoms , thereby justifying the assumption that the concentration of excited atoms is small enough so that they are not correlated .",

    "the details of an exchange interaction between an atom in the ground - state and an atom in an excited state is of crucial importance .",
    "since both atoms in the ground and excited states are in an electronic singlet state , direct exchange interaction between these atoms is absent .",
    "there is , however , an indirect exchange , that involves virtual hopping of electrons between the atoms such that an atom transforms from the ground state to an excited state , whereas the other atom transforms from an excited state to the ground state .",
    "an expression for this exchange interaction is derived below , followed by an analysis of the corresponding impurity problem , that turns out to be a manifestation of the coqblin - schrieffer model realized in cold atom systems .      before discussing exchange interaction between two yb atoms",
    "it is important to analize the single atom properties because the exchange interaction is crucially dependent on the electronic wave functions of a single atom .",

    "the potential parameters are tuned such that @xmath46 and therefore the atoms in the ground state are considered as itinerant atoms , and the atom in the excited state plays a role of the impurity .    in the adiabatic ( born - oppenheimer ) approximation ( which is well substantiated in atomic physics ) , the wave function of a single ytterbium atom is expressed as a product of the wave functions @xmath47 ( for the rigid ion core ) and @xmath48 ( for the valence electrons ) .",
    "the former is considered as a point particle of mass @xmath49 whose position vector in cartesian coordinates is @xmath50 .    starting with the core wave functions ,",
    "recall that the atoms in the ground - state and the excited state are subject to different 3d optical potentials and van der waals interactions between the atoms .",
    "strictly speaking , we should describe the system by many - particle wave function @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the number of itinerant atoms , @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the position of an itinerant atom ( @xmath55 ) and @xmath56 is the position of the impurity atom .",
    "when the distance between all the atoms exceeds the range of the vad der waals interaction , the many - particle wave function splits into a product of single - particle wave functions .",
