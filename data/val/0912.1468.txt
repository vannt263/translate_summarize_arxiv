    "among the `` unusual '' manifestations observed in the quantum world , entanglement is undoubtedly one of the most interesting ones .",
    "entanglement corresponds to global states of two or more quantum systems that can not be separated into direct product states of individual subsystems .",
    "this characteristic yields correlations between quantum systems that can not be found in any classical system @xcite .",
    "moreover , entanglement is a very important ingredient for quantum computer s architecture @xcite and quantum communication @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that some tasks executed by a quantum computer can be performed exponentially faster than by the existing computers .",
    "these potential applications of a quantum computer have motivated a large number of experimentalists and different approaches have been used to build entangled states in laboratories @xcite . despite the successful experimental achievements , there are many difficulties to overcome before a functional quantum computer becomes a reality .",
    "one of the most trivial difficulties is the fact that the usual quantum systems candidates for qubits ( see below ) are intrinsically open to their environments and therefore suffer their effects by losing coherence .",
    "thus , pure quantum states become mixed states under the environment s influence . fortunately",
    ", it has been demonstrated that computers based on mixed states can also be used to solve certain tasks more efficiently than classical computers @xcite , although they are less powerful than the computation using pure states .",
    "the reason for such a performance is attributed to correlations not presented in classical systems . these quantum correlations ( qcs ) can be identified through a quantity called quantum discord @xcite .",
    "recently , the interest on this subject has received great attention due to the possibility of achieving quantum computation without entangled states @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "many different aspects of quantum discord have been discussed , _",
    "e.g. _ , robustness to quantum sudden death @xcite , relation to the speed - up in deterministic quantum computation with one qubit @xcite , the interplay between quantum phase transitions and quantum discord @xcite , and the condition to obtain completely positive maps @xcite .",
    "there are many different systems proposed as candidates for qubits . among them , double quantum dots ( dqds ) ( see fig .  [ fig0 ] ) are very interesting due to the easy integration with existing electronics and the advantage of scalability @xcite .",
    "moreover , arrays of quantum dots can be employed to perform logical operations , which can be used to implement an universal quantum computation based on quantum @xcite and classical effects @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we investigate the quantum correlation dynamics of two dqds including the basic elements to simulate a realistic situation , _",
    "e.g. _ , finite temperatures , interaction between qubits , and detuning .",
    "we also compare the effects of dissipation on the behavior of the quantum discord ( qd ) with that of the entanglement of formation ( eof ) @xcite .",
    "our results show the longer duration of qd against the eof .",
    "to explain such a result , we analyze how the environment acts on the system by comparing the case where the bath is coupled to both dqds , which is the more realistic case , to the case where each dqd is coupled to its own bath . based on this comparison , we verify that the common character of the bath might be very important to prolong the qd .",
    "in fact , this character of the environment brings different properties to the dissipative dynamics .",
    "contrary to the case of independent environments , by which the coherences are completely lost , we can find regions of the state space where the coherences are preserved @xcite .",
    "we observe that this robustness can be transferred to the quantum discord .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we describe the basic concepts of quantum discord . in sect .",
    "iii we present the hamiltonian of the system and the master equation which accounts for the interaction between the system and the environment . in sect .",
    "iv , we discuss the obtained results for the quantum correlations of two coupled dqds .",
    "finally , we summarize our work in sect .  v.",
    "quantum discord has been proposed as a quantity that captures the quantum correlations between two subsystems @xcite . to evaluate such qcs , one needs to subtract the classical correlations from the total correlation @xcite .",
    "the total correlation of a bipartite quantum systems , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , is calculated by the quantum mutual information @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the von neumann entropy of the density matrix @xmath5 . here",
    ", we adopt the following definitions : @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the bipartite density matrix .    to calculate the classical correlations we observe that the projective measurements on a subsystem remove all nonclassical correlations between the parts , _",
    "i.e. _ , after a measurement on a particular subsystem , all qcs are destroyed .",
    "thus , we define a quantity that evaluates the mutual information after a measurement on one of the subsystems @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the system conditional entropy after the measurement and @xmath12 defines a complete set of one - dimensional projectors , and the different outcomes of this measurement are accounted for by @xmath13 . to quantify the quantum correlations , since @xmath14 depends on the projector basis @xmath12 , we take the maximum of @xmath14 taking into account all possible projectors .",
    "thus , we can define the following quantity , @xmath15 that gives a measure of the total classical correlations between two subsystems @xcite .",
    "therefore , the qd can be written as : @xmath16 it is straightforward to observe that if all information can be obtained locally by @xmath1 , this subsystem has qd equals to zero .",
    "this implies that a measurement on @xmath1 does not alter the state of @xmath0 .",
    "otherwise , if just part of the information can be obtained locally , @xmath1 is quantum correlated to @xmath0 .",
    "the qd thus gives the total information that is not locally accessible and has been accepted as a measure of the quantum correlation . besides , the qd is possibly finite even for separable quantum states and can be utilized as a new resource for quantum computation @xcite .",
    "also , when only pure states are considered , qd and the entanglement of formation @xcite are indistinguishable .",
    "in order to analyze the two dqds dynamics in an open quantum system , we suppose that both qubits are coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators ( phonons ) .",
    "the total hamiltonian that computes the environment perturbation is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 with @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the frequency of the @xmath31 normal mode of the bath , and @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath33 is the usual annihilation operator of this mode and @xmath34 is its complex coupling constant with the dqds .",
    "it is important to note that the interaction hamiltonian acts in a correlated way with both qubits , thereby representing a common bath . to numerically determine the evolution of the two dqds reduced density matrix , we employ the redfield master equation @xcite @xmath35\\right]}\\right\\},\\label{master}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the interaction hamiltonian in the interaction picture , @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39",

    ", we notice that the exponential behavior of qd decays faster than eof .     and a common bath with @xmath134 and @xmath103 . in the inset we plot the eof curve and the qd curve minus the long time saturation value to extract only its exponential behavior .",
    "]    based on our results , we conclude that the quantum correlation dynamics of the two dqds can be summarized as follows : the coulomb interaction introduces the correlations between both dqds and the environment acts in a way to preserve these correlations for a longer time . despite the fact that the entanglement decays exponentially to zero ,",
    "the qd is sustained depending on the way the dqds are coupled to the environment .",
    "we have numerically solved the redfield master equation to study the quantum correlation dynamics of two dqds at finite temperatures including the interaction between the qubits and detuning .",
    "we have verified that dissipation in this system has an impact on the eof which is stronger than on the qd , thereby causing a shorter duration of the eof .",
    "we have shown that the qd is not completely destroyed through the interaction with the environment and that it remains stable even at finite temperatures .",
    "to explain these facts , we have explored the characteristics of the bath , _",
    "i.e. _ , whether both qubits are coupled simultaneously to a single bath or each qubit is coupled to its own bath .",
    "the results have shown that even though the coupling between the two - qubits is zero , the quantum correlations survive for longer periods in the case of a common bath .",
    "this behavior results from the particular form of the interaction hamiltonian and there are systems for which the robustness of qd may not occur and each different case must be analyzed carefully . as a final comment , it should be desirable to study the same effects in the context of the dynamics of a couple of brownian particles in a common bath which has recently been analyzed in @xcite and where it has been shown that the reservoir mediates an effective coupling between the particles .",
    "the alternative ( and more general ) coupling to the environment used in this problem could also be applied to the present model aiming at a possible maintenance of the quantum correlations between the qubits for a much longer time interval .",
