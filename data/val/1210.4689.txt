    "the investigation of the nucleon structure through electromagnetic ( em ) probes has played a central role in our present understanding of strong interactions . in particular , the measurements of em nucleon form factors ( ff s ) in the spacelike ( sl ) region , which started with the pioneering work of hofstadter @xcite , have given the indisputable evidence of the non - elementary nature of the proton .",
    "the possibility , offered by sl photons , of achieving an accurate description of the three - dimensional structure of the nucleon has motivated many and successful experimental efforts , which resulted in an accurate data base of the sl nucleon ff s ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a list of recent reviews ) . with the advent of a new experimental technique ",
    "the so - called polarization - transfer method  a striking fall - off of the proton electric ff relative to the magnetic one , which largely follows a dipole behavior , has been discovered .",
    "this relatively recent achievement impressively demonstrates the relevance of the polarization degrees of freedom in the studies of the nucleon structure .",
    "the transition to the timelike ( tl ) region , widening in such a way the investigation of the nucleon ff s , opens unique possibilities for studying peculiar features of the nucleon state .",
    "in particular , in the tl region , one can exploit the hadronic components of the virtual photon state , that become physical , according to the proper energy thresholds .",
    "a very popular model of those hadronic components is the vector meson dominance model ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) , that allows i ) to develop a simple picture of the production mechanism of a physical hadron - antihadron pair , and ii ) to accurately identify quantities , which are containing relevant details on the nucleon / antinucleon states .",
    "the information accessed in the tl region could appear less intuitive than the electric and magnetic distribution densities of the nucleon , but indeed they play a relevant role for shedding light on the long - range behavior of the strong interactions . tl ff s",
    "are indeed more sensitive to the discrete hadron spectrum ( given the pole structure that occurs ) and to the presence of many transition amplitudes of physical processes .",
    "for instance , though the sl nucleon ff s can be described by models , that take into account only few vector mesons , the pole pattern shown by the experimental tl ff s can not be reproduced without considering _ all _ the relevant vector mesons . to better understand the appealing feature of the tl region , let us go back to the fifties , when the theoretical studies on this issue began .",
    "in particular , in a paper by federbush , goldberger and treiman @xcite , it was pointed out that a bridge can be established between the studies of the nucleon em ff s and the transition amplitudes of physical processes , like em decays of vector mesons ( vm s ) as well as the production of hadronic states with well - defined quantum numbers .",
    "this link was found through the dispersion relations that allow to express the ff s in terms of an integral over their imaginary parts , that are non - vanishing only in the tl region . at that time , the mesonic and nucleonic degrees of freedom were the relevant ones in the field of the strong interactions , and therefore the mentioned em vm decays and hadronic transition amplitudes were considered as the relevant inputs for a phenomenological analysis .",
    "our modern paradigm of strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , allows us to understand those physical quantities , through a microscopical description in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "it should be noticed that microscopic models could represent an effective tool for evaluating the above mentioned quantities ( see , e.g. , the analyses in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , since lattice qcd is greatly challenged in the tl region , differently from the sl case where electric and magnetic density distributions begin to be addressed  @xcite .",
    "summarizing what has been illustrated above , it is clear that a measurement of the imaginary part of the tl nucleon ff s , that can be achieved by exploiting the polarization degrees of freedom , is highly desirable , with a final goal of constructing a more detailed database of the nucleon ff s , that does contain not only information on the electric and magnetic distribution densities , but also on other physical hadronic processes .    at present , the experimental knowledge of the tl nucleon ff s unfortunately does not yet allow to achieve this goal . compared to the sl sector , where precision measurements of ff s have been achieved on the percent level , the data base of tl ff s is rather scarce .",
    "recent measurements of the babar collaboration  @xcite have somewhat improved the knowledge of the proton ff .",
    "the babar result concerning the ratio of the electric to the magnetic ff is however still largely limited by statistical uncertainties , and it is furthermore in conflict with a previous measurement at lear  @xcite .",
    "this only demonstrates the need for a new generation of high - precision measurements of the em ff of the proton and neutron .",
    "indeed , new facilities at novosibirsk , beijing , and fair / darmstadt recently came into operation or are about to start in the coming years . from these facilities",
    "we can expect significantly improved results .",
    "the aim of the work is therefore to give an updated ( maybe not complete ) view to the present status of both the experimental and theoretical investigations in the field .",
    "moreover , we hope that this review could represent an opportunity , allowing to share the common expertise , and to compare the different experimental as well as theoretical techniques , which have been worked out in the past .",
    "but , after all , the main goal is to show the wealth of information which is provided by the tl nucleon ff s for understanding in depth the non - perturbative regime of qcd . in view of this , we will emphasize that only measurements of the relative phases will fully determine the nucleon ff s in the tl region , so that the maximal phenomenological knowledge can be reached .",
    "therefore , this review appears to be timely , given the near- and mid - term future experimental programs .",

    "then , the hermiticity of @xmath256 follows from the hermiticity of @xmath257 .",
    "it is important to anticipate that , in the tl region , the unitarity constraint has to be implemented by taking into account the opening of real - particle production channels , since a @xmath258-channel reaction occurs .",
    "therefore , the tl nucleon ff s are expected to be complex functions .    instead of using dirac and pauli ff s ,",

    "( [ sachs ] ) , @xmath261 and @xmath262 are the so - called sachs electric and magnetic form factors , respectively .",
    "the physical motivation of considering these combinations is given by the analysis of the current operator performed in the breit frame , where @xmath263 and @xmath264 . in this frame , the nucleon ff s can be expressed in terms of three - dimensional fourier transforms of functions to be interpreted as electric and magnetic densities , like in the non relativistic framework , viz _ e ( m)^n(|*r*| ) = e^-i * q * m_ne(|*q*| ) g_e ( m)^n(|*q*|^2 ) .",
    "[ density ] where @xmath265 . if @xmath266 , the non - relativistic limit is immediately recovered .",
    "therefore , one could naively argue that the sl nucleon ff s yield information on intrinsic properties of the nucleon .",
    "unfortunately , such a correlation should be carefully reconsidered , taking properly into account the boosts to be applied to the states of a composite system , like the nucleon ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "notice that , in the breit frame , both initial and final states have to be boosted when the matrix elements of the current are calculated .",
    "recently , a new physical interpretation of the nucleon ff s has emerged ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it is based on the field theoretical description of the constituents , inside the nucleon , given in terms of the so - called generalized parton distributions ( gpd s ) ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for an extended review of the topic ) .",
    "such a formalism , developed within the deep inelastic virtual compton framework , leads to a description that fully satisfies the general principles , allowing to correctly treat the relativistic - boost effects , as well .",
    "it should be pointed out that gpd s depend upon three scalar invariants : @xmath267 $ ] , @xmath268 $ ] and @xmath269 , with i ) @xmath87 the average four momentum of the active constituent , before and after interacting with an external probe , and ii ) @xmath270 a light - like four - vector .",
    "furthermore , it turns out that , in the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) limit where the variable @xmath271 plays an analogous role of @xmath272 , one can reobtain the nucleon ff s from the unpolarized quark gpd s , putting @xmath273 and integrating on @xmath274 . to complete the analysis , two - dimensional fourier transforms of the relevant gpd s in the drell - yan frame ( a particular breit frame where the @xmath275 ) are introduced . in this frame , the variable @xmath276 has only transverse components , i.e. @xmath277 , ( notice that in the drell - yan frame @xmath278 ) and it is conjugated to the impact parameter @xmath279 . in conclusion ,",
    "the main outcome is given by the determination of well - defined density distributions of the constituents in the transverse plane @xmath280 .",
    "for instance , the dirac ff yields _ 1^n(|*b*_|)=   e^i**b * * _ _   _ -1 ^ 1 dx  h^n(x,0,_)= =   e^i**b * * _ _  f_1^n(q^2=|*q*_|^2 ) [ rhogpd ] where @xmath281 is one of the unpolarized gpd s . summarizing , @xmath243 can provide information on the density distributions in a transverse plane , once the effect of the boosts on the initial and final states of a composite system are correctly taken into account .",
    "this can be implemented by using the light - cone description of both the operator current and the nucleon states ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the last issue to be mentioned , that will be relevant also in the tl region when a model builder has to constrain his own approach , is the asymptotic behavior of the nucleon ff s , as dictated by qcd . by considering both dimensional scaling laws and helicity conservation , perturbative qcd ( pqcd )",
    "yields the following asymptotic behavior for the nucleon ff s ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) f_i^n(q^2)^i+1  ^-i=1,2 [ pqcd ] where @xmath282 is the anomalous dimension ( @xmath283 , depending upon the active number of flavors @xmath284 ) .",
    "it should be pointed that the asymptotic behavior of the ff s is dictated by the perturbative gluon exchange , that provides the mechanism for sharing the momentum transfer among the constituents . in order to accomplish this ,",
    "at least two massless gluons must be exchanged , and each gluon propagator contributes with a factor @xmath285 . as to @xmath244 , the spin - flip effect adds an extra factor @xmath285 .    to complete this snapshot of the sl region , it is impossible to avoid few words on the experimental technique that has given a new , strong impetus to the investigation of the proton ff s in this region . in particular ,",
    "a technique based on the measurement of the polarization of the final state proton has experimentally proven that the proton charge ff strikingly decreases faster than the dipole ff  @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noting that in the tl region , since the nucleon ff s become complex functions , a @xmath31 pair , produced in the final state , naturally acquires polarization degrees of freedom , even in absence of polarized leptons in the initial state ( see subsect .",

    ", one should first recall that the polarization of a fermion ( with four - momentum @xmath246 and spin @xmath258 ) with respect to a given direction , @xmath288 , is obtained from the following expectation value : = 1u^(p , s ) u(p , s ) u^(p , s ) (     c c & 0 + 0 &    ) u(p , s ) = 1 |u(p , s ) ^0 u(p , s )   |u(p , s ) _",
