    "the kicked rotor model is a paradigm of periodically driven systems with classical chaotic behavior and its quantum version , the quantum kicked rotor ( qkr ) , can be considered a cornerstone in the study of chaos at the quantum level @xcite .",
    "this topic is a matter of permanent attention , both theoretical and experimental , for example it has been recently reported @xcite the experimental realization of the quantum kicked top ( a variant of the qkr . ) to study signatures of quantum chaos .",
    "the behavior of the qkr has two characteristic modalities : dynamical localization and ballistic spreading of the variance in resonance @xcite .",
    "these behaviors are quite different and have no classical analog .",
    "they depend on the relationship between the characteristic time of the free rotor and the period associated to the kick .",
    "when the dimensionless period of the kick , @xmath0 , is an irrational multiple of @xmath1 the average energy of the system grows in a diffusive manner for a short time and afterwards dynamical localization appears . in this case , the angular momentum distribution has a maximum at its mean value and decays exponentially . for @xmath0 rational multiple of @xmath1",
    "the behavior of the system is resonant with ballistic spreading , and the angular momentum distribution evolves from the initial one in such away that its standard deviation has the time dependence @xmath2 .",
    "the two types of values of @xmath0 determine the spectral properties of the hamiltonian , for irrational multiples the energy spectrum is purely discrete and for rational multiples it contains a continuous part . both quantum resonance and dynamical localization can be seen as interference phenomena , the first being a constructive interference effect and the second a destructive one .",
    "different variants of the qkr have been studied , but with the aim of this work in mind , it is interesting to highlight the one developed by @xcite where the qkr is subjected to two unitary operators with two different values of the strength parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the dynamics of the qkr kicked according to a fibonacci sequence is studied in ref .",
    "this is done outside the resonant regime , where a sub - diffusive behavior is found for small kicking strengths . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have also studied the qkr excited with the same fibonacci prescription but in the resonant regime .",
    "it was shown that the standard deviation of the primary resonances maintains the well - known ballistic behavior but the secondary resonances have sub - ballistic behavior , characterized by the time dependence of its standard deviation @xmath4 , with @xmath5 .",
    "this change of behavior is similar to that obtained for the quantum walk ( qw ) subjected to an aperiodic fibonacci excitation @xcite where the ballistic behavior is lost and the sub - ballistic behavior appears .",
    "we have also investigated the qkr in resonance subjected to decoherence : a ) with a lvy waiting - time distribution @xcite and b ) with an unitary noise defined through kraus operators @xcite . in both cases",
    "we find that the secondary resonances have a sub - ballistic behavior , while the principal resonances are not affected . on the other hand , in refs .",
    "@xcite the qkr subjected to noises with a lvy distribution out of resonance was investigated , showing that the decoherence leads to a sub - diffusive regime ( @xmath6 ) for a short time before localization appears .",
    "the quantum resonances and the dynamical localization have been experimentally observed in refs .",
    "the qkr was experimentally realized through a dilute sample of ultra - cold atoms exposed to a one - dimensional spatially periodic optical potential that is pulsed on periodically in time ( to approximate a series of delta function kicks ) .",
    "however , the ballistic growth of the secondary resonances was not confirmed .",
    "it was found that the momentum distribution profiles saturated to a final distribution but different from the characteristic exponential profiles of the dynamical localization . in ref .",
    "@xcite the usual qkr is modified , by adding other elements such as a quasi - momentum , in order to explain the absence of the ballistic growth .",
    "however later experiments @xcite has confirmed this growth .    in a recent paper @xcite we have studied the qw model using a time - dependent unitary coin operator .",
    "we found different types of anomalous diffusion depending on the time prescription for the coin operator . in the same line of thought , in this paper",
    "we develop a simple qkr model with a generalized time strength parameter @xmath7 that allows an analytical treatment of the primary resonances .",
    "we study the connection between the time evolution of @xmath7 and the type of spreading of the system .",
    "we analytically show how to select the time dependence of @xmath7 to obtain a predetermined power - law distribution of the standard deviation .",
    "we propose this toy model to reproduce the experimental behavior reported in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we present a brief revision of the qkr equations , in the third section we obtain analytically the standard deviation for the primary resonances , in section @xmath8 we choose a time dependence for @xmath7 , in section @xmath9 numerical results are presented for the secondary resonances , and in the last section we draw the conclusions .",
    "the qkr is one of the simplest and best investigated quantum models whose classical counterpart displays chaos . in this paper",

    "the system does not spread when @xmath63 , it becomes localized in angular momentum .",
    "we have called this behavior ` bessel - localized ' because the distribution decay is slower than the case of exponential localization , as can be seen from eq.([prob1 ] ) .",

    "when @xmath73 the standard deviation spreads out as @xmath74 , but the probability distribution @xmath71 is not gaussian .",
    "this confirms that the evolution corresponds to a coherent unitary process and not to the classical diffusive behavior . in the extreme case when @xmath75 the distribution is restricted to a small interval around its initial value and",

    "it is important to point out that the distribution profiles presented here are qualitatively similar to those obtained in ref .",

    "on the other hand , the experimental set up described in the previous references could be used for the realization of the qkr proposed in this work . the most important difference with the realized experiments",
    "would reside in that the intensity of the laser that hits the cloud of atoms should depend on time .    in summary , we have developed a variant of the qkr model that shows anomalous diffusion in resonances .",
