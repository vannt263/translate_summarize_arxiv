    "in the standard picture of elementary particle physics , the electroweak gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken by introducing an iso - doublet scalar field , the higgs field . its neutral component receives the vacuum expectation value .",
    "consequently , the gauge bosons and the matter fields obtain their masses through the couplings with the higgs scalar field .",
    "identification of the higgs boson is one of the most important goals of high energy collider experiments .",
    "the fit by lep electroweak working group favors a relatively light higgs boson with its mass below 251 gev , assuming the standard model ( sm)@xcite . the search for the higgs bosons is being carried at fermilab tevatron and will be continued at cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "there the sm higgs boson is expected to be discovered as long as its mass is less than 1 tev . in order to verify the mechanism of mass generation ,",
    "the higgs boson couplings with gauge bosons as well as fermions have to be determined with sufficient accuracy . moreover , precise determination of the self - coupling constant of the higgs boson is essential to determine the structure of the higgs potential .",
    "an electron - positron ( @xmath9 ) linear collider ( lc ) , such as glc@xcite , tesla@xcite or nlc@xcite and its photon - photon ( @xmath10-@xmath10 ) collider option , can provide an opportunity for the precise measurement of the higgs boson couplings . at lc s , the higgs boson ( @xmath0 )",
    "is produced mainly via the higgsstrahlung process @xmath11 for relatively low energies and also via the fusion process @xmath12 for higher energies@xcite . in both production mechanisms ,",
    "the higgs boson is produced through the coupling with weak gauge bosons .",
    "the cross sections are expected to be measured at a percent level or better unless the higgs boson is relatively heavy .",
    "the higgs boson couplings with heavy quarks ( except the top quark ) and the tau lepton can be tested by measuring the decay branching ratios of the higgs boson .",
    "furthermore , the tri - linear coupling of the higgs boson @xmath2@xcite and the top - yukawa coupling @xmath13 can be determined by measuring the cross section of double higgs production processes@xcite @xmath14 as well as @xmath15 and the top - associated higgs production process@xcite @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath17 option of the lc can also be useful for the higgs self - coupling measurement@xcite .",
    "studying the higgs sector is not only useful for the confirmation of the breaking mechanism of the electroweak gauge symmetry , but also provides a sensitive window for new physics beyond the sm .",
    "in fact , in many models of new physics an extended higgs sector appears as the low energy effective theory , which has discriminative phenomenological properties .",
    "one popular example is known to be the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm)@xcite , in which the higgs sector is a two higgs doublet model ( thdm ) .",
    "some models of the dynamical breaking of the electroweak symmetry also induce more than one higgs doublets in their low energy effective theories@xcite .",
    "there are other motivations to introduce extra higgs fields , such as electroweak baryogenesis@xcite , top - bottom mass hierarchy@xcite , and neutrino mass problem@xcite .",
    "a common feature of extended higgs sectors is the existence of additional scalar bosons , such as charged higgs bosons and cp - odd higgs boson(s ) .",
    "after the discovery of the lightest higgs boson , direct search of these extra scalar particles would become important to distinguish new physics models from the sm . even if the extra higgs bosons are not found , we can still obtain insight by looking for indirect effects of the extra higgs boson from the precise determination of the lightest higgs boson properties@xcite .",
    "for example , the mass , width , production cross sections and decay branching ratios of the lightest higgs boson should be thoroughly measured to test whether or not these data are consistent with the sm .",
    "the existence of extra higgs bosons can affect the observables associated with the lightest higgs boson through both the tree level mixing effect and the quantum loop effect . in this way",

    ", we evaluate the higgs coupling with the gauge boson @xmath1 and the higgs self - coupling @xmath2 at one loop level in the thdm , in order to study the impact of the extra higgs bosons on the coupling associated with the lightest higgs boson ( @xmath0 ) . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the one loop contributions of additional higgs bosons and heavy quarks to the @xmath2 coupling are discussed in the limit where only @xmath0 is responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking ( in the sm - like limit ) . the calculation has been done both in the effective potential method and in the diagrammatic method , but details of the calculation were not shown . in the present paper , we will show the details of our calculation , in which the on - shell renormalization scheme@xcite is adopted .",

    "when the heavy higgs boson mass is predominantly generated by @xmath18 , contributions in powers of the mass of the loop particles can appear in the one loop effect couplings of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "they are quadratic for the @xmath20 coupling and quartic for the @xmath2 coupling@xcite . in this case",
    ", relatively large quantum correction is expected in the @xmath2 vertex , especially when the particle in the loop is heavy .",

    "these observables can receive large quantum corrections due to the non - decoupling effects . on the contrary ,",
    "when the heavy higgs bosons obtain their masses mainly from the other source , such power - like contribution disappears and the one loop effects vanish in the large mass limit .",
    "the higgs sector of the mssm belongs to this case .    at the tree level , both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 coupling constants of the thdm can largely deviate from the sm values due to the higgs mixing effect .",
    "the @xmath1 coupling is given by the multiplication of the factor @xmath26 to the sm coupling constant , where @xmath27 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values and @xmath28 is the mixing angle between cp - even higgs bosons .",
    "in the limit of @xmath29 , where the @xmath1 coupling recovers the sm value , the @xmath2 coupling also approaches to the sm prediction for a given mass of the higgs boson @xmath0 .",
    "we study how this correlation can be changed by the one loop corrections .",
    "we evaluate the one loop effects due to additional higgs bosons as well as the top quark under the constraint from the perturbative unitarity@xcite and the vacuum stability@xcite .",
    "the constraint from the available precision data such as the @xmath30 parameter constraint is also taken into account@xcite .",
    "the one loop effect on the @xmath1 coupling can be as large as ( minus ) one percent of the sm coupling in the wide range of parameter space .",
    "this shows that a larger negative deviation can only be realized due to the higgs mixing effect , i.e. , the effect of the factor @xmath26 .",
    "if the observed @xmath1 coupling agrees with the sm prediction within the 1% accuracy , we may not be able to distinguish the quantum effect from the tree level mixing effect .",
    "the deviation in the @xmath2 coupling can be as large as ( plus ) @xmath3 percent for the mass of @xmath0 to be around 120 gev due to the non - decoupling quantum effect of the heavy extra higgs bosons .",
    "this happens even in the sm - like limit , @xmath31 .",
    "such magnitude of the deviation is larger than the experimental accuracy that is expected to be @xmath32-@xmath33 % at lcs@xcite , and can be experimentally detected .",

    "there have been several studies for the correlation between the change of the @xmath2 coupling and the production cross sections at the lhc@xcite and lcs@xcite . from the conclusions in those studies",
    ", we expect that the large non - decoupling effect in the @xmath2 couplings in the thdm can be detected at future experiments at the lc s .",
    "we finally comment on the case of the mssm .",
    "since the higgs sector of the mssm is a special case of the model ii thdm with @xmath404 , as required by supersymmetry , it belongs to the class of models in which the heavier higgs bosons decouple .",
    "hence , the effect of the higgs boson loops to @xmath405 is expected to be small .",
    "a detailed study on this decoupling behavior of the one loop corrected @xmath2 coupling in the mssm can be found in refs .",
    "we confirmed that our results for large values of @xmath107 are consistent with those in ref .",
    "we have discussed the one loop contributions of the heavy additional higgs bosons to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 couplings in the thdm .",
    "the form factors have been calculated in the on - shell scheme , and the deviation from the sm predictions are evaluated .",
    "the renormalized couplings of @xmath1 and @xmath2 can deviate from the sm predictions due to two origins : the tree level mixing effect between the higgs bosons and the quantum effect of the additional particles in the loop .",
    "we found that the deviations in the form factors can be large due to the non - decoupling effect of the heavy additional higgs bosons when their masses are predominantly generated from the vacuum expectation value of the electroweak symmetry breaking ; i.e. , in a strongly - coupled thdm .",
    "in particular , the renormalized @xmath2 coupling can largely deviate from the sm prediction due to the quartic power term of the masses of the heavy higgs bosons , especially when the mass of the lightest higgs boson @xmath0 is relatively small . even in the case",
    "where approximately only @xmath0 couples to the weak gauge boson so that the mixing effect is small , the deviation in the @xmath2 coupling from the sm value can be as large as a few 100% , while that in the @xmath1 coupling is at most a few times of @xmath406 or less .",
    "when the tree level mixing effect of the higgs bosons is significant , the deviation in the @xmath1 coupling becomes significant by the factor of @xmath26 while the large positive deviation in the @xmath2 coupling due to quantum effect is smeared by the mixing effect .",
    "such large quantum effect on the higgs tri - linear coupling is distinguishable from the born - level mixing effect , and can be detectable at a linear collider .    in the weakly - coupled thdm , where the masses of the heavy higgs bosons are predominantly generated from the soft breaking mass term @xmath107 , the one loop effect is small and decouples in the large mass limit .",
    "we have shown how the non - decoupling effect of the additional heavy particles in the thdm can differ the higgs boson couplings @xmath1 and @xmath2 from the sm prediction .",
    "we stress that the quartic mass effect on the effective @xmath2 coupling is a general characteristic in any new physics model which has the non - decoupling property .    *",
