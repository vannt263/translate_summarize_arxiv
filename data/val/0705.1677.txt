    "close - orbiting giant exoplanets that transit their parent stars offer unique insights into the interior structure and evolution of gas - giant planets .",
    "they are the only extrasolar planets whose radii and masses can be determined unambiguously from their light curves and radial - velocity variations . the discovery of the first such planet , hd 209458b @xcite , established its gas - giant nature .",
    "since then , 13 other transiting planets have been discovered , revealing a diverse range of densities and hence internal compositions .",
    "the saturn - mass planet hd 149026b represents one extreme , having a high density requiring a substantial rock / ice core . at the other end of the density scale one finds hd 209458b , hat - p-1b @xcite and wasp-1b @xcite .",
    "these planets have densities so low that even coreless models have difficulty reproducing their radii @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the core masses inferred for then - known transiting planets show a weak correlation with the metallicity of the parent star .",
    "@xcite find a similar trend .",
    "they also noted that , and @xcite have very similar masses but substantially different radii . in the absence of detailed spectroscopic abundance analyses for wasp-1 and wasp-2 , however , it is difficult to determine a likely cause for their inflated radii .",
    "wasp-1b has , in comparison with other planets , a very low density ; it is 2.4 times as massive as hd 149026b , but also 3.3 times less dense .",
    "this poses a significant challenge to existing theoretical models . @xcite",
    "find it hard to reconcile the planet s large radius @xmath6 @xcite with evolutionary tracks even for coreless models with ten - times - solar atmospheric abundances and ages greater than 1.5 gyr .",
    "this leads to a wide range of speculations . could it be possible that the star ( and by implication its planet ) is relatively young , and thus still contracting",
    "could the strong irradiation of the planet inhibit contraction @xcite ? can additional interior opacity due to enhanced atmospheric metallicity slow contraction @xcite ? or perhaps ( as a counter - argument )",
    "can an increased interior molecular weight due to enhanced atmospheric metallicity accelerate contraction ? can tidal heating caused by orbital eccentricity @xcite or rotational obliquity @xcite provide additional interior pressure support ?",
    "given so many theoretical candidate mechanisms for inflating a planet s radius , comparative studies of the rapidly - growing number of stars that host well - characterised transiting planets are essential if we are to identify the dominant environmental and evolutionary processes that determine a mature gas - giant planet s internal structure and outer radius .",
    "here we present a detailed analysis of the spectrum of the parent star to wasp-1b , wasp-1 (= gsc 0226500107 ) , with the goal of establishing its metallicity and evolutionary status .",
    "we use as our starting point the preliminary stellar parameters published by @xcite .",
    "although their analysis is roughly similar to the one presented here , the spectra they obtained from the sophie spectrograph at ohp were compromised by background scattered - light contamination and uncertain continuum normalization , leaving the metallicity unconstrained .",
    "we also compare the metallicity , effective temperature and evolutionary age to those of the very similar host star of hd  149028b , and discuss whether the properties of the host stars give any useful clues to the strongly - contrasting densities of their close - orbiting gas - giant planets .",
    "wasp-1 was observed in early january 2007 at the 2.5 m nordic optical telescope ( not ) , as part of the science verification program of the newly commissioned spectrograph fies ( fiber echelle spectrograph ) .",
    "we obtained a total of seven spectra on six nights , with a spectral resolution of @xmath7 and an exposure time of 20 minutes each , covering the wavelength region @xmath8@xmath9 at a signal - to - noise of 4050 in each spectrum .",
    "the fies spectrograph is a bench - mounted fiber - fed echelle spectrograph , located in its own temperature - stabilized building and without any moving parts .",
    "with such a particular setup one obtains very stable spectra in a fixed format for which one of the authors ( hcs ) developed an automated data reduction system .",
    "this system uses python and pyraf to access the echelle reduction routines of iraf .",
    "the reduction is fine - tuned for the properties of fies , and performs all necessary reduction steps , such as subtraction of biases and scattered light , flat - fielding , order extraction , normalization ( including fringe - correction ) and wavelength calibration , leaving the observer with fully - reduced spectra ready for scientific analysis .    using the associated wavelength calibration frames we corrected each spectrum for instrumental shifts .",
    "we also applied the correction for the heliocentric velocity and checked and calibrated the spectra against a radial velocity standard . for the purpose of determining the stellar parameters of wasp-1",
    ", we also created one high - quality spectrum with excellent signal - to - noise ( @xmath10 ) by combining the seven individual spectra into one .",
    "the seven individual spectra we obtained provide an independent check of the sinusoidal radial - velocity variations detected in wasp-1 by @xcite . in order to obtain the best accuracy , we cross - correlated high signal - to - noise regions of the spectra on an order - by - order basis . in this analysis we excluded orders that contain atmospheric features .",
    "this allowed us to determine radial velocities with an accuracy of @xmath11 m s@xmath12 .",

    "we make identical assumptions and use of the same tools , techniques and grid of model atmosheres , allowing us to obtain stellar parameters for that can be directly compared to the results of vf05 .",
    "we analysed our high - quality spectrum of wasp-1 with sme ( spectroscopy made easy , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , an idl - based program that uses synthetic spectra and multi - dimensional least - squares minimization to determine the best set of stellar parameters ( the effective temperature @xmath40 , the gravity @xmath17 , the metallicity [ m / h ] , the projected radial velocity @xmath34 , the systemic radial velocity @xmath37 , the microturbulence @xmath41 and the macroturbulence @xmath42 ) that describe an observed spectrum .",
    "successful calculation of synthetic spectra requires a grid of model atmospheres covering the parameter space of interest , as well as accurate line lists of atomic transitions . in analogy with vf05",
    ", we used for our analysis the routine for 3-dimensional interpolation on the @xcite grid of lte model atmospheres .",
    "atomic line data was obtained from the vald database @xcite . to improve our ability to model the stellar spectrum in the spectral regions of interest ( see below ) , we adjusted the oscillator strengths and broadening parameters for some of the lines in our line lists .",
    "this was done by comparing the nso spectrum of the sun @xcite to a synthetic spectrum ( using the parameters @xmath43 k , @xmath44 , @xmath45 kms@xmath12 , @xmath46 kms@xmath12 ( gravitational blueshift ) , @xmath47 kms@xmath12 and @xmath48 kms@xmath12 and solar abundances ) .",
    "we also checked our results against a high - quality spectrum of procyon , obtained with fies at the not ( for stellar parameters , see * ? ? ?",
    "in order to use assumptions identical to those of vf05 , we decoupled the correlation between microturbulence @xmath41 and metallicity by fixing the value of @xmath41 to 0.85 kms@xmath12 .",
    "similarly we followed their empirical relation for the value of the macroturbulence , giving @xmath49 kms@xmath12 for a star with @xmath50 k ( see also sect .",
    "[ sec : errors ] for additional remarks on the choice of macroturbulence ) .",
    "we also released the elemental abundances of five elements ( na , si , ti , fe and ni ) . as an initial guess we used the parameters determined by @xcite , as well as [ m / h ] @xmath51 , @xmath52 kms@xmath12 , and ( fe / h ) @xmath53 .    to constrain the full set of stellar parameters we identified three important wavelength regions ( @xmath54@xmath55 , @xmath56@xmath57 and @xmath58@xmath59 ) .",
    "the first region contains the triplet of mgb lines , primarily sensitive to @xmath17 , while the second region contains a large number of well - isolated and unresolved spectral lines of a range of different elements , sensitive to @xmath37 , @xmath34 , [ m / h ] , and the individual elemental abundances in particular .",
    "the third region covers the broad h@xmath60 6563 line .",
    "although this region was not included by vf05 , we consider this region as a strong indicator to constrain effective temperature .",
    "the broadening of the outer wings of this line is sensitive to @xmath14 , and largely independent of other stellar parameters .",
    "our synthetic synthesis calculations use the state - of - the - art hydrogen line broadening theory of @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that this theory can accurately reproduce the balmer line wings of stars with a range of different spectral types , and that it produces good agreement with the results of the infrared flux method ( irfm ) developed by @xcite , but with smaller error margins .",
    "they also showed that there is a weak dependence on the model atmosphere used .    during our analysis",
    "we encountered difficulties in obtaining a good fit to the wings of the mgb lines , sensitive to changes in @xmath17 . while we obtained good agreement with other @xmath17-sensitive spectral features ( notably the wings of ca i 6122 and ca i 6162 ) , as well as with the spectra of the sun and procyon , the synthetic profiles for the mgb lines remained too wide .",
    "determining @xmath17 from the mg b lines alone yielded a very low value of @xmath61 , which is strongly inconsistent with the photometrically determined radius of wasp-1 .",
    "however , this apparent inconsistency can be reconciled by adjusting the elemental abundance of [ mg / h ] .",
    "because our selected wavelength regions do not contain mg lines other than mg b , we determined the mg abundance in wasp-1 from seven weak mg lines in other regions of the spectrum ( mg  i  5528.4 , 5711.1 , 5785.3 , 5785.6 , 6318.7 , 6319.2 and 6319.5  ) .",
    "we find [ mg / h]@xmath62 , indicating that mg is indeed underabundant by @xmath63 in . similar underabundances in mg ( and na ) for metal rich stars and exoplanets hosts was reported by @xcite , although other comprehensive studies by @xcite and @xcite do not confirm such a trend .",
    "we then redetermined the stellar parameters of wasp-1 , treating [ mg / h ] as a fixed parameter .",
    "this produced only minor changes in the derived stellar parameters , but also a good agreement between the observed and synthetic profiles around the mg b line complex .",
    "the final set of parameters we obtained from the analysis with sme are listed in table  [ tab : params ] .",
    "we also reproduce the synthetic spectra of the best choice of parameters in fig  [ fig : profs ] .",
    "we would like to point out that all parameters were determined simultaneously across all three wavelength regions , thus obtaining a self - consistent solution .",
    "as vf05 point out , the formal uncertainties reported by sme strongly underestimate the true uncertainties because the value of the goodness - of - fit parameter @xmath64 is not dominated by the signal - to - noise of our spectra , but rather by uncertainties in the data reduction ( for example , continuum fitting ) as well as by inaccuracies in the synthetic spectra calculations .",
    "thus , in analogy with vf05 , we individually analysed our seven spectra of with sme , and quote the square root of the variance of the measurements of each parameter as the uncertainty in table  [ tab : params ] .",
    "spectroscopically determined fundamental parameters tend to show strong correlations , and any uncertainty in one parameter may be propagated to other parameters .",
    "we investigated the magnitude of these correlations by varying @xmath14 with @xmath65  k , and determining a new optimal solution at these temperatures , thus propagating the uncertainty in temperature to the other parameters .",
    "the correlated uncertainties ( listed in table [ tab : params ] ) indicate that the uncertainties due to parameter correlations are of similar order of magnitude as the uncertainties derived earlier from the scatter of measurements of the seven individual spectra .",
    "in addition to propagating the uncertainties related to temperature , we also looked at the relation between [ mg / h ] , [ m / h ] and @xmath17 , as these may be expected to correlate through the mg b line complex .",
    "we find a clear correlation between [ mg / h ] and [ m / h ] , such that [ mg / h ] always shows a relative underabundance of about @xmath66 with respect to [ m / h ] .",
    "on the other hand we see no indication that the value of @xmath17 correlates with [ mg / h ] , mainly because each parameter is well constrained by diagnostics other than mg b ( i.e. the weak mg lines and the broadening of ca i 6122 and ca i 6162 ) .    one pair of parameters that shows a strong correlation are the assumed value of the macroturbulence @xmath42 and the obtained projected rotational velocity @xmath34 .",
    "this is no surprise , because the observed photospheric line profiles are a convolution of rotational and turbulent broadening . in our analysis",
    "we have assumed a value of 4.5 kms@xmath12 , similar to the choice of vf05 .",
    "this value is in agreement with several other empirical relations for main - sequence type stars ( see vf05 ) .",
    "however , the parameters we derive for wasp-1 could indicate that wasp-1 is starting to evolve off the main - sequence ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : evol ] ) , which would imply a slight increase in @xmath42 , to approximately @xmath67 kms@xmath12 . using higher values for",
    "@xmath42 would result in a lower value of the @xmath34 , thus the value we quote in table [ tab : params ] should be considered an upper limit .",
    "in addition to the spectroscopic estimate , we also determined the effective temperature using the irfm .",
    "this method allows for a nearly model - independent determination of @xmath14 obtained from the integrated stellar flux at the earth and a measurement at an infrared wavelength .    for wasp-1 we used the tycho @xmath68 and @xmath69 magnitudes and the 2mass magnitudes to estimate the integrated flux ( @xmath70 ) by fitting kurucz flux distributions .",
    "since wasp-1 is relatively nearby and out of galactic plane we assumed zero reddening . integrating the fitted distributions gives a value of @xmath71 w m@xmath72 .",
    "using the irfm to determine the @xmath14 for the @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 bands , we obtain an average @xmath76 k , which is in close agreement with the spectroscopic determination .",
    "( a modified hertzprung - russel diagram ) of the host stars of the 14 known transiting extra - solar planets ( asterisks , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , including ( solid circle ) .",
    "here we present isochrones for super - solar metallicity stellar evolution models from @xcite ( solid ) , @xcite ( dotted ) , and @xcite ( dashed ) .",

    "the stellar parameters derived from the detailed spectroscopic analysis described above can be used to place in its evolutionary context , providing further constraints on the age of the host star and its planet .",
    "both the effective temperature and the ( photometrically determined ) stellar radius are measured to high accuracy using well understood , robust physics that is largely model independent .",
    "thus in fig .",
    "[ fig : hrd ] , we plot a modified hertzprung - russel diagram in which the radius acts as a proxy for luminosity ( as it is related to luminosity through the temperature ) and compare the properties of wasp-1 to several different super - solar metallicity stellar evolution models @xcite between 13  gyr .",
    "the position of wasp-1 in this diagram shows that its its age is likely to be in the range 13 gyr and that its large stellar radius may be explained by the fact that the star is beginning to evolve off the main sequence .",
    "we note that the mass initially adopted for wasp-1 , @xmath77 , @xcite is marginally inconsistent with the @xmath17 found here , when combined with the latest estimates of the stellar radius ( @xmath78 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a slightly higher mass of @xmath79@xmath80 would allow all the measured values of @xmath17 , temperature , and radius to be consistent given their errors .",
    "an interesting feature in the spectrum of wasp-1 is the the strong lithium absorption line at @xmath81 . as stars only destroy lithium , the amount of photospheric lithium is often used as an age indicator",
    "however , the accuracy of age estimates based on lithium abundances depends strongly on the efficiency with which stars deplete lithium .",
    "stars such as wasp-1 , with temperatures of @xmath82 k , can not deplete lithium very easily from their surface layers , because the bottom of the convection zone does not reach temperatures high enough to burn lithium .",
    "it is also cooler than 6300 k , the lower limit of the so - called `` li dip '' or `` boesgaard gap '' ( for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where lithium depletion is enhanced by an as yet unknown process .",
    "still , early type stars do slowly deplete lithium during their main sequence lifetimes @xcite , allowing modest constraints to be placed on the age on wasp-1 based on the abundance of lithium present in the photosphere .",
    "in the spectrum of wasp-1 , li i 6708  has an equivalenth width of @xmath83 m . using sme and the atmospheric parameters derived earlier , we find that this corresponds to an elemental abundance of @xmath84 , or @xmath85 in more conventional units ( see figure [ fig : liplot ] ) .",
    "we find a weak correlation between @xmath14 and @xmath22 , where a decrease in temperature by 50 k relates to a decrease in @xmath22 by 0.05 .    the value @xmath3 is less than the commonly adopted value of 3.2 for the primordial lithium abundance .",
    "still , it is a the high end with respect to the study by @xcite , who compared the amount of lithium in exoplanet host stars with a set of reference stars .",
    "we also compared our value of @xmath22 with the empirical relations of lithium depletion in open clusters derived by @xcite .",
    "their study shows that , for stars with temperatures of @xmath86 k , lithium can be expected to reach @xmath87 after 13 gyr .",
    "this age estimate is consistent with what we derived earlier from evolutionary tracks .     in @xmath22 .",
    "the thick line corresponds to the optimum value , @xmath88 .",
    "changes of @xmath65 k in the stellar effective temperature result in changes of @xmath89 in the lithium abundance ( see text ) . ]",
    "our spectroscopic analysis , together with the stellar mass and radius estimates inferred from previous studies , reveal a remarkable similarity between the physical parameters of wasp-1 and hd  149026 ( see table [ tab : compare ] .",
    "the two stars appear to be very similar in both mass and evolutionary status .",
    "@xcite estimate the age of hd 149026 to be @xmath90  gyr .",
    "also the environments in which the two planets orbit are remarkably similar .",
    "wasp-1b orbits slightly closer to a slightly cooler star , with the result that its blackbody effective temperature ( assuming a low albedo and efficient redistribution and reradiation of heat from the night side ) is just 80  k warmer than that of hd  149026b .",
    "the structural differences between the two planets contrasts starkly with the similarities of the parent stars .",
    "the light , saturn - mass hd 149026b requires a core mass of several tens of earth masses to reproduce its small radius and high density @xcite .",
    "wasp-1b is more than twice as massive and has a much larger radius .",
    "this can only be reconciled with the models of @xcite if it has little or no core , its atmosphere is metal - rich , and its age is less than 1.5 gyr .    .a comparison between the stellar and planetary parameters of wasp-1 and hd  149026 .",
    "data for hd  149026 are taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "data for wasp-1 are from @xcite and @xcite , except @xmath91 , [ fe / h ] and the age estimate , which are from this paper .",

    "we conclude that the final balance between core and envelope mass in giant planets can not be a simple function of stellar metallicity , nor of radiation environment . as @xcite conclude , the final composition of a planet is more likely to be dictated by the details of the disk environment in which the planet formed , and possibly the dynamical history following the envelope accretion phase , than by the composition of the parent star .",
