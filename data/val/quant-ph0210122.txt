    "ponderomotive systems are physical systems where the electromagnetic pressure force gives rise to relevant effects . the optomechanical coupling between a movable mirror and a radiation field , is realized in such systems when the field is reflected by the moving mirror .",
    "this coupling was introduced in the context of quantum limited measurements @xcite and then used in interferometric gravitational - wave detection @xcite as well as in atomic force microscope @xcite . since then , a wide literature has been devoted to such a coupling . in particular , it has been shown that it may lead to nonclassical states of both the radiation field @xcite , and the motion of the mirror @xcite .",
    "the interest about ponderomotive systems also relies on the possibility to investigate , with them , the tricky borderline between the quantum and the classical world @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent technical progresses have made this area experimentally accessible @xcite .",
    "the appearance of quantum effects in ponderomotive systems , paves the way to use them also for quantum information purposes @xcite .",
    "these require as main ingredient the entanglement @xcite .",
    "furthermore , information processing , in the quantum optical framework , can be implemented when applied to continuous quadratures of electromagnetic modes @xcite .",
    "then , the use of a ponderomotive meter for continuous variable entanglement purification has been investigated in ref.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the possibility to obtain quantum correlated quadratures of the field reflected by a movable mirror has been proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite . here , following the line sketched in ref.@xcite , we study a ponderomotive system , namely a radiation field reflected by an oscillating mirror , from the quantum information perspective . in particular , in section",
    "ii , we shall show that the mechanical motion of the mirror mediates information between the field modes leading to an effective mode - mode interaction . in section iii",
    ", we shall characterize the modes entanglement on the basis of recent criteria @xcite .",
    "we shall also account for the effect of the thermal noise associate to the mirror s motion .",
    "then , in section iv , we shall evaluate the performances of such ponderomotive entanglement in possible applications like teleportation @xcite and telecloning @xcite .",
    "finally , section v is for concluding remarks .",
    "the model we are going to consider is schematically depicted in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "it consists of a linear cavity , with an oscillating end mirror , plunged in a thermal reservoir at the equilibrium temperature @xmath0 .",
    "this completely reflecting mirror , with mass @xmath1 , can move back and forth along the cavity axes . when the cavity is empty the moving mirror undergoes harmonic oscillations at frequency @xmath2 , damped at rate @xmath3 by the coupling to the external bath . in presence of a radiation field ,",
    "the cavity length varies under the action of the radiation pressure force , which causes the instantaneous displacement of the mirror .    the resonant frequencies of the cavity are calculated at the equilibrium position of the oscillating mirror , resulting @xmath4 where @xmath5 is an arbitrary integer number corresponding to the index @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the speed of light , and @xmath8 is the equilibrium cavity length .",
    "we consider the possibility to have several input fields at frequencies @xmath9 driving the corresponding cavity modes . in the adiabatic limit",
    "in which the mirror frequency is much smaller than the cavity free spectral range @xmath10 we can focus only on the driven cavity modes , obtaining the following hamiltonian    [ ham ] @xmath11    where the sum must be intended over the driven modes .",
    "@xmath12 is the hamiltonian for the free motion of the mechanical oscillator ( moving mirror ) having position @xmath13 and momentum @xmath14 , and of the cavity modes characterized by the ladder operators @xmath15 .",
    "instead , @xmath16 describes the input fields , with amplitudes @xmath17 , entering the cavity through the fixed mirror whose partial transmission determines the input - output rate @xmath18 .",
    "finally , @xmath19 represents the ponderomotive interaction between the mirror and the radiation fields @xcite .",
    "such interaction is generated by the radiation pressure induced variation of the cavity length , which corresponds to a variation of the frequencies ( energy levels ) through eq.([wcn ] ) , that is @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "since we shall consider few modes whose @xmath22 differ not too much each other , we can set @xmath23 , as the optomechanical coupling constant .    by using eqs.([ham ] ) , and accounting for the losses and the noises , we can describe the complete dynamics of the system through the following quantum langevin equations    [ nl ] @xmath24    where we have used the replacements @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath26 are the vacuum noise operators associated to the input radiation fields , while @xmath27 is the noise operator for the quantum brownian motion of the mirror .",
    "the noise correlations are @xcite    [ nct ] @xmath28 }     { \\exp\\,\\left(\\,-\\,i\\,\\omega\\,\\left(t - t^{\\prime}\\,\\right)\\,\\right ) }     \\right\\}\\,,\\label{corrnoiset}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath29 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "it is worth noting that eq.([corrnoiset ] ) gives the exact thermal noise correlations at any temperature @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "we are now going to study the dynamics of the small fluctuations around the steady state , i.e. the dynamics of the operators    @xmath31    where the ( classical ) stationary values are given by    [ ss ] @xmath32    with @xmath33 the ( dimensionless ) overall detuning due to the frequency mismatch and to the radiation phase shift caused by the stationary displacement @xmath34 of the mirror .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we assume , from now on , symmetric conditions for the various radiation modes , that is , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 . then , it is easily recognizable in eq.([alfa ] ) the nonlinear relation between input and intracavity intensity field which give rise to the bistable behavior of the system @xcite .",
    "linearizing eqs.([nl ] ) around the steady state ( [ ss ] ) we obtain    [ l ] @xmath38          \\,-\\,2\\,\\gamma_{m}\\,p(t)\\,-      \\,\\xi(t)\\ , ,      \\\\",

    "furthermore , @xmath46 is a @xmath47 matrix written as @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are @xmath51 matrices given by    [ mdmo ] @xmath52    the useful noise correlations for eq.([compact ] ) come from eqs.([nct ] ) , ( [ quad ] ) and read    [ corrxy ] @xmath53    and @xmath54 thus eqs.([compact])-([corrnoise ] ) completely describe the dynamics of the small fluctuations of radiation modes .",
    "practically , we can see from eqs.([l ] ) that the mirror mediates information between the radiation modes leading to an effective mode - mode interaction as results from eqs.([compact ] ) , ( [ m ] ) and ( [ mdmo ] ) .",
    "the above discussed mode - mode interaction will presumably lead to entanglement between intracavity modes , which , in turn , should be reflected on the fields outgoing the cavity . on the other hand ,",
    "only these latter become really useful . hence",
    ", we are going to characterize their correlations .",
    "first of all we notice , by the the input - output theory @xcite , that @xmath55 then , we introduce the hermitian output quadrature operators    [ rxy ] @xmath56    their correlations are described by the @xmath57 matrix @xmath58^{t}\\ ,      + \\,{\\bf v}^{\\,out}(-\\omega)\\ ,      \\left[{\\bf v}^{\\,out}(\\omega)\\right]^{t}\\,\\rangle\\ , ,      \\\\      & = & \\frac{1}{4}\\,{\\cal k}(\\omega)\\,\\langle\\,{\\bf   v}^{\\,in}(\\omega)\\ ,      \\left[{\\bf v}^{\\,in}(-\\omega)\\right]^{t}\\,\\rangle\\ ,      \\left[{\\cal k}(-\\omega)\\right]^{t}\\ ,      \\nonumber\\\\      & + & \\,\\frac{1}{4}\\,{\\cal k}(-\\omega)\\,\\langle\\,{\\bf v}^{\\,in}(-\\omega)\\ ,      \\left[{\\bf v}^{\\,in}(\\omega)\\right]^{t}\\,\\rangle\\ ,      \\left[{\\cal k}(\\omega)\\right]^{t}\\,\\nonumber      \\\\      & + & \\frac{\\gamma_{c}}{4}\\,{\\cal l}^{-1}(\\omega)\\,{\\bf s}(\\omega)\\ ,      \\left[{\\bf s}(-\\omega)\\right]^{t}\\,\\left[{\\cal l}^{-1}(-\\omega )      \\right]^{t}\\ ,      \\langle\\,\\xi(\\omega)\\,\\xi(-\\omega)\\,\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\      & + & \\frac{\\gamma_{c}}{4}\\,{\\cal l}^{-1}(-\\omega)\\,{\\bf s}(-\\omega)\\ ,      \\left[{\\bf s }      ( \\omega)\\right]^{t}\\,\\left[{\\cal l}^{-1}(\\omega)\\right]^{t}\\,\\langle\\ ,      \\xi(-\\omega)\\,\\xi(\\omega)\\,\\rangle\\,,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where    [ ak ] @xmath59    with @xmath60 the identity @xmath57 matrix . however , the matrix @xmath61 is not symmetric and , moreover , it concerns quadratures with frequency dependent commutator , i.e. , @xmath62\\,\\rangle\\,=\\,i\\,c(\\omega)\\,,\\quad \\forall n\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath7 a real positive definite function of frequency @xmath63 . therefore , to easily apply quantum information arguments to our system , we construct from eqs.([cormat ] ) , ( [ comm ] ) a symmetric correlation matrix concerning quadratures with canonical commutation relations , that is @xmath64 by virtue of the linearization procedure adopted in sec.ii we have , for each frequency , a multivariate gaussian state completely characterized by eq.([gamat ] ) .",
    "we now restrict the attention to only two mode ( @xmath65 ) in order to study the entanglement of a bipartite system .",
    "practically we consider @xmath66 and we introduce the matrices @xmath67 then , eq.([m2 ] ) leads to @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are @xmath51 matrices . in this case",
    "the simon s criterion @xcite is necessary and sufficient for entanglement , and , according to eq.(19 ) of ref.@xcite we can define a marker of entanglement as @xmath71 so that , if it goes below @xmath72 , the state is entangled .",
    "instead , the product criterion introduced in ref.@xcite , and reminiscent of nonlocality criterion @xcite , gives @xmath73 finally , the sum criterion , expressed by eq.(3 ) of ref.@xcite , can be rewritten as @xmath74 then , in fig.[fig2 ] we report the marker of entanglement @xmath75 versus @xmath76 , for the three criteria a ) simon , b ) product , c ) sum .",
    "the parameters values are taken similar to those of the experimental set up of ref.@xcite .",
    "they are written in tab.i .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] shows that in case of no detuning the product and the sum criteria do not reveal any entanglement , while the simon criterion do .",
    "this proves the weakness of the the entanglement coming in this case from the interaction of only amplitude quadratures as can be evicted from eqs.([m2 ] ) and ( [ mdmo ] ) .",
    "such type of entanglement , although resistant to thermal effects , is practically useless in information processing like teleportation whose performance are much more related to the product and sum criteria @xcite .",
    "[ parametri ]    .parameter values [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     then in figs.[fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] we have only considered the sum criterion and we have shown the beneficial effect of the detuning on the entanglement . as matter of fact it allows interaction of both amplitude and phase quadratures as can be seen in eq.([m2 ] ) .",
    "in particular fig.[fig4 ] exhibits the presence of entanglement at low frequencies ( according to ref.@xcite ) as well as near the mechanical resonance .",
    "neverthless , the latter turns out to be more sensible to the thermal noise .",
    "this behavior resembles that of the light squeezing studied in refs.@xcite .",
    "characterization of multipartite entanglement ( @xmath77 ) is a more complex issue @xcite . in general",
    ", multi - party inseparability criteria can not be formulated in compact form as for the two - party .",
    "here , we consider @xmath78 , thus the matrix @xmath79 which leads to @xmath80 although for three - mode gaussian states there exist a necessary and sufficient separability criterion @xcite , its violation does not necessarily witness genuine tripartite entanglement .",
    "however , from the symmetry of matrix ( [ v3 ] ) we easily deduce that the conditions for bipartite entanglement also give tripartite entanglement . as matter of fact a tripartite fully inseparable state",
    "is that which can not be separate for any grouping of the parties @xcite .",
    "but , due to the symmetry among the parties , if two of them show entanglement according to sec .",
    "iii a , then any two of them show entanglement , thus revealing a fully inseparable state .",
    "this ponderomotive entanglement find possible applications in quantum information processings with continuous variables @xcite . here",
    ", we deal with the possibility of using it for remote state transfer . by referring to fig.[fig1 ] ,",
    "the modes outgoing the cavity can be separated and one of them can reach a sending station while the others reach receiving stations . then , all these modes constitute the quantum channel to exploit for transferring a quantum state from the sending station to the receiving ones .",
    "we will analyze in detail the case for @xmath65 , i.e. , teleportation @xcite , and @xmath78 , i.e. , telecloning @xcite .      the standard teleportation protocol for continuous variable @xcite",
    "can be described by a convolution of the wigner functions @xcite    [ wouttp ] @xmath81    where @xmath82 is the wigner function of the received state , @xmath83 that of the unknown state to be transferred ( sent ) , and @xmath84 that describing the quantum channel between the two stations , i.e. , the two entangled modes characterized by the correlation matrix ( [ v2 ] ) . here",
    ", small greek letters are for complex variables .    by fourier transforming eqs.([wouttp ] ) , we get a simple relation for the characteristic functions @xmath85 , namely @xmath86 where @xmath87 where the variables with the subscript @xmath72 ( @xmath88 ) represent the real ( imaginary ) part of the corresponding complex variables , and @xmath89 is a four dimensional real variables vector .",

    "to be teleported we have chosen the coherent state for which @xmath98 .",
    "in such a case the upper bound for the fidelity achievable with only classical means and no quantum resources is @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "then , we see that this bound is overcame just in correspondence of the minima of fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "also the behavior of the fidelity in terms of thermal noise reflects that of the entanglement in fig.[fig4 ] .      as a simple extension of the arguments used for teleportation ,",
    "we can write the wigner function of the received state ( at the two stations ) by the convolution @xcite    @xmath100    where @xmath101 is the wigner function describing the quantum channel between sending and receiving stations , i.e. the three entangled modes characterized by the correlation matrix ( [ v3 ] ) .    the state at one receiving station can be obtained by tracing the received state ( [ wclon ] ) over the other receiving station . due to the symmetry , the two possible states coming out coincide .",
    "thus , we can assume @xmath102 where now @xmath103 by again fourier transforming eq.([wclonb ] ) , we end up with a relation for the characteristic functions identical to eq.([chi - out ] ) , @xmath104 where now @xmath105 and @xmath106\\,,\\ ] ] is the characteristic function describing the three - mode channel , thus characterized by the matrix @xmath91 given in eq.([v3 ] ) , with @xmath89 a 6 dimensional real variables vector .",

    "to be telecloned we have choosen again a coherent state for which @xmath98 .",
    "also in this case the upper classical bound for the fidelity is @xmath99 @xcite .",

    "in conclusion , we have studied _ ponderomotive entanglement _ , that is entanglement between radiation modes generated by the radiation pressure effects . in doing so",
    "we have also provided a comparison between different entanglement criteria .",
    "practically , we have shown that even a classical force , like radiation pressure force , together with macroscopic objects can be used for quantum information purposes .",
    "the fidelity achievable in remote state transfer widely overcome the classical bounds , thought not reaching the optimal values .",
