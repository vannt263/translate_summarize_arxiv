    "analytic continuation arises in the many - body problem whenever real time dynamics are to be recovered from a response function calculated at non - zero temperatures in the matsubara formalism . in that case , the function whose value is known only at a discrete set of points on the imaginary axis must be continued to the real axis .    a general statement of the problem of interest in this paper is as follows : an analytic continuation of a function @xmath0 defined on a subset @xmath1 is a function that coincides with @xmath0 on @xmath2 and is analytic on a domain containing @xmath2 .",
    "usually , we are interested in the analytic continuation @xmath3 with the largest such domain , for then @xmath3 is the greatest analytic extension of @xmath0 to the complex plane . since there exists no general prescription for finding @xmath3 from @xmath0 ,",
    "there is no choice but to resort to approximate techniques .",
    "currently , the state of the  art \" is to interpolate between known points using fitting functions capable of reproducing the analytic structure of @xmath3 in the complex plane @xcite .",
    "a serious difficulty is that the analytic structure of @xmath3 is not usually known a priori .",
    "a widely used technique is the pad approximant method in which ratios of polynomials ( or terminating continued fractions ) are used as fitting functions .",
    "several pad schemes exist . the most common scheme , a recursive algorithm called thiele s reciprocal difference method@xcite , was used by vidberg and serene@xcite in the context of the eliashberg equations .",
    "yet , despite twenty years of widespread use , the pad approximant method remains somewhat of an untested approach in that there is still no reliable , quantitative measure of the quality of a pad result .",
    "the prevailing wisdom is that a pad fit can be considered ` good ' when the output function is stable with respect to the addition of more input points .",
    "the results of this work make it clear that such a criterion is insufficient .",
    "the various pad schemes can be divided into two broad classes : ( i ) those which return the value of the continued function point by point in the complex plane @xmath4 and ( ii ) those which yield the function itself @xmath5 by returning the polynomial ( or continued fraction ) coefficients .",
    "thiele s method is class i , as are most numerical methods . in this work we present a robust pad scheme that is class ii and",
    "propose a goodness - of - fit criterion based on the convergence of the polynomial coefficients to allowed values .",
    "one advantage of our approach is that we formulate the problem as a matrix equation , allowing us to make use of existing , highly efficient routines for matrix inversion . in contrast",
    ", a navely implemented recursion algorithm can lead to a severe propagation of error since repeated operations are performed on terms of very different orders of magnitude .    our paper is organized as follows . in the next section we review the formal aspects of thermal green s functions to establish the definitions of the various functions that enter into this problem . in ",
    "iii we present the details of the pad form that we will use , and state the algorithm that we use to solve for the pad coefficients .",
    "this leads to the consideration of the accuracy required for such a calculation , thus necessitating the use of a high accuracy symbolic computation algorithm .",
    "this is presented in ",
    "iv , and then we display our numerical results for relevant test functions , including the statistical test that allows us to conclude whether or not a given analytic continuation is accurate . finally , in  v we present our conclusions .",
    "first , we introduce the components of theories based on thermal green s functions to establish the definitions of the various functions that enter into this problem .    the one - particle propagator or green s function can be formulated using real or imaginary time operators . in real time , the retarded green s function @xmath6 describes how the system responds when a particle is added at time zero and removed at time @xmath7 .",
    "its imaginary time counterpart , the thermal green s function @xmath8\\bigr\\rangle\\:,\\ ] ] is not so clearly physically motivated .",
    "its main advantages are its mathematical elegance and computational ease .",
    "further , since it is defined in terms of the time ordering operator @xmath9 , @xmath10 admits a diagrammatic expansion via wick s theorem .",
    "moreover , whereas the retarded green s function @xmath11 is aperiodic in @xmath7 ( it has a lone discontinuity at @xmath12 ) , the temperature green s function is periodic in @xmath13 with period @xmath14 .",
    "the two green s functions have fourier representations : the first a fourier transform @xmath15 and the second , as a consequence of its periodicity , a fourier series @xmath16 which , in eq .",
    "( [ fourier - temperature ] ) , we have recast as a sum over the matsubara frequencies @xmath17 of some new fourier component @xmath18 .    the formal connection between the real and imaginary time formalisms is the following : there exists a unique function @xmath19 with asymptotic form @xmath20 which takes on the values of the fourier components of the temperature green s function at matsubara points on the imaginary axis @xmath21 and gives the fourier transform of the retarded green s function just above the real axis @xmath22 .",
    "that is , eqs .",
    "( [ fourier - retarded ] ) and ( [ fourier - temperature ] ) can be written as @xmath23 and @xmath24 clearly , all the information one can potentially extract from these functions is contained in @xmath25 .",
    "the function @xmath25 has several interesting properties .",
    "first , it is analytic everywhere in the complex plane with the exception of the real axis ; this is a causality requirement .",
    "second , the value of @xmath25 in the upper and lower half planes is related by @xmath26 , which is a statement of the time reversal symmetry between the retarded and advanced green s functions .",
    "its immediate consequence is that the imaginary part of @xmath25 may be discontinuous across the real axis .",
    "it also implies that we need only know the function in either the upper or the lower half plane since the other is a conjugated reflection of the first .",
    "third , @xmath25 can be written as a stieltjes / hilbert transform @xmath27 where the spectral function , given by the magnitude of the discontinuity in @xmath25 across the real axis , viz .",
    "@xmath28 is non - negative and normalized to unity @xmath29    typically , we are working in the matsubara formalism and we calculate @xmath18 from its self - energy ( via @xmath30 ) which is in turn calculated from an approximate theory based on , e.g. , a diagrammatic expansion of the propagator . from here the route to real time dynamics is somewhat circuitous : @xmath31 ( 1 ) the first step is to analytically continue from the fourier components of the temperature green s function to construct @xmath25 . that this is possible , in principle , provided we know @xmath32 for an infinite set of points including the point at infinity , was proved by baym and mermin@xcite .",
    "( 2 ) supposing that the analytic continuation to the upper half plane can be found , we merely evaluate it along the real axis ( setting @xmath33 ) to get @xmath34 . ( 3 ) a fourier transform then recovers the real time response function .    in practice , however , we do not know the values of @xmath18 at an infinite number of points .",
    "moreover , even if we did , the theorem of baym and mermin shows only the existence of a function @xmath25 .",
    "there is no general method to perform the analytic continuation  hence the need for a procedure such as the pad .",
    "the pad method is based on the assumption that @xmath25 can be written as a rational polynomial or terminating continued fraction . since theories are most commonly specified by a choice of self - energy , the continued fraction form turns out to be the more useful , at least for investigating questions of a mathematical nature ( e.g. analytic structure ) .",
    "in particular , we shall find it helpful to consider @xmath25 ( in the upper half plane ) a continued fraction of jacobi form@xcite ( j - frac ) .",
    "that is , @xmath35 where the @xmath36 and @xmath37 are complex constants . by comparison with dyson s equation , eq .",
    "( [ dyson ] ) , we make the identification @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is just the free particle energy measured with respect to the chemical potential@xcite .",
    "then , we find that @xmath41 is itself a continued fraction @xmath42    the justification for this continued fraction form is a theorem due to wall and wetzel@xcite which assures us that a positive definite j - frac has a spectral representation with non - negative , integrable spectral weight and that it is analytic in the upper half complex plane  all the properties we know @xmath25 must have to be physically reasonable . by positive definite j - frac we mean a continued fraction in the form of eq .",
    "( [ j - frac ] ) satisfying @xmath43 and for which there exists a sequence of real numbers @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) such that @xmath46    there are two special cases worth mentioning .",
    "if the @xmath36 and @xmath37 are all real then the j - frac is positive definite and can be cast as a sum of simple poles@xcite @xmath47 with real , distinct energies @xmath48 and positive residues @xmath49 . the j - frac is also positive definite",
    "if the @xmath36 are real and none of the @xmath37 sits in the upper half complex plane ( eq .  ( [ pos - def ] )",
    "is satisfied by setting all @xmath50 ) , in which case the function is characterized by simple poles resting on or below the real axis . in the general case ,",
    "all the continued fraction coefficients have the potential to be complex , with the exception of @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath51 . since @xmath52 has no imaginary part , eq .",
    "( [ pos - def ] ) implies that the coefficient @xmath51 must always be real and positive .",
    "it is clear that by observing the values of the @xmath36 , @xmath37 coefficients , one can learn a great deal about the analytic properties of @xmath53 .",
    "for example , if some @xmath37 has a positive imaginary part ( and no @xmath54 for @xmath55 ) then @xmath53 may have a pole in the upper half plane  such a function would be noncausal and have negative spectral weight .",
    "( in fact , it is through such considerations that we are led to propose a method for testing the accuracy of a given analytic continuation via a pad . )    nonetheless , despite the usefulness of the continued fraction form , for computational purposes it is actually much easier to work with rational polynomials . conveniently , every terminating continued fraction is equivalent to a rational polynomial .",
    "for instance , a j - frac with @xmath56 stories , eq .",
    "( [ sigma - j - frac ] ) say , can be written as the ratio @xmath57 of two polynomials @xmath58 defined recursively by the formulas    [ inductive ] @xmath59 @xmath60    ( for @xmath61 ) with base cases    [ base ] @xmath62 @xmath63    writing out the leading order terms of @xmath64 and @xmath65    @xmath66    @xmath67    makes it clear that the polynomial @xmath64 is of order @xmath68 in @xmath69 while the polynomial @xmath65 is of order @xmath56 .",

    "@xmath51 is equal to the sum of the residues of the poles in the self - energy and as such it gives the high frequency asymptotic behaviour of the self - energy via @xmath84 .",
    "a necessary condition for positive definiteness is that @xmath51 be real and positive .",
    "we shall see that the convergence of @xmath85 to zero as a function of the number @xmath56 of poles in the pad fitting function can provide information on the quality of the fit and on the analytic structure of the true continuation @xmath25 .",

    "now , we let the self - energy , evaluated at the first @xmath77 matsubara frequencies according to the two schemes described above , serve as the input to the pad procedure . the resulting approximant @xmath70 yields a propagator @xmath121 with spectral function @xmath122 . the spectral function derived from the pad approximant is compared to that of the exact function using the logarithmic measure @xmath123 in practice we choose @xmath124 to be a small , but noninfinitesimal positive real quantity ( we use @xmath125 ) , which has the effect of introducing a slight artificial broadening to the @xmath126-function peaks of the spectral function .",
    "the results of this comparison ( for the @xmath107 component of the spectral function ) are presented in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) , where @xmath127 is plotted as a function of @xmath56 for different values of the random error @xmath128 and the systematic error @xmath129 ( and thus a larger @xmath130 corresponds to a smaller error ) .",
    "in each graph , a vertical dashed line marks the exact number of poles ( @xmath131 ) in the true self - energy .",
    "the most distinctive feature of both graphs is that , at high accuracy ( large @xmath130 ) , the @xmath127 curves exhibit a large step at the point @xmath132 . in the random error case ,",
    "the @xmath133 curve jumps by four decades , and this represents an improvement in the pad fit of nearly 40 orders of magnitude . in the systematic error case , the result is even more dramatic : the @xmath134 and @xmath133 curves jump by roughly four and seven decades , respectively .    at these large accuracies ,",
    "the only factor inhibiting the success of the pad approximants is the lack of a sufficient number of poles to reproduce the analytic structure of the true function .",
    "the large jump observed in the large @xmath130 curves marks the point , @xmath132 , at which the number of poles in the pad approximant exactly matches the required number , and for this and larger @xmath56 there is no difficulty in finding an excellent fit of the test function .",
    "in contrast , when the input points are known to relatively low accuracy , no such feature is observed , and instead the @xmath127 curves pass smoothly through @xmath135 .",
    "this makes clear that for self - energies calculated to 20 , 40 , or even 60 decimal digits of accuracy , the level of error in the input points is still the main obstacle to a successful pad fit .    the usual response to this situation is to increase the number of pad points in an attempt to overcome the intrinsic error limitations ( by making the system of equations more and more overcomplete ) .",
    "however , whatever advantage this additional information brings to the pad approximant is soon outweighed by the accompanying complications : when a rational polynomial of degree @xmath71 $ ] is used to fit a function with @xmath136 poles , @xmath137 zeros of the numerator must coincide with an equal number of zeros in the denominator in order to cancel the extraneous poles . as @xmath137 grows , it is less and less likely that this cancellation will be complete .",
    "a slight misplacement of zeros leads to ` defects ' in which the function moves between @xmath138 and @xmath139 in a small neighbourhood .",
    "moreover , it can not be predicted where these zero - zero pairs will appear@xcite . for the purposes of calculating a spectral function",
    ", they are of little consequence provided that they lie deep in the complex plane . however",
    ", when they are not so far removed from the real axis , they can distort the spectral function away from its proper shape . when they lie on or near the real axis",
    ", they can give rise to deep troughs of negative spectral weight and other spurious , non - physical features .",
    "the deterioration of the pad fit , as described above , is evident in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) in which many of the @xmath127 curves reach maxima at points @xmath140 and then quickly begin to fall off for larger @xmath56 .",
    "interestingly , this behaviour is much more pronounced in the systematic error case where such maxima occur for each curve . in the random error case ,",
    "the curves below some error threshold are essentially flat for all @xmath56 .",
    "the primary lesson that one should draw from these results is that the addition of pad points well beyond the required number is not a useful strategy for improving the pad fit .",
    "unless the exact analytic continuation is already known , there is no way to predict the value of @xmath141 .",
    "we believe that better results are achieved by fixing the number of pad points at @xmath142 ( giving rise to a @xmath143 $ ] rational polynomial ) and working towards increasing the accuracy with which those input points are calculated .",
    "even a small effort there can result in an improvement of several orders of magnitude in the fit . what to try when one does not know _ a  priori _",
    "what @xmath135 is discussed later in this paper .",
    "now consider figs .",
    "2(a ) through 2(d ) in which the spectral function of a pad approximant with 26 poles ( calculated by specifying the value of the self - energy at 52 matsubara frequencies ) is compared to the exact spectral function . in fig .",
    "2(a ) , the accuracy of the input points is given by @xmath144 ( random error ) , roughly the number of digits in a double precision fortran variable . despite the fact that the overall energy scale is correct , the details of the fit are quite poor . here , the effect of insufficient accuracy is to produce a washed out version of the spectral function which completely lacks fine structure . even at @xmath145 ( fig .",
    "2(b ) ) , corresponding to the number of digits available in the largest fortran data type , the pad inversion is only just beginning to distinguish the main peaks of the spectral function .",
    "figure  2(c ) shows the result for @xmath146 and fig .",
    "2(d ) the result for @xmath133 .",
    "notice that in fig .",
    "2(d ) , the fit is near perfect : even the smallest peaks have been reproduced faithfully .    in this example , with @xmath132 , the pad approximant provides a remarkable fit to the true function whenever the accuracy of the input points is better than @xmath147 .",
    "the difficulty in translating our success in this specific case to the general problem is that , in real applications , one has no way to judge when sufficient accuracy has been achieved .",
    "also , in most instances , the number of poles in the self - energy is unknown .    in what follows ,",
    "we hope to address these deficiencies .",
    "we begin by defining a logarithmic measure of the imaginary part of the j - frac coefficient @xmath51 : @xmath148 we argued in sect .",
    "iii that @xmath51 ought to be real and positive . in a pad calculation , however , it is real - valued only to within some small fraction which characterizes the numerical sensitivity of the matrix inversion .",
    "as we shall soon discover , the convergence of the imaginary part of @xmath51 to zero ( @xmath149 ) can be used ( 1 ) to determine when the threshold of accuracy for an exact fit has been reached and ( 2 ) to infer the value of @xmath135 if it is unknown .    in figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) , we plot @xmath150 as a function of @xmath56 for the random and systematic error cases .",
    "over each plot is superimposed a reference line given by eq .",
    "( [ dig - precision ] ) .",
    "what we observe is a set of @xmath150 curves that initially follow the reference line but later fan out , spaced according to their @xmath130 values .",
    "our claim is that these curves provide the quantitative measure of success of the pad approximant that has heretofore been lacking , the essential point being that the shape of the curves reveals the performance characteristics of the pad inversion in the various @xmath56 regimes .",
    "when @xmath151 , the accuracy of the pad approximant is matrix inversion dominated and the behaviour of @xmath150 is governed by @xmath152 .",
    "in this regime , the pad approximant has too few poles to fit the true function and thus the matrix inversion must judiciously arrange the available poles ( sometimes apportioning one pole to a region where there should be two or three ) to give the best possible fit . in the opposite limit , @xmath153 ,",
    "the accuracy of the pad approximant is input - point error dominated . in this regime , there are more than enough poles to perform an exact fit , but the proper placement of those poles and the determination of their residues is hampered by the finite accuracy to which the input points are known .",
    "we find this reflected in the @xmath150 curves which , for large @xmath56 , saturate at a value @xmath154 ( roughly ) .",
    "most interesting , though , is the behaviour of @xmath150 in the vicinity of @xmath132 where the @xmath150 curves in figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) first cross the reference line . in those plots",
    ", we see that the @xmath150 curves corresponding to small values of @xmath130 closely follow the reference line ( eq .",
    "( [ dig - precision ] ) ) until finite accuracy becomes a limiting factor .",
    "the curves then fall below the reference line and become more or less flat . as @xmath130 is increased , the @xmath56 coordinate at which a given @xmath150 curve first deviates from the reference line moves to the right until ( for some accuracy , @xmath155 say ) it coincides with @xmath135 . here , there is a sudden change in behaviour : all @xmath150 curves corresponding to accuracies @xmath156 cross the reference line at @xmath132 .",
    "such a crossing signals that there are now both sufficient poles in the approximant and sufficient accuracy on the input points to fit @xmath157 more or less exactly .",
    "we can verify this interpretation by appealing to figs .  1 and 2 which clearly show a large jump at @xmath135 for precisely the same curves that demonstrate a crossing in figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) .",
    "the results we have described are extremely general and do not dependent on the choice of test function .",
    "for example , we may replace eq .",
    "( [ t - matrix - sigma ] ) with the full non - self - consistent t - matrix self - energy @xmath158 here , the frequency sums can not be performed analytically@xcite and thus we do not have a closed form analytical expression for the self - energy .",
    "( thus , this is more representative of the usual situation in which the pad method might be applied . ) in this case , we know only that its analytic continuation has a finite number of poles along the real axis ( although we are able to predict analytically an upper bound for the number of poles ) .",

    "we find that the resulting plot of @xmath150 vs.  @xmath56 is identical to that of fig .",

    "( this is a consequence of the lifting of degeneracy in each @xmath166 component brought about by the renormalization @xmath167 . )",
    "we also find that the approximant spectral function compares well with increasing accuracy of the input points to the numerically exact spectral functions as calculated ( i ) by a non - pad method due to marsiglio et al .",
    "@xcite ( this non - pad method is of limited application since it requires the self - energy to have a very specific form , but for those cases where it is applicable , it can outperform the pad method ) , and ( ii ) by an exact partial fraction decomposition of the self energy @xcite that can be done to a very high accuracy ( say @xmath168 on all poles and residues ) .    finally , one interesting feature that could potentially be exploited is that for self - energy values calculated using the @xmath169 function expansion , the value of @xmath56 which gives the maximum value of @xmath150 roughly tracks @xmath141 ( cf .  figs .",
    "1(b ) and 3(b ) ) .",
    "the pad procedure is very sensitive to the numerical precision with which the matrix inversion is performed and to the intrinsic error on the input points .",
    "sufficient precision is difficult to achieve in traditional computer languages ( e.g.  c , fortran ) and so , in many instances , it may be necessary to make use of a symbolic computation package capable of supporting very large precision data types . likewise , sufficient accuracy is difficult to achieve without a sophisticated computational scheme ( e.g.  the @xmath169 function expansion ) that goes beyond a simple truncation of the matsubara frequency sums in the self - energy .",
    "the required level of precision and accuracy depends on the temperature @xmath170 , which controls the spacing of the matsubara points , and on the pole count @xmath135 .",
    "an insufficient level of accuracy leads to an approximant spectral function that lacks fine structural detail or , worse , one that exhibits spurious spikes or troughs of spectral weight .",
    "this poses a problem whenever we are interested in the presence of a specific feature in the spectral function ( e.g.   the onset of a normal state pseudogap ) . in that case , it is essential to have confidence in the quality of the pad result .",
    "we must be convinced that the observed feature is robust and not merely a by - product of insufficient accuracy .",
    "we have argued that simply adding more pad points can not compensate for too large an error on the input points . while there is a small set of @xmath56 values for which an increase in @xmath56 improves the fit , there is no known criterion that indicates when to stop adding points . without already knowing the exact result",
    ", one can not distinguish between the regime where additional points improve the fit ( @xmath171 ) and the regime where such points degrade it ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "instead , we recommend the use of a pad approximant function having the same number of poles as the function to be fit . the exact number of poles , when it is not known , can be determined from the crossing point in a @xmath150 vs.  @xmath56 plot .",
    "the crossing also indicates that a sufficient level of numerical accuracy in the input points has been acheived .",
    "there are several caveats to the procedure we have outlined .",
    "( 1 ) if the true green s function has a branch cut along the real axis arising from trancendental functions then no @xmath150 crossing will ever be observed , since a branch cut of that kind can only be represented by an infinity of poles ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "( 2 ) the self - energy of the green s function we are trying to reproduce must have the correct asymptotic form and must be analytic in , say , the upper half of the complex plane ; otherwise , the rational polynomial ( or continued fraction ) form of the approximant can not reproduce its analytic structure . ( 3 ) the pad method is often used to model a function that is smooth in some region of interest ( well away from its poles ) and such calculations are rarely performed with more than machine accuracy .",
    "our numerical analysis of the pad inversion , with its prediction of extremely high accuracy requirements , is not meant to invalidate these results .",
    "we have applied the pad method to the particularly difficult problem of reproducing the sharp peak structures characteristic of a spectral function whose green s function has its poles along the real axis . in that case , the poles lie in the region of interest . the precision and accuracy requirements of the pad inversion",
    "are greatly reduced if the poles of the green s function lie deep in the complex plane .",
    "finally , let us remember that the starting point for our new pad approach was the realization that the convergence of the continued fraction coefficients to ` allowed ' values can provide a criterion for judging the quality of a pad approximant , even if the analytic structure of the function we are trying to fit is unknown . in sect .",
    "iv , we demonstrated the utility of this idea using the @xmath174 coefficient .",
    "however , we know that there is much addtional information that can be extracted from the remaining continued fraction coefficients . in future , perhaps our analysis can be extended to include @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 , etc .",

    "it is often convenient to define _ partial _ occupation functions .",
