    "the development of reliable strategies for quantum communication and information transfer has gained , in these recent years , an increasing importance in the quantum information processing ( qip ) panorama .",
    "the reliable implementation of a quantum channel for the exchange and distribution of information is indeed central in many potential qip applications  @xcite .",
    "intuitively , one could think about a scenario in which the quantum channel and the processing device are two different entities which have to be _ interfaced _ at the right time of a given protocol .",
    "this implies the ability of switching on and off the interfacing interaction with sufficient degree of accuracy and a reliable control at the single - qubit level , which are very demanding requirements in general . on the other hand",
    ", the idea of exploiting collective interactions of intrinsically multipartite systems , governed by external potentials which globally address the entire register , has very recently encountered the interest of the qip community  @xcite .",
    "a global addressing scheme offers advantages in terms of controllability of the device and protection from the decoherence channels unavoidably opened by any sort of local external intervention .    inspired by the progresses performed in the design , coupling and management of bosonic nanostructures , which can behave quantum mechanically  @xcite , important efforts",
    "have been produced in order to better understand the role that multipartite systems of coupled bosons have in the transfer and propagation of quantum information  @xcite .",
    "the application of global addressing techniques to systems of continuous variable ( cv ) bosonic systems is appealing for a less demanding implementation of cv quantum information processing .    in this work , we re - consider the issue of entanglement generation in a chain of harmonic oscillators coupled through nearest - neighbor spring - like forces induced by an external potential which addressed the whole system .",
    "one of the points of interests in our analysis is the role played by counter - rotating terms ( present in the interaction hamiltonian ) in the entanglement generation process .",
    "this point , anticipated by the studies in  @xcite , is analyzed here by a change of perspective . instead of solving by brute force the dynamical equations ruling the evolution of the bosonic register , we look for a formal decomposition of the time evolution operator in terms of linear optics elements , following the successful route initiated in  @xcite .",
    "we believe that this alternative approach clarifies the entanglement dynamics within the register and provides a more transparent picture of the role of the counter - rotating terms in such a process .",
    "entanglement is found to be always present if the counter - rotating terms are included in the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "however , we find the degree of bipartite entanglement between the first and last oscillator to be very small ( a feature which is evident , despite it has not been stressed , in the analyses in  @xcite ) . in order to quantitatively improve the entanglement settled between the ends of an open chain , we design a strategy based on proper initialization of the register ( performed by locally acting on the state of the extremal oscillators only ) and global addressing , following the same lines depicted in quantum state transfer protocols  @xcite .",
    "we show how , physically , this improvement is possible because of the symmetry properties of the bosonic system .",
    "the reminder of the manuscript is organized as follows . in section  [ modello ]",
    "we introduce the interaction model here at hand .",
    "we discuss the technical tools used in order to derive effective decompositions of the time - evolution operator into linear optics operations .",
    "effective all - optical setups can be introduced , which provide a visual picture of the evolution of an @xmath0-element register and we give an explicit example for a simple case . in section  [ entanglement ] , the entanglement generated in an open chain is quantified by means of the corresponding equivalent decompositions .",
    "we show that , as long as only the quantum correlations generated by the counter - rotating terms alone are considered , _",
    "end - to - end _ entanglement in the chain is not favoured .",
    "strong quantum correlations , which never disappear , are found between the first and the second oscillator in the chain . on the other hand ,",
    "the entanglement between the first and the last oscillator is always very weak .",
    "a transparent physical interpretation of the time delay with which entanglement appears in the first - last oscillators subsystem is possible through the analysis of the corresponding all - optical setup .",
    "section  [ improving ] addresses a way to improve the results discussed in section  [ entanglement ] . by considering the physical system as a fictitious two - terminal quantum black box ,",
    "we show that simple local pre - squeezing of the first and last element of the channel allows us to obtain several interesting effects .",

    "we stress that there might be other , inequivalent ordering of coupler operations which diagonalize the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "the choices presented in figs .  [ pattern ] @xmath56 and @xmath58 allow us to write the interaction part of the chain hamiltonian in the special diagonal form corresponding to the association between oscillators and eigen - frequencies shown in the bottom part of fig .",
    "[ pattern ] .",
    "there , the set @xmath64 is written as @xmath65 with the subset @xmath66 arranged in increasing order of frequencies ( with @xmath67 )  @xcite .",
    "after the action of the collective coupler operator @xmath68 , which collects the pattern ( for a given @xmath0 ) discussed above , the total hamiltonian of the chain reads @xmath69+\\sum^{n-1}_{j=1}{\\cal e}^{n}_{j}(\\hat{o}^{n}_{j})^2 $ ] . here",
    ", @xmath70 is the new set of momentum quadrature operators determined by the application of the coupler operations to @xmath71 . by specializing the discussion to the odd number of oscillators , the next step in order to find",
    "the decomposition of @xmath72 is the introduction of proper operations ( acting on the elements of the register , oscillator @xmath49 exluded ) which balance the differences between @xmath41 and @xmath73 . in the case of even @xmath0",
    ", these operations would involve the entire set of oscillators , without exclusions , as the eigen - spectrum of @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) does not include the bare frequency @xmath41 .",
    "conceptually , this balancing is an important step as it would allow us to look at the register as a set of new non - interacting harmonic oscillators .",
    "it is immediate to recognize that this is possible through the use of single - oscillator squeezing @xmath76 $ ] , which realizes @xmath77 .",
    "we can thus formally write @xmath78 , where @xmath79}$ ] is the phase - space representation of a rotation operator of its angle @xmath80 and @xmath81 . by inverting the above relation",
    ", we find the formal expression @xmath82 analogously to the case of squeezing , the formal collective rotation involves all the oscillators but the one associated to the bare eigen - frequency @xmath41 , which again is a specific feature of the odd @xmath0 case .",
    "moreover , the rotations @xmath83 s contain the entire time dependence of @xmath72 .",
    "the balancing induced by the squeezing operations imposes , in general , time - independent conditions as it relates the squeezing parameters @xmath84 s to the elements of the set @xmath66 . on the contrary ,",
    "the formal identification of @xmath85 with @xmath86 imposes that the rotation angles @xmath80 s carry an explicit time dependence . as an example , we consider again @xmath36 , where we have that @xmath87 the decomposition eq .",
    "( [ decomposizione ] ) is a central result of our study .",
    "it allows us to provide a clear physical picture of the dynamics occurring within the linear chain , without explicitly solving the dynamical equations of motion of the oscillators  @xcite .",
    "indeed , once the explicit form of @xmath68 is found , one can straighforwardly infer the evolution of the oscillators configuration simply by considering proper squeezing and rotations .",
    "this is equivalent to designing formal interferometric setups which could be used for proof - of - principle experiments where , at least for a few elements , the effects of cr terms could be simulated and observed . motivated by these arguments , in fig .",
    "[ 3oscillatori ] we show the equivalent interferometer for @xmath36 .",
    "[ t ]    by inspection , we see that this equivalent configuration results in _ concatenated _ mach - zehnder interferometers where the oscillators involved are subject to different squeezing and rotation operations . in going from @xmath36 to @xmath88 ,",
    "the overall concatenated structure of the setup is preserved , with just more oscillators being involved .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath61 , whose equivalent all - optical setup turns out to be more complicated than the one corresponding to @xmath88 for instance , with squeezing and rotations involving the entire register , as already stressed .",
    "the intrinsic difference between the even and odd @xmath0 cases should now be more evident .",
    "the most relevant discrepancy is caused by the absence of the bare frequency @xmath41 from the spectrum of @xmath74 .",
    "the second issue which has to be discussed here in relation to eq .",
    "( [ decomposizione ] ) is the role of the cr terms .",
    "it is easy to be convinced that the version of @xmath17 where the cr terms are excluded would have a contribution having the form @xmath89 . now",
    "the @xmath22-part of the chain hamiltonian is also non - diagonal , with the same tridiagonal structure in the quadrature operators basis discussed in eq .",
    "( [ trid ] ) .",
    "therefore , the orthogonal transformation which diagonalizes @xmath19 ( and the corresponding pattern of bs s ) can be used in order to reduce the @xmath22-part as well , getting the same set of eigen - frequencies .",
    "the corresponding eigen - operators are superpositions of just the @xmath90 quadrature operators with the same numerical coefficients @xmath34 s appearing in @xmath91 s .",
    "this implies that , for the odd @xmath0 case , after the application of @xmath68 , we end up with @xmath92+\\sum^{n}_{j=2}{\\cal e}_{j}[(\\hat{o}^{n}_{j})^2+(\\hat{p}^{n}_{j})^2]$ ] , where @xmath93 .",
    "evidently , no squeezing is required in this case as the @xmath21 and @xmath22-parts of the hamiltonian are already balanced by the diagonalization procedure .",
    "thus , the corresponding time - evolution operation could be immediately reinterpreted as the tensorial product of formal rotation operators , one for each oscillator , showing that in this case the interferometric configurations sketched above are still valid : we only need to remove the squeezing operations .",
    "it should be clear , up to this stage , that the exchange of any information encoded in the elements of the bosonic register occurs entirely by means of the effective collective operation @xmath68 .",
    "the remainder of the decomposition we have found , indeed , involves single - element operations which do not mutually mix the oscillators .",
    "thus , by considering co - rotating terms only , we can see that the structure of @xmath68 , for a given @xmath0 , is unchanged .",
    "this observation paves the way to the following consideration : the removal of cr terms from @xmath17 prevents the spontaneous creation of excitations in the system . in terms of the equivalent all - optical setups , this means that by preparing the register in a classical initial state , no inter - oscillator entanglement has to be expected , in this case . indeed , in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that non - classicality at the inputs of a bs is a fundamental pre - requisite for the entanglement of its outputs . in presence of cr terms , the single - oscillator squeezing provides the necessary non - classicality for inter - oscillator entanglement .",
    "we will come back to this point later , when the entanglement generation is quantitatively addressed .",
    "it is worth comparing the decomposition in eq .",
    "( [ decomposizione ] ) with what has been found for a star - shaped bosonic configuration  @xcite .",
    "in an open linear chain , @xmath68 induces multi - body interactions between the element of the chain .",
    "in particular , from fig .  [ pattern ] we see that an exchange of information is always required between the first and last element in a chain , a feature which holds regardless of @xmath0  @xcite . in the star - shaped configuration , on the other hand",
    ", any exchange of information occurs via a preferential way passing through the central component  @xcite .",
    "in order to investigate the dynamics of the entanglement generated among the oscillators in an open chain , we concentrate on gaussian states and rely on the powerful tools provided by the variance matrix formalism . indeed ,",
    "the statistical properties of a gaussian state , _ i.e. _ a state whose characteristic function is gaussian , are entirely specified by the knowledge of its variance matrix . the variance matrix @xmath94 is defined as @xmath95 , where @xmath96 and , for convenience , we have adopted the ordering of the quadrature operators @xmath97 . throughout the paper , we assume that the gaussian peak of each oscillator is at the origin of the respective phase - space .",

    "the proportionality of the correlation matrix @xmath123 to the difference @xmath124 is important , in this analysis , and is in striking contrast with the inherent structure of the correlations between the end points of the chain .",

    "differently from what happens for an initially prepared vacuum state , when the ending elements are initially squeezed and for @xmath183 , all the elements @xmath184 simultaneously become very close to zero ( @xmath185 with @xmath186 ) , whereas @xmath187 ( at that value of @xmath166 ) becomes diagonal with matrix elements in the range of @xmath188 .",
    "this accounts for the improvement of the entanglement settled between @xmath49 and @xmath121 with , correspondingly , @xmath189 .",
    "the subsystem @xmath190 has been _ tagged _ by the single - element pre - squeezing to be the preferential pair of oscillators for the entanglement generation within the chain .",
    "it is worth stressing that this _ tagging _ procedure is possible in virtue of the symmetry existing between the ending elements of the open chain .",
    "an analogous conclusion has been drawn in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a _ totally symmetric _ @xmath0-body cv system has been considered in order to point out the possibility of a unitary localization of the entanglement . in our case , however , the cv chain exhibits a degree of symmetry which is inferior to the one treated in ref .",
    "different pairs of oscillators are characterized by different local and correlation properties , which makes the problem approached in this paper intrinsically different from the one in  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we have shown that entanglement localization is possible with a lower degree of symmetry , which is _ per se _ an interesting point .",
    "we can generalize the choice for the initial variance matrix in the tagging procedure to the case of @xmath0 oscillators by considering @xmath191 .",
    "again , an explicit calculation for the logarithmic negativity can be performed , which leads to the plots shown in figs .",
    "[ ent4sq ] @xmath56 and @xmath57 , for the cases @xmath61 and @xmath55 . in fig .",
    "[ ent4sq ] * ( b ) * , the time - range has been restricted to the interesting region where @xmath192 $ ] in order to make the plot more transparent .",
    "it is evident that there is always at least one value of @xmath166 at which the end - to - end entanglement dominates , making the tagging procedure effective .",
    "the amount of pre - required single - oscillator squeezing slightly depends on the dimension of the register and the plots in this paper show those values of @xmath177 at which we have found a good trade - off between the degree of entanglement and the effectiveness of the tagging strategy .",
    "as we have stressed before , the even and odd cases are inherently different , as also witnessed by the fact that the value of @xmath166 corresponding to an optimized tagging operation is larger for @xmath61 than for @xmath88 . at the same time ,",
    "@xmath193 , for @xmath61 , is roughly proportional to @xmath177 , while @xmath194 for all the odd @xmath0 cases we have checked .",
    "we have addressed the problem of long - haul entanglement creation in a register of bosons interacting via a global potential .",
    "the dynamics of entanglement can be clearly tracked via the effective decomposition of the time propagator in terms of simple linear optics elements as rotators , single - oscillator squeezers and couplers .",
    "this approach has allowed us to spot out a series of interesting features , characterizing the evolution of the quantum correlations settled among the elements of the register . as a result",
    ", we have been able to relate the conceptual role played by the cr terms in the entanglement generation process to effective squeezing operations on the elements of the register .",
    "the usefulness of this analysis is also witnessed by the design of a tagging protocol for the improvement of the end - to - end entanglement and the simultaneous reduction of any other @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) quantum correlation in an chain of @xmath0 elements .",
    "no local control over the central section is required : a proper preparation of the extremal oscillators and a collective interaction are sufficient to achieve the task .",
    "we believe this formal approach could be used in order to clarify other aspects related to the role played by the cr terms in entanglement creation , an issue which is certainly relevant especially in many problems of solid - state physics .",
