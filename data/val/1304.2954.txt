    "this allows to perform arbitrary quantum gates in this system .",
    "ultimate control of a quantum system can be demonstrated in experiment by state tomography , i.e. , gaining full information of a quantum state , in general described by a density matrix . since the density matrix is hermitian with trace 1 , it can can be described by @xmath1 real parameters for a @xmath2-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "therefore , from repeated projection of the unknown quantum state onto at least @xmath1 known states , the density matrix can be reconstructed from experimental data .",
    "a higher number of different measurements can increase the precision.@xcite the experimental values of measurements are not perfect due to external noise and because they are not performed infinitely often .",

    "the measurements we propose are projections on one - dimensional subspaces of the four - dimensional hilbert space , and thus joint measurements on the full two - qubit space .",

    "we consider a double quantum dot with two electrons taking only the lowest ( orbital ) energy level in each dot into account . therefore , due to the antisymmetry of the wave function ( pauli principle ) , we have a six - dimensional hilbert space since we have one state with both electrons in the left dot , one state with two electrons in the right dot , and a four - dimensional space with one electron per dot",
    ". we will denote charge states with @xmath3 electron in the left and @xmath4 electrons in the right dot with @xmath5 .",
    "the hamiltonian , taking into account the difference between the energy levels , @xmath6 , the coulomb penalty for both electrons in the same dot , @xmath7 , and the hopping matrix element between the dots , @xmath8 , reads @xmath9 where the operators of the occupation number in the dots , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are given by @xmath12 .",
    "we will consider the states with charge configuration ( 1,1 ) as logical hilbert space and regard the electron spin in each dot as a quantum bit .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give a scheme for determining an unknown density matrix of this two - qubit space . in the limit",
    "@xmath13 the ( 1,1 ) states are approximately decoupled from the states with charge configuration ( 2,0 ) and ( 0,2 ) . for this case the effective hamiltonian for ( 1,1 ) states can be obtained by applying a schrieffer - wolff transformation , @xcite @xmath14 with @xmath15 , and where @xmath16 is the vector of pauli matrices for the electron spin in dot @xmath17 .",
    "note that @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 times the projection operator @xmath20 on the spin singlet @xmath21 because only an antisymmetric state can couple to the ( 0,2 ) and to the ( 2,0 ) space .",

    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "different directions in the magnetic field in the left and the right quantum dot can additionally induce an avoided crossing between @xmath27 and @xmath26 .",
    "projective measurements on the two - qubit space are done by charge measurements after a spin - to - charge conversion,@xcite which we describe in the following .",
    "for @xmath42 the four lowest energy levels belong to states with charge configuration ( 1,1 ) , which constitute the logical subspace of the system .",
    "the starting point is an arbitrary state @xmath46 in this logical subspace and @xmath42 . by changing gate voltages",
    ", @xmath6 can be increased to a value higher than @xmath7 , modifying the spectrum to a situation where the state @xmath47 is the ground state of the system , see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ( a ) . performing this varying of @xmath6 backwards in time would map the ( 0,2 ) charge state on one specific state in the logical subspace , @xmath48 .",
    "the forward procedure thus converts the @xmath48 amount of @xmath46 , given by @xmath49 , to the ( 0,2 ) charge state and the remaining contributions of @xmath46 are still in charge configuration ( 1,1 ) . therefore , measuring a charge state ( 0,2 ) , corresponds to a projection onto the state @xmath48 in the logical subspace .",

    "assuming we are in the situation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ( a ) , then a slow change of @xmath6 from 0 to a value higher than @xmath7 would be an adiabatic transition of the @xmath43 state to the ( 0,2 ) state .",
    "if we increase @xmath6 slowly from 0 up to a value below the avoided crossing between @xmath26 and @xmath43 and then proceed fast through this avoided crossing , the charge readout effectively projects onto the state @xmath28 .",
    "an overall fast transition yiels a projection onto @xmath26 .",
    "we will use this three different kinds of projection in our scheme for state tomography in sec .",
    "[ sec : quorum ] . in the state - tomography experiment for the @xmath50 qubits@xcite the projections onto @xmath28 and onto @xmath26 were used . to allow projections onto other than the three states described so far",

    "more complicated transitions are possible , they are described by a landau - zener transition.@xcite state preparation is done in the opposite direction by converting the ( 0,2 ) state in a well - defined ( 1,1 ) charge state .",
    "it has been shown that the exchange interaction together with arbitrary single - qubit rotations allows for universal quantum computing,@xcite i.e. , every unitary operation can be constructed from these elementary gates .",
    "to achieve full control on a single qubit , a tunable magnetic field in one direction is necessary with individual tuning for each dot .",
    "additionally , rotations on the bloch sphere around another axis than the @xmath29-axis must be possible , which can be done using esr .",
    "this requires an oscillating magnetic field orthogonal to the axis of the time - independent magnetic field .",
    "the frequency of the oscillation is given by the rabi frequency of the constant field .",
    "as a sufficiently strong high - frequency magnetic field is hard to realize experimentally , brunner _ _ et al.__@xcite used an inhomogeneous magnetic field and achieved an effective time - dependence in the zeeman hamiltonian by applying an ac voltage shifting the electron back and forth . due to an offset in zeeman energy between dots it was possible to perform esr on each of the dots separately .",
    "since exchange interaction was performed as well , in this double dot sample , operations allowing for full control on the two - qubit space have been demonstrated experimentally .",
    "we want to find a scheme for state tomography for the two - qubit space .",
    "this means the scheme has to provide the full information of the density matrix @xmath51 , which is a hermitian @xmath52 matrix with trace 1 .",
    "therefore , we need at least 15 different measurements to determine the 15 real parameters describing @xmath51 . in the space of @xmath52 matrices",
    "we can introduce the scalar product @xmath53 and the basis @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are pauli matrices for the first or second spin , and @xmath57 . note that this basis is orthonormal with respect to @xmath58 because @xmath59 .",

    "estimations for @xmath65 have to be acquired from experimental data . in the physical setup we consider in this paper ,",
    "measurements are done by measuring the charge state after increasing the detuning @xmath6 .",
    "this converts a state from the logical spin space ( qubit space ) with charge configuration ( 1,1 ) to a ( 0,2 ) charge state . in the previous section we found conditions under which this leads to a projective measurement on either @xmath28 , @xmath26 , or @xmath43 .",
    "we assume that universal quantum gates are feasible and therefore , any other state could have been mapped by a unitary operation onto the state which is converted to the ( 0,2 ) charge state .",
    "therefore , spin - to - charge conversion and universal quantum gates allow for a projection onto an arbitrary state @xmath66 .",
    "each measurement within the tomography scheme will project onto a state @xmath67 and thus yields @xmath68 .",

    "it was shown that the mutually unbiased bases represent an optimal set to determine @xmath51 in the sense of minimizing the statistical error.@xcite for the projective measurement by the spin - to - charge conversion , which we consider in this paper , the situation is slightly different since every projection is done by another measurement . in particular , it is not necessary to measure all 20 probabilities ; it suffices to perform the projective measurement for three states out of the four states in each of the five bases , providing a basis in the 15 dimensional matrix space , and consequently a minimal set of projectors .",
