    "the birth of the hot big - bang model dates back to the work of gamow and his collaborators in the 1940s .",
    "the emergence of the hot big - bang cosmology began in 1964 with the discovery of the microwave background radiation . by the 1970s ,",
    "the black - body character of the microwave background radiation had been established and the success of big - bang nucleosynthesis demonstrated , and the hot big - bang was being referred to as the standard cosmology .",
    "today , it is universally accepted and provides an accounting of the universe from a fraction of a second after the beginning , when the universe was a hot , smooth soup of quarks and leptons to the present , some @xmath0 later .",
    "together with the standard model of particle physics and ideas about the unification of the forces , it provides a firm foundation for speculations about the earliest moments of creation .",
    "the standard cosmology rests upon three strong observational pillars : the expansion of the universe ; the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cbr ) ; and the abundance pattern of the light elements , d , @xmath1he , @xmath2he , and @xmath3li , produced seconds after the bang ( see e.g. , peebles et al , 1991 ; or turner & tyson , 1999 ) . in its success ,",
    "it has raised new , more fundamental questions : the matter / antimatter asymmetry , the origin of the smoothness and flatness of the universe , the nature and origin of the primeval density inhomogeneities that seeded all the structure in the universe , the quantity and composition of the dark matter that holds the universe together , and the nature of the big - bang event itself .",
    "this has motivated the search for a more expansive cosmological theory .    in the 1980s ,",
    "born of the inner space / outer space connection , a new paradigm emerged , one deeply rooted in fundamental physics with the potential to extend our understanding of the universe back to @xmath4 and to address the fundamental questions poised by the hot big - bang model .",
    "that paradigm , known as inflation + cold dark matter , holds that most of the dark matter consists of slowly moving elementary particles ( cold dark matter ) , that the universe is flat and that the density perturbations that seeded all the structure seen today arose from quantum mechanical fluctuations on scales of @xmath5 or smaller .",
    "it took awhile for the observers and experimentalists to take this theory seriously enough to try to disprove it , and in the 1990s it began to be tested in a serious way .",
    "this could prove to be a watershed year in cosmology , as important as 1964 , when the cbr was discovered .",
    "the crucial new data include a precision measurement of the density of ordinary matter and of the total amount of matter , both derived from a measurement of the primeval deuterium abundance and the theory of bbn ; fine - scale ( down to @xmath6 ) measurements of the anisotropy of the cbr ; and a measurement of the deceleration of the universe based upon distance measurements of type ia supernovae ( sne1a ) out to redshift of close to unity .    together , these measurements , which are harbingers for the precision era of cosmology that is coming , provide the first plausible , complete accounting of the matter / energy density in the universe and evidence that the primeval density perturbations arose from quantum fluctuations during inflation .",
    "in addition , there exists a large body of cosmological data  from measurements of large - scale structure to the evolution of galaxies and clusters  that support the cold dark matter theory of structure formation .",
    "the accounting of matter and energy goes like this ( in units of the critical density for @xmath7 ) : light neutrinos , at least 0.3% ; bright stars and related material , 0.5% ; baryons , 5% ; cold dark matter , 35% ; and vacuum energy ( or something similar ) , 60% ; for a total equalling the critical density ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : omega_sum ] ) .",
    "the recently measured primeval deuterium abundance ( burles & tytler , 1998a , b ) and the theory of big - bang nucleosynthesis accurately determine the baryon density ( schramm & turner , 1998 ) , @xmath8 ( for @xmath9 ) ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : bbn ] . using the cluster baryon fraction , determined from x - ray measurements ( evrard , 1996 ) and sz measurements ( carlstrom , 1999 ) , @xmath10 , and assuming that clusters provide a fair sample of matter in the universe , @xmath11 , it follows that @xmath12 .    that @xmath13 is strong , almost incontrovertible , evidence for nonbaryonic dark matter ; the leading particle candidates are axions , neutralinos and neutrinos .",
    "the recent evidence for neutrino oscillations , based upon atmospheric neutrino data presented by the superkamiokande collaboration , indicates that neutrinos contribute at least as much mass as bright stars ( wow ! ) ; the failure of the , top - down , hot dark matter scenario of structure formation restricts the contribution of neutrinos to be less than about 20% of the critical density ( see e.g. , dodelson et al , 1996 ) . because relic axions and neutralinos behave like cold dark matter ( i.e. , move slowly ) , they are the prime particle dark matter candidates .",
    "the position of the first acoustic peak in the angular power spectrum of temperature fluctuations of the cbr is a sensitive indicator of the curvature of the universe : @xmath14 , where @xmath15 .",
    "cbr anisotropy measurements now span multipole number @xmath16 to around @xmath17 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cbr_today ] ) ; while the data do not yet speak definitively , it is clear that @xmath18 is preferred .",
    "several experiments ( python v , maxima , and qmat ) have new results around @xmath19 , and should be reporting them soon . ultimately , the map ( launch in 2000 ) and planck ( launch in 2007 ) satellites will cover @xmath16 to @xmath20 with precision limited essentially by sampling variance , and should determine @xmath21 to a precision of 1% or better .    the same angular power spectrum that indicates @xmath22 also provides evidence that the primeval density perturbations are of the kind predicted by inflation . the inflation - produced gaussian curvature fluctuations lead to an angular power spectrum with a series of well defined acoustic peaks . while the data at best define the first peak , they are good enough to exclude many models where the density perturbations are isocurvature ( e.g. , cosmic strings and textures ) : in these models the predicted spectrum is devoid of acoustic peaks ( allen et al , 1997 ; pen et al , 1997 ) .",
    "the oldest approach to determining @xmath21 is by measuring the deceleration of the expansion .",
    "sandage s deceleration parameter , @xmath23 $ ] , depends upon both @xmath21 and the equation of state . because distant objects are seen at an earlier epoch , by measuring the ( luminosity ) distance to objects as a function of redshift the deceleration of the universe can be determined .",
    "( the idea is basically this : if the universe is slowing down , distant objects should be moving faster than predicted by hubble s law , @xmath24 . )",
    "accurate distance measurements to some fifty supernovae of type 1a ( sne1a ) carried out by two groups ( riess et al , 1998 ; perlmutter et al , 1998 ) indicate that the universe is speeding up , not slowing down ( i.e. , @xmath25 ) .",
    "the simplest explanation is a cosmological constant , with @xmath26 .",
    "this result fits neatly with the cbr determination that @xmath27 and dynamical measures that indicate @xmath28 : the `` missing energy '' exists in a smooth component that can not clump and thus is not found in clusters of galaxies .",
    "while the evidence for inflation + cold dark matter is not definitive and we should be cautious , 1998 could well mark a turning point in cosmology as important as 1964 .",
    "recall , after the discovery of the cbr it took a decade or more to firmly establish the cosmological origin of the cbr and the hot big - bang cosmology as the standard cosmology .",
    "inflation has revolutionized the way cosmologists view the universe and provides the current working hypothesis for extending the standard cosmology to much earlier times .",
    "it explains how a region of size much , much greater than our hubble volume could have become smooth and flat without recourse to special initial conditions ( guth 1981 ) , as well as the origin of the density inhomogeneities needed to seed structure ( hawking , 1982 ; starobinsky , 1982 ; guth & pi , 1982 ; and bardeen et al , 1983 ) .",
    "inflation is based upon well defined , albeit speculative physics  the semi - classical evolution of a weakly coupled scalar field  and this physics may well be connected to the unification of the particles and forces of nature .",
    "it would be nice if there were a standard model of inflation , but there is nt .",
    "what is important , is that almost all inflationary models make three very testable predictions : flat universe , nearly scale - invariant spectrum of gaussian density perturbations , and nearly scale - invariant spectrum of gravitational waves .",
    "these three predictions allow the inflationary paradigm to be decisively tested .",
    "while the gravitational waves are an extremely important and challenging test , i do not have space to mention them again here ( see e.g. , turner 1997a ) .",
    "the tremendous expansion that occurs during inflation is key to its beneficial effects and robust predictions : a small , subhorizon - sized bit of the universe can grow large enough to encompass the entire observable universe and much more . because all that we can see today was once so extraordinarily small , it began flat and smooth .",
    "this is unaffected by the expansion since then and so the hubble radius today is much , much smaller than the curvature radius , implying @xmath29 .",
    "lastly , the tremendous expansion stretches quantum fluctuations on truly microscopic scales ( @xmath30 ) to astrophysical scales ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the curvature perturbations created by inflation are characterized by two important features : 1 ) they are almost scale - invariant , which refers to the fluctuations in the gravitational potential being independent of scale  and not the density perturbations themselves ; 2 ) because they arise from fluctuations in an essentially noninteracting quantum field , their statistical properties are that of a gaussian random field .    scale invariance specifies the dependence of the spectrum of density perturbations upon scale .",
    "the normalization ( overall amplitude ) depends upon the specific inflationary model ( i.e. , scalar - field potential ) . ignoring numerical factors for the moment",
    ", the fluctuation amplitude is given by : @xmath32 .",
    "( the amplitude of the density perturbation on a given scale at horizon crossing is equal to the fluctuation in the gravitational potential @xmath33 . ) to be consistent with the cobe measurement of cbr anisotropy on the @xmath34 scale , @xmath33 must be around @xmath35 .",
    "not only did cobe produce the first evidence for the existence of the density perturbations that seeded all structure ( smoot et al , 1992 ) , but also , for a theory like inflation that predicts the shape of the spectrum of density perturbations , it provides the overall normalization that fixes the amplitude of density perturbations on all scales .",
    "the cobe normalization began precision testing of inflation .",
    "while we do nt know what the cold dark matter consists of , there is overwhelming evidence that it must be there .",
    "( generically , cold dark matter refers to particles that comprise the bulk of the matter density , move very slowly , interact feebly with ordinary matter ( baryons ) and are not comprised of ordinary matter . )",
    "the biggest surprise in cosmology that i can imagine is the nonexistence of cold dark matter .",
    "here is a brief summary of the most compelling evidence for cold dark matter :    * for more than a decade there has been growing evidence that the total amount of matter is significantly greater than what baryons can account for . today",
    ", the discrepancy is about a factor of eight : @xmath36 and @xmath37 . unless bbn is grossly misleading us and/or determinations of the matter density are way off",
    ", most of the matter must be nonbaryonic .",
    "( the discovery of dark energy does nothing to change this fact ; it explains the discrepancy between the matter density , @xmath38 , inferred from matter that clusters , and the total density , @xmath39 , inferred from cbr anisotropy . )",
    "* we now know that galaxies formed at redshifts of order 2 to 4 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr ] ) , that clusters formed at redshifts of 1 or less and that superclusters are forming today",
    ". that is , structure formed from the bottom up , as predicted if the nonbaryonic matter is cold .",
    "( hot dark matter leads to a top - down sequence of structure formation ; white , frenk , and davis , 1983 . )",
    "* the cold dark matter model of structure formation is consistent with an enormous body of data : cbr anisotropy , large - scale structure , abundance of clusters , the clustering of galaxies and clusters , the evolution of clusters and galaxies and their clustering , the structure of the lyman-@xmath40 forest , and a host of other data . *",
    "the only plausible candidate for the bulk of the dark matter in the halo of own galaxy is cold dark matter particles .",
    "the last - chance baryonic candidate , dark stars or machos , can account for only about half the mass of the halo and probably much less .",
    "this follows from the fact the microlensing rates toward the magellanic clouds , which are about 30% of that expected if the halo were comprised entirely of machos , and the growing evidence that the magellanic lenses are in the clouds themselves or other nonhalo components of the galaxy .",
    "the two leading particle candidates for cold dark matter are the axion and the neutralino .",
    "both are well motivated by fundamental physics concerns and both have a predicted relic abundance that is comparable to the critical density .",
    "there are other `` dark horse '' candidates including primordial black holes and superheavy relic particles , which should not be forgotten ( kolb , 1999 ) .",
    "as far as cosmological infrastructure goes , they would be every bit as good as axions and neutralinos .",
    "as we look forward to the abundance ( avalanche ! ) of high - quality observations that will test inflation + cdm , we have to make sure the predictions of the theory match the precision of the data . in so doing , cdm",
    "+ inflation becomes a ten ( or more ) parameter theory . for astrophysicists , and especially cosmologists ,",
    "this is daunting , as it may seem that a ten - parameter theory can be made to fit any set of observations .",
    "this is not the case when one has the quality and quantity of data that will be coming .",
    "the standard model of particle physics offers an excellent example : it is a nineteen - parameter theory and because of the high - quality of data from experiments at fermilab s tevatron , slac s slc , cern s lep and other facilities it has been rigorously tested and the parameters measured to a precision of better than 1% in some cases . my worry as an inflationist is not that many different sets of parameters will fit the upcoming data , but rather that no set will !    in fact , the ten parameters of cdm + inflation are an opportunity rather than a curse : because the parameters depend upon the underlying inflationary model and fundamental aspects of the universe , we have the very real possibility of learning much about the universe and inflation .",
    "the ten parameters can be organized into two groups : cosmological and dark - matter ( dodelson et al , 1996 ) .    _ cosmological parameters _    1 .",

    "@xmath60 , the fraction of critical density in neutrinos ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "while the hot dark matter theory of structure formation is not viable , it is possible that a small fraction of the matter density exists in the form of neutrinos .",
    "further , small  but nonzero  neutrino masses are a generic prediction of theories that unify the strong , weak and electromagnetic interactions  and there is evidence that the at least one of the neutrino species has a mass of greater than about 0.1ev , based upon the deficit of atmospheric muon neutrinos ( fukuda et al , 1998 ) .",

    "the amount of radiation controls when the universe became matter dominated and thus affects the present spectrum of density inhomogeneity .",
    "as mentioned , the parameters involving density and gravity - wave perturbations depend directly upon the inflationary potential .",
    "in particular , they can be expressed in terms of the potential and its first three derivatives :    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the inflationary potential , prime denotes @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is the value of the scalar potential when the present horizon scale crossed outside the horizon during inflation .",
    "if one can measure @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath72 , one can recover the value of the potential and its first two derivatives ( see e.g. , turner 1993 ; lidsey et al , 1997 ) @xmath73\\ , v _ * /{m_{\\rm pl}}^2 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sign of @xmath74 is indeterminate ( under the redefinition @xmath75 the sign changes ) . if , in addition , the gravity - wave spectral index can also be measured the consistency relation , @xmath76 , can be used to test inflation .",

    "this indicates that inflation must involve energies much smaller than the planck scale .",
    "( to be more precise , inflation could have begun at a much higher energy scale , but the portion of inflation relevant for us , i.e. , the last 60 or so e - folds , occurred at an energy scale much smaller than the planck energy . )    finally , it should be noted that the ` tensor tilt , ' deviation of @xmath57 from 0 , and the ` scalar tilt , ' deviation of @xmath78 from zero , are not in general equal ; they differ by the rate of change of the steepness .",
    "the tensor tilt and the ratio @xmath77 are related : @xmath82 , which provides a consistency test of inflation .",
    "a useful way to organize the different cdm models is by their dark - matter content ; within each cdm family , the cosmological parameters vary .",
    "one classification is ( dodelson et al , 1996 ) :    1 .",
    "scdm ( for simple ) : only cdm and baryons ; no additional radiation ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the original standard cdm is a member of this family ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 ) , but is now ruled out ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cdm_sum ] ) .",

    "figure [ fig : cdm_sum ] summarizes the viability of these different cdm models , based upon cbr measurements and current determinations of the present power spectrum of inhomogeneity derived from redshift surveys ( see fig .  [ fig : pd ] ) .",
    "scdm is only viable for low values of the hubble constant ( less than @xmath93 ) and/or significant tilt ( deviation from scale invariance ) ; the region of viability for @xmath87cdm is similar to scdm , but shifted to larger values of the hubble constant ( as large as @xmath94 ) .",
