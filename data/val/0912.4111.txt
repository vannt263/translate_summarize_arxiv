    "transition radiation is produced when a relativistic particle traverses an inhomogeneous medium .",
    "such radiation has a number of remarkable properties and at present it has found many important applications . in particular , optical transition radiation from metallic targets is widely used for the measurement of transverse size , divergence and energy of electron and proton beams ( see , e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the intensity of the transition radiation can be increased considerably by using the interference effects in periodic structures ( for a review see refs .",

    "the considerations of concrete processes , such as diffraction radiation mkrtdr , parametric x - radiation @xcite , channeling radiation mkrt86 , electron - positron pair creation by high - energy photons mkrt02 , bremsstrahlung of high - energy electrons @xcite , have shown that the external fields can essentially change the angular - frequency characteristics of the radiation intensities .",
    "recently there has been broad interest in compact crystalline undulators with periodically deformed crystallographic planes as an efficient source of high energy photons koro98 ( for a review with a more complete list of references see koro04 ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have considered the x - ray transition radiation from ultrarelativistic electrons in an ultrasonic superlattice excited in fused quartz plate . the radiation from a charged particle for a semi - infinite laminated medium has been recently discussed in @xcite .",
    "the present paper deals with the optical transition radiation from relativistic electrons in a plate in presence  of ultrasonic vibrations .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we evaluate the vector potential for the electromagnetic field in the quasi - classical approximation .",
    "the radiation intensity is investigated in section sec : radiation .",
    "special cases of the general formula are considered . in section [ sec : numeric ] we present the results of the numerical evaluation of the radiation intensity for the case of a plate made of fused quartz .",

    "otherwise , cherenkov radiation emitted inside the plate will be reflected from the boundary .",
    "formula ( [ iom0 ] ) gives the quasi - classical approximation for the radiation intensity emitted by a charge flying into a dielectric plate in the direction of normal to its surface . the exact expression for the radiation intensity in this problem",

    "for this value of the refractive index cherenkov radiation emitted in the plate is completely reflected from the boundary ( see the condition given above ) . for a transparent material in the over - threshold case and under the condition @xmath81",

    "now , for simplicity considering the case @xmath72 , it can be seen that for a relativistic particle with @xmath84 the radiation intensity near the cherenkov peaks , corresponding to @xmath85 , is well approximated by formula ( [ iom0 ] ) ( we have checked this both analytically and numerically ( see below ) for fused quartz with the dispersion law given in the next section ) .",
    "the cherenkov peaks coincide with the @xmath64 peaks in the presence of the acoustic wave .",
    "as it follows from ( [ iom1 ] ) , the height of the peaks is reduced by the factor @xmath86 .",
    "for the parameters of the acoustic wave taken in accordance with @xmath87 , @xmath88 , where @xmath89 @xmath90 are the zeros of the function @xmath91 , the corresponding radiation intensity vanishes . in the absence of acoustic waves",
    "the frequency range in which the peaks appear is determined by the condition @xmath92 .",
    "when the acoustic waves are present the corresponding condition takes the form @xmath93 .",
    "the latter condition is less restrictive . in particular",
    ", we can have a situation when in the absence of the acoustic waves there are no peaks in a given frequency range and they appear in the presence of acoustic waves .",
    "examples for this type of situation will be given below .    in the limit @xmath94 , by using the formula @xmath95 , for the spectral - angular density of the radiation energy per unit length we find@xmath96as we see , in this case the radiation for a given @xmath35 has discrete spectrum determined by the relation    @xmath97    this relation directly follows from the periodicity properties of the problem",
    ". the spectral distribution of the radiation intensity is obtained from ( [ iominf ] ) by the integration over @xmath35 and in the case @xmath98 coincides with the result given in termik .    in the discussion above we have assumed that the particle moves with constant velocity along the direction perpendicular to the plate . in reality",
    "the particle trajectory will be affected by the interaction with atoms of medium ( multiple scattering ) . it is known ( see , for example , @xcite ) that the multiple scattering does not suppress the x - ray transition radiation .",
    "moreover , it leads to the widening of the frequency range .",
    "an exact treatment for the influence of the multiple scattering on the intensity of radiation in the problem under consideration requires a separate consideration .",
    "we expect that the multiple scattering will result in the broadening of the radiation angular distribution for the peaks described above . by taking into account that the change in the medium density induced by acoustic wave is small , in the first approximation we can estimate this broadening by using the corresponding results for cherenkov radiation in a homogeneous medium given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this way , for the ratio of the angular broadening due to the multiple scattering to the angular width of the peaks estimated above we find @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is defined by the mean squared angle of multiple scattering per unit length of the particle trajectory .",
    "note that the characteristics of the peaks discussed above are determined by the relative velocity @xmath101 and for @xmath102 they are relatively unsensitive to the energy of the particle , whereas the parameter @xmath103 is decreasing with increasing energy .",
    "hence , by increasing the particle energy we can reduce the relative role of the effects related to the multiple scattering .",
    "here we are interested in the optical transition radiation . for the numerical evaluation of the radiation intensity the material of the plate should be specified .",
    "we assume that the plate is made of fused quartz .",
    "for the dielectric permittivity of fused quartz we use the sellmeier dispersion formula@xmath104where @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath30 is the wavelength of the radiation measured in micrometers .",
    "formula ( [ sellmeier ] ) well describes the dispersion properties of fused quartz in the range @xmath111 .",
    "note that in this spectral region fused quartz is very weakly absorbing . for fused quartz",
    "the velocity of longitudinal ultrasonic vibrations is @xmath112cm / s . in figures below",
    "we have plotted the spectral - angular density of the radiation intensity , @xmath113 , for the energy of electrons equal to @xmath114mev and for the plate thickness @xmath115 cm . for the oscillation amplitude we have taken the value @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the number of electrons per unit volume for fused quartz .    as it is seen from the graphs given below the presence of the acoustic wave leads to the appearance of new peaks in both angular and spectral distributions of the radiation intensity .",
    "the height of the peaks can be tuned by choosing the parameters of the acoustic wave . in particular , the peak in the radiation intensity which is present in the absence of the acoustic wave is reduced by the factor @xmath86 , where @xmath118 is the argument of the bessel function in ( [ iom1 ] ) .",
    "this peak can be completely removed by taking the parameters of the acoustic wave in such a way to have @xmath119 , @xmath120 , where @xmath121 are the zeroes of the function @xmath91 . in a similar way",
    "other peaks can be suppressed by tuning the acoustic wave parameters .",
    "the graphs in figure [ fig1 ] ( full curves ) are plotted for the frequency of acoustic wave @xmath122 mhz .",
    "the dashed curves correspond to the radiation intensity in the absence of the acoustic wave .",

    "in the present paper we have investigated the transition radiation from an electron in a plate in the presence of acoustic waves . in the quasi - classical approximation",
    "we have derived formulae for the electromagnetic field and the radiation intensity in the forward direction .",
    "the spectral - angular density of the radiated energy is given by formula ( iom1 ) .",
