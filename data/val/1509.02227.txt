    "langevin equations are stochastic differential equations that have seen widespread applications in many areas of physics @xcite .",
    "they form a sound effective description in situations where a strict separation of time scales prevails , i.e. , where one has both fast and slow degrees of freedom .",
    "langevin equations then provide equations of motion for the relevant slow modes , whereas the effects of the fast degrees ( e.g. , the environment ) are incorporated via stochastic forcing .    since the initial use of a langevin equation for the description of a brownian particle @xcite",
    ", many other problems have been tackled using stochastic differential equations .",
    "obvious problems can be found in biological settings where large particles are moving in an aqueous environment .",
    "but there are also important problems in condensed matter and material physics that can be successfully addressed using langevin equations .",
    "well - known examples include domain walls in magnetic systems , fluctuating interfaces , or flux lines in type - ii superconductors .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the use of langevin equations for the study of interacting vortices in a disordered environment .",
    "our main focus is on high-@xmath0 superconductors @xcite where glassy states are realized at low temperatures due to the competition of long - range vortex - vortex interaction and short - range defect pinning .",
    "more specifically , we will discuss in some detail the properties of these systems when they are forced far away from thermal equilibrium . by employing the methods of langevin molecular dynamics",
    ", we numerically solve the set of coupled stochastic differential equations describing our systems .",
    "in particular , our model systems are well suited for the application of this method due to the separation into many slow degrees of freedom embedded in an environment dominated by fast flluctuating thermal degrees of freedom .    in principle",
    ", a system can be prepared far from equilibrium in two different ways . in the first case",
    "the system is subjected to an external drive that yields a non - equilibrium steady state .",
    "non - equilibrium steady states have been a focus of many studies in statistical physics that aim at finding a comprehensive theoretical framework allowing to determine the stationary probability density and probability current distribution .",
    "whereas some progress has been made in certain instances , a comprehensive theory remains elusive .",
    "non - equilibrium steady states are also of interest in the context of vortex matter as they emerge naturally when applying a driving force to the system .",
    "another way to induce a system out of equilibrium is to force it away from a stationary state through a sudden change of at least one of the system parameters @xcite .",
    "this sudden change , often called quench , can be realized in different ways .",
    "very common is a temperature quench , but other types of quenches ( magnetic field or vortex density as well as external current or drive quenches ) are also possible and will be discussed in this paper .",
    "once the system has been brought out of the initial steady state , it will relax towards a new stationary state .",
    "this relaxation process can be very long - lasting in systems with slow or glassy - like dynamics .",
    "in some instances this relaxation process manifests itself through characteristic dynamical scaling behavior @xcite .",
    "in other cases relaxation is a very involved process , due to the competition between different physical interactions or other effects , and time - dependent quantities may exhibit a very rich and complex behavior .",
    "the intricate slow relaxation processes of interacting magnetic vortices in disordered type - ii superconductors deep inside the low - temperature bragg glass phase are of this second type .",
    "this paper is meant to provide a didactic introduction to the investigation of non - equilibrium properties of flux lines in a disordered environment using langevin molecular dynamics . after introducing the basics of langevin dynamics in the next section , we focus in section 3 on the study of interacting vortex matter using langevin molecular dynamics .",
    "we first recall the effective description through an elastic line model before describing the implementation of langevin molecular dynamics for this system .",
    "section 4 presents a range of results , both for driven vortices in the steady state as well as for non - equilibrium relaxation processes that result from a quench of one of the external system control parameters .",
    "we conclude in section 5 .",
    "before we employ langevin molecular dynamics for the investigation of the non - equilibrium properties of vortices in a disordered environment in the next section , it is useful to first illustrate the concept of a langevin equation through simpler examples .",
    "for that reason we will briefly recall the case of a brownian particle , followed be a general discussion of the langevin equation of a system characterized by a hamiltonian and the associated boltzmann - gibbs equilibrium probability distribution .",
    "the paradigmatic example of a langevin equation is of course the stochastic equation that describes a particle immersed in a fluid .",
    "this particle is continuously exposed to collisions with the molecules of the fluid .",
    "assuming that there is no net flow , the molecules hit the particle with the same rate from all sides , i.e. , on average the force on the particle due to the fluid molecules is zero . in a probabilistic description",
    "this can be modeled by a stochastic force with zero mean . as the particle moves through the fluid , a hydrodynamic drag force sets in as a consequence of the random collisions with the fluid molecules that impedes the motion of the particle .",
    "taking these two effects into account , the equation of motion governing the particle is given by the langevin equation @xmath1 here @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the instantaneous velocity and the mass of the particle , respectively , @xmath4 is the friction coefficient , and * f*(t ) represents the stochastic force .    before discussing the noise term further ,",
    "let us stress that a stochastic description like equation ( [ eq : brownian ] ) assumes a separation of time scales between slow degrees of freedom ( in this case the particle ) and fast degrees of freedom ( the fluid molecules ) .",
    "usually the fast degrees of freedom represent the environment in which the slow degrees evolve .    for the stochastic noise the following two assumptions",
    "are usually made : ( 1 ) the collisions of the fluid molecules with the particle are uncorrelated in time , and ( 2 ) the random forces are drawn from a gaussian probability distribution with zero mean : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote cartesian coordinate indices and @xmath8 is the strength of the noise . while these assumptions are perfectly sound for a brownian particle , one should make sure for each situation whether they are indeed meaningful for the problem at hand .",
    "the noise term @xmath8 , which measures the strength of the fluctuations , and the friction coefficient @xmath4 , which describes dissipation , are related through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( called einstein relation in the present context ) : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the temperature of the environment and @xmath11 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "if the inertia time is larger than @xmath12 , inertial effects can be disregarded , and the particle s motion is then governed by the overdamped langevin equation @xmath13 where we have added a conservative force @xmath14 originating from a potential @xmath15 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : brownian_dynamics ] ) is in fact the starting point for brownian dynamics as well as for langevin molecular dynamics used in the following .",
    "note that imposing the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ensures that this stochastic differential equation correctly describes the equilibrium properties of our particle .",
    "the overdamped langevin equation ( [ eq : brownian_dynamics ] ) is readily generalized to situations with @xmath16 degrees of freedom ( spatial coordinates of the particles ) governed by a hamiltonian @xmath17 $ ] that is a functional of the position vectors @xmath18 of the different slow degrees of freedom . in that case one",
    "has the following set of coupled stochastic differential equations @xmath19}{\\delta { \\bf r}_i(t ) }   + { \\bf f}_i(t)~,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 labels the different particles .",
    "as before , the effects of the fast degrees of freedom coming from the environment are captured by the stochastic force @xmath21 acting on particle @xmath22 .",
    "these stochastic forces have again zero mean , @xmath23 , and are taken from a gaussian distribution , thereby fulfilling the einstein relation ( in @xmath24 spatial dimensions ) @xmath25 this set of equations guarantees that in equilibrium the system samples configurations with the correct canonical equilibrium probability distribution , @xmath26 .",
    "however , out of equilibrium , which is our primary interest in the following , it is important to note that different microscopic dynamics might yield different results .",
    "this is even true in cases where the same probability distribution is ultimately obtained in equilibrium .",
    "a detailed comparison between different implementations of the system s dynamics might therefore be in order if one wishes to ascertain that out - of - equilibrium results are not merely artefacts of the dynamics ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "we consider in the following @xmath16 interacting elastic lines in a disordered environment . having in mind magnetic flux lines in high-@xmath0 superconductors , we remark that this situation corresponds to the extreme london limit with the superconducting coherence length much smaller than the london penetration depth @xcite .",
    "vortex lines are then described by their trajectories @xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes the direction of the applied external magnetic field , and the two - dimensional vector @xmath29 indicates the @xmath30 position of line @xmath22 at height @xmath28 . as an immediate consequence of this description , magnetic flux lines in this model can not form loops or overhangs , since @xmath27 has to be unique .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption , as long as the vortex energy per length ( i.e , .",
    "the elastic line tension ) remains large compared to the energy scale of thermal fluctuations .",
    "the effective hamiltonian of this system is written as a functional of the vortex line trajectories with an extent of @xmath31 in the @xmath28 direction and consists of three competing terms : the elastic line energy , the external potential due to disordered pinning sites , and the repulsive vortex - vortex interaction : @xmath32 & = & \\frac{\\tilde{\\epsilon}_1}{2 } \\sum_{i=1}^n \\int_0^l \\bigg\\arrowvert     \\frac{d{\\bf r}_i(z)}{dz } \\bigg\\arrowvert^2 \\ , dz      + \\sum_{i=1}^n \\int_0^l v_d\\bigl ( { \\bf r}_i(z ) \\bigr ) \\ , dz \\nonumber \\\\     & & + \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{i \\ne j } \\int_0^l v\\bigl(|{\\bf r}_i(z)-{\\bf r}_j(z)|      \\bigr ) \\ , dz \\ .",
    "\\label{hamilt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consistent with the extreme london limit , the repulsive vortex - vortex pair interaction is set purely in - plane between different flux line elements .",
    "below we will provide expressions for the attractive pinning potential and repulsive interaction appropriate for high-@xmath0 superconductors .    in order to employ a langevin molecular dynamics algorithm to simulate the vortex line dynamics , we discretize the system into layers along the @xmath28 axis .",
    "forces acting on the flux line vertices can then be derived from the properly discretized version of the hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) .",
    "we subsequently proceed to numerically solve the set of coupled overdamped langevin equations @xmath33}{\\delta",
    "{ \\bf r}_i(t , z ) }   + { \\bf f}_i(t , z ) + { \\bf f}_d~. \\label{langevin_sc}\\ ] ] as discussed in the previous section , the fast , microscopic degrees of freedom of the surrounding medium are captured by thermal stochastic forces @xmath34 , modeled as uncorrelated gaussian white noise with vanishing mean and fulfilling the einstein relations ( [ eq : fdt ] ) in @xmath35 dimensions .",
    "this guarantees that the system relaxes to thermal equilibrium with a canonical probability distribution in absence of an external driving force @xmath36 . in type - ii superconductors such an external driving force stems from applied external currents via the lorentz force .",
    "the time integration is performed via simple discretization of equation ( [ langevin_sc ] ) @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we also considered the situation of small inertia times .",
    "the langevin equation then acquires an additional inertial term and the time stepping algorithm becomes slightly more complicated @xcite .",
    "high-@xmath0 superconducting materials are layered compounds and highly anisotropic : the lattice constant in the crystallographic @xmath37 direction is much larger than the in - plane ones along the @xmath38 and @xmath39 directions ; correspondingly , the effective charge carrier masses @xmath40 and @xmath41 differ as well for the different directions .",
    "henceforth we always assume that the magnetic field is aligned with the material s crystallographic @xmath37 direction , and the material properties discussed below are given for this configuration and assigned the in - plane index @xmath42 . when discretizing the system into layers along the @xmath28 axis we choose the crystallographic @xmath37 axis unit cell size @xmath43 as layer spacing @xcite .",
    "this anisotropy also shows up in the expressions for the model parameters when using the effective elastic line model ( [ hamilt ] ) .",
    "the elastic line stiffness or local tilt modulus is given by @xmath44 . here",
    "@xmath45 is the london penetration depth and @xmath46 is the coherence length , both in the @xmath42 plane , whereas @xmath47 denotes the effective mass ratio .",
    "the energy per length @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 , with the magnetic flux quantum @xmath50 .",
    "finally the bardeen - stephen viscous drag coefficient @xmath4 in the langevin equation ( [ langevin_sc ] ) is @xmath51 , where @xmath52 represents the normal - state resistivity @xcite .    for our implementation of the langevin molecular dynamics method for disordered type - ii superconductors @xcite we also require expressions for the vortex - vortex interaction as well as for the attractive pinning potential .",
    "the repulsive in - plane vortex - vortex interaction is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the zeroth - order modified bessel function .",
    "this is essentially a logarithmic repulsion that is exponentially screened at the scale @xmath45 . in order to avoid artefacts due to periodic boundary conditions in directions perpendicular to @xmath28",
    ", we cut off the interaction at @xmath55 .",
    "pinning sites are modeled by randomly distributed smooth potential wells of the form @xmath56~,\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the pinning potential strength , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 denote the @xmath28 position and in - plane location of pinning site @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "the pinning potential width @xmath61 will be our unit of length , whereas energies will be measured in units of @xmath62 .",
    "the full pinning potential @xmath63 is then obtained by summing over all @xmath64 localized pinning sites in the system : @xmath65 for the case of random point defects , which is the only case considered in this paper , these pinning centers are randomly distributed and chosen independently for each layer . if one were to instead consider columnar defects aligned parallel to the magnetic field along the @xmath28 direction , then one would repeat the same spatial distribution pattern for each layer @xcite .",
    "the numbers we use for our model parameters are consistent with the actual values for ybco @xcite .",
    "we set the pinning potential width @xmath66 and also choose @xmath67 .",

    "the effective mass anisotropy ratio is @xmath70 and the normal - state resistivity near @xmath0 becomes @xmath71 . with this , the numerical values of all model parameters can be calculated .",
    "it then also follows that our fundamental temporal unit is @xmath72 ps . in the following",
    "we shall measure all time intervals in units of @xmath73 .",
    "a large range of quantities of interest are at one s disposal when studying the out - of - equilibrium properties of vortex matter .",
    "some of these quantities are especially useful to characterize the steady - state properties in the presence of an external driving force , others allow us to capture the complex relaxation processes in situations where the system is initialized far from a steady state .    a typical experimentally accessible quantity is the current - voltage ( i - v ) characteristics . from a langevin",
    "molecular dynamics study an equivalent description is obtained from a graph relating the driving force @xmath36 to the mean vortex velocity @xmath74 .",
    "indeed , from faraday s law the mean vortex velocity , which results from the velocities of each line element in direction of the driving force , is related to an induced electric field @xmath75 and therefore to a voltage drop across the sample .",
    "a relation between the driving force @xmath36 and an applied external current density @xmath76 follows from the lorentz force : @xmath77 .",
    "the thermal spatial fluctuations along the vortex lines can be captured by the radius of gyration .",
    "defined as @xmath78 , this quantity is in fact nothing else than the average root mean - square displacement from the mean lateral positions of the lines . here",
    ", @xmath79 indicates an average over all line elements of line @xmath22 as well as an average over all @xmath16 lines and different realizations of the disorder and the noise .",
    "a third way to explore steady - state properties of driven vortex matter is to study the pinning time statistics .",
    "this is done by calculating the distribution of flux line element dwelling times at defect sites .",
    "the dwelling time at pins is obtained by monitoring the positions of flux line elements and recording the instances where they enter and leave the attractive pinning centers .",
    "non - equilibrium relaxation processes are best studied by preparing a system in a specific state before suddenly changing a system parameter @xcite .",
    "this sudden change , often referred to as a quench , can be realized in many ways , depending on the physical system under investigation . for disordered vortex",
    "matter the following three types of quenches can be realized experimentally : temperature quenches , magnetic field ( or vortex density ) quenches , and external current ( i.e. , driving force ) quenches .",
    "after such a quench the system ends up in a state far from stationarity .",
    "the resulting relaxation processes can then be monitored through various quantities .",
    "many previous studies of glasses ( structural glasses or spin glasses ) as well as of systems with glassy - like dynamics have revealed that relaxation and related aging processes are best investigated through two - time quantities @xcite .",
    "indeed , as a system after the quench is far from stationarity , time translation invariance is broken and the properties of the system change with the time elapsed since the quench . as a result",
    "an observable that depends on two times @xmath80 and @xmath81 is not only a function of the time difference @xmath82 but depends in more complicated ways on these two times .    in the context of interacting vortices in a disordered environment an impressive list of two - time quantities",
    "has been discussed @xcite .",
    "some of these quantities contain information about local thermal fluctuations , whereas others provide insight into the time evolution of the global structure of the flux line configuration .",
    "we refrain from discussing all these quantities , but instead only introduce those used and displayed in the following concise overview : the height - height autocorrelation function ( sometimes simply called the roughness ) probes the local thermal fluctuations of vortices about their mean lateral position .",
    "it is defined as @xmath83 where the averages are again taken over the flux line elements of all lines as well as noise and disorder realizations .",
    "the average square distance between a vortex line element s position at the two times @xmath80 and @xmath84 is measured by the two - time mean square displacement @xmath85 this quantity contains information on the decay and formation of global structures .",
    "we illustrate the rich physics of interacting magnetic vortices in disordered type - ii superconductors that is governed by competing energy and hence length and time scales , through various characteristic examples that address both fluctuations in non - equilibrium steady states @xcite as well as complex out - of - equilibrium relaxation scenarios initiated from very different starting configurations @xcite . in this brief overview ,",
    "we focus on systems with comparatively weak magnetic fields and hence low vortex density , and at low temperatures .",
    "consequently the equilibrium stationary configurations in the presence of attractive point - like pinning centers likely reside in the disorder - dominated bragg glass thermodynamic phase , wherein spatial positional order is disrupted at long length scales . at the cost of elastic energy , the flux lines attempt to accommodate as many localized defect sites as possible , which renders their trajectories through the sample quite rough @xcite .",
    "when sufficiently large external currents are applied , the vortices detach from the pinning centers and freely flow through the sample .",
    "they then tend to reorder into regular triangular moving lattices . at zero temperature , the transition from the pinned , glassy phase with drift velocity @xmath86 to the moving state with @xmath87 is sharp , and represents a continuous non - equilibrium phase transition @xcite . at finite temperatures ,",

    "the flux lines hardly move , but display thermal fluctuations ; the system remains superconducting . for larger drives , the mean vortex speed scales linearly with the driving force .",
