    "the efficiency of transport systems has been of interest in various fields , including physics , biology and engineering . in transport processes ,",
    "the item being transported usually follows the steepest descent of the underlying surface , e.g. , water flowing down the slopes of a mountain .",
    "flow in networks has been modeled by toroczkai et al .",
    "@xcite by the introduction of local gradients on a substrate network",
    ". the gradient network defined on this network has provided significant insights into the dominant structures that provide transport efficiency .",
    "they have considered a fixed network of @xmath0 nodes with a scalar potential , @xmath1 at each node @xmath2 .",
    "the gradient @xmath3 of the potential at each node @xmath2 is a directed edge which points from @xmath2 to the neighbor with the minimum potential among all the neighbors of @xmath2 .",
    "toroczkai et al have shown several properties of gradient networks which we briefly summarize .",
    "an interesting topological property of the gradient network is that its in - degree distribution is scale - free for both scale - free ( sf ) and erds - rnyi ( er ) substrate networks  @xcite .",
    "a gradient network with a non - degenerate potential distribution , is a group of trees , hence no loops exist in this network other than self - loops .",
    "only this property makes the gradient networks very common in seemingly unrelated problems , i.e. , synchronization in oscillatory networks @xcite .",
    "the relationship between network topology and congestion has also been investigated @xcite by introducing a measure of congestion , the jamming coefficient .",
    "this measure involves the ratio of the number of nodes that receive at least one gradient link , @xmath4 and the number of nodes that send a link . by definition",
    ", every node sends one out link , therefore the number of senders in the network , @xmath5 .",
    "the jamming coefficient is    @xmath6    the operations @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the statistical averaging over local potentials and networks respectively .",
    "maximal congestion occurs at @xmath9 , and no congestion occurs when every link receives a gradient link , corresponding to @xmath10 .",
    "it was also found that @xmath11 is independent of number of nodes @xmath0 for scale free substrate network , and these networks are not prone to maximal jamming .",
    "the jamming coefficient was extensively studied by park et al .",
    "@xcite where they compared it for er and sf networks with the same average degree , @xmath12 , for @xmath13 . with randomly assigned potentials on each node , below @xmath14",
    ", they found that er networks are less congested than sf networks .    here",
    "we introduce a monte carlo optimization scheme that reduces jamming significantly and introduces structural correlations into the system that are not built in .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : opt ] we introduce the algorithm for optimizing jamming coefficient that is initially calculated from randomly assigned scalar values at each node .",
    "we compare the optimized jamming values of a scale - free network and an erds - rnyi network for various values of average degrees . in section  [ sec : structure ]",
    "we investigate the structure of the optimal gradient network .",
    "in particular we study the degree distribution and the correlations between the degree and the potential of each node . finally in section  [ sec : conc ] we discuss the implications and the possible extensions of optimal gradient networks .",
    "previous work  @xcite has focused on random gradient networks where the potential on each node has a randomly assigned value .",
    "more generally , the potentials can be a dynamic quantity evolving in time due to perturbations , sources and sinks internal and external to the system of interest .",
    "alternatively , the potentials can evolve to become correlated to the network properties such as its degree distribution .",
    "for example , consider the networks of routers where every router has a capacity .",
    "if a router is central and highly connected , it usually has a higher capacity in order to handle the traffic en - route effectively .",
    "recently , a congestion aware routing algorithm has been introduced where the transport on the network of routers is driven by congestion - gradients @xcite .    here",
    "we develop a monte carlo algorithm to achieve two goals : reduce jamming in the network , and observe the emerging optimal correlation between in - degree and potential of each node . for a given network and potential distribution , we redefine j in eq .",
    "[ eq : jam ] as @xmath15 where @xmath16 by definition .",
    "the initial potential distribution is chosen from a gaussian distribution , and at each iteration the potential of a random node is modified such that global congestion is reduced .",
    "we use a metropolis algorithm @xcite with the following steps :    1 .   pick a node , @xmath2 at random .",
    "2 .   vary @xmath1 by @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath18 where @xmath17 is a gaussian random variable with variance @xmath19 .",

    "4 .   accept @xmath20 with probability @xmath21 $ ] where @xmath22 .",
    "go to step 1 , and repeat .",
    "the fictitious temperature , @xmath23 is chosen to adjust the acceptance ratio to about 40% .",
    "we perform the optimization procedure until @xmath24 equilibrates , i.e. , at large @xmath25 the time autocorrelation function of @xmath24 @xcite , @xmath26 } { [ \\langle j^2 \\rangle - \\langle j \\rangle^2]},\\ ] ] goes to zero .    using the described optimization algorithm",
    ", we can significantly reduce the jamming coefficient in both sf and er networks . following previous work @xcite we choose as the sf network a barabsi - albert model  @xcite . for this network",
    "the average connectivity is @xmath27 where each node has at minimum @xmath28 links .",
    "the network size throughout the paper is chosen to be @xmath29 .",
    "for the er networks , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the probability of having a link between any pair of nodes .",
    "we use the same @xmath12 when comparing the two types of network by adjusting @xmath28 and @xmath31 .",
    "the evolution of jamming coefficient during optimization is shown in fig .",

    "as shown in fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] congestion can be reduced in gradient networks by varying the potentials at each node .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the obtained optimal potentials may also alter the structure of the gradient network .",
    "next , we analyze the structural properties of optimal gradient networks such as the degree distribution . previously , the random gradient network of an er substrate network was shown numerically and analytically @xcite to have an in - degree distribution of @xmath51 .",
    "however , the sf substrate network with degree distribution @xmath52 , was shown to have a gradient degree distribution of @xmath53 .",
    "the degree distribution of the random and optimal er and sf networks are shown for @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) and @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) respectively in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] along with the expected scaling exponents for the random gradient networks of @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the statistical averaging is obtained over 100 networks . for er networks",
    ", the scaling region extends with higher average connectivity , however we chose to use a small @xmath55 for which optimization is more efficient .",
    "the optimization is performed for 1 million monte carlo steps .",
    "the jamming values initially are 0.62 , 0.71 and after optimization reduce to 0.36 , 0.60 for sf and er respectively .",
    "the in - degree distribution , @xmath60 , for the sf network varies significantly with the optimization .",
    "the cut - off degree is reduced an order of magnitude ( from roughly 100 to 10 ) compared to the random one , and the scaling is now steeper . on the other hand , the er network does not show a major change in the degree distribution .    , for gradient networks of ( a ) sf and ( b ) er networks with @xmath56 and @xmath54 respectively before ( @xmath39 ) and after ( @xmath38 ) optimization of jamming .",

    "@xcite , where @xmath62 and @xmath58 for random sf and er networks respectively .",

    "[ fig : fig3],width=321 ]    next , we analyze the probability distribution of potentials for nodes in the substrate networks with degree @xmath64 , before and after the optimization to observe any degree - potential correlations . the results are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig4 ] for the sf network ( @xmath56 ) . to reduce noise in the data especially for large values of @xmath64 ,",
    "the degrees are binned into four groups : @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 . before optimization with initial random gaussian potentials within range [ -4 , 4 ]",
    ", each set has the same probability distribution @xmath69 as shown in the inset of fig  [ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "this behavior is expected as no correlation was built in between the degree of a node and its potential . after the optimization",
    "however , the range of the potentials has broadened significantly , and the nodes with high degree have accumulated very large potentials .     for sf network with @xmath70 before ( inset ) and after optimization .",
    "the degrees are binned to indicate the correlation between degree of a node and its potential : @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) , @xmath66 ( @xmath73 ) , @xmath74 ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath68 ( @xmath39 ) . before the optimization @xmath69",
    "do not show any correlations with @xmath64 , however after the optimization , nodes with high degree , get the large values of potential which facilitates reduced jamming .",
    "[ fig : fig4],width=321 ]    with the improved jamming coefficient , it is natural to expect some correlation to emerge between the potential of the node and its degree",
    ". if the node has a large degree and a small potential , this node will be preferred by most of its neighbors for sending an out link , and thus this will contribute to higher jamming .",
    "however if the potential is large , the neighboring nodes will not prefer this highly connected node and thus not increase the jamming .",
    "this intuitive observation implies the possibility of obtaining a reduced congestion by starting with potentials that are inversely correlated with the degree of each node on the substrate network .",
    "we tested this case for the sf network ( @xmath56 ) with a correlated potential distribution , @xmath75 at node @xmath2 with degree @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a random number chosen from a uniform distribution .",
    "this assignment with correlations built - in did not make the jamming coefficient lower . on the contrary it was higher , @xmath78 , than the value without degree correlation , @xmath79 .",
    "an interesting observation that fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] provides is that nodes with small degree carry potentials distributed over a large range @xmath80 $ ] .",
    "for example , nodes with degrees , @xmath81 have a roughly gaussian potential distribution .",
    "for higher @xmath64 , the distribution narrows down and shifts toward larger values . for nodes with @xmath82 ,",
    "all nodes have large potentials , within range @xmath83 $ ] .",
    "this observation might explain why in the test case the jamming was actually higher when the degree was correlated with the potential .",
    "in that case , we only assigned low potentials to low degree nodes which still yields congestion much higher than the optimal one . an analytical formulation that distributes the potentials according to its degree mimicking the transitive behavior in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] seems possible , but is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have introduced a monte carlo method to optimize congestion in random gradient networks . previously the potentials have been assigned randomly and was shown that er networks had lower jamming coefficient below @xmath55 than sf networks with the same connectivity @xcite .",
    "this was puzzling as the connectivity commonly observed in natural and man - made networks  @xcite is usually in this range , but tends to be scale - free , and in scale - free networks jamming is independent of @xmath0 . with the monte carlo based optimization scheme we optimized jamming by varying the potentials so that optimal congestion was achieved .",
    "we found that optimal sf networks have lower congestion factor for @xmath46 .",
    "this reduced congestion is the result of a complex correlation between the degree and the potential of a node .",
    "we found that nodes with large degrees in the substrate network get large positive values whereas nodes with small degrees get a gaussian like distribution of potentials .    throughout the paper",
    "we have used the definition of jamming introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for a substrate network with unweighted links .",
    "a natural extension of this work for generality is to assign weights to links and redefine the jamming coefficient accordingly .",
    "a possible definition is @xmath84 \\big ) / \\sum_i c_i$ ] where @xmath85 , @xmath86 is the number of neighboring links node @xmath2 has , @xmath87 is the capacity of node @xmath2 , @xmath88 is the weight of the incoming link from j to i , and the operation @xmath89 = 0 $ ] if @xmath90 .",
    "if the weights and capacity of all nodes are 1 , then this definition of @xmath11 reduces to the one in eq .",
