    "describing the microscopic origin of structural slowing down on cooling or compressing glass - forming liquids is one of the most challenging problems in condensed matter physics . during the past decade",
    "the research in this field was strongly influenced by the idealized mode - coupling theory ( mct ) for the evolution of structural relaxation  @xcite .",
    "the theory predicts the structural arrest  also referred to as the idealized liquid - glass transition  driven by the mutual blocking of a particle and its neighbors ( `` cage effect '' ) at a critical temperature @xmath0 which is located above the glass - transition temperature @xmath1 . for temperatures close to but above @xmath0",
    ", mct predicts universal scaling laws and power laws for describing the glassy slow structural relaxation .",
    "although such complete structural arrest at @xmath0 is not observed in experiments and therefore the idealized theory can not literally be applied for describing dynamics below @xmath0 , extensive tests of the theoretical predictions carried out so far against experimental and computer - simulation results suggest that mct deals properly with some essential features of supercooled liquids  @xcite",
    ".    the molecular van der waals liquid orthoterphenyl ( otp ) has long been used as a model system in the study of the glass transition .",
    "( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and papers quoted therein . ) extensive experiments on otp have been performed to monitor the onset of glassy structural relaxation on microscopic time and length scales .",
    "using in particular quasielastic neutron scattering , the decay of collective and self density fluctuations has been measured as a function of temperature , pressure , and wavenumber  @xcite .",
    "based on these studies , the validity of the _ universal _ predictions of mct , such as the factorization theorem and the time - temperature superposition principle , has been established .",
    "however , there are _ nonuniversal _ aspects in the glassy structural relaxation which can not be elucidated solely by those universal predictions . for example , parameters describing the decay of the collective density fluctuations in the @xmath2-relaxation regime exhibit a characteristic wavenumber dependence , which is an important nonuniversal aspect to be accounted for by the theory  @xcite . as will be discussed below , we found from the analysis of molecular - dynamics ( md ) simulation results interesting dynamical properties of otp at intermediate wavenumbers , and their theoretical investigation is one of the main points of the present paper .",
    "one of the distinctive features of mct is that it can also make predictions concerning nonuniversal aspects , such as the value of @xmath0 and the details of the time and wavenumber dependence of various dynamical quantities , provided the system s static structure factor is known with sufficient accuracy . utilizing this feature ,",
    "there have been quantitative tests of the theory concerning nonuniversal as well as universal aspects using as input only the static structure factor determined from integral - equation theories or from computer simulations  @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we apply mct to discuss in detail properties of the slow structural relaxation in otp , paying special attention to the wavenumber dependence of the structural @xmath2 relaxation of the collective dynamics .",
    "this will done by regarding md simulation results as a bridge connecting experimental data and theoretical predictions .",
    "although otp is one of the simplest molecular systems from an experimental side , it is rather a complicated system for a theoretical treatment .",
    "therefore , it is unavoidable to deal with a simple model for otp which is still efficient in mimicking the complexity of the dynamical behavior of real system . in this respect , lewis and wahnstrm ( lw )",
    "@xcite introduced a particularly useful three - site model , each site playing the role of a whole phenyl ring , and this model will be considered in this paper .    for the lw otp model , static and dynamic properties in supercooled states",
    "have been extensively studied based on md simulations  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "the simulation results for the static structure factors serve as input to the theory , and those for dynamics can be used in testing the so - obtained theoretical results .",
    "thereby , a stringent test of mct predictions against the simulation results can be performed .",
    "furthermore , by making connections between the simulation results for lw otp and experimental ones for real system , the relevance of our theoretical results and their interpretation in understanding experimental data can be established .",
    "a theoretical analysis for lw otp has already been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite based on a simplified theory which is essentially the same as the one for spherical particles .",
    "but , since otp is a molecular system , a full molecular approach is desirable .",
    "recently , mct for spherical particles has been extended to a theory for molecules .",
    "this has been done based on the tensor- and site - density formulations . in the tensor - density formulation ,",
    "the density - fluctuation correlator is generalized to the one of infinite matrices of correlation functions formed with tensor - density fluctuations  @xcite . however , the tensor - density formulation has the difficulty that the resulting equations are so involved , and it is not obvious whether those equations can be numerically solved within the regime of glassy dynamics . to overcome this difficulty , it has been suggested to base mct for molecular systems on the site representation  @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations of the interaction - site densities have been used as the basic variables to describe the structure of the system . as a result ,",
    "the known scalar mct equations for the density fluctuations in simple systems have been generalized to @xmath3-by-@xmath3 matrix equations for the interaction - site - density fluctuations , where @xmath3 denotes the number of atoms ( or sites ) forming the molecule .",
    "thus , relatively simple equations of motions can be obtained within the site - representation , and these mct equations will be solved in the present work to discuss the structural relaxation in otp .",
