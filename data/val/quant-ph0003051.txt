    "quantum decoherence and measurement have attracted new interest owing to advances in nanotechnology . here",
    "we present our recent work culminating in a solvable model of a measurement process.@xcite it has been argued that interaction with external environment , modeled by a large , macroscopic `` bath , '' is an essential ingredient of the measurement process .",
    "coupling to the bath is responsible for decoherence which creates a statistical mixture of eigenstates from the initially fully or partially coherent quantum state of the measured system .",
    "another important macroscopic part of a measurement setup is the `` pointer '' that stores the outcome .",
    "it has been conjectured that the bath also plays a crucial role in the selection of those quantum states of the pointer that manifest themselves in classical observations.@xcite in this work we present a model in which a multimode pointer retains information on the measurement outcome because of its coupling to the measured system , without the need to couple it also directly to the bath .",
    "however , the measured system is assumed to be coupled to the bath .",
    "the latter then also affects the dynamics of the pointer because both of them are coupled to the measured system .",
    "exact results for models of quantum systems interacting with their environment are quite limited . in the framework of an exactly solvable model of a quantum oscillator coupled to a heat bath of oscillators",
    ", it has been shown@xcite that the reduced density matrix of the system looses its off - diagonal elements in the eigenbasis of the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "such loss of correlations between the states of a quantum system is a manifestation of decoherence .",
    "recent work on decoherence@xcite has explored its effects for rather general cases , for bosonic ( oscillator ) and spin baths . applications for various physical systems have been reported.@xcite fermionic heat bath has also been considered.@xcite    we note that a true heat bath should cause a microscopic system interacting with it to thermalize .",
    "in fact , we are not aware of any adequate general , truly microscopic model of such a process . instead",
    ", the `` temperature '' is usually introduced phenomenologically via the initial state of the noninteracting bath modes .",
    "the function of a measuring device is different from and more complex than that of a heat bath . in particular , it must store and amplify the measurement outcome information .",
    "one of the key issues in the description of a measurement process is the interpretation of the transfer of information stored after the system - pointer and system - bath interaction to the macroscopic level.@xcite here we offer a model of the process which corresponds to the first stage of measurement , in which the pointer acquires amplified information by entanglement with the state of the system .",
    "thus we do not claim to resolve the foundation - of - quantum - mechanics issue of how that information is passed on to the classical world , involving the collapse of the wave functions of the system and of each pointer mode .",
    "indeed , it is impossible to fully describe the wave function collapse within the unitary quantum - mechanical description of the three systems involved : the measured system , the pointer , and the bath , the latter being internal in the sense that , in our model , it only interacts with the measured system .",
    "one would have to consider an external bath ( the rest of the universe ) with which all the `` internal '' systems interact .",
    "as far as we know , this problem is not presently solved,@xcite and we first sidestep it by assuming separation of time scales ( see below ) .",
    "nevertheless , we later argue that the results of our model provide a useful insight into this aspect of the quantum measurement process .",
    "let us identify the three quantum systems involved .",
    "the first one , that is being measured , @xmath1 , is a microscopic system with the hamiltonian which will be also denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "second , the measuring device must have the `` bath '' or `` body '' part , @xmath2 , containing many modes .",
    "the @xmath3th mode will have the hamiltonian @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that the bath modes are not coupled to each other .",
    "the bath part of the measuring device is not observed , i.e. , it can be traced over .",
    "the last system is the pointer , @xmath5 , consisting of many modes ( that are not traced over ) .",
    "the pointer amplifies the information obtained in the measurement process and can later pass it on for further amplification or directly to macroscopic ( classical ) systems .",
    "the @xmath6th pointer mode has the hamiltonians @xmath7 .",
    "it is assumed that expectation values of some quantities in the pointer undergo a large change during the measurement .",
    "it will become evident later that the device modes involved in the measurement process can be rather simple so that one can focus on the evolution of the system @xmath1 and its effect on the pointer @xmath5 .",
    "however , it is the pointer interaction with the external bath ( some external modes , `` the rest of the universe '' ) that is presumed to select those quantum states of @xmath5 that manifest themselves classically . for now , we prefer to avoid the discussion of this matter,@xcite by assuming that the added evolution of the pointer due to such external interactions occurs on time scales larger than the measurement time , @xmath8 .",
    "similarly , when we state that the internal bath modes can be `` traced over , ''",
    "we really mean that their interactions with the rest of the universe are such that these modes play no role in the later , wave - function - collapse stage of the measurement process .",
    "moreover , the measuring device probes the state of the system @xmath1 at the initial time , @xmath9 , rather than its time evolution under @xmath1 alone .",
    "ideally the process of measurement is instantaneous . in practice",
    ", it has to be faster than the time scales associated with the dynamics under @xmath1 and the evolution due to the interactions of all the three systems involved , @xmath10 , with the rest of the universe .",
    "this can be obtained as the limit of a system in which very strong interactions between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and also between @xmath1 and @xmath5 , are switched on at @xmath9 and switched off at @xmath11 , with small time interval @xmath8 .",
    "of course , at later times the pointer can interact with other , external systems to pass on the result of the measurement .",
    "thus , in our approach , we will assume that the hamiltonian of the system itself , @xmath1 , as well as all the external interactions , can be neglected for the duration of the measurement , @xmath8 .    in the next section",
    "we introduce our model along the lines outlined above . in section  3",
    ", we carry out exact coherent - state calculations that explicitly show how the system and the pointer evolve into a statistical mixture of direct product states , representing the required framework for quantum measurement . in section  4",
    ", we describe the emergence of decoherence in the continuum limit of an infinite number of modes .",
    "we also present a general discussion of adiabatic quantum decoherence.@xcite finally , in the last section we calculate expectation values of some pointer operators that retain information on the outcome of the measurement process , and discuss implications of our results .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system and the measuring device will be written based on the assumptions presented in the preceding section .",
    "specifically , the internal hamiltonian of the measured system is ignored ( set to a constant which can be zero without loss of generality ) .",
    "this is because the dynamics of measurement is assumed to occur on the time scale @xmath8 much shorter than any internal dynamical evolution of the measured system , in order to probe only the instantaneous system wavefunction in the measurement process .",
    "we take    @xmath12    here @xmath0 is some hermitian operator of the system that couples to certain operators of the modes , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the subscript @xmath3 labels the noninteracting ( with each other ) modes of the bath , with their hamiltonians @xmath4 , whereas @xmath6 labels similar modes of the pointer , with hamiltonians @xmath7 .",
    "the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 are introduced to measure the coupling strength for the bath and pointer modes to the measured system , respectively .",
    "they are assumed very large ; the ideal measurement process could correspond to @xmath17 .",
    "we note that the modes of @xmath5 and @xmath2 can be similar .",
    "the only difference between the bath and pointer modes is in how they interact with the `` rest of the universe '' in a later stage of the measurement process : the bath is not observed ( traced over ) , whereas the pointer modes have their wave functions collapsed . through their entanglement with the measured system in the first stage of the measurement process , treated here",
    ", the pointer modes also cause the collapse of the system wavefunction .",
    "thus , we actually took the same coupling operator @xmath0 for the bath and pointer .",
    "in fact , all the exact calculations reported in this work can be also carried out for different coupling operators @xmath18 and @xmath19 , for the bath and pointer modes , provided they commute , @xmath20=0 $ ] , so that they share a common set of eigenfunctions .",
    "the final wavefunction of the measured system , after the full measurement , is in this set .",
    "analytical calculation can be even extended to the case when the system hamiltonian @xmath1 is retained in ( 1 ) , provided all three operators , @xmath21 , commute pairwise .",
    "the essential physical ingredients of the model are captured by the simpler choice ( 1 ) .",
    "we will later specify all the operators in ( 1 ) as the modes of the bosonic heat bath of caldeira - leggett type.@xcite for now , however , let us keep our discussion general .",
    "we will assume that the system operator @xmath0 has a nondegenerate , discrete spectrum of eigenstates :    @xmath22    some additional assumptions on the spectrum of @xmath0 and @xmath1 will be encountered later .",
    "we also note that the requirement that the coupling parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 are large may in practice be satisfied by that , at the time of the measurement , the system hamiltonian @xmath1 corresponds to slow or trivial dynamics .    initially , at @xmath9 , the quantum systems @xmath10 and their modes",
    "are not correlated with each other .",
    "we assume that @xmath23 is the initial density matrix of the measured system .",
    "the initial state of each bath and pointer mode will be assumed thermalized , with @xmath24 and the density matrices    @xmath25    respectively .",
    "we can not offer any fundamental physical reason for having the initial bath and pointer mode states thermalized , especially for the pointer .",
    "this choice is really made to allow exact solvability , though we could claim that the bath and pointer might be thermalized if they are in contact with the `` rest of the universe '' for a long time before the measurement .",
    "the density matrix of the full system at time @xmath8 is then    @xmath26 e^{iht/\\hbar } \\ ; . \\eqno(4)\\ ] ]    the bath is not probed and it can be traced over .",
    "the resulting reduced density matrix @xmath27 of the combined system @xmath28 will be represented as by its matrix elements in the eigenbasis of @xmath0 .",
    "these quantities are each an operator in the space of @xmath5 :    @xmath29    we now assume that operators in different spaces and of different modes commute . note that until now our discussion was quite general .",
    "the commutability requirement is trivial for the bosonic and spin bath modes .",
    "however , it must be checked carefully if baths with fermionic modes are used .",
    "then one can show that    @xmath30   \\left [ \\prod_k { \\rm tr}_k \\left\\ { e^{-i t \\,\\left ( b_k + b \\lambda { \\cal b}_k \\right)/\\hbar } \\theta_k   e^{i t \\,\\left ( b_k + b \\lambda^\\prime { \\cal b}_k \\right)/\\hbar } \\right\\ } \\right ] \\ ; , \\eqno(6)\\ ] ]    where @xmath31 .",
    "this result involves products of @xmath5-space operators and traces over @xmath2-space operators which are all single - mode .",
    "therefore , analytical calculations are possible for some choices of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) .",
    "the observable @xmath0 can be kept general .",
    "the role of the product of traces over the modes of the bath in ( 6 ) is to induce decoherence which is recognized as essential for the measurement process.@xcite at time @xmath8 , the absolute value of this product should approach @xmath32 in the limit of large @xmath15 .",
    "let us now assume that the bath is bosonic .",
    "the hamiltonian of each mode is then @xmath33 , where for simplicity we shifted the zero of the oscillator energy to the ground state . the coupling operator @xmath13 is usually selected as @xmath34 . for simplicity ,",
    "though , we will assume that the coefficients @xmath35 are real :    @xmath36    for example , for radiation field in a unit volume , coupled to an atom,@xcite the coupling is via a linear combination of the operators @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "for a spatial oscillator , these are proportional to position and momentum , respectively .",
    "our calculations can be extended to have an imaginary part of @xmath35 which adds interaction with momentum .",
    "in order to calculate traces in ( 6 ) , we utilize the coherent - state formalism.@xcite the coherent states @xmath39 are the eigenstates of the annihilation operator @xmath40 with complex eigenvalues @xmath41 .",
    "note that from now on we omit the oscillator index @xmath3 whenever this leads to no confusion .",
    "these states are not orthogonal :    @xmath42    they form an over - complete set , and one can show that the identity operator in a single - oscillator space can be obtained as the integral    @xmath43    here the integration by definition corresponds to    @xmath44    furthermore , for an arbitrary operator @xmath45 , we have , in a single - oscillator space ,    @xmath46    finally , we note the following identity,@xcite which will be used later ,    @xmath47   \\ ; . \\eqno(12)\\ ] ]    in this relation @xmath48 is an arbitrary c - number , while @xmath49 denotes normal ordering .",
    "it is convenient to introduce operators @xmath50 according to    @xmath51    denoting the @xmath3th term in the second product in ( 6 ) by @xmath52 and utilizing relations ( 8)-(12 ) , we have    @xmath53    here we again omitted the mode index @xmath3 for simplicity , and @xmath54 stands for @xmath55 . the normal - ordering formula ( 12 )",
    "then yields for the middle term ,    @xmath56 }   \\ ; . \\eqno",

    "thus , for the first matrix element in ( 14 ) , for instance , we get    @xmath62 [ z_1+\\lambda b{g/(\\hbar\\omega ) } ] }   \\ ; . \\eqno",
    "( 18)\\ ] ]    collecting all the results , one concludes that the calculation of @xmath63 involves six gaussian integrations over the real and imaginary parts of the variables @xmath64 .",
    "this is a rather lengthy calculation but it can be carried out in closed form .",
    "the result , with indices @xmath3 restored , is    @xmath65 \\ ; , \\eqno(19)\\ ] ]    with    @xmath66    we only gave the expression for the absolute value of the product of traces in ( 6 ) .",
    "its complex phase is also known@xcite but plays no role in our considerations . in the next section",
    "we analyze the results ( 19)-(20 ) in the continuum limit of a large number of modes .",
    "results of the preceding section suggest that the off - diagonal elements of the effective density matrix , obtained after tracing over a bath , are generally decreased by the interaction with the bath modes .",
    "we will shortly demonstrate that in the limit of many bath modes , these off - diagonal elements irreversibly decay , thus leaving the system and the pointer in a statistical mixture of direct - product states .",
    "this process is usually termed decoherence .",
    "apart from being of fundamental importance in the theory of quantum measurement , decoherence has attracted much interest recently due to rapid development of new fields such as quantum computing and quantum information.@xcite decoherence due to external interactions is a major obstacle to implementation of coherently evolving quantum devices such as quantum computers . in this section",
    "we review some aspects of the physics of decoherence.@xcite    decoherence is a result of the coupling of the quantum system to the environment which , generally , is the rest of the universe . in various experimentally relevant situations interaction of a quantum system with environment is dominated / mediated by its microscopic surroundings that can be represented by a set of modes . for example , the dominant source of such interaction for an atom in an electromagnetic cavity field is the field itself coupled to the dipole moment of the atom.@xcite in the case of josephson junction in a magnetic flux@xcite or defect propagation in solids , the interaction can be dominated by acoustic phonons or delocalized electrons .",
    "magnetic macromolecules interact with the surrounding spin environment such as nuclear spins,@xcite etc .",
    "it is customary@xcite to model a heat bath as a system of noninteracting boson modes .",
    "it has been established , for harmonic quantum systems , that the influence of the heat bath described by the oscillators is effectively identical to an external uncorrelated random force acting on a quantum system under consideration . in order for the system to satisfy equation of motion with a linear dissipation term , in the classical limit",
    ", the coupling was chosen to be linear in coordinates while the coupling constants entered lumped in a spectral function , such as ( 20 ) , and were assumed to be of a power - law form in the oscillator frequency , with the appropriate debye cutoff .",
    "the temperature was introduced via the initial thermal state of the bath , as in ( 3 ) .",
    "this model of a heat bath was applied to study effects of dissipation on the probability of quantum tunneling from a metastable state.@xcite it was found that coupling a quantum system to the heat bath actually decreased the quantum tunneling rate .",
    "the problem of a particle in a double well potential was also considered.@xcite in this case the interaction with the bath lead to quantum decoherence and complete localization at zero temperature .",
    "this study has lead to the spin - boson hamiltonian@xcite which found numerous other applications .    for a general system",
    ", there is no systematic way to separate decoherence and thermalization effects .",
    "we note that thermalization is naturally associated with exchange of energy between the quantum system and heat bath .",
    "model system results and general expectations mentioned earlier suggest that in many cases decoherence involves its own time scales which are shorter than those of approach to thermal equilibrium.@xcite our measurement model represents , in fact , a limiting case such that there is no energy exchange between the system and the bath .",
    "this situation essentially corresponds to the early stages of the system - bath interaction , at low temperatures , when thermalization effects are not yet significant .",
    "thus if we ignore the presence of the pointer ( set @xmath67 ) , and restore the system hamiltonian @xmath1 in ( 1 ) , then our model of the system - bath interaction , with @xmath68 , now with @xmath69 but still with _ commuting _ @xmath1 and @xmath0 , corresponds to adiabatic quantum decoherence.@xcite indeed , the commutation property means that @xmath70=0 $ ] , so that the system energy is conserved and therefore relaxation is generally suppressed . only decoherence processes are possible and in fact exactly calculable.@xcite the results ( 19)-(20 ) remain unchanged and indicate that decoherence is controlled by the interaction with the bath , @xmath0 , rather than by the system hamiltonian .",
    "the eigenvalues of the `` pointer observable '' @xmath0 determine the rate of decoherence , while the type of the bath and coupling determines the function @xmath71 .",
    "we also note that @xmath71 is a sum of positive terms . for true decoherence ,",
    "i.e. , in order for this sum to diverge for _ large _ times , one needs a continuum of frequencies and interactions with the bath modes that are strong enough at low frequencies.@xcite we will give specific results shortly . for quantum measurement , thought , the time @xmath8 need not be large .",
    "the conditions for decoherence are then somewhat different ; see below .    in the continuum limit of many modes ,",
    "the density of the bosonic bath states in unit volume , @xmath72 , and the debye cutoff , with frequency @xmath73 , are introduced@xcite so that ( 20 ) can be rewritten as    @xmath74    let us consider the usual choice,@xcite motivated by atomic - physics@xcite and solid - state applications,@xcite corresponding to    @xmath75 where @xmath48 is a constant .",
    "exponent values @xmath76 and @xmath77 have been analyzed in detail in the literature.@xcite for @xmath76 , three regimes were identified , defined by the time scale for thermal decoherence , @xmath78 , which is large for low temperatures , and the time scale for quantum - fluctuation effects , @xmath79 .",
    "the first,@xcite `` quiet '' regime , @xmath80 , corresponds to no significant decoherence and @xmath81 .",
    "the next , `` quantum '' regime , @xmath82 , corresponds to decoherence driven by quantum fluctuations and @xmath83 .",
    "finally , for @xmath84 , in the `` thermal '' regime , thermal fluctuations are dominant and @xmath85 . for @xmath77 ,",
    "decoherence is incomplete.@xcite indeed , while @xmath86 must be positive for the integral in ( 21 ) to converge , only for @xmath87 we have divergent @xmath88 growing according to a power law for large times ( in fact ,",
    "@xmath89 ) in the `` thermal '' regime .",
    "thus , strong enough coupling @xmath90 to the low - frequency modes of the heat bath is crucial for full decoherence .",
    "let us concentrate on the @xmath76 case , motivated by atomic physics@xcite and solid - state applications;@xcite it is termed ohmic dissipation .",
    "we will now consider conditions for decoherence required for quantum measurement .",
    "these are somewhat different from those just discussed for the large - time adiabatic system - bath interaction effects . here",
    "we assume that the relevant energy gaps of @xmath1 are bounded so that there exists a well defined time scale @xmath91 of the evolution of the system under @xmath1 .",
    "there is also the time scale @xmath92 set by the frequency cutoff assumed for the interactions .",
    "the thermal time scale is @xmath93 .",
    "the only real limitation on the duration of measurement is that @xmath8 must be less then @xmath94 . in applications",
    ", typically@xcite one can assume that @xmath95 .",
    "furthermore , it is customary to assume that the temperature is low,@xcite    @xmath96    in the limit of large @xmath78 , for ohmic dissipation , ( 19 ) reduces to    @xmath97 \\right\\ } \\ ; . \\eqno(24)\\ ] ]    in order to achieve effective decoherence , the product @xmath98 $ ] must be large .",
    "the present approach only applies to operators @xmath0 with nonzero scale of the smallest spectral gaps , @xmath99 .",
    "we thus note that , unlike the large - time system - bath decoherence , the decoherence property needed for the measurement process will be obtained for nearly any well - behaved choice of @xmath100 because we can rely on the value of @xmath15 being large rather than on the properties of the function @xmath88 , which can no longer be considered evaluated at large @xmath8 . if @xmath15 can be large enough , very short measurement times @xmath8 are possible .",
    "however , it may be advisable to use measurement times @xmath101 to get the extra amplification factor @xmath102 and allow for fuller decoherence and less sensitivity to the value of @xmath8 in the pointer part of the dynamics , to be addressed in the next section .",
    "we notice , furthermore , that the assumption of a large number of modes is important for the monotonic decay of the absolute value ( 19 ) in the `` system - bath '' decoherence applications,@xcite where irreversibility is obtained only in the limit of the infinite number of modes . in the measurement case , it can be shown@xcite that the role of such a continuum limit is mainly to allow to extend the possible measurement times from @xmath103 to @xmath104 .",
    "consider the reduced density matrix @xmath27 of @xmath28 , with matrix elements given by ( 6 ) .",
    "it becomes diagonal in @xmath105 , at time @xmath8 , because all the nondiagonal elements are small , assuming that effective decoherence has been achieved , as discussed in the preceding section :      thus , the dynamics yields the density matrix that can be interpreted as describing a statistically distributed system ( a mixture ) , without quantum correlations .",
    "this , however , is only meaningful within the ensemble interpretation of quantum mechanics . for a single system plus device , coupling to the rest of the universe is presumably needed to describe how that system is left in one of the eigenstates @xmath107 , with probability @xmath108 . presently , such a process of wavefunction collapse is not fully understood,@xcite but see comments below on the implications of our model for this problem .",
    "after the measurement interaction is switched off at @xmath8 , the pointer of that system will carry information on the value of @xmath109 .",
    "this information is `` amplified , '' owing to the large parameter @xmath16 in the interaction .",
    "we note that one of the roles of the pointer having many modes , which can be identical and noninteracting , is to allow it ( the pointer only ) to still be treated in the ensemble , density matrix description , even if we focus on the late stage of the measurement when the wave functions of a single measured system and of each pointer mode are already collapsed .",
    "this pointer density matrix can be read off ( 25 ) ; it is the @xmath109-dependent product over the pointer modes labeled by @xmath6 .",
    "another useful insight is provided by the fact that , as will be shown shortly , the changes in the expectation values of some observables of the pointer retain amplified information on the system eigenstate .",
    "the coupling to the rest of the universe that leads to the completion of the measurement process , should involve such an observable of the pointer .",
    "eventually , the information in the pointer , perhaps after several steps of amplification , should be available for probe by interactions with classical devices .    at time",
    "@xmath9 , expectation values of various operators of the pointer will have their initial values .",
    "these values will be changed at time @xmath8 of the measurement owing to the interaction with the measured system .",
    "it is expected that the large coupling parameter @xmath16 will yield large changes in expectation values of the pointer quantities .",
    "this does not apply equally to all operators in the @xmath5-space .",
    "let us begin with the simplest choice : the hamiltonian @xmath110 of the pointer .",
    "we will assume that the pointer is described by the bosonic heat bath and , for simplicity , use the same notation for the pointer modes as that used for the bath modes .",
    "the assumption that the pointer modes are initially thermalized , see ( 3 ) , was not used thus far . while it allows exact analytical calculations , it is not essential : the effective density matrix describing the pointer modes at time @xmath8 , for the system state @xmath109 , will retain amplified information on the value of @xmath109 for general initial states of the pointer .",

    "furthermore , we see here the advantage of larger measurement times , @xmath118 .",
    "the change in the energy then reaches saturation .",
    "after time @xmath8 , when the interaction is switched off , the energy of the pointer will be conserved , internally , i.e. , until the pointer is affected by the `` rest of the universe . ''",
    "the change in the expectation value is linear in @xmath109 .",
    "however , this operator is not conserved internally .",
    "one can show that after time @xmath8 its expectation value decays to zero for times @xmath123 .",
    "we note that by referring to `` unit volume '' we have avoided the discussion of the `` extensivity '' of various quantities .",
    "for example , the initial energy @xmath124 is obviously proportional to the system volume , @xmath125 .",
    "however , the change @xmath126 will not be extensive ; typically , @xmath127 , @xmath128 . thus , while the amplification in our measurement process can involve a numerically large factor , the changes in the quantities of the pointer will be multiples of microscopic values .",
    "multi - stage amplification , or huge coupling parameter @xmath16 , would be needed for the information in the pointer to become truly `` extensive '' macroscopically .    in summary",
    ", we described the first stage of a measurement process .",
    "it involves decoherence due to a bath and transfer of information to a large system ( pointer ) via strong interaction over a short period of time .",
    "the pointer itself need not be coupled to the internal bath . while we do not offer a solution to the foundation - of - quantum - mechanics wave - function collapse problem,@xcite our results do provide two interesting observations .",
    "firstly , the pointer operator `` probed '' by the rest of the universe during the wave - function collapse stage , determined by how the pointer modes are coupled to the external bath,@xcite must have the appropriate amplification capacity in the first , decoherence stage of the measurement process , as illustrated by our calculations .    secondly , for a single system ( rather then an ensemble ) , the multiplicity of the ( noninteracting ) pointer modes might allow the pointer to be treated within the density matrix formalism even after the system and each pointer - mode wave functions were collapsed .",
    "since it is the information in the pointer that is passed on , this observation might seem to resolve part of the measurement puzzle .",
    "specifically , it might suggest why only those density matrices entering ( 25 ) are selected for the pointer : they carry classical ( large , different from other values ) information in expectation values , rather than quantum - mechanical superposition .",

    "the latter transference hopefully makes the wavefunction collapse and transfer of the stored information to the macroscopic level less `` mysterious . ''",
    "the second type of pointer will involve strongly interacting modes and play the role of an amplifier by utilizing the many - body collective behavior of the coupled modes , phase - transition style .",
    "its role will be to alleviate the requirement for large mode - to - system coupling parameters encountered in our model .",

    "<S> interaction of the system with the bath leads to decoherence such that the system and the pointer both evolve into a statistical mixture state described by the density matrix such that the system is in one of the eigenstates of @xmath0 with the correct quantum mechanical probability , whereas the expectation values of pointer operators retain amplified information on that eigenstate . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this process represents the initial step of a quantum measurement . </S>",
    "<S> calculation of the elements of the reduced density matrix of the system and pointer is carried out exactly , and time dependence of decoherence is identified . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss general implications of our model of energy - conserving coupling to a heat bath for processes of adiabatic quantum decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> we also evaluate changes in the expectation values of certain pointer operators and suggest that these can be interpreted as macroscopic indicators of the measurement outcome . </S>"
