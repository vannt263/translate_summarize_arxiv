    "one of the most puzzling problems nowadays in physics is the issue of the late - time acceleration of the universe @xcite . a possible approach to tackle this problem is within the frame - work of self - accelerating universes @xcite ; i.e. could a modification of gravity at late - time and on large scale be the cause of the current inflationary phase of the universe ?",
    "in other words , could this modification of gravity on large scales provide an _ effective negative pressure _ that would fuel the late - time acceleration of the universe ?    a possible approach to tackle these questions is the dvali , gabadadze and porrati ( dgp ) scenario @xcite , which corresponds to a five - dimensional ( 5d ) model . in this model ,",
    "our universe is a brane ; i.e. a 4d hyper - surface , embedded in a flat space - time .",
    "the dgp model has two types of solutions : the self - accelerating branch and the normal one .",
    "the self - accelerating brane is asymptotically de sitter .",
    "this feature takes place without invoking any unknown dark energy component . on the other hand",
    ", the normal branch requires a dark energy component to accommodate the current observations @xcite . despite the nice features of the self - accelerating dgp branch",
    ", it suffers from serious theoretical problems like the ghost issue @xcite . in this paper",
    "we propose a mechanism to self - accelerate the normal branch which is known to be free from the ghost issue @xcite .",
    "this mechanism will be based on a modified hilbert - einstein action on the brane @xcite and the simplest gravitational option is an @xmath0 term @xcite .",
    "we consider a brane , described by a 4d hyper - surface ( @xmath1 , metric g ) , embedded in a 5d bulk space - time ( @xmath2 , metric @xmath3 ) , whose action is given by @xmath4\\;\\right\\}%\\nonumber \\\\",

    ", @xmath8 is the scalar curvature of the induced metric on the brane , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is a constant that measures the strength of the generalised induced gravity term @xmath0 and has mass square units .",
    "notice that therefore the function @xmath0 has mass square units .",
    "finally , @xmath11 corresponds to the matter lagrangian of the brane .",
    "we will assume that the brane splits the bulk in two symmetric pieces .",
    "the previous action , includes as a particular case the dgp model @xcite for @xmath12 and @xmath13 where @xmath14 is proportional to the 4d gravitational constant .",
    "it can be shown that the total energy density of the brane is conserved ( we refer the reader to @xcite for more details ) .",
    "in particular , the energy density of matter on the brane is conserved .    in what follows ,",
    "we consider a homogeneous and isotropic brane .",
    "the matter sector on the brane can be described by a perfect fluid with energy density @xmath15 and pressure @xmath16 , where @xmath15 is conserved as we have pointed above . on the other hand ,",

    "the energy density is conserved on the brane .",
    "the modified friedmann equation on the brane can be written as @xmath20 while , the spatial component of einstein equation can be expressed as @xmath21 where the energy density @xmath22 and the pressure @xmath23 are defined as @xmath24    for simplicity , on equations ( [ friedmann ] ) and ( [ rhop ] ) we have used the spatially flat chart of the brane .",
    "a de sitter universe is the simplest cosmological solution that exhibits acceleration and therefore it is worthwhile to prove the existence of this solution in our model and study its stability .",
    "this would be a first step towards describing in a realistic way the late - time acceleration of the universe in an @xmath0 brane - world model .",
    "this approach will also enable us to look for self - accelerating solutions on the modified normal dgp branch .",
    "so , in this section , we first obtain the fixed points of the model corresponding to a de sitter space - time and then we study their stability under homogeneous perturbations .      in our model , the hubble parameter for de sitter solutions can be expressed as term we will disregard the matter content in our analysis of de sitter branes . ]",

    "we recover the dgp model for @xmath12 .",
    "in fact , in that case , the de sitter self - accelerating dgp branch is obtained for @xmath29 and the normal dgp branch or the non - self - accelerating solution for @xmath30 .",
    "when the brane action contains curvature corrections to the hilbert - einstein action given by the brane scalar curvature , the branch with @xmath30 is no longer flat and accelerates ( cf .",
    "[ ploth ] ) .",
    "therefore , an @xmath0 term on the brane action induce in a natural way self - acceleration on the normal branch .",
    "most importantly , it is known that such a branch is free from the ghost problem ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the reason behind the self - acceleration of the generalised normal brane is the presence of the effective energy density @xmath31 on the modified friedmann equation on the brane .",

    "if we assume that we are close to the 4d regime ; i.e. the hubble rate of the brane is close to its analogous quantity in a 4d @xmath0 model , then @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "consequently , @xmath42 tends to make the perturbation heavier .",
    "however , the perturbative effect encoded on @xmath43 would make the perturbation lighter .",
    "it can be shown that the extra - dimension has a _ benigner _ effect in the 4d f(r ) model ; i.e. @xmath46 , as long as ; i.e. the effective gravitational constant of the brane is positive . on the other hand , we have also assumed that we are slightly perturbing the hilbert - einstein action of the brane , i.e. @xmath47 .",
