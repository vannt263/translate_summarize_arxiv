    "the problem of solving the power flow equations that describe a power system , i.e. computing the steady state of the grid ( typically the bus voltages ) given the state of power generators and loads , is among the most classical tasks in circuit and power system theory .",
    "an analytic solution of the power flow equations is typically not available , given their nonlinear nature .",
    "for this reason , notable effort has been devoted to the design of numerical methods to solve systems of power flow equations , to be used both in offline analysis of a grid and in real time monitoring and control of the system ( see for example the review in @xcite ) .",
    "specific tools have been derived for the approximate solution of such equations , based on some assumptions on the grid parameters .",
    "in particular , if the power lines are mostly inductive , equations relating active power flows and bus voltage angles result to be approximately linear , and decoupled from the reactive power flow equations , resulting in the _ dc power flow model _ ( see the review in @xcite , and the more recent discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "we focus here on a specific scenario , which is the power distribution grid .",
    "more specifically , we are considering a balanced medium voltage grid which is connected to the power transmission grid in one point ( the distribution substation , or pcc , point of common coupling ) , and which hosts loads and possibly also microgenerators .",
    "power distribution grids have recently been the object of an unprecedented interest .",
    "its operation has become more challenging since the deployment of distributed microgeneration and the appearance of larger constant - power loads ( electric vehicles in particular ) .",
    "these challenges motivated the deployment of ict ( information and communications technology ) in the power distribution grid , in the form of sensing , communication , and control devices , in order to operate the grid more efficiently , safely , reliably , and within the its voltage and power constraints .",
    "these applications have been reviewed in @xcite , and include real - time feedback control @xcite , automatic reconfiguration @xcite , and load scheduling @xcite . in order to design the control and optimization algorithms for these applications , an analytic ( rather than numerical ) solution of the power flow equations",
    "would be extremely convenient .",
    "unfortunately , because in the medium voltage grid the power lines are not purely inductive , power flow equations include both the active and reactive power injection / demands , and both the voltage angles and magnitudes , in an entangled way .",
    "the explicit dc power flow model therefore does not apply well .",
    "the contribution of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we give sufficient conditions for the existence of a practical solution of the nonlinear power flow equations in power distribution networks ( theorem  [ theo : taylor_expansion_complex ] ) .",
    "second , we derive a tractable approximate solution to the power flow problem , linear in the complex power injections , providing a bound on the approximation error ( corollary  [ cor : approx ] ) .    in the remainder of this section , we review relevant related works . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    ", we present the nonlinear equations that define the power flow problem . in section  [ sec : main ] we present our main existence result , together with the linear approximate solution .",
    "we illustrate such approximation via simulations in section  [ sec : simulations ] , and we compare it with the classical dc power flow model in section  [ sec : dcpower ] , where we also show how to incorporate voltage controlled ( pv ) buses .",
    "conditions have been derived in order to guarantee the existence of a solution to the power flow equations in the scenario of a grid of nonlinear loads .",
    "many results are based on the degree theory @xcite . in @xcite , for example , exponential model is adopted for the loads , and sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution are derived .",
    "these conditions are however quite restrictive , and do not include constant power ( pq ) buses . in @xcite , on the other hand , the existence of a solution is proved by exploiting the radial structure of the grid , via an iterative procedure which is closely related to a class of iterative numerical methods specialized for the power distribution networks @xcite .",
    "the existence of solutions to the power flow equations has been also studied in order to characterize the security region of a grid , i.e. the set of power injections and demands that yield acceptable voltages across the network .",
    "these results include @xcite , and others where however the decoupling between active and reactive power flows is assumed @xcite .",
    "other works in which the dc power flow assumption plays a key role are @xcite and @xcite , both focused on active power flows across the grid . on the other hand , the results in @xcite focus on the reactive power flows and on the voltage magnitudes at the buses .    in @xcite",
    "the implicit function theorem is used in order to advocate the existence of a power flow solution , without providing an approximate expression for that .",
    "it is worth noticing that the linear approximate model that we are presenting in this paper shares some similarities with the method of _ power distribution factors _",
    "@xcite , which allow to express variations in the state ( voltage angles ) as a linear function of active power perturbations .",
    "this method is also typically based on the dc power flow assumptions , even if a formulation in rectangular coordinates ( therefore modeling reactive power flows ) has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "notice that , except for the seminal works on power distribution factors @xcite , and the more recent results in @xcite , most of the related results consists in algorithms that allow to compute this factors only numerically , from the jacobian of the power flow equations .",
    "the approximate power flow solution proposed in this paper has been presented in a preliminary form in @xcite , where however no guarantees on the existence of such solution and on the quality of the approximation were given .",
    "we are considering a portion of a symmetric and balanced power distribution network , connected to the grid at one point , delivering power to a number of buses , each one hosting loads and possibly also microgenerators .",
    "we denote by @xmath0 the set of buses , where the index @xmath1 refers to the pcc .",
    "we limit our study to the steady state behavior of the system , when all voltages and currents are sinusoidal signals at the same frequency .",
    "each signal can therefore be represented via a complex number @xmath2 whose absolute value @xmath3 corresponds to the signal root - mean - square value , and whose phase @xmath4 corresponds to the phase of the signal with respect to an arbitrary global reference .    in this notation ,",
    "the steady state of the network is described by the voltage @xmath5 and by the injected current @xmath6 at each node @xmath7 .",
    "we define the vectors @xmath8 , with entries @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "each bus @xmath7 of the network is characterized by a law relating its injected current @xmath10 with its voltage @xmath9 .",
    "we model bus @xmath1 as a _ slack node _ , in which a voltage is imposed @xmath11 where @xmath12 are such that @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we model all the other nodes as pq buses , in which the injected complex power ( active and reactive powers ) is imposed and does not depend on the bus voltage .",
    "this model describes the steady state of most loads , and also the behavior of microgenerators , that are typically connected to the grid via power inverters @xcite .",
    "according to the pq model , we have that , at every bus , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the imposed complex power .",
    "a more compact way to write these nonlinear power flow equations is the following .",
    "let the vectors @xmath17 be vectors in @xmath18 having @xmath19 , @xmath20 as entries .",
    "then we have @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the vector whose entries are the complex conjugates of the entries of @xmath23 and where @xmath24 denotes a diagonal matrix having the entries of the vector as diagonal elements .",
    "we model the grid power lines via their nodal admittance matrix @xmath25 , which gives a linear relation between bus voltages and currents , in the form @xmath26    in the rest of the paper , we assume that the shunt admittances at the buses are negligible . therefore the nodal admittance matrix satisfies @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the vector of all ones . under this assumption",
    ", the matrix @xmath29 corresponds to the weighted laplacian of the graph describing the grid , with edge weights equal to the admittance of the corresponding power lines .",
    "we will show in a remark in section  [ sec : main ] how this assumption can be relaxed , so that the entire analysis can be extended seamlessly to the case in which shunt admittances of the lines are not negligible .",
    "considering the same partitioning of the vectors @xmath30 as before , we can partition the admittance matrix @xmath29 accordingly , and rewrite as @xmath31= \\left[\\begin{array}{cc } y_{0 0}&y_{0 \\lnodes}\\\\y_{\\lnodes 0}&y_{\\lnodes \\lnodes}\\end{array}\\right ] \\left[\\begin{array}{c } v_0\\\\v_\\lnodes\\end{array}\\right].\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is invertible because , if the graph representing the grid is a connected graph , then @xmath28 is the only vector in the null space of @xmath29 @xcite . using",
    "we then obtain @xmath33 where the impedance matrix @xmath34 is defined as @xmath35    objective of the power flow analysis is to determine from these equations the voltages @xmath9 and the currents @xmath10 as functions of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , namely @xmath38 in general , because of the nonlinear nature of the loads , we may have no solution or more than one solution for fixed @xmath36 and @xmath16 , as the following simple example shows .    consider the simplest grid made by two nodes , node @xmath1 being the slack bus ( where we let @xmath39 ) , and node @xmath40 being a pq bus . in this case",
    "we have that the following equations have to be satisfied @xmath41 assume that @xmath42 , and that @xmath43 is real .",
    "the system of equations can then be solved analytically .",
    "in fact it can be found that if @xmath44 there are no solutions .",
    "when on the contrary @xmath45 , there are two distinct solutions @xmath46 notice that , if @xmath47 is large , then the solutions exist and , since @xmath48 , the current @xmath49 take the two values @xmath50 therefore , when @xmath47 is large , one solution consists in small currents ( thus small power losses and voltage close to the nominal voltage across all the network ) , while the other consists in larger currents , larger power losses , and larger voltage drops .",
    "of course , the system should be controlled so that it works at the first working point .",
    "the intuition from this simple example is developed in the next section , where the existence and uniqueness of a practical solution to the power flow equations ( i.e. a solution at which the grid can practically and reliably be operated ) is studied , and an approximate power flow solution ( linear in the power terms ) is proposed .",
    "define @xmath51 so that we have @xmath52    by putting together with and , we get @xmath53\\\\ & = f+s_\\lnodes+\\frac{1}{v_0 ^ 2}\\operatorname{diag } ( f+s_\\lnodes ) \\x ( \\bar f+\\bar s_\\lnodes),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and therefore @xmath54    we can determine a ball where there exists a unique solution @xmath55 to this equation by applying the banach fixed point theorem @xcite . in order to do so , define the function @xmath56    consider the standard 2-norm @xmath57 on @xmath58 defined as @xmath59 let us then define the following matrix normon @xmath60 @xmath61 where the notation @xmath62 stands for the @xmath7-th row of @xmath63 .",
    "the following result holds .",
    "consider the vector 2-norm @xmath57 on @xmath64 , and the matrix norm @xmath65 defined in . if @xmath66 then there exists a unique solution @xmath67 of the power flow equations and in the form @xmath68 where @xmath69 is such that @xmath70 [ theo : taylor_expansion_complex ]    let @xmath71 and @xmath72 . in order to apply the banach fixed point theorem ,",
    "we need to show that , under the hypotheses of the theorem , @xmath73 for a suitable constant @xmath74 .",
    "we prove first .",
    "observe that , by using lemma  [ lem : pnorm ] in the case @xmath75 , we have @xmath76 where we used the fact that @xmath77 .",
    "now , using the definition of @xmath78 and lemma  [ lemma ] in the appendix ( with @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) we can argue that , if is true , then @xmath81    we prove now .",
    "it is enough to notice that , by applying lemma  [ lem : f ] in the appendix ( with @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) we obtain that @xmath85 where @xmath86 finally , notice that by using we obtain @xmath87    now from and , by applying the banach fixed point theorem , we can argue that there exists unique solution @xmath88 of equation .",
    "then by using and we have that @xmath89 in order to prove it is enough to define @xmath90 .    the norm @xmath91 can be put in direct relation with the induced matrix 2-norm @xmath92 , and with structural properties of the graph that describes the power grid .",
    "indeed @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the @xmath7-th vector of the canonical base .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath95 $ ] is one possible pseudoinverse of the weighted laplacian @xmath29 of the grid .",
    "therefore we have that @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the second smallest singular value of @xmath29 ( the smallest one being zero ) . in the special case in which all the power lines have the same @xmath98 ratio ( i.e. their impedances have the same angle , but different magnitudes ) , then @xmath97 corresponds also to the second smallest eigenvalue of the laplacian , which is a well known metric for the graph connectivity . given this relation between @xmath91 and @xmath92 ,",
    "the assumption in theorem  [ theo : taylor_expansion_complex ] is satisfied if @xmath99 this condition resembles similar results that have been proposed for example in @xcite for the analysis of the feasibility of the power flow problem .",
    "interestingly , the role of similar spectral connectivity measures of the grid has been recently investigated also for grid synchronization and resilience problems ( see the discussion in @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .    [",
    "cor : approx ] consider the vector 2-norm @xmath57 on @xmath64 , and the matrix norm @xmath65 defined in .",
    "let the assumption of theorem  [ theo : taylor_expansion_complex ] be satisfied .",
    "then the solution @xmath67 of the power flow nonlinear equations is approximated by @xmath100 and the approximation error satisfies @xmath101 where , as before , @xmath102 is the @xmath7-th row of @xmath103 .",
    "we have , from , for any bus @xmath104 , @xmath105 by using cauchy - schwarz inequality and the bound we obtain .",
    "theorem  [ theo : taylor_expansion_complex ] and corollary  [ cor : approx ] can be interpreted as a way to model the grid as a linear relation between the variables @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "in fact , power flow equations already contain the simple linear relation between the variables @xmath108 and @xmath106 , together with an implicit nonlinear relation between @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the previous results say that , in case @xmath107 is sufficiently small , there is a way to make the relation between @xmath106 and @xmath107 explicit ( theorem  [ theo : taylor_expansion_complex ] ) , and to find a linear approximated relation between these variables ( corollary  [ cor : approx ] ) . this interpretation will be further elaborated in section  [ sec : dcpower ] , in order to extend the model to grids where voltage regulated ( pv ) nodes are present .",
    "notice moreover that the approximate model   can be manipulated , via premultiplication by the admittance matrix @xmath29 , in order to obtain the sparse linear equation @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath107 are the augmented vectors @xmath111 $ ] and @xmath112 $ ] , respectively .",

    "the grid model in which the matrix @xmath29 is assumed to satisfy is based on the assumption of zero nodal shunt admittances . in the case",
    "in which shunt admittances are not negligible , the proposed analysis can be modified accordingly . in this more general case",

    "consider the standard p - norm @xmath123 on @xmath64 defined as @xmath124 if @xmath125 and by @xmath126",

    "it can be inferred from that , as power line impedances have positive resistance and reactance , @xmath136 therefore @xmath137 , which , in a radial network , is the length of the path ( in terms of the magnitude of the path impedance ) connecting bus @xmath7 to bus @xmath1 .",

    "[ fig : voltage ] we also reported the bounds and on the approximation error ( as a solid and dashed curve , respectively ) .",

    "these simulations are available online @xcite , together with the source code used to generate them , and a selection of them is included hereafter .    in a first case ,",
    "the active and reactive power demand of all loads has been doubled , in order to simulate a uniform overload of the grid .",
    "the uniform scaling of the vector of power demands @xmath107 affects in the same way ( i.e. quadratically ) both the approximation bounds and .",
    "while the bounds are still conservetive , figure  [ fig : voltage_overload ] shows that the approximation error is indeed larger compared to nominal case .    in a second case ,",
    "the demand of one single bus ( bus 32 ) has been increased to 2 mw of active power and 1 mvar of reactive power , i.e. 50 times the original demand .",

    "<S> we consider the problem of deriving an explicit approximate solution of the nonlinear power equations that describe a balanced power distribution network . we give sufficient conditions for the existence of a practical solution to the power flow equations , and we propose an approximation that is linear in the active and reactive power demands of the pq buses . </S>",
    "<S> for this approximation , which is valid for generic power line impedances and grid topology , we derive a bound on the approximation error as a function of the grid parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the quality of the approximation via simulations , we show how it can also model the presence of voltage controlled ( pv ) buses , and we discuss how it generalizes the dc power flow model to lossy networks .    </S>",
