    "quasiparticles in anisotropically - paired superconductors can experience a variation , e.g. a sign change , of the order parameter upon reflection from an interface .",
    "then the interference between the incident and reflected quasiparticles results in the formation of bound states near the interface , with the energies inside the bulk energy gap , which are known as the andreev bound states ( abs).@xcite the abs manifest themselves in low - energy features , typically peaks , in the tunneling conductance , which have been observed experimentally .",
    "in particular , the zero - bias conductance peaks in high-@xmath1 cuprates exhibit strong dependence on the crystallographic orientation of the interface , consistent with the @xmath2-wave pairing , see ref . for a review .",

    "we neglect disorder and calculate the tunneling conductance using the blonder - tinkham - klapwijk ( btk ) formalism.@xcite the effect of the rashba soc on the conductance can be attributed to a modification of the boundary conditions for the wavefunctions at the interface .",
