    "noncommutative field theories @xcite are in general characterized by the replacement of familiar product of functions with noncommutative moyal star - product @xcite , as the simplest realization of the canonical commutation relation between space - time coordinates , @xmath2_{\\star}=i\\theta_{\\mu\\nu}$ ] .",
    "their deformed lagrangian densities can therefore be written as an infinite series in terms of higher order temporal and spatial derivative of functions . from this point of view",
    ", noncommutative field theories can be understood as a class of nonlocal higher - derivative field theories , which appear in other areas of physics too . as it is argued in @xcite , unconstrained ,",
    "nonlocal higher - derivative theories , having more degrees of freedom than lower - derivative theories , are dramatically different from their lower - derivative counterparts .",
    "nonlocal field theories appear , in general , as effective field theories in a low - energy limit of a larger theory .",
    "in particular , space - space noncommutative field theories describe the low energy effective field theories of string theory in a background magnetic field . in @xcite ,",
    "space - time noncommutative field theory is searched by considering open strings in a constant background electric field .",
    "it is shown that here , in contrast to the magnetic case , a critical electric field exists beyond which the theory does not make sense , and that this critical field prevents us from finding a limit in which the theory becomes a field theory on a noncommutative space - time . in so far , string theory does not admit a space - time noncommutative quantum field theory , as its low energy limit , with the exception of light - like noncommutativity @xcite . whereas space - space noncommutative field theories suffer from a mixing of ultraviolet and infrared singularities in their perturbative dynamics @xcite , space - time noncommutative theories in minkowski space seem to be seriously acausal and inconsistent with conventional hamiltonian evolution @xcite .",
    "besides their @xmath3-matrix fail to be unitary @xcite . in @xcite attempts",
    "are made to quantize theories with space - time noncommutativity , that leads , however , to inconsitencies .",
    "a path integral formulation of space - time noncommutativity using schwinger s action principle is introduced in @xcite , from which the canonical structure for higher derivative theory is recovered . using a simple field theory non - local in time , it is shown that the quantization on the basis of a naive interaction picture is not justified if the interaction contains non - local terms in time .",
    "it is shown that a unitary @xmath3-matrix can only be defined by using a modified time ordering , but the positive energy condition is spoiled together with a smooth wick rotation to euclidean theory . in @xcite , noncommutative qed in a 1 + 1 dimensional minkowski space",
    "is expanded in the order of the noncommutativity parameter @xmath4 up to @xmath5 .",
    "the resulting theory is non - local in time and can be considered as a higher derivative theory including only a finite number of time derivatives . using the method of perturbative quantization , it is then perturbatively quantized up to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the corresponding qed coupling constant .",
    "recently , in @xcite , space - time noncommutative field theories are examined in various pictures and quantization procedures .",
    "it is shown that different quantization procedures lead to inconsistencies when time is taken as noncommutative coordinate .",
    "the results in @xcite are consistent with the results in @xcite and with string theory which , as we have mentioned before , `` does not admit a space - time noncommutative quantum field theory , as its low energy limit , with the exception of light - like noncommutativity '' @xcite .    in this paper , we consider noncommutative qed in two - dimensional _",
    "euclidean space _",
    "( noncommutative qed@xmath8 ) , where the minkowski time @xmath9 is replaced by the euclidean imaginary time @xmath10 , and the canonical commutation relation between the coordinates is reduced to @xmath11=i\\theta\\epsilon_{ij}$ ] , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 the two - dimensional antisymmetric tensor .",
    "hence , in contrast to its minkowskian formulation , in the euclidean space the noncommutativity is defined between two `` equivalent '' spatial coordinates , and the noncommutative field theory based on this formulation is therefore free of the before mentioned problems of @xmath14 dimensional noncommutative field theories .    having a euclidean formulation of noncommutative qed@xmath8 , we are in particular interested in the mass spectrum of the theory , that plays the r@xmath15le of the noncommutative counterpart of the well - known schwinger model @xcite . originally introduced as a toy model to understand the confinement properties of strong interaction , the euclidean formulation of the schwinger model turns out to have many applications in system where the physics is effectively reduced to two spatial dimensions .",
    "one example of such a system is @xmath16 dimensional qed in the presence of constant magnetic fields . for strong enough magnetic fields , aligned in the third spatial direction ,",
    "it is known that , because of the phenomenon of magnetic catalysis @xcite , the system is reduced to a two - dimensional surface perpendicular to the direction of the external magnetic field .",
    "the dynamics of electrons and photons is then described effectively by a two - dimensional euclidean schwinger model , where in a mechanism similar to the higgs mechanism the photons acquire a finite mass @xmath17 , similar to the schwinger s photon mass @xmath18 .",
    "note that whereas in @xmath19 , @xmath7 is the dimensionless coupling constant of the @xmath16 dimensional qed , @xmath20 in @xmath21 is the dimensionful coupling constant of the two - dimensional qed .",
    "moreover , in @xmath19 , the magnetic length @xmath22 is defined by @xmath23 .",
    "remarkable , however , is the fact that the effective two - dimensional field theory in the presence of strong magnetic field can be effectively described by a deformed noncommutative field theory in two spatial dimensions , where , for @xmath24 , the commutation relation between the coordinates is given by @xmath11=\\kappa_{ij}$ ] with @xmath25 , @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this turns out to be similar to the corresponding relation in euclidean noncommutative schwinger model , with the noncommutativity parameter @xmath26 playing the r@xmath15le of the squared of the magnetic length @xmath22 .",
    "what concerns the noncommutative version of the euclidean schwinger model , we therefore expect that noncommutative photons acquire a finite mass , that depends in a non - trivial way on the dimensionful coupling constant @xmath20 and the noncommutativity parameter @xmath4 .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to determine these noncommutative corrections to the commutative photon mass @xmath21 .",
    "another point , which makes this problem far from trivial , is the fact that noncommutative qed@xmath8 has similar properties to commutative qcd@xmath8 .",
    "this is because of the presence of noncommutative star - products in the gauge kinetic term of the lagrangian density of the theory , including cubic and quartic couplings of noncommutative gauge fields , as in commutative qcd@xmath8 .",
    "moreover , the equation of motion of noncommutative qed@xmath8 includes , similar to commutative qcd@xmath8 , a covariant derivative of the noncommutative field strength tensor and is therefore non - linear in the gauge field . whereas in the commutative schwinger model",
    ", the photon mass @xmath21 is determined perturbatively from the pole of photon propagator , and turns out to be one - loop exact @xcite , the mass spectrum of qcd@xmath8 is non - trivial and looking for it has a long history .",
    "the mass spectrum of pure commutative two - dimensional single flavor @xmath27 model was first determined by t hooft @xcite , where in the @xmath28 limit a nearly straight regge trajectory of confined mesonic states was found .",
    "recently , the spectrum of multi - flavor commutative @xmath29 in two dimensions is determined in @xcite . here",
    ", the authors consider first a ( commutative ) gauged bosonized action equivalent to qcd@xmath8 action , that consists of a free wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) part , a gauge kinetic part and an appropriate interaction part including the wzw and gauge fields .",
    "using then the light - cone momentum operator , depending on the mesonic currents , they derive a t hooft - like mass eigenvalue equation @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the wave function of `` currentball '' states of qcd@xmath8 in a hilbert space which is truncated to two - current states @xcite . solving this eigenvalue equation numerically , they arrive at the mass spectrum of qcd@xmath8 , that , in particular , in the limit of large @xmath32 , reduces to a single noninteracting meson with mass @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath34 copies of the commutative schwinger mass @xmath1 . in the present paper",
    ", we will closely follow the arguments of @xcite , and will determine the mass spectrum of noncommutative qed@xmath8 nonperturbatively .",
    "we will arrive at the quite unexpected result that the mass - spectrum of noncommutative qed@xmath8 does not receive any noncommutative correction and is therefore given by the spectrum of commutative qed@xmath8 , consisting of a single free meson with mass @xmath1 .",
    "we will show that this result is perturbatively exact in the noncommutativity parameter @xmath4 , and the noncommutative qed@xmath8 coupling constant @xmath20 .",
    "it is , however , limited to the two current sector of the hilbert space .",
    "this is in contrast with the results arising in @xcite . here",
    ", a noncommutative @xmath14 dimensional bosonized schwinger model is considered . using a perturbative seiberg - witten map @xcite",
    "up to first order in @xmath4 , it is then mapped into an equivalent gauge invariant commutative model .",
    "it is shown that the resulting deformed theory consists of a massive boson , which is , in contrast to its noncommutative counterpart , no longer free . the same noncommutative bosonized schwinger model , as in @xcite , is also considered in @xcite , where , in particular , the confinement - deconfienemt phase transition observed in commutative schwinger model is investigated .",
    "it is shown that though the fuzziness of space - time introduces new features in the confinement scenario , it does not affect the deconfining limit @xcite .",
    "schwinger model on fuzzy spheres is studied in @xcite .",
    "other exactly solvable noncommutative models are discussed recently in @xcite ( see also the references therein ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , after introducing the noncommutative qed@xmath8 model , we will determine the one - loop correction to photon mass by determining the pole of the corresponding photon propagator at one - loop level . in this order , although additional diagrams relative to commutative qed@xmath8 are to be taken into account and they can potentially contribute to the pole of the noncommutative photon propagator , the noncommutative photon mass , being the same as the commutative photon mass , receives no noncommutative corrections . to show that this result is one - loop exact",

    "although in noncommutative qed@xmath8 , in contrast to commutative qed@xmath8 , three additional feynman integrals are to be considered , it is shown that the pole of the noncommutative photon propagator remains unchanged at this one - loop level .",

    "following closely the method used in @xcite to determine the mass spectrum of qcd@xmath8 , we have first derived the gauged bosonized effective action corresponding to noncommutative qed@xmath8 , and its corresponding energy - momentum tensor in terms of noncommutative currents .",
    "solving then the corresponding mass eigenvalue equation , we have determined the mass spectrum of noncommutative qed@xmath8 , which turns out to be exactly the same as its commutative counterpart .    as we have argued in sec .",

    "we are therefore left with the same mass eigenvalue equation as in commutative qed@xmath8 .",
    "note that although the noncommutativity is fully incorporated in @xmath216 in terms of the star - product , in the light - cone gauge , they depend only on one of the coordinates @xmath174 [ see ( [ h21-c ] ) ] .",
    "this is the main reason why under the integral over @xmath174 the star - product appearing in the integrand of ( [ h32 ] ) can be removed between two @xmath236 s , leaving us with the same @xmath211 as in commutative schwinger model .",
    "being independent of @xmath237 , the fourier transform of @xmath236 depends only on @xmath238 .",
    "this was our motivation behind the particular choice of ( [ h33 ] ) as the eigenstate @xmath31 , which is restricted to two - current sector of the hilbert space as in @xcite .",
    "as for the second reason , it lies in the fact that the corresponding current algebra ( [ h35 ] ) of noncommutative qed@xmath8 , being independent of the noncommutativity parameter @xmath4 , is the same as in commutative qed@xmath8 .",
    "this noncommutative current algebra was particularly used in sec .",
    "iii.c to determine certain commutation relations of @xmath211 with the currents appearing in @xmath31 [ see ( [ h37 ] ) and ( [ h38 ] ) ] . the latter",
    "are then used to determine the mass spectrum ( [ h41 ] ) .",
    "it would be intriguing to study the effect of nonplanar diagrams on noncommutative photon mass .",
    "this can be realized by bosonizing noncommutative qed@xmath8 with _ invariant _ currents @xmath239 and @xmath240 from ( [ g4-b ] ) and ( [ g8 ] ) , in contrast to what is done in this paper .",
    "what changes is , in particular , the axial anomaly equation ( [ g10 ] ) , corresponding to the covariant current @xmath241 . as it is shown in @xcite the axial anomaly for invariant current @xmath240 receives contributions from _ nonplanar _ diagrams . together with the continuity equation , the anomaly equation ( [ g10 ] )",
    "is particularly used in this paper to determine the exact form of the currents @xmath117 in terms of the auxiliary field @xmath109 in the light - cone gauge @xmath118 [ see ( [ h4 ] ) ) ] .",
    "because of the form of nonplanar anomaly @xcite , requiring an additional ir regularization @xcite , the study of the effects of nonplanar feynman integrals on noncommutative photon mass is a non - trivial task and will be postponed to future publications .",
