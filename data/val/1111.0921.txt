    "our analytical results shed light on the phenomenon of hierarchical synchrony , characterized by synchronization on a local scale before it occurs on a global scale , which occurs when the community structure of the network is strong enough .",
    "the system analyzed in this paper modeled synchrony on a network with two community levels , but synchrony on networks with more levels , e.g. communities with subcommunities , can be modeled in a similar way and analogous analytical results can be obtained .",
    "although we have assumed strong uniform coupling within communities and weak uniform coupling between communities , we conjecture , based on preliminary numerical experiments , that the system studied in this paper is in some cases a good quantitative model for networks where links between oscillators in the same community are dense and links between oscillators in different communities are sparse .",
