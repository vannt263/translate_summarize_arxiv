    "the three - box paradox is an example presented by aharonov and vaidman @xcite of a pre- and post - selected quantum system that exhibits highly counter - intuitive behavior .",
    "it has become the focus of a long - lived debate , including attempts to demystify and refute the paradox ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "one such attempt in particular , presented by kirkpatrick @xcite , involves a `` classical analogue '' of the three - box paradox in the form of a card - game . in this paper",
    "we analyze the paradoxical features of the three - box experiment and argue that it does not have a classical analogue .",
    "we analyze kirkpatrick s card game and show that it does not reproduce the paradoxical features of the original three - box experiment .",
    "the paradox in the three - box experiment is that at a particular time we can claim that a particle is in some sense both with certainty in one box , @xmath0 , and with certainty in another box , @xmath1 .",
    "now , if a particle is certainly in @xmath0 , then it is certainly not in @xmath1 , and vice versa . therefore , if a single particle is both certainly in @xmath0 and certainly in @xmath1 we have a paradox . the difficulty is not unlike the one presented by a two - slit interference experiment , where we have to admit that a single particle passes simultaneously through two separated slits , but it is more acute . in the three - box experiment , the particle is _ certain _ to be found in @xmath0 if searched for in @xmath0 , and _ certain _ to be found in @xmath1 if searched for in @xmath1 instead .",
    "today we do not know of any real `` paradoxes '' in physics .",
    "a true physical paradox would be a prediction of a current physical theory that contradicts experimental results .",
    "such a paradox would necessitate a modification of the current theory , i.e. progress in physics .",
    "what we mean by `` quantum paradox '' is a phenomenon that _ classical _ physics can not explain .",
    "the three - box paradox describes a particular task that can not be accomplished using classical means .",
    "an example of this type of quantum paradox is the greenberger - horne - zeilinger @xcite ( ghz ) setup modified by mermin @xcite , in which a team equipped with quantum technology can win with certainty a game with separated players that can be won by a team employing classical ( relativistic ) physics only with probability 0.75 @xcite .",
    "the ghz game is one of numerous games @xcite based on quantum entanglement , a phenomenon that enables correlations between remote observers that are stronger than those possible classically @xcite .",
    "the three - box experiment is one of the only quantum paradoxes which do not employ entanglement between remote locations , so it is a genuinely new paradox .",
    "the existence of a classical system which can perform the three - box task would remove the paradox , and thus it is important to analyze the validity of kirkpatrick s argument .    in the next section we consider some unusual properties of a pre- and post - selected spin-@xmath2 particle , in order to clarify the main paradoxical feature of the quantum three - box experiment described later in section 3 .",
    "section 4 is devoted to a presentation of kirkpatrick s game as given in his paper . in section 5",
    "we strip kirkpatrick s game of those elements which are not relevant to the analogy with the three - box paradox and describe other simple classical games with similar properties .",
    "this allows us to show that kirkpatrick s game does not present a classical analogue to the quantum three - box paradox .",
    "section 6 concludes the paper with a broader view on related issues .",
    "in quantum theory , unlike classical theory , an initial ( or final ) state alone does not provide all the information about a system during the time interval between two measurements . for pre- and post - selected quantum systems ,",
    "a complete description is given by a two - state vector @xcite that takes into account both initial and final states .",
    "this is the basis for all the examples in which we can make apparently contradictory statements about a quantum system at the time between its pre- and post - selection .",
    "for example , consider a spin-@xmath2 particle pre - selected in the state @xmath3 and post - selected in the state @xmath4 .",
    "an intermediate measurement of @xmath5 or of @xmath6 is in either case certain to yield @xmath7 .",
    "the _ _ _ _ spin _ _ _ _ of the particle is _ certain _ to be `` up '' in the @xmath8 direction if a projection measurement onto @xmath3 is performed , and _ certain _ to be `` up '' in the @xmath9 direction if a projection measurement onto @xmath10 is performed .",
    "a naive classical analogy of a spin `` up '' in the @xmath8 direction is a classical pointer , an arrow , pointing in the @xmath8 direction .",
    "an arrow pointing in the @xmath8 direction certainly does not point in the @xmath9 direction , so apparently we have obtained a paradox of the kind associated with pre- and post - selection . however , it is not so , since there is no classical task involved .",
    "spin measurement is genuinely quantum , and within the framework of quantum theory there is no paradox . for",
    ", when the spin is in the state @xmath3 , we can not claim that it is not pointing in the @xmath9 direction ; even without post - selection there is a 50% chance of finding it in the state @xmath10 .",
    "an example of a situation that is paradoxical within the framework of quantum theory is a pre- and post - selected spin-@xmath2 particle that is certain to be `` up '' in the @xmath8 direction , certain to be `` up '' in the @xmath11 direction , _ and _ certain to be `` up '' in the @xmath9 direction @xcite .",
    "here we discuss another paradoxical experiment ; it is based on the mathematical structure of the three - box paradox .",
    "would you be surprised by the following ? suppose that we give you a box , and arrange a _",
    "single _ pre- and post - selected particle so that :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ if the particle is searched for in a box with its spin `` up '' in the @xmath9 direction , it is to be found with certainty , while if the same particle is searched for in the same box with its spin `` down '' in the @xmath9 direction , it is also to be found with certainty . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    these two properties are contradictory not only in the naive classical analogue ( of an arrow pointing in two opposite directions ) but also in standard quantum theory .",
    "the usual `` eigenvalue - eigenstate '' link suggests that a particle which is to be found with certainty , if searched for , in a box with its spin `` up '' in the @xmath9 direction has the quantum state @xmath10 , and thus can not be found in the box with its spin `` down '' in the @xmath9 direction .",
    "it is possible for a pre- and post - selected system to yield definite outcomes for intermediate measurements that are not ensured by either the pre - selection or the post - selection alone .",
    "still , a situation in which contradictory outcomes are obtained with certainty , if measured , is surprising .",
    "let us show how this is achieved .",
    "the system consists of a spin-@xmath2 particle and two boxes , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the particle is pre - selected in the state@xmath12 and post - selected in the state @xmath13 where @xmath14 represents the particle in box @xmath0 with spin `` up '' in the @xmath9 direction .",
    "we give you box @xmath0 and offer you to either look for a particle with spin `` up '' or to look for a particle with spin `` down '' inside .",
    "to do this , you have to perform an ideal projection measurement . therefore , if you look for the particle with spin `` up '' and find it , the particle s quantum state after your measurement becomes @xmath14 , but if you do not find it , its state becomes @xmath15 .",
    "the latter is orthogonal to the post - selected state , however , so the post - selection can not succeed if the particle is not found . and because the pre- and post - selections are symmetric with respect to the states @xmath14 and @xmath16 , the particle is also to be found , if searched for , with its spin `` down '' in the same box .",
    "although this spin example is more counter - intuitive than the previous one , it too does not fall into the category of `` quantum paradoxes '' as defined above , since there is no classical task involved . in both examples",
    "we discuss the results of spin measurements which are inherently quantum .",
    "the measurements in the second example are particularly difficult . in the first example",
    ", a suitably oriented stern - gerlach apparatus can be used , but in the second example this is no longer appropriate - a stern - gerlach measurement in box @xmath0 would distinguish between all three states @xmath14 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , and therefore would not be a projection measurement .",
    "the original three - box experiment @xcite involves no spin , only a particle and three separate boxes .",
    "the particle is pre - selected in the state@xmath18 and post - selected in the state @xmath19 where the mutually orthogonal states @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 denote the particle being in box @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath23 , respectively .    in between pre- and post - selection ,",
    "an observation takes place either of box @xmath0 or of box @xmath1 .",
    "a successful observation of box @xmath0 corresponds to the particle being found in the box and is represented by the projection @xmath24 .",
    "an unsuccessful observation of box @xmath0 corresponds to the particle _ not _ being found and is represented by @xmath25 .",
    "similar definitions hold for an observation of box @xmath1 .",
    "as before , each of the two intermediate observations is certain to succeed . indeed ,",
    "not finding the particle in @xmath0 leads to the quantum state @xmath26 , and not finding it in @xmath1 leads to the state @xmath27 , both of which are orthogonal to the post - selected state @xmath28 .",
    "the three - box example can be presented as a classical task which can not be achieved using classical means but which can be achieved using quantum preparation and verification measurements .",
    "consider the following game .",
    "alice , equipped with quantum devices , prepares the particle in the system of three boxes and passes the first two boxes on to bob .",
    "bob , who is unaware of alice s quantum machinery , is told to look in one of the boxes , and that he wins if he does _ not _ find anything",
    ". however , alice gets to decide according to her post - selection measurement whether the game `` counts '' or not .",
    "now , bob has no _ a priori _ reason not to agree to play ; his chances of winning appear to be 1/2 .",
    "it is obviously so before alice performs the post - selection measurement , and since bob is careful not to leave any mark disclosing the results of his measurement , alice apparently can not gain anything from the post - selection .",
    "bob will find , however , that alice somehow manages to discard all runs of the game in which he does not find the particle , and so bob will always lose .",
    "kirkpatrick @xcite claims that `` ... the three - box example is neither quantal nor a paradox ... '' , and supposedly demonstrates this by means of its reproduction in an elaborate playing card game .",
    "kirkpatrick s classical system is constructed using ordinary playing cards .",
    "each playing card has two marks , a `` face '' ( e.g. jack , queen , king ) and a `` suit '' ( e.g. spades , diamonds , hearts ) , and these are treated as system variables : @xmath29 ( with values @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 ( with values @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) . the deck of cards is divided into two parts called @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and the system consists also of a memory @xmath39 .",
    "kirkpatrick defines the following procedures , in which a system variable is generically referred to as @xmath40 and its values as @xmath41 .",
    "[ [ preparation . ] ] preparation .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + +    the system is `` prepared '' in a particular `` state '' @xmath42 ( e.g. @xmath43 ) by ( 1 ) placing all the cards with @xmath42 ( i.e. all the queens ) in @xmath37 and the remainder of the deck in @xmath38 , and ( 2 ) setting the memory to the variable name @xmath44 ( e.g @xmath45 ) .",
    "[ [ observation . ] ] observation .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + +    the variable @xmath40 is `` observed '' in the following manner . if @xmath46 , ( 1 ) select a card at random from @xmath37 and ( 2 ) report the value @xmath47 of the variable @xmath40 of this card ( i.e. , its `` face '' or `` suit '' ) .",
    "if @xmath48 , then ( 1 ) select a card at random from @xmath38 , ( 2 ) report the value @xmath47 of the variable @xmath40 of this card , and ( 3 ) prepare the system in the state @xmath42 according to the procedure defined above .",
    "[ [ partial - observation . ] ] partial observation .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in order to reproduce the three - box experiment , it should be possible to perform a partial ( as opposed to complete ) observation , in which one observes only whether or not the variable @xmath40 has a particular value @xmath47 . in a partial measurement of @xmath40 one",
    "selects a card from the appropriate part of the deck ( as determined by the content of @xmath39 ) and reports the value @xmath47 if the card s value of @xmath40 is indeed @xmath47 , and @xmath49 if the card s value of @xmath40 is _ not _ @xmath47 . if @xmath48 , one prepares the system according to the outcome . to prepare the system in the state @xmath50 , place all the cards with @xmath50 in @xmath37 and all other cards ( i.e. , those with @xmath42 ) in @xmath38 .",
    "the variable @xmath39 is , as before , set to @xmath44 .",
    "+ the role of the variable @xmath39 is apparently to distinguish between `` repeated '' and `` new '' observations .",
    "a repeated measurement is certain to yield the same outcome as obtained previously , whereas a `` new '' measurement ( which by definition must be a measurement of the other variable ) causes the system s state to be reset .",
    "the need to define partial observations has to do with the three - box analogue . in the three - box experiment ,",
    "projection measurements are involved that measure only whether or not the particle is in a particular box .",
    "such measurements are considered to be `` partial '' , whereas a `` complete '' measurement would consist of , e.g. , looking in all three boxes .",
    "the three - box analogue is supposedly obtained by choosing the following six cards for the deck : a jack of spades ( @xmath51 ) , a jack of diamonds ( @xmath52 ) , a queen of spades ( @xmath53 ) , a queen of diamonds ( @xmath54 ) , and two kings of hearts ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "( the reason for two kings of hearts is to have each value of each variable appear the same number of times in the deck ) .",
    "the system is prepared in the state @xmath43 .",
    "one of two partial observations of the variable @xmath33 then takes place : either of whether or not @xmath56 ( corresponding to an observation of box @xmath0 ) or of whether or not @xmath57 ( corresponding to an observation of box @xmath1 ) .",
    "finally , a post - selection measurement of @xmath29 is performed resulting in the final state @xmath58 .",
    "the initial state @xmath43 ensures that all outcomes are possible in the following observation of @xmath33 ( since the @xmath51 , the @xmath52 , and the @xmath55 are in @xmath38 ) .",
    "it is the post - selected , final state that ensures that if the intervening observation was of whether @xmath56 , then the @xmath51 must have been selected , and if it was of whether @xmath57 , then the @xmath52 must have been selected .",
    "this is because in the final measurement of @xmath29 a @xmath59 must be selected from @xmath38 , and whereas in the states @xmath56 and @xmath57 the @xmath55 remain in @xmath38 , in the states @xmath60 and @xmath61 they are moved to @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , given the post - selection , the @xmath51 and the @xmath52 are each certain to be selected , and the system s intermediate state is certain to be @xmath56 and certain to be @xmath57 , depending on what is measured .",
    "this , claims kirkpatrick , is analogous to the particle in the three - box experiment being found with certainty either in box @xmath0 or in box @xmath1 .",
    "the large part of kirkpatrick s game is extraneous to the three - box analogy .",
    "it is intended to mimic quantum mechanical phenomena in a more general sense . in another work @xcite",
    ", kirkpatrick uses a modified version of the game presented here , claiming that it illustrates the ordinary nature of much of quantum probability , including incompatibility of observables , interference , etc .",
    "we are not pursuaded by his arguments , but the discussion of these issues goes beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we therefore consider kirkpatrick s game without the complications of defining ( and using the terminology of ) system states and variables .",
    "consider a smaller deck of cards consisting of a jack of spades ( @xmath51 ) , a jack of diamonds ( @xmath52 ) , and a king of hearts ( @xmath59 ) , still distributed between two groups @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "suppose that initially all three cards are in @xmath38 .",
    "a card is then selected at random from @xmath38 , and as before a `` partial observation '' is performed either of whether or not it is a spade ( i.e. , the @xmath51 ) , or of whether or not it is a diamond ( the @xmath52 ) . in either case , if the outcome is positive , the selected card is placed in @xmath37 while the others remain in @xmath38 .",
    "otherwise , the selected card is returned to @xmath38 while the other cards are moved to @xmath37 .",
    "finally , a card is again selected at random from @xmath38 , and our post - selection requirement is that this final card is the @xmath59 .",
    "this requirement ensures that the previously selected card must have been the @xmath51 if spade was searched for , and must have been the @xmath52 if diamond was searched for instead .",
    "leifer and spekkens @xcite have suggested yet a simpler game to demonstrate this classical phenomenon .",
    "their system consists of a ball and a box .",
    "the box can be split into two half - boxes , either length - wise or width - wise , by placing a double partition inside and separating the resulting halves .",
    "the two half - boxes can be reassembled into a single box by joining them together and removing the partition .",
    "the halves of one division are denoted `` front '' and `` back '' , and of the other , `` right '' and `` left '' .",
    "one measures whether the ball is in the front half of the box by partitioning the box into front and back halves and shaking the front half to hear whether the ball is inside . if the ball is found in this case , its left / right position is randomized , but if it is not found then its left / right position is undisturbed .",
    "similar definitions apply for measurements of whether the ball is in the back , on the right , or on the left .",
    "now suppose that this system is pre - selected so that the ball is in the front half , and post - selected so that the ball is in the back half , where the intervening measurement consists of looking for the ball either on the right or on the left .",
    "then , the ball is necessarily found in the intervening measurement , since otherwise there is no disturbance of the initial front state and no way for the ball to be transferred to the back half .",
    "thus , the ball is certain to be found on the right if that is where it is looked for , and certain to be found on the left if that is where it is looked for instead .",
    "what these games have in common is that they use classical measurement disturbance to effectively encode the outcome of the measurement into the system . in both cases ,",
    "parts of the system are moved around in such a way that the post - selection becomes impossible whenever the measurement is unsuccessful .",
    "obviously there is nothing paradoxical about such mechanisms , but neither are they equivalent to the three - box experiment . in the three - box experiment ,",
    "the intermediate observation consists of just that - observation .",
    "a classical system , on the other hand , is not disturbed by observation , therefore the measurement must involve additional actions .",
    "we can suggest another three - box experiment , or game , which utilizes this kind of classical measurement disturbance and is entirely non - paradoxical .",
    "suppose we put a classical ball in one of three boxes , and have another observer look inside either the first box or the second .",
    "so long as the box is only observed , there is no post - selection measurement we can perform that will ensure the ball has been found .",
    "therefore , let us have the observer place the ball in the third box whenever he does not find it in the observed box .",
    "this makes it is easy to ensure the ball is found by post - selecting that finally the ball is not in the third box .",
    "it is this three - box game , rather than the original one , to which kirkpatrick s game is analogous .    in all these games the `` observation '' includes leaving a mark that is later",
    "`` read '' in the post - selection process .",
    "the observation in the original three - box experiment , which consists of opening a box , does not leave such a mark in the framework of classical physics .",
    "note that , contrary to the supposedly analogous games , a successful post - selection in the three - box experiment is possible even with no intermediate measurement ( i.e. , if none of the boxes are opened ) .",
    "the quantum three - box experiment , beyond its paradoxality , is very effective in demonstrating concepts that are related specifically to pre- and post - selected quantum systems .",
    "while we agree ( see @xcite ) with kastner @xcite that in the three - box experiment there is no ontological property , or any kind of hidden variable , corresponding to the particle `` being in box @xmath0 '' , we believe that consistent and useful operational definitions can be obtained for the `` elements of reality '' @xcite and `` weak - measurement elements of reality '' @xcite associated with the particle `` being in box @xmath0 '' .",
    "the former corresponds to `` if observed in @xmath0 , is to be found there with certainty '' , and the latter to the _ weak value _ associated with a _ weak measurement",
    "_ @xcite of the particle in @xmath0 .    in the case",
    "that we observe the particle in @xmath0 weakly ( i.e. , with negligible disturbance ) , these concepts become particularly useful , for it is then possible to weakly observe the particle in @xmath1 as well , at the same time . as it turns out , the `` elements of reality '' and `` weak - measurement elements of reality '' are the same as if there were indeed two particles , one in @xmath0 and another in @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "as we have shown , kirkpatrick s system does not reproduce the three - box paradox because it contains no contradiction . in @xcite ,",
    "kastner claims that the original three - box experiment does not contain a contradiction either .",
    "her argument is that because only one of the boxes is actually observed , the properties of `` being in box @xmath0 '' and of `` being in box @xmath1 '' can not be attributed simultaneously to the same single particle .",
    "kastner argues that once the particle is found , one can not consider what would have happened had the other box been observed instead .",
    "this implies that when the particle is found it actually becomes `` in the box '' as a result of the observation , i.e. , the measurement disturbance .",
    "thus , although kastner does not dispute the quantum mechanical nature of the three - box experiment , kirkpatrick s game seems to provide a good demonstration of her argument .",
    "kastner and kirkpatrick apparently have the following idea in common : that if disturbance is understood to be inherent to measurement , then the difficulty with regard to the three - box experiment is removed .",
    "this view is shared by leifer and spekkens , who show @xcite that any attempt to create a classical analogue of the three - box paradox requires measurement disturbance .",
    "but it is precisely because the classical observation in the three - box experiment is _ non - disturbing _ that the experiment can not be explained by classical physics or accomplished using classical means .",
    "this is what causes the three - box experiment to be a `` quantum paradox '' .",
