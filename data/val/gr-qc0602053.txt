    "many high - energy astrophysical problems(snrs , @xmath0-ray bursts -grbs , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) hot spots , etc . ) involve relativistic flows , and thus understanding relativistic flows is important for interpreting the astrophysical phenomena correctly .",
    "for instance , intrinsic beam velocities typically larger than @xmath1 are required to explain the apparent superluminal motions observed in relativistic jets in microquasars in galaxies@xcite as well as in extragalactic radio sources associated with agn .",
    "the shocks created during these phenomena accelerate particles which emit the observed radiation . in particular , it is widely accepted that the recently discovered grbs afterglow results from an emission by relativistic shocks , created by the interaction between an initial ejecta and the interstellar medium .",
    "the recent observations of grb afterglow have lead to numerous attempts to model these phenomena .",
    "general relativistic effects must be considered when strong gravitational fields are encountered as , for example , in the case of coalescing neutron stars or near black holes .",
    "the significant gravitational wave signal produced by some of these phenomena can also only be understood in the framework of the theory of general relativity .",
    "another field of research , where special relativistic flows are encountered , is heavy - ion collision experiments performed with large particle accelerators .",
    "the heavy - ions are accelerated up to ultra - relativistic velocities to study various aspects of heavy - ion collision physics ( e.g. , multi - particle production , the occurrence of nuclear shock waves , collective flow phenomena , or dissipative processes ) to explore the equation of state for hot dense nuclear matter , and to find evidence for the existence of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "multi - wavelength observation of extragalactic jets performed in radio , optical and x - ray bands have extended dramatically our knowledge about the complex phenomenology of these objects . by means of these observations ,",
    "different kinds of objects that can house these jets have been characterized , at the moment we can classify distinctly these sources as radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "a deeper analysis of these and other related objects led us to the idea of agn .",
    "the images obtained from hubble space telescope revealed a new detail in gas flow and shock wave patterns involving astrophysical jets and colliding interstellar winds of particles .",
    "astrophysical jets are defined as highly collimated outflows in the form of high velocity mass flows .",
    "the outflows are observed in young stellar objects , proto - planetary nebula , compact objects , agn , and grbs@xcite @xcite .",
    "the jets include high mach number and interact with surrounding ambient gas@xcite .",
    "simulating the fluid flow and shock wave patterns and detailed temperature profiles by implementing theoretical models in a gas dynamics simulator will help in analyzing the processes at work in these astrophysical objects . in these investigations ,",
    "we apply the hrsc scheme with appropriate initial and boundary conditions to simulate relativistic astrophysical jets with high mach number from the compact objects .",
    "pioneered in this field ref.@xcite is the pioneer in this field .",
    "they were able to show that a flow of supersonic plasma remains stable and develops features that could be identified with the features in the observations of radio galaxies .",
    "a circular and canonical deceleration area called mach disk as the hot spot , which is a strongly collimated beam as the elongated structure of the jets , and a big zone of exhaust material as the lobes of radio galaxies@xcite . meanwhile ,",
    "more physics has been included in the calculations such as the parameters varying in the perpendicular to the jet flow direction , the jet radius magnetic field @xcite@xcite and the special relativistic effects@xcite@xcite .",
    "jets inside massive star , observed and called highly relativistic jets , have been studied numerically in both newtonian@xcite @xcite and relativistic@xcite @xcite simulations and it has been shown that the collapsed model is able to explain many of the observed characteristic of grbs .",
    "the collapsar is formed when the iron core of a rotating massive star collapses to black hole and an accretion disk .",
    "the explosive deaths of massive stars produce relativistic jets .",
    "these studies are also declared that the interaction of jet with the matter at the stellar surface and the stellar wind could carry the information for activities .",
    "the cocoon of the jet would also have different properties and the shocks within cocoon and jet could lead to @xmath2ray and @xmath3ray transients .    in this paper ,",
    "our goal is to simulate the ultrarelativistic jet problem using the already existing code which solves fully special relativistic hydrodynamics equations with hrsc scheme .",
    "a general technical description of the hydrodynamic equation is given by donmez@xcite as they will be used in our code development and the analytic description of different problems .",
    "the grh equations are written in the standard covariant form , consist of the local conservation laws of the stress - energy tensor @xmath4 and the matter current density @xmath5 :    @xmath6    greek indices run from 0 to 3 , latin indices from 1 to 3 , and units in which the speed of light @xmath7 are used .",
    "@xmath8 stands for the covariant derivative with respect to the 4-metric of the underlying spacetime , @xmath9 .",
    "defining the characteristic waves of the general relativistic hydrodynamical equations is not trivial with imperfect fluid stress - energy tensor .",
    "the viscosity and heat conduction effects are neglected .",
    "this defines the perfect fluid stress - energy tensor .",
    "this stress - energy tensor is used to derive the hydrodynamical equations . using perfect fluid stress - energy tensor",
    ", we can solve some problems which are solved by the newtonian hydrodynamics with viscosity , such as those involving angular momentum transport and shock waves on an accretion disk , etc .",
    "entropy for perfect fluid is conserved along the fluid lines .",
    "the stress energy tensor for a perfect fluid is given as    @xmath10    a perfect fluid is a fluid that moves through spacetime with a 4-velocity @xmath11 which may vary from event to event .",

    "the equation of state might have the functional form @xmath17 .",
    "the perfect gas equation of state ,    @xmath18    is such a functional form .",
    "the conservation laws in the form given in eq.([covariant derivative ] ) are not suitable for the use in advanced numerical schemes in @xmath19 . in order to carry out numerical hydrodynamic evolutions and to use hrsc methods , the hydrodynamic equations after the 2 + 1 split must be written as a hyperbolic system of first order flux conservative equations .",

    "riemann problems with large initial pressure jumps produce blast waves with dense shells of material propagating at relativistic speeds .",
    "the riemann shock tube is a useful test problem because it has an exact time - dependent solution , and tests the ability of the code to evolve both smooth and discontinuous flows . for appropriate initial conditions , both the speed of the leading shock front and the velocity of the shell material approach the speed of light producing very narrow structures .",
    "the accurate description of these thin , relativistic shells involving large density contrasts is a challenge for any numerical code .",
    "some particular blast wave problems have become standard numerical tests .",
    "one of the common test problem is called the special relativistic shock tube problem . testing the code with this problem",
    "is given our paper donmez@xcite .",
    "the collision of two strong blast waves in one - dimension was used by woodward et al.@xcite to compare the performance of several numerical methods in classical hydrodynamics . in the relativistic case , yang et",
    "al.@xcite considered the same problem to test the high - order extensions of the relativistic beam scheme , whereas marti et al.@xcite used it to evaluate the performance of their relativistic ppm code . in the last treatment ,",
    "the original boundary conditions were changed ( from reflecting to outflow ) to avoid the reflection and subsequent interaction of rarefaction waves allowing for a comparison with an analytical solution .",
    "the initial data corresponding to this test , consisting of three constant states with large pressure jumps at the discontinuities separates the states .    in this report",
    ", the initial data corresponds to collision of two strong blast waves in @xmath19 , consisting of three constant states with large pressure jumps at the discontinuities separating the states ( at @xmath88 and @xmath89 , where @xmath90 ) , as well as containing the properties of the blast waves created by the decay of the initial discontinuities which are located on the main diagonal of the square box and the data is extracted along the other diagonal axis .",
    "the initial data for this test is listed in table[initial data for two relativistic blast wave collision ] .",
    "the initial pressure discontinuities drive shocks into the middle part of the grid ; behind them , rarefaction form and propagate toward the outher boundaries where they are falling out from computational domain .",
    "when the two shock waves collied at @xmath91 , a very dense shell is created .",
    "the collision gives rise to a narrow region of very high density as seen in fig.[density diff time ] bounded by two shocks moving at speeds @xmath92 ( shock at the left ) and @xmath93 ( shock at the right ) .",
    "the velocity of shock wave during the time evolution is plotted in the right panel of fig.[pressurevelocity diff time ] .",
    "the presence of very narrow structures involving large density jumps requires very fine zoning and high resolution scheme to resolve the states properly .",
    "the high resolution shock capturing scheme we used here resolves the structure of the collision region satisfactorily well .",
    "fig.[density at different resolution ] shows that more resolutions are needed to resolve the preshock and postshock states reasonably well .",
    "the left panel at fig.[pressurevelocity diff time ] shows the behavior of pressure jump during the time evolution .",
    "the outflowing shock does not propagate along the grid and the contact discontinuity is not created on the numerical results .",
    "investigation of gas flow in close binary systems is important in considering the accretion disk around the compact objects .",
    "the interaction of the disk with the compact objects , through processes that are still poorly understood , produces jets with high energy to mass ratio . here",
    "we are primarily concerned with the propagation of these jets , not so much with how they are born .",
    "the propagating jets produce solar wind in the medium and this wind is highly supersonic .",
    "so obstacles in the flow , large variations in stream speeds , or fast ejecta produce shock waves , just as shock waves are produced by a supersonic jet . with a jet ,",
    "sound waves develop ahead of the jet nose because the matter is traveling faster than the waves can escape .",
    "a shock wave forms , due to pressure buildup , to keep the air flowing around the jet .",
    "jets are , by current theory , the best , perhaps , essential method of explaining how such large amounts of energy can be observed from objects at cosmological distances .",
    "however , there is much speculation as to the exact nature of these jets , the primary questions being : how do they arise and what is their structure . in this paper ,",
    "we focus on the question , what is the structure of grb jets ?    here , we numerically model the @xmath19 simulation of a relativistic jet propagating through an homogeneous atmosphere . the initial computational domain and values of beam for the flow velocity , mach number , rest - mass density and adiabatic index are given in fig.[inital setup ] .",
    "the fluid viscosity and thermal conductivity are neglected .",
    "the ambient medium is has a size of @xmath94 .",
    "the jet is injected at @xmath95 in the direction of positive @xmath96axis .",
    "we have constructed a slab jet , which is periodic in the @xmath3 direction .",
    "an ideal gas equation of state with adiabatic index @xmath97 is assumed to describe both the jet matter and the ambient gas . in our calculation , @xmath98 resolution in @xmath32 and @xmath99 resolution in @xmath100 are used for figs.[2d jet different time],[2d differnet gamma and velocity ] .",
    "it is well known that the propagation of a supersonic jet is governed by the interaction of jet matter with ambient medium , which produces a bow shock in the ambient medium .",
    "the evolution of the jet was simulated up to the time when the head of the jet is about to reach to the boundary , which is far away from the injection point .",
    "the time evolution of relativistic jet for rest - mass density in the plane @xmath101 is given in fig.[2d jet different time ] at different snapshots when the jet propagates through @xmath102 plane .",
    "the presence of emitting matter moving at different velocities and orientations could lead to local variations of apparent relativistic motion within the jet .",
    "the distribution of apparent motions during the time evolutions is inhomogeneous and fringed as seen in fig.[2d jet different time ] .",
    "the structure of jet contains cocoon and vortexes with a bow shock .",
    "the cocoon contains shocked jet material deflected backward at the head of the jet .",
    "since the jet is narrowly collimated , its beam is very thin .    the fig.[box120 jet density diff time ] shows the variations in one - dimensional cut of rest mass density in the jet propagation direction , @xmath100 , at final snapshot for two different jet velocities , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "while the one with smaller velocity is called as a mildly relativistic jet , the other one is called the ultra - relativistic jet .",
    "the ultra - relativistic one displays rich internal structure with oblique shocks effectively decelerating the flow in the beam from mach number equal to @xmath105 at the injection point down to a value of about @xmath106 around the head as seen in fig.[mach number ] .",
    "the one - dimensional cut of the rest - mass density as given in fig.[box120 jet density diff time ] shows that the jet density propagates and oscillates on the working surface and it produces time varying waves and shock waves which interact with ambient medium .",
    "the pressure is larger at the head of jet and it causes the jet to propagate through the ambient medium at a larger speeds in both direction .",
    "the graphs seen in fig.[velocity in y ] show the variation of the @xmath32 velocity of cocoon , propagating through computational domain , at a fixed @xmath107 along the @xmath96axis for four different times .",
    "the head of jet has the largest @xmath32 velocity which is represented with peaks as seen in fig.[velocity in y ] .",
    "figs.[2d jet different time ] , [ box120 jet density diff time ] and [ mach number ] also depict that there is a mach shock at the jet head , and material that has passed through the head is slowly forming a backflow along the jet , building up the a shear layer .",
    "we have also examined the propagation of two - dimensional relativistic jet in case of the different initial velocities and adiabatic values , @xmath108 .",
    "the rest mass density for different @xmath108 values are plotted in fig.[2d differnet gamma and velocity ] . in agreement with previous studies on astrophysical problem ,",
    "the relativistic jet is also more tightly packed with the smaller @xmath108 .",
    "the lower @xmath108 means cooler jet with larger mach number of the flow .",
    "the cooler jet presents also a complex structure of internal shocks generated by pressure mismatches between the beam and the overpressured cocoon and by perturbations of the beam boundary by vortices and bulk motions within the cocoon . the cocoon is mainly formed by large vortices in cold jets with @xmath109 while the strong beam collimation causes a large acceleration of the jet in cold jets with @xmath110 .",
    "the beam gas is less efficiently redirected into the cocoon , and thinner cocoon with smaller vortices form with @xmath110 as seen in fig.[2d differnet gamma and velocity ] .",
    "we have described the main futures of stable @xmath19 special relativistic hydrodynamical code and discussed test problems in ref.@xcite and here involving strong shocks in two - dimension .",
    "the test problem solved here is called the collision of relativistic blast wave .",
    "the promising results from the test problem give us encouragement to simulate ultrarelativistic gas flows .",
    "we have carried out simulations of fully relativistic astrophysical jet in @xmath19 . by detailed examination of a time series of ultrarelativistic flow",
    ", we have described the propagation of jet through the computational domain .",
    "the ultrarelativistic flow is thought to occur and to play a crucial role in the generation of grbs .",
