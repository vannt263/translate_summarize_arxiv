    "electron spins in semiconductor quantum dots are a leading candidate for the physical realization of qubits in a quantum computer @xcite .",
    "although any quantum algorithm can be implemented using single - qubit and two - qubit gates @xcite , many such algorithms realize substantial increases in efficiency by exploiting simultaneous interactions among three or more qubits @xcite . in order to employ such simultaneous interactions , it is essential to understand in detail the many - body dynamics of the system of coupled qubits .",
    "more generally , since a practical quantum computer may need to contain as many as @xmath0 qubits @xcite , it is essential to characterize the effect of many - body interactions on the system s overall energy landscape .    in past work @xcite",
    ", we used a model confining potential of superposed parabolic minima to demonstrate that three - body effects significantly influence the hamiltonian of three electrons confined to three quantum dots at the vertices of an equilateral triangle and that four - body effects are significant for four electrons confined to a tetrahedral arrangement of four dots . here",
    "we extend these results in two ways .",
    "first , we analyze three quantum dots in a linear geometry @xcite and four dots in a square geometry @xcite since these geometries are more likely to occur in a real quantum computer apparatus .",
    "second , by employing a gaussian shape for the confining potential of each well @xcite , we explore the sensitivity of the many - body effects to the form of the confining potential . in both cases",
    ", a non - perturbative calculation finds that many - body effects contribute appreciably to the hamiltonian .",
    "we note that scarola et al .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that the application of a magnetic field allows chiral terms to arise in the spin hamiltonian , which modifies this hamiltonian in another important manner as compared to the naive heisenberg form .",
    "to date , discussions of quantum dot quantum computation have nearly always assumed pairwise heisenberg interactions . in view of the above result",
    ", this implies that computational errors may occur in the context of quantum computers using electron spin qubits in quantum dots , unless one always simultaneously couples only disjoint pairs of dots .",
    "there are at least four circumstances where this may be undesirable or even infeasible .",
    "one is fault tolerant quantum error correction , where simultaneous operations on several coupled dots have been associated with better error thresholds .",
    "a second is adiabatic quantum computation @xcite , in which the final hamiltonian may include the simultaneous interactions that we discuss here .",
    "we will not analyze these possibilities here , although we believe that the methods we discuss below are relevant to them .",
    "we will focus on two other contexts , that of encoded universality  ( eu ) @xcite and that of computation on decoherence - free subspaces ( dfss ) @xcite and supercoherent qubits @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the goal is to perform universal quantum computation using ( eu : ) only the most easily controllable interaction , or ( dfs , supercoherence : ) using only interactions that preserve the code subspace , since that subspace offers protection against certain types of decoherence .",
    "( strong and fast exchange interaction pulses can further be used to suppress decoherence @xcite and to eliminate decoherence - induced leakage @xcite . )",
    "we will refer to these cases collectively as encoded quantum computation.it turns out that universal quantum computation using only the heisenberg exchange interaction is an extremely attractive possibility in encoded models , and we will consider it in detail below . after establishing that four - body interaction terms can arise in a heisenberg exchange hamiltonian , we investigate the question of neutralizing their effect by using encoded qubits @xcite . by generalizing the work of bacon @xcite , who showed that universal quantum computation was possible using encoded gates with two - body coupling hamiltonians ( i.e. , assuming that the heisenberg hamiltonian was applicable",
    "even when coupling three or more dots at a time ) , we enumerate tuning conditions on experimental parameters that are needed for the four - body effects to cancel out .",
    "an alternative is to design these encoded gates while allowing only pairs of electrons to couple at any given time .",
    "this is indeed possible , as shown in ref .",

    "first , by the same reasoning used to derive eqs .",
    "( [ hspinj_3 ] ) and ( [ hspinj_4 ] ) , we note that a four - dot hamiltonian for the geometry of @xmath259 contains a constant term and 9 independent coupling coefficients .",
    "if these 9 coefficients take on a given set of values and we wish to adjust them to meet constraints such as those listed above , we would need 9 additional degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "we make the conservative assumption , however , that one two - body coefficient and one four - body coefficient can be left unaltered and the others adjusted to correspond to them , which means that only 7 additional parameters are required . similarly , for the subset @xmath260 ( @xmath261 , @xmath262 , @xmath243 ) , there are 9 ( 6 , 7 , 5 ) independent coupling coefficients , for which we require 7 ( 4 , 5 , 3 ) tunable parameters if a given set of constraints are to be satisfied",
    "of course , we will count one more degree of freedom whenever a constraint includes relationships between the two - body and four - body energies .",
    "now suppose that we designate one basechoice of @xmath263 , such that within each of the two squares , all the quantities @xmath43 $ ] are equal , all the quantities @xmath264 $ ] are equal , and @xmath264=2k_{2}[ij]$ ] .",
    "that arrangement can simultaneously satisfy constraints ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) , ( e ) , ( f ) , ( h ) , ( i ) , ( j ) , ( l ) , ( m ) , ( n ) , and ( p ) , provided that the value of @xmath241 $ ] is chosen appropriately . from this potential",
    ", we would need to make one change within @xmath265 to reach condition ( a ) or condition ( g ) , or one change within @xmath266 to obtain ( k ) or ( o ) .",
    "the couplings of @xmath259 must be adjusted to match ( q ) while still satisfying ( n ) , ( o ) , and ( p ) , which requires 6 additional degrees of freedom as explained in the previous paragraph . similarly , ( v ) ( ( w ) , ( x ) ) and ( r ) ( ( s ) , ( t ) ) together imply particular adjustments to the four - body couplings in @xmath260 ( @xmath261 , @xmath262 ) , which requires 6 ( 3,4 ) new parameters .",
    "( the single - valued function in question is the same for all three cases , so @xmath256 $ ] ends up equalling @xmath258 $ ] and @xmath257 $ ] . ) finally , we need two more degrees of freedom available somewhere in order to meet constraint ( u ) , for a grand total of 28 degrees of freedom .    to put the size of this number into perspective , we will also count the independently tuned energies necessary to meet the conditions on eqc using pairwise couplings alone . by choosing a suitable combination of @xmath263 for an entire eight - spin system",
    ", we could satisfy ( b ) , ( c ) , ( f ) , ( j ) , and ( n ) at the same time ; one more degree of freedom would be necessary to also satisfy ( o ) . starting from such a system",
    ", we could presumably satisfy ( a ) or ( g ) by adjusting one parameter within @xmath265 , or satisfy ( k ) by adjusting one parameter within @xmath243 .",
    "hence we estimate that 7 degrees of freedom are required for the purely heisenberg hamiltonian used in ref .",
    "we see that , even if one presupposes the ability to create and position many identical qubits of the form ( [ eq:0l ] ) , ( [ eq:1l ] ) ( 3 free parameters ) , accounting correctly for two - body and four - body coupling is still a great deal more demanding than two - body coupling alone .",
    "it is this experimental challenge that must be weighed against the increased length ( and hence vulnerability to decoherence ) of pulse sequences employing only two - body couplings @xcite .",
    "earlier work @xcite showed that in highly symmetrical geometries , the interaction between three and four mutually interacting electrons confined in parabolic potentials contains many - body terms , which in the case of four electrons qualitatively modify the usual heisenberg interaction . in this work",
    "we have improved upon these early results by considering realistic , linear and square geometries , and by utilizing gaussian confining potentials .",
    "specifically , we have shown in a heitler - london calculation that in the case of four mutually interacting electrons , in both the linear and square geometries , the system s hamiltonian contains four - body exchange terms which may be of comparable strength to the heisenberg exchange interactions .",
    "this can have important implications for quantum information processing using coupled quantum dots .",
    "we have considered , in particular , the implications for the quantum computing using logical qubits encoded into decoherence - free subspaces of four electrons per qubit .",
    "we showed that previously designed conditional quantum logic gates between these encoded qubits must be modified , in order to account for the four - body terms that alter the ( previously assumed ) heisenberg interaction , when four or more electrons are coupled simultaneously .",
    "this requires the ability to tune , to a certain extent , the four - body exchange constants .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that there are alternatives to this method of implementing encoded conditional logic gates , which may be less demanding . in particular",
    ", it is worth exploring the possibility of completing the set of universal encoded quantum logic gates by supplementing single - qubit gates ( where , as we have shown , four - body effects are harmless ) with measurements and teleportation , as in linear optics quantum computing @xcite .",
