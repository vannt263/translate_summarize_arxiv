    "the eigenvalue spectra of a network provide valuable information regarding the behavior of many dynamical processes running within the network p08 .",
    "for example , the eigenvalue spectra of the laplacian and adjacency matrices of a graph affects the mixing speed of markov chains @xcite , the stability of synchronization of a network of nonlinear oscillators pc98,pv05 , the spreading of a virus in a network @xcite , as well as the dynamical behavior of many decentralized network algorithms l97 .",
    "similarly , the second smallest eigenvalue of the laplacian matrix ( also called spectral gap ) is broadly considered a critical parameter that influences the stability and robustness properties of dynamical systems that are implemented over information networks @xcite .",

    ", we propose a novel framework to control the structure of a network of mobile robots to achieve a desired eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "in particular , we focus on the spectrum of the weighted adjacency matrix of the network , with weights that are ( decreasing ) functions of the inter - robot distances .",
    "this construction is relevant , for example , in modeling the signal strength in wireless communication networks .",
    "although our framework performs well with different distance metrics , in this paper , we focus on the @xmath0 norm ( manhattan distance ) primarily for analytical reasons , since its composition with convex functions preserves their convexity . additionally , this metric has potential applications in indoor navigation where the presence of obstacles forces the signals to propagate in grid - like environments .",
    "we employ a novel abstraction of the eigenvalue spectrum in terms of the associated spectral moments , and define artificial potentials that capture the distance between the network s spectral moments and their desired values .",
    "these potentials are minimized via a gradient descent algorithm , for which we show convergence to the globally optimal moments . since the eigenvalue spectrum is uniquely determined by the associated spectral moments",
