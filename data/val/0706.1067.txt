    "stability is a crucial requirement for a model to produce realistic descriptions .",
    "thus , different stability analyzed of solar structures can be found in the literature , generally restricted to special types of perturbations and specific equilibrium models .",
    "these includes , models that consider adiabatic configuration such as the ones analyzed via the classical criterion of bernstein et al .",
    "@xcite or those that presuppose static equilibrium and analyze thermal stability . in the application of bernstein s criterion",
    ", the adiabatic assumption implies that the energy balance equation is not required and thus dissipation is impossible .",
    "also the assumption of static models is a strong , and often unjustified , restriction for open systems .",
    "thus , a crucial question for any theoretical model is whether the much more common far  from  equilibrium states are stable , where the consideration of both thermal and mechanical coupled equations must be included .",
    "a more realistic analysis of the stability of configurations represented by non - conservative equations was presented by lerche and low @xcite .",
    "they proposed a lagrangian principle in order to analyze quiescent prominences that can undergo thermal instabilities .",
    "however the non  self  adjoint character of the operators involved in the obtained principle makes the physical interpretation difficult .",
    "in this paper we apply an energy principle to analyze the stability of solar coronal loops .",
    "the principle was obtained in a previous paper ( paper i : costa et al .",
    "@xcite ; see also sicardi et al .",
    "@xcite , see also sicardi et al .",
    "@xcite ) using a general procedure of irreversible thermodynamics -based on firmly established thermodynamic laws- that can be understood as an extension of bernstein s mhd principle to situations far from thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "this fact has the advantage that many known results obtained by simpler criteria can be re  examined by a direct comparison with our criterion , and that , as it is obtained via a thermodynamic approach , allows a straightforward physical interpretation . the principle associates stability with the sign of a quadratic form avoiding non  self  adjoint operators .",
    "obtaining a self  adjoint operator is a requirement for our principle to hold . when this is accomplished the calculus is simplified .",
    "the self  adjoint character of an operator implies that the eigenvalues @xmath0 are real .",
    "hence stability transitions always occur when @xmath0 crosses zero , rather than at particular points of the real axis where the real part of the eigenvalue is different from zero , i.e. @xmath1 , leading to an efficient formulation to test stability .",
    "thus , the symmetry considerations of the self  adjoint operators , the fact that there is a diagonal form associated with these operators , and that the rayleigh  ritz theorem states the existence of a minimum eigenvalue , are important reasons to try to maintain self  adjointness in the consideration of stability .      the theoretical modeling and the interpretation of observations of coronal",
    "loop systems deal , among others , with the discussion whether the propagating observed disturbances in loops and post  flare loops are waves or plasma flow .    dynamical features of brightening coronal loops have been traditionally interpreted as field ",
    "aligned flow of matter generated by asymmetries in the energy input .",
    "most classical theoretical models have difficulties in determining the physical conditions that make them compatible with observations .",
    "both static loops and steady state models -for the two classes of temperatures models : hot ( isothermal coronas with t @xmath2 ) and cool ( gradually increasing temperatures up to t @xmath3 ) - fail to provide a satisfactory explanation for both the emission measure distribution and the doppler shift observations ( jordan @xcite ; serio @xcite ; craig and mcclymont @xcite ; mariska @xcite ) . thus , this suggests that in traditional model scenarios radiative losses can not be compensated by thermal conduction .",
    "therefore , other heating mechanisms must be assumed ( aschwanden et al .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; walsh and galtier @xcite ) . also , theoretical time  dependent models of individual loops where the plasma evolves in response to a cyclical process of heating and cooling of the flow have difficulties in fitting observations ( klimchuk and mariska @xcite ) .",
    "the assumption of propagating disturbances associated with slow magnetoacoustic waves in high alfvn speed media is also a field of investigation .",
    "several wave  based models were developed to explain observations ( nakariakov et al .",
    "@xcite ; tsiklauri and nakariakov @xcite ) .",
    "these authors suggest that -depending on the relative importance of dissipation by magnetic resistivity- upwardly propagating waves ( of observed periods between 5 - 20 min ) that decay significantly in the vicinity of the loop apex could explain the rarity of observational detection of downwardly propagating waves .",
    "however , upwardly propagating disturbances with non - decaying or even growing amplitudes were observed in coronal eit plumes .",
    "analytic models have shown that slow magnetoacoustic waves may be trapped and nonlinearly steepened with height , providing a possible interpretation of the phenomenon ( ofman et al @xcite ) .",
    "however , due to the intensity of the flaring , the plasma dynamic of flare loops is generally associated with flows rather than with waves .",
    "in fact , systematic intensity perturbations in post  flare loops can suggest that they are the result of evaporation  condensation cycles caused by the efficient heating of the flaring plasma from the chromosphere .",
    "thus , chromospheric evaporation seems to be the main initial matter inflow source for flare loops .",
    "de groof et al .",
    "@xcite analyzed an off  limb half loop structure from an eit shutterless campaign and gave arguments to reject the slow magnetoacoustic description and to support the flowing / falling plasma one .",
    "nevertheless , these authors admit that the wave theory can not be excluded yet .",
    "other authors have suggested that a combination of phenomena can be at the basis of a better interpretation .",
    "alexander et al .",
    "@xcite examined 10 flares and concluded that plasma turbulence could be the source of the observed intensity changes rather than hydrodynamic flows such as chromospheric evaporation .",
    "they pointed out that it can not be excluded that there is a degree of `` gentle evaporation '' occurring early in the event with associated hard x  ray emission below their threshold of detection .",
    "a series of more recent papers ( tsiklauri et al .",
    "@xcitea ; @xciteb ; @xcitec ) that combine theoretical and observational analysis showed that oscillations in white , radio and x  ray light curves observed during solar and stellar flares may be produced by slow standing magnetoacoustic modes of the loops .",
    "they found that a transient heat deposition at the loop bottom -or at the apex- leads to a posterior up  flow evaporation of material of the order of a few hundreds of @xmath4 . during the peak of the flare , the simulations showed that a combined action of heat input and conductive and radiate losses could yield an oscillatory pattern with typical amplitudes of up to a few tens of @xmath4 .",
    "then , a cooling phase of plasma draining with velocities of the order of hundreds of @xmath4 occurs . the numerical quasi ",
    "periodic oscillations in all the physical quantities , that resemble observational features , were interpreted as being produced by standing sound waves caused by impulsive and localized heating .    in previous papers ( borgazzi and costa @xcite ; costa and stenborg @xcite ) one of us developed a diagnostic observational method to describe loop intensity variations , both in space and time , along coarse  grain loop structures .",
    "we find that none of the arguments leading to the determination of whether waves or flow models can better fit observations was conclusive .",
    "some of our results suggested wave  based model interpretations i.e. the periodic behaviour of the disturbances observed , the almost constant speed of some brightening features and the fact that the estimated speeds were not higher that the sound speed in the coronal loops .",
    "however , as we mentioned , the period behaviour can also be attributed to flows ( gmez et al .",
    "@xcite ; de groof et al .",
    "@xcite ) . also , even when the calculated speeds were not greater than the sound ones , some of the velocity patterns were far from being constant and their values were comparable to the free - fall case .",
    "another open question is the relation between the loop s coronal dynamics and the physical conditions on the chromospheric bases .",
    "borgazzi and costa @xcite found a longitude of chromospheric coherence that characterizes the behaviour of a whole loop ",
    "system of evolving coronal  isolated filaments .",
    "this description is in accordance with limit ",
    "cycle models that require that the triggering mechanism of the dynamics is located at the bottom of the structure giving rise to the observed similar coronal conditions of the isolated filaments .",
    "another aspect that deserves attention is whether it is physically possible that the periodicity observed could be related to , or could be the consequence of propagating magnetoacoustic modes from the chromosphere that have suffered distortion due to the dispersing media .",
    "other point that is under debate is the thermal structure of the loops .",
    "loop observations with trace ( transition region and coronal explorer , handy et al .",
    "@xcite ) suggest that hot coronal loops are isothermal and more dense than the predictions of static loop models .",
    "however this scenario is not conclusive and other interpretations are possible .",
    "reale and peres @xcite showed that bundles of thin strands , each one behaving as a static loop , with its characteristic thermal structure , convoluted with the trace temperature response could appear as a single almost isothermal loop .",
    "a wide range of configurations can be proposed to fit observations .",
    "the fact that images form a compound of complex integrated time ",
    "varying data that are not easy to resolve is at the basis of this difficulty .",
    "the loops under analysis are surrounded by other structures that usually intersect them along the line of sight and the change of the brightening of the loops is also affected by background emission .",
    "thus , efforts are made to produce observational and theoretical results of coronal loop dynamics .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate whether the propagating observed disturbances in loops are waves or plasma flow and their thermal structure . non ",
    "isothermal loops are traditional candidates for hopf instabilities with cycles of flow evaporating and condensing , thus the analysis of frequencies and mode structures can provide insight into a possible wave model interpretation of these types of configurations .",
    "we consider the stability analysis as the leading criterion to select possible theoretical wave models .",
    "the fact that a number of non  linear equilibria are possible due to the open character of the systems makes it necessary to consider both thermal and mechanical stability in a coupled way .",
    "the thermodynamics of irreversible processes is described in terms of phenomenological relations between conjugate pairs of thermodynamic variables : the flows and the forces that cause them .",
    "the linear thermodynamic approximation treats small deviations from the equilibrium state by including fluctuations in the neighborhood of this state .",
    "it describes the behaviour of the system around the equilibrium state or around a non  equilibrium stationary one that is linearly close to it .",
    "if the system is isolated , as is stated by the second law of thermodynamics , the entropy grows exponentially up to its maximum value . that the system is in an open  near  equilibrium state means that energy and matter is exchanged with the neighbors and the entropy of the system is not necessarily positive .",
    "even when the entropy produced in the system s interior , due to irreversible processes , is never negative , a negative flow of entropy produced by the exchange of matter and energy can make the system remain indefinitely in a near  equilibrium state .",
    "these states are known as stationary states and a coherent dynamic of the system could last if sufficient negative entropy flow is provided to it .",
    "thus , the criterion that states the stability of this stationary state gives insight into the dynamic structures that can be found in nature .",
    "these stationary states are also known as detailed balanced .",
    "as onsager pointed out @xcite , the balance consists of the compensation between the fluctuations and dissipation produced by the flows and forces that have a microscopic reversible character near the thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the empirical relations between flows and forces are linear and related by the so  called resistance matrix @xmath5 that is symmetric and positive definite .",
    "its symmetric character is guaranteed by the principle of microscopic reversibility and its positive definiteness by the proximity of the reference state to the thermodynamic equilibrium , where the entropy has a maximum .",
    "however , there is no continuity between linear and nonlinear thermodynamical processes .",
    "when the system is beyond the immediate neighborhood of the stationary state the nonlinearities become visible .",
    "instabilities that cause dynamic transitions in open systems are responsible for the qualitative difference between linear and nonlinear thermodynamics",
    ". therefore , dynamic cooperative phenomena can only arise in nonlinear thermodynamics .",
    "thus , nonlinear thermodynamics is related to the stability properties of non  equilibrium stationary states , where the linear relation between flows and forces can become state dependent ( i.e. @xmath5 is not necessarily a symmetric positive definite matrix ) , and the problem of having a thermodynamic theory to provide a general criterion for the stability of the system -which is not evident through the integration of the variational equations- becomes a fundamental point .",
    "linear thermodynamics is the extension of the linear theory to situations far from thermodynamic equilibrium where the relaxation of the processes to a steady state of non - equilibrium ( nonlinear state ) is not assured and requires a stability analysis ( glansdorff and prigogine @xcite ; keizer @xcite ; graham @xcite ; lavenda @xcite ) .",
    "in paper i we showed how to obtain the variational principle from the equations that describe the dynamics of the system of interest .",
    "the method consists of obtaining a lyapunov function , also known as generalized potential , that represents the mathematical expression of the stability conditions .",
    "this function is determined by the analysis of the thermodynamic properties of the system linearized around a non  linear stationary state also called non  linear equilibrium state .",
    "the equations governing the dynamics are written as a system of two coupled equations : the balance energy equation and the equation of motion .",
    "thus , the perturbation analysis around a stationary state is performed considering a variable state vector of four independent components : the three space component displacement and the temperature variation .",
    "once the linearization is done , the lyapunov function can be immediately obtained by inspection of the resulting expression written in a compact matrix form .",
    "each of the matrices of the compact expression are linear operators ( that could include spatial derivatives ) and have a clear physical interpretation that is given by its role in the equation .",
    "the matrix that multiplies the second time derivative of the perturbation is associated with the inertia of the system , the one that multiplies the first time derivative of the perturbation is associated with dissipation and the one that multiplies the perturbation itself is associated with potential forces over the system .",
    "the principle is subject to physically reasonable requirements of hermiticity and antihermiticity over the matrices . for a more detailed presentation",
    "see paper i and the references presented there .",
    "the specific model we analyze is taken to be composed of a magnetohydrodynamic ideal plasma ( i.e. with infinite electrical conductivity @xmath6 ) .",
    "the fundamental ideal magnetohydrodynamic equations to be considered are as follows .",
    "the mass conservation equation ,    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the density of the plasma , @xmath9 is the plasma velocity , and @xmath10 the time .",
    "the perfect gas law or state equation ,    @xmath11    @xmath12 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath13 the pressure , @xmath14 the temperature and @xmath15 the proton mass . for a fully ionized @xmath16 plasma @xmath17 ; the solar coronal abundances ( @xmath18 ) correspond to a molecular weight @xmath19 ; @xmath20 is the number density of electron particles ( aschwanden @xcite .",
    "the induction equation ,    @xmath21    @xmath22 is the magnetic field vector .",
    "the magnetic diffusivity was discarded .",
    "the equation of motion for the problem is :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the gravity expression and @xmath25 the current density .",
    "the energy balance equation takes the form : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the ratio of specific heats and @xmath28 is the energy loss function :    @xmath29    @xmath30 is the heat flux due to particle conduction along the loop , @xmath31 is the net radiation flux . neither the dominant heating mechanism of coronal loops nor the spatial distribution function of the energy input is known .",
    "so , the heating function is the least known term in the energy balance equation .",
    "thus , the usual situation is to try reasonable arbitrary mathematical functions which must fit the constraint imposed by the equilibrium conditions .",
    "as our model considers inhomogeneous temperature gradients and isothermality is usually associated with footpoint heated loops more than with uniformly heated ones we discard the first case and tried the general expression @xmath32 .",
    "a time varying dependence of @xmath16 was not considered for simplicity .",
    "however , it could be a requirement for modeling special events such as micro  flares or while considering magnetic reconnection phenomena .",
    "[ 5 ] expresses the fact that the gain in particle energy ( internal plus kinetic ) is due to heating sources , heat flow and radiation losses ; ohmic dissipation @xmath33 and all other heating sources were considered as vanishing terms implying that the optically thin assumption holds . then @xmath34 ; the temperature variation ( @xmath35 )",
    "was taken from priest @xcite .",
    "also @xmath36 and , as conduction across the magnetic field has been discarded , for a total ionized plasma @xmath37 .",
    "finally equation  [ 5 ] can be written as    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is a constant value to be determined from the equilibrium conditions .",
    "the linearization procedure is performed by replacing @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the last equations , and assuming hydrostatic conditions for the equation of motion .",

    "@xmath63 represents the location of the perturbed variables when performing the matrix product .",

    "thus , the dissipative principle and the new frequencies are respectively : @xmath69 @xmath70 with the same normalization condition .",
    "we are interested in analyzing the stability of non  homogeneous loops .",
    "this is , loops with inhomogeneous distributions of plasma density and temperatures .",
    "this character of the system poses additional difficulties for the stability analysis because the inhomogeneous nature of the medium determines the structure of the disturbance which is no longer sinusoidal , making the traditional normal mode analysis useless for this treatment .",
    "moreover , there may exist a continuous spectrum of stable modes besides the discrete one . as a first order approximation we neglect the effect of gravitational stratification and thus confine the analysis to characteristic spatial scales lower than the pressure scale height in the solar corona . in order to analyze the stability and to obtain the frequencies and modes the physical quantities in eq .",

    "we can then analyze stability and obtain the mode structure and the associated frequencies for the general mode given by eq . [ 31 ] .",
    "in order to calculate modes and frequencies we followed the schematic procedure described in paper i and in galindo trejo @xcite .",
    "we used a symbolic manipulation program to integrate the equations . @xmath130 and",
    "the perturbations were expanded in a three dimensional  fourier basis that adjusts to border conditions .",
    "thus , a quadratic form for @xmath130 was obtained and was minimized with the ritz variational procedure .",
    "a matrix discrete eigenvalue problem subject to a normalization constraint was obtained .",
    "the procedure is equivalent to solving eq .  [",
    "18 ] of our modified principle .",
    "once the modes are obtained , the stability condition of eq .  [ 17 ] for the generalized potential energy : @xmath131 must be corroborated .",
    "the following values were used for the numerical calculation of the modes    @xmath132 @xmath133    coronal loop parameters : @xmath134 ( or @xmath135 ) , @xmath136 @xmath137 @xmath138 electron number density @xmath139 ; @xmath140 .",
    "our main concern was to know whether the magnetic configuration of equilibrium could be stable under linear perturbations . for non homogeneous configurations",
    "it is well known that the stable eigenvalues can have continuous spectra while the unstable ones have a discrete spectrum ( see freidberg @xcite or priest @xcite ) .",
    "if the resulting mode components have a characteristic wavelength of the order of the equilibrium structure , the non  homogeneous character of modes could determine , for the stable modes , a continuous spectrum .",
    "thus , in this case , the traditional normal mode analysis gives only a rough description because one of the consequence of the existence of the continuum is that an accumulation of discrete eigenvalues can take place at either boundary , generally at @xmath141 or @xmath142 , indicating the presence of a continuum stable spectrum .",
    "note that as the basis used is discrete , the spectrum is necessarily discrete .",
    "however , the additional evaluation of the generalized potential energy provides the correct unstable modes and gives an approximate value of the most probable stable period when the smaller @xmath0 is not located at the boundaries .",
    "we used different values for @xmath143 : @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 ( @xmath143 is the wavenumber associated with the perturbation component transverse to the plane that contains the magnetic configuration ) .",
    "we also calculated the frequencies and modes for two different values of the magnetic field : @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "table 1 and table 2 show the eigenvalues ( periods ) associated with the different modes for the cases @xmath147 and @xmath148 respectively , considering @xmath144 and obtained by solving eq .  [ 18 ] .",
    "we obtained 12 eigenfrequencies and 12 eigenmodes for each of the magnetic field values i.e. we used a three  component expansion and a four  component perturbation vector .",
    "we evaluated the mode behaviour for @xmath149 .",
    "for each mode corresponding to a complex eigenvalue , the perturbation @xmath150 was at least two orders of magnitude smaller that the parallel @xmath151 component and the normal @xmath152 components .",
    "for the modes with real eigenvalue , in only one case was @xmath150 comparable to the smaller of the two other spatial perturbations .",
    "thus , for numerical simplicity , we used @xmath144 and we discarded three zero eigenvalues associated with this choice of @xmath143 .",
    "we then analyzed only the 9 relevant modes .",
    "this means that a two  dimensional analysis of the dynamics of the problem is reasonably able to obtain the overall behaviour within the approximations we are considering .",
    "thus , we decided to investigate the unstable modes and to consider the most stable one as a reference value for stability .",
    "the most stable mode is the one that has a real @xmath153 value and minimizes @xmath130 ( it is the mode that gives the minimum positive value of the functional @xmath130 ) and the most unstable one is the mode that has a complex @xmath153 value with the minimum value of @xmath154 ( @xmath155 the instability time ) .    from the analysis of the table data we can conclude : 1 ) for each of the two investigated magnetic values we have three complex values of @xmath153 and six real ones ; 2 ) in the two magnetic field cases the eigenvalues of the first mode are the same ; 3 ) in all the other cases the eigenvalues with @xmath148 are almost an order of magnitude smaller than the corresponding values of @xmath147 ; 4 )",
    "the series of eigenvalues is such that it could be possible that the stable periods accumulate at @xmath156 , thus the definite stability characterization is subject to the evaluation of the generalized potential energy of the modes .",
    "we analyzed the structure of the modes with complex values of @xmath153 as they are possible candidates for instability ( freidberg @xcite ) .",
    "we noted that in the two first modes the component that is tangent to the magnetic field @xmath157 is greater than the component @xmath158 that is normal to it .",
    "this can be seen from figure  [ fig : dos ] and figure  [ fig : tres ] where @xmath151 and @xmath152 are shown for the cases : @xmath147 and @xmath148 respectively , also using @xmath144 . the third mode",
    "( see figure  [ fig : cuatro ] ) has comparable values of @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "the fact that for the first mode the two values of @xmath159 give the same time eigenvalue @xmath160 indicates independence from the magnetic structure .",
    "this is consistent with the relative values between the two components in the two @xmath159 cases : @xmath161 ( see figure  [ fig : dos ] ) .",
    "thus , these magnetoacoustic modes are more of the acoustic type @xmath161 than of the alfvn type , i.e. @xmath162 ( see figure  [ fig : cinco ] ) .",
    "also , the obtained period is included in a range ( @xmath163 ) where mhd slow acoustic modes are expected ( aschwanden @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : tres ] shows the second mode for @xmath147 and @xmath148 respectively . also for both cases the @xmath157 perturbation is greater than the normal perturbation @xmath158 by an order of magnitude .",

    "the dispersion relation is obtained matching the internal and external mhd solutions via the requirement of continuity of pressure and perpendicular velocity .",
    "as in our model , the observed kink - mode oscillations correspond to the long - wavelength regime . in coronal conditions the magnetic field is almost equal inside and outside of the loop and the kink oscillation speed is almost the alfvn one depending on the ratio of external and internal density values , i.e. , outside and inside the loop . on the contrary ,",

    "the comparison of our stable mode data @xmath186 in the @xmath147 case is in good agreement with the kink - mode observational results .",
    "the period range ( see table 1 ) , the magnetic strength ( @xmath147 ) and the wave speed ( alfvn speed ) fit the observations for similar loop densities and loop lengths . also , the stable modes @xmath187 with @xmath148 ( see table 2 ) have periods that are comparable with the expected range of fast sausage - mode periods ( @xmath188 ) and wave speeds of the order of the alfvn speed ( aschwanden @xcite ) . however -even when a more precise comparison requires a modeling that takes into account differences between external and internal conditions- it is worth investigating whether these type of modes could be associated with more intense magnetic fields in comparison to the associated kink - mode magnetic fields .",

    "a main result regarding stability is that the characteristic time @xmath189 in which the instability grows is large enough to guarantee a relative permanence of the structure before it fades away : @xmath190 ; where @xmath191 is the typical characteristic time in which loops seem stable ( see costa and stenborg @xcite ) .",

    "thus , even when further calculation is needed in order to adjust the characteristic times , it seems that wave  based models could be able to describe the scenario of non  isothermal coronal loops for sufficiently short times comparable with the characteristic time in which the instability grows and the structure fades away . a more speculative argument about the relation between wave  based models and flow  based ones is given in the conclusions .",

    "we investigated -via a thermodynamic energy principle- the stability of a coronal inhomogeneous loop model in a non  linear equilibrium state , i.e. a given thermal and magnetic equilibrium configuration .",
    "we also obtained the frequencies and their associated modes .",
    "the perturbation chosen was of the general type described by eq .",
    "[ 31 ] which allowed the study of a more complex mode structure with coupled thermal and mechanical displacements from the equilibrium state .",
    "we used a three  component fourier basis expansion on the independent coordinate @xmath83 to characterize the unstable modes .",
    "we obtained three complex eigenvalues and six real ones with their corresponding eigenvectors for each of the magnetic field values @xmath159 analyzed .",
    "the other three modes were discarded .",
    "the definite stability condition of the modes is given by integrating the generalized potential energy density of eq .",
    "[ 17 ] , allowing the interpretation of long  wavelength disturbances that are present in inhomogeneous media .    1 .",
    "we used different values of @xmath143 ( @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 ) to calculate the eigenvectors with complex eigenvalues and for all cases we obtained vanishing values of @xmath150 with respect to the other perturbed quantities . when we repeated the procedure to calculate the modes with real eigenvectors we obtained small but not vanishing values of @xmath150 in comparison with the other components .",
    "thus , two dimensional loop coronal models with a temperature gradient of two orders of magnitude between the bottom and top are a good approximation to study the whole three dimensional stability .",
    "2 .   we can classify the structure of the modes obtained as follows : a ) those for which @xmath197 and b ) those for which @xmath198 . in the first case the perturbation @xmath199 is almost parallel to the magnetic field and the eigenvalue is relatively independent of its intensity resembling the acoustic waves where @xmath200 is independent of the magnetic field ( see figure  [ fig : cinco ] ) .",
    "this basic longitudinal mode describes an oscillation between parallel plasma kinetic energy and plasma internal energy . in the second case",
    "@xmath199 has an important orthogonal component and the eigenvalue varies with the magnetic field @xmath201 resembling the dependence of the alfvn waves @xmath202 . when the wave is nearly transverse it describes an oscillation between perpendicular plasma kinetic energy and the combined magnetic compressional and line bending energies .",
    "thus , the first case can be thought of as slow magnetoacoustic waves and the second one as fast magnetoacoustic waves .",
    "the period of the slow magnetoacoustic mode is also in accordance with observational data . between the fast magnetoacoustic modes and in the long wavelength regime we distinguish two possible types , depending of the strength of the magnetic field . for the modes with @xmath203 and @xmath147 we found that the period range , the magnetic strength and the speed of the modes resemble a fast kink  mode",
    "also , through the consideration of period range values we suggest that modes with @xmath203 and @xmath148 could be thought of as sausage modes .",
    "however , to go further with the classification of mode type a modeling that takes into consideration differences between the inside and outside of the loop is required .",
    "also , the non  homogeneous character of the problem places serious limitations on conclusions in relation to stable modes .",
    "we found only one unstable mode with characteristic growing time : @xmath204 .",
    "the approximate and most stable mode is @xmath182 for @xmath147 and @xmath193 for @xmath148 .",
    "the fact that there is an unstable mode means that the equilibrium state is unstable and that wave  based models are not adequate to fit observations .",
    "however , as @xmath205 by an order of magnitude or two ( depending on the @xmath159 value ) the equilibrium appearance of the loop and the brightening effects of the most stable mode could be sustained by a characteristic time which is in accordance with observational data ( @xmath206 the characteristic time of the instability ) .",
    "4 .   a much more speculative argument , which needs further analysis and numerical calculation of the non  linear behaviour of the modes , is as follows : the non  linear growth of unstable modes influences the stable modes ( they are called slaves ) , the resulting behaviour is fundamentally governed by the most unstable modes .",
    "as we obtained a unique unstable mode , of the type of a slow magnetoacoustic wave , this indicates an overall unstable behaviour governed by the tangential @xmath151 component and the thermal one .",
    "the thermal component of the unstable mode is shown in figure  [ fig : ocho ] . as a characteristic wavelength of the components @xmath151 and",
    "@xmath62 is @xmath207 , it would be worth investigating whether this instability could be associated with a limit  cycle solution generally characterized as a flow  based model ( gmez et al .",
    "@xcite ; de groof et al .",
    "if this is the case , @xmath155 should be the growth of the instability , before it reaches its non  linear saturated value , in a new equilibrium state of an oscillatory type in the @xmath151 and @xmath62 components .",
    "thus , both types of models ( waves and flow ) converge in explaining the instability of a magnetic structure with long wavelength perturbations of the order of the magnetic structure .",
    "also , even when the modes were linearly unstable , the fact that the dominant varying components are @xmath62 and @xmath151 , with the last one parallel to the magnetic field could imply that the magnetic structure ( but not the equilibrium state ) lasts much longer than what is stated by @xmath155 .",
    "moreover , this is in accordance with the energetic description of the type of perturbation .",
    "slow , nearly longitudinal magnetoacoustic modes describe a basic oscillation between parallel plasma kinetic energy and plasma internal energy where the magnetic energy plays no relevant role .",
    "this could justify long lasting loop observations with dynamic plasma inside .",
    "figure  [ fig : nueve ] is a scheme of the unstable mode superimposed on the magnetic structure . in half of the period the perturbation is always positive and grows until it reaches @xmath208 , then decreases until it becomes zero at @xmath209 and @xmath196 .",
    "the perturbation gives the tangential velocity @xmath199 of the plasma particles at each point of the magnetic configuration .",
    "thus , in half of the period , as described in the figure , the plasma is emerges from the chromosphere i.e. , @xmath210 . in the other half",
    ", the perturbation is inverted with respect to the figure , it is always negative , i.e. @xmath211 , and the plasma particles fall into the chromosphere .",
    "a limit cycle is known to be a closed curve ( a cycle ) in the vector space formed by the perturbations .",
    "figure  [ fig : diez ] shows the resulting curve in the space of perturbations @xmath212 for the two magnetic fields studied .",
    "it seems that only for relatively large values of the magnetic field limit cycle are solutions possible .",
