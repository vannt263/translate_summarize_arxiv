    "macroscopic quantum tunneling refers to the situation when an object consisting of many degrees of freedom , coupled to a dissipative environment , escapes from a metastable well via underbarrier quantum tunneling @xcite . in condensed matter",
    "this phenomenon was first observed through measurements of tunneling of the macroscopic magnetic flux created by a superconducting current in a circuit interrupted by a josephson junction @xcite .",
    "another example is tunneling of magnetization in solids @xcite . in cases of the magnetic flux or the magnetic moment of a nanoparticle ,",
    "the tunneling object is described by one or two macroscopic coordinates that depend on time , like in a problem of a tunneling particle in quantum mechanics .",
    "the environment enters the problem through interaction of these macroscopic coordinates with microscopic excitations of the medium .",
    "equally interesting , but significantly more involved , is the problem of tunneling of a macroscopic field between two distinct configurations .",
    "examples are tunneling of vortex lines in type - ii superconductors @xcite and tunneling of domain walls in magnets @xcite .",
    "the essential difference between the last two examples is that tunneling of vortex lines is determined by their predominantly dissipative dynamics @xcite , while tunneling of the spin - field is affected by dissipation to a much lesser degree .",
    "theory that describes quantum tunneling of extended condensed - matter objects involves space - time instantons that are similar to the instantons studied in relativistic field models .",
    "examples that are available for experimental studies are limited .",
    "consequently , any new example of tunneling of an extended object must be of significant interest .",
    "recent measurements of low - temperature magnetic relaxation of lead @xcite have elucidated the possibility of macroscopic quantum tunneling in type - i superconductors .",
    "such superconductors ( with lead being a prototypical system ) , unlike type - ii superconductors , do not develop vortex lines when placed in the magnetic field .",
    "instead , they exhibit intermediate state in which the sample splits into normal and superconducting regions separated by planar interfaces of positive energy @xcite . equilibrium states and dynamics of interfaces",
    "have been well studied by now @xcite .",
    "in all these studies the interface was treated as a classical object .",
    "recently , however , it was noticed @xcite that slow temporal evolution of magnetization in a superconducting pb sample was independent of temperature below a few kelvin .",
    "this observation pointed towards possibility of quantum tunneling of interfaces in the potential landscape determined by pinning .",
    "in general the pinning potential would be due to random distribution of pinning centers or due to properties of the sample surface . in a polycrystalline sample",
    "it may also be due to extended pinning of interfaces by grain boundaries .",
    "modern atomic deposition techniques permit preparation of a pinning layer with controlled properties .",
    "this inspired us to study a well defined problem in which the interface separating normal and superconducting regions is pinned by a planar defect .",
    "the corresponding pinning barrier can be controlled by a superconducting current that exerts a force on the interface . at low temperature",
    "the depinning of the interface would occur through quantum nucleation of a critical bump shown in fig.[interface ] .",
    "somewhat similar problems in 1 + 1 dimensions have been studied for a flux line pinned by the interlayer atomic potential in a layered superconductor @xcite and for a flux line pinned by a columnar defect @xcite .",
    "however , the two - dimensional nature of the interface , as compared to a one - dimensional flux line , makes the interface problem more challenging .",
    "note that tunneling of two - dimensional objects has been studied theoretically in application to non - thermal dynamics of planar domain walls @xcite and quantum nucleation of magnetic bubbles @xcite .",
    "these studies employed non - dissipative dynamics of the magnetization field because corrections coming from dissipation are not dominant for spin systems . on the contrary , the euclidean dynamics of the interface in a type - i superconductor is entirely dissipative , described by integro - differential equations in 2 + 1 dimensions . as far as we know this problem has not been studied before .",

    "same as for the flux lines , we neglect the inertial mass of the interface .",
    "its dynamics in a type - i superconductor is dominated by friction .",
    "we consider pinning of the interface by a planar defect located in the @xmath11 plane and choose the pinning potential in the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is roughly the width of the well that traps the interface and @xmath14 is a dimensionless constant describing the strength of the pinning .",

    "superconducting current parallel to the planar defect ( and to the interface pinned by the defect ) exerts a lorentz force on the interface similar to the force acting on a vortex line in a type - ii superconductor .",

    "the driving force experienced by the @xmath20 element of the interface in the @xmath21 direction is given by @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the magnetic field inside the interface with @xmath24 .",
