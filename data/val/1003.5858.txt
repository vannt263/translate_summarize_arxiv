    "recent experimental progress in controlled excitation of rydberg atoms from cold gases @xcite and in the production of ultracold polar molecules @xcite has opened new opportunities for the study of systems with dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "key features of these systems include the ability to control these interactions by varying the external fields , as well as the strong dependence of the interaction strength on the internal state of the atoms or molecule .",
    "an important example of this dependence is the rydberg blockade mechanism @xcite in which an atom in an excited rydberg state can prevent nearby atoms from being excited to rydberg states , because the strong interaction between the two excited atoms makes subsequent excitations non - resonant .",
    "this mechanism has been recently demonstrated in experiments @xcite , and has important potential applications to the production of fast quantum gates with two or several neutral atoms @xcite .",
    "moreover , the blockade produces rich and intriguing collective dynamics when atoms in a dense gas are excited to rydberg states @xcite .",
    "this cooperative behaviour is manifest in a suppression of the proportion of excited atoms with increasing density ( due to the presence of more atoms within the blockade radius ) , and also in an enhanced laser coupling to collective rydberg excitations .    in the context of rydberg atoms ,",
    "there has been a lot of interest in the possible production of crystalline states , where a small fraction of atoms in excited rydberg states arrange themselves in a regular array @xcite . in particular , when ground and excited states are coupled by a laser field , the resulting effective models correspond to crystalline states in the limit of weak coupling , with the fraction of excited atoms determined by a competition between the interaction energy and the detuning of the laser field from the atomic transition .    motivated by this experimental and theoretical progress , we consider here a collection of either polar molecules or neutral atoms loaded into a deep optical lattice , e.g. , with one particle per site .",
    "we assume that tunnelling in the lattice is negligible on the timescale of the experiment .",
    "using dressed rotational states for the polar molecules or rydberg states for the atoms we show how a microscopic model can be realized where two internal states of the particles are accessed , one of which exhibits a large dipole - dipole interaction , whilst the other is weakly interacting .",
    "we show that this system allows the realisation of crystalline formations in the internal states , with a periodicity related to the lattice period by a rational fraction .",
    "the regularity of the system makes it possible to realize crystals with high filling factors of strongly interacting states .",
    "in addition , the use of polar molecules makes it possible for the crystalline states to be long - lived , aiding in the measurement of characteristic correlation functions .",
    "we show that in a 1d tube , increasing the coupling strength between the internal states at a fixed detuning will break the crystalline order .",
    "this is characterized in 1d by a change in the density - density correlation ( ddc ) functions , which decay to a constant in the crystalline regime , but show different regions of exponential and algebraic decay for larger coupling strengths .",
    "we study in detail the dynamical preparation of states with crystalline order of different periodicities in the internal states by an appropriate time - variation of microwave or laser couplings . as was shown in previous studies for rydberg atoms in an optical lattice modelled by nearest - neighbour interactions",
    "@xcite , it is not possible to produce crystalline states simply by switching on the coupling field . instead ,",
    "this is made possible using an adiabatic variation of the parameters in the effective model .",
    "using an extended version of the time - evolving block decimation ( tebd ) algorithm @xcite , we calculate the coherent time - dependent many - body dynamics of the excitations .",
    "we show that for system sizes and parameters corresponding to realistic experimental configurations with either polar molecules or rydberg atoms we obtain fidelities @xmath0 compared with the ideal target states , i.e. , the ground states of the effective model .",
    "whilst the fidelity could be reduced by incoherent processes , e.g. decay of excited states , we estimate that these rates are small , and that the basic structure of the crystalline state will be robust .",
    "note that the time - dependent preparation of crystalline phases here follows the same philosophy as that for production of rydberg crystals in reference  @xcite .",
    "in focussing on the case of atoms or molecules initially trapped in a lattice , we concentrate here on the case with a high proportion of particles in the strongly interacting case .",
    "this is in contrast to reference  @xcite , which treats the case of a dilute gas of rydberg excitations that is more relevant for a frozen rydberg gas not trapped in a lattice .",
    "our study of the correlation functions in the crystalline and non - crystalline phases is , however , also relevant for the case of @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : real - long - range ] , we introduce the effective long - range spin - model that describes both the rydberg atoms and polar molecules in appropriate parameter regimes .",
    "then we briefly discuss in section  [ sec : numerical - method ] extensions to the tebd algorithm that we use to study the model . in section",
    "[ sec : ground - states - system ] , we analyse the ground states of this effective model and identify a target state of our time - dependent excitation process . the ground states are characterized as belonging to different quantum phases via the characteristic behaviour of ddc functions . in section  [ sec : dynam - cryst - state ] , we discuss a scheme to prepare crystalline states with high fidelity by an appropriate time - dependence of the external coupling field parameters . in section  [ sec : phys - impl - long ] , details of two different physical realizations of the effective model , with polar molecules ( section  [ sec : polar - molecules - an ] ) and rydberg atoms ( section  [ sec : rydb - excit - an ] ) are provided . finally , section  [ txt : outlook ] , provides the conclusion and outlook .",
    "we consider particles loaded into an optical lattice in a regime where the lattice is sufficiently deep that tunnelling can be neglected on the timescale of the experiment .",
    "we assume that the particles have two internal states , one of which exhibits a strong dipole - dipole interaction , whilst the other is weakly interacting .",
    "this can be realized for realistic experimental parameters either with    1 .   _",
    "polar molecules _ in an external electric field , where a microwave coupling of rotational states can give rize to dressed states with different dipole - dipole interactions , or 2 .   _ neutral atoms _ in an external electric field coupled via a laser to excited rydberg states , which in contrast to the ground states exhibit a strong dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "below we summarize the key points of each of these implementations .",
    "further details for polar molecules and neutral atoms coupled to excited rydberg states are given in section  [ sec : polar - molecules - an ] and section  [ sec : rydb - excit - an ] respectively .",
    "polar molecules in their electronic - vibrational ground - state manifold possess a number of features that make them appealing to design and implement specific spin - models .",
    "in addition to their electric structure , allowing e.g. for optical trapping , they have a rich internal ( rotational ) symmetry , with level spacings in the ghz regime , and negligible decoherence .",
    "they possess a permanent dipole - moment @xmath1 ( typically on the order of a few debye @xcite ) along the internuclear axis , which makes it possible to strongly couple their rotational excitations via static and microwave fields and gives rise to dipole - dipole interactions between different molecules .    .",
    "the molecules are aligned by a static electric field in @xmath2-direction , @xmath3 , and exposed to two time - dependent microwave fields @xmath4 , both linearly polarized along the @xmath5-axis . ,",
    "scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we consider a 1d optical lattice ( lattice spacing @xmath6 ) along the @xmath7 axis with one polar molecule trapped at each lattice site in the lowest vibrational state @xmath8 ( see figure  [ fig : pmsetup_1 ] ) , which can be realized either by loading an insulator state of polar molecules , or beginning deep in a mott insulator state with two atoms per site and associating them to form polar molecules @xcite . without external fields , the rotational states of the molecules do not possess a net dipole moment .",
    "however , finite dipole moments along the @xmath5-axis in the rotational states can be induced by applying a static external electric field @xmath3 in that direction .",
    "the key idea of our implementation is that a suitable choice of @xmath9 makes it possible to cancel the induced dipole moment in one of the dressed states , and we denote the complete state of an atom in this dressed state at site @xmath10 as @xmath11 .",
    "the single molecule ground state , which obtains a strong dipole moment from the static electric field , is denoted as @xmath12 . in the case that @xmath3 and @xmath9 are properly tuned , two molecules at distinct sites @xmath10 and @xmath13 that are in the states @xmath12 and @xmath14 lead to an energy shift due to the dipole - dipole interaction potential of @xmath15 . in section",
    "[ sec : polar - molecules - an ] we give example experimental parameters showing that an energy shift @xmath16 can be achieved .",
    "note that we can therefore assume that the molecules remain in their motional ground state , since the band separation ( trapping frequency ) @xmath17 is typically of the order of many tens of khz up to @xmath18 khz in a realistic scenario .",
    "finally , the states @xmath12 and @xmath11 on all sites @xmath10 are coupled by a weak microwave field @xmath19 with rabi frequency @xmath20 and detuning @xmath21 , which gives rise to the effective microscopic many - body model that is described in section  [ sec : effmod ] below .",
    "neutral atoms in an external electric field exhibit strong dipole - dipole interactions when in certain rydberg states with relatively large principal quantum number . for alkali atoms in states with principle quantum number @xmath22 , it is possible to obtain a dipole moment of more than one kilodebye ( see section  [ sec : rydb - excit - an ] for details ) . by finding isolated rydberg states ,",
    "the internal dynamics of each atom can be reduced to a two level system , where weakly interacting atoms in the ground state are coupled via a laser to these states with large dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "we assume that either atoms are loaded into a deep optical lattice with tight radial confinement , so that we have one atom per site along a 1d tube , or that we have weak radial confinement and many atoms per site ( as occurs , e.g. , when an optical lattice is applied along only one direction ) . in each case",
    ", we can assume that the ground - state atoms are confined to a single modefunction at each given lattice site , @xmath8 .",
    "in the case of a single atom per site , this is the wannier function for the lowest bloch band , which is analogous to the case of the polar molecules described above .",
    "for many atoms per site , interactions can populate higher bands , and @xmath8 will depend on the interactions . however , we assume that the timescale for excitation to the rydberg state is much shorter than timescales corresponding to the atomic motion , and that therefore we can neglect population of any modefunction other than the initial modefunction @xmath8 for either the ground or rydberg states .",
    "we then assume that we can have at most one excitation per lattice site , which in the case of large single - site populations is made possible by the rydberg blockade mechanism , when we ensure that the blockade radius is larger than the occupied region at any single lattice site ( see section  [ sec : rydb - excit - an ] ) .",
    "this makes it possible to describe the system with an effective spin-1/2 model , assigning a state on each lattice site to the existence or non - existence of an atom in an excited rydberg state on that site , labelled for site @xmath10 by the states @xmath12 and @xmath11 , respectively .    in comparison with polar molecules ,",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction of the strongly interacting state for rydberg atoms is much larger .",
    "if we choose a principal quantum number @xmath23 , then @xmath24 ( assuming a lattice spacing of @xmath25 , see section  [ sec : rydb - excit - an ] for more details ) .",
    "this corresponds to much faster experimental timescales .",
    "however , the polar molecules are much longer lived than atoms in excited rydberg states , and open up different opportunities for experimental observation of the crystalline states we discuss here .      in either the polar molecule or neutral atom case",
    "we can derive the same effective microscopic model for the system in a frame rotating with the frequency of the field coupling the two internal states .",
    "we assume that at most one particle per site can be in the strongly interacting state , and represent the two possible states ( weakly and strongly interacting ) at each lattice site as two spin states .",
    "we label these states for site @xmath10 as @xmath26 , where @xmath12 is the state exhibiting strong dipole - dipole interactions , and @xmath11 the non - interacting state .",
    "the hamiltonian can then be formulated as ( @xmath27 ) @xmath28 with @xmath29 being the local `` number operator '' for the interacting state at site @xmath10 .",
    "the pauli matrices are defined via @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where the latter is related to the number operators via @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath20 denotes the effective rabi frequency and @xmath21 the detuning of the laser , which excites the particles .",
    "@xmath33 is the dipole - dipole interaction energy shift between neighbouring sites .",
    "note that we assume the particles to remain in the motional states @xmath8 , and also neglect corrections to the @xmath34 decay due to the finite width of @xmath8 ( see section  [ sec : phys - impl - long ] for more details ) .    below we will first study the ground state properties of this model , which will give us target states for the dynamical preparation process .",
    "we will then study the time dependence of this system starting from a many - body state where all of the particles are weakly interacting ( @xmath35 ) , and investigate the adiabatic preparation of crystalline states as the parameters are varied .",
    "it is interesting to note that for an infinite system , the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath36 where we have removed constant terms , and @xmath37 denotes apry s constant @xcite .",
    "note that in the case of @xmath38 , the system is equivalent to an ising model in a transverse field with dipolar interactions .",
    "ground states of this model have been also studied in @xcite .",
    "to calculate the many - body dynamics and ground states of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , we make use of the tebd algorithm as introduced in @xcite .",
    "this algorithm makes possible the near - exact integration of the schrdinger equation for 1d lattice and spin hamiltonians based on a matrix product state ansatz , and has been applied to a range of such hamiltonians with next - neighbour interactions .",
    "there are also applications of matrix product state algorithms to dissipative systems @xcite , and these methods have been incorporated within density matrix renormalization group algorithms @xcite .",
    "there is also a strong effort to extend these ideas to higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "the modification in our work is the extension of these methods to the treatments of finite - range interactions . for the purposes of this study ,",
    "we include long - range interactions up to an arbitrary distance of @xmath13 sites , by implementing a routine for swapping site indices in the matrix product state representation .",
    "this adds a computational cost of @xmath39 basic operations compared to the standard tebd calculation .",
    "here we work with finite systems of size @xmath40 , and always properly represent interactions over the full length of the system , i.e. @xmath41 .",
    "this method of swapping also allows us to consider periodic boundary conditions for the dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "note that we always perform convergence tests in the matrix product state bond - dimension @xmath42 and other numerical parameters @xcite . for larger system sizes ,",
    "swapping sites can become inefficient , in part due to the higher required values of @xmath42 . to implement interaction terms over substantially larger distances than in this study ,",
    "more efficient algorithms should be used , e.g. , algorithms involving use of matrix product operators @xcite .",
    "we begin by studying the key ground state properties of the effective model of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) . this will allow to us to determine in which parameter regimes crystalline order will appear , and to characterize the states that will be the target states of the dynamical preparation process discussed next in section  [ sec : dynam - cryst - state ] .    ) .",
    "for @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the ground state involves all of the atoms in the weakly interacting state in order to minimize the interaction energy ( marked by the blue lobe ) .",
    "as the detuning @xmath45 is increased , it becomes favourable to add excitations to the system , but this competes with an increasing interaction energy .",
    "this competition gives rise to crystalline phases with periodicities determined by this competition ( marked by the brown lobes ) .",
    "for large @xmath46 , the crystalline order is broken , but some particles exist in excited states ( white area).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the hamiltonian we study here has strong similarities to another model treated in several recent studies , in which the dipole - dipole interactions were replaced with van der waals interactions arising for certain rydberg systems @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that for @xmath47 that system reduces to a classical spin model exhibiting a second order phase transition from a paramagnetic to a crystalline phase at @xmath48 , and we observe similar behaviour here . due to the dipolar long range character we expect crystalline states with different periodicities of the excitations to the strongly interacting state to appear for @xmath45 and small values of @xmath20 .",
    "the detuning plays the role of a chemical potential for strongly interacting states ( or external magnetic field in the spin model ) , and it becomes favourable to excite states with a dipole - dipole interaction on the lattice .",
    "however , the long - range interactions will compete energetically with the detuning , leading to crystal periodicities that decrease with increasing @xmath49 . below",
    "we show that as the coupling @xmath50 is increased , the crystalline order is broken , in favour of a paramagnetic phase in the spin language , with no long range density - density ordering .",
    "these key features of the phase diagram are sketched in figure  [ fig : phase_diag_sketch ] .",
    "we compute the ground state of equation  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) using the tebd algorithm in several different parameter regimes . as a first step",
    ", we look at the total number of particles in a strongly interacting state @xmath51 , @xmath52 in figure  [ fig : phase_diag ] we present a plot of @xmath53 for several detunings @xmath21 and effective rabi frequencies @xmath20 .",
    "we plot @xmath53 on a grid with spacings @xmath54 and @xmath55 .    , for ground states of the effective model in a @xmath56-site system .",
    "the hamiltonian is given through equation  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) and open boundary conditions are assumed .",
    "results are shown for several values of detuning @xmath21 and rabi frequency @xmath20 , and plateaus of zero , half , and full filling of the lattice are clearly visible for @xmath57 ( see text ) .",
    "the contours of @xmath58 and @xmath59 are drawn as lines on the @xmath21-@xmath20 plane.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    as expected , for small @xmath46 there is essentially no occupation of the strongly interacting states in regions with negative detuning , because a state with no @xmath12 excitations is energetically favoured .",
    "in contrast , a positive detuning leads to a reduction of the total energy when occupations of strongly interacting states are added to the system , and in regions with large positive detuning we find states with occupations of @xmath12 on all lattice sites . in the region between we observe varying excitation numbers depending on the choice of parameters . in particular , there is a large plateau in the region @xmath60 and @xmath57 , in which @xmath53 remains close to @xmath61 . in the plot the contours of fillings slightly smaller ( @xmath58 ) and larger ( @xmath59 ) than @xmath62 are drawn as lines on the @xmath21-@xmath20 plane .",
    "note that the @xmath62 plateau lobe is centred around a value slightly larger than @xmath63 , which is approximately the point where the second term in equation  ( [ eq : spinhamiltonian ] ) vanishes and our system becomes an effective ising spin model .",
    "the half filling plateau disappears with increasing @xmath20 and we find a linear interpolation between regions with zero and full filling in this regime .",
    "this is consistent with a breakdown of the crystalline structure , and we note that in the limit @xmath64 for finite @xmath21 we expect the filling to be constant at @xmath62 since the state @xmath65 becomes the ground state of the system .    note that the grid is too coarse - grained to resolve plateaus of smaller fractions of the filling .",
    "however , we observe several kinks in the particle number at small values of @xmath46 .",
    "we show below , e.g. , that the feature at @xmath66 corresponds to a crystalline state with filling @xmath67 .",
    "this will verify the lobe - like structure as depicted in figure  [ fig : phase_diag_sketch ] , however we find that the plateau for filling @xmath67 is significantly smaller , at values of @xmath68 . for values of @xmath69",
    "we also observe some kinks , which correspond to regular patterns in the lattice with two subsequent sites being in the strongly interacting state , followed by one site being in the state @xmath11",

    "note that the quantity @xmath73 is related to the mandel q - factor @xmath82 , which has been measured in recent experiments for the number of rydberg excitations in small ensembles of cold atoms @xcite and quantifies the deviation from a poissonian number statistic @xcite .    to study ground states in more detail for different parameter regimes , and",

    "however , the decay behaviour of the correlation functions for large @xmath10 should be independent of the site index @xmath85 in a sufficiently large system . to distinguish ground state phases by their decay behaviour",
    ", we will first calculate ground states of a system with periodic boundary conditions , in which the ddc becomes site independent .",
    "we then drop the site index and write @xmath86 .     for the ground states of hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) for @xmath70 and ( a ) @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and ( b ) @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",

    "the long - range crystalline order is indicated by the decay of @xmath101 to a non - zero value as a function of the site index @xmath10 .",
    "we find that for increasing @xmath40 the value of the constant to which @xmath101 decays becomes independent of the system size .",
    "we note , already from the comparison in figure  [ fig : ddc2ndtransition](a ) that as @xmath46 increases the strength of the long range crystalline order decreases . if we continue to increase @xmath46",
    ", we find that this order is broken entirely , as shown in figure  [ fig : ddc2ndtransition](b ) , with the same parameters , but for rabi frequencies @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "in these cases we also observe peaks with periodicity 2 , however , these occur only for very small values of @xmath104 . as @xmath10 increases , @xmath100 decays to zero , indicating the breakdown of the long - range order .",
    "this appears as a phase transition from crystalline order to essentially a `` paramagnetic phase '' , in which the correlations typically decay exponentially . here",
    "we note a special feature of the correlation functions due to the long - range interactions , however , which is most clearly visible in the results for @xmath105 in figure  [ fig : ddc2ndtransition](b ) .",
    "there we observe that the long - range order has been replaced by exponential decay at short distances ( @xmath106 ) , but that this changes from exponential to a power law - decay . by fitting a function",
    "we find that in this region @xmath107 , with a constant @xmath108 .",
    "this is the same power law decay as the interaction term , as is consistent with similar results derived for other long - range spin models @xcite .",
    "physically , the correlations initially decay exponentially due to the primary influence on a given particle being from its nearest neighbours ( analogous to exponentially decaying correlations in the paramagnetic phase of an ising model ) . however , once correlations arising from nearest neighbour interactions become sufficiently small , long - distance correlations will be dominated by effects of the direct interaction between distant particles .",
    "thus , long range correlations are expected to decay at large distances with the same power as the interaction @xcite .     for the ground states of hamiltonian",

    "when the detuning is decreased from @xmath116 it becomes less favourable to occupy @xmath12 states in the system and therefore in the case of small @xmath20 , crystalline phases with larger spacing between these occupations appear in order to reduce the dipole - dipole interaction energy .",
    "for example , in figure  [ fig : ddc3rdtransition ] we show the ddc indicating an occupation of the states @xmath12 on every third site for @xmath117 and @xmath118 . to make this periodicity clearer , we present results for a system with @xmath119 sites . as in figure  [ fig : ddc2ndtransition ] , in figure  [ fig : ddc3rdtransition ] we observe the characteristic long range order in the ddc , combined with a marked peak on every third lattice site .",
    "again we find a phase transition away from crystalline order , with an exponential decay of @xmath91 exhibited for larger values of @xmath20 .",
    "note that the crystalline phase with 1/3 filling occurs in a much smaller region of parameter space than the crystalline phase with 1/2 filling .",
    "in what follows , we are interested in time - dependent creation of these crystalline states in the case of polar molecules or rydberg atoms loaded into an optical lattice .",
    "these systems will typically occupy @xmath120 lattice sites , with open boundary conditions generated by the unoccupied ends of the chain . thus , rather than attempting to derive the full phase diagram for an infinite system , we focus on the case of open boundary conditions relevant to the experiments .",

    "we now consider the many - body physics when many atoms in an optical lattice are simultaneously coupled to the state @xmath322 .",
    "we assume that either atoms are loaded into a optical lattice with tight radial confinement , so that we have one atom per site along a 1d tube , or that we have weak radial confinement and many atoms per site . in each case",
    ", we can assume that the ground - state atoms are confined to a single modefunction at each given lattice site , @xmath8 .",
    "in the case of a single atom per site , this is the wannier function for the lowest bloch band , and in the case of many ( weakly - interacting ) atoms it is the solution to the gross - pitaevskii equation in the mean - field limit .    in order to formulate the hamiltonian of the many - body system , we introduce field operators @xmath336 and @xmath337 , corresponding respectively to atoms in the ground and rydberg states , and obeying the standard bosonic ( or fermionic ) commutation relations .",
    "we assume that the timescale for excitation to the rydberg state is much shorter than timescales corresponding to the atomic motion , and that therefore we can neglect population of any modefunction other than the @xmath8 for either the ground or rydberg states . in this case",
    ", we can approximately expand the field operators in terms of mode operators corresponding to each of these modes , @xmath338 where both the initial field operators and the mode operators , @xmath339 and @xmath340 , obey the appropriate bosonic commutation or fermionic anti - commutation relations , depending on which atoms are used in the experiment .",
    "we can then write the hamiltonian for a lattice with @xmath40 sites as @xmath341 -    \\delta\\sum^n_k \\hat n_k    \\nonumber\\\\    & \\qquad+\\sum^n_k v^\\mathrm{on}_{\\mathrm{dd}}\\hat n_k ( \\hat n_k-1 )     + \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{dd}}}{2}\\sum^n_{k\\neq l } \\frac{\\hat n_k \\hat n_m}{|k - l|^3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath342 , @xmath343 . in the last term we have again neglected corrections to the shape of the interaction potential , which are of the order @xmath236 , with @xmath237 the characteristic harmonic oscillator length for the deep optical potential well on each site .",
    "the quantity @xmath344 is relevant only in the case that we initially have many atoms per site , and gives the energy offset due to the dipole - dipole interaction if two rydberg atoms are excited on the same site .",
    "we will assume that @xmath345 for @xmath346 and @xmath347 , so that the occupation of a single site by two rydberg atoms is far off - resonant and therefore the excitation of such a state is highly improbable .",
    "this phenomenon , which is known as the rydberg blockade , makes it possible to restrict the maximum number of rydberg atoms per site to one , such that @xmath348 can only assume the two eigenvalues @xmath349 and @xmath350 .    secondly , to arrive at a hamiltonian governing solely the dynamics of the rydberg excitations",
    ", we eliminate the creation and annihilation operators @xmath351 and @xmath352 in equation  ( [ eq : pre_working_hamiltonian ] ) . in the case where we have an initial ground state with a single atom per site , this is simply a relabelling of the state with a single ground state atom per site as the vacuum state of the operators @xmath353 . in the case where the mode function at each site is occupied by the same macroscopic number @xmath354 ,",
    "on the other hand , we make the replacement @xmath355 , in which case we define the effective rabi frequency as @xmath356 .",
    "the model we derive is exact under the stated assumptions when we have a fixed number of atoms per site ( e.g. , beginning deep in the mott insulator regime for bosons or in a band insulator for fermions ) , which is the ideal experimental realization .",
    "an approximation to the model can also be obtained in a weakly interacting gas , but with some inhomogeneity in @xmath20 for different lattice sites , both due to position - dependence of the mean density ( due to a trapping potential ) , and also due to number fluctuations between sites . in production of crystalline states via the adiabatic ramping process discussed below , we expect that the ramp is somewhat robust against these fluctuations , especially for high filling factor crystalline states . however , this depends on the details of the realization and the inhomogeneity in @xmath20 .",
    "thus , we arrive at the spin hamiltonian describing excitation of rydberg states , @xmath357 where the pauli matrix @xmath358 has been defined .",
    "this hamiltonian is equivalent to our model system from equation  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , with the states corresponding to @xmath359 and @xmath360 .",
    "the scheme presented in section  [ sec : dynam - cryst - state ] achieves a crystalline phase of rydberg excitations on very short timescales .",
    "however , whilst the preparation can be very fast compared to the lifetime of the rydberg states , this lifetime will pose an ultimate limit to the stability of the many - body state that is produced .",
    "one way around this is to transfer the excited rydberg states to alternative stable ground states .",
    "however , an important issue arises in this case because of the momentum kicks that arise due to the interactions between excited atoms , which can create very significant excitations in the motional states of the atoms .",
    "this is especially an issue towards the end of the chain , where the atoms will experience a force primarily in the direction away from the centre of the chain .",
    "these kicks can be estimated classically from the force acting due to the dipole - dipole interaction potential between excited rydberg state .",
    "for crystalline states one can estimate that the net momentum kick during the crystal preparation time decreases as @xmath361 , where @xmath85 denotes the @xmath85-th excited rydberg atom from the boundary and @xmath362 the periodicity of the crystal , i.e. with @xmath363 filling .",
    "quantitatively , transitions to higher bound states are given by the size of matrix elements @xmath364 , where @xmath365 @xmath366 denotes the higher band wannier modefunctions .",
    "thus the transition effects become small in the case that @xmath367 , where @xmath321 denotes the oscillator length , is small .",
    "the oscillator length is typically of the order of tens of nm and we can estimate the momentum kick of the boundary excitation for a @xmath62 filling crystal as roughly @xmath368 nm .",
    "thus , this will be a problem for atoms at the end of the chain in the @xmath62 case , but decreases rapidly for atoms away from the edge , or a larger periodicity in the crystal .",
    "one way to circumvent this problem for the case where all lattice sites are singly occupied would be to use induced dipoles rather than direct coupling to rydberg levels from the outset , as discussed in reference  @xcite . the idea is to make use of two stable ground states , one of which is coupled off - resonantly to a rydberg level , producing an induced dipole with a strength depending on the parameters of the coupling and the static dipole of the rydberg level . in this way , the coupling between ground and rydberg states in our model is replaced by the coupling between two stable ground states .",
    "this can be achieved , e.g. , via a two - photon transition .",
    "this results in much smaller values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( and hence also the interaction strength between excited atoms ) , which could even be made comparable to or less than the band gap in the optical lattice .",
    "the atoms would then always remain trapped in the lattice .",
    "the disadvantage of this method would be substantially increased times for the total adiabatic process , however , the ratio of the preparation time to spontaneous emission lifetime of the state could always be made large .",
    "this method would have the added benefit of a much smaller linewidth of the coupling field for the transition between interacting and non - interacting states . especially for crystal periodicities other than two lattice sites , the narrow regions of detuning @xmath369 for which the phases are found implies a strong condition on the stability of the laser detuning in an experiment ( and hence on the linewidth of the exciting laser ) .",
    "for example , a crystalline state with an excitation on every fourth site can be found in the region of @xmath370 for @xmath371 .",
    "using @xmath372 from the previous example , this means that the range of detuning values in which states of the character is found is approximately @xmath373 , and we require that the laser linewidth is smaller than this value .",
    "this is realistic , however for crystalline phases with even larger spacings between the excitations , the requirements become even stronger .",
    "if we use dressed dipoles , then we would be using a two - photon transition to couple between the states , for which the detuning can be controlled very accurately .",
    "in conclusion , using adiabatic sweeps of microwave or laser parameters , it is possible to form crystalline phases of strongly interacting states in either polar molecules or neutral atoms coupled to rydberg states in an optical lattice .",
    "the effective model hamiltonian exhibits a rich ground state phase diagram , with the crystalline order being destroyed as the coupling between states is increased . for typical experimental size scales and parameters",
    "we showed that preparation of crystalline structures can be achieved on reasonable timescales , and the structures can be detected by measurement of characteristic density - density correlation functions .",
    "the results we have obtained here motivate further study of the phase diagram with its lobe - like structure of different crystalline phases ( as indicated in figure  [ fig : gap ] ) .",
    "this also opens the opportunity to extend 1d time - dependent simulations to the study of crystal formation in regimes of significantly larger spacing than is studied here ( e.g. , using matrix product operator methods @xcite ) and also to probe time - dependent transitions between the different phases .",
    "this will also allow connections to current work in which rydberg excitations of randomly distributed atoms are studied @xcite .",
    "we thank hans peter bchler , ignacio cirac , markus mller , beatriz olmos sanchez , thomas pohl , hendrik weimer , and peter zoller for helpful discussions .",
    "we thank alexey gorshkov for helpful discussions , and for pointing out a small error in our original parameter estimation for polar molecules .",
