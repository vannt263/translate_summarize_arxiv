    "why should one be interested in supersymmetry ?",
    "until recently , the reasons have been principally theoretical .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is a beautiful extension of the poincar symmetry with new dimensions of space and time that explain the existence of fermions@xcite .",
    "it solves the hierarchy problem of widely separated electroweak and grand unified scales through cancellations among diagrams that give quadratically divergent higgs boson mass corrections .",
    "moreover supersymmetry may be a necessary consequence of string theory .",
    "the recent upswing in interest in supersymmetry derives from high precision measurements of standard model ( sm ) parameters at lep .",
    "renormalization group evolution with minimal sm particle content of the su(3 ) , su(2 ) , and u(1 ) couplings from @xmath2 do not converge at a single high scale , in contradiction with the prediction of the su(5 ) grand unified theory ( gut ) .",
    "however , with the minimal particle content of supersymmetry included , the evolution is in excellent agreement with lep data and suggests a grand unified scale at @xmath3 gev and effective susy mass scale within the range @xmath4 tev@xcite . encouraged by this success , the evolution of yukawa couplings is also being vigorously pursued , with yukawa unification constraints such as @xmath5 at the gut scale@xcite . while the unification of gauge and yukawa couplings is an extremely attractive feature ,",
    "the existence of supersymmetry will only be confirmed when new particle states are seen directly and the associated r - parity conservation or violation is tested in the production and decays of these supersymmetric particles .",
    "the idea of a radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry is an old but still popular one@xcite@xcite .",
    "it is very attractive to explain the breaking of the electroweak symmetry through large logarithms between the planck scale and the weak scale@xcite . for the radiative corrections to be strong enough to drive a higgs boson mass - squared parameter negative ( thus breaking the electroweak symmetry ) , a yukawa coupling of that higgs boson",
    "must be large at the gut scale . with the top quark mass large ( @xmath6 gev )",
    ", the susy gut unification can naturally explain the origin of the electroweak scale .",
    "a heavy top is required to drive one of the soft - supersymmetry breaking parameters ( a higgs doublet mass ) negative .",
    "today we know the top quark mass is large and that the top has a large yukawa coupling . there is a relationship between the electroweak scale and the top quark yukawa coupling through the rges ; consequently the radiative symmetry breaking mechanism has important consequences for the supersymmetric particle spectrum .",
    "indeed a large top yukawa coupling is the motivation for the fixed point solutions@xcite advocated recently in the context of gut theories@xcite@xcite .",
    "these solutions predict a linear relationship between @xmath7 and @xmath8 , given further constraints on the susy particle spectrum .",
    "there are at least two other motivations for supersymmetry . in the context of susy guts",
    ", the grand unification scale is raised sufficiently high to suppress proton decay to experimentally acceptable levels , when an additional r - parity symmetry is invoked .",
    "r - parity symmetry has an important consequence , providing the second additional motivation for supersymmetry  it implies that the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is stable .",
    "it is now generally believed that baryonic matter is insufficient to make up the total gravitationally interacting matter of the universe .",
    "the lsp provides a natural candidate for the ( cold ) dark matter of the universe , since the lsp is forbidden to decay into baryons by r - parity conservation .",
    "the greatest dilemma for supersymmetry is the unknown mechanism for supersymmetry breaking .",
    "since no supersymmetric partners of the known particles have been observed , one must not only explain why supersymmetry is broken , but also why it is broken in such a way that ( almost ) all of the supersymmetric partners are heavier than the known particles",
    ". typically one skirts the issue of the exact mechanism of supersymmetry breaking , and parametrizes one s ignorance by introducing soft - supersymmetry breaking parameters which characterize the scale of the masses of the supersymmetric particles . in the context of certain models ( minimal supergravity , no - scale supergravity , superstring - inspired , etc . )",
    "there are relations between these parameters at the gut scale that appear as universal boundary conditions .",
    "the values of the parameters would be determined in some still unknown fundamental theory , but in practice the models are described as depending on a few undetermined soft - supersymmetry breaking masses which , when evolved in the well - known effective theory below the unification scale , generate consequences for the masses and couplings of the susy particles that can be compared to experiment .",
    "the supersymmetry breaking in such models occurs through a hidden sector at some scale intermediate between the electroweak and planck scales .",
    "for example , there may exist an asymptotically free gauge theory in the hidden sector in which gaugino condensation or some other nonperturbative mechanism occurs at a high scale @xmath9 related by a geometric hierarchy to the planck and electroweak scales ( @xmath10 ) , thus breaking supersymmetry in the observable sector near the electroweak scale @xmath11 .",
    "since this breaking of supersymmetry occurs in the hidden sector which is coupled only gravitationally to the observable sector , the supersymmetry breaking is suppressed relative to the planck scale by factors of @xmath12 .",
    "this mechanism gives rise to an effective theory in the observable sector with softly broken global supersymmetry , giving the scale of the soft - supersymmetry breaking parameters near the electroweak scale .",
    "how the effective theory parameters are determined and related to each other depends on the details of the supersymmetry breaking scenario .",
