    "thus , classical qcd is scale invariant in the chiral limit @xmath1 .",
    "after the quantization , however , scale invariance is violated by the trace anomaly , and a scale appears in a nontrivial manner .",
    "this is called as dimensional transmutation . in this way , many dimensional quantities are created in real qcd , such as `` mass gap '' , vacuum condensates , and masses of hadrons .    as a result of the dimensional transmutation ,",

    "actually , even above @xmath5 , the running coupling constant is still large and the nonperturbative effect is important .",
    "since the energy scale is abstract concept , we have to define the energy scale in a more concrete way .",
    "we define the _ relevant energy scale _ for a qcd phenomenon as the energy - momentum component of gluons inducing the phenomenon .",

    "then , we can determine which energy - momentum component of the gluon field is relevant for the physical quantity .",
    "technically , we only have to replace @xmath47 instead of @xmath30 , and its operation ( mainly the fast fourier transformation ) is numerically easy compared to other parts of the simulations .",
    "this framework is applicable to almost all lattice qcd calculations , and widely useful for qcd phenomena .",
    "we comment on several points about this framework in the following .    1 .   in general ,",
    "since the gauge transformation is nonlocal in momentum space , the energy - momentum component of the gauge field is a gauge - dependent concept .",
    "the gauge fixing is needed and the result depends on the gauge choice . if we do not fix the gauge , the resulting expectation value is zero , even in the case of a gauge - invariant operator .",
    "it is possible that the projection in step 4 contaminates the original condition on the momentum cutoff . to evaluate how the projection affects link variables , we calculated @xmath52 by repeating steps 2 - 4 once again to @xmath47 , and check the overlap between them , @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "the overlap is found to be almost unity .",
    "for example , the average deviation from unity is about 0.1% at @xmath54 gev .",
    "thus , we can expect that the projection does not significantly affect the original momentum cutoff .",
    "3 .   in general gauges , since the gauge fixing and the momentum cutoff do not necessarily commute , it is nontrivial whether these two operations are satisfied simultaneously .",
    "in other words , @xmath47 can deviate from the gauge fixing condition which is originally imposed on @xmath30 .",
    "we have numerically checked that , in the case of the landau gauge , @xmath47 almost completely satisfies the landau gauge fixing condition , i.e. , @xmath55 $ ] is maximized .",
    "the landau gauge is known to suffer from the gribov copy problem @xcite .",
    "we numerically estimated the systematic uncertainty from the gribov ambiguity by random gauge transformation . in the cases of the wilson loop and plaquette ,",
    "its systematic error is smaller than the statistical error .",
    "the interquark potential is one of the most fundamental quantities in qcd and hadron physics .",
    "we here calculate the static quark - antiquark potential .",
    "the quark - antiquark potential , so - called the cornell potential @xcite , is given as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the interquark distance .",
    "the physical value of the string tension @xmath58 is approximately 0.89 gev / fm , and the coulomb coefficient @xmath59 is approximately 0.26 .",
    "the constant @xmath60 depends on the regularization .",
    "the quark - antiquark potential includes both perturbative and nonperturbative properties . in short range ,",
    "it is dominated by the perturbative one - gluon - exchange coulomb potential . in long range ,",
    "it is dominated by the nonperturbative linear confinement potential .",
    "the quark - antiquark potential is extracted from the expectation value of the wilson loop , which is a gauge - invariant path - ordered product of link variables along a loop . for statistical improvement",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      another interesting property of the low - lying dirac spectrum is that it is successfully described by chiral random matrix theory .",
    "chiral random matrix theory is an effective theory which describes the universal behavior of disordered systems @xcite .",
    "chiral random matrix theory suggests that the low - lying dirac spectrum depends only on the global symmetries of the system , and not on the details of the microscopic structure .",
    "once the validity of chiral random matrix theory is guaranteed , chiral random matrix theory enables us to predict the low - lying eigenvalue distribution by a simple and universal function .",

    "in chiral random matrix theory , the probability distribution of the lowest eigenvalue is given as @xmath68 for the su(3 ) quenched gauge field with @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "if one directly calculates the chiral condensate in infinite volume , this function is parameter free . in this study , we treated @xmath69 as a fitting parameter .",

    ", the qualitative behavior does not change .",
    "the lattice data is still reproduced by eq .",
    "( [ eqp ] ) .",
    "thus , the high - momentum gluon is irrelevant for the universality of the lowest eigenvalue distribution .",
    "the best - fit value of @xmath69 is changed by the uv cutoff .",
    "this is because the chiral condensate is renormalization - group variant and uv divergent . by definition ,",
    "the uv divergent quantity depends on the uv cutoff , although this might be irrelevant for phenomenology .    for @xmath72 gev ,",
    "the lowest eigenvalue distribution becomes to concentrate on the vicinity of the free eigenvalue .",
    "the lattice data drastically deviates from eq .",
    "( [ eqp ] ) . therefore , the low - momentum gluon is crucial for the validity of chiral random matrix theory .",
    "in other words , the low - momentum component induces the strong - interacting and disordered nature of the gauge field .    in the calculation of the chiral condensate in chapter 6",
    ", the zero - momentum component has a large contribution to the chiral condensate . to check it , we calculated the dirac spectrum with the small ir cutoff @xmath73 gev . for @xmath73 gev",
    ", the lattice data can be fitted by eq .",
    "( [ eqp ] ) with the best - fit value @xmath74 .",
    "the contribution of the zero - momentum component is indeed large , about 15% of the total .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the result in chapter 6 .",
    "note , however , that this is quantitatively different because the lattice action and the lattice spacing are different .",
    "we have introduced the lattice framework to analyze the relation between a qcd phenomenon and the energy - momentum component of the gluon field . in this framework , using the fourier transformation of the link variable , we construct the momentum - space link variable , remove some energy - momentum components , and reconstruct the coordinate - space link variable .",
    "this framework is applicable to many lattice qcd calculations . we have applied this framework to the analysis of color confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .    as for color confinement",
    ", we have analyzed the quark - antiquark potential , the color flux tube , and meson masses . from the quantitative analysis of the quark - antiquark potential",
    ", we have found that the confinement potential is induced by the low - momentum component below 1.5 gev in the landau gauge .",
    "the low - momentum component below 1.5 gev produces the linear interquark potential , and the high - momentum component above 1.5 gev produces the coulomb - like interquark potential without confinement . as one application of this result , by restricting the gluon field to the high - momentum component above 1.5 gev , we can extract the color flux tube from the action density distribution .",
    "in addition , when this low - momentum component is removed , the two quarks in mesons are not confined and become quasi - free .    as for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ,",
    "we have analyzed the chiral condensate and the dirac spectrum .",
    "the chiral condensate is induced by the broad low - momentum region , even above 1.5 gev .",
    "this behavior is also observed in the analysis of the dirac spectrum .",
    "this dependence on the momentum cutoff is different from that of color confinement .",
    "the present result suggests that spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is induced by higher energy - momentum component of gluons , compared to color confinement .",
    "this behavior is consistent with phenomenological models @xcite . for more conclusive statement",
    ", we have to take into account many systematics , especially , the sea quark effects in the case of realistic qcd .",
    "we have also analyzed topological charge in the two ways : the fermionic way through the dirac zero mode and the field theoretical way through the gauge field distribution .",
    "the momentum cutoff gradually affects the dirac spectrum and the zero modes , and then changes the topological charge .",
    "this is similar to the behavior of the chiral condensate .    in this framework",
    ", we need gauge fixing , and the obtained result depends on the gauge choice . nevertheless , this analysis is important in the following theoretical viewpoints .",
    "first , the relevant energy scale , i.e. , the energy - momentum component inducing a qcd phenomenon , would be useful for developing effective theories . an effective theory has some cutoff to simplify physics or to reduce degrees of freedom .",
    "although the value of the cutoff should be based on some physical reasoning , its microscopic derivation is difficult in many cases .",
    "the relevant energy scale obtained by lattice qcd would provides a physical reasoning for the cutoff value .",
    "for example , by setting the uv cutoff to be 1.5 gev in momentum integral , we can safely pick up the contribution to color confinement .",
    "further , the relevant energy scale determines degrees of freedom which appear in the effective field theory @xcite .",
    "second , this analysis reveals the relation between different qcd phenomena in terms of the energy - momentum component of the gauge field .",
    "we studied the connection between color confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "such connection would be important for understanding their underlying mechanisms .",
    "also , based on the connection between the confinement potential and the color flux tube , we succeeded in extracting the color flux tube from the gluon distribution .",
    "third , this framework has a technical advantage in numerical simulation .",
    "as shown in chapter 4 , the statistical fluctuation of the action density is strongly suppressed by removing the uv components .",
    "this is because the statistical fluctuation is mainly given by the high - frequency mode , i.e. , the uv component of the link variable .",
    "the statistical error is one major difficulty in lattice qcd .",
    "this framework can reduce the statistical error without changing the target ir physics @xcite .",
