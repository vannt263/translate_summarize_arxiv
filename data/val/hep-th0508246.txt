    "strong coupling expansions in theoretical physics have a longstanding tradition . one should consider fluid dynamics where two different regimes of motions were found depending on what term of the navier - stokes equation is taken as a perturbation @xcite .",
    "boundary layer problems in perturbation theory firstly appeared in this way @xcite . in the seventies",
    "attempts to build a strong coupling expansion for quantum field theory were put forward by bender and colleagues @xcite .",
    "these latter expansions faced the problem of the dependence on a cut - off that was not possible to dispose of in a well definite manner .",
    "the idea behind was simple and smart : for a self - interacting scalar field the perturbation is not the potential but the kinetic term .",
    "what makes these methods rather interesting is that they exploit an evident symmetry in the choice of the perturbation in a differential equation .",
    "this choice is arbitrary and different perturbation schemes can be devised depending on it .",
    "so , one may ask what is the relationship between different series .",
    "this matter was exploited in ref . where a theorem was proved showing that in the strong coupling expansion for a quantum system the leading order is obtained by the adiabatic theorem in quantum mechanics .",
    "this striking result was further analyzed in ref .",
    "showing how the proper expansions can be obtained in different regimes for some hamiltonians in quantum optics .",
    "a duality principle holds that interchanging the terms in the perturbation series means to obtain a series with the reversed ordering parameter .",
    "a successful application of this idea in quantum field theory has been recently given @xcite .",
    "the leading order is given by the adiabatic theorem in quantum mechanics for the schrdinger equation but this result is indeed ubiquitous and we will show it as a generic result for a strong coupling expansion for a differential equation .",
    "this theorem will permit us to extend the above analysis to einstein equations in vacuum in the form given in the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) formalism @xcite .",
    "indeed , a strongly perturbed system , understood as a system undergoing a largely increasing perturbation , becomes a system with an increasingly slow dynamics , that is , an adiabatic system .",
    "more importantly for our aims is the fact that these equations behave homogeneously with respect to the spatial variable in a regime that appears dual , in the sense of perturbation theory @xcite , to the case of the gravitational waves that represent small perturbations on a given spacetime .    the relevance of this result for the einstein equations is easily understood being open up several problems that presently only a numerical treatment can manage with all the shortcomings that this implies @xcite .",
    "one of the questions that could benefit from a strong coupling analysis is the singularity problem @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is well - known that while theorems exist due to penrose and hawking @xcite proving the existence of singularities in the solutions of the einstein equations , but very few is known about the nature of such solutions and their behavior near the singularity itself .",
    "our approach permits to analyze the einstein equations in a regime of very intense gravitational field and then to get an answer to this problem .",
    "indeed , our approach permits to conclude that the dynamics near the singularity is described by homogeneous solutions of the einstein equations and some numerical results hint in this direction @xcite .",
    "what we are going to show is that a dual expansion exists to the weak field one that is commonly used to study gravitational radiation@xcite .",
    "the main result we obtain in this way is that the leading order equations are just the homogeneous part of the einstein equations .",
    "this reduces the spatial dependence to parameters in the integration constants and the gauge choice at this order .",
    "this in turn means that in a regime of strong gravitational field the solutions to be considered are the homogeneous ones .",
    "we will see that in two dimensions the situation is quite similar producing a non - singular solution but with an analogous duality between weak and strong field solutions . as a by - product",
    "we will obtain a strong coupling expansion for the gravity in two dimensions as described by the liouville equation@xcite .",
    "we will show the agreement with the exact solution giving full consistency to our approach for a well known non - linear case .",
    "this will yield a start up to our perturbation procedure toward the final proof .",
    "the paper is so structured . in sec.[sec2 ] we present duality in perturbation theory and the adiabatic approximation at the leading order . in sec.[sec3 ] the approach , in a general adm - like setting , is applied to two dimensional gravity . in sec.[sec4 ] the method is applied to einstein equations in vacuum in the adm formalism . in sec.[sec5a",
    "] we give some applications showing the @xmath0 behavior of the perturbation series .",
    "finally , in sec.[sec5 ] conclusions are given .",
    "in this section we will show how a duality principle holds in perturbation theory showing how to derive a strong coupling expansion with the leading order ruled by an adiabatic dynamics in order to study the evolution of a physical system .",
    "we consider the following perturbation problem @xmath1 being @xmath2 an arbitrary ordering parameter : as is well known an expansion parameter is obtained by the computation of the series itself .",
    "the standard approach assume the limit @xmath3 and putting @xmath4 one gets the equations for the series @xmath5 where a derivative with respect to the ordering parameter is indicated by a prime .",
    "we recognize here a conventional small perturbation theory as it should be .",
    "but the ordering parameter is just a conventional matter and so one may ask what does it mean to consider @xmath6 as a perturbation instead with respect to the same parameter .",
    "indeed one formally could write the set of equations @xmath7 where we have interchanged @xmath6 and @xmath8 and renamed the solution as @xmath9 .",
    "the question to be answered is what is the expansion parameter now and what derivative the prime means . to answer this question we rescale the time variable as @xmath10 into eq.([eq : eq1 ] ) obtaining the equation @xmath11 and let us introduce the small parameter @xmath12 .",
    "it easy to see that applying again the small perturbation theory to the parameter @xmath13 we get the set of equations ( [ eq : set ] ) but now the time is scaled as @xmath14 , that is , at the leading order the development parameter of the series will enter into the scale of the time evolution producing a proper slowing down ruled by the equation @xmath15 that we can recognize as an equation for adiabatic evolution that in the proper limit @xmath13 will give the static solution @xmath16 .",
    "we never assume this latter solution but rather we will study the evolution of eq.([eq : lead ] ) .",
    "finally , the proof is complete as we have obtained a dual series @xmath17 by simply interchanging the terms for doing perturbation theory .",
    "this is a strong coupling expansion holding in the limit @xmath18 dual to the small perturbation theory @xmath3 we started with and having an adiabatic equation at the leading order .",
    "it is interesting to note that , for a partial differential equation , we can be forced into a homogeneous equation because , generally , if we require also a scaling into space variables we gain no knowledge at all on the evolution of a physical system . on the other side ,",
    "requiring a scaling on the space variables and not on the time variable will wash away any evolution of the system .",
    "so , on most physical systems a strong perturbation means also a homogeneous solution but this is not a general rule . as an example one should consider fluid dynamics where two regimes dual each other can be found depending if it is the eulerian or the navier - stokes term to prevail",
    ". in general relativity things stay in a way to get a homogeneous equation at the leading order .",
    "the reason for this is that products of derivatives or second order derivatives in space coordinates are the only elements forming the einstein tensor beside time dependence .",
    "this completes the analysis initially realized in quantum mechanics in ref . permitting a direct application to general relativity",
    "as is well - known a direct computation of the ricci tensor in two dimensions gives zero proving that two - dimensional general relativity is trivial .",
    "this is due to conformal invariance of the theory in two dimensions .",
    "different proposals have appeared to have non trivial solutions and one of the most common theories is offered by the liouville model @xcite that has had a lot of applications also in string theory@xcite .",
    "our aim in this section is to obtain a dual perturbation series to the weak perturbation series as given in @xcite for this model of two dimensional gravity in order just to give a scheme of working of the machinery to be also applied to the full four dimensional case .",
    "so , let us write the general line element in two dimensions in the form proper to adm formalism @xmath19dt^2 + 2\\beta_1(x , t)dtdx+\\gamma(x , t ) dx^2\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath20 for the lapse function , @xmath21 for the shift function and @xmath22 the metric factor in one dimension .",
    "we can simplify the metric by taking the shift factor to be zero , so in the following @xmath23 and this gives @xmath24 that for the equation @xmath25 , with @xmath26 the ricci scalar and @xmath27 a constant , yields the adm equations @xmath28 with the freedom to fix the gauge function @xmath29 to compute @xmath30 , the extrinsic curvature , and @xmath31 .",
    "a natural choice in this case is to put @xmath32 to make explicit the conformal invariance of the metric but other choices are also possible .",
    "this gives back the liouville equation @xcite @xmath33 with the introduction of the field @xmath34 and being @xmath27 the only parameter of the theory .",
    "indeed , a small perturbation theory is obtained by the explicit solution@xcite @xmath35 being @xmath36 a solution of the equation @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be expressed by the functions @xmath39 or @xmath40 with light cone coordinates as @xmath41 .",
    "as one can see in this case the start - up solution is a solution of the free theory .",
    "eqs.([eq:2dset ] ) can be immediately used with the perturbation method of sec.[sec2 ] but this application is not so straightforward as one could think .",
    "there is a subtle point to take into account as also will happen for the full dimensional case .",
    "indeed , we note that the lapse function @xmath29 and the metric factor @xmath31 are both without physical dimensions so the extrinsic curvature @xmath30 has dimension @xmath42 $ ] as the derivative .",
    "this means that when we rescale time variable , we have also to rescale @xmath30 properly . as the variable of our expansion is @xmath27 we see that we have to do the following scale changing @xmath43 but we can take into account of the rescaling in the extrinsic curvature in its series development as @xmath44 as said we also assume the gauge to be fixed with the conformal choice @xmath45 . with the substitution @xmath46 the adm equations",
    "become @xmath47 from which is straightforwardly obtained the liouville equation taking into account that @xmath48 .",
    "the liouville equation is exactly solvable by two arbitrary functions that depend on light cone coordinates @xcite .",
    "it also follows the following set of perturbation equations @xmath49 being @xmath50 and we have adopted for @xmath51 the same scaling of the extrinsic curvature @xmath30 and we have considered @xmath52 . at the leading order these equations give the homogeneous liouville equation as it should be expected @xmath53 that has the solution @xmath54\\ ] ] so that @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath56 and @xmath57 are two integration constants that can depend on @xmath58 but not on @xmath27 otherwise the perturbation series would lose meaning . when @xmath56 and @xmath57 are taken not depending on @xmath58 eq.([eq:2dsol ] ) is an exact solution to the liouville equation as can also be proved taking the general solution to this equation @xcite and expressing it by light cone coordinates .",
    "then , higher order corrections are not zero when e.g. @xmath56 is taken to be dependent on @xmath58 . assuming for the sake of simplicity @xmath59 , being @xmath60 a constant , the equation to solve is @xmath61 being @xmath62 whose solution is trivially given by @xmath63 that is @xmath64 and to second order @xmath65 we see that one has a series in @xmath66 as it should be in agreement with the exact solution given by @xmath67 and at the end of computation we can fix the constant @xmath57 as to have the scale factor @xmath68 as a renormalization factor giving again an exact solution @xmath69.\\ ] ] we see that the ground state limit @xmath70 corresponds to the dispersion relation @xmath71 producing a null metric .",
    "besides , the dual weak coupling limit @xmath72 gives a `` gravitational wave''-like solution in a complete analogy with the four dimensional case as we will see .",
    "finally , we have effectively got a series expansion in the parameter @xmath73 dual to the small perturbation theory and in agreement with our adiabatic hypothesis in sec.[sec2 ] .",
    "the leading order is ruled by the homogeneuos liouville equation . besides",
    ", our approach led us directly to exact solutions of the equation itself .",
    "some interesting conclusions can be drawn from the `` cosmological '' solution ( [ eq:2dsol ] ) .",
    "the metric factor is given by @xmath74 that has the property to become a constant in the limit @xmath75 and this situation is quite different from the full dimensional theory where from kasner solution one can see that metric blows up .",
    "this conformal factor becomes zero in the opposite limit @xmath76 but generally our strong coupling expansion should have a proper time scale given by the rescaling parameter @xmath27 .",
    "as this parameter becomes larger also the time scale we are able to analyze increases . in the present case we are in the favorable situation that the perturbation terms contain global informations .",
    "finally let us point out that such a kind of cosmological solutions was found in string theory @xcite .",
    "our approach for the case of einstein equations in vacuum will be on the same lines as for the two dimensional case",
    ". we would like to point out that the ground to reach our aim is derived from numerical general relativity as devised e.g. in ref .. this means that we consider einstein equations in the adm formalism in a coordinate basis explicitly given by the set @xcite @xmath77 \\\\",

    "the gauge freedom corresponds to fixing @xmath29 and @xmath79 while @xmath80 is to be considered a fundamental variable of the theory .",
    "@xmath81 is the extrinsic curvature also a fundamental variable of the theory to be solved for .",
    "four constraint equations also hold @xmath82 being @xmath83 the ricci scalar for @xmath84 and @xmath85 the corresponding covariant derivative",
    ". we do not worry about the constraint equations in the following while these are relevant matter in numerical computations .",
    "on the basis of the duality principle in perturbation theory discussed above , we want to prove that in a strong gravitational field the spatial part of the einstein equations , at the leading order , can be neglected and this behavior is exactly dual to the case of the gravitational radiation in weak field expansion , a situation modeled in a very simple form in the case of the liouville equation .",
    "our analysis starts from a small perturbation theory that can be derived from the adm equations by fixing the gauge freedom as e.g. @xmath86 then we take @xmath87 being @xmath88 the flat spatial metric , but other choices are also possible , and in this case @xmath89 , and @xmath2 an ordering parameter to define the expansion @xcite .",
    "the ordering parameter @xmath2 is introduced here just as a computational tool to obtain the perturbation series . as said in sec.[sec2 ] this is a standard approach in perturbation theory .",
    "the proper parameter emerges naturally after the series is computed if the series exists and this is the case as we are going to prove both for @xmath3 , the known case , and @xmath18 .",
    "so , the equations we get are @xmath90 that as expected display at the leading order the dynamics of gravitational waves .",
    "different choices of the gauge freedom do not change the physics .",
    "the leading order is ruled just by the linear part of einstein equations . in this way we recognize the standard weak field expansion @xcite that holds for @xmath3 .",
    "we now compute the dual series to the weak field expansion and we will show that the situation is quite similar to the two dimensional case with the notable difference that solutions of einstein equations have singularities . as said , in order to get a non trivial expansion we have to consider the following settings @xmath91 while the shift vector @xmath79 is taken to be zero .",
    "the following set of equations is so obtained @xmath92 \\\\",

    "\\nonumber      & \\vdots&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so , we succeeded in the derivation of a non trivial set of equations for a strong coupling expansion of the einstein equation .",
    "we see that in this case we have to take @xmath18 to make the expansion meaningful .",
    "this is the main result of the paper that permits us to draw the following conclusions . at the leading order",
    "the set of equations that rules the dynamics is that part of the einstein equations that holds for an homogeneous spacetime .",
    "so , unless boundary or initial conditions happen to depend on spatial coordinates , only the time variable appear to be significant in a strong gravitational field .",
    "it is interesting to notice here that in the above equations the nonlinear part of einstein equations has taken the role of the linear part that we have seen to rule the weak field perturbation theory and a direct evidence of the duality principle in perturbation theory as discussed in sec.[sec2 ] .",
    "the situation is exactly mirroring the case of the two dimensional gravity by the liouville equation with the difference that here we have a singular behavior .",
    "indeed , we see that due to the peculiar structure of the einstein equations this should not come out as a surprise .",
    "the most important conclusion to be drawn from this result is that in a strong gravitational field , that is near a singularity , the spacetime is indeed homogeneous reaching the conclusion we aimed to .",
    "this is the well - known belinski - khalatnikov - lifshitz ( bkl ) conjecture @xcite .",
    "indeed , one can complete the proof by assuming @xmath93 in the identical way as we did for the weak field perturbation theory .",
    "this just simplifies the equations without changing the conclusions consistently with the duality principle in perturbation theory .",
    "finally we note that the computation of higher order corrections can be done near a singularity displaying the corrections due to irregularities in the spacetime as one departs from the singularity when proper boundary conditions are given .",
    "two main points should be addressed to complete our proof .",
    "indeed , one should understand how general are the above equations with respect to a simple rephrasing of the bkl solutions .",
    "but eqs.([eq : set ] ) are able to express more general physical situations as also we will see in the next section .",
    "a typical situation is given by a strongly perturbed black hole that can be studied .",
    "interesting applications should be also given beyond the close approximation in collision between black holes @xcite .",
    "the other point is the meaning of the rescaling in time . we know that a small perturbation theory is just a series in @xmath38 , being @xmath38 the newton constant .",
    "a dual expansion has meaning as an expansion of @xmath94 , being @xmath95 a positive integer as we will see below . in turn",
    ", this means that the scaling of time as @xmath96 in this limit implies a prevalence of time variable with respect to other ones into the evolution equations .",
    "this should be compared with the formal parameter @xmath2 introduced above .",
    "it is interesting to note that what we have here is a gradient expansion @xcite that now appears the dual counterpart to the weak expansion for a gravitational field giving us an interesting interpretation of this expansion as the strong coupling series for general relativity .",
    "in order to show in a given example that a gradient expansion is indeed a @xmath0 perturbation series we consider a perturbation on a schwarzschild black hole and analyze it very near the horizon of the singularity .",
    "first of all , when one puts ( @xmath97 is the schwarzschild radius ) @xmath98 into eqs.([eq : set ] ) , it is easily verified that higher order corrections are all zero as it should be as the schwarzschild solution is exact .",
    "this is a very easy consistency check .",
    "now , we change the physical situation by imposing on the lapse function the choice @xmath99 that is we perturb the black hole with a radial perturbation of pulsation @xmath100 and amplitude @xmath101 .",
    "this is a standard approach to perturbation in general relativity .",
    "what we want to check is the behavior with respect to @xmath38 of the first order correction .",
    "the solution of eqs.([eq : set ] ) is straightforward to obtain giving the following solutions @xmath102 \\\\ \\nonumber      \\gamma_{\\theta\\theta } & = & -r^2      \\left[1 - 2a_0 ^ 2\\left(1-\\frac{r_g}{r}\\right)\\frac{r}{r_g}\\frac{3 - 4\\cos{\\omega t}+\\cos{2\\omega t}}{4\\omega^2 r^2 }      -2a_0\\left(1-\\frac{r_g}{r}\\right)^2\\frac{r}{r_g }      \\frac{\\omega t-\\sin{\\omega t}}{\\omega^2 r^2}+\\ldots\\right ] \\\\ \\nonumber      \\gamma_{\\phi\\phi } & = & \\gamma_{\\theta\\theta}\\sin^2\\theta.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , when we approach the horizon of the singularity , that is for @xmath103 , it is easy to get @xmath104 \\\\",
    "\\nonumber      \\gamma_{\\theta\\theta } & \\approx & -r^2 \\\\",
    "\\nonumber      \\gamma_{\\phi\\phi } & = & \\gamma_{\\theta\\theta}\\sin^2\\theta.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we recognize that the first order correction goes like @xmath105 that is , it is a @xmath106 term .",
    "this is consistent with our expectations given in the preceding section .    as a final consideration , we know that the gradient expansion at the leading order admits the cosmological solutions due to belinski - khalatnikov - lifshitz ( bkl ) @xcite . in view of our analysis , these solutions are a generic effect at the leading order of a @xmath0 expansion , and so they appear as a rather general behavior in such physical situations supporting recent numerical findings @xcite describing the behavior of solutions of the einstein equations near a singularity that seems to be homogeneous in space .",
    "we have built an expansion for einstein equations in vacuum for the description of a strong gravitational field .",
    "the main conclusion is that the spacetime is homogeneous near a singularity .",
    "an open question is left : what is the proper bianchi solution in the neighborhood of a singularity ?",
    "the kind of bianchi spacetime to be considered relies in the end on the proper setting of the initial conditions .",
    "two other important conclusions to be drawn is that spacetime near the singularity of the big bang was homogeneous .",
    "a future theory of quantum gravity will have the duty to explain such a behavior near a singular point of the classical theory .",
    "further studies are deserved when matter is present . in this case",
    "the nature of the singularity may change @xcite .",
    "so , we have reached relevant conclusions by the analysis of the einstein equations in vacuum in a strong coupling regime .",
    "a lot of physics could be extracted by further analysis of this perturbation equations in different situations that at present can be managed only numerically .",
    "this paper has been inspired by the beautiful lectures on general relativity of vladimir belinski that i listened at university of rome on 1992 where i learned for the first time about bkl solution and gravitational solitons .",
