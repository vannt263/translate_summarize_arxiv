    "0 the irreversibility of the observable phenomena has always been an intriguing fact that needed an explanation . in quantum field theory the irreversibility is usually associated with the renormalization group ( rg ) flow .",
    "although it is very difficult to give a general proof of the irreversibility this proof exists in two space - time dimensions and is known as the c - theorem @xcite . for 2d @xmath0-models , as those arising in string theory , this proof assumes compactness of the target space @xcite , @xcite .",
    "generalization of the c - theorem to higher dimensions and more general class of theories is not straightforward . in general ,",
    "a rather complicated and even chaotic behavior of the rg flow is possible @xcite .",
    "the irreversibility of time evolution is usually associated with the notion of entropy in a coarse - grained description of system when the detail knowledge about the individual states is lost for the advantage of having an effective description of a huge number of such states . yet",
    "the entropy can be associated with geometry in the case the coarse - grained states are residing entirely inside a compact surface .",
    "this entropy is known as entanglement ( or geometric ) entropy and is due to the quantum correlations between the subsystems divided by the surface .",
    "entanglement entropy is determined by geometry of the surface and , in this sense , reminds the bekenstein - hawking entropy of black holes .",
    "in fact , the study of entanglement entropy in the past was mainly motivated by the hope to find a statistical - mechanical explanation to the black hole entropy @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently , entanglement entropy has been in the focus of studies in condensed matter as an appropriate quantity that measures quantum entanglement in the quantum - mechanical systems @xcite-@xcite .",
    "although a great deal is known about entanglement entropy of various systems its irreversibility was not fully revealed .",
    "a natural guess is that the irreversibility should be understood with respect to the rg flow .",
    "a relation between entanglement entropy in two - dimensional field theory and the c - theorem was discussed in @xcite . on the other hand , the recent work @xcite investigates how entanglement entropy of certain two - dimensional spin chain models changes under the rg flow .",
    "it is found that the entanglement entropy is monotonically decreasing along the rg trajectory in this case .",
    "this is interpreted as loss of entanglement in the infra - red regime .",
    "the rg flow is not directly relevant to entanglement entropy of black holes since the entropy is entirely due to the presence of the black hole and is nontrivial even in the case when interactions , and , hence , the non - trivial renormalization group flow are absent in the field system .",
    "in this note we suggest that entanglement entropy of a black hole decreases monotonically under the ricci flow .",
    "the latter is analogous to the rg flow .",
    "these two flows are , in fact , related for the two - dimensional @xmath0-models with the riemann manifold as target space @xcite .",
    "the ricci flow @xcite , @xcite plays an important role in the problem of geometrization of 3-dimensional manifolds .",
    "the recent enthusiasm regarding the ricci flow has been sparked of course by works of perelman @xcite . for elementary review on the ricci flow",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , a review on the recent development is @xcite .",
    "some applications of the ricci flow and , in particular , of perelman s results to the physics models are discussed in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "our main focus in this note is on the two - dimensional case when the metric evolving under the ricci flow describes a 2d black hole .",
    "we first remind the reader some facts about entanglement entropy and present an exact expression for the entropy of 2d black hole which is due to a two - dimensional conformal field .",
    "we then discuss the properties of the ricci flow in two dimensions putting focus on whether the property of metric to describe black hole changes under the flow .",
    "we finally show that entanglement entropy is monotonically decreasing along the ricci flow provided the scalar curvature of the initial metric is positive .",
    "our result looks similar to the one obtained in @xcite for the rg flow and , perhaps , there is a reason why the entanglement entropy should decrease .",
    "0 entanglement entropy is defined for a system divided into two subsystems ( l and r ) and is due to the short - range correlations that are present in the system .",
    "the notion of entanglement entropy is ideally suited for black holes since the black hole horizon naturally divides the space - time on two subsystems so that an observer outside a black hole does not have access to excitations propagating inside the horizon .",
    "assume , that the whole system of a quantum field @xmath1 , that takes values @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the subsystems l and r respectively , is in a pure ground state @xmath4 that is the functional of both @xmath3 and @xmath2 modes .",
    "for an observer who has access only to one subsystem , say r , it is more reasonable to introduce a density matrix @xmath5 \\psi^*_0 ( \\phi_r^1 , \\phi_l ) \\psi_0 ( \\phi^2_r , \\phi_l ) \\label{22.2}\\ ] ] where one traces over all modes @xmath2 .",
    "entanglement entropy is defined as @xmath6    applying this construction to a 2d black hole ( for a general case see @xcite ) , we identify all modes inside the black hole horizon with l - modes that are to be traced over .",
    "the ground state of the black hole is given by the euclidean functional integral @xcite over fields defined on a half of the euclidean black hole space - time @xmath7 defined for values @xmath8 of angular coordinate @xmath9 .",
    "the inverse hawking temperature @xmath10 is determined by the derivative of the metric function @xmath11 on the horizon ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) .",
    "functions @xmath3 and @xmath2 that enter as arguments in ( [ 22.1 ] ) are the fixed values at the boundaries @xmath14 ; @xmath15 , giving the boundary condition in the path integral .",
    "the density matrix @xmath16 , obtained by tracing over @xmath2-modes , is defined by the path integral over fields on the full black hole instanton @xmath17 , with a cut along the @xmath18 axis and taking values @xmath19 above and below the cut . the trace @xmath20 is obtained by equating the fields across the cut and doing the unrestricted euclidean path integral on the complete black hole instanton @xmath21 .",
    "analogously , @xmath22 is given by the path integral over fields defined on @xmath23 , a @xmath24-fold cover of @xmath21 .",
    "thus , @xmath23 is the manifold with an abelian isometry ( generated by vector @xmath25 ) with horizon @xmath26 as a stationary point . near @xmath26",
    "the @xmath23 looks as a cone @xmath27 with tip at @xmath26 and the angle deficit @xmath28 .",
    "this construction can be analytically continued to arbitrary ( non - integer ) @xmath29 .",
    "the calculation of entanglement entropy thus reduces to a calculation of the functional integral on a gravitational background with a conical singularity . in two dimensions , for a conformal field , the result of the functional integration is the non - local polyakov action .",
    "the entropy calculation thus can be carried out explicitly . for a black hole metric written in the conformal form",

    "we finally obtain that _ s()=-c12r(0 , )  , where @xmath159 is the value of the ricci scalar at horizon .",
    "as we discussed this in section 3 the everywhere positive ricci scalar remains positive under the ricci flow .",
    "thus , if the initial black hole metric has @xmath160 for all @xmath161 then entanglement entropy is monotonically decreasing under the ricci flow .",
    "note that the ricci scalar is positive in the case of important 2d metrics : the schwarzschild metric with @xmath162 and the string - inspired black hole metric with @xmath163 . since for the monotonicity of entanglement entropy we need the ricci scalar to be positive only at the horizon it is possible that one can relax the condition on the ricci scalar of the initial metric and admit metrics with @xmath53 changing the sign far from the horizon .",
    "it would be interesting to analyze this possibility .",
    "it should be noted that the evolution of the entanglement entropy does not stop when the metric reaches the stationary point ( [ gst ] ) . although the metric components do not depend on @xmath66 in this case , the size @xmath155 of the box in metric ( [ metric2 ] ) changes monotonically with @xmath66 , @xmath164 .",
    "the monotonicity of the entropy for the stationary metric , _",
    "=- c12b_0 ^ 2<0  , then is entirely due to the monotonicity of the entropy as function of the size ( [ mons ] ) .",
    "0 with almost every known definition of entropy it is closely associated a property to change monotonically under the change of certain parameters .",
    "this property indicates the underlying irreversibility and motivates the actual usage of word `` entropy '' in each case .",
    "entanglement entropy is an interesting quantity that has various applications .",
    "defined in two dimensions for the quantum mechanical non - gravitational systems it was shown to be monotonic under the renormalization group flow @xcite . the gravitational analog of the rg flow is the ricci flow .",
    "in fact , the both flows are related for the two - dimensional @xmath0-models whose target space is the riemann manifold . in particular , this manifold may be noncompact and may describe a black hole as it was demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "the usual c - theorem does not immediately apply to the noncompact case @xcite .",
    "thus , it is desirable to identify a quantity that changes monotonically under the rg flow in this case . in this note",
    "we have shown that entanglement entropy , defined for a two - dimensional black hole metric , is monotonically decreasing under the ricci flow .",
    "the necessary condition for the monotonicity is the positiveness of the ricci scalar at the black hole horizon . in the case of the @xmath0-model",
    "this allows us to assign with the evolving metric an important quantity that characterizes both the irreversibility of the rg flow and the irreversible loss of information due to the black hole .              c.  g.  callan and f.  wilczek , phys .",
