    "peter west and his coworkers@xcite have recently shown that a non - linear realization of the @xmath0 kac - moody algebra contains all the ingredients of m - theory .",
    "in particular , it contains 11-dimensional supergravity which is formulated in the normal lagrangian scheme@xcite .",
    "+   + here i will present a quantum theory version of their theory .",
    "i perform the quantization using neither the customary path integral method nor heisenberg s canonical commutation relation method .",
    "instead , i employ the current algebra method that i developed some time ago@xcite .",
    "the usual canonical commutation ( or anti - commutation ) relations pertain among extensive variables , but the current algebra method utilizes intensive variables -currents- to set up commutation relations .",
    "therefore , the algebra is based on the symmetry of the physical system described by a lie algebra or its extension - a kac - moody algebra . in fact , as i will show later in this paper , the idea of current - field identity@xcite is built into our formalism , so that the commutation relations i adopt are both canonical and lie algebraic ( or rather kac - moody algebraic ) .",
    "+   + some examples of the field - current identity in our case are : ( 1 ) the gravitino field integrated over space yields the supersymmetry generator ; ( 2 ) the space integral of the spin connection provides the lorentz generator in the flat tangent space ; and , ( 3 ) the space integral of the elfbein field is the energy - momentum in the tangent space .",
    "+   + another important aspect of utilizing intensive variables is that i have no way to write down a local lagrangian in terms of these variables .",
    "how , then , can i derive quantum equations of motion without the lagrangian ?",
    "this is where the schwinger commutation relationcamong energy - momentum tensor comes in .",
    "historically , schwinger@xcite derived these relations in his 1963 papers assuming existence of a certain lagrangian for the extensive variables .",
    "i assume his commutation relations are valid generally even when energy - momentum is written in terms of intensive variables such as currents , a well understood situation in two dimensional conformal theories such as string theory , where the virasoro algebra is a two - dimensional version of the general schwinger commutation relations .",
    "+   + schwinger noticed in his second 1963 paper that : ( 1 ) the commutation relations are valid in curved space with some background metric ; and ( 2 ) only the first derivative of the delta function appears if the fields are limited to spin 0 , 1/2 and 1 .",
    "he explicitly proves that the third derivative of the delta function appears if spin 3/2 is included , and comments that the commutation relation is not valid when the spin 2 particle -graviton- is present . with these facts in mind",
    "i assume that the 11-dimensional energy - momentum tensor @xmath1 satisfies : @xmath2 = -i \\ { \\theta_{0 m } ) x ) + \\theta_{0 m } ( y ) \\ } \\partial_{m } \\delta ( \\vec{x } - \\vec{y } ) \\label{eq:1}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 ranges from @xmath4 to @xmath5 and @xmath6 represents the space components of the 11-dimensional vector @xmath7 .",
    "the commutation relation is valid at any point in the curved 11-dimensional space - time but i take the frame where the background metric is flat at that point @xmath7 : @xmath8 the question then arises : how can the gravitational spin 2 field be incorporated assuming equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) , which seems to be valid only for spin 0 , 1/2 and 1 ?",
    "in fact , schwinger asserts@xcite that i must add : @xmath9 to equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) when there is a spin 3/2 particle in the system .",
    "the exact two - dimensional case , the virasoro algebra , is known to contain such a higher derivative term .",
    "+   + the answer is that my theory contains vector current only , and the gravitational field is a composite field of these vectors . even in the ordinary formulation of gravity theory , one can write the metric tensor in term of the vierbein , a vector in curved space - time . in my case",
    "the relation is not merely technical but instead fundamental , in the sense that i do not assume the existence of a gravitational action written in terms of a metric tensor ; the spin 2 field is fundamentally composite .",
    "+   + all the currents correspond to generators of @xmath0 or of its extension to be defined later .",
    "more precisely , the time component of each current , when integrated in 10-dimensional space , yields the @xmath0 generator .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is expressed as the bilinear form of these currents and it is proven to satisfy the above schwinger commutation relation .",
    "more precisely , the commutation relations among currents are constructed to satisfy the schwinger commutation relation .",
    "although for convenience i write the current commutation relations at a point where the metric is taken to be locally diagonal @xmath10 , they are valid in all of curved space - time . +   +",
    "the derived equations of motion are demonstrated to emerge in a generally covariant and locally lorentz covariant way .",
    "+   + according to v. kac@xcite , there are four ways to generalize the lie group ( algebra ) to infinite set of generators : group of diffeomorphism ; current algebra ; algebra of operators in hilbert space ; and the kac - moody algebra .",
    "mathematically speaking what i will be doing here is to combine two of the infinite extensions of the lie algebra : current and kac - moody . in this sense",
    "i will be doubly extending the lie algebra .",
    "the kac - moody part extends the symmetry of the physical system to an infinite dimensional algebra and the central extension ( current algebra part ) guarantees that the theory is a quantum field theory .",

    "lengthening by 1 unit yields the over extended algebra @xmath13 , which is an affine algebra with vanishing determinant of the cartan matrix .",
    "lengthening by 2 units yields the very extended algebra @xmath14 , which is lorentzian with a negative value of the determinant of the cartan matrix .",

    "] @xmath0 is the only algebra among the above that which contains an obvious lorentz algebra @xmath15 as its subalgebra .",

    "@xmath16 contains @xmath15 as its subalgebra .",

    "the graded algebra is composed of @xmath0 and its vector representation @xmath18 . the commutation relation between the @xmath19 components and the @xmath0 generators are dictated by the fact that @xmath18 is a representation of @xmath0 together with the assumption that the commutation relations among the @xmath18 components vanish .",
