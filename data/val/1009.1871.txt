    "ngc  604 is the most luminous and massive hii region in the nearby galaxy m33 . due to its large size , great mass and proximity",
    "it has been intensively studied to gain insight into the physics of hii regions and the evolution of massive stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among others ) .",
    "of paramount importance is to determine the age of the stellar population and the different stellar types present in this region , because a deeper knowledge of this object can help us to infer properties for star - forming regions of similar types in distant galaxies .",
    "the confirmed stellar constituents of ngc  604 are ob stars , wr stars and at least one spectroscopically confirmed rsg @xcite .",
    "the different stellar types that ngc  604 harbours makes this hii region an ideal object to study its stellar population and to test stellar evolution and population synthesis models .",
    "ngc  604 is a key region to test whether the population inferred from _",
    "resolved _ stellar populations can also match the _ unresolved _ spectral features that would be used in more distant galaxies . in this paper",
    "we use this region to qualitatively check the accuracy of the binary population and spectral synthesis ( bpass ) code described in @xcite and at ` http://www.bpass.org.uk ` . here",
    "we analyze the resolved stellar population observed with deep hubble space telescope ( hst ) images and study the region as an unresolved object by using the integrated spectrum @xcite and observations of @xcite .",
    "the possible presence of rsgs in ngc  604 comes from the spectroscopic evidence of @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested the existence of a supergiant population based on hst stellar photometry , but these authors could not elaborate further these ideas since their observations where limited to the visible part of the spectrum .",
    "recently , @xcite have shown the complexity of the stellar population of this region using infrared nicmos ( near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ) observations .",
    "they found evidence of massive young stellar object candidates and suggested the existence of a rsg population within the region .",
    "here we aim to study in detail the post - main sequence objects rsgs and wr stars of ngc  604 , along with the most massive main - sequence stars in the region .",
    "we obtain the photometry for the stars within ngc  604 in the ir - nicmos filters and combine the results with the optical photometry performed by @xcite .",
    "we analyze the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of these stars from the optical to the ir wavelength range and investigate whether the rsg and wr populations have different ages .",
    "we then attempt to infer from these observations the total stellar mass and check if this is consistent with other observations such as the total h@xmath3 flux from ngc  604 .",
    "the stellar content of ngc 604 was previously studied by hunter et al .",
    "( 1996 ) using uvi photometry .",
    "these authors showed the existence of numerous massive main - sequence stars and identified a candidate wr population in their colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "they also suggest the existence of numerous stars bright enough to be blue or red supergiants , which would indicate an older sub - population in ngc  604 . due to the limitation of their data , restricted only to the visible part of the spectrum , they did not study this cool and evolved stellar population . taking advantage of the available nicmos - ir data for this region and the comparison with the optical photometry , we now investigate further this evolved population . using hunter et al.s photometry we selected stars in the central cluster of the region ( cluster a , as defined in @xcite ) with magnitudes and colours in the range of f555w - f814w@xmath51 and f555w@xmath6 - 6 and make a list of possible rsg candidates in ngc  604 .",
    "these limits ensure we are taking massive ( @xmath7 ) rsgs and therefore we can compare this population with the massive wrs detected by @xcite .",
    "ngc  604 was observed with the nicmos ( nic2 ) on board the hubble space telescope ( hst ) under the i d program 10419 ( ip : r. barb ) with the filters f110w , f160w and f205w ( similar to j , h and k filters ) .",
    "we retrieved 6 fields from the hst multimission archive at the space telescope institute ( mast ) , 5 covering the central part of ngc  604 and another covering an outside field for background subtraction .",
    "each image has a field of view of 19.2 @xmath819.2 arcsec and a pixel scale of 0.075 arcsec .",
    "the retrieved data were processed by the pipeline software calnica ( version 4.4.0 ) but further analysis needed to be performed to obtain the final mosaic images .",
    "first we , masked out the coronagraphic hole and applied the multidrizzle software package ] to create the final cosmic ray - free mosaic images .",
    "the retrieved f205w images showed some residuals due to a bad flat - field correction after being processed by calnica with the default calibration files provided in the data archive .",
    "therefore we generated a new flat - field using the f205w background images and reprocessed the images with it .",
    "the use of this flat - field clearly improved the final images for this filter .",
    "finally , the @xmath920 rows of the ccd affected by vignetting were eliminated from the images .",
    "we then created the mosaic image for the 5 fields in each filter using the world coordinate system information from the headers .",
    "the final image for the f205w filter is shown in fig.[f205wa ] . the angular resolution ( fwhm ) in the final images are 0.16 , 0.18 , 0.20arcsec for the corresponding filters f110w , f160w , f205w .",
    "we obtained the stellar magnitudes for each filter using the crowded - field fitting software daophot @xcite .",
    "we identified stars with intensities above 5 times the r.m.s .",
    "noise of each image using daofind , then aperture photometry was performed on the selected stars with a circular aperture of 3 pixel radius ( 0.23arcsec ) . a point - spread function ( psf )",
    "was fitted using bright and isolated stars in each image .",
    "then , the instrumental magnitude was derived for each identified star using the fitted psf in each image .",
    "we subtracted the identified stars off the original image and we run daofind again in the residual image to select fainter stars that were not identified in the original images . the magnitudes of these new stars were derived and included in the final photometry . in this second iteration of daophot we detected the following stars in each filter , 22 stars in f205w , 41 stars in f160w and 47 stars in f110w .",
    "however , we are only modelling stars detected in the 3 nicmos filters . with this condition",
    "the second iteration add only 5 stars to the sample in the models .",
    "none of these 5 stars are in the group classified as wr , rsg or massive ob stars , and therefore it does not have impact in the analysis nor conclusions presented in the paper .",
    "aperture corrections to a radius of 0.49arcsec were applied to the instrumental magnitudes in order to use the photometric calibrations recorded in the image headers and provided by the nicmos team ] .",
    "finally , magnitudes in the vega system for each star and each filter were then obtained .",
    "the result of the stellar photometry is shown in the top panels of fig.[mag ] .",
    "we present here the colour - colour and cmd for the identified stars in ngc  604 .",
    "the magnitude errors are a combination of the image photon noise and the uncertainties derived from the psf fitting procedure and from aperture corrections ; these are shown as a function of the magnitude for each filter in the lower panels of fig.[mag ] .",
    "the red diamonds in the top panels of fig.[mag ] correspond to the rsg candidates derived from the uvi photometry from @xcite .",
    "we identified the rsg candidates in the nicmos images using the coordinates of hunter et al. star catalogue and the f555w image from their study .",
    "only 6 candidates were within the field of view of nicmos .",
    "with exception of one rsg candidate ( number 2 in table[obsstars ] ) , for which we identified another star very close to it with magnitudes in all nicmos filters and with no counter part in the uvi photometry , the rest of the stars are clearly identified as single stars in the nicmos images .",
    "for the star 2 in table[obsstars ] we added the ir fluxes of the two identified stars in order to perform the sed fitting with all the filters available ( see section  3 ) .",
    "the identification of rsgs in extragalactic clusters is a difficult task as they could be confused with foreground galactic stars .",
    "as it has been explained in @xcite , a 40  @xmath10 rsg in m33 would have an apparent magnitude in v - band between @xmath1115.5 to @xmath1118 , depending on its effective temperature . for dwarf",
    "late - type stars the absolute v magnitude is @xmath116 ( for a k0 dwarf star ) and @xmath1112 ( for a m5 ) , taking @xmath9  600  pc as the estimated distance for these stars in the direction of m33 , the apparent v magnitudes for these stars will be between @xmath1115 and @xmath1121 @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is possible to mistake a galactic dwarf late - type star for a rsg in m33 .    a method of separating foreground stars from rsgs based on ir two - colour diagrams have been proposed by @xcite : the rsg are 0.1 - 0.2 mag redder than late - type dwarfs in j - h at comparable h - k . in fig.[fore ] we show the jhk colour - colour diagram for the stars with nicmos photometry as well as for the rsg candidates .",
    "the magnitudes in the nicmos filters have been converted into magnitudes in the jhk system following the transformation of @xcite .",
    "since the magnitude conversion procedure already adds uncertainties in the magnitude we only convert those stars with magnitudes errors lower than 0.2mag .",
    "the blue line denotes the location of the foreground late - type dwarf stars with magnitudes obtained from @xcite .",
    "clearly four of our rsg candidates stand between 0.2 to 0.6 magnitudes above the location defined by the foreground stars .",
    "the two stars that lie below the line defined by the foreground stars are s2 and s5 . these stars , as we will see later , have anomalous sed fitting ( see section  4 ) .    .",
    "the blue line shows the location of foreground late - type dwarf stars .",
    "the transformation from the nicmos filter to jhk system has been performed following the equations given in @xcite .",
    "the reddening vector corresponds to av=5mag and the @xcite extinction law . ,",
    "determining the physical parameters of stars from photometry requires a combination of stellar evolution models , model stellar atmospheres and a method to find the best fit between models and theory . in this section",
    "we outline the stellar and atmosphere models , their amalgamation and how we use the results to estimate parameters for the observed stars . to calculate the absolute magnitudes of the observed stars we take the distance of ngc  604 to be 840 kpc @xcite .",
    "we use stellar models from the cambridge stars code ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) that have been correlated with stellar atmosphere models to produce synthetic spectra and broad - band photometric colours as described in @xcite .",
    "their key feature is that there is not only a set of detailed single star models , but also an extensive set of detailed binary star models which are key to producing a realistic synthetic stellar population .",
    "we consider stellar models at the relevant metallicity for ngc  604 z=0.008 @xcite , where z is the metallicity mass fraction ( a metallicity of z=0.020 is conventionally considered solar ) .",
    "it is well known that local metallicities within disk galaxies can vary by significant factors away from the mean host metallicity .",
    "we inspected the affect of varying metallicity by running the fits with models at metallicities of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we find that our results change only slightly and allowing the metallicity to vary would only increase the uncertainty of our results .",
    "we assume a hydrogen mass fraction of @xmath14 and a helium mass fraction of @xmath15 .",
    "we calculate observable magnitudes for these stellar interior models by using a model atmosphere that best represents the appearance of the interior model at each timestep .",
    "the atmosphere models are for ob stars , wr stars and other stellar types and they are described in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , respectively .    given that stellar evolution is non - linear , and binary evolution is even more so , we do not interpolate between models with different initial parameters to determine the nature of the observed stars .",
    "instead , we compare the observed seds to the synthetic seds at every timestep of each stellar model and estimate a most likely mass , age and extinction for each observed star .",
    "this is done by calculating mean parameters from all the models that match the observed sed .",
    "we first estimate the amount of extinction required for the synthetic sed to match the observed sed .",
    "we calculate the amount of extinction required in each band to achieve an exact match between the observed and model magnitudes . using the @xcite extinction curve",
    "we convert each magnitude to the equivalent extinction in @xmath16 calculating the conversion factor @xmath17 , such that @xmath18 for the @xmath19th filter .",
    "we then calculate the mean extinction from the six filters , as follows , @xmath20 where the magnitudes predicted by a model are @xmath21 for a star with initial mass @xmath22 and age @xmath23 , the observed magnitude is @xmath24 for the @xmath25th star in the @xmath19th filter and @xmath26 is the number of filters in which the source is detected .",
    "this mean extinction is then used to correct the synthetic sed magnitudes for dust .",
    "this dust corrected model magnitudes , @xmath27 are then used to calculate the probability , @xmath28 , of a match between the observed sed and theoretical sed can be evaluated as follows : @xmath29 the errors are therefore assumed to be gaussian .",
    "@xmath30 is calculated as a combination in quadrature of the error in the photometry and an assumed error in the stellar models of 0.3 mag .",
    "this error is estimated from the magnitude difference between two stars of neighbouring masses in our grid of models",
    ". we must also take into consideration the resolution of our mass grid in the probability calculation .",
    "for example our @xmath31 model has neighbouring model masses of @xmath32 and @xmath33 . while the @xmath34 model has neighbours in the mass grid of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "therefore we add a factor , @xmath37 , to the probability to give every mass an equal probability .",
    "for the the 15 and @xmath34 examples this factor would be 1 and 15 respectively .",
    "the last factor to consider in the likelihood of a match is how quickly stars evolve .",
    "two stars might have the same apparent sed but one is evolving more rapidly than another .",
    "a star evolving slowly , such as main - sequence stars will be more probable matches to a sed that a short - lived wr stars . therefore we use the probability and the timestep of each model sed as a weight to estimate values for the parameters of each observed star .",
    "for example , the mass ( @xmath38 ) , age ( @xmath39 ) and extinction ( @xmath40 ) are obtained as follows :    @xmath41    @xmath42    @xmath43    and for each of these we are able to estimate an error from the variance , for example : @xmath44 thus for each observed sed we obtain an estimate of age , initial mass , extinction , luminosity , surface temperature , the mass ratio ( @xmath45 ) for the binary models and an error for each value .",
    "we note that we are only determining three independent parameters from each fit : luminosity , surface temperature and extinction .",
    "the age and mass are model dependent and linked to the surface temperature and luminosity .",
    "if we re - ran the analysis with different or updated models the luminosity , surface temperature and extinction would remain similar but the age and mass would change by a greater degree .    we perform our fitting process using two sets of models : single star models and binary models , then we compare the probability from the two fits to determine which is more likely .",
    "we find , except for the rsg1 , 4 and 6 , the binary models give a _",
    "match for all the stars we fit .",
    "this is likely to be due to the fact the binary models can cover more of the hertzsprung - russel diagram than the single stars therefore have a greater chance of achieving a close match to the sed . in most cases the likelihood difference between single and binary models is minimal up to only factors between 1 to 3 .",
    "the only two fits for which binaries are significantly favoured are rsg3 and wr1 . for these two stars they are 700 and 30 times more likely to be binaries respectively .",
    "the sed fits for the rsgs and wr stars assume that the stars are post - main sequence objects and therefore we only use post - main sequence models to prevent the fits being affected by main - sequence models skewing the fit .",
    "this is because in weighing by the timestep a wr star and a main - sequence ob star might have very similar seds but a star is more likely to be a main - sequence star due to its slow evolutionary timescale .    in figure [ examples ] we show examples of the location of possible sed matches on the hertzsprung - russel diagram .",
    "then figure [ sed ] compares the theoretical seds from the same fits to the observed sed . for the red supergiant the surface temperature",
    "is tightly constrained but the luminosity is less well constrained .",
    "the more luminous models require more extinction to achieve the same sed and so tend towards higher surface temperatures .",
    "however , despite this large apparent degeneracy , a low luminosity around @xmath46 is preferred because of the consideration of the timestep .",
    "while there are many possible values of the luminosity , there is only one place where the star may be observed for an appreciable period of time .",
    "therefore the fitting process gives greatest weight to this region and therefore gives the masses and ages listed in table [ obsstars ] below .",
    "in this figure we also include a similar plot with the timestep weight removed from the sed fit . without the timestep weight a better match is achieved by the more luminous and hence more massive rsg .",
    "we note that in figure [ examples ] we predict more massive rsgs than other stellar evolution models such as @xcite .",
    "however the lifetimes of these massive rsgs are very short due to their high mass - loss rate and so they are unlikely to be observed .",
    "furthermore the evolution of these massive rsgs is also uncertain and extra pulsation driven mass - loss may shorten their lifetimes further @xcite .    for the wr star",
    "the region on the surface temperature is less well constrained .",
    "this is not surprising as these stars are hot and with the filters used in the sed fitting we are only looking mainly at the rayleigh - jeans tail of the black - body spectrum so there is little constraint on the surface temperature .",
    "therefore the sed fits of the wr and main - sequence stars are intrinsically less well constrained .",
    "furthermore in figure [ sed ] the agreement between the observed and theoretical seds is slightly poorer , especially in the j and h filters .",
    "this is due to most of the wr flux being output at shorter wavelengths so the ir flux may be more greatly effected by ir emission from other nearby sources .",
    "an important check to understand the accuracy of the sed fitting process is to feed theoretical models through the sed fitting code and compare the output to known inputs .",
    "the models we use to do this where calculated separately to have initial masses between the mass grid of our stellar models .",
    "we use single star models with initial masses of 65 , 90 and 100@xmath47 .",
    "we also include a @xmath48 model to understand how stars above our maximum model mass would appear .",
    "we calculate fits to the models at three evolutionary phases , the main - sequence , rsg phase and the wr phase .",
    "the results of these fits are shown in table [ interstars ] .",
    "the fits on the rsg phase are most accurate as it is possible to achieve a better match for cooler stars .",
    "this is because the peak of black - body spectrum is observed rather than for hotter stars where only the rayleigh - jean tail of the black - body spectrum is covered .",
    "thus both the main - sequence and wr fits are less accurate .",
    "however it is possible to explain the inaccuracy of the the 65 and 80@xmath47 fits .",
    "the the @xmath49 sed was taken from towards the end of evolution for the star while the @xmath50 sed was taken from the near beginning of the track .",
    "therefore there is some degeneracy in the fitting of main - sequence stars between mass and age .",
    "in addition the more massive stars , including the @xmath48 do tend to have their masses underestimated due to this mass - age degeneracy . only with more information from the uv of the stars",
    "could we achieve a more accurate fit .",
    "an important conclusion here is that while individual fits will be uncertain by using the properties of all of the stars some of these errors will cancel out to provide a reasonable estimate of the mass and age of ngc  604 .",
    "this test indicates that the information inferred on the rsgs can be trusted more than that on the hotter stars . also that while each individual fit may not give the exact result , if we take the entire population of stars into consideration our combined uncertainty in the total age and mass of a region is significantly reduced .",
    ".results of test of sed fits for stellar models not in our standard grid .",
    "the evolutionary phases are , ms main sequence , rsg - red supergiant and wr - wolf - rayet . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ halpha ]",
    "we have found further evidence that there is a population of rsgs within ngc  604 .",
    "this older population inferred from the rsgs @xmath1myrs .",
    "the age of the more numerous young stars is @xmath0myrs , which is in agreement with previous studies @xcite .",
    "there is some uncertainty in the nature of rsg1 as it may be a very massive rsg or ysg in a short - lived phase of evolution . to accurately determine its mass a spectrum of this object",
    "is required .",
    "however its deep position in ngc  604 surrounded by many o and wr stars indicates that it may well be a very massive rsg .",
    "the rsgs have larger extinctions than the other stars in ngc  604 .",
    "this is in agreement with them producing large amounts of dust to obtain greater intrinsic extinction @xcite .",
    "the one wnl wr star also has a higher extinction than expected from the study of @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with the evolutionary scenario that rsgs lose their hydrogen envelopes and become wr stars .",
    "the two stars labeled in table[obsstars ] as s2 ? and s5 ? may be rsgs in the very late phases of losing their hydrogen envelopes due to their very high inferred extinction",
    ". however they are more likely to be foreground stars .",
    "we also find that the wr spectral features heii and the blue bump and the o - star civ p - cygni profile of the composite spectrum of the region agree in general with the results from the resolved stellar population .",
    "the ob main - sequence stars appear to be younger than the wr stars .",
    "however , a direct comparison is difficult as the uv and optical spectra of the region do not cover the entire region and the duration of the star - formation burst is similar to the age of the cluster and therefore difficult to model .    by using the estimated age of the stellar population we are able to predict the h@xmath3 flux from the massive stars and compare this to the flux observed for ngc  604 .",
    "we find the two agree in magnitude but that @xmath4 percent of the ionizing flux may be escaping from the region .",
    "the greatest uncertainty in calculating the h@xmath3 flux , and therefore the amount of leakage , is the age of the stellar population .",
    "thus , we are unable to completely rule out that there are no absolute leakage of ionizing photons . however , since leakage has been studied to be a common property of luminous hii regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is more likely that leakage is occurring .",
    "future study of the main - sequence population using hst / acs data will enable tighter constraints to be placed upon the predicted ionizing flux escaping from ngc  604 ( laporte et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "the evidence supporting the existence of rsgs in ngc  604 and their relation to the most recently formed stars is important because recent and future cutting - edge telescopes operate at these longer wavelengths ( e.g. spitzer , herschel , jwst and the e - elt ) .",
    "soon all premier observatories will operate predominantly at ir wavelengths and therefore modelling and observation efforts must act now to address this observational shift . there are known problems with modelling near - ir emission @xcite : typically it is found that for some star clusters ages derived from near - ir observations do not agree with those estimated from optical ones .",
    "the rsgs within ngc  604 are a key element required to study distance hii regions in the ir .",
    "the relative contributions of older rsgs and younger stars must be evaluated .",
    "key to breaking any degeneracy will be the use of spectra and spectral lines such as the ir lines of rsgs and wolf - rayet stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this implies that the study of distant hii regions at ir wavelengths will be challenging unless the contribution of such contaminants can be fully understood .",

    "<S> we study the post - main sequence stars in ngc  604 , the most luminous hii region in m33 . </S>",
    "<S> previously , a number of wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars and one red supergiant ( rsg ) have been discovered . </S>",
    "<S> based on broadband photometry of the region , we present evidence that is consistent with the presence of this rsg and with three more rsg candidates . </S>",
    "<S> using sed fitting based on hst uvijhk photometry we estimate the ages of the wr stars and rsgs finding that the two populations are from distinct formation episodes with ages @xmath0myrs and @xmath1myrs , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the rsgs have greater extinctions towards their line of sight than the wr stars consistent with the rsgs producing large amount of dust . using the wr and rsg populations and similar sed fits to the most massive o stars we estimate that the total stellar mass is @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we find a large discrepancy between the expected h@xmath3 flux from such a massive cluster and that one observed . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that @xmath4 percent of the ionizing photons produced by massive stars in ngc  604 is leaking from this hii region . </S>",
    "<S> we also suggest that the implications of an old rsg population mean that if ngc  604 was more distant and only observed in the infrared ( ir ) it would be difficult to study the youngest burst of star formation due to the contamination of rsgs .    </S>",
