    "therefore , the relation between uniform magnetic and strain - induced pseudomagnetic fields , following from the statistical description of the evolution of energy levels in weak fields by means of additive random - matrix models , appears to be consistent with the corresponding relation arising from transport properties in strong fields .",

    ", strain fields associated with moderate in - plain deformations drive a highly - symmetric nanosystem into chaotic regime .",
    "moreover , our results show , that the system symmetry class is related to the particular arrangement the deformation : in a  generic case of the deformation breaking all geometric symmetries the unitary symmetry class is observed , as the strain field also breaks the effective ( symplectic ) time reversal symmetry ( strs ) in a  single valley . to the contrary , if a  single mirror symmetry is preserved , we have only the false strs breaking leading to the orthogonal symmetry class .",
    "( such a  physical situation has no analogue in graphene nanoflakes with substrate - induced disorder @xcite or irregular edges @xcite , where all geometric symmetries are naturally broken . )",
    "it is worth to stress , that although particular strain arrangements studied here are different from those in existing experiments @xcite , the nature of the results allows one to expect , that the system symmetry class remains unitary ( orthogonal ) for an arbitrary strain arrangement leading to the true ( false ) strs breaking , providing the deformations are sufficiently small that the effective dirac theory for low - energy excitations can be applied .    in both cases of the unitary and the orthogonal symmetry classes , spectral statistics obtained numerically",
    "follow those of the relevant ensembles of random matrices ( gue or goe ) , with the twofold valley degeneracy of each energy level . when the real magnetic and strain fields are applied simultaneously , the valley degeneracy no longer applies , and our system displays spectral fluctuations following two statistically - independent gues ( or goes ) , one per each valley .    the evolution of spectral statistics with weak strain fields , exhibiting the transition to quantum chaos , is rationalized using additive random - matrix models .",
    "the functional relations between the best - fitted model parameters and the deformation strength allow one to compare the effects of strain fields with the effects of real magnetic fields in a  quantitative manner .",
    "the resulting numerical relation between uniform magnetic and strain - induced pseudomagnetic fields stays in agreement with the similar relation , earlier obtained for strong fields leading to the appearance of landau quantization ( see the second paper of ref .",
