    "accreting black holes ( bh ) remain among the most fascinating objects being studied since the very beginning of the x - ray era .",
    "the observed x - ray radiation is variable on a wide range of timescales , displaying dramatic changes in spectral shape between the power law dominated hard state and the quasi - thermal soft state over timescales of weeks @xcite .",
    "strong variability is also seen on far shorter ( down to @xmath010  ms ) timescales . among the most prominent features commonly observed in the power spectral density ( psd ) of bh binaries",
    "are low - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) @xcite , with a characteristic frequency which evolves from @xmath00.110  hz at the spectral transitions from the hard to soft state .",
    "a growing number of low - mass x - ray binaries have also been found to exhibit similar qpos in the optical and uv psds @xcite .",
    "the optical , uv and x - ray qpos in xte  j1118 + 480 have been observed to share a common ( within uncertainties ) characteristic frequency whilst evolving over nearly two months of observations @xcite . in the x - rays ,",
    "the qpo frequency is correlated with the low - frequency break of the broadband noise @xcite .",
    "hints of such a correlation in the optical can also be found in the existing data @xcite , however the significance is too low to make any conclusive statements .",
    "it is therefore suggestive that the x - ray and optical qpos are formed by a common mechanism which is somehow related to the production of aperiodic variability ( broadband noise ) .",
    "however , there is no consensus in the literature as to the origin of the x - ray qpo and so far no optical qpo mechanism has been suggested .",
    "proposed x - ray qpo mechanisms are generally based either on the misalignment of the bh and binary system spins ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or on oscillation modes of the accretion flow itself ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "many of them , however , discuss the qpo production separately and do not consider its relation to the aperiodic x - ray variability .",
    "probably the most promising qpo model to date was proposed in @xcite , where the oscillations arise from the precession of orbits around the bh due to misalignment of the bh and orbital spins , known as lense - thirring precession .",
    "similar models proposed earlier considered the precession of a test mass @xcite , leading to a strong dependence of the predicted qpo frequency on bh spin , inconsistent with the observations . the model of @xcite considers the precession of the entire hot flow , which leads to a much weaker spin dependence . we note that the precession of the entire flow as a solid body can only be possible in the case of a hot geometrically thick accretion flow @xcite , while a cold thin disk would produce a steady warp in the plane perpendicular to the bh spin @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that the physical parameters of the hot flow picked to match the observed qpo frequency are also consistent with those required to produce the characteristic frequencies of the broad band noise @xcite , thus a global connection between the qpo and aperiodic variability was established .",
    "this variability model ultimately requires a geometry where the cold @xcite accretion disk is truncated at some radius and the bh vicinity is occupied by some type of the hot accretion flow ( _ the truncated disk model _ ; @xcite ) .",
    "the power law component of the x - ray spectrum can be understood in this geometry as compton up - scattering of cold seed photons by hot electrons in the flow .",
    "the seed photons are often assumed to be provided by the disk , however in the hard state when the truncation radius is large ( @xmath030@xmath1 where @xmath2 is the schwarzschild radius ) , the luminosity of disk photons incident on the flow is insufficient to reproduce the observed spectra and an additional source of seed photons is required .",
    "this can be provided by synchrotron radiation in the flow .",
    "compton up - scattering of the resulting internally produced seed photons ( the synchrotron self - compton mechanism ) can successfully reproduce the observed hard state spectra @xcite .",
    "let us note that an array of accretion geometries can explain the observed spectra but the lense - thirring qpo model is compatible only with the truncated disk model considered here .",
    "lately , it was shown that the hot flow synchrotron emission can contribute to the optical and even ir ( oir ) wavelengths @xcite , thus these wavelengths are tightly connected to the x - ray component .",
    "hence , the spectral model also predicts the connection between the oir and the x - ray aperiodic variability .",
    "however , simultaneous analysis of light - curves in these wavelengths @xcite has revealed a complicated connection between them , which can be understood if one considers several components contributing to the optical @xcite , namely the hot accretion flow and the reprocessed radiation",
    ". additionally , the jet optically thin synchrotron emission can also be significant ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these three components presumably can be responsible for the oir qpos .",
    "in section  [ sect : models_setup ] we develop a quantitative model for the low - frequency oir and x - ray qpos , which are produced by lense - thirring precession of a hot accretion flow .",
    "we make predictions for the oir qpo profiles and compare them to those expected in the x - rays .",
    "we then calculate the phase - lags and harmonic content expected from this model . in section  [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss the limitations of the model and possible improvements and compare the model predictions with the data .",
    "we summarize our findings in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in this section , we outline our assumptions . we consider a hot accretion flow extending from some inner radius to the truncation radius of the cold outer disk and a spin axis misaligned with that of the bh by some angle @xmath3 . in the kerr metric , test",
    "particle orbits out of the plane of bh rotation undergo lense  thirring precession due to the dragging of inertial frames , with a frequency @xmath4 . in the case of a hot accretion flow",
    ", this differential precession creates a warp which propagates through the flow on a time scale shorter than the precession period .",
    "this can cause the entire flow to precess as a solid body at a frequency given by a surface density weighted average of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "if the flow is assumed to extend from the disk truncation radius to the inner most stable circular orbit , the dependence of the precession frequency on bh spin is too strong and the maximum precession frequency is too high to be consistent with observations . in order to put the lense  thirring frequencies into the observed qpo range , from @xmath00.03  hz @xcite up to @xmath013  hz @xcite , one needs to account for the torque created by frame dragging , which truncates the inner flow at a fairly large ( inner ) radius ( @xmath6 , see equation  22 of @xcite , where @xmath7 should be taken ) and effectively cancels out much of the spin dependence of precession @xcite .",
    "this effect has since been seen in simulations @xcite .",
    "we reproduce the dependence of the qpo frequency on the outer radius of the hot flow in figure  [ fig : qpo_freq ] .",
    "since we aim to model the hard state , we assume a fairly large truncation radius of @xmath8 , leading to a predicted precession frequency consistent with the observed qpo frequency in this state ( @xmath9  hz ) .",
    "when @xmath10 decreases ( corresponding to transition to the hard - intermediate state ) , @xmath11 grows up to 520 hz .    although the condition on the flow height - to - radius ratio , @xmath12 , for the fast propagation of warps which allows solid body precession is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the dimensionless viscosity parameter @xcite , @xmath12 significantly less than unity is likely @xcite .",
    "thus , we approximate the flow as a flat disk . this approximation is satisfactory for systems with a low enough inclination for the flow never to be seen edge - on at any point in the precession cycle .",
    "we illustrate in our plots the regions of parameter space where this condition is not met . in order to calculate the emitted flux ,",
    "we must make an assumption about the radial dependence of energy dissipation per unit area in the flow .",
    "we assume the standard profile for a thin disk @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the hot flow inner radius , which we assume to be equal 3@xmath1 ( for parameters in figure  [ fig : qpo_freq ] it takes the values @xmath025@xmath1 ) .",
    "the profile is not strictly appropriate for a hot flow in general relativity @xcite , but is fine for illustration in the absence of a standard equivalent for hot flows .",
    "the details of the energy dissipation profile do not play an important role . for calculations of the angular dependence of the emergent radiation we take into account relativistic effects using the schwarzschild metric ( see sect .  [",
    "sect : profiles ] ) .",
    "since we are considering lense - thirring precession , this is obviously only an approximation to the more appropriate kerr metric .",
    "however , the schwarzschild metric provides a very good approximation at distances more than @xmath17 from the bh .",
    "we take into account only direct images , because the higher - order images are much weaker .",
    "the reason is that the hot flow we consider has optical depth of the order of unity , thus most of the photons initially emitted away from the observer would be blocked by the flow itself ( or by the outer cold disk ) .",
    "the only possibility for those photons to reach the observer is to go through the rather small gap between the inner edge of the hot flow ( @xmath18 ) and the black hole .",
    "in addition , photons coming in the higher - order images are generally emitted at grazing angles to the flow surface and therefore their strength is diminished by the corresponding cosine factor . in order to estimate the accuracy of the described approach , we compared fluxes obtained using our light tracing procedure with those obtained using the geokerr code in kerr geometry ( @xcite ; adam ingram et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "including all higher - order images , but accounting for obscuration by the hot flow and the outer cold disk .",
    "for the parameters considered in this work , we find our results to be accurate within a few per cent for any spin value up to @xmath19 , and for more realistic spins of @xmath20 the difference is below 1% .",
    "figure  [ fig : geometry_flow ] shows the geometry we consider for the precessing hot accretion flow .",
    "we define the coordinate system @xmath21 tied to the binary orbital plane and the system @xmath22 , associated with the bh spin .",
    "the @xmath23-axis is perpendicular to the binary orbital plane , @xmath24 is aligned with the bh spin and @xmath3 is the angle between them .",
    "the @xmath25-axis is defined by the intersection of the orbital plane and the plane formed by the @xmath23 and @xmath24 axes ( i.e. the projection of the @xmath24-axis onto the @xmath26-axis is always zero ) .",
    "finally , the @xmath27-axis also belongs to the plane formed by vectors @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and forms angle @xmath3 with the @xmath25-axis ( i.e. @xmath28 ) .",
    "the position of the observer is described by the vector @xmath29 which , in @xmath21 coordinates , is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the binary inclination and @xmath32 is the azimuth of the observer measured from the @xmath25-axis .",
    "the instantaneous normal to the hot flow is denoted by @xmath33 .",
    "it precesses around the bh spin axis ( @xmath24 ) with the precession angle @xmath34 measured from the @xmath27-axis .",
    "thus @xmath33 aligns with the @xmath23-axis when @xmath35 and has a maximal misalignment of @xmath36 when @xmath37 .",
    "it is given , in @xmath22 coordinates , by @xmath38 .",
    "note , we use a hat to denote unit vectors throughout .",
    "we are interested in the orientation of the hot flow surface relative to the observer , namely the scalar product @xmath39 . in order to calculate it ,",
    "we write @xmath33 in @xmath21 coordinates by rotating the @xmath22 coordinate system counter - clockwise by angle @xmath3 around the @xmath40-axis to get @xmath41 thus , the equation for @xmath42 is @xmath43      we consider a simplified problem with a precessing flat disk ( slab ) .",
    "the specific flux observed far from the bh from a ring of thickness @xmath44 at radius @xmath45 in the direction that makes an angle @xmath46 to the surface normal can be expressed as @xmath47 here , @xmath48 is the distance to the observer , @xmath49 is the surface flux per energy interval at a given radius and the factor @xmath50 accounts for the angular dependence of the observed flux .",
    "the latter factor depends on the spectral slope of the radiation .",
    "the flux observed from the whole hot flow is then @xmath51 where we introduced the radially averaged angular factor : @xmath52    in general , the specific intensity emerging from a surface element depends on the zenith angle @xmath53 ( primed are quantities in the comoving frame ) .",
    "we consider here two cases for the emission pattern from the flow surface :    1 .",
    "x - ray emission from accreting bhs is produced by comptonization in an optically translucent flow with thomson optical depth @xmath54 . in this case , the angular dependence of the specific intensity can approximately be described by @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 ( for exact solutions see @xcite ) .",
    "optical synchrotron radiation is produced in the outer parts of the flow , in a partially self - absorbed regime .",
    "the dominant contribution to the observed flux comes from those parts , which have an optical depth for synchrotron self - absorption @xmath57 . assuming a tangled magnetic field and homogeneous source function throughout the vertical extent of the flow",
    ", the intensity of radiation can be expressed as @xmath58    we assume that the emergent spectrum from all surface elements is a power law with photon index @xmath59 for the x - rays and @xmath60 for the optical emission .",
    "this allows us to approximate the energy dissipation profile as @xmath61 . to compute the factor @xmath50 we take into account gravitational redshift , doppler effect , relativistic aberration , time dilation and light bending in the schwarzschild metric following techniques presented by @xcite and @xcite",
    "figure  [ fig : flux_theta ] shows the resulting angular flux dependence with x - rays and optical represented by black dotted and blue dashed lines , respectively .",
    "we plot the function @xmath50 for narrow rings at @xmath62 100 , 30 , 10 , 5 and 3 from top to bottom .",
    "we also show ( by red solid line ) the angular distribution of the flux from the accretion flow spread from 3 to 30@xmath1 , @xmath63 , emitting the x - rays according to the standard profile given by equation  ( [ eq : ss73_profile ] ) . at large radii @xmath64 ,",
    "the relativistic effects are negligible resulting in the angular dependence @xmath65 .      as a first step ,",
    "we take the x - ray and optical emission to originate from narrow rings with @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively , and compute corresponding qpo waveforms .",
    "we set @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the profiles @xmath50 ( with @xmath46 given by equation  ( [ eq : cos_theta ] ) ) are shown in figure  [ fig : profiles ] for four different observer azimuths : @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "again , the black dotted lines are x - rays and the blue dashed line represents the optical . clearly the phase difference between optical and x - ray profiles depends on the observer s azimuth and inclination : for @xmath74 and large @xmath32 the two light - curves are in phase , while for low @xmath32 they are @xmath73 out of phase .",
    "this is because the range of @xmath42 covered as the precession angle @xmath34 unwinds from @xmath75 to @xmath76 depends on the chosen set of parameters ( @xmath3 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) .",
    "the range of @xmath42 for every case is shown in figure  [ fig : profiles ] with a green dash - dotted line . for small @xmath42 ( panels c and d ) ,",
    "both optical and x - ray observed fluxes are increasing functions of @xmath42 ( see figure  [ fig : flux_theta ] ) , while for large @xmath42 ( panels a and b ) optical flux is a growing and x - ray flux is a decreasing function of @xmath42 .",
    "the later is reflected in the anti - correlation of the two light - curves .    for inclinations @xmath77 ,",
    "eclipses are possible when the observer is situated at the opposite side from the bh spin projection on the orbital plane , i.e. at @xmath78 . in such a situation ,",
    "the harmonic content is dramatically increased and the x - ray and optical light curves are always in phase , as here @xmath79 ( thus both fluxes have monotonic dependence on @xmath42 , see figure  [ fig : flux_theta ] ) .",
    "however , we need to keep in mind that at such large inclinations the central source might be blocked completely by the outer rim of the cold disk .",
    "we note that the amplitude of the optical qpo for every @xmath32 is higher than in the x - rays .",
    "again , the behavior can be understood from figure  [ fig : flux_theta ] : the dependence of the optical flux ( blue dashed line at @xmath80 ) on @xmath42 is much stronger than that in the x - rays ( black dotted line at @xmath81 ) .",
    "this occurs both due to the different emission pattern and because the relativistic effects are stronger at smaller @xmath45 ( due to stronger gravitational curvature and faster keplerian motion ) .    for the cases ( b)(d ) , the x - ray flux maximum",
    "is reached not when @xmath42 is maximal , i.e. when the flow is mostly face - on , but when it is inclined at a larger angle ( see figure  [ fig : flux_theta ] ) .",
    "this leads to the double - peak structures in the x - ray profiles , unlike in the optical ( optical flux reaches maximum only at maximal @xmath42 , i.e. when the flow is mostly face - on ) .",
    "this gives the x - ray qpo profiles a stronger harmonic content than the optical .",
    "the x - ray light curves expected from the whole hot flow occupying the region 330@xmath1 can be computed from the factor @xmath63 ( with @xmath46 given by equation  ( [ eq : cos_theta ] ) ) .",
    "they are shown by red solid lines in figure  [ fig : profiles ] .",
    "we see that their behavior is very similar to that corresponding to a narrow ring at @xmath81 .",
    "this is due to the similarities in the angular dependence of the fluxes ( see figure  [ fig : flux_theta ] , solid line and dotted line corresponding to @xmath81 ) .",
    "the emission pattern from a ring at @xmath82 would be nearly identical to that of the whole extended flow , and so assuming all of the flux to come from close to this radius provides a good approximation .",
    "we analyze the harmonic content of our light curves by directly computing fourier coefficients .",
    "we show the fractional root - mean - square ( rms ) variability amplitudes of the first harmonic ( referred to below as the fundamental ) and the second harmonic ( hereafter referred to as the harmonic ) as the contour plots at the plane observer azimuth @xmath32  observer inclination @xmath31 ( figure  [ fig : rms ] ) .",
    "the azimuthal angle spans the interval from 0 to 180 , because the results depend on @xmath83 only .",
    "the x - rays are assumed to be coming from the whole flow extending from @xmath84 to @xmath80 with a standard emissivity profile given by equation ( [ eq : ss73_profile ] ) .",
    "the x - ray rms is shown by red lines .",
    "the optical again is assumed coming from @xmath80 and its rms is shown by blue lines .",
    "behavior of the x - ray and optical fundamental is shown in figures  [ fig : rms](a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "the optical rms increases monotonically with both @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the x - ray rms drops to zero at inclinations between 45and 65 , depending on @xmath32 , where the light curve shows a double bump structure ( thus , the harmonic here is non - zero ) . at higher inclinations rms increases again . at high inclinations and large",
    "@xmath32 in the shaded region , self - eclipses of the disk become possible , causing dramatic increase of rms .",
    "the dot - dashed black line separates the regions , where the phase difference between the optical / x - ray fundamental qpos shifts from 0 to @xmath85 .",
    "also the amplitude of the x - ray fundamental turns zero along this line .",
    "figures  [ fig : rms](c ) and ( d ) present the contour plot of the harmonic rms for x - rays and optical , respectively . here",
    "the rms is monotonically growing with both @xmath31 and @xmath32 up to rather large @xmath86 ( i.e. @xmath87 ) . at large inclinations",
    "eclipses become possible ( see right panels of figure  [ fig : profiles ] ) . in that case , both rms show very erratic behavior and depend strongly on @xmath31 , first rapidly rising and then dropping to nearly zero ( at somewhat different places of the plane shown by black dashed lines ) , but here the higher harmonics are strong .",
    "this is easily seen in figures  [ fig : rms](e)(g ) which show the rms behavior as a function of @xmath31 for fixed @xmath32 .",
    "we see that , for the chosen parameters , the optical fundamental is stronger than the x - ray fundamental for all observer azimuths whereas the x - ray harmonic is nearly always stronger than the optical harmonic . without eclipses ,",
    "the optical harmonic is typically ten times weaker than the fundamental , while the x - ray harmonic can be even stronger than the corresponding fundamental . for better vizualization",
    "we also plot a cross - section of these contour plots in figures  [ fig : rms](h ) and ( i ) for two representative inclinations @xmath74 and @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "the first is the mean possible inclination of an arbitrary observer , while the second is chosen to show the role of eclipses .",
    "here we additionally show the case of the x - rays from a narrow ring at @xmath81 by black lines . in panel",
    "( h ) , we clearly see a drop of the fundamental x - ray rms at @xmath89100 and in panel ( i ) a rapid grow of rms when eclipses become possible at @xmath90 .",
    "our results show that the x - ray light - curves have strong harmonics , while optical harmonics are weaker for most of sets ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) .",
    "indeed , harmonics are often found in the x - ray psds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but no optical harmonics have been reported so far .",
    "this can also be seen in the ( quasi- ) simultaneous data of @xcite , where both optical and x - ray psds show a qpo at @xmath91  hz , two harmonics @xmath92  hz and @xmath93  hz are seen in the x - ray , but not in the optical psd .",
    "our simulations suggest that the rms amplitudes of the fundamental harmonic in the optical are expected to be larger .",
    "unfortunately , the data with both x - ray and optical qpos detected are not strictly simultaneous , thus the psds are plotted in arbitrary units @xcite . in the available simultaneous data of swift j1753.50127 ,",
    "the optical qpo is present with rms=411% , while the upper limit on the x - ray qpo rms at the same frequency is 3% @xcite . in gx 3394 situation",
    "is similar , the optical qpo is present at rms=3% , while the upper limit on the x - ray qpo rms at the same frequency is 7.5% @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with our model which predicts that the x - ray qpo is there , just at a low rms .",
    "on the other hand , we , of course , can not rule out there being no qpo at all . in order to check the presence of the x - ray qpo in the data ( which is related to the optical qpo ) ,",
    "one may search for modulations at the corresponding frequency in the cross - correlation function .",
    "these oscillations are indeed present in the 2007 data on swift  j1753.50127 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* veledina et al . in prep . ) and hints of them can also be seen in the gx  3394 data @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : qpo_freq ] we reproduced the range of possible qpo frequencies ( the same for optical and x - rays ) as a function of the hot flow outer radius . since the dependence on parameters is not too strong , it is feasible to determine @xmath10 for a given @xmath11 .",
    "in realistic situation , @xmath10 fluctuates together with the mass accretion rate , leading to a change of the qpo frequency and broadening of the qpo features in the psd .",
    "we note that the given frequencies were computed under the assumption of the rotation of the hot flow as a solid body , which breaks down for a large hot flow , limiting the outer radii , where the qpos can be observed .",
    "the lowest qpo frequencies @xmath91  hz ( optical ) and @xmath00.03  hz ( x - rays ) were observed in the hard state .",
    "according to figure  [ fig : qpo_freq ] , we find the hot flow outer radius can be @xmath0100  @xmath1 , and even larger for @xmath940.4 or spin @xmath950.5 . in this case , the optical and ir wavelengths are dominated by the radiation of the translucent parts of the hot flow ( see e.g. , @xcite , fig .  3 : optical wavelengths are dominated by the radiation coming from @xmath030  @xmath1 ) .    during the state transition , with the rise of the mass accretion rate ,",
    "the outer shells of the hot flow are gradually replaced by the cold accretion disk @xcite . as the outer radius of the hot flow decreases , an increase of the qpo frequency occurs .",
    "this is seen in the data as correlated changes in the spectral slope and qpo frequency ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and expected in the precession model of @xcite and @xcite . simultaneously , a sharp drop of the ir radiation is expected , with fluxes at longer wavelengths dropping just before those at shorter wavelengths . while the cold accretion disk is sufficiently far away ,",
    "the x - ray spectrum does not change significantly , as the amount of cold disk photons are not enough to make it softer .",
    "the noticeable x - ray spectral transition starts when the cold disk is rather close to the bh , at radii about 10  @xmath1 ( fig .  5 of * ?",
    "for such a small hot flow , ir wavelengths belong to the optically thick ( self - absorbed ) part of the spectrum , which is very hard , with spectral index up to @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "thus , in the hard - intermediate state we expect to see the qpo feature with frequencies @xmath981  hz in the near - ir , but not in the mid - ir or longer wavelengths , which would likely be very faint , probably , too faint to be detectable .",
    "the optical / x - ray phase lags in both translucent and opaque cases are expected to be the same ( see below ) , either 0 or @xmath85 depending on the observer azimuthal angle and inclination .",
    "maximum optical / near - ir qpo frequency in our model is the same as in the x - rays @xmath010  hz ( for a 10@xmath99 bh ) .",
    "we discussed in detail the oir qpos produced only by the hot accretion flow , however these presumably may originate from other components , such as reprocessed x - ray radiation ( for low qpo frequencies ) and the jet ( if it is entirely driven by the accretion flow ) .",
    "it is likely that the component giving major contribution to the observed flux also produces the qpos , because of their rather large rms .",
    "simultaneous data of swift  j1753.50127 at late stages of the outburst ( @xcite , fig .",
    "6 , see also @xcite , fig .",
    "5 ) suggest that the optical lies on the continuation of the x - ray power - law , as expected in the hot flow scenario @xcite .",
    "some irradiation may also play a role ( as supported by the cross - correlation studies of @xcite during the outburst peak ) , but the jet is very faint in this object .",
    "thus the optical qpos are likely produced by the hot flow .",
    "it is therefore suggestive that the hot flow scenario also works in other objects displaying qpos , such as xte  j1118 + 480 and gx  3394 .",
    "because we aimed to have as few parameters as possible , the model we consider is rather simplified . in a more realistic problem , a number of additional effects could also be accounted for , namely : the wavelength dependence of the optical profiles , occultations of the hot flow by the cold accretion disk , effects of the hot flow geometry , e.g. its finite and radius - dependent thickness , presence of the large - scale magnetic field , presence of other spectral components in the optical , such as the reprocessed emission and the jet .",
    "let us now consider possible consequences of these effects .    1 .",
    "the optical qpo profiles were calculated assuming these wavelengths belong to the partially self - absorbed regime . however",
    ", if the flow is small ( e.g. , @xmath100 ) , the optical ( and even more certainly the ir ) is likely to be in the self - absorbed part of the spectrum ( @xmath101 ) . in this case , the intensity of escaping radiation is isotropic and the flux depends only on the surface area of the flow projected to the line of sight modified by relativistic effects .",
    "the qpo waveforms in this case are not much different from the previously considered case of emission at the self - absorption frequency , but the rms of the fundamental is somewhat larger and the harmonic is weaker .",
    "2 .   for calculations of the x - ray qpo profiles",
    ", we adopted a simple prescription for the angular dependence of the specific intensity from the hot flow given by equation ( [ eq : compton_pattern ] ) .",
    "obviously , it is only an approximation to the real angular dependence that should be computed using the full compton scattering kernel ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the intensity @xmath102 in reality should depend on the photon energy as well as on @xmath103 and temperature , with both being functions of the accretion rate and the distance from the bh .",
    "we do not expect that the general topology of the solution will change , but the details ( e.g. the position of the line separating the phase lag @xmath104 and @xmath85 in figure  [ fig : rms ] ) might differ .",
    "the result will also depend on the x - ray energy band .",
    "hard state bhbs are known to have radio jets @xcite .",
    "theoretical models for the jet launching require the presence of the large scale magnetic field . in that case , the synchrotron emissivity within the hot flow is no longer isotropic , but depends on the pitch angle @xmath14 to the magnetic field as @xmath105 .",
    "this would lead to a different angular dependence of the escaping intensity . for a poloidal field ,",
    "radiation would be more beamed along the hot flow surface leading to a luminosity angular dependence similar to that in the x - rays . in this case ,",
    "the optical waveforms are expected to have more harmonic content .",
    "possible occultations of the hot flow by coverage of the inner parts of the cold accretion disk or by its flared outer parts may occur .",
    "these would lead to the asymmetry of the optical ( and x - ray ) qpo profiles and absence of the secondary peak in the x - ray profiles . similarly to the considered occultations at high inclinations , this would lead to an increase of the fundamental rms and harmonic content .",
    "additionally , the optical and x - ray profiles will not be anymore in phase ( or in anti phase ) . 5 .",
    "we considered a simple case with a flat precessing disk , but in reality , the hot flow has finite thickness .",
    "this does not have much effect on the profiles for low inclinations .",
    "self - eclipses of the hot flow will appear at somewhat lower inclinations , but , on the other hand , emission from the outer side of the hot flow will be visible and the eclipses will not be so deep .",
    "thus , the increase in rms will not be so significant and the harmonic content will be somewhat lower .",
    "6 .   when estimating the rms we assumed that the optical emission is produced entirely by the hot flow .",
    "in reality , additionally there is reprocessed emission from the outer disk that might be dominant at longer wavelengths as well as possibly optically thin , soft emission from the radio jet that might contribute to the emission at shorter wavelengths .",
    "these components not only contribute to the flux diluting the rms from the hot flow , but also in principle can be variable at the qpo frequency .",
    "as reprocessing occurs in the outer part of the accretion disk , it acts as a low - pass filter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , reducing signal at high frequencies .",
    "thus the reprocessing is not expected to vary at relatively high qpo frequencies .",
    "whether the jet can produce qpos at the same frequency as the inner hot flow precesses is not clear .",
    "the lense  thirring effect generally can not cause the jet precession unless the jet is driven entirely by the accretion flow @xcite .",
    "hence , the presence of several components in the spectrum typically will reduce the rms amplitude of the optical qpo by a factor @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the ratio of the observed fluxes at a given energy produced by the jet and reprocessing to that of the hot flow .",
    "a number of bh binaries have recently been found to show qpo features in their optical psds .",
    "recently , it has been shown that similar qpos in the x - rays are well explained by lense - thirring precession of the hot accretion flow . here",
    "we propose that oir qpos originate from the same process , namely that the outer parts of the precessing hot flow are radiating in the optical ( by non - thermal synchrotron ) , producing qpos at frequencies matching those in the x - rays .",
    "we calculate the possible oir profiles and make predictions for the phase difference with the x - rays",
    ". the phase shift can be either 0 ( at high inclinations ) or @xmath85 ( at low inclinations ) , with the boundary between these case depending on the azimuthal angle of the observer .",
    "we also investigate the harmonic content and show dependence of the rms on parameters for two first harmonics . here",
    "we show that the x - ray qpos should have smaller rms at the fundamental frequency than the oir qpos . on the other hand",
    ", the x - ray qpos should have much stronger harmonic .",
    "we discuss possible qpo frequencies and their connection to the broadband spectral properties . at the hard - to - soft state transition",
    "we expect the oir qpo frequency to increase , always being the same as in the x - rays , up to @xmath010  hz in the hard - intermediate state .",
    "the broadband spectrum is expected to change in such a way that the emission at longer wavelengths drops before the subsequent drop at shorter wavelengths ( infrared , optical ) .",
    "after that the x - ray transition occurs . in the hard state ,",
    "the qpo feature is sometimes absent ( not significant ) in the x - ray psd , but detected in the optical .",
    "their common origin can be established through the cross - correlation analysis , where the oscillations at corresponding frequency can be present . using future x - ray missions with high time - resolution capability , such as _ loft _ , together with the corresponding high time - resolution instruments in the optical , we will be able to confirm or discard this ."
