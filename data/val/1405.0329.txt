    "a graph is a _ circular - arc graph _ if its vertices can be assigned to arcs on a circle such that two vertices are adjacent if and only if their corresponding arcs intersect . such a set of arcs is called a _ circular - arc model _ of this graph .",
    "if there is some point on the circle that is not covered by any arc in the model , then the graph is an _ interval graph _ , and it can also be represented by a set of intervals on the real line , which is called an _",
    "interval model_. circular - arc graphs and interval graphs are two of the most famous intersection graph classes , and both have been studied intensively for decades .",
    "however , in contrast to interval graphs , our understanding of circular - arc graphs is far limited , and to date some fundamental problem remains unsolved .",
    "@xmath0 @xmath0 @xmath0    one fundamental combinatorial problem on a graph class is its characterization by forbidden induced subgraphs . for example ,",
    "lekkerkerker and boland @xcite showed in 1962 that a graph is an interval graph if and only if it contains neither a hole ( i.e. , a induced cycle of length at least four ) nor any graph in fig .  [ fig : at ] as an induced subgraph . recall that holes are",
    "the forbidden induced subgraphs of _ chordal graphs _",
    ", which are the intersection of subtrees of a tree . in contrast , since it was first asked by hadwiger et al .",
    "@xcite in 1964 , all efforts attempting to characterize circular - arc graphs by forbidden induced subgraphs have succeeded only partially .",
    "tucker made the most significant contribution to the study of the class of circular - arc graphs and its subclasses , which includes the forbidden induced subgraph characterizations of both unit circular - arc graphs ( i.e. , a graph with a circular - arc model where every arc has the same length ) and proper circular - arc graphs ( i.e. , a graph with a circular - arc model where no arc properly contains another ) @xcite ; we will see more later . there is a similar line of research for other proper subclasses of circular - arc graphs , which aims at determining their forbidden induced subgraphs or some other kinds of obstructions ; for this we refer to the surveys of lin and soulignac @xcite and durn et al .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "one fundamental algorithmic problem on a graph class is its recognition , i.e. , to efficiently decide whether a given graph belongs to this class or not . for intersection graph classes , all recognition algorithms known to the authors provide an intersection model when",
    "the membership is asserted .",
    "most of them , on the other hand , simply return `` no '' for non - membership , while one might also want some verifiable _ certificate _ for some reason @xcite .",
    "a recognition algorithm is _ certifying _ if it provides both positive and negative certificates .",
    "there are different forms of negative certificates , while a minimal forbidden induced subgraph is arguably the simplest and most preferable of them @xcite .",
    "kratsch et al .",
    "@xcite reported a certifying recognition algorithm for interval graphs , which in linear time returns either an interval model of an interval graph or a forbidden induced subgraph for a non - interval graph . although its returned forbidden induced subgraph is not necessarily minimal , a minimal one can be easily retrieved from it ( see also @xcite for another approach ) .",
    "likewise , a hole can be detected from a non - chordal graph in linear time @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , although a circular - arc model of a circular - arc graph can be produced in linear time @xcite , it remains a challenging open problem to find a negative certificate for a non - circular - arc graph .",
    "the complication of circular - arc graphs may be attributed to two special intersection patterns of circular - arc models that are not possible in interval models .",
    "the first is two arcs intersecting in both ends , and a circular - arc model is called _ normal _ if no such pair exists .",
    "the second is a set of arcs intersecting pairwise but containing no common point , and a circular - arc model is called _ helly _ if no such set exists .",
    "normal and helly circular - arc models are precisely those without three or less arcs covering the whole circle @xcite . a graph that admits such a model is called a _ normal helly circular - arc graph_. in particular , all interval graphs are normal helly circular - arc graphs .",
    "a word of caution is worth on the definition of normal helly circular - arc graphs .",
    "one graph might admit both a normal circular - arc model and a helly circular - arc model but not a normal and helly circular - arc model .",
    "for example , see the graph and its models in fig .",
    "[ fig : normal - and - helly ] .",
    "the fact that the model of fig .",
    "[ fig : normal - model ] ( resp . ,",
    "[ fig : helly - model ] ) is not helly ( resp . , normal )",
    "can be evidenced by arc set @xmath1 ( resp . , @xmath2 ) .",
    "one may want to verify that arranging a normal and helly circular - arc model for this graph is out of the question .",
    "this example convinces us that the set of normal helly circular - arc graphs is _ not _ equivalent to the intersection of normal circular - arc graphs and helly circular - arc graphs , but a proper subset of it .",
    "let us mention some previous work related to normal helly circular - arc graphs .",
    "tucker @xcite gave an algorithm that outputs a proper coloring of any given normal helly circular - arc graph using at most @xmath3 colors , where @xmath4 denotes the size of a maximum clique .",
    "note that by the helly property , @xmath4 is equivalent to the maximum number of arcs covering a single point on the circle .",
    "this is tight as any odd hole , which has @xmath5 and needs at least three colors , is a normal helly circular - arc graph . in the study of convergence of circular - arc graphs under the clique operator , lin et al .",
    "@xcite observed that normal helly circular - arc graphs arose naturally .",
    "they then @xcite undertook a systematic study of normal helly circular - arc graphs as well as its subclass .",
    "their results include a partial characterization of normal helly circular - arc graphs by forbidden induced subgraph ( more specifically , those restricted to helly circular - arc graphs ) , and a linear - time recognition algorithm ( by calling a recognition algorithm for circular - arc graphs ) . as open problems ,",
    "they ask for determining the remaining minimal forbidden induced subgraphs , and designing a direct recognition algorithm , both of which are resolved by the current paper .",
    "the first main result of this paper is a complete characterization of normal helly circular - arc graphs by forbidden induced subgraphs .",
    "a wheel ( resp . , @xmath6 ) comprises a hole and another vertex completely adjacent ( resp . , nonadjacent ) to it .",
    "[ thm : characterization ] a graph is a normal helly circular - arc graph if and only if it contains no @xmath6 , wheel , or any graph depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig : at ] and [ fig : normal - helly ] .",
    "@xmath7 @xmath7 @xmath7 @xmath7 @xmath7    it is easy to use the definition to verify that a normal helly circular - arc graph is chordal if and only if it is an interval graph .",
    "an interval model is always a normal and helly circular - arc model , but an interval graph might have circular - arc model that is neither normal nor helly , e.g. , consider @xmath8 . for non - chordal graphs we have :    [ thm : always - noraml - and - helly ] if a normal helly circular - arc graph @xmath9 is not chordal , then every circular - arc model of @xmath9 is normal and helly .",
    "these observations inspire us to recognize normal helly circular - arc graphs as follows .",
    "if the input graph is chordal , it suffices to check whether it is an interval graph . otherwise , we try to build a circular - arc model of it , and if we succeed , verify whether the model is normal and helly .",
    "lin et al .",
    "@xcite showed that this approach can be implemented in linear time .",
    "moreover , if there exists a set of at most three arcs covering the circle , then their algorithm returns it as a certificate .",
    "this algorithm , albeit conceptually simple , suffers from twofold weakness .",
    "first , it needs to call some recognition algorithm for circular - arc graphs , while all known algorithms are extremely complicated .",
    "second , it is very unlikely to deliver a negative certificate in general .",
    "the second main result of this paper is the following direct certifying algorithm for recognizing normal helly circular - arc graphs , which would be desirable for both efficiency and the detection of negative certificates . from now on , unless otherwise stated , whenever we refer to a `` minimal forbidden induced subgraph '' it should be understood a minimal forbidden induced subgraph for the class of normal helly circular - arc graphs .",
    "we use @xmath10 and @xmath11 throughout .",
    "[ thm : certifying - algorithm ] there is an @xmath12-time algorithm that given a graph @xmath9 , either constructs a normal and helly circular - arc model of @xmath9 , or finds a minimal forbidden induced subgraph of @xmath9 .",
    "it is clear that each graph specified in theorem  [ thm : characterization ] is a minimal forbidden induced subgraph .",
    "first , every graph in fig .",
    "[ fig : at ] is chordal but non - interval graph , and thus can not be a normal helly circular - arc graph .",
    "second , a @xmath6 is not a circular - arc graph , while a wheel can not be arranged without three or less arcs covering the circle .",
    "third , every graph in fig .",
    "[ fig : normal - helly ] has only a small number of vertices and can be easily checked .",
    "therefore , to prove theorem  [ thm : characterization ] , it suffices to show that a graph containing none of them is a normal helly circular - arc graph .",
    "that fact was actually proved in @xcite , but the resulting proof of theorem 1.1 given there does not provide a linear - time procedure to find the corresponding forbidden induced subgraphs when the graph is not a normal helly circular - arc graph . since the algorithm we use to prove theorem  [ thm : certifying - algorithm ] always finds such a subgraph in this case , theorem  [ thm : characterization ] follows from the correctness proof of our algorithm as a corollary .",
    "let us briefly discuss the basic idea behind the way we deal with a non - chordal graph @xmath9 . if @xmath9 is a normal helly circular - arc graph , then for any vertex @xmath13 of @xmath9 , both @xmath14 $ ] and its complement induce nonempty interval subgraphs .",
    "the main technical difficulty is how to combine interval models for them to make a circular - arc model of @xmath9 . for this purpose",
    "we build an auxiliary graph @xmath15 by taking two identical copies of @xmath14 $ ] and appending them to the two ends of @xmath16 $ ] respectively .",
    "the shape of symbol @xmath17 is a good hint for understanding the structure of the auxiliary graph .",
    "we show that @xmath15 is an interval graph and more importantly , a circular - arc model of @xmath9 can be produced from an interval model of @xmath15 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath9 is not a normal helly circular - arc graph , then @xmath15 can not be an interval graph . in this case",
    "we use the following procedure to obtain a minimal forbidden induced subgraph of @xmath9 .",
    "[ thm : negative - certificate ] given a minimal non - interval induced subgraph of @xmath15 , we can in @xmath12 time find a minimal forbidden induced subgraph  of @xmath9 .",
    "the crucial idea behind our certifying algorithm is a novel correlation between normal helly circular - arc graphs and interval graphs , which can be efficiently used for algorithmic purpose .",
    "this was originally proposed in the detection of small forbidden induced subgraph of interval graphs @xcite , i.e. , the opposite direction of the current paper . in particular , in @xcite we have used a similar definition of the auxiliary graph and pertinent observations . however ,",
    "the main structures and the procedures for the detection of forbidden induced subgraphs divert completely .",
    "for example , the most common forbidden induced subgraphs in @xcite are @xmath18- and @xmath19-holes , which , however , are allowed in normal helly circular - arc graphs .",
    "this means that the interaction between @xmath14 $ ] and @xmath16 $ ] are far more subtle , and thus the detection of minimal forbidden induced subgraphs in the current paper is significantly more complicated than that of @xcite .",
    "all graphs are stored as adjacency lists .",
    "we use the customary notation @xmath20 to mean @xmath21 , and @xmath22 to mean @xmath23 .",
    "the _ degree _ of a vertex @xmath13 is defined by latexmath:[$d(v ) : =    @xmath13 , comprises all vertices @xmath25 such that @xmath22 .",
    "the _ closed neighborhood _ of @xmath13 is defined by @xmath14 : = n(v ) \\cup \\{v\\}$ ] . for a vertex set @xmath26 , its closed neighborhood and neighborhood",
    "are defined by @xmath27 : = \\bigcup_{v \\in u } n[v]$ ] and @xmath28 \\backslash u$ ] , respectively .",
    "exclusively concerned with induced subgraphs , we use @xmath29 to denote both a subgraph and its vertex set .    consider a circular - arc model @xmath30 . if every point of the circle is contained in some arc in @xmath30 , then we can find an inclusion - wise minimal set @xmath31 of arcs that cover the entire circle . if @xmath30 is normal and helly , then @xmath31 consists of at least four vertices and thus corresponds to a hole . therefore , a normal helly circular - arc graph  @xmath9 is chordal if and only if it is an interval graph , for which it suffices to call the algorithms of @xcite .",
    "we are hence focused on graphs that are not chordal .",
    "we call the algorithm of tarjan and yannakakis @xcite to detect a hole @xmath32 .",

    "we start from characterizing @xmath37 $ ] for every vertex @xmath13 : we specify some forbidden structures not allowed to appear in a normal helly circular - arc graph , and more importantly , we show how to find a minimal forbidden induced subgraph if one of these structures exists .",
    "the fact that they are forbidden can be easily seen from the definition of normal and helly and proposition  [ lem : fundamental ] , and hence the proofs given below will focus on the detection of minimal forbidden induced subgraphs .",
