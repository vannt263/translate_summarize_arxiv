    "as with all endeavors in science , there is a prehistory involved , and cuprates are no exception .",
    "research in superconductivity was not the languishing field that it is often portrayed as being prior to the bednorz - muller `` revolution '' of 1986 . what had begun to be diminished , though , was the hope that a truly high temperature superconductor would ever be discovered . at the time of the bednorz - muller discovery , the highest temperature superconductor known was nb@xmath0ge ( 23k ) . that material had been known since 1973 , and was not much of an improvement over nbn ( 15k ) which had been discovered all the way back in 1941 @xcite .",
    "this pessimistic outlook was best articulated by bernd matthias in a number of papers which still make interesting reading today @xcite .",
    "such pessimism was not confined to experiment , as witnessed by the famous paper of cohen and anderson @xcite .",
    "as was well appreciated by that time , the a15 materials with highest @xmath1 were on the verge of a structural transition , and thus it was anticipated that one could not push @xmath1 much higher before the lattice became unstable @xcite .    despite this , a number of new classes of superconductors had been discovered in the period before 1986 , including the ternary magnetic superconductors such as errh@xmath2b@xmath2 and homo@xmath3s@xmath4 , and various uranium based superconductors such as @xmath5-u and u@xmath3fe , many of these discovered by matthias and his various associates .",
    "matthias speculation that something really different was going on in f electron superconductors was spectacularly confirmed with the discovery by frank steglich in 1979 of `` heavy fermion '' superconductivity in cecu@xmath6si@xmath6 @xcite , followed by the discovery of superconductivity in upt@xmath0 and ube@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "heavy fermion superconductivity was one of the main research topics in fundamental physics prior to 1986 , and its history has had some impact on the cuprate field . unlike the magnetic superconductors such as errh@xmath2b@xmath2 where the magnetic moments are confined to the rare earth site and the superconductivity to the ligand sites , in heavy fermion superconductors , the f electrons themselves become superconducting .",
    "this is known from the extremely high effective mass of the superconducting carriers .",
    "more properly , the carriers should be thought of as composite objects of conduction electron charge and f electron spin @xcite .",
    "the fascinating thing about these materials , though , is that their superconducting ground states do not appear to have the l=0 , s=0 symmetry that cooper pairs exhibit in normal superconductors @xcite .    as with cuprates , heavy fermion superconductivity had its own prehistory as well , that being the field of superfluid @xmath8he .",
    "@xmath8he had been speculated in the 1960s to possibly be a paired superfluid with non - zero orbital angular momentum , in particular l=2 pairing @xcite .",
    "the idea was that the hard core repulsion of the atoms would prevent l=0 pairing , but that longer range pairs could be stabilized by the attractive van der waals interaction between the he atoms .",
    "subsequently , layzer and fay @xcite showed that for nearly ferromagnetic metals , and @xmath8he as well , spin dependent interactions instead could stabilize l=1 , s=1 pairs , leading to the concept of paramagnon mediated pairing .    at that time",
    ", experimentalists were beginning to push @xmath8he to low temperatures , with the idea of searching for magnetic order under pressure .",
    "this was subsequently discovered by bill halperin .",
    "but along the way , doug osheroff found superfluidity , and various experiments did indeed confirm the l=1 , s=1 nature of the pairs @xcite . more interestingly ,",
    "two paired states were found , the so - called a and b phases .",
    "anderson and brinkman later proposed that the stabilization of the anisotropic a phase relative to the isotropic b phase could be understood by feedback of the pair formation on the spin fluctuation interactions which supposedly gave rise to the pairs to begin with @xcite .",
    "such feedback effects are much in vogue lately in regards to spin fluctuation mediated theories of cuprates @xcite .    what does this imply for the lattice case ?",
    "early theories for heavy fermions were indeed based on the @xmath8he paradigm , but with the discovery of antiferromagnetic correlations by inelastic neutron scattering @xcite , people turned away from these nearly ferromagnetic models ( though they have seen a resurgence of late , with the discovery of superconductivity in uge@xmath9 @xcite and zrzn@xmath6 @xcite ) . rather , theoretical work published in 1986 led to the concept of l=2 , s=0 pairs in the nearly antiferromagnetic case @xcite .",
    "this d - wave model is still one of the leading candidates to describe superconductivity in upt@xmath0 , though a competing model based on f - wave pairs has been proposed by norman@xcite and sauls @xcite .",
    "the problems with determining the pair symmetry in heavy fermions are the multiple band nature of the problem ( orbital degeneracy ) , along with the effects of non - trivial crystal structures ( upt@xmath0 has a non symmorphic lattice , for instance ) and spin - orbit ( which destroys l and s as good quantum numbers ) , not to mention the complications of dealing with three dimensions .",
    "( fortunately none of these problems exist in the cuprates . )",
    "one of the interesting observations of these early calculations was the prediction that for a simple cubic lattice , the d - wave pairs should be of the form @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "if one simply eliminates the third dimension , one obtains the order paramater now known to be the pair state of the cuprates . in some sense ,",
    "the prediction of @xmath11 pairing in the cuprates was the ultimate one liner .",
    "the above path , though , is not what led to the discovery of cuprate superconductors .",
    "the history of this is rather lucidly described in bednorz and muller s nobel lecture @xcite . of particular interest to them was the case of doped srtio@xmath0 .",
    "this material had a @xmath1 of less than 1k , but as it had such an incredibly low carrier density , it should nt have been superconducting at all , at least according to what people thought at the time .",
    "in fact , the properties of this material led to a speculation by eagles about the possibility of bose condensation @xcite , with pairs existing above the superconducting transition temperature , a forerunner of the pseudogap physics currently being discussed for the cuprates .",
    "although binning and bednorz did some work on this material , it never led to much , so binning got bored and moved on to the discovery of the scanning tunneling microscope , which he later got the nobel prize for .",
    "after this , bednorz began to work under alex muller , who was also interested in the possibility of oxide superconductors .",
    "alex was particularly intrigued by the role that jahn - teller effects played in the perovskite structure ; that is , in the distortions of the oxygen octahedra surrounding the transition metal ions which lead to the lifting of the degeneracy of the 3d crystal field levels . while searching around , they became aware of work that raveau s group had done on labacuo , and in the course of reproducing this work , they discovered high temperature superconductivity .",
    "the story subsequently circulated was that raveau took his samples off the shelf , and found that they too were superconducting .",
    "it is on such twists of fate that careers in science are often decided .",
    "after the original discovery , several groups got in the act , and by use of pressure , paul chu s group was able to drive the initial transition temperature of 35k up to 50k .",
    "the real quest , though , was to find a related structure with a higher transition temperature , and this was rapidly discovered in early 1987 , when chu and collaborators found 90k superconductivity in ybco @xcite . the liquid air barrier ( 77k )",
    "had finally been breached , and true high temperature superconductivity had at last been discovered . by varying the crystal structure and again exploiting pressure , transition temperatures up to 160k have been achieved , again by chu s group .",
    "matthias must have been smiling from on high .",
    "the crystal structures of the cuprates were one of the first things elucidated , which is obvious because of the patent rights involved ( after a very long struggle , bell labs eventually won that one @xcite ; for an illuminating account of those heady days , the reader is referred to the book by hazen @xcite ) .",
    "though they come in many variants , the basic structure is quite simple ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the material consists of cuo@xmath6 planes , where each cu ion is four fold coordinated with o ions , separated by insulating spacer layers .",
    "= 0.6    the exception to this is ybco , which has metallic cuo chain layers as one of the spacer layers .",
    "the orginal lbco material had two apical oxygens ( the standard perovskite structure , where the transition metal ion is in the center of an octahedron formed from six surrounding oxygen ions ) , but in ybco , one of these oxygens is absent , and in other structures , such as that formed by electron doped cuprates , the apical oxygens are totally missing .",
    "what this means is that despite all of these complications , the essential structure to worry about are the cuo@xmath6 planes , which was understood early on , particularly by anderson @xcite .",
    "of course , the superconducting transition temperature varies a lot from structure to structure , and is generally higher the more cuo@xmath6 planes per unit cell that there are , but after years of study , most researchers have come to the conclusion that the main c - axis effect is simply to tune the electronic structure of the cuo@xmath6 planes .",
    "when considering these planes , one immediately comes across a basic fact .",
    "most transition metal oxides are insulators with a particular electronic structure .",
    "this is due to the fact that the transition metal 3d level and oxygen 2p level are separated by a greater energy than the energy spread of these levels from band formation .",
    "the net result is one gets separate 3d and 2p energy bands .",
    "the coulomb repulsion on the transition metal site is so large that the 3d band `` mott - hubbardizes '' , spliting into upper and lower hubbard bands separated by this energy scale , u ( typically 8 - 10 ev in the solid ) .",
    "the true energy gap then becomes of the charge transfer type , separating the filled oxygen 2p valence band from the empty 3d conduction ( i.e. , upper hubbard ) band @xcite .",
    "the cuprate case is different , though ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) @xcite . in the solid ,",
    "the cu ion is in a @xmath12 configuration ( @xmath13 ) and the o ion in a @xmath14 configuration ( @xmath15 ) , with the cu 3d energy level above but relatively close to the o 2p energy level . in the layered perovskites ,",
    "the tetragonal environment of the cu ion leads to the single 3d hole having @xmath11 symmetry . in this case , the dominant energy is the bonding - antibonding splitting involving the quantum mechanical mixture of the cu 3d @xmath16 orbital and the planar o @xmath17 and @xmath18 orbitals ( with an energy of 6 ev ) .",
    "= 0.5    the net result is that in the parent ( undoped ) structure , one is left with a half filled band which is the antibonding combination of these three orbitals , with the bonding , non - bonding , and the rest of the cu and o orbitals filled . as anderson speculated early on @xcite",
    ", it is this copper - oxygen antibonding band which `` mott - hubbardizes '' , forming an insulating gap of order 2 ev in the parent compound ( the effective u being reduced because of the cu - o orbital admixture ) .    therefore , in the end , the complicated electronic structure leads to a single 2d energy band near the fermi energy , which is what makes the cuprates so attractive from a theoretical perspective @xcite .",
    "but one can even reduce this `` one band hubbard model '' further by taking the limit of large u. in this case , the upper hubbard band is projected out ( assuming we are considering hole doping the insulator ) , and the effect of u becomes virtual , leading to a superexchange interaction between the cu spins , j ( t@xmath19/u , where t is the effective cu - cu hopping mediated by intervening o sites ) .",
    "this is easily understood by noting that two parallel spins are not allowed to occupy the same cu site because of the pauli exclusion principle , but antiparallel spins can , leading to an energy savings of t@xmath19/u from second order perturbation theory .",
    "this so - called `` t - j '' model is the minimal model for the cuprates . despite the success of motivating this model from first principles calculations @xcite ,",
    "it is not generally agreed upon .",
    "for instance , varma has advocated that one must consider the full three band hubbard model ( one band from each of the three states , cu 3d @xmath16 , o 2p@xmath20 , and o 2p@xmath21 ) .",
    "his claim is that upon projection to the low energy sector , non - trivial phase factors between the three bands become possible , which can lead to an orbital current state which he associates with the pseudogap phase @xcite .",
    "the original hope of anderson was that the insulating phase of the cuprates would turn out to be a spin liquid @xcite .",
    "= 0.5    the issue here is that most mott insulators exhibit broken symmetry , such as antiferromagnetism .",
    "this means that such insulators can be adiabatically continued to an ordinary band insulator with magnetic order , as originally proposed by slater @xcite .",
    "the cuprates would be another example of this , since the half filled band discussed above would become one full and one empty band upon magnetic ordering due to the unit cell doubling ( in this picture , the lower hubbard band would correspond to the up spin band of the band insulator , the upper hubbard band to the down spin band ) .",
    "anderson believed , though , that the mott phenomenon should be unrelated to this argument , and that the cuprates would be the ideal place to demonstrate this . since there is only one d hole per cu site ( and thus , s=1/2 ) , and given the 2d nature of the material , he felt that quantum fluctuations would be sufficient to destroy the order , leading to a spin liquid ground state , which he called a resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state ( harking back to the theory of benzene rings , where each c - c link resonates between a single bond and a double bond state ) .    as was discovered soon after , though , the undoped phase is indeed magnetic , though the moment is reduced by 1/3 from the free ion value due to fluctuations @xcite . on the other hand , magnetic order",
    "is rapidly destroyed upon hole doping , so in fact the magnetic phase only takes up a small sliver ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) of the phase diagram ( in the electron doped case , though , the magnetism exists over a much larger doping range ) .",
    "so , in that sense , anderson s intuition was quite good .    for dopings beyond a few percent ,",
    "the system either enters a messy disordered phase exhibiting spin glass behavior ( as in lsco ) before superconducting order sets in , or immediately goes to the superconducting phase ( as in ybco ) .",
    "the superconducting transition monotonically rises with doping , reaching a maximum at about 16% doping , after which @xmath1 declines to zero .",
    "the net effect is to form a superconducting `` dome '' which extends from about 5% to 25% doping .    at first sight , the superconducting phase is not so different from that of classical superconductors .",
    "we know that it exhibits a zero resistance state with a meissner effect .",
    "experiments show that the superconducting objects are charge 2e , and thus pairs are formed .",
    "what is unusual , though , are the short coherence lengths . for typical superconductors ,",
    "the coherence length is quite long , usually several hundered @xmath22 or more .",
    "this is in contrast to magnets , which have quite short coherence lengths .",
    "therefore , for most superconductors we know , mean field theory works extremely well , as opposed to magnets where it almost always fails .",
    "but cuprates exhibit short coherence lengths , of order 20@xmath22 in the plane , and a paltry 2@xmath22 between planes .",
    "the latter is so short , the cuprates are essentially composed of josephson coupled planes , as has been experimentally verified by a number of groups @xcite .",
    "such coupling is necessary , of course , since long range superconducting order can not occur in two dimensions ( except the kosterlitz - thouless phase , whose existence in the cuprates is still debated @xcite ) .",
    "another unusual finding is the symmetry of the order parameter ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . for many years",
    ", it was felt that the order parameter probably had s - wave symmetry .",
    "= 0.8    there was no evidence from thermodynamic measurements for nodes in the gap as in heavy fermion superconductors , except for an early report of a non - exponential temperature dependence of the knight shift @xcite . and",
    "the cuprates were viewed as quite disordered ( doping being achieved by chemical substitution ) , which is known to be pair breaking for unconventional superconductors .",
    "this was despite the prediction of d - wave pairing from both spin fluctuation models @xcite and rvb theory @xcite .",
    "but this begin to change when nmr measurements found a @xmath23 variation of the spin lattice relaxation rate , as found in heavy fermion superconductors , as opposed to the exponential behavior found in s - wave superconductors @xcite .",
    "this was soon followed by penetration depth measurements , where a corresponding linear in t behavior was found @xcite . at the same time , angle resolved photoemission measurements gave direct spectroscopic evidence for nodes in the gap @xcite .    of course , the possibility still remained that the order parameter was s - wave , but with a highly anisotropic gap .",
    "these worries were put to rest once and for all by phase sensitive measurements .",
    "the first of these was by van harlingen s group .",
    "following suggestions by leggett , they formed sis tunneling junctions on the ac and bc faces of ybco , using an ordinary s - wave superconductor as the counterelectrode .",
    "these two junctions were then connected , and the superconducting phase difference measured from the dependence of the josephson critical current on applied magnetic field .",
    "they found exactly the @xmath24 phase shift expected for a d - wave state ( which differs by a minus sign between the two orthogonal a and b directions ) @xcite .",
    "this was soon followed by the tricrystal grain boundary experiments of tsuei and kirtley @xcite , where three grain boundaries at different orientations were brought together at a point .",
    "thus , about the tricrystal point , there are three junctions .",
    "each junction will act as a  zero \" junction or a @xmath24 junction depending on the superconducting phase difference across the junction .",
    "if the number of such @xmath24 junctions is odd , then a half integral flux quantum will appear at the tricrystal point .",
    "the advantage of this method is that by varying the crystallographic orientation of the three grains , the symmetry of the order parameter can be mapped out in detail .",
    "the net result was that for only those orientations where d - wave symmetry predicted a half integral flux quantum was one observed .",
    "as ybco is orthorhombic , though , there still remained an out ( since s - wave and d - wave are the same group representation in that crystal structure ) , but the tricrystal experiments were repeated for tl2201 , which has tetragonal symmetry , with the same results @xcite .",
    "after that , there was no question anymore about the order parameter symmetry , and for these pioneering efforts , four of the researchers were awarded the buckley prize in 1998 .",
    "perhaps the most unusual finding , though , is the difference of the dynamics between the normal and superconducting states .",
    "as will be discussed below , the normal state of the cuprates ( away from the overdoped side of the phase diagram ) does not appear to be a landau fermi liquid .",
    "on the other hand , a variety of experiments , first microwave conductivity @xcite , then thermal conductivity @xcite , infrared conductivity @xcite , and photoemission @xcite , revealed that the scattering rate of the electrons at low energies drops precipitously in the superconducting state ( right panel , fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) . at low temperatures in ybco ,",
    "mean free paths of the order of microns have been inferred for the electrons , as opposed to the very short mean free paths found in the normal state .",
    "this strong loss in inelastic scattering would be unusual for an electron - phonon mediated superconductor , since the phonons are not gapped in the superconducting state .",
    "the implication , then , is that the primary scattering is electron - electron like in character , and thus is strongly reduced in the superconducting state since the electrons become gapped .",
    "this can be easily seen from the lowest order feynman diagram ( left panel , fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , showing an electron scattering off a particle - hole excitation ) , since every internal line in the diagram is gapped by @xmath25 ( a point first noted by nozieres in his famous book@xcite ) .",
    "= 0.8    this obviously points to an electron - electron origin to the pairing as well .",
    "this brings us to a consideration of the rest of the phase diagram . as discussed above",
    ", cuprates should be thought of as doped mott insulators .",
    "what this means is that for low doping , the number of carriers is small .",
    "as the superconducting phase is conjugate to the number operator , this implies that phase fluctuations could play an important role on the underdoped side of the phase diagram .",
    "again , this was realized early on by anderson , who proposed that the doped holes would only be phase coherent below a temperature which scaled linearly with doping @xcite . this should be contrasted with the `` pairing '' scale , which within the rvb model would be maximal for the insulator , and then drops to zero on the overdoped side when the bandwidth @xmath26 of the doped holes becomes comparable to the superexchange energy @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "= 0.8    these two crossing lines led to the proposal of a generic `` rvb '' phase diagram ( left panel , fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) @xcite composed of four phases , a superconductor ( bottom quadrant ) , a fermi liquid ( right quadrant ) , a strange metal phase ( upper quadrant ) , and a spin gap phase ( left quadrant , now known as the pseudogap phase ) . in this picture ,",
    "only the superconducting phase ( which lies below both crossing lines ) should be considered as having true long range order , otherwise , these `` phase '' lines should be considered as crossover lines .",
    "the first of these `` phases '' which was studied in detail was the strange metal phase .",
    "transport measurements revealed that the resistivity was dead linear in temperature over a large range , the most amazing example of this being in single layer bi2201 , where linearity persisted down to 10k ( when superconductivity finally occurred ) @xcite .",
    "no saturation at high temperatures was observed as occurs in a15 superconductors .",
    "this behavior was further confirmed by a generalized drude analysis of infrared data , which shows a scattering rate linear in energy up to half an ev @xcite . these striking observations led varma and colleagues to propose the so - called marginal fermi liquid phenomenology for the strange metal phase @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the electrons are assumed to be scattering off a bosonic spectrum which is linear in energy up to an energy scale t , then constant afterwards .",
    "because of this , no energy enters the problem except the temperature ( modulo an ultraviolet cut - off ) , a phenomenon referred to as quantum critical scaling .",
    "this in turn has led to the proposal of an alternate ( to the `` rvb '' ) phase diagram based on a quantum critical point ( right panel , fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "in such a picture , the ordered phase ( to the left of the critical point ) would correspond to the pseudogap phase , its disordered analogue ( to the right of the critical point ) to the fermi liquid phase , and the quantum critical regime ( above the critical point ) to the strange metal phase .",
    "the superconducting `` dome '' surrounds the critical point , screening it like an event horizon of a black hole .",
    "we note that the fermi liquid / strange metal boundary is a crossover line in both phase diagram scenarios , but the strange metal / pseudogap boundary is a crossover line in the rvb model and a true phase line in the quantum critical model .",
    "an exception is in certain antiferromagnetic quantum critical scenarios where the  phase line \" corresponds to short range 2d order @xcite .",
    "this brings us to the most controversial aspect of the cuprate field , the nature of the pseudogap phase @xcite .",
    "the first experimental indication of such a phase was from nmr measurements by the bell group , which showed that the spin lattice relaxation rate of underdoped cuprates begins to decrease well above @xmath1 ( left panel , fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) @xcite . a similar decrease",
    "is seen in the knight shift @xcite , which measures the bulk susceptibility ( nmr measuring the zero energy limit of the imaginary part of the dynamic susceptibility divided by the energy ) .",
    "a signature of a gap was also evident in infrared measurements , which showed a dip in the conductance separating the low energy drude peak from the so - called mid - infrared bump @xcite , with the temperature dependence of the conductance near the dip energy @xcite scaling with the spin lattice relaxation rate @xcite .",
    "the resulting sharpening of the drude peak leads to a decrease of the planar resistivity in the pseudogap phase @xcite .",
    "= 0.5 = 0.5    but the most dramatic effect was in c - axis polarized infrared measurements , which showed a significant gap at low energies ( no drude peak ) , with the temperature dependence of the subgap conductance @xcite tracking the knight shift ( right panel , fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) @xcite .",
    "this leads to an insulating up turn below the pseudogap temperature , @xmath28 , in the c - axis resistivity @xcite .    what brought the pseudogap effect to the forefront , though , was its observation by angle resolved photoemission @xcite .",
    "these experiments found that although the quasiparticle peak in the spectral function was destroyed above @xmath1 , the spectral gap persisted to the higher temperature , @xmath28 .",
    "this so - called leading edge gap had a similar magnitude and momentum anisotropy as the superconducting energy gap , leading to the speculation that this gap was a precursor to the superconducting gap , that is , that the pseudogap phase represented pairs without long range phase order @xcite .",
    "this picture was consistent with the nmr and knight shift data , in that pair formation is equivalent to singlet formation , and thus the knight shift and the spin lattice relaxation rate should decrease accordingly @xcite . the strong coupling limit of this picture is simply the rvb physics mentioned above , where the pseudogap state corresponds to d - wave pairing of spins .",
    "this picture received further support by later arpes experiments which showed that the pseudogap s minimum gap locus in momentum space coincided with the normal state fermi surface .",
    "that is , the pseudogap is locked to the fermi surface , as would be expected for a q=0 instability @xcite ( in superconductors , pairs have zero center of mass momentum ) .",
    "later tunneling experiments were found to be in support of this picture as well @xcite .    despite this",
    ", the situation , even from arpes , remains controversial .",
    "arpes experiments reveal that the pseudogap turns off at different momentum points at different temperatures , leading to the presence of temperature dependent fermi arcs ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) @xcite .",
    "= 0.8    these arcs persist to low doping ; they have even been observed for lsco at a 3% doping level , where the system is on the verge of magnetism @xcite .",
    "some authors have taken this as evidence that these arcs represent one side of a small hole pocket , the latter picture expected when doping the magnetic insulating phase ( the idea being that sdw coherence factors suppress the intensity on the back side of the pocket ) .",
    "this magnetic precursor scenario is one of the leading alternates to the preformed pairs picture . despite much searching , though",
    ", no arpes experiment to date as ever seen a true hole pocket centered about @xmath29 .",
    "another explanation has been put forward that the pseudogap represents an orbital current phase .",
    "this was implicit in certain treatments of the rvb model , which predicted at low dopings the presence of a so - called staggered flux phase , which is quantum mechanically equivalent to the d - wave pair state in the zero doping limit @xcite .",
    "this has been generalized to the d density wave state , first discussed by heinz schulz @xcite , but popularized by laughlin and colleagues @xcite .",
    "a related picture has been put forth by varma , where his orbital current phase is the result of a non - trivial projection of the three band hubbard model onto the low energy sector @xcite .",
    "some experimental evidence for such a state was obtained from inelastic neutron scattering which indicated a momentum form factor inconsistent with simple cu spins @xcite , but after studies by several groups , the feeling is that the observed effect may represent an impurity phase ( always a problem for neutrons given the large crystals needed for such measurements ) . the latest evidence , though",
    ", has been given again by arpes , where campuzano s group has done measurements with circularly polarized light @xcite .",
    "what they have found is the presence of chiral symmetry breaking below @xmath28 .",
    "the momentum dependence of the effect , though , is not what is expected from the d density wave scenario , though one of the two orbital current states proposed by varma appears to be consistent with these observations @xcite .",
    "the main debate , though , is whether the pseudogap phase represents a state with true long range order ( which the neutron and circularly polarized arpes give some evidence for ) , or simply some precursor phase . if it is the former , then the preformed pairs scenario is probably wrong , unless the ordering is some parasitical effect .",
    "long range order is certainly in line with a quantum critical point scenario .",
    "additional support for such a scenario comes from various measurements by loram and tallon ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) , who claim that the pseudogap phase line passes through the superconducting dome and goes to zero at some critical point within the dome ( 19% doping ) @xcite .",
    "= 1.0    one of the strongest points given as evidence for their conjecture is that upon impurity doping , the superconducting dome appears to collapse about the pseudogap phase line ( right panel , fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) . in their picture , the specific heat data indicate a loss of states in the pseudogap phase .",
    "this implies that the pseudogap eats up part of the fermi surface , leaving a smaller part available for pairing , thus explaining the collapse of @xmath1 on the underdoped side .",
    "this `` mean field '' picture is in total contrast to the phase fluctuation picture discussed in the context of the precursor pairing scenario @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been a new measurement which comes out in support of the precursor pair scenario .",
    "ong s group has measured the nernst effect , the coefficient of a higher order transport tensor which is very small in normal metals , but is appreciable in superconductors because of the presence of vortices .",
    "what they find is a sizable nernst signal on the underdoped side of the phase diagram which persists well above @xmath1 , though not as high in temperature as the arpes pseudogap @xcite .",
    "the only explanation that has been put forth for this amazing observation is that the pseudogap phase does indeed contain vortices .",
    "this may be connected to the results of stm measurements , which reveal that the pseudogap forms in the vortex cores in the superconducting state for underdoped samples @xcite .",
    "how one crosses over from the fermi arc state to the insulator is still an unresolved issue . in one scenario , the chemical potential jumps from the middle of the mott - hubbard gap to either the lower hubbard band upon hole doping , or the upper hubbard band upon electron doping .",
    "there is some evidence of this from photoemission . in particular ,",
    "the fermi arc is in a momentum region near the @xmath29 point , and the latter is the top of the valence band in the insulator , as seen by photoemission in sr@xmath6cuo@xmath6cl@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this picture has been bolstered recently by photoemission experiments on the sodium doped version of this insulator , which also find a fermi arc @xcite .",
    "the other scenario is that upon doping , one creates new states inside the gap .",
    "shen s group has given evidence that the latter scenario occurs in lsco , and argues that this is associated with the strong inhomogeneities present in that material @xcite , though it should be remarked that 3% doped lsco has the same fermi arc that is seen in other hole doped cuprates such as na doped sr@xmath6cuo@xmath6cl@xmath6 @xcite and underdoped bi2212 @xcite .",
    "this brings us to the question of stripes . at low doping",
    ", materials can be subject to electronic phase separation .",
    "this tendency occurs since each doped hole breaks four magnetic bonds , and thus this magnetic energy loss can be minimized by the holes clumping together .",
    "this clumping is opposed by the coulomb repulsion of the holes .",
    "this led to the picture that the doped holes , as a compromise , might form rivers of charge , known as stripes @xcite .",
    "the first evidence for such stripes was given by tranquada and co - workers using neutron scattering ( fig .  [ fig10 ] ) @xcite .",
    "to understand their result , it should be noted that lsco has a peculiarity in its phase diagram .",
    "lsco is normally orthorhombic , the tetragonal phase existing either at high temperatures or under pressure . near 1/8",
    "hole doping , though , lsco has a tendency to distort from its normal orthorhombic phase to another distorted phase known as low temperature tetragonal , which differs from the high temperature tetragonal phase mentioned above @xcite .",
    "= 0.8    this ltt phase is stabilized by neodynium doping .",
    "what tranquada and co - workers found was that the ltt phase exhibited long range ordering consistent with the formation of a 1d density wave state .",
    "both charge and spin ordering occurs , but the former sets in at a higher temperature .",
    "this stripe formation is consistent with later photoemission @xcite and transport @xcite measurements , which again indicate 1d behavior .    what remains controversial , though , is whether stripes exist only for this anomalous nd - doped lsco compound .",
    "strong incommensurate magnetic spots are seen by inelastic neutron scattering for various dopings in lsco @xcite and ybco @xcite , and have been taken as evidence for the existence of dynamic stripes @xcite , given their resemblance to the static spot pattern of nd - doped lsco @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , these spot patterns can also be reproduced from standard linear response calculations based on the known fermi surface geometry @xcite .    what is clear , though",
    ", is that there is a definite tendency for underdoped materials to exhibit electronic inhomogeneity .",
    "the most dramatic example of this has been recently provided by stm studies on underdoped bi2212 by davis group @xcite .",
    "what they find is the existence of large gap regions ( which have spectra reminiscent of the pseuodgap phase ) imbedded in smaller gap regions , with the relative fraction of the larger gap regions increasing with underdoping , similar to earlier results by roditchev s group @xcite .",
    "the large gap domains have a size of order 30@xmath22 .",
    "this granular picture would certainly suggest that the pseudogap phase is not a simple precursor to the superconducting phase as has been asserted by previous arpes and stm studies .",
    "more recently , the same group has seen a charge density wave state associated with the vortex cores which they inferred from fourier transformation of the real space stm spectra @xcite .",
    "an anisotropy of the pattern gave some indication that this might involve stripe formation .",
    "but even more recently , the same group has done a fourier transformation of zero field data @xcite .",
    "they find a weaker inhomogeneity in this case , but more interestingly , the fourier peaks dispersed with energy . although the interpretation of such fourier transforms remain controversial ( kapitulnik s group @xcite sees similar patterns which they attribute to stripe formation ) , the latest results @xcite are consistent with friedel oscillations from impurities whose momentum wavevectors can be used to map out the fermi surface and gap anisotropy .",
    "the results are consistent with previous arpes studies , and have been taken as support of the interpretation of incommensurability in neutron scattering as due to the fermi surface geometry , as opposed to stripes .",
    "electron doped materials have been less studied , mainly due to metallurgical problems .",
    "what has been learned , though , is that the magnetic phase extends much further in doping than on the hole doped side @xcite .",
    "the superconducting phase has a lower @xmath1 than on the hole doped side , probably for the same reason .",
    "a pseudogap phase is observed which appears to be a precursor to the magnetic phase in that they exist over the same doping range @xcite , though it should be remarked that the pseudogap seen is not the leading edge gap ( discussed above in the context of arpes ) , but rather the `` high energy pseudogap '' to be discussed later on in the arpes section .",
    "the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter is still somewhat controversial in these materials .",
    "earlier penetration depth measurements @xcite and point contact tunneling @xcite showed behavior expected for s - wave pairing , but more recent penetration depth measurements have found a power law temperature dependence consistent with a disordered d - wave state @xcite .",
    "recent arpes measurements are also consistent with d - wave symmetry @xcite , but these experiments are near the resolution limit because of the small energy gap .",
    "it should be mentioned that the tri - crystal experiments mentioned above in the context of hole doped superconductors have been performed for the electron - doped case as well , and again find a half integral flux quantum in geometries predicted by d - wave symmetry @xcite .",
    "based on these developments , it is fairly certain that the pairing symmetry is d - wave in these systems .",
    "more recently , raman studies by blumberg and co - workers @xcite find evidence that the superconducting gap maximum is displaced away from the fermi surface crossing along @xmath30 ( as expected for a d - wave gap based on near neighbor pairs ) to the `` hot spots '' ( where the fermi surface crosses the magnetic brillouin zone boundary ) .",
    "this result is consistent with spin fluctuation mediated pairing if the magnetic correlation length is long ( not surprising , given the persistence of long range magnetic order over a larger part of the electron doped phase diagram ) .",
    "it should be noted that arpes sees an intensity suppression at these `` hot spots '' @xcite associated with the formation of the `` high energy pseudogap '' @xcite mentioned above .",
    "in addition , at low dopings , low energy spectral weight is found around the @xmath31 point @xcite , as opposed to the @xmath29 point characteristic of the hole - doped material .",
    "this electron - hole asymmetry is what is expected if the chemical potential jumps to the upper hubbard band upon electron doping .",
    "the first microscopic theory of superconductivity , the much celebrated bcs theory @xcite , took many years to come about @xcite .",
    "the reason was that the machinery needed to construct a proper many - body theory of electrons did not emerge until the 1950s .",
    "the motivation behind the theory was the isotope experiments of 1950 and their simultaneous prediction by frohlich based on the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "bardeen also understood the critical role that the concept of an energy gap would play in the ultimate theory .",
    "once leon cooper , an expert in many - body theory , joined bardeen s group as a postdoc , progress was rapidly made .",
    "what was known by that time was that the electron - phonon interaction could provide attraction among the electrons .",
    "the way this works is as follows ( left panel , fig .",

    "positive ions are attracted to an electron because of the coulomb interaction .",
    "but , the ion dynamics are slow because of their heavy mass .",
    "thus , once the electron moves away , another electron can move into this `` ionic hole '' before the ions have a chance to relax back .",
    "this provides attraction at the same point in space which can lead to pair formation .",
    "the interaction is retarded in time , though , which is what ultimately puts a limit on the transition temperature ( energy , and thus temperature , being conjugate to time ) .",
    "such a `` pair '' theory had been proposed in the past , but the physics of conventional superconductors does not resemble simple bose condensation , despite the fact that a pair of fermions behaves quantum mechanically like a boson .",
    "the key discovery by cooper was the concept of cooper pairs .",
    "the idea is that one is dealing with a degenerate system , that is , a filled fermi sea .",
    "the problem cooper considered was two electrons sitting in unoccupied states above the fermi sea .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , the particle - particle response function diverges logarithmically because the fermi distribution function of the electrons approaches a step function .",
    "this divergence is strongest when the two electrons are in time reversed states ( that is , a state k and a state -k , thus the center of mass momentum of the pair is q=0 ) . note the difference from the particle - hole response at q=0 , which simply measures the density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "this logarithmic divergence is cut - off at some ultraviolet energy scale , which in the electron - phonon problem is the debye energy , @xmath32 .",

    "in essence , there is no migdal s theorm in this case @xcite , and so one may question such a theory which does not take into account vertex corrections .",
    "the justification that is often given is that if one considers the electrons and spin fluctuations as separate objects ( like electrons and phonons ) , then as the spin fluctuations are `` slow '' relative to electrons , one gets something like a migdal s theorem .",

    "the standard way of thinking about these peaks was that they were due to the fermi surface geometry @xcite .",

    "the doped holes become phase coherent , leading to rebinding of spin and charge , and the formation of a true superconducting ground state .",
    "the stripes picture is not unrelated to the rvb picture , in that the pseudogap is due to the spin gap present in the magnetic insulating domains between the stripes .    in the other class of scenarios ,",
    "the pseudogap is not related to superconductivity per se , but rather is competitive with it .",
    "most of these scenarios involve either a charge density wave or spin density wave , usually without long range order .",

    "this is an old idea , going back to the a15 superconductors where the martensitic phase transition competes with superconductivity @xcite .",
    "these models have a certain attractiveness , since the basic physics can be appreciated at the mean field level .",

    "the last point may correspond to where the fermi surface topology changes from hole - like to electron - like ( that is , the saddle point in the dispersion at @xmath31 passes through the fermi energy ) , as there is some evidence of this from arpes .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the `` quantum critical paradigm '' with its emphasis on competing phases is the proper way of thinking about cuprates @xcite .",
    "it has certainly led to an enrichment in our understanding of these novel materials @xcite .",
    "as emphasized by anderson , angle resolved photoemission has emerged as one of the most important spectroscopic probes of cuprate superconductors , in some sense playing the role that tunneling spectroscopy played in conventional superconductors @xcite .",
    "of course , much has been discovered about cuprates using tunneling , but anderson s statement was meant to emphasize the fact that photoemission played no role in the past , and then all of the sudden stepped up to play a major role in the cuprate problem . for those of us working in the `` old days '' , these developments have been nothing short of amazing .    to understand how this came about , a few comments are in order about photoemission .",
    "this technique has a venerable history ; in fact , it was for explaining the photoelectric effect , discovered by hertz in 1887 , that einstein got his nobel prize . although the concept for doing angle resolved experiments had been recognized , the general perception was that not much useful would be learned .",
    "this changed in the early 1960s when spicer developed the three - step model for photoemission , showing that in principle , important information about the electronic structure could be elucidated .",
    "subsequent experiments by a number of groups , including dean eastman s , were able to determine the electronic dispersion of transition metals using this technique @xcite .",
    "for these developments , spicer and eastman received the buckley prize in 1980 .",
    "the technique involves shining photons on a sample with a specific energy .",
    "if the photons have an energy larger than the work function of the metal , then electrons will be emitted . in angle",
    "resolved mode , an electrostatic detector measures the azimuthal and polar angles of the electrons ( relative to the surface normal ) , as well as their energy .",
    "knowing the energy of the photon , then the initial energy of the electrons in the crystal can be determined , as well as the components of the momentum parallel to the sample surface . in principle , the perpendicular component of the momentum is also determined from the energy - momentum relation ( the electrons in vacuum having an energy which is quadratic in momentum ) , but there are subtleties connected with the breaking of the crystal symmetry by the surface in this direction .",
    "the actual photocurrent is very complicated , since it is formally a three current correlation function ( this is the so - called one - step model for photoemission ) .",
    "but in the three - step approximation of spicer , where the initial electron is photoexcited , this photoelectron transports through the crystal , then out in the vacuum to the detector , the photocurrent ( for one band ) can be written as @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the modulus squared of the matrix element of the operator @xmath95 between initial and final states ( @xmath96 is the vector potential , @xmath97 the momentum operator ) , @xmath58 the single particle spectral function ( @xmath98 , where @xmath70 is the electron greens function ) , @xmath99 the fermi - dirac function , and @xmath100 the energy resolution function ( a guassian ) .",
    "the momentum integration is a window ( @xmath101 ) centered about @xmath102 which represents the finite momentum resolution of the spectrometer .",
    "this expression assumes the impulse ( or sudden ) approximation , where the interaction of the photoelectron with the photohole is ignored .",
    "moreover , the expression implicitly assumes the 2d limit , which fortunately is relevant for the cuprate case , where @xmath103 dispersion effects are weak ( `` bilayer splitting '' is a different matter ) .",
    "the significance of this expression is obvious .",
    "the single particle spectral function is the simplest quantity which emerges from a many - body theory of electrons .",
    "we note that @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the bare energy and @xmath106 the dyson self - energy .",
    "a simple example of this is bcs theory , where @xmath107 . since the momentum distribution function ( many - body occupation factor ) is given by @xmath108 , then modulo resolution and dipole matrix elements , the frequency integral of the arpes spectrum is @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "one problem with photoemission is that it is a surface sensitive probe , particularly for the low energy ( @xmath110 20 ev ) photons typically used to achieve high energy and momentum resolution . even in the quasi-2d cuprates",
    ", this can lead to problems unless a natural cleavage plane exists .",
    "this is why most measurements have been done on bscco , which contains a double bio spacer layer , with the two bio layers having the biggest interplanar separation in the cuprates ( these layers are at a separation typical of van der waals interactions ) .",
    "this provides the best possible cleavage in the cuprates .",
    "the penalty one pays is that the bio layers have planar bonds which are longer than the cuo bonds .",
    "the material tries to compensate for this by developing a superstructure deformation of the bio planes .",
    "this can lead to `` ghost '' images of the main cuo signal due to diffraction of the photoelectrons off the bio surface layer , which have to be taken into account when interpreting arpes spectra @xcite .",
    "the advantage of arpes , though , is now obvious .",
    "it is both a momentum and frequency resolved probe .",
    "the only other probe comparable to this is inelastic neutron scattering , which measures a more complicated function ( the spin part of the particle - hole response ) .",
    "such a momentum resolved probe was not essential in classic s - wave superconductors where momentum dependent effects are not important , but we know they are essential to consider in the d - wave case .",
    "this is an obvious advantange of arpes over tunneling , though the latter still has much better energy resolution , and has the advantage of being able to see unoccupied states as well . on the other hand ,",
    "important spatial information can be obtained by stm , which measures the local density of states , which is beyond the scope of this review .",
    "the true impact of arpes was recently realized by the development of the scienta detector , which allows collection of data simulataneously as a function of momentum and energy . in angle",
    "integrated mode , energy resolutions of order 2 mev become possible , allowing even conventional superconductors to be studied by photoemission @xcite . but",
    "even though the energy resolution is not as good in angle resolved mode ( typically 10 - 20 mev ) , it is adequate for the cuprates , and the momentum resolution is quite good , of order 0.005 of a reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "this precision in momentum allows fine details of the spectral function to now be resolved .",
    "it is certainly a far cry from the pre - cuprate era , when momentum resolutions were typically 0.1 of a reciprocal lattice vector , and energy resolutions were typically 100 mev .",
    "the power of the scienta detectors can be appreciated by looking at the expression for the spectral function @xmath111 in the past , spectra were typically analyzed at fixed @xmath102 as a function of energy ( edc ) .",

    "but at fixed @xmath76 as a function of @xmath102 instead , the momentum lineshape ( so - called mdc @xcite ) is considerably simpler . in the normal state near the fermi energy",
    ", we can typically linearize @xmath112 in momenta normal to the fermi surface . as long as @xmath113 can also be linearized",

    "then @xmath113 can be read off from the mdc dispersion , and @xmath72 from the mdc width , though it should be noted that the latter is only true if the resolution is accounted for in the analysis .",

    "on the other hand , some authors have suggested that the intrinsic lineshape might be fairly isotropic , with the observed anisotropy in bi2212 a combination of overlap of features due to the `` ghost '' images associated with the superstructure , along with bilayer splitting of the energy bands @xcite .",
    "the issue of bilayer splitting has been somewhat controversial , and thus deserves some attention .",

    "there is some attractiveness to this phonon picture , but one should recognize that ( 1 ) most of the `` normal '' state data were actually taken in the pseudogap phase and ( 2 ) the constancy of the energy scale is somewhat surprising in a phonon model as well , since the kink energy , even at the node , should be the sum of the maximum superconducting gap energy plus the mode energy ( phonon or otherwise ) . also , it is somewhat surprising that only a single phonon energy would appear in the data .",
    "still , the arguments being invoked in the lanzara paper @xcite are quite important , in that they address the fundamental issue of whether the many - body effects in the cuprates should be associated with phonons ( as in classic superconductors ) or with electron - electron interactions ( as has been commonly assumed in the literature ) .",

    "we should note that although the strong collapse of the scattering rate with temperature below @xmath1 is consistent with arpes results near @xmath31 @xcite , the arpes results along the nodal direction are still controversial , where a linear t behavior below @xmath1 has been claimed by one group ( fig .",

    "recent developments in optics have focused on the issue of the condensation energy , which brings us to the topic of the next section .",
    "the condensation energy is defined as the energy difference between the normal and superconducting states at t=0 ( at finite temperature , the entropy must be taken into account ) . since",
    "normal state properties are temperature dependent , then this requires an extrapolation to infer a hypothetical zero temperature normal state .",
    "most estimates of the condensation energy have been made from specific heat data , which have been recently used to suggest a quantum critical point just beyond optimal doping based in part on the doping dependence of the inferred condensation energy @xcite , which has a maximum near the suggested critical point ( middle panel , fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) .",
    "we begin our story with a piece of pre - bcs history . in 1956 , chester published a paper demonstrating where the condensation energy was coming from in conventional superconductors @xcite .",
    "what he chose to study was the full hamiltonian of the solid , which is composed of the kinetic energies of the electrons and ions , and the electron - electron , electron - ion , and ion - ion interactions . exploiting the dependence of @xmath119 on ion mass ( isotope effect ) and the virial theorem",
    ", he was able to demonstrate that : ( 1 ) the potential energy of the electrons is reduced in the superconducting state , ( 2 ) the kinetic energy of the electrons is increased , and ( 3 ) the ion kinetic energy is reduced . for the classic value of the isotope coefficient ( 1/2 ) , the potential and kinetic energy changes of the electrons actually cancel , which means that the entire condensation energy is equivalent to the lowering of the ion kinetic energy .",
    "this is not what occurs in bcs theory , of course .",
    "the reason is that it is an effective theory gotten by projecting the full hamiltonian onto the low energy subspace .",
    "in such a theory , the ion kinetic energy term is absorbed into the definition of the potential energy , and so superconductivity is due to a lowering of the effective potential energy of the low energy electrons . note that the virial theorem does not apply to the projected hamiltonian , and so can not be used as a guide .",
    "as for the kinetic energy , in bcs theory , the normal state is taken to be that of non - interacting electrons . because of this , the effective kinetic energy of the electrons is exactly diagonalized .",
    "that is , the momentum distribution function is equal to 1 for @xmath184 and 0 for @xmath185 . in the superconducting state , particle - hole mixing occurs , leading to @xmath186 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) .",
    "so , the `` smearing '' of @xmath187 ( fig .  [ fig49 ] ) leads to an increase of the kinetic energy .",
    "= 0.5    the potential and kinetic energy differences are straightforward to calculate in bcs theory , and this exercise can be found in tinkham s book @xcite .",
    "although each term is ultraviolet divergent ( and thus cut - off at the debye energy ) , the sum is convergent , equal to @xmath188 where @xmath34 is the density of states .",
    "of course , the normal state of the cuprates is not a fermi liquid ( at least for optimal and underdoped samples ) , so bcs considerations could be misleading .    in section 4 , we discussed one attempt to get at a piece of the condensation energy .",
    "it was noted by scalapino and white @xcite that the difference of the exchange energy between the normal and superconducting states could be obtained from an integral involving the difference of @xmath189 between the normal and superconducting states .",
    "demler and zhang @xcite noted that for optimal doped ybco , the normal state @xmath189 is small , and so an estimate could be made in that case by simply integrating the neutron resonance ( see figs .",
    "[ fig41 ] and [ fig42 ] ) .",
    "the resulting energy change ( the exchange energy is lowered in the superconducting state ) is in excess of the known condensation energy , and they suggested this was compensated by an expected increase in the kinetic energy in the superconducting state . although the latter is true in bcs theory , is it necessarily true in general ?",
    "recent optics data give evidence to the contrary , as we now discuss .",
    "anderson has noted that several unusual properties of the cuprates could be understood if spectral weight from high energies were transfered to low energies when going from the normal to the superconducting state @xcite . under such conditions , one might anticipate the kinetic energy of the electrons to actually be lowered in the superconducting state rather than raised as in bcs theory .",
    "this was also suggested by hirsch , who predicted a `` violation '' of the optical sum rule due to this effect @xcite .",
    "that is , in a conventional superconductor , the weight appearing in the zero frequency condensate peak comes entirely from the weight removed by the @xmath82 gap in the optical response ( a result known as the tinkham - ferrell - glover sum rule @xcite ) . but",
    "a `` violation '' would indicate that more weight was present in the condensate peak than expected ( fig .",
    "[ fig50 ] ) @xcite .",
    "= 0.5    to understand this , it is necessary to find a relation between the optics and kinetic energy .",
    "the optical sum rule of interest is the same one discussed in section 5 @xmath190 this integral is well known when integrated over all energy bands , and is simply proportional to the bare carrier density , @xmath191 , over the bare electron mass , @xmath192 . by charge conservation ( @xmath191 fixed ) , this integral",
    "is always conserved .    on the other hand , what is of interest here is the `` single band '' sum rule @xmath193 where @xmath194 and @xmath195 projects onto the single band subspace . in these expressions",

    "this was first derived by kubo @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the kinetic energy for this band is @xmath198 thus , the optical integral is of similar form , but not identical , to the kinetic energy @xcite , except for a near neighbor tight binding form for @xmath197 , where @xmath199 . in practice",
    ", the optical integral must be cut off at some energy so that interband terms are not included ( typically 1 ev in the cuprates ) .",
    "there have been a number of studies which show anomalous changes in the optical response between normal and superconducting states at energies beyond 1 ev in the cuprates @xcite .",
    "but matters came to the forefront when basov and co - workers demonstrated an explicit violation of the single band sum rule for the c - axis optical response of underdoped cuprates @xcite .",
    "since a near neighbor tight binding model should be adequate to describe the hopping along the c - axis , this finding gives direct evidence that the c - axis kinetic energy is lowered in the superconducting state , as suggested by anderson and co - workers @xcite and hirsch as well @xcite .",
    "there has been an alternate interpretation of this observation , though , from ioffe and millis @xcite .",
    "they claim that a `` violation '' is possible for the c - axis response if the normal state reference is taken to be a pseudogap phase involving pairs without long range phase order .",
    "regardless , the c - axis kinetic energy is so small , the energy savings inferred is far below what is needed to account for the actual condensation energy of the cuprates , which is about 3k per cuo plane in optimal doped ybco @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the in - plane kinetic energy is quite large , of order 1 ev .",
    "therefore , if a similar relative violation of the size seen for the c - axis occurs for the in - plane response , then the energy savings could be enough to account for the condensation energy .",
    "motivated by this , two recent experiments on optimal and underdoped bi2212 found evidence for a change in the planar optical integral between normal and superconducting states large enough to account for the condensation energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig51 ] ) @xcite ( though an earlier study of underdoped ybco did not @xcite ) .",
    "= 0.5 = 0.5    no such violation was found for an overdoped bi2212 sample @xcite . in both experiments ,",
    "more spectral weight showed up in the zero frequency condensate peak than can be accounted for by the loss of finite frequency weight up to about 1 ev . integrating up to about 2 ev , though , spectral weight balance is found .",
    "this confirms the earlier speculations by anderson @xcite of transfer of spectral weight from high to low energies .    using the observed form of the scattering rate in the normal state , @xmath200 @xcite , and assuming both of these terms",
    "are gapped below some threshold energy in the superconducting state ( left panel , fig .",
    "[ fig52 ] ) , the optical integral difference was calculated by norman and ppin @xcite ( right panel , fig .",
    "[ fig52 ] ) from an @xmath197 extracted from arpes data ( more properly , band structure values should be used for @xmath201 ) .",
    "they find that such a calculation gives a good estimate of the optical integral change , including its doping dependence .",
    "= 0.8    in these calculations , the sum rule violation is coming from the @xmath202 term ( that is , if the normal state were a pure marginal fermi liquid , there would be no sum rule violation ) .",
    "this @xmath203 term , which as stated earlier seems to be associated with the pseudogap , has a strong dependence on doping ( left panel , fig .",
    "[ fig52 ] ) , which explains the large doping dependence of the sum rule violation .",
    "the same calculations find that the actual kinetic energy change is about twice that indicated by the optical integral , the difference due to the fact that the inverse mass tensor is not simply the negative of @xmath197 as in a near neighbor tight binding model of the energy dispersion . in summary , the origin of the sum rule `` violation '' and kinetic energy lowering can be traced to the formation of quasiparticle peaks in the superconducting state due to the opening of a scattering rate gap .",
    "these results can be generalized by considering the entire free energy .",
    "if only two particle interactions are involved , it is easily shown that the full condensation energy can be written as @xcite @xmath204\\ ] ] where @xmath205 is the normal state single particle spectral function , and @xmath206 that of the superconducting state .",
    "this expression is the sum of two terms , a kinetic energy term ( where @xmath207 is replaced by @xmath208 ) and a potential energy term ( where @xmath207 is replaced by @xmath209 ) .",

    "the first term is related to ( but not the same as ) the optical integral we just discussed , the second term could be obtained from tunneling spectroscopy . both terms ,",
    "though , can in principle be obtained from angle resolved photoemission , since only the occupied states enter . in practice ,",
    "resolution , normalization , and matrix element effects will be a limiting factor @xcite .",
    "the above expressions , though , represent a simple conceptual formalism for tackling the condensation energy issue which avoids the problem of considering complicated two particle correlation functions .",
    "this was illustrated by norman @xcite , who evaluated these expressions using the `` mode '' model of norman and ding ( fig .",
    "[ fig29 ] ) @xcite for fitting arpes spectra ( the same model was employed by ioffe and millis @xcite to analyze the c - axis optical sum rule violation , and norman and ppin @xcite to analyze the in - plane one ) .",
    "what these authors found was that for small normal state scattering rates , a result similar to bcs theory occurs , which presumably applies on the overdoped side of the phase diagram .",
    "for scattering rates much larger than the superconducting energy gap , though , a result opposite to bcs theory was found , in that the kinetic energy was lowered and the potential energy raised in the superconducting state .",

    "there is the bcs effect of particle - hole mixing which raises the kinetic energy .",
    "opposed to this is the formation of coherent quasiparticle states from the incoherent normal state , which acts to lower the kinetic energy . for a small scattering rate ,",

    ", the spectral gap effect wins out and the potential energy is lowered , whereas for large scattering rate , the weight transfer effect wins out and the potential energy is raised .",
    "what this implies for the phase diagram is that on the overdoped side , one expects more or less bcs like physics .",
    "but on the underdoped side , one expects dramatic departures .",
    "in particular , the potential energy is lowered across the pseudogap @xmath128 line due to the formation of a spectral gap , then the kinetic energy lowered across the superconducting @xmath119 line due to the onset of coherence .",
