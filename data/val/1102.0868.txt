    "the current obliquity of mars is chaotic with a lyapunov time scale of 5  myr ( laskar & robutel , 1993 ; touma & wisdom , 1993 ) .",
    "this has drastic consequences for the martian climate . at present , the obliquity is a modest 25@xmath0 , the average polar insolation is lower than the equatorial one ( ward , 1974 ) and ice caps are observed at the poles of the planet .",
    "however , during phases where the obliquity is high , @xmath1 , large quantities of polar ice sublimate and could be transported to the tropical regions ( jakosky & carr , 1985 ; jakosky et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "on shorter time scales the martian obliquity suffers large - amplitude oscillations of approximately 22@xmath0 around a mean value of 25@xmath0 with a period of 125  kyr ( ward , 1974 ) , caused by the perturbations on its orbit from the other terrestrial planets .",
    "these large - amplitude oscillations drive large - scale variations in its seasonal cycles of water , carbon dioxide and dust ( e.g. kieffer & zent , 1992 ) .",
    "in addition , the large obliquity changes cause frequent ice ages on mars , during which there is a build - up of polar ice towards the equator ( head et al , 2003 ) .",
    "the planet is currently in an interglacial period having suffered an ice age approximately 1  myr ago when the obliquity reached over 30@xmath0 ( head et al , 2003 ) . over the past 10  myr the mean obliquity",
    "has decreased from approximately 35@xmath0 to its current value of 25@xmath0 ( touma & wisdom , 1993 ; laskar et al . 2002 ) , indicating that past ice ages may have lasted much longer .",
    "+ however , the conditions on mars were very different shortly after its formation compared to what they are today . during the noachian period , which lasted from mars formation until 3.5  gyr ago , there is evidence for a short existence of liquid water during its later stages ( e.g. carr , 1996 ; christensen et al . , 2001 ) , a temporary magnetic field ( lillis et al . , 2008 ) and possibly a thick atmosphere with the temperature at the surface exceeding 273  k.",
    "the existence of ubiquitous valley networks has led to the idea that fluvial erosion was an important process on noachian mars ( carr , 1996 ) .",
    "however , christensen et al . ( 2001 ) argue that the duration of liquid water flow must have been brief because of the existence of olivine and lack of carbonates at the surface.by the end of the noachian , the bulk of the valley networks had formed and the erosion rate was steeply declining ( carr , 1996 ) .",
    "in addition , the magnetic field might have protected the atmosphere from pick - up - ion sputtering and hydrodynamic collisions , and therefore knowledge of its evolution is crucial for understanding the noachian climate history .",
    "isotopic evidence in martian meteorite alh84001 suggests that the atmosphere was largely unfractionated near the end of the noachian ( marti et al . , 2001 ;",
    "mathew & marti , 2001 ) .",
    "the geologic and isotopic information taken together suggests a relatively rapid loss of atmosphere as mars entered the hesperian era  which lasted from 3.5  gyr ago to 1.8  gyr ago .",
    "loss of a global magnetic field has been considered as an attractive mechanism , but this probably happened much earlier ( lillis et al , 2008 ) .",
    "+ the end of the noachian age corresponds approximately with the beginning of the lunar cataclysm or late heavy bombardment ( lhb ) .",
    "this episode of intense cratering on the moon ( tera et al . , 1974 ) , and the other terrestrial planets , occurring some 3.8  gyr ago , formed some of the basins on the moon , notably imbrium and orientale .",
    "the cratering intensity was dramatically higher than what is predicted from the remnants of planet formation ( bottke et al . , 2007 ) , suggesting a major re - ordering event in the solar system .",
    "indeed , the lhb is believed to be the last major event that sculpted the solar system ( strom et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "the lhb is also thought to be linked with a dynamical instability in the outer solar system , which resulted in a reshuffling of giant planet orbits ( gomes et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "this dynamical instability also affected the orbits of the terrestrial planets and probably created their current orbital structure ( brasser et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "these models favour a fast migration of jupiter and saturn , resulting in a short - lived , high - eccentricity phase after a long spell of circular orbits ( brasser et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "recent results have uncovered that the orbits of the giant planets were likely less dynamically excited ( lower eccentricities and inclinations ) , and that they were much closer together ( morbidelli et al .",
    "however , for this study we shall not limit ourselves to this one particular case , but explore a wider range of possible configurations .",
    "unfortunately , the orbits of the terrestrial planets before the lhb are unknown , but there is a range of possible solutions .",
    "therefore we create a set of different terrestrial planet systems with a wide range of initial conditions , and determine the influence of their perturbations on the obliquity evolution of mars using numerical simulations .",
    "the simulations are inspected for cases where the obliquity could be stable on long time scales .",
    "+ this paper proceeds as follows .",
    "section  2 contains a short presentation of the equations of motion of the obliquity of mars , and the typical values of the quantities that enter these equations .",
    "section  3 contains a description of our numerical methods . in section  4",
    "we present our results , and the last section contains our conclusions .",
    "the evolution of the obliquity of a planet subject to perturbations from other planets has been studied by various authors ( e.g. colombo , 1966 ; ward , 1974 ; kinoshita , 1977 ; laskar et al . ,",
    "1993 ; ward & hamilton , 2004 ) .",
    "here we give a short summary based on the elegant method of nron de surgy & laskar ( 1997 ) .",
    "+ mars figure exhibits precession of the equinoxes , similar to earth .",
    "the precession is caused by mars figure being slightly flattened , so that there is a normal component to the force exerted on mars by the sun .",
    "this component of the force induces a torque on mars that drives the precession and which acts in the direction opposite to mars orbital motion .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the torque on mars is ( nron de surgy & laskar , 1997 )    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the rotational angular momentum of mars , @xmath4 is mars largest moment of inertia , @xmath5 is its rotation rate , @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the obliquity .",
    "the precession of the equinox , @xmath8 , is governed by the parameter @xmath9 as @xmath10 where    @xmath11    here @xmath12 is mars quadrupole moment , @xmath13 is mars orbital mean motion , @xmath14 is mars radius , @xmath15 is its mass , @xmath16 is the semi - major axis and @xmath17 is the eccentricity . for simplicity we will set @xmath18 and thus @xmath19 .",
    "the most recent data for the figure , obliquity , equinox and orbit of mars are taken from folkner et al .",

    "@xmath27  @xmath28/yr and thus @xmath29  @xmath28/yr .",
    "+ however , the orbit of mars is not static but undergoes periodic changes induced by perturbations from the other planets .",
    "when taking these perturbations into account , the ecliptic is no longer an inertial plane and thus the kinetic energy of its forcing , @xmath30 , has to be added to the hamiltonian ( kinoshita , 1977 ) .",

    "@xmath35 is the inclination of the orbit of mars with respect to the invariable plane of the solar system and @xmath36 is its longitude of the ascending node .",
    "the new hamiltonian is then @xmath37 , and hamilton s equations are    @xmath38 ; \\quad \\dot{\\psi}= -\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{k}}{\\partial x } = \\alpha x - x(1-x^2)^{-1/2}[a(t)\\sin \\psi + b(t ) \\cos \\psi]-2\\gamma(t).\\ ] ]    here @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the forcing terms from the planetary perturbations on the orbit of mars .",
    "equations ( [ spineq ] ) are singular when @xmath42 i.e. when @xmath43 , so for numerical integrations we follow laskar et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and use @xmath44 , which yields    @xmath45 ; \\quad \\dot{\\eta } = -b(t)\\sqrt{1-\\xi^2-\\eta^2 } + \\xi[\\alpha \\sqrt{1-\\xi^2-\\eta^2 } -2\\gamma(t ) ] .",
    "\\label{spineqreg}\\ ] ]    equations ( [ spineqreg ] ) contain no singularities .",
    "now that we have outlined the basic equations of motion of the spin axis , we turn to our numerical methods .",
    "unlike laskar et al . ( 2004 ) , our aim is not to obtain an accurate prediction of the future evolution of the obliquity of mars , but rather to test its stability as a function of varying initial conditions : different orbits of the terrestrial planets and a range of original obliquities .",
    "thus we integrate the equations of motion of the obliquity of mars ( [ spineqreg ] ) from existing simulations of the solar system .",
    "this is described below .",
    "* we perform simulations of the solar system with various initial conditions of the giant planets and the terrestrial planets ( see next section ) for 265 myr with a time step of 0.01 yr ( 3.6525 days ) .",
    "the data is output every 1000  yr .",
    "we use the 2nd order mvs integrator of laskar & robutel ( 2001 ) , implemented ( bro et al . , 2005 ) in the swift integration package ( levison & duncan , 1994 ) .",
    "the code includes digital filtering of the orbital elements using kaiser windows ( kaiser , 1966 ) , based on the method of quinn et al .",

    "the first is caused by a resonance overlap between the precession of mars figure and two eigenfrequencies of the solar system .",
    "the other is a secular resonance between the orbits of mercury , venus and jupiter , which indirectly affects the orbit of mars .",
    "we shall examine each of these below .",
    "+ usually the relation @xmath52 is a good approximation for the precession rate with increasing obliquity . for mars , however , as the obliquity increases there are two values where @xmath57 i.e. a secular spin - orbit resonance occurs .",
    "the first resonance is with @xmath58 at @xmath59 .",
    "the second is with @xmath55 at @xmath60 .",
    "the width of these two resonances is directly proportional to the forcing on mars orbit from mercury and venus . in the current solar system",
    "the forcing from both planets is so large that these resonances overlap , which occurs at @xmath61 .",
    "resonance overlap is a source of chaos ( chirikov , 1979 ) , which accounts for the chaotic region between initial obliquities of 30@xmath0 and 60@xmath0 .",
    "however , there is a second source of chaos that affects the obliquity , which arises from chaos in the orbit of mars .",
    "+ laskar ( 1990 ) identified two sources of chaos in the orbits of the terrestrial planets .",
    "the one that affects mars obliquity has the argument @xmath62 , which is currently in libration with period 10  myr ( laskar , 1990 ) . here",
    "@xmath63 are the eigenfrequencies of the longitudes of pericentre , corresponding to the proper precession frequencies of the perihelia of mercury ( @xmath64 ) to neptune ( @xmath65 ) ( brouwer & van woerkom , 1950 ) .",
    "the argument @xmath66 stays in libration for the next 200  myr , but its amplitude changes , implying the motion is near a separatrix .",
    "laskar ( 1990 ) showed that the components associated with @xmath55 and @xmath58 in mars orbit are accompanied by a number of smaller components of similar frequency .",
    "a multiplet of components can also be viewed as a single component with varying frequency and amplitude , with the frequency of the multiplet being comparable to the frequency spread of the multiplet .",
    "these multiplets are caused by the presence of the secular resonance @xmath67 .",
    "thus in the fourier spectrum of mars orbit the lines associated with @xmath55 and @xmath58 are not clean delta functions but exhibit a near - gaussian profile i.e. they have significant sidebands .",
    "this is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ oblcurr ] and the profiles overlap .",
    "these mutiplets effect the motion of the mean obliquity because @xmath8 can resonate with all these additional frequencies in the multiplets .",
    "the mean obliquity pops in and out of resonance because the location of the separatrix varies with time .",
    "the crossing of the separatrix occurs at essentially random phase which causes the obliquity to increase or decrease at random , and thus the mean obliquity exhibits something akin to a random walk .",
    "the secular resonance acts when the mean obliquity @xmath68 .",
    "this implies that the mean obliquity is chaotic from 0@xmath0 to 60@xmath0 on gyr time scales ( laskar & robutel , 1993 ; laskar et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "+ from the above it appears there are two ways the obliquity of mars can be stabilised .",
    "the first is to reduce the forcing from mercury and venus on mars so that the two resonances no longer overlap .",
    "this can be achieved by reducing the eccentricities and inclinations of the terrestrial planets .",
    "there is indication that the terrestrial planets were situated on dynamically colder orbits before the lhb ( brasser et al , 2009 ) .",
    "the second method is to change the precession frequencies of either mercury , venus or jupiter and break the resonance @xmath67 .",
    "there are no indications that the terrestrial planets had their orbits changed significantly , but there is plenty of evidence that jupiter had migrated ( e.g. fernndez & ip , 1984 ; malhotra , 1993 ; tsiganis et al . , 2005 ; morbidelli et al . , 2007 , 2009 , 2010 ; brasser et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "displacing jupiter would change the value of @xmath69 and if increased enough it will break the secular resonance .",
    "the effect of removing this resonance on the obliquity of mars , while keeping everything else the same , is discussed in the next subsection .      here",
    "we investigate the effect of a different configuration of the giant planets on the obliquity evolution of mars .",
    "it was almost certain that the giant planets had different orbits before the lhb , so it is essential to study the stability of mars obliquity using other configurations of the giant planets .",
    "we look for a system that increases @xmath69 so that the resonance @xmath67 is not in libration .",
    "+ the value of @xmath69 depends mostly on the separation between jupiter and saturn i.e. on their period ratio @xmath70 .",
    "brasser et al . (",
    "2009 ) showed that when @xmath71 , @xmath69 decreases sharply as @xmath70 increases : from approximately 20@xmath28/yr when @xmath72 to its current value of 4.26@xmath28/yr when @xmath73 .",
    "as @xmath70 increases and @xmath69 decreases , it crosses the values of @xmath74/yr and @xmath75/yr when @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively . in order not to destabilise the terrestrial system we need @xmath78 and thus @xmath79 .",
    "there are several well - studied models in the literature that prefer an initial period ratio between jupiter and saturn @xmath79 .",
    "these are the model of malhotra ( 1993 ) , the nice model of tsiganis et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and the resonant model of morbidelli et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . here",
    "we use the configuration of malhotra ( 1993 ) , since it has the most relaxed initial conditions for the giant planets : the initial period ratio is @xmath80 and the giant planets have their current inclinations and eccentricities .",
    "the terrestrial planets remained on their current orbits .",
    "+    figure  [ oblrenu ] shows the result of numerical simulations using malhotra s planets .",
    "the layout is exactly the same as fig .",
    "[ oblcurr ] , and there are some significant differences .",
    "first the chaotic region is much narrower . in the current solar system",
    "the chaotic region ranges from 10@xmath0 to 60@xmath0 , though from 0 to 60@xmath0 on longer time scale ( laskar & robutel , 1993 ; laskar et al . , 2004 ) . in fig .",
    "[ oblrenu ] , the chaotic region is confined to @xmath50 from 35@xmath0 to 60@xmath0 .",
    "the chaos from the secular resonance @xmath67 has disappeared because @xmath81 .",
    "the only source of chaos is the overlap of the two resonances @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "this can be inferred from the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ oblrenu ] : the lines around @xmath55 and @xmath58 are much narrower than in fig .",
    "[ oblcurr ] , implying a cleaner spectrum and thus a periodic signal instead of a chaotic one .",
    "the obliquity can no longer resonate with all the intermediate frequencies and the chaos is confined to the main resonances . by increasing @xmath69 and breaking the resonance @xmath67 the regions of initial obliquity with values below 35@xmath0 and above 60@xmath0 are stable , though the amplitude of oscillation is still large .",
    "this could be reduced if the terrestrial planets were dynamically colder , which is discussed in the next subsection .",
    "here we examine the stability of the obliquity of mars in a solar system where the orbits of the terrestrial planets are dynamically colder .",
    "+ the orbits of the terrestrial planets prior to the lhb can not be obtained in similar fashion to those of the giant planets : the former were formed by solid body accretion over 100  myr time scales well after the gas disc dissipated ( e.g. raymond et al .",
    "their original orbital configuration was determined by the stochastic process of planetary embryo collision and accretion .",
    "studies of the dynamical instability responsible for the lhb , likely caused by giant planet scattering which caused a large semi - major axis jump for jupiter ( brasser et al .",
    ", 2009 ; morbidelli et al . ,",
    "2010 ) , can not determine the exact effect this would have on the orbits of the terrestrial planets individually , so we study them as a system .",
    "one useful metric is the angular momentum deficit ( amd ; laskar , 1997 ) , which measures the deviation of the terrestrial system from circular and coplanar orbits , and is given by ( laskar , 1997 )    @xmath84    where @xmath85 is the mass of each planet mercury to mars in solar masses , the semi - major axes @xmath86 are measured in au and the inclinations @xmath87 are with respect to the invariable plane .",

    ", we chose to place the giant planets on the resonant , circular configuration of morbidelli et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , to remove any forcing from the giants on the terrestrials .",
    "it is assumed that the dynamical instability that caused the lhb would only excite the terrestrial planets , thus increasing their amd to its current value .",
    "we have tested this assumption by performing simulations in which we subjected the terrestrial planets on random orbits with pre - assigned amd values to a so - called jumping jupiter scenario ( brasser et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "we consistently find an amd increase of @xmath89 1 and that the increase is systematic , suggesting that the primordial amd was most likely lower than its current value .",
    "this can be argued as follows . during the instability",
    "jupiter suddenly appears on an orbit that is closer to the terrestrials and more eccentric , and remains there .",
    "this adds a forcing to the eccentricities of the terrestrials , whose amplitude depends on the eccentricity of jupiter and the semi - major axis ratio between jupiter and the terrestrials .",
    "thus the eccentricities of the terrestrial planets , and thus the amd , experience a systematic increase .",
    "therefore we take the upper limit of the primordial amd equal to 1 and focus our discussion on values closer to 0 .",
