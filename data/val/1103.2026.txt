    "symmetry and symmetry breaking play important roles in elementary particle physics . according to the noether s theorem ,",
    "if a system is invariant under a continue global transformation , there is a conserved current corresponding to this transformation . although the noether s theorem is an exact one , it comes into exist at the classical level .",
    "sometimes the consequences of the noether s theorem are violated by quantum corrections and are related with anomaly .",
    "a well known example of anomaly is the chiral anomaly which is due to adler , bell and jackiw  @xcite . in the evaluation of the anomaly ,",
    "an unavoidable procedure is to regularize the loop integrals , therefore a gauge symmetry - preserving regularization is crucial for the calculation of quantum correction induced anomaly .",
    "meanwhile , a calculation of quantum correction induced anomaly provides a useful laboratory for the check of the consistence of a new regularization prescription .",
    "recently , a new regularization scheme named loop regularization was proposed@xcite .",
    "it has been explicitly proved at one - loop level that the loop regularization can preserve the non - ableian gauge symmetry  @xcite as well as supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "adopting such a symmetry - preserving loop regularization , we have studied the chiral anomaly systematically  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the two scales in the loop regularization , uv scale @xmath0 and ir scale @xmath1 , play important roles in understanding the chiral anomaly . under the condition",
    "@xmath5 which is applicable for the renormalizability of qed and a symmetrical treatment of all the three currents , the chiral anomaly in the massless qed can consistently be obtained in case of @xmath3 , while the massless qed could be free from anomaly if keeping @xmath6 . for the massive qed",
    ", the chiral anomaly can be obtained with @xmath3 , while if taking @xmath7 , the chiral anomaly would also be absent . in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on the loop regularization method , the radiatively induced lorentz and cpt violating chern - simons term in qed was calculated and a consistent result is obtained when simultaneously combining the evaluation for the chiral anomaly with ensuring the vector current conserved . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the loop regularization method has been applied to study the gauge theory coupled to gravitation .    in this paper , we will focus on another well - known anomaly , namely trace anomaly , which causes the violation of the dilation ward identity due to the scaling invariance .",
    "the trace anomaly problem was firstly studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in the framework of scalar field theory , and it was subsequently analyzed in various aspects  @xcite . in this paper , we shall calculate the trace anomaly in the framework of qed by using the symmetry - preserving loop regularization  @xcite . since the standard form of the trace anomaly in qed is known , for example ref .",
    "@xcite , our study can be regarded as a further independent check of the consistency of the loop regularization prescription .",
    "this comes to our main purpose in the present paper .",
    "we shall show that with the symmetry - preserving loop regularization one can obtain the standard form of the trace anomaly when taking @xmath8 and @xmath3 , which is required for recovering the original feynman loop integrals and also applicable to qed as it is a renormalizable and ir divergence free theory .",
    "it is also seen that the consistency conditions relating the tensor type and the scalar type irreducible loop integrals , which have been verified in the loop regularization method , are crucial for the anomaly evaluation . from our explicit calculations ,",
    "we arrive at the conclusion again that the loop regularization is indeed a consistent symmetry - preserving regularization .",
