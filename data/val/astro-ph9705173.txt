    "the evolutionary population synthesis ( eps ) technique , first introduced by tinsley ( 1968 ; see @xcite and @xcite for review ) , has its fundamental basis in stellar evolution theory . unlike the static population synthesis technique ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ;",
    "see @xcite for review ) that adopts physical constraints from the observational data , eps relies on theoretical constraints , most importantly the evolutionary time scale of stars .",
    "some significant advantages of eps include the following : ( 1 ) the theoretical results can provide physical understanding @xmath1 the results fit the observations reasonably because the solution is unique , ( 2 ) it allows us to understand not only the present observable quantities but also the evolution of those quantities , ( 3 ) it is easy to implement the theoretical predictions into the code , and ( 4 ) it is easier to investigate the sensitivity of the result to input assumptions that are used in the modeling . while aspects ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) have been widely recognized , the significance of aspects ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) is still poorly understood .",
    "as an example of aspect ( 3 ) , eps enables us to include hypothetical stars that are predicted to exist and significant contributors to the integrated flux but rarely observed .",
    "for instance , several stellar evolution theory groups have predicted that , under certain conditions , low mass core helium - burning stars ( horizontal branch - hb - stars ) become uv - bright before they become white dwarf ( wd ) stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; horch , demarque , & pinsonneault 1992 ) .",
    "these uv - bright stars , the so - called slow blue phase ( sbp ) stars ( @xcite ) which include both agb - manqu stars ( @xcite ) and post - early - agb ( peagb , @xcite ) stars , can be realistically taken into account only through the eps technique .",
    "yi , demarque , & kim ( 1997 , hereafter ydk ) provided a detailed physical description of the uv - bright phase .    on the other hand ,",
    "the reliability of eps is restricted by uncertainty in the stellar physics .",
    "the sbp stars give an example again .",
    "they were unknown until recently .",
    "thus , early eps studies were not able to include them , despite their probable significance in the uv study .",
    "however , such pure theoretical predictions from stellar astrophysics may not be realistic : such stars may not exist",
    ". then , the eps using such theoretical constraints would result in wrong conclusions .",
    "therefore , in earlier times when many of the stellar evolutionary phenomena other than the main sequence ( ms ) and red giant branch ( rgb ) were unclear , the static population synthesis technique was more popular .",
    "however , there has been remarkable progress in the advanced stellar evolution theory during the past few decades , especially for the core helium - burning phase ( e.g. @xcite ; sweigart , mengel , & demarque 1974 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; dorman , rood , & oconnell 1993 ; @xcite ; ydk ) . therefore , many groups are now including advanced phases of stellar evolution in eps ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; bressan , chiosi , & fagotto 1994 ; @xcite ; dorman , oconnell , & rood 1995 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "many of them are mainly aiming at solving the `` uv upturn problem '' , where the uv upturn is defined as the increasing flux in the uv ( 1,000  2,500  ) with decreasing wavelength , as found in giant elliptical galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the most serious concern about such elaborate population studies is that the effects of input parameters on the resulting uv flux are very poorly understood . unlike population synthesis in the optical band ,",
    "uv population synthesis for old stellar systems , such as elliptical galaxies , is very sensitive to various detailed physical assumptions .",
    "this is because most candidates for uv sources are highly evolved stars whose properties are governed by several input parameters that have not yet been determined very well . among such parameters",
    "are mass loss and its distribution , galactic helium enrichment ( @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4 ) , and initial mass function .",
    "in particular , as we will show later , the assumptions about mass loss and its distribution influence the magnitude of the resulting uv flux significantly .",
    "many recent population synthesis studies have been presented to the readers without addressing the sensitivity of their results and conclusions to alterations in the adopted input parameters .",
    "the main goals of this paper are to illustrate the sensitivity of the model uv spectrum to various input parameters , and to investigate the plausibility of uv - bright core helium - burning stars as the major uv sources in giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "this paper complements previous works in the literature .",
    "greggio & renzini ( 1990 ) explored the sensitivity of the uv modeling to @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4and to the metallicity - dependence of mass loss .",
    "the effects of age and metallicity have been investigated by several groups , among which the works of bressan et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , dorman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and tantalo et al .",
    "( 1996 ) are noteworthy . although these groups and others ( most notably the empirical works done by the hut team ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have tested the plausibility of core helium - burning stars as the main uv sources in giant elliptical galaxies before , we found it necessary to investigate it within a fuller parameter space , in those cases where several input parameters influence are still poorly known .",
    "realistic synthetic hb , based on gaussian mass dispersion on the hb , has been used in our population synthesis .",
    "although park & lee ( 1997 ) used the same technique in their recent study for the first time , ours is the first to combine the mass loss as a function of age and metallicity and gaussian mass dispersion .",
    "we will show why realistic hb treatment is important .",
    "we also would like to demonstrate that intricate astrophysics must be considered in estimating mass loss and in incorporating the estimates into the population synthesis code , even for the most simplistic approach ( e.g. reimers mass loss formula ) .    in order to distinguish the effects of these input parameters from others , all the models in this paper",
    "are based on simple model populations in which all stars are born at the same time with the same chemical composition .",
    "_ this study focuses on the sensitivity of the uv modeling to the adopted input parameters , and , thus , does not include a detailed comparison between models and observational data . _ the following paper ( yi , demarque , & oemler 1997 ) in the series is mainly dedicated to such comparisons .",
    "an obvious source of uncertainty in eps is the stellar spectral library used to convert the theoretical quantities ( such as @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and radius @xmath7 ) into observable ones ( e.g. magnitudes , colors and spectral line strengths ) ( charlot , worthey , & bressan 1996 ) .",
    "galaxy models have been based on either empirical stellar spectral libraries which are highly incomplete in the super metal - rich ( @xmath8 @xmath9 ) regime and lack uv data , or on theoretical libraries that do not reproduce observed stellar spectra precisely , and have not been fully verified empirically at uv wavelengths .",
    "there are several comprehensive empirical libraries ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) in the optical through near - infrared ( ir ) bands , and they have been used in many population synthesis studies . in general , they are adequate for ms through rgb stars and in the solar abundance regime .",
    "however , elliptical galaxies are believed to be metal - rich , and no adequate empirical library exists for super metal - rich ( @xmath8 @xmath9 ) stars .",
    "in particular , the lack of empirical spectra of evolved , metal - rich stars , such as sbp ( slow blue phase ) stars , is a serious drawback for uv studies .",
    "the best uv spectral library is derived from iue observations ( fanelli , oconnell , & thuan 1987 ; @xcite ) ; however , it lacks super metal - rich ( @xmath10 @xmath9 ) samples , and does not cover the far uv near the @xmath11 limit that is crucial to the uv upturn study .    on the other hand , theoretical spectral libraries suffer from insufficient atomic data and physical understanding .",
    "even the most recent models may be inadequate , especially for cool stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these theoretical libraries have to be validated by acquiring as much empirical data as possible .",
    "but , the validation in the uv wavelength is possible only using the space facilities which have limited and competitive observing time .",
    "while both empirical and theoretical libraries have problems , a great advantage of using the theoretical spectral library is that we can clearly see the effects of various parameters , such as temperature , metallicity , and surface gravity , in the models .",
    "moreover , the recent kurucz library covers the high metallicities and high temperatures that are crucial to highly evolved stars and thus to uv studies , but that are not available empirically .",
    "thus , a theoretical library has been chosen , assuming that the uncertainty in the model spectra is still smaller than the effects of temperature and metallicity that can not be studied adequately using empirical libraries .",
    "the foundation of the spectral library in this study is the kurucz library ( 1992 ) .",
    "it covers @xmath12\\,$]= @xmath134  @xmath141 , @xmath5= 3,500  50,000 k , and @xmath6= 0.0  5.0 ( see kurucz ( 1992 ) for details of the grids ) .",
    "additional spectra have been constructed for the stars with high @xmath5and / or high @xmath6using the 1995 version of the hubeny spectral synthesis code , tlusty178 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the effects of @xmath5and metallicity are demonstrated in figures 1  2 .",
    "since the metallicity effects are small when @xmath5@xmath15 50,000 k , all models for @xmath5@xmath10 50,000 k have been constructed for @xmath16 = @xmath9 .",
    "the stellar spectrum for each star is constructed using linear interpolation in metallicity and surface gravity . however , for @xmath5 , the population synthesis code finds the model spectrum with the closest temperature in the library instead of interpolating in the temperature grid in order to save cpu time .",
    "for example , the code will use model spectra of @xmath5= 3,500 k and 3,750 k for the stars of @xmath5= 3,400 k and 3,650 k. this approach slightly overestimates the contribution from such cool stars in the composite spectrum in the ir because the minimum @xmath5 in the kurucz library is 3,500 k. however , this effect is negligible in the uv and optical range because only a small number of stars are that cool and such cool stars contribute little to the integrated light in the uv to optical range .",
    "eps consists of two steps , constructing model color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and spectral energy distributions ( seds ) . it will be shown later in this study that a careful synthetic cmd construction including a realistic hb is crucial , especially for uv population synthesis .",
    "the model cmd provides basic information , such as @xmath12\\,$ ] , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and the radius of the star @xmath7 . since a model stellar spectrum is defined only by @xmath12\\,$ ]",
    ", @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath17,\\,t_{eff},\\,\\log\\,g,\\ , r),\\ ] ] the convolution of this information with the spectral library generates a model composite spectrum .    the core helium - burning phase in the population synthesis requires a complicated treatment involving a synthetic hb construction .",
    "therefore the core hydrogen - burning phase ( ms and rgb ) and the core helium - burning phase - strictly speaking , post - rgb : hb , asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , slow blue phase ( sbp ) , post - agb ( pagb ) , and white dwarf ( wd ) - have been dealt with separately .",
    "then , the total flux @xmath18is the sum of the flux from the core hydrogen - burning stars @xmath19 and that from the core helium - burning stars @xmath20    @xmath21    the foundations of the model cmd construction are the yale isochrones 1996 ( @xcite ) and yi et al.s post - rgb tracks ( ydk ) .",
    "the core hydrogen - burning phase is relatively easier to deal with because both ms and rgb are well understood .",
    "the yale isochrones 1996 provides all the necessary information of the core - hydrogen burning stars for the population synthesis .",
    "the initial mass function ( imf ) is assumed to follow a conventional power law as follows , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the stellar mass , @xmath24 is the number of stars in the @xmath25th mass bin , @xmath26 is a normalization constant , and @xmath27 is the imf slope .",
    "three values of @xmath27 , namely -1 , 1.35 , and 3 , are chosen to see the effects of imf on the model cmds and seds ; the models with @xmath28 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) are considered to be standard .",
    "the flux from all the core hydrogen - burning stars , on the ms and rgb , @xmath19 , is @xmath29 where @xmath30    the normalization constant @xmath26 has been set to make the mass of the model galaxy @xmath31  @xmath32 .",
    "this large number avoids any stochastic effect from rare bright stars .",
    "one of the nice features of the population synthesis of giant elliptical galaxies is that giant elliptical galaxies are composed of a sufficiently large number of stars that we can avoid a serious stochastic effect where statistical fluctuations of a few bright stars can influence the sed . on the contrary",
    ", population synthesis for small galaxies and star clusters suffers from the stochastic effect .",
    "therefore , such studies must be approached with caution .",
    "mass loss is one of the most important , but least understood processes in stellar astrophysics .",
    "it has a dominant influence on the uv evolution of galaxies because the mass loss determines the mean @xmath5of core helium - burning stars that are the major uv sources in old stellar systems , as will be shown later .",
    "reimers empirical formula of mass loss ( @xcite ) @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the luminosity , @xmath35 is the surface gravity , and @xmath7 is the radius , has been used in this study .",
    "the mass loss efficiency parameter , @xmath36 , an empirical fitting factor , was originally chosen to be unity based on the study of 16 metal - rich ( population i ) red giant stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xmath36 has been reported to vary remarkably from 0.25 to 2  3 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . while the estimated @xmath36 for metal - rich stars",
    "varies significantly , the estimated range of @xmath36 for metal - poor stars seems to be much better determined .",
    "most studies on metal - poor stars suggest @xmath36 = 0.3  0.6 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; lee , demarque , & zinn 1994 )",
    ".    one of the best ways to estimate the mass loss in metal - poor stars uses the fact that the mass of the rr lyrae variables ( a type of hb star ) and the mass of the red giants can be determined independently . in principle",
    ", the mass loss on the rgb can be deduced from the mass difference between red giants and hb stars . however , a precise , empirical mass estimation of ordinary hb stars is difficult to achieve .",
    "several pulsation studies showed that the mass of a particular type of rr lyrae stars ( rr - d double mode variables ) can be reasonably estimated ( @xcite ) .",
    "the mass of rr lyrae stars can also be measured via stellar evolution theory by fitting the observed hb morphology with synthetic hbs ( yi , lee , & demarque 1993 ) . for a long time",
    ", there existed an inconsistency between the evolutionary mass of rr lyrae variables and their pulsation mass , in the sense that the pulsation masses were lower ( petersen 1973 ; lee , demarque & zinn 1990 ) .",
    "this discrepancy raised doubts in the minds of many variable star researchers about the validity of the hb evolutionary models ( e.g. clement , kinman , & suntzeff 1991 ) .",
    "accordingly , the true mass loss on the rgb was unclear .",
    "however , the mass estimates from the two independent methods are now in good agreement when improved physics including the opal opacities is used ( kovacs , buchler , & marom 1991 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "because of this agreement , we can reasonably estimate the amount of mass loss experienced by the red giant progenitors of double mode rr lyrae stars , once the masses of red giants are provided .",
    "the masses of the red giants as a function of age and chemical composition can be reliably deduced from the stellar evolution theory .    in order to redetermine @xmath36 for metal - poor stars in this study",
    ", we adopted the evolutionary mass of rr lyrae stars in metal - poor globular clusters , m15 ( @xmath16 = 0.0001 ) and m3 ( @xmath16 = 0.0004 ) , from yi et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and the mass of red giants from the yale isochrones 1996 .",
    "it should be emphasized that @xmath36 estimation based on the hb morphology , that is , on the mass estimates of rr lyrae stars , must use the new mass estimates of rr lyrae stars after the rr lyrae mass discrepancy has been removed . if the old , lower mass is used , the @xmath36 would be overestimated by almost a factor of two .",
    "the mass loss ( table 1  4 ) has been calculated using reimers formula which is applied to ms  rgb stellar evolutionary tracks that have been constructed without mass loss .",
    "several evolutionary tracks of different masses were selected for the mass loss estimation in order to approximately cover the range of 1  25  gyr of age .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath16 = 0.02 ( @xmath37 @xmath9 ) , the tracks of 1.8  @xmath32(lifetime on the ms ",
    "rgb @xmath37 1.3  gyr ) , 1.4  @xmath32 ( 3.3  gyr ) , 1.0  @xmath32(11.1  gyr ) , and 0.8  @xmath32(31.5  gyr ) were used to estimate the mass loss at 1.3 , 3.3 , 11.1 , and 31.5  gyr , and linear interpolation was carried out within this age range . therefore , in a 10 billion years old stellar system with ( @xmath16 , @xmath3 ) = ( 0.02 , 0.27 ) where most stars on the ms through rgb are slightly heavier than @xmath38@xmath32 , reimers formula suggests that stars experience mass loss of about 0.119 ( if @xmath39 ) ",
    "0.396  @xmath32(if @xmath40 ) ( see the second top left panel in figure 4 and table 1  4 ) depending on the adopted @xmath36 .",
    "we assume the mass loss becomes noticeable when @xmath41 @xmath42 .",
    "also , the mass loss has been forced to stop in the numerical calculations either when the star reaches the helium core flash stage or when it causes the envelope mass @xmath43to be smaller than 0.01  @xmath32(as the star loses mass and as the core mass @xmath44grows ) .",
    "it has been suggested that @xmath43cannot be infinitesimally small ( @xcite ) for the following reason .",
    "a certain mass is required to be present in the stellar envelope in order to exert sufficient gravitational pressure on the degenerate core of an rgb star and to cause a helium core flash ( we call this @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath43@xmath47 ) .",
    "this is how hb stars are born .",
    "it is believed that nearly all the energy produced by the helium core flash is consumed in removing the degeneracy of the core and that there is not enough energy to expel any significant amount of envelope material into space ( @xcite ; @xcite ; cole , demarque , & deupree 1985 ) . the minimum @xmath43has been suggested to be approximately 0.01 ",
    "0.02  @xmath32(hayashi , hoshi , & sugimoto 1962 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is still debatable whether such a minimum @xmath43exists considering that there are hot ( low - mass ) field subdwarf stars ( see @xcite for review ) and low - mass uv - bright stars in ngc6791 ( @xcite ; liebert , saffer , & green 1994 ; @xcite ) that seem to have an envelope of @xmath43@xmath48 0.01  @xmath32 .",
    "in particular , dcruz et al .",
    "( 1996 ) recently suggested that such a minimum @xmath43does not exist .",
    "instead , they claimed that red giants with a very smaller envelope mass experience helium - core flash after leaving the tip of the rgb quietly .",
    "we do not include such models in this paper , but we believe that their finding is quite plausible and deserves further investigations both to verify it with thorough theoretical calculations and to explore the effect of it to the population synthesis . while the value of the minimum @xmath43is not yet clear , 0.01  @xmath32has been chosen in this study in order to approximately accommodate the hot stars in ngc6791 and the hot field subdwarf stars .",
    "much of the mass loss is believed to occur during the bright phase of the rgb because it is sensitive to the stellar radius @xmath7 , and @xmath7 increases dramatically as a red giant evolves along the rgb .",
    "if the minimum @xmath43hypothesis is removed , a larger mass loss would be allowed for some stars and the synthetic hb would contain hotter stars .",
    "however , the absence of such hot hb stars in galactic globular clusters in general supports the minimum @xmath43hypothesiscen ) , only a few of such hot stars are believed to have an @xmath43smaller than 0.01  @xmath32 .",
    "if such hot stars with @xmath43@xmath49 0.01  @xmath32are remnants of the single stellar evolution , they may provide counterexamples to the minimum @xmath43 hypothesis . however , very low mass envelope hb stars might instead be created by mass transfer in binary systems ( mengel , norris & gross 1976 ) , or by close interactions in dense parts of globular clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we have considered only the evolution of single , non - interacting stars . ] .",
    "table 5 lists the estimated mass of the rr lyrae variables @xmath50 , the mass of the rgb stars at the tip @xmath51 , and the best fitting @xmath36 for the metal - poor stars .",
    "the estimated @xmath36 depends on the assumed ages of the globular clusters used in this study .",
    "we have chosen 12",
    " 16  gyr as an acceptable age range of the galactic globular clusters m15 and m3 following chaboyer , demarque , & sarajedini ( 1996 ) .",
    "the line with asterisks in the top panels of figure 3 is the locus of the mass loss in the adopted age range , and this yields the estimated mass loss efficiency of @xmath52 0.2  0.5 , which is in good agreement with the estimates from the previous studies of metal - poor stars as introduced above .",
    "previous studies ( see above ) seem to suggest that estimated @xmath36 s for metal - poor stars are more consistent with one another than for metal - rich stars , in which @xmath36 varies from 0.25 to 2  3 . despite the large uncertainty",
    ", this seems to suggest a metallicity - dependence of @xmath36 in the sense of increasing @xmath36 with increasing metallicity if , as suggested by reimers ( 1975 ) , @xmath52 1 for @xmath16 = @xmath9 .",
    "figure 4 shows the mass loss estimates , @xmath53 , for metal - rich stars .",
    "there are two general trends to be noted in figures 3  4 .",
    "firstly , @xmath53generally increases as age increases mainly because @xmath54decreases with increasing age and the lifetime of a red giant ( @xmath55 ) becomes significantly longer as its mass ( @xmath54 ) decreases .",
    "secondly , @xmath53reaches a maximum when @xmath54becomes fairly low .",
    "this is because , below this mass , the stellar evolutionary pace is slower than the stellar core growing pace .",
    "the mass loss is a product of the two competing time scales , the evolutionary time scale on the rgb and the core growth time scale .",
    "figure 5 shows that @xmath53increases as @xmath54decreases until a certain mass ( @xmath54@xmath37 1  @xmath32 in case of @xmath16 = @xmath9 ) is reached because @xmath55 increases as @xmath54decreases and @xmath53obviously increases as @xmath55 increases .",
    "below this mass , however , the evolutionary pace is much slower than the core growing pace , so before the star reaches the tip of the rgb , its core becomes large enough to cause @xmath43@xmath56  @xmath32 .",
    "thus a further evolution on the rgb is halted and the post - rgb phase begins .",
    "the post - rgb stars with menv @xmath49 0.01  @xmath32are assumed not to become hb stars but to become wd stars following the @xmath57  @xmath32track of sweigart et al .",
    "( 1974 ) . as discussed above , it is possible that some red giant stars with total masses very nearly equal to the helium ignition core mass will start core helium burning while or after crossing from red to blue giant in the hr - diagram ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this crucial mass range ,",
    "the mass loss estimation is highly sensitive to how the mass loss takes place ( which is poorly known ) , and thus it has to be carried out with much caution .",
    "the same phenomenon exists even if the minimum @xmath43hypothesis is removed .",
    "one can avoid such complications by including mass loss in the stellar evolution calculations from the beginning , if the mass loss mechanism were better understood .",
    "however , the current standard models do not yet take into account mass loss simply because the understanding about mass loss is still primitive .",
    "reimers formula suggests most mass loss takes place near the end of the rgb where surface gravity becomes smallest .",
    "moreover , theoretical hydrodynamical models ( @xcite ; willson , bowen , & struck 1996 ) suggest that mass loss on the rgb is an even more abrupt phenomenon near the end of the rgb than predicted by reimers formula .",
    "willson ( 1996 , private communication ) even suggested that it would be closer to truth to remove a certain mass from the star at the tip of the rgb than to include reimers formula in the stellar evolutionary calculations .",
    "if this is true , whether a mass loss formula is included in the construction of the tracks or not causes little difference on the stellar evolution and on the estimated mass loss .",
    "it may even be prudent not to include an arbitrary mass loss formula in the evolutionary calculations untill a more reliable mass loss formula becomes available .",
    "the theoretical hydrodynamical models suggest that mass loss takes place when the star reaches a certain critical luminosity ( the `` cliff '' ) , which is a function of mass and metallicity . below the cliff",
    ", the mass loss rate is too low to be observable ; and above the cliff mass loss takes place so rapidly that the star is unlikely to be observed in this phase of evolution .",
    "it is significant that their models precisely reproduce reimers s formula with @xmath36 = 1 for @xmath16 = @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , they explain the positive metallicity - dependence of @xmath36 which observations may be indicating . while their models have not yet been parameterized for population synthesis , willson et al .",
    "( 1996 , private communication ) advise using reimers formula with variable @xmath36 in the sense that @xmath36 increases as metallicity increases .",
    "we call this _ the variable @xmath36 hypothesis_. table 6 shows the suggested @xmath36 for different metallicity .",
    "the population synthesis models in this study have all been constructed using values of @xmath36 = 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.7 , and 1.0 that roughly span the range of empirical and hydrodynamical estimates .",
    "this will allow us to investigate the effects of mass loss efficiency on the model cmds and seds .",
    "the impact of the variable @xmath36 hypothesis , which has been investigated earlier ( @xcite ) for single abundance models , will be revisited for the composite galaxy models in our next paper ( yi , demarque , & oemler 1997 ) .",
    "we adopt the evolutionary tracks of core helium - burning phase mainly from ydk .",
    "since ydk do not provide post - agb ( pagb ) tracks , the pagb tracks of kiel group ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have been adopted .",
    "the ydk hb tracks in this study are the short version ( plus symbols in figures 1  2 of ydk ) of the full tracks ( as solid lines in their figures 1  2 ) .",
    "the time step on each hb track is 5 myr and the mass step is approximately 0.04  @xmath32 , with smaller steps near the blue end of the hb as listed in table 1 of ydk .",
    "the masses of the pagb stars and wd s and the process that determines them are yet to be understood",
    ". meanwhile , kiel group s models of @xmath58 , 0.565 , and 0.598  @xmath32have been used in the actual population synthesis .",
    "one of these three models was chosen as the progeny of an hb star ( almost arbitrarily ) depending on the mass of the hb star ; that is , 0.546 , 0.565 , and 0.598  @xmath32models were chosen for the hb stars with @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "however , the choice of the model does not affect the resulting model integrated spectrum much because pagb stars are not likely to be the major uv sources when a galaxy shows a strong uv upturn , as will be shown in section 4.1 .",
    "ydk ( figures 1  2 of ydk ) show that late stellar evolution in the core helium - burning phase , especially in metal - rich galaxies , is very complicated . and ,",
    "such evolved , metal - rich core helium - burning stars are potentially significant uv sources .",
    "therefore , in order to fully incorporate the complete evolution of core helium - burning stars in the population synthesis code , a physically plausible treatment of the phase is crucial .",
    "the modified gaussian mass distribution ( @xcite ) , first invented by rood ( 1973 ) and later modified and elaborated on by lee et al . , has been assumed in this study for the core helium - burning phase as follows : @xmath62\\ , ( m_{rg}\\,-\\,m ) \\,\\ , exp\\,[\\,-\\,\\frac{({\\overline{m_{hb}}\\,}\\,-\\,m)^{2}}{\\sigma^{2}}]\\ ] ] where @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) is a mass dispersion factor , @xmath65 is a normalization factor , and @xmath66(@xmath67 @xmath54@xmath13 @xmath53 ) is the mean mass of hb stars .",
    "three values of @xmath63 ( 0.01 , 0.06 , and 0.99 in  @xmath32 ) have been chosen to represent distributions similar to a delta - function , a globular - cluster - function ( @xcite ) , and a near - constant - function , respectively . while the true value of @xmath63 is still quite uncertain ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , we have chosen @xmath63 = 0.06  @xmath32as the `` standard '' value in this study following empirical ( but , with no physical basis ) choices of rood ( 1973 ) and lee et al .",
    "the shape of the functions are shown in figure 6 . in actual calculations , we first estimate the mass loss as a function of age and metallicity , then , apply the gaussian distribution on the mass lossrgensen & thejll ( 1993a ) and dcruz et al .",

    "j@xmath68rgensen & thejll ( 1993a ) noted that `` star - to - star variations of @xmath36 , between @xmath36 = 0.0 and @xmath36 = 0.7 can explain the hb morphology in typical globular clusters '' .",
    "it would be very interesting to investigate the effect of such hb treatments to the uv population synthesis . ] .",
    "assumption of a ( modified ) gaussian function for the hb mass distribution has been questioned ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the single - gaussian distribution has been very successful in reproducing the observed hb morphology in galactic globular clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the total number of core helium - burning stars , @xmath69 , is as follows : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the lifetime of the core helium - burning star of @xmath72 = @xmath66 , and @xmath73 is the rate at which stars leave the rgb for the core helium - burning stage .",
    "so , at a fixed time , there will be @xmath69 core helium - burning stars on all post - rgb phases .",
    "the rate , @xmath73 in number of stars per unit time interval @xmath74 is defined to be @xmath75    the calculated probability , @xmath76 , is applied to each evolutionary track according to its mass @xmath23 . there is a different list of stars for different chemical compositions , and each track has a number of evolutionary points with evolutionary time scale information .",
    "thus , the number of stars at the @xmath77th evolutionary point on the @xmath25th track will be @xmath78 and @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the probability of the star of @xmath81 to be present , @xmath82 is the time spent by the @xmath25th star in the table near the @xmath77th position in the cmd and @xmath83 is the lifetime of the @xmath25th star in the post - rgb phase .",
    "the sum of the probability @xmath80 should be unity : @xmath84    then the total flux from the core helium - burning stars , @xmath20 , is @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the flux from the @xmath25th star in the list of post - rgb stars near the @xmath77th evolutionary point .",
    "spectral evolution of galaxies in the uv is much more uncertain than that in the optical band because it is more sensitive to the evolution of post - rgb stars which are less well understood than the ms  rgb stars that dominate the optical flux .",
    "it is important to understand first the effects of input parameters on the resulting cmd and uv sed in order to answer the questions related to the spectral evolution of the galaxy , including the uv upturn phenomenon .",
    "primary parameters affecting the uv flux are age and metallicity .",
    "these are the most fundamental quantities in describing stellar populations , because they predominantly determine the @xmath5 s of post - rgb stars .",
    "we would like to investigate whether metal - rich old stellar systems , such as giant elliptical galaxies , are capable of exhibiting a pronounced uv flux .",
    "secondary parameters include mass loss efficiency , galactic helium enrichment parameter , form of the dispersion in mass loss , and the slope of imf , while these parameters are not necessarily less important in producing uv flux than the primary parameters .",
    "we assume in this study that all stars in a model stellar system form in an instantaneous starburst .",
    "the effects of age and metallicity in old stellar systems have recently been widely recognized through studies of greggio & renzini ( 1990 ) , bressan et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , and of dorman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . in this section",
    ", we would like to provide a simple explanation of the basic conclusions of such previous studies by means of stellar evolution theory .",
    "we also illustrate that core helium - burning stars are a more likely major uv source in old stellar systems than pagb stars .",
    "both a higher age and a higher metallicity cause a galaxy to look redder in the optical band mainly because ms and rgb stars become cooler as they age and as metallicity increases , as is clearly shown in figures 7  12 .",
    "the effects of age and metallicity on the uv flux are more complicated , particularly because the major uv sources vary with time . before we discuss the details , it is important to remember that we are investigating the effects of age and metallicity while other parameters , such as @xmath36 , are kept constant .",
    "if other parameters are age - dependent and/or metallicity - dependent the true effects of age and metallicity become much more complicated .",
    "the major uv sources vary with time .",
    "as seen in figures 7  12 , pagb stars are the only far - uv sources in the early ( @xmath48 5  10  gyr , depending on the metallicity ) history of galaxy evolution , when the majority of core helium - burning stars are still too cool to produce any uv light .",
    "however , once the galaxy is old enough to develop a substantial number of hot core helium - burning stars , those stars dominate the uv spectrum .    in order to investigate the light contribution from various sources",
    ", we first arbitrarily divide the core helium - burning stage into two : central helium - burning stage and shell helium - burning stage .",
    "the central helium - burning stage is defined as the stage where most of the helium - burning takes place near the center of the star .",
    "this stage lasts from the zero age hb ( zahb ) to the point where the central helium is almost exhausted ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "similarly , the shell helium - burning stage is defined as the stage that stretches from this point until the star reaches either the tip of the agb or the beginning of the wd phase , whichever comes first . so the central helium - burning stage is generally referred to as the hb , and the shell helium - burning stage as the post - hb phase including the evolved hb , the agb and the slow blue phase ( sbp ) .",
    "these two stages are denoted as crosses and squares in figure 13 .",
    "assuming that all the stars in elliptical galaxies have formed in an instantaneous burst , figure 14 shows that central and shell helium - burning stars are far more efficient uv sources than pagb stars in old galaxies .",
    "the upper and lower panels of figure 14 show the light contribution from various evolutionary stages in young and old @xmath88-@xmath89 model galaxies .",
    "it shows that ms and rgb stars are the dominant sources in the visible range at all times .",
    "the far - uv spectrum is , however , mainly dominated by highly evolved stars . at small ages , pagb and ms turn - off stars are the dominant far - uv and near - uv sources ( the upper panel ) , respectively .",
    "however , such galaxies do not exhibit any significant amount of uv flux , as shown in the 5  gyr old models in figures 10  12 . the critical moment which divides the periods",
    "in which pagb stars or core helium - burning stars dominate the far - uv flux is a sensitive function of chemical composition and other parameters ( such as @xmath36 ) . in the case of the extreme - uv ( @xmath90 )",
    ", pagb stars always dominate because of their high @xmath5 s .",
    "however , once galaxies become old enough to contain hot hb stars , shell helium - burning stars dominate the flux in the far - uv ( @xmath91 300  1,500  ) , while both central and shell helium - burning stars are equally important in the near - uv ( @xmath91 1,500  3,000  ) .",
    "the effect of age on the uv flux is relatively simple .",
    "figures 15  16 show the uv - to-@xmath0 colors as a function of age and metallicity .",
    "the model magnitudes are defined as @xmath92  @xmath93  @xmath94  log  @xmath95 where @xmath95 is the mean flux in the bandpass .",
    "the @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 are defined by averaging the flux within the ranges 1250  1850  , 2200  2800  ( @xcite ) , and 5055  5945 (@xcite ) , respectively .",
    "the observational data are from table 1  2 of dorman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . from their table",
    ", we selected the clusters for which both m(1500)-@xmath0 and m(2500)-@xmath0 are available .",
    "they are mostly @xmath99 or @xmath100 - 2 data .",
    "the uit data of ngc1904 ( m79 ) and ngc5139 ( @xmath101cen ) have also been adapted . as a result , three clusters ( ngc1904 , ngc5139 , and ngc5272 ) have two data points in our adapted cluster sample .",
    "we excluded the iue data because the iue aperture is so small that iue data do not represent the integrated light properly ( @xcite ) . in case of metal - poor systems ( figure 15 ) , uv - to-@xmath0 colors become redder with age for a while as the ms turn - off stars , the major uv sources in young metal - poor systems , become redder with time , and then they turn around to become bluer as hb stars get hotter .",
    "most metal - poor globular clusters are reasonably matched by the models with @xmath102 but metal - rich globular clusters like ngc6388 and 47 tuc are not matched by the same models of 47 tuc obtained by @xmath100 - 2 is likely to be the lower ( bluest ) limit because there is one bright pagb star in @xmath100 - 2 s large aperture ( @xcite ) .",
    "this issue of @xmath36 will be discussed in the next section .",
    "similarly , metal - rich elliptical galaxies are reasonably reproduced by the models with @xmath103 in figure 16 .      the contribution from each evolutionary stage to",
    "the uv flux also varies with metallicity because the post - hb evolutionary pattern differs according to metallicity , as shown in figures 1  2 of ydk .",
    "since the uv - bright sbp phenomenon becomes far more prominent in more metal - rich stars , the contribution from the shell helium - burning stars in the far - uv is more conspicuous in metal - rich models ( figure 17 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the light contribution from evolved core helium - burning stars to the total @xmath104 band flux ( @xmath91 3,000 - 4,000  ) is not negligible .",
    "the lower panels of figures 14 and 17 suggest that substantial amount of the total light comes from such evolved stars .",
    "however , note that the precise quantity highly depends on the adopted input parameters .",
    "earlier population synthesis studies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) noticed that population synthesis models , that did not include such evolved stars in an adequate way , were predicting much redder @xmath105 colors than observed .",
    "they suggested that this mismatch could originate from the presence of young stars in giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "however , gunn , stryker , & tinsley ( 1981 ) recognized the lack of empirical support for the young star interpretation , and suggested blue stragglers and what we now call pagb stars as possible candidates for the observed uv flux .",
    "we understand now , as clearly shown in figures 14 and 17 , that a proper treatment of evolved stars , especially with a realistic mass dispersion on the hb , enhances the uv ",
    "@xmath104 band flux significantly , as pointed out by burstein et al .",
    "( 1988 ) earlier .",
    "this short wavelength region is extremely sensitive not only to age and metallicity of the galaxy but also to various input parameters , including mass loss efficiency and the hb mass distribution , as will be shown in the following sections .",
    "the overall effect of metallicity is more complicated than that of age because it is a product of several competing effects .",
    "even when we consider only the period in which the core helium - burning stars are the main uv sources , it is better to see the metallicity effect in two different metallicity domains , ( 1 ) @xmath106 @xmath9and ( 2 ) @xmath107 @xmath9 ,    when @xmath106 @xmath9 , uv - to-@xmath0 flux ratios decrease with increasing metallicity .",
    "this is a result of the following competing effects .",
    "( 1 ) the temperature of the hb stars decreases dramatically as metallicity increases , ( 2 ) more metal - rich stars stay on the ms  rgb longer ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , but ( 3 ) a larger mass loss of more metal - rich stars for a fixed @xmath36 ( figures 3  4 ) compensates for these two effects ( @xcite ) . the phenomenon ( 2 )",
    "is mainly caused by the delay of the evolution due to the opacity effect .",
    "consequently , the phenomenon ( 2 ) makes a more metal - rich cluster have more massive red giants at a fixed age , but ( 3 ) compensates for this effect and makes the @xmath66of more metal - rich clusters smaller than that of metal - poor clsuters in this metallicity domain .",
    "however , the phenomenon in ( 1 ) again negates the result of the competition between that of ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "the net effect of all these competitions is a decrease in the uv - to-@xmath0 flux ratios with increasing metallicity which is consistent with observations , as illustrated in figure 15 . in figure 15 , three metal - poor models covering 1  25  gyr of age are compared with globular cluster data .",
    "it is clear that both observations and models indicate that more metal - rich systems in this metal - poor regime are redder in these uv - to-@xmath0 colors .",
    "it should be noted that this trend ( the correlation between the uv - to-@xmath0 ratios and metallicity ) is based on the assumption that other parameters are identical . in the case of galactic globular clusters",
    ", it has been suggested that there is a substantial spread in age among them which influences the hb morphology and thus the flux ratios .",
    "a large scatter in the flux ratios in figure 16 may have been caused by such differences in cluster parameters .",
    "in the metal - rich regime @xmath107 @xmath9 , the evolutionary phenomena are quite different .",
    "firstly , the higher the metallicity , the faster the ms  rgb evolution , because the luminosity from the hydrogen burning is significantly sensitive to the mean molecular weight that is determined by the chemical composition .",
    "this has been noticed previously by a number of workers ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . under the assumption of a positive @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4(@xmath37 2  3 in this study ) , a higher metallicity means a higher helium abundance .",
    "a higher helium abundance causes a higher mean molecular weight that results in a faster stellar evolution ( see ydk ) .",
    "this causes the @xmath54of more metal - rich stars at a fixed age to be smaller .",
    "secondly , the increase in mass loss as a function of metallicity ( figures 3  4 ) makes @xmath66of more metal - rich hb stars much smaller at a fixed age .",
    "in addition to this , even many of the metal - rich hb stars that are born as extremely cool stars quickly evolve to become uv - bright stars ( namely , sbp stars in figures 1  2 of ydk ) . as a result ,",
    "more metal - rich galaxies are expected to contain more uv - bright stars at a given age in this metal - rich regime , given other parameters fixed .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 16 : the more metal - rich , the bluer .",
    "figure 16 seems to suggest that the galaxy data are better fitted by the @xmath108 model than more metal - rich models .",
    "we believe that this is an artifact that is produced by the comparison between the galaxy data and single - abundance models . obviously , galaxies are not composed of stars of a single abundance only . the effect of the composite population treatment will be discussed in detail in our next paper .",
    "the data and models in figure 18 show that metal - poor globular clusters in general exhibit bluer m(1500)-@xmath0 and m(2500)-@xmath0 colors than elliptical galaxies ( bottom panel of figure 18 ) .",
    "this is mainly because of the opacity effect on the hb stars ( in the case of m(1500)-@xmath0 ) and on the ms stars ( in the case of m(2500)-@xmath0 ) . for a given age ,",
    "the opacity effect on the stellar evolution causes metal - poor blue hb stars to have higher @xmath5 s than metal - rich counterparts , even though the mean mass of metal - rich hb stars , @xmath66 , are likely to be smaller ( note that , given the other parameters fixed , a lower - mass hb star is hotter ) according to reimers formula ( see figures 3  4 and table 1 4 ) .",
    "moreover , even if their @xmath5 s are identical , the opacity effect ( via the line - blanketing effect in the spectral synthesis ) causes more metal - rich hb stars to look much redder than metal - poor hb stars . for the same reason ,",
    "metal - poor systems show bluer m(2500)-@xmath0 colors , but this time because of the opacity effect on @xmath109 @xmath110 ( @xcite ) . as a result ,",
    "metal - poor populations exhibit stronger uv - to-@xmath0 flux ratios than metal - rich populations . however",
    ", metal - poor populations with such blue uv - to-@xmath0 colors do not exhibit a `` uv upturn '' ( the continuously increasing flux with decreasing wavelength below 2,500  ) . instead , their uv spectra , even for the uv - strong globular clusters , are rather flat below 2,500  . consequently , globular clusters have redder m(1500)-m(2500 ) colors than elliptical galaxies , as shown in the top panel of figure 18 .",
    "so , it should be said that only elliptical galaxies exhibit a `` uv upturn '' in a strict sense , as models predict in figure 18 .",
    "this result disagrees with park & lee ( 1997 ) s recent suggestion .",
    "details will be discussed in our next paper .",
    "figures 19  20 show that the magnitude of the uv flux is sensitive to the mass loss efficiency @xmath36 in reimers formula . a larger @xmath36 results in lower - mass , hotter hb stars .",
    "therefore , a value for mass loss efficiency should be adopted carefully and with sufficient justification .",
    "the probable range of @xmath36 seems to be 0.3  1.0 ( or even 2 ) with a possible positive metallicity - dependence supported both by observations and hydrodynamical models , as discussed in section 3.2 .",
    "such sensitivity of the uv flux to the mass loss efficiency has significant implications .",
    "if reimers formula is an adequate approximation of reality , @xmath36 of stars of @xmath107 @xmath9should be near or larger than 0.7 ( this value depends on the assumed metallicity of giant elliptical galaxies ) in order for a metal - rich elliptical galaxy to exhibit a uv upturn within a hubble time .",
    "old , metal - rich galaxies should have an appreciable number of uv - bright stars and a noticeable uv upturn as long as @xmath111 for metal - rich ( @xmath107 @xmath9 ) stars . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath112 for metal - poor stars , as both observations and theory suggest , metal - poor stars @xmath113 be major uv sources in elliptical galaxies because they do not produce sufficient far - uv flux ( e.g. m(1500)-m(2500 ) color ) within a hubble time , as figure 20 shows .",
    "this problem becomes worse when even shorter wavelength regions ( @xmath48 1,500  ) are compared , because the uv spectral energy distributions of giant elliptical galaxies have much higher far - uv flux than near - uv flux , and this can not be produced by metal - poor models unless @xmath36 is unrealistically high .",
    "even if larger @xmath36-models ( e.g. 1.0 ) may reproduce such high far - uv flux ( bottom panel in figure 20 ) , the predicted overal spectral shape in the uv does not look similar to what is observed .",
    "detailed quantitative study will be shortly presented by yi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "conversely , the magnitude of the uv upturn can be used to set a constraint on the mass loss efficiency of galactic globular clusters whose age and metallicity are independently estimated 1,500  ) spectra should be available . ] . for instance",
    ", if we compare the far - uv spectrum of m79 ( figure 5 in @xcite ) with figure 20 , the model with @xmath52 0.5 reproduces the empirical spectrum best , assuming 15  gyr for its age and `` standard '' values of model parameters ( @xmath27 = 1.35 , @xmath63 = 0.06 ) .",
    "figure 21 illustrates the @xmath36-dependence of metal - poor models . as discussed earlier in section 3.2 , low-@xmath36 models ( @xmath36 = 0.3  0.5 ) reasonably match the observations at an age of @xmath37 15  gyrs .",
    "however , the metal - rich clusters ( filled squares , e.g. ngc6388 ) can not be matched by the models with consistent ages .",
    "for example , if @xmath39 even for such metal - rich globular clusters , uv color fitting would suggest ngc6388 is almost 25  gyrs old , which is much higher than the average isochrone - age of globular clusters ( @xmath37 15  gyr , @xcite ) . if a larger @xmath36 is adopted for such metal - rich globular clusters instead , their colors can be reproduced successfully at a reasonable age .",
    "for instance , the age estimate for ngc6388 would be @xmath37 19 gyr and 15  gyr if @xmath102 and 0.7 , respectively .",
    "if other complexities are ignored at the moment , this suggests @xmath52 0.7 for @xmath114 0.006 ( the metallicity of ngc6388 ) , which is higher than the best fitting @xmath36 for metal - poor clusters .",
    "this metallicity - dependence of @xmath36 is consistent with the variable-@xmath36 hypothesis discussed in section 3.2 .",
    "elliptical galaxies are also better matched by high-@xmath36 models ( @xmath115 0.7 ) , as shown in figure 22 , which is again consistent with the variable-@xmath36 hypothesis .",
    "note that in this diagram we use m(1500)-m(2500 ) as the y - axis because m(1500)-m(2500 ) describes the uv upturn strength of galaxies better .",
    "regardless of metallicity , @xmath36 certainly plays a very important role in model uv flux in the sense that a higher-@xmath36 , at least in the rage @xmath36 = 0.3  1.0 , leads to a higher uv flux .",
    "the galactic helium enrichment parameter , @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4 , is another important determinant of the uv flux , not only because it affects the pace of evolution of ms and rgb stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , but also because metal - rich stars with a higher @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4become uv - bright more readily ( @xcite ; @xcite ; ydk ) .",
    "this phenomenon is more significant when @xmath107 @xmath9 , with an implicit assumption of a positive @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4 .",
    "therefore , a metal - rich galaxy with a higher value of @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4produces a higher uv flux , as shown in figures 23  24 .",
    "qualitatively , models with @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4= 2 develop a similar magnitude of uv flux to that of @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4= 3 at approximately 10  20 % greater ages .",
    "despite such a difference , it is difficult to estimate the true @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4from uv magnitudes only because the evolutionary paths for different @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4are very similar as shown in figure 24 , unless their ages are already known .",
    "if @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4is not positive ( a very unrealistic assumption in the light of what is known about nucleosynthesis in massive stars , see e.g. @xcite ) , in other words , if helium does not increase with increasing metallicity , several complicated effects will compete with one another : ( 1 ) the sbp ( slow blue phase ) phenomenon will not be significant even in metal - rich ( but , not unrealistically metal - rich ) populations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this reduces the uv flux from such hot sbp stars .",
    "( 2 ) the evolutionary pace of the more metal - rich stars will perhaps become slower because the opacity effect will overwhelm the hydrogen luminosity - mean molecular weight effect ( see eqn . 3 in ydk ) .",
    "this is similar to the metallicity effect on the evolutionary pace of subsolar - abundance stars ; namely , the more metal - rich , the slower the evolutionary pace on the ms and rgb if @xmath116 @xmath9 .",
    "this causes a cooler hb . ( 3 ) but , the mass loss will still increase with metallicity regardless of helium abundance .",
    "this will cause hb stars to become hotter .",
    "the final result of this competition is not trivial to guess .",
    "unfortunately , the stellar models of @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4= 0 are not yet available for numerical experiments .      the slope of imf , @xmath27 , as defined in eqn .",
    "3 , has a very small effect on the resulting uv flux as shown in figures 25  27 , even if @xmath27 differs from one galaxy to another significantly .",
    "a model with a smaller @xmath27 sends more stars from the ms both to the rgb and to the hb and results in an increase in flux in all wavelength regions . so",
    "the relative flux is not much affected .",
    "many observations have supported @xmath117 1.35 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and thus we have little justification for adopting a significantly different value .",
    "the effect of the difference in various forms of imf for the very low - mass stars on the resulting seds is negligible because they contribute little to the total light of the host galaxy although they could affect the calculated mass - to - luminosity ratio significantly .",
    "a smooth mass dispersion on the hb has not been seriously taken into account as an input parameter in earlier population synthesis studies - function or by constant - function within a certain mass range , both of which are arbitrary .",
    "although this is a much improved effort compared to previous works in terms of the hb treatment , it is still ad hoc because such bimodality is supported ( at least so far ) only by a few globular clusters , e.g. ngc2808 ( crocker , rood , & oconnell 1988 ) .",
    "a single - gaussian mass distribution reproduces the hb distribution adequately ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , as discussed in section 3.2 . ] , although it is very important to the resulting sed in the uv .",
    "its effect is not monotonic . when a galaxy is young , and has mostly red hb stars , allowing a larger dispersion in mass leads to a larger number of hot hb stars , which results in a stronger uv flux ( figure 27 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "when a galaxy is already old enough to have most of its hb stars on the hot side , a larger mass dispersion causes a weaker uv flux ( figure 28 ) .",
    "these effects on the colors are illustrated in figure 29 .",
    "as is the case of @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4 , it is difficult to choose an optimal @xmath63 from the uv colors because models with even very different values of @xmath63 follow very similar evolutionary paths ( figure 29 ) unless the age of the galaxies is known a priori .    because of this complex sensitivity of the uv flux to the assumed hb mass distribution , a realistic hb treatment is essential to the uv population synthesis",
    ". oversimplified hb treatments , such as a clump star assumption , a single - mass assumption and a flat distribution , are inadequate for uv studies unless there is a sufficient justification .",
    "recently , several groups have been using the evolutionary population synthesis ( eps ) technique in the hope of understanding the stellar content and the evolution of giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "most of these studies are aimed at solving the so - called uv upturn mystery .",
    "although eps in the uv is a powerful technique for these purposes , its dependence on various input parameters has not been widely known .",
    "therefore , both modelers and model users are vulnerable to misinterpretations of the results from their population synthesis studies .",
    "the eps technique has been described in this study in detail .",
    "we show that the model uv flux is very sensitive to several input parameters as various earlier studies pointed out .",
    "these input parameters include not only age and metallicity , but also mass loss efficiency @xmath36 , galactic helium enrichment parameter @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4 , and mass distribution on the hb .",
    "the effects of these parameters are as follows .",
    "once ms turn - off stars become too cool to dominate the near - uv integrated flux , the relative strength of uv flux to visible flux always increases with age because a larger number of hotter core helium - burning stars develop as a galaxy ages . before this point , uv - to-@xmath0 colors become redder with increasing age as ms stars , the major near - uv sources at low ages , become cooler .",
    "this turning point is sensitive to metallicity and other parameters .",
    "it could be approximately 1  gyr or even smaller if @xmath107 0.06 but could be as large as 10  gyrs if @xmath16 = 0.0004 .",
    "a possibility that giant elliptical galaxies have a substantial fraction of very young ( @xmath49 1  gyr ) stars is ignored in this study because of lack of empirical support ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "\\2 . in the metal - rich regime ( @xmath107 @xmath9 )",
    ", metallicity has a positive impact on the uv flux once a model galaxy is old enough to have a substantial number of hot core helium - burning stars .",
    "this is caused mainly by the following phenomena in stellar evolution : under the assumption of a moderate @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4(@xmath37 2  3 ) , ( 1 ) more metal - rich stars evolve faster when @xmath107 @xmath9 , which results in a quicker hot hb development , ( 2 ) more metal - rich red giants experience a larger mass loss , and ( 3 ) more metal - rich core helium - burning stars become uv - bright stars in the slow blue phase ( sbp ) more easily .",
    "this result is in agreement with brown et al .",
    "( 1997 ) s recent spectral analysis which suggests that `` models with supersolar metal abundance and helium best reproduce the flux across the entire hut wavelength range ... '' .",
    "optical spectra of giant elliptical galaxies suggest @xmath107 @xmath9 . in the metal - poor regime ,",
    "the metallicity effect is reversed , however .",
    "this is mainly because the opacity effect overwhelms the metallicity - mass loss relation .",
    "in addition , in this metal - poor regime , an increase in metallicity causes stars on the ms  rgb to evolve more slowly and causes the hb to look redder .    \\3 . because the uv - bright phase ( the sbp ) of core helium - burning stars is positively correlated with helium abundance , a model galaxy with a higher @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4exhibits a stronger uv upturn .",
    "this agrees with the result of greggio & renzini ( 1990 ) .",
    "if , as we expect , the true @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4is within the range 2  3 , then the degree of the sensitivity seems moderate .",
    "the effect of @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4and the cause of the effect are similar to those of metallicity described above .",
    "a model with @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4= 2 would develop a uv flux with a similar magnitude to that of a model with @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4= 3 at slightly later time ( approximately 10  20 % of their ages ) .",
    "\\4 . a larger mass loss efficiency , @xmath36 , causes a stronger uv upturn because it causes a hotter hb .",
    "the probable range of @xmath36 is 0.3  1 ( or higher ) with a large uncertainty and probably with a positive metallicity - dependence suggested by hydrodynamic models . if we admit that the other parameters in this study are relatively better known than @xmath36 , fixing the other parameters allows us to constrain the true value of @xmath36 . in the metal - poor regime ( @xmath118 ) , if we assume that galactic globular clusters are about 15 billion years old , the imf slope @xmath119 , and @xmath120  @xmath32 , the models with @xmath121  0.5 fit metal - poor cluster data better .",
    "however , a larger value - models ( e.g. @xmath122  0.7 ) fit relatively metal - rich globular cluster data ( such as ngc6388 ) substantially better . similarly , under the same assumptions as the metal - poor case , only high-@xmath36 ( 0.7  1.0 ) models fit the elliptical galaxy data .",
    "mass dispersion on the hb is crucial to the uv flux .",
    "a larger dispersion causes a stronger ( weaker ) uv flux when the hb stars with the average mass are red ( blue ) . because the effect of @xmath63 is large , a population synthesis based on a non - realistic synthetic hb is likely to lead us to erroneous conclusions",
    ". we chose @xmath123",
    "@xmath32from globular cluster studies as our `` standard '' dispersion",
    ". however , this value does not have a physical basis and is poorly known for metal - rich systems .    \\6 .",
    "even a significant change in the imf slope , @xmath27 , results in only a slight change in the resulting uv flux in comparison to optical flux . a smaller value of @xmath27 causes a slightly stronger uv flux , because a model galaxy with a smaller @xmath27 sends more stars from the rgb to the hb at a fixed time .",
    "however , there is little justification for an adoption of a much different imf slope from the standard one , i.e. @xmath27 = 1.35 .",
    "based on this sensitivity study , we conclude as follows . both the positive correlation between metallicity and uv - to-@xmath0 colors among elliptical galaxies ( @xcite ) and the negative correlation between metallicity and uv - to-@xmath0 colors among globular clusters have been explained .",
    "old , metal - rich populations , such as giant elliptical galaxies , naturally develop a uv upturn within a reasonable time scale ( @xmath48 hubble time ) without the necessity of the presence of young stars .",
    "low - mass , core helium - burning ( hb and evolved hb ) stars are more likely to be the main uv sources in the old stellar systems than any other types of stars , as suggested before ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason , both metal - poor and metal - rich populations can develop a uv upturn if an arbitrarily large age may be assumed .",
    "metal - poor models , such as globular clusters , are bluer in m(1500)-@xmath0 and m(2500)-@xmath0 than metal - rich models like elliptical galaxies as observations suggest , mainly because of the opacity effect .",
    "but , their uv spectra are flat and fail to exhibit a strong uv upturn because they lack very hot hb and post - hb stars .",
    "it takes too long ( @xmath10 hubble time ) for a metal - poor population to develop a uv upturn of the observed strength if @xmath124 0.7 for metal - poor stars as both observations and hydrodynamical models suggest . for this reason ,",
    "no metal - poor stellar system has been observed to show a strong uv upturn ( i.e. the continuous increase in the uv flux with decreasing wavelength below 2,500  ) no matter how old it is .",
    "even if metal - poor models with a larger @xmath36 ( @xmath115 1.0 , an unrealistic assumption ) may reproduce the observed uv - to-@xmath0 colors of giant elliptical galaxies , the overall spectral shape in the uv would not match the observations very well , as will be quantitatively shown in our next paper ( @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "metal - rich model populations contain a sufficiently large number of uv - bright sbp stars , in addition to hot hb stars , to exhibit a uv upturn of the observed magnitude unless the input parameters assumed in this study are significantly wrong .",
    "based on this argument , metal - poor stars can not be the main cause of the uv upturn in giant elliptical galaxies that are obviously composite populations , as long as the majority of stars in giant elliptical galaxies are metal - rich .",
    "two main effects drive a metal - rich population to develop a uv upturn of the observed magnitude earlier than a metal - poor population .",
    "firstly , metal - rich stars experience a larger amount of mass loss on the rgb when reimers formula and a fixed @xmath36 are used .",
    "this generates lower - mass hb stars at a fixed time .",
    "this is mainly because a higher opacity causes a larger stellar radius .",
    "reimers mass loss formula ( and our intuition as well ) suggests that a smaller surface gravity caused by the larger radius results in a larger mass loss .",
    "secondly , even if some hb stars are not hot on the zahb , more metal - rich stars evolve to uv - bright stars more easily .    in conclusion",
    ", it is important to realize that the presence of the uv upturn in the spectrum of giant elliptical galaxies becomes neither extraordinary nor unexpected when proper treatments of various evolutionary stages are taken into account .",
    "it is a very natural consequence of advanced stellar evolution that has not been known in detail until recently .",
    "while the presence of the uv upturn has been qualitatively understood , the detailed characteristics of the observed uv upturn also have to be reproduced in order to confirm the theoretical explanations .",
    "all these aspects will be investigated quantitatively in the following paper ( @xcite ) .",

    "<S> we present models of the late stages of stellar evolution intended to explain the `` uv upturn '' phenomenon in elliptical galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> such models are sensitive to values of a number of poorly - constrained physical parameters , including metallicity , age , stellar mass loss , helium enrichment , and the distribution of stars on the zero age horizontal branch ( hb ) . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the sensitivity of the results to values of these parameters , and reach the following conclusions .    </S>",
    "<S> old , metal rich galaxies , such as giant ellipticals , naturally develop a uv upturn within a reasonable time scale - less than a hubble time - without the presence of young stars . </S>",
    "<S> the most likely stars to dominate the uv flux of such populations are low mass , core helium burning ( hb and evolved hb ) stars . </S>",
    "<S> metal - poor populations produce a higher ratio of uv - to-@xmath0 flux , due to opacity effects , but only metal - rich stars develop a uv upturn , in which the flux increases towards shorter uv wavelengths .    </S>",
    "<S> model color - magnitude diagrams and corresponding integrated spectra ( for various values of age , metallicity , helium enrichment , mass loss efficiency , initial mass function , and the hb mass dispersion factor ) are available on s.y.s world wide web site http://shemesh.gsfc.nasa.gov/model.html . </S>"
