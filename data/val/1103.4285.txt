    "the structural evolution as a function of the number of nucleons is a subject of increasing interest in nuclear structure , which is supported by a very intense activity on both theoretical and experimental sides @xcite . in particular ,",

    "experimentally , the efforts are focused on different and complementary directions .",
    "the most relevant for the purpose of this work are related , on the one hand , to the mass determination @xcite in the case of exotic neutron - rich nuclei with the accuracy required for the modeling of astrophysical events @xcite . in particular , the mass region of our concern here is highly significant to understand the nucleosynthesis path and the isotopic abundances generated by the astrophysical r process @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the focus is on laser - spectroscopy experiments aimed to measure nuclear spins , magnetic dipole moments , spectroscopic quadrupole moments and mean - square charge radii from isotopic shifts .",
    "considerable progress has been achieved in the last years ( for a recent review , see @xcite and references therein ) , and special attention has received the mass region studied in this work @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the region has been studied using phenomenological models @xcite and microscopic approaches , based on the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) @xcite , as well as nonrelativistic skyrme @xcite and gogny @xcite energy density functionals ( edf ) .",
    "all in all , the accumulated information on this mass region has allowed to establish some characteristic features , which can be associated to signatures of a shape transition at @xmath1 .",
    "different nuclear properties sensitive to these structural changes have been recently investigated @xcite in several isotopic chains in this mass region .",
    "we used a selfconsistent hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) approximation based on the finite range and density dependent gogny - edf @xcite and the equal filling approximation ( efa ) to deal with the odd nucleon .",
    "we analyzed bulk and spectroscopic properties of neutron - rich isotopes with both even @xmath3 ( sr , zr , and mo isotopes ) and odd @xmath3 ( rb isotopes ) .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to complete the systematic study of the bulk and spectroscopic properties in two chains of odd-@xmath3 isotopes , yttrium ( @xmath4 ) and niobium ( @xmath5 ) , as well as in the chain of krypton isotopes ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the description of odd-@xmath0 nuclei involves additional difficulties because the exact blocking procedure requires the breaking of time - reversal invariance , making the calculations more involved @xcite . in the present study we use the efa , a prescription widely used in mean - field calculations to preserve the advantages of time - reversal invariance .",
    "the predictions arising from various treatments of the blocking have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , concluding that the efa is sufficiently precise for most practical applications .",
    "more details of our procedure can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work we consider two parametrizations of the gogny - edf , namely d1s @xcite as the standard and",
    "most studied parameter set @xcite and d1 m @xcite as the most recent effort to find a new parametrization that improves the predictions for masses maintaining the excellent performance and predictive power of the former d1s .",
    "our aim is first to verify the robustness of our predictions with respect to the particular version of the edf employed and second , to test the performance of d1 m in the present context of the spectroscopy of odd-@xmath0 nuclei .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ theory ] , we present a brief description of the theoretical formalism used in the present work , i.e. , the hfb - efa framework .",
    "the results of our calculations for the considered nuclei are discussed in sec .",
    "[ results ] , where we pay attention to the one - quasiparticle states and their spectroscopic evolution along the y and nb isotopic chains .",
    "we also compare our results with the available experimental data for charge radii and two - neutron separation energies . in sec .",
    "[ sec_kr ] we show the results for krypton isotopes , as well as the systematics of the charge radii in the whole region from krypton ( @xmath6 ) up to molybdenum ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ conclu ] is devoted to the concluding remarks and work perspectives .",
    "our theoretical framework to deal with odd-@xmath0 nuclei is based on the gogny - hfb - efa formalism . in previous studies of even - even nuclei @xcite",
    "we have found advantageous to use the so called gradient method @xcite to obtain the solution of the hfb equations , leading to the ( even number parity ) vacuum @xmath8 . within this method , the hfb equation is recast in terms of a minimization ( variational ) process of the mean field energy .",
    "the thouless parameters defining the most general hfb wave functions @xcite are used as variational parameters .",
    "as it is customary in calculations with the gogny force , the kinetic energy of the center of mass motion has been subtracted from the routhian to be minimized in order to ensure that the center of mass is kept at rest .",
    "the exchange coulomb energy was considered in the slater approximation and the contribution of the coulomb interaction to the pairing field is neglected .",
    "both axial and time - reversal are selfconsistent symmetries in our calculations for odd-@xmath0 nuclei .",
    "triaxial calculations have also been performed in the case of even - even kr isotopes .",
    "the hfb ground - state wave function @xmath9 of an even - even nucleus is defined by the condition of being the vacuum of the annihilation quasiparticle operators @xmath10 of the bogoliubov transformation @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the ground and low - lying one - quasiparticle states of odd-@xmath0 systems , like the ones considered in the present work , can be handled with blocked ( odd number parity @xcite ) hfb wave functions    @xmath11    where @xmath12 indicates the quasiparticle state to be blocked and stands for the indexes compatible with the symmetries of the odd - nuclei , such as the angular momentum projection @xmath13 and parity @xmath14 in the case of axial symmetry .",
    "as mentioned above , we use here the efa to the exact blocking that preserves time - reversal invariance . in this approximation the unpaired nucleon is treated on an equal footing with its time - reversed state by sitting half a nucleon in a given orbital and the other half in its time - reversed partner .",
    "the microscopic justification has been first given in ref .",
    "@xcite using ideas of quantum statistical mechanics .",
    "the efa energy can be obtained as the statistical average , with a given density matrix operator , and applying the variational principle to it , the hfb - efa equation @xcite is obtained .",
    "the existence of a variational principle allows to use the gradient method to solve the hfb - efa equation with the subsequent simplification in the treatment of the constraints .",
    "the solution of the hfb - efa ( as well as the exact blocked hfb ) equation depends upon the initial blocked level @xmath15 . in the hfb - efa case ,",
    "the @xmath13 quantum number is selfconsistently preserved along the calculation and so does the parity if octupole correlations are not allowed in the iterative process .",
    "blocking levels with different @xmath16 values lead to different quantum states of the odd-@xmath0 nucleus , being the ground state the one with the lowest energy .",
    "one should notice that because of the selfconsistent nature of the whole procedure , for a given @xmath16 , there is no guarantee that the lowest energy solution for those @xmath16 values is obtained by taking the quasiparticle with the lowest energy as the initial blocked state .",
    "therefore , several quasiparticles with the same @xmath16 must be considered .",
    "in addition , in the present case and because of the presence of coexisting prolate , oblate , and spherical minima in some of the nuclei considered , blocked configurations with those quadrupole deformations have to be explored .",
    "constrained calculations have been performed to generate potential energy curves ( pecs ) for the even - even neighbor nuclei .",
    "one can find a systematic compilation of pecs obtained with gogny - d1s in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the case of odd-@xmath0 nuclei ,",
    "the purpose of the computation of such pecs is twofold : first , they give us initial hints on the evolution of the different competing shapes in the considered nuclei and , second , they provide a whole set of prolate , spherical and oblate even - even hfb states ( reference states ) for the subsequent treatment of the neighboring odd-@xmath0 nuclei .",
    "in fact , once a reference ( even - even ) state with a given deformation is chosen , we use it to perform an additional ( constrained ) hfb calculation providing an unblocked fully - paired state corresponding to an odd average neutron number ( false vacuum @xcite ) with the same deformation .",
    "such prolate , spherical , and oblate false vacua are then used as input configurations in our subsequent blocking scheme ( i.e. , efa ) .",
    "thus , the minimization process has to be carried out several times , using different initial prolate , spherical and oblate ( false ) vacua .",
    "we have repeated each calculation , for a given false vacuum and @xmath13 values from 1/2 up to 15/2 , using as initial blocking states the 12 quasiparticles corresponding to the lowest quasiparticle energies .",
    "the use of so many initial configurations is to guarantee that we are not missing the true ground state and all the lowest excited states .",
    "note that for nuclei in this region of the nuclear chart , there exist several competing shapes at low excitation energy and therefore our procedure assures that the lowest energy solution can be reached for all values of the quadrupole moment @xmath17 and mass number .",
    "being odd-@xmath3 nuclei , the spin and parity of odd-@xmath0 yttrium and niobium isotopes are determined by the state occupied by the unpaired proton .",
    "the spectroscopic properties of the odd-@xmath0 isotopes are determined by the one - quasiproton configurations that , in principle , are expected to be rather stable against variations in the number of even neutrons . however , as it is known in neighboring nuclei , approaching @xmath18 , the isotopes become well deformed @xcite and the abrupt change in deformation induces signatures in nuclear bulk properties like the two - neutron separation energies and the nuclear charge radii , as well as in spectroscopic properties . in particular , the spin and parity of the nuclear ground state might flip suddenly from one isotope to another , reflecting the structural change .      in fig .",
    "[ fig_y ] we can see the experimental excitation energies and spin - parity assignments ( a ) in odd-@xmath0 neutron - rich yttrium isotopes @xcite . they are compared to the one - quasiproton states predicted by our gogny - d1s hfb - efa calculation ( b ) , where the excited states in a given isotope are referred to the corresponding ground state , regardless its shape .",
    "prolate configurations in our calculations are shown by black lines , oblate ones by red lines , and spherical ones by blue lines .",
    "the quasiparticle states are labeled by their @xmath19 quantum numbers .",
    "the most important configurations are joined by dashed lines following the isotopic evolution .",
    "in addition , the ground states are labeled by their asymptotic quantum numbers @xmath20k^\\pi$ ] .",
    "experimentally , we observe @xmath21 ground states in @xmath22y , then we have @xmath23 states in the heavier isotopes @xmath24y , although their assignments are in these cases uncertain .",
    "the @xmath25 states appear as excited states in the lighter isotopes , while @xmath26 and @xmath27 excited states are also found in most isotopes , but especially in the heavier ones .",
    "the most striking feature observed is the abrupt transition at @xmath28 from @xmath29 to @xmath30 ground states .",
    "the theoretical interpretation of these findings can be understood from the analysis of our results in the lower figure ( b ) . according to our calculations ,",
    "yttrium isotopes evolve from spherical shapes in @xmath31y around @xmath32 , with the spherical @xmath33 shell in the ground state and close @xmath34 and @xmath35 as excited states , to slightly deformed oblate shapes in @xmath36y , and finally to well deformed prolate shapes in @xmath37y . in the lighter isotopes",
    "the ground states correspond to @xmath29 states ( @xmath33 ) , whereas the excited states correspond to the split @xmath19 levels coming from @xmath34 and @xmath35 , with @xmath25 states as the lowest excited states in agreement with the measured low - lying spectra .",
    "the excited @xmath25 states decrease in energy as we move away from the magic neutron number @xmath32 because of the incipient oblate deformation emerging , and they eventually become the ground state in @xmath38y . in the case of the @xmath39y isotope",
    "the oblate @xmath25 state is practically degenerate with the @xmath29 spherical state . in our description",
    "the nucleus @xmath38y displays a @xmath25 oblate ground state with a @xmath29 excited state at 0.7 mev and an incipient prolate @xmath30 at 0.4 mev that will become the ground state in the heavier isotopes @xmath37y .",
    "all of these heavier prolate isotopes present oblate @xmath25 excited states at energies in the range @xmath40 mev .",
    "thus , the experimentally observed leap of the ground - state spin - parity assignments at @xmath1 is well accounted for by the present calculations , which is interpreted as a sudden ground state shape change .",
    "similarly to fig .",
    "[ fig_y ] , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig_nb ] the corresponding results for niobium isotopes .",
    "experimentally @xcite we observe @xmath41 ground states in the lighter @xmath42nb isotopes with @xmath29 excited states at close energy and then we find @xmath23 ground states in the heavier isotopes @xmath43nb , although as in the case of y isotopes , the spin - parity assignments are still uncertain in these isotopes .",
    "a characteristic jump at @xmath44 from @xmath25 to @xmath23 ground states is once more found .",
    "the calculations from gogny - d1s ( b ) show in the lighter isotopes a clear correspondence between the measured ground state @xmath41 and the calculated ones . the observed excited states @xmath29 are also labeled in the calculations .",
    "they correspond to the excited states from the @xmath33 shell .",
    "however , at variance with experiment , our results indicate a transition in @xmath45nb to the @xmath46 oblate state .",
    "this oblate configuration is kept all the way up to the heaviest isotope considered @xmath47nb .",
    "the observed @xmath23 ground states are found in our calculations as prolate configurations at excitation energies between 0.6 and 1 mev in @xmath48nb .",
    "it will be interesting to see whether the experimental ground states of @xmath48nb are confirmed to be @xmath30 states and to measure the heavier @xmath49nb , where according to the calculations the @xmath30 states appear at a very high excitation energy relative to the ground state .",
    "the disagreement between the theoretical predictions and experimental data for the spin and parity of the heavier nb isotopes could be understood if triaxiality effects are invoked . in fig .",
    "[ fig_spe ] , where the proton single particle levels for @xmath50zr are depicted as functions of the deformation parameter @xmath51 @xcite , we observe for @xmath52 ( the position of the oblate minimum ) a @xmath53 orbital just above the fermi level .",
    "the occupancy of this orbital produces the @xmath46 oblate ground state in @xmath54nb .",
    "the @xmath55 orbital coming from the same @xmath34 subshell and presumably responsible for the experimental spin and parity lies higher in energy .",
    "the situation is reversed in the prolate side where at @xmath56 the @xmath55 is below the @xmath53 and is still above the fermi level .",
    "the easiest way to connect the oblate and prolate sides is through the triaxial @xmath57 degree of freedom , with @xmath57 ranging from @xmath58 ( oblate side ) to @xmath59 in the prolate side .",
    "it is obvious that the energy of the @xmath55 orbital has to go below the energy of the @xmath53 one at some @xmath57 value and it is very likely that at that point the blocking of the @xmath55 orbital will produce the ground state minimum .",
    "this is obviously a hand - waving argument as the @xmath13 quantum number is not preserved along the @xmath57 path but again , it is very likely , that both components @xmath55 and @xmath53 are going to be dominant in the orbital just above the fermi level .",
    "the above argument calls for the necessity of carrying out a full triaxial calculation for the heaviest odd - z nb isotopes which is , for the moment , not possible as it will require an extension of our present computational codes for odd nuclei to include the role of triaxiality .",
    "work along these lines is in progress .    in the next figures we compare the spectroscopic properties of the gogny d1s and d1 m parametrizations . in figs .",

    "[ fig_nb_def_d1s ] and [ fig_nb_def_d1 m ] for nb isotopes , but in this case the prolate configurations are not ground states . in the oblate case ( b )",
    "we can see for y isotopes the @xmath65 state , which is ground state in @xmath38y , the @xmath66 as a particle state and the @xmath29 and @xmath26 from @xmath35 as hole states , as it can be seen from fig .",

    "very similar results are obtained from both parametrizations of the gogny - edf .",
    "the only difference worth mentioning is that d1 m produces slightly lower excited states and then a more compact level density .",
    "this feature can be understood from its larger effective mass that makes the single particle spectrum somewhat more dense with d1 m .",
    "this answers our original question about robustness of the calculations and the reliability of d1 m in what concerns the spectroscopic properties of the two parametrizations .    to further illustrate the role of deformation and spin - parity assignments in the isotopic evolution",
    ", we display in fig .",
    "[ fig_beta ] for y ( a ) and nb ( b ) isotopes , the axial quadrupole deformation @xmath51 of the energy minima as a function of @xmath68 with both d1s and d1 m parametrizations .",

    "we can see that beyond the semi - magic isotope with @xmath32 we start getting two minima in the prolate and oblate sectors . in the case of y",

    "@xmath69 one can see the appearance of an oblate @xmath25 and a prolate @xmath71 excited states , which are almost degenerate with the ground state .",
    "the next isotopes , with @xmath72 and @xmath73 , display a slightly oblate @xmath25 ground state and then suddenly a transition occurs at @xmath1 to well deformed prolate @xmath30 ground states , in agreement with experiment .",
    "the calculations with both d1s and d1 m are coincident .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of nb isotopes , we observe the spherical @xmath25 states being ground states along @xmath74 in agreement with experiment .",
    "however , starting at @xmath72 in the case of d1 m and at @xmath73 in the case of d1s , oblate @xmath46 ground states are obtained at variance with the experimental assignment ( @xmath30 ) for these states , which is nevertheless still uncertain , as already mentioned above .",
    "a qualitative understanding of the features just discussed can be obtained by looking at the single particle levels for protons in @xmath50zr and depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_spe ] as a function of the beta deformation parameter .",
    "this @xmath75 even - even nucleus is in between y and nb regarding the number of protons and therefore its single particle properties should not differ too much ( at least at a qualitative level ) from the ones of y and nb .",
    "the insight obtained from fig .",
    "[ fig_spe ] can only be qualitative owing to the selfconsistent character of the efa that somehow incorporates the polarization effects induced by the single proton in the even - even core .      in figs .",

    "we plot the results corresponding to the spherical , oblate , and prolate shapes at the minima of the pecs .",
    "results corresponding to the ground states are encircled in each isotope .",
    "the first thing to notice is the remarkable similarity between the results obtained with gogny - d1s and gogny - d1 m .",
    "the only visible difference between d1s and d1 m is a somewhat better agreement with the experimental @xmath77 values in the case of d1 m , as it can be expected from its improved fitting protocol , focusing in a more accurate reproduction of the nuclear masses    for y isotopes , the measured nuclear charge radii differences depicted in ( a ) exhibit a sizable jump at @xmath1 where the radius suddenly increases .",
    "this observation is well accounted for in our calculations , where the encircled ground states show that a jump of the same magnitude occurs between @xmath73 and @xmath1 .",
    "as we can see , the origin of the jump is related to the shape transition from slightly oblate shapes to well deformed prolate configurations beyond @xmath1 .",
    "the charge radius demonstrates once more to be a nuclear property very sensitive to those shape variations .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the sudden change of the radius is perfectly correlated with the change in the spin - parity of the ground states studied above .    in the case of nb isotopes , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig_s2n_d1s_nb ] and [ fig_s2n_d1m_nb ] , the data are still scarce @xcite , but nevertheless a jump between @xmath73 and @xmath1 is also experimentally observed , although not as sharp as in the previous case .",
    "this is also associated with the transition from @xmath25 to @xmath23 observed in these isotopes between @xmath73 and @xmath1 .",
    "as we have mentioned , the calculations produce only a gradual transition from spherical to oblate shapes , but the prolate shapes associated to the @xmath30 states never become ground states . in order to follow the experimental trend",
    "we will need a transition at @xmath1 to get our calculations to the data points , which are explained in any case by the prolate shapes .",
    "we faced in the past @xcite similar problems in the case of mo ( @xmath7 ) isotopes , which are the neighbors of nb ( @xmath5 ) . in that case",
    "it was demonstrated that , for even - even mo isotopes , the incipient emergence of triaxiality was at the origin of the experimentally observed radius evolution .",
    "the quadrupole deformations of the triaxial minima were in mo isotopes very close to the prolate ones and therefore , their effect on the radii where also similar to the prolate case . similar type of arguments could be use here for nb isotopes and one would expect the triaxial degrees of freedom to be more involved , but our present technical capability prevents us to carry out triaxial calculations for odd-@xmath0 nuclei .    the results for @xmath77 agree in general with the measurements , but we get systematically a shell effect at @xmath32 stronger than experiment .",
    "this is a well known feature of any mean field approach @xcite , which is cured once beyond mean - field configuration mixing calculations , in the spirit of the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) , are implemented in the formalism . in any case , it would be very helpful to extend and improve mass measurements , reducing the still large uncertainties in neutron - rich isotopes .",
    "most of the reported measurements in this exotic mass region are based on @xmath51-endpoint measurements , which are not completely reliable because they lead to very strong binding @xcite .",
    "in this section we discuss the isotopic evolution of the charge radii in the whole region from kr ( @xmath6 ) up to mo ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "these isotope shifts have been found to be very sensitive probes of nuclear shape transitions and it is worth studying globally the whole kr - mo region discussing the similarities and differences among the various isotopic chains .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_dr2_global ] we have compiled the measured isotope shifts @xmath78 for mo @xcite , nb @xcite , zr @xcite , y @xcite , sr @xcite , rb @xcite , and kr @xcite isotopes .",

    "in addition , we can also find our results from gogny - d1s - hfb calculations , which are shown with open symbols connected with dashed lines .",
    "very similar results are provided by the gogny - d1 m edf . as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig_dr2_global ] , this mass region is characterized by a jump of the mean square charge radii at around @xmath1 , which reflects the sudden increase of deformation or shape transition that occurs for these isotones .",
    "the increase in the charge radii is maximum for y isotopes in the middle region and it corresponds to a change from oblate to prolate shapes at @xmath1 , as it was shown in the previous section . around y nuclei , we find that zr and sr isotopes also show this big effect that was studied in refs . @xcite and interpreted as an oblate - prolate transition as well .",
    "the same is also true for rb isotopes , as discussed in ref .",
    ". the behavior of mo isotopes was studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that the suppression of the jump has its origin in the onset of triaxiality that smooths the evolution of the radii .",
    "the case of nb isotopes studied in this paper shows strong similarities with the case of mo isotopes and triaxiality is likely again the reason for the discrepancies .",
    "finally , we also include results for kr isotopes , measured in ref .",
    "the isotope shifts for kr isotopes do not show any abrupt change , but increase smoothly with the neutron number n. to understand this behavior in kr nuclei , at variance with the abrupt change observed in the heavier neighboring isotopic chains , we have studied the evolution of the corresponding potential energy surfaces ( pess ) ( i.e. , @xmath79 energy contour plots ) in even - even kr isotopes with the help of constrained hfb calculations along the lines discussed in refs . @xcite .",
    "we find that the lighter kr isotopes present very shallow pess centered at the spherical shapes .",
    "heavier kr nuclei become gradually oblate in their ground states with prolate configurations at higher energies . therefore",
    ", the oblate configurations are stabilized in kr isotopes and we do not find any transition to prolate shapes . the result is a smooth variation of the ground - state structure and , as a consequence , of the isotope shifts . to illustrate this point",

    "the ground state corresponds always to the oblate shapes , while the prolate shapes appear about 1 mev higher in energy .    in general , our theoretical calculations describe successfully this phenomenology .",
    "the smooth behavior observed in kr isotopes is a consequence of the stabilization of the oblate shapes along the isotopic chain .",
    "the sudden increase of the charge radii at @xmath1 observed in rb , sr , y , and zr isotopes is explained by the oblate - to - prolate shape transition .",

    "we have found that the charge radii and the spin - parity of the ground states are very sensitive to shape changes in these isotopes .",
    "in addition , the signatures found are all consistent to each other .",
    "we have also shown that the quality of the spectroscopic results obtained with the recent incarnation d1 m of the gogny - edf is comparable to the one obtained with the standard parametrization d1s .",
    "we conclude that both d1 m and d1s parametrizations reproduce , at least qualitatively , the main features observed in the isotopic trends of the considered neutron - rich isotopes .    the observed spin - parity of the ground states exhibits a sudden change between @xmath73 and @xmath1 isotopes in both isotopic chains .",
    "this is a clear signature of a nuclear structure transition , which is correlated to the observation of a similar change in the charge radii . according to our calculations this structural change",
    "is explained by a shape transition taking place at this neutron number .",
    "the relevant feature to stress is that the jump in both spin - parity and charge radius is a signature of a shape transition , where the systematics is suddenly broken to a new situation . in the case of y isotopes ,",
    "the experimental spin - parities are well reproduced , except in the case of @xmath73 , where the calculation predicts a transition going across an oblate configuration , apparently not seen experimentally . in the case of nb isotopes , the predicted transition is to oblate states , while the experimental spin - parities of heavier isotopes do not support these results . since this is a region of an emergent triaxiality , as it has been shown in neighboring even - even nuclei , this is a plausible explanation of the discrepancy .",
    "finally , one should also take present that the experimental spin - parity assignments in the heavier isotopes of both chains are either uncertain or taken from systematics , and therefore , subject to revision .",
    "we have performed a systematic study of the behavior of the charge radii in the region of neutron - rich isotopes from kr ( @xmath6 ) up to mo ( @xmath7 ) to stress the manifest enhanced sensitivity of these observables to shape transitions .",
    "comparison with the available data from laser spectroscopy demonstrates the quality and robustness of the gogny - hfb description that is able to reproduce the main features of this behavior and offers an intuitive interpretation in terms of sharp or soft shape transitions , as well as triaxiality .",
    "the experimental information available in neutron - rich y and nb isotopes , and in general in this mass region , is still incomplete",
    ". it would be desirable to extend the experimental programs for masses , charge radii , and spectroscopic measurements to these exotic regions at existing facilities like the tandem penning trap mass spectrometer isoltrap @xcite at the on - line isotope mass separator ( isolde ) facility at cern and the ion guide isotope separator on - line ( igisol ) facility @xcite at the university of jyvskyl , or at future ones like the precision measurements of very short - lived nuclei using an advanced trapping system for highly - charged ions(mats ) and laser spectroscopy ( laspec ) @xcite at the facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) , where we can learn much about structural evolution in nuclear systems .",
    "although the present theoretical approach explains reasonably well the basic features observed in the data , theoretical efforts should be still pushed forward by improving the formalism by including triaxial degrees of freedom in odd-@xmath0 isotopes , in particular in those regions where this can be an issue , or by dealing with the odd systems with exact blocking treatments .",
    "the quality of our mean field description could be also improved from configuration mixing calculations in the spirit of the gcm with the quadrupole moment as collective coordinate .",
    "it is already known @xcite that such a configuration mixing reduces the jump in the predicted @xmath77 , as compared to pure mean - field predictions , when crossing shell closures , thus improving the agreement with experiment .",
    "this could be particularly relevant for the light isotopes considered in the present study , where the spherical minima are rather shallow . for heavier isotopes , the two minima , oblate and prolate ,",
    "are separated by spherical barriers of about 3 mev and appear typically about 1 mev apart .",
    "the effect here is not expected to be significant because a single shape would be enough to account for the properties studied .",
