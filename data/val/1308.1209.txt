    "recently , unusual heavy - fermion state with large specific heat coefficient is found in smos@xmath2sb@xmath3 , which is almost completely insensitive to external magnetic field@xcite .",
    "furthermore , in several samarium compounds , intermediate valence is observed experimentally , which is often combined with kondo - like behavior at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "these observations suggest that charge degrees of freedom of the @xmath4 electrons may play a crucial role in formation of the unusual heavy - fermion state in some sm compounds , and possibly in other systems .",
    "this situation is best handled by starting from the anderson model . in actual systems with valence fluctuations ,",
    "the @xmath4-electron width ( @xmath5k ) caused by hybridization with conduction electrons seems much larger than the characteristic energy ( @xmath610 k ) of the system .",
    "in contrast with kondo effect that requires the spin degrees of freedom , we shall search for a charge fluctuation mechanism that gives rise to a smaller energy scale .",
    "motivated by the situation described above , we consider the ( spinless ) interacting resonant level model ( irlm ) where an on - site coulomb interaction term is introduced between the local electron ( @xmath4 ) and conduction electrons ( @xmath7 ) at the origin .",
    "the model is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the annihilation operator of the bloch state @xmath10 , while @xmath11 with @xmath12 being the number of sites denotes the annihilation operator of the wannier state at the origin .",
    "in this paper we restrict to the case of @xmath13 and half - filled conduction band .    in the low - energy range , thermodynamics of the irlm",
    "is equivalent to the anisotropic kondo model as discussed by vigman - finkelstein @xcite and schlottmann@xcite .",
    "the irlm has further been investigated by many authors , and its application to the quantum dot in non - equilibrium has also been made@xcite .",
    "in addition , extension to multichannels of conduction bands has also been studied by perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) approach@xcite and numerical renormalization group@xcite .",
    "recently , a multichannel effect by the assistance of phonons was also proposed@xcite",
    ".    in spite of these studies , quantitative information of the model at finite temperature is lacking , especially concerning the dynamics showing crossover to the ground state .",
    "the dynamics of the irlm can not in general be reduced to that of the kondo model because of different matrix elements of physical quantities . in this paper",
    "we apply the continuous - time quantum monte carlo ( ct - qmc ) method@xcite to investigate the single - channel irlm for a wide range of the coulomb interaction .",
    "we pay particular attention to the case of negative @xmath0 , which includes a quantum critical behavior .",
    "because of apparently unphysical sign , some interesting aspects with @xmath14 has been overlooked .",
    "based on the numerical data we can test the applicability of perturbative analytic approaches and the phase shift scheme . especially , we are interested in the behavior near the quantum critical point emerging in the negative @xmath0 range , where the renormalized hybridization vanishes",
    ".    this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ section - weakc ]",
    "we rederive the renormalized hybridization by the perturbative rg approach for weak - coupling regime of both @xmath1 and @xmath0 , and then summarize the phase shift scheme for larger @xmath0 , keeping @xmath1 small . in section  [ section - ctqmc ] the ct - qmc algorithm is formulated and its details are discussed .",
    "numerical results for the irlm are given in section  [ section - numresults ] , emphasizing the dynamical property at finite temperatures .",
    "finally , section  [ section - discussion ] is devoted to discussion and the summary of this paper .",
    "there are many analytical methods to take account of simultaneous effects of hybridization @xmath1 and coulomb interaction @xmath0 , such as bethe ansatz@xcite , bosonization @xcite , mapping to anderson - yuval coulomb gas@xcite , and scaling@xcite .",
    "we find it most compact to use the effective hamiltonian method@xcite . in this approach",
    "a model space is introduced which contains only a part of the original hilbert space . if @xmath15 and @xmath16 are eigenstates and eigenvalues of the original problem as @xmath17 , than we require that the same eigenvalues , although only a part of the original ones , are reproduced within the model space by the effective hamiltonian as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the projection operator to the model space .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is constructed in lowest orders within the rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory as@xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the energy of the initial conduction electron state , and the original hamiltonian is divided as @xmath23 with @xmath24 including both @xmath0 and @xmath1 terms .",
    "the renormalization procedure is performed by reducing the model space starting from the original hilbert space .",
    "namely , the conduction electron states near the band edges are disregarded , i.e. @xmath25 is chosen as a projection to a space with conduction electron states within the ranges @xmath26 $ ] and @xmath27 $ ] , where @xmath28 is infinitesimal . during this procedure",

    "one may naturally ask why the weak - coupling renormalization and bosonization gives precisely the same result in the strong - coupling region . since both the perturbative rg and bosonization are weak - coupling theories , coincidence of the results does not guarantee the correct behavior around @xmath67 . in the following , we derive the correct value in terms of a phase shift , which is indeed very different from @xmath68 .",
    "let us assume negligible @xmath1 in the irlm , but large value of @xmath69 .",
    "then we can utilize the analogy with the x - ray threshold problem@xcite .",
    "namely , neglecting the interference between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the coulomb interaction is replaced by the phase shift as @xmath70 which takes account of multiple scattering by @xmath0 to infinite order without , however , considering intervening hybridization .",
