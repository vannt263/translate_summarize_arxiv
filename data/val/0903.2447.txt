    "alkali - metal magnetometers have recently achieved magnetic field sensitivity on the order of 1 ft/@xmath2 , previously possible only with superconducting quantum interference devices ( squid ) operating in liquid helium @xcite .",
    "high sensitivity is obtained by operating at a high alkali - metal density of @xmath3 @xmath4 in a spin - exchange relaxation free ( serf ) regime . in this regime",
    "the rate of alkali - metal spin - exchange collisions is much greater than the zeeman precession frequency , resulting in the reduction of the spin - exchange relaxation of the zeeman coherences @xcite .",
    "magnetic field sensitivity in the femto - tesla range opens a number of new applications previously accessible only for squid magnetometers @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is detection of biological magnetic fields from the heart or the brain @xcite , presently the biggest area of squid use . in this application tens to hundreds of squid sensors are placed around the subject to create a spatial map of the magnetic field .",
    "detection and mapping of brain magnetic fields has been demonstrated with a serf magnetometer using a large vapor cell and a multi - channel photodetector @xcite",
    ". however the flexibility of magnetic field mapping would be greatly improved if one could instead use a collection of simple , compact and self - contained atomic magnetometers while still maintaining high magnetic field sensitivity .    here",
    "we describe such compact , fiber - coupled atomic magnetometer .",
    "our approach combines several novel features necessary for achieving high magnetic field sensitivity in a small detection volume .",
    "it operates in the regime of high optical depth of several hundred on resonance , which presents challenges for efficient optical pumping and detection . in the conventional configuration @xcite ,",
    "a circularly polarized pump beam is tuned to the center of the d1 resonance to polarize the atoms and a linearly - polarized probe beam is tuned off - resonance to measure their optical rotation .",
    "the pump beam can propagate through the optically - thick vapor only by pumping most of the atoms into the dark stretched state .",
    "however , this reduces the sensitivity of the magnetometer , since it is maximized for a spin polarization of 50% . by detuning the pump laser off - resonance so that the optical depth is less than one it is possible to maintain the polarization of the alkali - metal vapor closer to the optimum value . for a pressure - broadened optical resonance the efficiency of optical pumping",
    "is not reduced when the laser is detuned away from the resonance .",
    "detection of spin polarization is still performed using polarization rotation of the light , which is generally the most efficient `` non - demolition '' technique of spin interrogation .",
    "it is also largely immune from laser intensity noise .",
    "the simplest method of light polarimetry involves a polarizing beam - splitter cube at 45@xmath5 to the initial polarization and two balanced photodetectors . however , low - frequency sensitivity of this technique is usually degraded due to motion of the laser beam .",
    "better performance at low frequency can be achieved if the polarization of the light is modulated , using , for example , a separate faraday modulator @xcite .",
    "however , this would not be practical in a compact , self - contained magnetometer .",
    "therefore we use alkali - metal atoms themselves to modulate the polarization of the light .",
    "the direction of the atomic spin polarization is modulated by a large angle using an oscillating magnetic field , which in turn creates a large modulation of the light polarization .",
    "the signal proportional to the dc magnetic field is measured at the modulation frequency .",
    "we discuss the requirements for the choice of the modulation frequency so the vapor remains in the serf regime . for sufficiently high alkali - metal density ,",
    "the modulation frequency of several khz can be used without significant loss in sensitivity , largely eliminating low - frequency noise associated with beam motion .    to reduce the overall complexity of the magnetometer we use a single elliptically polarized laser beam for both pumping and probing .",
    "this reduces the efficiency of optical pumping by @xmath6 and also reduces the optical rotation signal by @xmath6 .",
    "the light from a dfb laser is send to the sensor through a multi - mode optical fiber .",
    "photodetectors are incorporated into the magnetometer .",
    "off - resonant partially circularly polarized light causes a significant light shift and we discuss methods to mitigate its effects .",
    "we demonstrate magnetic field sensitivity of 7 ft/@xmath2 , limited by johnson noise in the magnetic shields .",
    "the measurements are performed in a vapor cell with dimensions of @xmath1 mm .",
    "this roughly represents an optimal magnetometer size for non - invasive measurements on human subjects since magnetic field sources of interest are typically submerged several centimeters below the skin .    earlier work on simplifying the operation of serf magnetometers using spin modulation has been presented in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "a magnetic field modulation technique was used to shift the measured signal to higher frequencies .",
    "however , the relationship between the modulation frequency and the requirement for operation in the serf regime was not discussed and separate pump and probe beams were used . in @xcite a single circularly polarized laser beam tuned to resonance was used for both pumping and probing the vapor .",
    "the optical density of the alkali - metal vapor was restricted to be on the order of unity to avoid excessive absorption of the laser beam .",
    "the noise in the detection of the optical transmission was dominated by laser intensity noise .",
    "the magnetic field sensitivity demonstrated here is about an order of magnitude greater than in either of these earlier papers .    in section",
    "ii we discuss the theory of atomic magnetometery using elliptically polarized light and magnetic field modulation in the serf regime . in section iii",
    "we describe the experimental implementation of the magnetometer , present comparison with theory and measurements of the magnetic field sensitivity .",
